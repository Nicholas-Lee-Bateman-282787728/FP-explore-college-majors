5115791,5,B0080JTCGQ,"Rich Martini is a talented filmmaker, and no novice at it. I'm glad he turned his attention to an examination of ""life between lives"" (LBL). His focus is informed largely by the work of Michael Newton, a hypnotherapist (no up in age; may he live long and be healthy) who accidentally discovered not only past-life regression but regression to the ""time"" spent between incarnations. You know, every time I hear George Noory--the preeminent host of Coast to Coast AM (2nd-highest rated radio program in the country)--ask question after question about reincarnation to his many guests who claim to know about the topic, I think to myself, If he'd only take my advice and become familiar with the work of Newton, his questions would be answered, and then some. So, whether or not you're familiar with Newton's two main books--JOURNEY OF SOULS and DESTINY OF SOULS--you'll enjoy Martini's FLIPSIDE. You'll get to see Newton-trained therapists in action or become interested in Newton's works and you'll get to enjoy Martini's take on the afterlife and will want to read HIS book, upon which the film is based and which goes into deliciously deep (and entertaining!) detail. Good stuff here. Money well spent (for a freaking change). And no, I've never met Rich Martini and I have no material interest in his work.",1340323200,2,1308,4.95
5115792,5,B0080JTCGQ,"This documentary is succinct, informative and incredibly well done!  It validated my own ideas by detailing others similar experience through video. While documenting some of Michael Newton's research into, not only past lives, but what happens to us between lives, Rich is able to present us with the answer to the age old question man has asked since the beginning of time....why are we here?",1338422400,16,394,5.061538461538461
5115793,5,B0080JTCGQ,"When I read Rich Martini's book ""FLIPSIDE: A TOURIST'S GUIDE ON HOW TO NAVIGATE THE AFTERLIFE"", I was enthralled.  I had just finished reading three rather life changing books by Dr. Michael Newton in which he described how he stumbled upon deep hypnosis as a means of taking people back to the womb, then  further, into a life previously lived, then through the death scene of that life, and into the place where souls reside after one life ends and before the next begins.  I read those three books in record time and was desperate for MORE.  Then I joined a forum which was created around Michael Newton's work and Rich Martini just happened to join as well and let us all know about the book he'd written which took Michael's work to a new place. He interviewed Dr. Newton, his wife Peggy, and several of the therapists who were trained at the Newton Institute. He even filmed several actual hypnotherapy sessions.  The book is written so well and the information Rich compiled is as astounding as what I'd read in Dr. Newton's works.

Then Rich told us there was a film!  But it wasn't QUITE fully baked...still needed some tweaking here and there.  FINALLY, after MUCH cajoling, coaxing, and, ok, BEGGING, the day finally came when Rich announced the VIDEO was ready and we could purchase it on DVD, video or we could stream it!  I bought it immediately and just finished watching it.

I had seen much of it in little clips that Rich let us view along the way, but seeing it from start to finish in it's final form was quite wonderful.  It was a visual representation of the incredible material Rich and the Newton trained hypnotherapists were able to uncover during Rich's research into this fascinating realm.

In the 70's and 80s I had read all of the Seth materiall (by Jane Roberts)  and it was quite similar but nothing as spectacular as Michael Newton's work because Seth was one entity and the writing was quite dry and technical and most of it way over my head!  Dr. Newton's clients were regular people from all walks of life and belief systems and they all told the same story more or less about the realm that we inhabit when we're not living a life somewhere else!  And to now SEE some of the Newton trained hypnotherapists facilitating actual regressions and hearing the information as it's being received by the clients undergoing hypnosis was such a special treat.

We even get to see a snippet of Rich's own regression which is also a real treat!  The video will certainly whet your appetite for more.  I would highly recommend, after viewing this video. The one thing I missed in the video which I LOVED about the book was all the stories Rich told about his personal experience with the supernatural, and the stories of his family's experiences.  So I would highly recommend watching the video and then immediately  reading the book which fleshes things out a bit and then following that with reading Michael Newton's book starting with ""Journey of Souls"" which is the first book Michael Newton wrote about how he virtually stumbled upon and ""was dragged kicking and screaming"" to this information and how it consumed the next three decades of his life while he painstakingly and lovingly documented the thousands of case studies he facilitated to come up with this blueprint of the spirit realm, how we get there, what we do there, who we meet there, how and why we come back again and again and how we decide when, where and who to come back as!

A big thanks to Rich for this video, the book and for continuing to document this material along with some of the dedicated therapists who want to bring this experience to others.

If you watch the video and want to delve into the work of Dr. Michael Newton and talk to others who are also interested please feel free to join the forum which is on Facebook:  The Michael Newton Institute for Life Between Lives Hypnotherapy.",1336867200,48,3898,4.625544267053701
5115794,5,B0080JTCGQ,"Richard Martini's Flipside the Film (the DVD and Instant Video both available from Amazon) is a follow up to his Flipside the Book (available in print and Kindle formats from Amazon).

As a talented film maker Martini is also a talented story teller. Reading his book was like listening, riveted, while a friend tells the story of his amazing adventures while discovering new lands.

In the film Martini shows his documentary skills by clearly and simply progressing through all the salient points about the life's work of Psychologist and Hypnotherapist Dr. Michael Newton. In just an hour and a half.

Dr. Newton's life's work was focused ""by accident"" upon the reporting by his clients about their experiences in a ""Soul Space"" between and during their human incarnations. With 7000+ case studies over 30 years Newton summarise his studies as ""Life Between Lives"" or LBL.

Dr. Newton's tool for helping his clients and exploring LBLs was very deep hypnotherapy. As Martini progresses through his documentary he interviews Dr. Newton and other LBL Hypnotherapists. He also shows excerpts from a number of LBL sessions including his own.

When I read Martini's Flipside book in the fall of 2011 the only other literature I read covering the same territory as Dr. Newton was Seth's three novels called The Oversoul Seven Trilogy (1973, 1979, and 1984). Seth's told his stories from the Oversoul's point of view - learning lessons at once from several of his incarnations in different centuries - who didn't know of his existence through most of the series.

Martini, in the book and the film, shows Dr. Newton staunchly determined not to read anything which may have biased his research. He didn't know about Seth. His client's point of view was from the view point of an incarnated soul who only experienced his or her ""oversoul"" in deep hypnosis.

Martini, Newton, and I describe ourselves as very skeptical. I come from a strong science background in Astronomy and Physics, Mathematics and Statistics, and Psychology. I'm not skeptical about Dr. Newton's research.

Although, I have slightly different (yet augmenting) perspectives, I believe that 1000 years from now Michael Newton could be more famous than Issac Newton.

I only have one technical critique of Martini's documentary. As I got absorbed in the action of the video, some of the captions disappeared before I finished reading them. Fortunately, pause and rewind saved me.

Watching Martini's film could well improve the positive feelings you have about yourself, the universe, and everything.

5115795,5,B0080JTCGQ,"Great documentary about the work done by Dr. Michael Newton whose books can also be found on Amazon. Rich Martini has made this documentary with many interviews given by Hypnotherapists specially trained by Michael. I believe this is the ultimate we have at the present day of soul regression which goes further back to previous lives. LBL (Life between Life) regression has opened up a totally new vista of Life beyond so-called death. Studies were made on 7000+ people and the results were staggeringly the same, irrespective of one's religious beliefs and cultural background.

Highly recommended, I give 5 stars because there are only 5 to give. Read also Michael Newton books as well as Rich Martini's book Flipside--all found here on Amazon. This work has started a spiritual revolution...go for it and see for yourself...you won't be the same again!!

Here is the site for the Michael Newton Institute [...]

The Newton Institute was founded by Dr. Michael Newton, author of the best-selling books Journey of Souls, Destiny of Souls and Life Between Lives Hypnotherapy--all found at Amazon. The organization began as The Society for Spiritual Regression but this name was later changed to The Newton Institute (TNI) to honor its Founder. TNI is the home of certified practitioners who provide the experience of Life Between Lives Hypnotherapy (LBL) to individuals throughout the world who wish to find out more about their immortal identity. Life Between Lives Hypnotherapy is a method, pioneered by Michael Newton, using a deep state of hypnosis, whereby individuals can access soul memories. For hidden within are memories of your life as a soul, between incarnations, your life with soul friends and family, planning your future lives on earth. This technique offers you an opportunity to experience a trance-induced ""superconscious"" state of awareness that brings a deep sense of love, compassion and an understanding of your life purpose. Everyone's experience is unique and personal so you can be confident of a spiritual journey that will fulfill your own needs and wishes.",1336780800,12,2087,5.205357142857143

5115801,5,B0080JTCGQ,"I'm giving this film 5 stars for content, because I believe it's that interesting and informative.  Technically, the film could use some help.  The quality isn't fantastic; even watching on a plasma TV with Roku, it feels like watching a movie off a 20-year old VHS tape. The regression sessions are really compelling, but many of those scenes are overlaid with paragraphs of text - which are also compelling.  It's difficult to absorb both simultaneously, and is, frankly, the mark of an amateur filmmaker (even though the director takes care to insert scenes from pretty much all his other (unknown) films and the end credits are on the order of ""Directed by... Featuring... Music by... Produced by... Film idea conceived in the bathtub by..."" with Richard Martini's name listed a dozen times.

He has recorded the books himself, and the recording is actually pretty funny... I would guess he has recorded them in his home or office because you can hear traffic, airplanes, children, fax machines, phones, etc... When he makes a mistake in speaking, he corrects himself on the recording. Other times he messes up or looses his place, so he will just repeat the sentence correctly..He also talks rather fast in a lot of the recording. But having said that, he really does sound like someone you could sit down with and have a conversation. He has a friendly voice and seems like he could be your neighbor talking to you.. What he says truly is fascinating, it's just that the recording is so ameaturish, it's actually funny... Still love the book though..

But, somehow the excitement and flow of the stories and information in the lectures did not come through, in the film, for me. The text was fast and  distracting to read while listening to the speaker and there were some sound issues. I think the film maker, Richard Martini has addressed these issues in other posts and has redone the sound. I know it's hard to make a movie and editing can drive you crazy after a while.

5115841,3,B0080JTCGQ,"I rarely give anything other than a glowing review.  But I need to comment on this video.  First of all, I am very glad I got to watch the hypnotized subjects instead of just reading about them. The subtleties of voice and body language were very helpful in determining whether these people were fictionalizing.  It appears to me that when describing prior lives, many were describing experiences they were actually having under hypnosis.  Whether those really correspond to former lives, I don't know.  But I am willing to consider the possibility, as I do believe in reincarnation.

But the in between lives stuff did not make sense.  The descriptions seemed banal and obvious and very much lacking in detail.  I mean, really, the wise guys are all wearing bishop hats?  I don't think so.  You get a cathedral of your own with 1000 people in the choir.  Who are these people?  They get to sing in a choir; you get a cathedral?

Worst of all, I think, is the idea that you get to relive all your lives with the same small group of people.  Really?  Yes, I can probably count 15 people who were super-important in my life.  But each of them can also count 15 people.  Maybe one of them is me.  But most of the others I never met.  And each of those has more people I never met.  There is no way 15 people all go through one life after another together.  Didn't Kurt Vonnegut dream that one up?

I suspect that the hypnotists are unconsciously projecting their beliefs into the minds of the subjects.  Kind of like the counselors who created sexual abuse memories in children who were never really abused.

Anyhow, I am hoping that the time between lives is a lot nicer that what is being described her.  I don't want a bloody cathedral.  A nice world without violence and Murphy's Law would be fine.",1408233600,,1799,4.509316770186335

5115849,5,B0080JTCGQ,"This documentary focuses on a scientific study by Dr Michael Newton and his research into the fine workings of soul and what makes us what we are. What makes his study so profound is that it was based on thousands of cases throughout his career and brings nowadays many more serious, clinically trained psychologists who independently obtain the same quality and type of his original results. It is a fascinating journey into the most hidden realms of what makes us who we are, where do we go upon death, how do we come back to Earth and how do we chose lessons and people we share lives with. This particular movie makes a very good overview of the core of the Newton work and provides colourful examples by volunteering clients and therapists alike. For a person previously unacquainted with the opus of the Newton research, this movie was sufficient to make a profound shift in my understanding of life and my inner workings as a human being and make me hungry to investigate further. I heartily recommend it to everyone who has a need to understand more about what soul is and how do we, as living beings, fit in the greater scheme of the Universe, without a risk of getting involved in any of the infinitely numerous ""new age"" teachings with or without religious underlining.",1398470400,2,1280,4.668141592920354

I think that there are other explanations for the people that were hypnotised knowing so much about the other people's lives.  I believe in a pre-existence, and that we have an inner circle of close friends and family with whom we were able to keep close attention to their lives.  Perhaps we were even one of their angels?????  Who knows, but it does seem to indicate that there is a universal God, and how can some of these events be explained without there at least being a pre-existence for all of us.

I think it is amazing that Richard Martini has documented Life Between Lives research and actually interview Michael Newton PhD's very last interview. I'm 21 and actually read Michael Newton's book when I was 17 and 18 and I can with all honesty say that he and his work has really changed my life since then. It's actually a funny story how I stumbled upon the Journey of Souls book. I was 14 and looking through my aunt's bookshelf for something to read one night and I saw the book and looked through it, couldn't tell if it was fiction or not! I was all thinking 'is this for real?'. I took the book home with my to read it later on. I had totally forgotten about it and three years later, I was looking in our bookshelves at home for something to read, I saw Journey of Souls and I thought 'hey, I never did read that', being a little older, as I read it, I was astonished at what I was reading and knew I had something really special on my hands all this time. About 2 and half months later, my very young stepbrother Liam passed away in his sleep at our home. Needless to say, we were all completely devastated and in shock. Although, having read Journey of Souls, I just knew in my mind that he wasn't gone and that we would all see him again, because of his books, I finally have real faith.

So, with what Michael Newton's books and work mean to me, I was very happy to see that someone was inspired to write a book about it, and I highly recommend this book and documentary to anyone who is interested in Life Between Lives, thank you so much Richard Martini!",1384300800,3,1626,4.262135922330097

It was like uncovering memories rather than trying to digest a tall tale.  I recommend the books very highly to anyone.

This documentary will hopefully inspire lots of viewers to read Newton's books and remember, as I have, the spiritual context for our physical lives.  Those who do will experience more ease, joy, love, compassion, and understanding in their lives and will perhaps lose their fear of death.

The documentary is low key and not slick, which suits the subject.  I found the imagery distracting, but I guess there had to be something besides talking heads on the screen.

5115879,2,B0080JTCGQ,"***SPOILER ALERT****

To begin with, the spoken portion of this film is barely audible.  I had to use a set of good wireless headphones in order to hear the dialog, and even then it sounded like an old worn-out phonograph record.  The sound kept moving from one ear to the other, and all interviews are heavily edited.

Next, throughout the length of the film they are constantly throwing text at you on the screen while they talk through it in the background.  Sometimes the text matches the spoken part, sometimes it does not.  I had to frequently freeze-frame the picture in order to read the speedy texts.  In any event, it made concentration difficult, and I had to hit replay constantly.

The premise here is that reincarnation is absolutely real because 4,000 (or was it 7,000?) test subjects all report ""exactly the same experiences ""between"" lives"".  This is patently absurd.  That plus the fact that people such as Henry David Thoreau, Leo Tolstoy, J.D. Salinger, Walt Whitman, and the Dalai Lama say so.

When the host asks near the end , if we are all choosing each ""re-born life"" continually....why we have not been more aware of this until now, he can only come up with two lame excuses: density of communities due to overpopulation and modern drug usage.  I guess he never heard of places like North Dakota or Alaska, and isn't aware of mind-altering drug usage in primitive cultures going back before recorded history.

I have always been interested in first-hand accounts of near-death experiences, but this is NOT what we have here.  What we have here is one or two ""expert"" psychologists asking us all to suspend disbelief solely because they think the evidence is overwhelming and they think we should agree.

Martini's use of music and visuals to go along with what the patients are describing was simply magnificent, helping the viewer get a better sense of what these volunteers were experiencing during their sessions.

I also benefited from the interviews with other members of the Newton Institute, getting additional (though complementary) perspectives to Michael Newton's.

For those new to this area, recognize that the movie only provides an introduction.  If you want to know Newton's detailed findings, you need to read his books.  I have just started reading Martini's book as well.

Since discovering Newton's work, I have often wondered why he is not better known.  In a more just world, Michael Newton would have received a Nobel Prize and be a household name.

I have some minor quibbles about some of the content included, though it is probably inevitable that no 2 editors would make the same choices.  While I found the quotes sprinkled in to be interesting, I think that they were unnecessary.  They amount to an ""appeal to authority"" type of argument for reincarnation and might detract from the much stronger argument provided by showcasing Newton's work.  Also, while it is interesting to watch Newton speculate about why a Creator(s) decided to put us on earth, this type of hypothesizing might put off someone who is new to his work and is not familiar with his detailed, objective, and systematic analysis of the evidence that he gathered over 30 years.

The down side of the movie is that it was very amateurish and with today's technology was a bit disappointing. The movie looked at times as though it was shot with one camera that was not even state of the art. The sound was the worst part because it would get very soft when people were hypnotized and very loud and distorted when the narrator came back on.

Suffice it to say I've never gained as much insight into between life activities from all the things I've read or seen in documentaries.

If one gains no more than 2-3 fresh insights into the meaning of life, the film is worth seeing.
And certainly most will gain a wholly new perspective on their relationships and earth experiences.
I cannot recommend it more highly.",1340496000,2,467,4.682926829268292

When I'm in a position to do so I plan to have a life between lives regression done. I highly recommend this dvd. Excellent!",1506643200,,267,4.36
8523619,4,B0080JTCGQ,"I received the cage in an approximate time.  However, it doesn't look like the cage in the photo. I did not order the black because it did not have the leg guards and was not as wide vertically from the base to the floor.  I surely would have ordered the black had I known there were no difference.  I even emailed in regards to this before ordering, but never got a response.  Oh well, I suppose I will keep it as I am not spending the shipping to send it back.  As for the price, the cage looks fine.  A little flimsy, but one can't expect much more for the price.  My heavy duty cages were much more expensive.",1505088000,,613,4.100840336134453

8523622,5,B0080JTCGQ,Excellent information.  This film answered most of my questions regarding past life regression and our goals as human beings.  Most religious people cannot innocently except the concept of reincarnation because it was removed from most church doctrine today.  The director did an outstanding job of conveying the loving welcome and life review we will all experience on the flip-side.,1496707200,,384,5.47457627118644
8523623,3,B0080JTCGQ,"I wanted to really love this, but I have such mixed feelings about this video. The pluses: Great insight into the people involved in this work, and it touches on many aspects and perspectives on reincarnation & LBL. The not-so-greats: The videos production values were way below par with distracting written overlays and variable audio levels.
I was hoping to show it to a friend whos on the edge of believing in the Reality that this video presents. But it was not structured, edited and narrated to make it very coherent or convincing. Perhaps that was not its purpose. However, as someone already convinced about LBL, I did enjoy putting faces to the books Ive read.",1490832000,,669,4.775862068965517
