7564668,5,B019648XAY,I watched Night Walker over thirty years ago at our local theater. When I saw they have it on DVD now I had to add it to my collection. Great movie.,1475366400,5,148,3.806451612903226

7564670,5,B019648XAY,"Always wanted a DVD of The Night Walker, with its creepy score by Vic Mizzy. Best watched with all lights off. Nice clear print. Second feature was interesting, a failed tv pilot for Kolchak-ish series set in 1890s.",1474588800,13,215,4.684210526315789
7564671,4,B019648XAY,"A failed pilot, this flew in under the radar of most Lovecraft fans in 1965, compete with a few allusions to that author. Produced by some NIGHT GALLERY and HITCHCOCK people. Not bad at all. With Leslie Neilson.",1466899200,4,211,4.578947368421052
7564672,4,B019648XAY,Dark Intruder is a a very fine B&W mystery from the 60s that has been unavailable on dvd up to now..Well worth a look.....Leslie Neilson and Mark Richmond are very good.....,1464739200,5,173,4.612903225806452
7564673,4,B019648XAY,i remember seeing night walker  when i was 12 years old.i took my 7 year old brother and it scared the beejesus out of him. he went screaming from the theatre.ahh fond memories.kinda of low budget but a fun ride.,1463184000,19,212,4.3
7564674,4,B019648XAY,"Night Walker was a good thriller/drama but nothing paranormal here. Stanwyck is regal as the suffering wife whose husband has supposedly died. Robert Taylor and Hart Bochner are solid in supporting roles.

Dark intruder was a short but eerie paranormal thriller that holds one's interest. Leslie Nielsen plays it tongue & cheek as the paranormal investigator called in to solve a series of grizzly murders. The foggy and gothic setting adds to the atmosphere. this is a gem of a movie.",1463011200,17,485,4.987654320987654
7564675,4,B019648XAY,"Rarely seen horror gem from the mid-sixties, this pilot (about an hour long) for an unsold TV series was released to theaters as part of a double bill.  It stars Leslie Nielsen in his pre-Airplane dramatic mold as an amateur sleuth in turn of the century San Francisco investigating a series of bizarre murders ala Kolchak but with police cooperation.  An atmospheric production, despite its limited TV budget, with a suitably eerie opening theme.  Produced by Jack Laird who went on to produce the Night Gallery TV series.  A wonderful example of what can be done on a small budget.  Too bad the series didn't sell.",1462924800,5,616,4.773584905660377
7564676,5,B019648XAY,"According to TOP 100 HORROR MOVIES, ""DARK INTRUDER"" is listed as 87 of the BEST! And I agree. Wonderful gothic settings, cloaked dark menacing stalker, chilling moods dominate this Chiller from 1965. In the other film, actress Barbara Stanwyck is filled with eerie dream visions at night. A Classic Double Chiller Thriller for late-night watching!",1459814400,14,347,5.327272727272727
8744151,3,B019648XAY,"scary movie, saw it when I was a kid, just wanted it for personal use but its okay",1526601600,,82,3.611111111111111
8744152,4,B019648XAY,"Night Walker is the William Castle 1964 production. Dark Intruder is a 1965 failed TV pilot produced by Jack Laird of Night Gallery. The two make for a fun evening 60's black and white thrillers'
Night Walker is more thriller and uses atmosphere over story. Not that it is a bad thing. The story has been done before but not with this angle. Barbara Stanwyck the female lead is credible with the frights and eerie feelings it gives us some one to care about. The movie has a solid 4 stars from me.
Dark Intruder is the reason I bought the DVD. Lelie Neilsen stars in this failed pilot as a dabbler in the occult who reminds me of a Sherlock Holmes type character. Neilsen is excellent in the lead and the show is well done and very gothic. Too bad it never became a series. I give this 4 stars also.
What is fun about this also is Judith Meridith has starring roles in each. Not a prolific actress she does show up in a few horror movies worth noticing.",1525651200,,953,4.2707182320441985

8744154,4,B019648XAY,The Night Walker was excellent. The Dark Intruder not so much.,1503100800,,62,4.7272727272727275
8744155,5,B019648XAY,"At last DARK INTRUDER has been released! Together with NIGHT WALKER makes this an excellent package. Top quality prints, too.",1496102400,,125,5.3
8744156,5,B019648XAY,"I don't have this dvd but I have the VHS of Night Walker for years and I have a copy of Dark Intruder from another collector. If you like
classic horror without blood and gore and great acting and writing and sets these are two forgotten gems. First one by William Castle
who produced many 'scary' movies is very good with Barbara Stanwyck! The second is a TV pilot which never made it to series which
is another goof by network TV executives! It's a great 'jack the ripper' detective story but with a devilish beast as the killer. Great make
up and originality for this type of story! Both are must have for classic horror mystery fans.",1494288000,,637,4.406779661016949
8744157,4,B019648XAY,"Very good suspenseful movies from Universal Pictures. I remember both ""The Night Walker"" and ""Dark Intruder"" from my teenage years during the  mid to late sixties. Both films are well done and truly full of suspense and mystery but ""Dark Intruder"" should be a must see for Leslie Neilson fans simply because it is one of the movies he made back when he was a serious actor.
DVD quality is very good.",1493424000,3,399,4.541666666666667
8744158,4,B019648XAY,"Sadly not available on DVD at time of writing, apart form the double bill ""on demand""
release with ""Dark Intruder, ""The Night Walker"" seems
to be one of William Castles more neglected films. It tells the tale of
a woman named Irene,who is haunted by strange recurring dreams, which
she eventually cannot distinguish from reality. Is she going mad or is
something more sinister happening?

As usual with a Castle film, the production is effectively made, even
with the evident low budget, the lighting and photography and
performances are all well handled. Barbara Stanwyck makes a good effort
in the leading role, and the supporting cast is fine too.

The story starts off in a fairly intriguing way with a bizarre four and a half minute prologue about dreams that has some superb kitsch imagery, and there are a few
chilling moments as Irene starts to experience her weird dreams. As
with a lot of William Castle movies there are just a handful of
exceptional scare moments that really stand out...I sometimes wonder if
this a fluke when he does this, but he can create some of the most
delicious scares, such as the blind hag in ""House on Haunted Hill"" and
the mute woman's hallucinations in ""The Tingler"". Well there are a
couple of shriek moments even in this more humble offering, one down to
the appearance of a ghoulish figure in fright make-up, and another,
when Irene think she has woken up from a dream, only to realise in
terror that she has not, and seems incapable of waking up at all, which
is quite a deep concept for the general tone of the movie.

Sadly at the half way point, things become less dreamlike and more
mechanical as a few truths are revealed and the layers of mystery are
stripped away. The last 20 minutes does not equal the first hour at
all, which may be part of the reason why few people rate this very
highly. Still, its a competent and entertaining piece of work, and
definitely worth seeing. What a shame it's impossible to find.

William Castle fans definitely should seek this out, even if they have to buy this double bill to get it",1487376000,3,2072,4.591891891891892
8744159,5,B019648XAY,Night Walker is a great movie! Thank you!,1486684800,3,41,4.25
8744160,4,B019648XAY,"The Nightwalker has several creepy scenes and has the great benefit of the performance of the ultimate professional Barbara Stanwyck.

Dark Intruder is about a Jack The Ripper type  terrorizing San Francisco. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Leslie Neilsen stars during his serious character period before his Airplane breakout. Not as enjoyable as The Night Walker, but okay.",1486166400,7,388,5.45
