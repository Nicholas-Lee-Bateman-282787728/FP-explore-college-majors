8104496,5,B000E222GE,So glad I finally had a chance to purchase this movie.  It's been one of my favorite for many years.  Love Martha Plimpton and Dermot Mulroney together!!,1416441600,,153,4.62962962962963
8104497,5,B000E222GE,"I watched it when it was making the rounds on TV and immediately became totally charmed by it, and in no small way because of the music. I immediately went out and bought the Dvorak string quartets.

I sure wish I could find an affordable copy.  With all the junk that is showing up on BDs these days, how could they have missed this one?

8104498,5,B000E222GE,"Where oh where is this movie?  I saw it in the theatres during the Seattle Film Festival and absoulutely adored it back in 1992 and now I can't find it anywhere.

For anyone who enjoys a coming of age story that is both endearing and avant garde, you'll be sure to be pleased with this selection.  Martha Plimpton plays the title role as Samantha superbly and her supporting cast includes a brooding young Dermot Mulroney and Hector Elizondo as Samantha's Dad.

Without giving away too many of the details - I do hope that someday soon we might be able to enjoy this film again!",1272240000,2,578,4.476190476190476
8104499,5,B000E222GE,"My wife and I happened to see Samantha purely by chance while on vacation and both of us were instantly charmed by the film. The story involves Samantha (nice played by Martha Plimpton) who discovers on her 21st birthday that she was left on the doorstep of her adopted parent's home.  In fact, she was not formally adopted and her birth certificate was ""arranged"" by the family priest.  Samantha shuts herself in her room, setting up an elaborate weight device that will set off an old prop gun, and decides to begin a search for her real parents, however remote the chance may be.  What makes this a fun movie is that Samantha's character is a bit off the edge. As a child she performs some bizarre stunts, such as believing that she can fly and escape from a trunk at the bottom of a pool like Houdini.  She has a character that will not take no for an answer.

Into the mix is Henry (played by Dermot Mulroney) who is Samantha's next-door neighbor and best friend.  An interesting aspect of the film for me is that Samantha has a natural gift for playing the violin (Henry plays the cello) and part of the plot concerns Samantha's giving up a potential career as a concert violinist because she does not know who she is.  There is some interesting music in the film, most notably Dvorak's American Quartet that is well played and adds an interesting dimension to the film.  Hector Elizondo and Mary Kay Place play the Stiggs, Samantha's parents, beautifully.  This is one of those films where the casting is perfect.  This is a charming comedy that says a lot about growing up and finding yourself and the zany antics of Samantha make it an unforgettable experience.",1194912000,17,1670,4.573825503355705
8104500,5,B000E222GE,"Like the other reviewer, I don't know why this wasn't/isn't more popular.  It is entertaining and the characters are drawn quite well.  The first half was very funny and the second half more poignant.  I have watched it many times, it is one of maybe 5 movies I actually own.  If you need a laugh without crass, check it out.",1185494400,11,325,4.366666666666666
8104501,5,B000E222GE,"I don't know why this movie isn't popular. It Is so funny to watch Samantha Stiggs try to find herself in life. Especially when she finds out she had been illegally adopted.

She goes through comical adventure after comical adventure trying to find out who she is and who her parents are.

If you enjoy funny but w/o crassness you will like this movie.",1170460800,9,352,4.484375
