761009,5,6304006063,"The Secret of Santa Vittoria is more than just a wonderful comedy, it is quite dramatic & touchingly romantic as well.
Nominated for 2 Academy  Awards and winner of 1969 The Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture Comedy.
Anna Magnani's performance in every scene is spellbinding. She simply steals the entire show with her masterful exuberance.
I can't say enough about this film. I believe Santa Vittoria is an under appreciated film and a lost gem by director Stanley Kramer, it certainly deserves a place in AFI's Top 100. This is one of  both Anna Magnani's & Anthony Quinn's best screen performances.",1479945600,,603,4.901960784313726

761099,5,6304006063,"This is one of my top 25 films ever made.  Anthony Quinn is mesmerising as Bombolini, the shallow Mayor of Santa Vittoria whose marriage (to the extraordinary Anna Magnani) suffers from his drinking and egoistical lifestyle until he is forced to stand up for something.  That something is an occupying German force whose mission is to acquire the wine harvest that the village is famous for.  Bombolini scrapes, scuttles and schemes outwitting the occupiers at no small risk to himself and the town, all the while tormented by his demons.  Funny, tragic and life affirming is how I view this movie.  An absolute classic.",1470528000,,620,4.923076923076923

The movie trebles the book.  Anthony Quinn was never cast better which is saying a lot, and with the combination of every member of the rest of the cast (mentioning Hardy Kruger who is excellent (though, in my opinion not as good as in ""The Flight of the Phoenix), makes for the perfect movie.",1450224000,,345,4.292307692307692

761179,4,6304006063,"This is admittedly one of the few movies I've seen where I have actually read the novel as well. I think it will come as no surprise that the novel had greater depth and scope than the movie and there were several character changes and event changes in the movie's screen play. That being said, I find the movie adaptation of this story fairly on track with the novel. It's entertaining, enjoyable, and fairly family-friendly. There are some mild references to sexuality in the story and there are some instances of violence which by today's standards would be considered moderate. The casting is just about perfect with Anthony Quinn as the wine-soaked, improvised clown of a 'mayor', Italo Bombolini, and Anna Magnani as Rosa, Bombolini's cynical, sharp-tongued, wine merchant wife. Also, Hardy Krger reprises his classic role of an imposing German 'Kommander', this time commanding the occupying army unit sent to 'secure' the Free City of Santa Vittoria after the fall of Benito Mussolini. In fact, the German Army's presence in Santa Vittoria is to steal the city's most valuable possession and life's blood, namely, its massive wine cache before the advancing Allies overrun Italy. This is an entertaining battle of wills which I highly recommend. ""Viva Bombolini!""",1444262400,3,1271,5.115384615384615

761352,4,6304006063,"Twilight Time is showing itself to be one of the independent leaders when it comes to licensing and releasing both classic and hard to find films on Blu-ray for the first time and that certainly applies to their new release of Stanley Kramer's overlooked comedy ""The Secret of Santa Viitoria""(1969). Originally released by United Artists, MGM(which owns the UA catalog) has provided an excellent print to Twilight with only a few minor problems. Not successful when it was first released, this joyous and entertaining film looks wonderful on Blu-ray and is very enjoyable now after forty years due in large part by a larger than life performance by Anthony Quinn. Filmed entirely in Italy by the great cinematographer Giuseppe Rotunno(who worked with Fellini) the village, people, and Italian countryside look very pleasing on Blu-ray which Rotunno establishes from the opening credits. These scenes are filmed in an almost  ""woven-like"" manner that makes the people being photographed appear like they are paintings come to life. This might be distracting to first time viewers of the film but once the credits disappear then the real beauty of the film on Blu-ray is front and center. There are some problems with night scenes were heavy grain is visible and in some scenes there are small scratches that appear for a few seconds but for the most part ""Secret"" looks very nice on Blu-ray and Twilight has given it a high bitrate(31.99). The main village where most of the film takes place looks excellent with interiors, exteriors, costumes, and even wine bottles having great color. Director Stanley Kramer brings out the best of his top notch cast with acting honors going to Anthony Quinn in his delightful full of life performance as the Mayor of Santa Vittoria and the great Anna Magnani as his long suffering wife. They both get excellent support from the beautiful Virna Lisi, Hardy Kruger and the various townspeople who worked as extras on the film. ""The Secret of Santa Vittoria"" is 140 minutes(Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1) and only contains the following subtitle: English SDH. The Audio(English 1.0 DTS-HD MA) is crystal clear and free of any noise artifacts(hiss, pops, etc.). Special features only include an isolated music score by composer Ernest Gold and the Theatrical trailer. ""The Secret of Santa Vittoria"" is a very entertaining and delightful film that viewers will find enjoyable now that it is finally on Blu-ray. It comes highly recommended.",1429920000,,2461,5.091584158415841

761355,5,6304006063,First rate performance by Anthony Quinn in very funny story of how an Italian village under occupation by the Germans during World War II keeps the enemy from commandeering the town's enormous supply of wine.,1421625600,,208,4.9714285714285715
761356,4,6304006063,"The book that this movie is based was one of the biggest best-sellers of the 1960's by the author of ""The Great Imposter"" (also adapted into a movie starring Tony Curtis). The book was hailed by one critic as giving a sense hope in a crazy world. And that's what this story is about, a kind of modern David and Golliath. Or maybe the town-drunkard-turned-mayor versus Nazi Germany.

The village of Santa Vittoria is no Rome. It's just a small town in Italy where the townspeople live very simple lives. They would be almost destitute except for one small commodity they all share: the town makes and exports wonderful wine to all parts of the world. They may not make as much as Mondavi, but it's a good living. Now, it's War World II, and the Germans have infiltrated the town. Not because they love the small-town folk of Santa Vittoria and want to protect them. They want their world-famous wine to help finance the war. But of course, the townspeople are dependent upon the wine for their livelihoods. So Anthony Quinn, perfectly cast as the town drunkard who ends up mayor, comes up with a plan. They give the Germans some of the wine and insist that they have given all the town possesses.

Hardy Kruger as the German officer in charge of the operation is unconvinced. They seemed too happy and too willing to give up their wine. He knows the townspeople are hiding more wine, and he will use all means at his disposal to retrieve every last bottle. The cat and mouse game is on! Can a bunch of simple-folk led by their clownish mayor in rural Italy outwit the likes of the German army? I vastly underrated movie that is mostly hilarious from beginning until end. There are a couple of references to torture but mostly it is quite a fun plot. Will Anthony Quinn and the town through sheer determination wear down the stubbornness of Hardy Kruger and the Germans, who seem absolutely relentless in their conviction that more wine exists? And now out on DVD!",1421539200,,1962,4.5710227272727275

Anthony Quinn's performance is one not to be missed.  He was highly under-appreciated in his time.  But he could do any part, play any ethnic character and be totally believable.  His Italo Bombolini, mayor of a small Italian village during WWII, is wonderful.  The rest of the cast is not shabby either.  This was a great ensemble group.  We see a young Giancarlo Giannini, the great Anna Magnani, Virna Lisi and one of the most handsome men in the world, Sergio Franchi.

This is a fun movie, not at all serious, downright silly at times, but all the better for it.

My favorite lines from the movie:
Town Priest: We don't have prayers to stop rain. We only have prayers to make rain.
Villager: You mean on Noah's Ark they prayed for more rain?
Priest: That was before organized religion.
Village: Poor Noah. He didn't have the church to help him back then, only God.""

761736,4,6304006063,"I had the pleasure of meeting the late actor and artist Anthony Quinn while strolling on the Via Venito in Rome in June 1978. He was a delight to chat with, and when I asked him about his thoughts on the making of ""The Secret of Santa Vittoria"", he smacked his lips and smiled--""Oh, I loved that film,"" he replied. And indeed many Quinn fans are especially fond of his performance as the mayor of a small Italian town during World War II. Watch it and enjoy a master actor at the peak of his craft. A fine cast joins Quinn, too. Verna Lisi is a delight and the late Sergio Franchi--a multi-talented Italian-American who had an amazing operatic voice and a heart of pure gold--demonstrates his largely untapped theatrical abilities. Quinn lives up to the wild title of his 1990s autobiography; he certainly danced a 'one man tango' in life!",1361923200,,839,4.562913907284768

761808,5,6304006063,"As an avid reader, I stumbled across Robert Crichton's book, ""The Secret of Santa Vittoria,"" years ago. It spent nearly a year on the NY Times bestseller list, but is now hard to find and virtually forgotten. What a treat, then, to discover this classic film based on the novel. I could give a million reasons for enjoying this movie--minus one, which I'll explain shortly.

Set during World War II, in the days after Mussolini's demise, ""The Secret of Vittoria"" follows the antics of a small Italian township as they attempt to protect their greatest treasure from the Nazis, a collection of one million bottles of their local wine. Anthony Quinn plays the role of Italo Bombolini, a bumbling drunkard, the town clown, who can barely stand up to his own wife, Rosa. Rosa is the voice of reason in the film, giving it the realism to keep it from swerving into the maudlin or slapstick (although she is very much a part of the comedy). As the Nazis near, Bombolini must enlist his fellow citizens in helping hide the wine, and must deal with his 16-year-old daughter's passion for a local boy. Most difficult of all, though, he must earn back the respect of his wife and keep her sharp tongue from ruining the town's plans. Along the way, the secret of the town is threatened also by the presence of a beautiful, high-society woman, an injured Italian soldier, and the damaged pride of a Nazi captain.

Directed by the same man who did the comedy ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad World,"" this movie is full of humor, political and religious sidebars, romantic interludes, and a bit of suspense. The actors bring vitality to each scene, sometimes larger-than-life, yet never going all the way over the top. It's a fine line, and they handle it to perfection. My only complain, my one caveat, is that the Nazis, while being clever and persistent in their efforts, never give us reason to truly fear them. In this sort of heartwarming film, it would be difficult to pull off this necessary realism, but it might have given more impact to the final half hour. Nevertheless, I adored the ingenuity and the surprising ability of one town fool to rise to the occasion, to face down his adversaries both in public and at home, and to never resort to the very violence with which he was faced.

Viva Bombolini!",1281571200,,2289,4.6330049261083746
761809,5,6304006063,"Anthony Quinn, once again, proved his class. Not to ignore the other actors, everyone played their role wonderfully. I recommend this movie to everyone who wants to watch a good, old-school movie rather than series-production, low-brainer, gamers taste of these days. I promise you won't regret you watched it, it is full of life, entertaining, funny, intriguing, and satisfying. It is typical Anthony Quinn.

761894,5,6304006063,"This film adheres very closely to the book by the same name, but dwells only briefly on the book's most unpleasant part. It is set in World War II German-occupied Italy, during the turbulent time following Mussolini's overthrow and Italy's withdrawl from the Axis alliance.

Word reaches the hillside town of Santa Vittoria that its fabulous wine reserve is to be seized by the retreating German army. The newly installed mayor, viewed as a buffoon by his wife and the saner citizens of the town, is faced with saving the wine from the Germans. He proves that not all buffoons are the same; some have much more common sense than they appear to possess. The film is a brief clash of two cultures where the apparent underdog runs circles around its supposed superior.

This film has humor, tension, love, and a dash of evil as it occurs within the backdrop of war. Anthony Quinn, who plays the mayor Bombolini, does a superb job, even if you are not an Anthony Quinn fan. The film should leave you smiling at the end.
It is well worth including in your video library.",1235865600,,1065,4.6

He becomes the new mayor just as the Germans are coming to occupy the village and confiscate over a million bottles of wine.  Bombolini comes up with a plan to hide most of it, but will everyone keep the secret?

Their scenes are full of earthy charm and raucous energy.  Handsome Hardy Kruger plays the German captain who tries to find the wine; he's quite charming but his playfulness and non-violent approach to war are a bit hard to believe.  Sultry Virna Lisi gives a solid performance as a troubled, snooty Countess who catches the captain's eye.

The movie, unfortunately, is too long by half, with the first hour  moving at a snail's pace, and the energy fades when Quinn isn't on the screen.  Still, I liked it a lot because the characters are endearing and the message of solidarity is a good one.

761897,4,6304006063,"""Secret of Santa Vittoria"" is a wonderfully flavorful comic drama whose major fault can be overlength which is apparent in the film's second half.

The town's lifeblood is it's wine supply and the German's intentions are to abscond with it and it's up to the fool Bombolini to outsmart the master race.  Hardy Kruger is equally fine as a German officer torn by gentility and his desire not to look foolish in front of these ""barbarians"".  Anna Magnani shines as Bombolini's hard-bitten long-suffering spouse.  The film looks great and you get a real sense of community here.  A real gem.",1224547200,2,860,4.738255033557047
762012,4,6304006063,"THE SECRET OF SANTA VITTORIA (1969) is a long, but utterly charming WW2 comedy about a small Italian village and its attempt to hide its ""pride,"" a million bottles of precious wine, from the Nazis.

Stanley Kramer directed this handsome adaptation of Robert Crichton's novel, which stars Anthony Quinn as the town's drunken ""clown,"" who inexpiably becomes the mayor and chief mastermind in the plot to deceive the German troops.  They are led by the honorable, but duty-bound, Hardy Kruger.

Also in the fine cast are Anna Magnani as Quinn's wife who initially can't stand the man, yet develops a new respect for him as he deals with the enemy, Virna Lisi as the daughter of the village's once aristocratic family, Sergio Franchi as the peasant soldier that she falls for and Giancarlo Giannini, playing a young villager in love with Quinn and Magnani's daughter.

But when he returned much later shouting that the Germans are coming to take the wine of Santa Vittoria, this was different! It was the beginning of an amazing adventure...

Italo Bombolini (Anthony Quinn), is the beloved mayor of the hillside village of Santa Vittorio... He is in terrible crisis... Where to hide his precious wine? l,317,000 bottles more or less...

Tufa (Sergio Franchi), who has deserted the crumbling Italian army and has returned home in despair, recommends him to conceal a million bottles of wine in the tunnels of an old Roman cave outside of Santa Vittoria, and to hide them in such a way, that ""if"" the Germans enter the cave looking for the wine, 'they will see an empty cave!'

Rosa (Anna Magnani) enlists the entire town for that purpose... When German commander Sepp Von Prum (Hardy Kruger) arrives, it becomes a battle of wits for the possession of the wine...

Von Prum is distracted in his search by Bombolini's protests of ignorance and by the Contessa's obvious charms... The local Contessa, Caterina Malatesta is played by the exquisite blonde Virna Lisi...

The last scene of the film is hilarious!

We see the German Officer leaving, and Bombolini - a bottle of wine in his hand - addressing him: 'To the captain, from the people of Santa Vittoria. It's not a great wine but it's not bad!'

The captain receives the bottle whispering to Bombolini: 'You're sure you can spare it?'

Bombolini replies: 'Oh, there's one million more where this came from.'

You can imagine the face of Hardy Kruger--extremely good as the German Captain...

Maybe the film is too long... But it is a great joy to see two legendary stars, Quinn and Magnani, dancing with the whole town of Santa Vittoria...

My favorite scene is when Bombolini finds out that Fabio, the local hunk, was making love to his daughter, Angela. He says, ""I'm going to punish that boy so that he remembers it for the rest of his life."" In the next scene we see Fabio and Angela leaving the church as a newly married couple.
