8475799,3,B005JJ0ED0,"This DVD is very similar to the Anxiety DVD, and my opinion is that the Anxiety dvd is 100 times better. If you can get a good price on the 2-pack I would recommend buying that, because I don't think this dvd  is worth $20.",1522713600,,223,3.9555555555555557

8475801,5,B005JJ0ED0,"5 to 6 stars:  Gary is a master at sequencing.  He has the ability to take difficult material and present it in a clear and concise manner in his lectures.  For those who are fortunate to study with Gary will find that creating a posture (asana) is not imitating someone else doing the posture.  We all have different conditions, structures, and backgrounds:  i.e.--ages, physiology, and psychology.

I found this DVD too energizing to do shortly before bedtime so I now plan accordingly and do it earlier in the day.  Om Jyotir Aham is a beautiful chant:  ""I am the radiant light of pure awareness.""  This programs has shown me where I need to work and that I must be careful getting there in my own time due to certain physical and physiological conditions:  minimizing risks and maximizing the benefit.

Any posture on all fours, face down (prone) or face up (supine) I must use extra padding:  a foam mattress liner with a sheet over it and a non skid pad underneath works.  Obviously for standing, I move off this and work directly on the floor.  Often instead of the final relaxation pose, I move into Constructive Rest Position as describe by Mabel Todd in ""The Thinking Body---A Study of the Balancing Forces of Dynamic Man"" :  resting comfortably on the back with knees up and feet at a comfortable distance with knees together and arms folded gently across the chest.  This reduces any built up stress in my sacrum and low back.

In practice #2 I found that chanting after the retention after inhale was quite difficult without taking a slight inhale after hold in order to sound the chant.  The other choice was to silently chant on exhale while  everyone on the DVD chanted.  This showed me where I needed to focus in pranayama and in doing daily activities.  I discovered I have a tendency to forget to inhale after exertion. One reason is due to cervical and thoracic issues that can be easily aggravated with deep inhales and long retentions.  For those of you familiar with Gary's: Yoga for Upper Back, Neck and Shoulders and the lectures, I have some of those funny sounding names relating to cervical vertebrae that also go into upper thoracic area causing nerve compression in the neck and brachial plexus with bulging discs on occasion.  I originally studied with Gary years ago for sacrum and low back conditions.

As I mentioned in my review of Viniyoga Therapy for Anxiety, I have been the primary caregiver to my 90 year old husband the last four years.  We both know that he is in his final life stages.  These two recent DVD's on anxiety and depression have helped me to start regaining some internal strength, which I can do something about.  The external conditions I can only seek to modify when I can stay calm and centered.

Thank you, Gary!",1405728000,2,2772,4.65979381443299
8475802,5,B005JJ0ED0,"A Yoga teacher recommended this video as a good general practice. The postures are dynamic and the focus is on the breath. I feel very energized and relaxed after the practices, and get some serious core stretching done as well. The teacher has a very clear and calm voice and explains the postures and the breathing so you can follow along easily. Of course, the first time I got a little behind, but subsequently I was able to keep up. I was able to do all of the postures and I haven't taken Yoga in many years. i recommend that you listen to the lectures before starting the practices - they really give you the understanding of the Yogic world view and help you understand how Yoga can be beneficial for those suffering from depression.

Like anything else, these techniques only ""work"" if you do them regularly. This video can guide anyone through a basic yoga stretch and breath practice but has special benefits to those suffering from depression. If you are looking for a good basic Yoga video - this is the one. If you have depression, I believe you will reap additional benefits.",1346716800,5,1090,4.589743589743589
8475803,1,B005JJ0ED0,"I've have been suffering from depression and found that yoga classes in the studio helps.  So I figured I would buy a DVD to practice at home.  I watched 2 of the practices.  Both had one person doing the yoga while the announcer talked about the how to.  The yoga participants look like they are made of wood.  No expressions at all on their faces.  They look more depressed than me.

Then there is chanting, which I do like when in the studio, but this was just lame.

I practice yoga to bring calmness into my life as well as to get fit.  There is nothing serene about the practice on this video.  Save your money.",1328486400,12,617,4.241379310344827
8475804,5,B005JJ0ED0,"Another interesting, informative, and useful DVD including lectures, questions and answers from the audience, and actual yoga practices.

Gary focuses on helping you strengthen self-restraint, impulse control, selective renunciation, rituals of self-care, and selfless service as ways of overcoming depression and re-engaging in life. I know how difficult some of this may sound, but, as counterintuitive as it may seem, caring for others when we are feeling deeply wounded and depressed is exactly what helps break us out of that downward cycle.

As always, I like Gary's use of adapting breath work to yogic postures, using breath with meditation, chanting, and his inspiring light imagery.

You do not need any background in yoga to enjoy and profit from this DVD, or his other one on overcoming anxiety. The instructions are clear and easy to follow.",1327881600,10,854,5.311111111111111
8475805,5,B005JJ0ED0,The practices are wonderful for anybody with or without depression. Gary's lecture adds also a lot. I highly recommend this DVD as well as the one on Anxiety.,1323302400,3,158,4.678571428571429
8475806,4,B005JJ0ED0,"NOTE: I received a free copy of this DVD to review for the web site Metapsychology Online; you can read a more complete version of my review on that site.

This DVD (along with its companion,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Viniyoga-Therapy-for-Anxiety-for-Beginners-to-Advanced-with-Gary-Kraftsow/dp/B005JJ0EL2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Viniyoga Therapy for Anxiety for Beginners to Advanced with Gary Kraftsow</a>), is the latest from Gary Kraftsow, yoga instructor and founder of Viniyoga Therapy in the United States. As with Kraftsow's prior Viniyoga Therapy DVDs, he has designed these new releases to include not only a practice element but also a strong educational component in the form of lectures on both yoga therapy in general and the treatment depression in particular.

The Main Menu of the DVD is broken up into two sections, Lectures and Practices. Also on the Main Menu, there is a link to a short (less than 1 minute) introduction from Kraftsow providing an overview of the DVD plus a second link to Special Features.  For the Lecture segments, Kraftsow is in front of a small group using a slide show; the chapter breakdowns are 1) Foundations of Yoga Therapy, 11 minutes, 2) Viniyoga Therapy for Depression, 16 minutes, and 3) Questions and Answers with Gary, 32 minutes.

Selecting ""Practices"" opens a submenu which lists the following options:
*Guidelines for Practice, 9 minutes
*Practice 1, Physiological Rebalancing
*Full Practice, 51 minutes
*Practice 2, Shifting Mood and Self-Concept
*Option 1, Full Instruction, 38 minutes - Explain options
*Option 2, Concise Instruction, 35 minutes

Kraftsow emphasizes five guidelines for practice: 1) breath-centric asana practice, 2) pranayama, or breath control, 3) chanting, which is used in the second practice, 4) meditation, and 5) modifying the practice as needed. The Concise Instruction option can be selected once viewers understand how to incorporate chanting that is used in Practice #2. (Note: the chant used in this practice is listed in the DVD insert; the words also appear on screen briefly.)

I have provided a general overview of each of the two practices below. Kraftsow provides all of the cuing via voiceover; he does not mirror his instructions to the viewer. Initially, Kraftsow refers to each posture by its Sanskrit name (which will also appear on screen), but he will sometimes follow-up by using the English term as well.

1. Practice #1: Physiological Rebalancing.
Compared with other Viniyoga programs, this is a more active, energetic practice. However, Kraftsow starts in a reclined position to set an intention and begin lengthening the breath. The first 11 minutes of the session continue on the floor (both lying and kneeling) with further work on extending the length of the breath. The flow sequences become slightly more challenging as Kraftsow adds in gentle backbends (e.g., cat/cow, upward dog). Some of the transitions (e.g., downward dog to upward dog) may be especially difficult for those new to yoga give that Kraftsow does not provide detailed information on form; also, he does not offer suggestions for modifications. This session concludes with 8 minutes of relaxation and pranayama. The brief (2 minutes) relaxation is followed by a seated pranayama session in which Kraftsow guides the viewer through varying counts of breath extension and retention holds.
2. Practice #2: Shifting Mood and Self-Concept.
Kraftsow begins this session in a lying position, first leading the viewer though a simple alertness exercise then continuing with some basic asymmetrical movements. Chanting is introduced about 11 minutes into this practice; shortly thereafter, Kraftsow moves into standing postures. Much of the chanting is done mentally--i.e., Kraftsow chants aloud and instructs the viewer to follow along in one's head. The final 11 minutes of this session involves pranayama and meditation. Kraftsow guides a lengthy exercise involving having the breath travel from the crown to the heart and back, then the crown to the navel and back, and finally the crown to the root and back.

Kraftsow's credentials and knowledge are undeniable. Unfortunately, however, as with his last series of DVDs, his approach is rather dry. There is no music to accompany these practices, and because Kraftsow does not perform the asanas himself, there is a general lack of warmth and connection to the viewer. Combined with Kraftsow's often overly intellectualized vocabulary (e.g., ""cogitate on...""), there is a rather cerebral feel to these sessions. As a psychologist myself, it is difficult for me to imagine someone with depression easily connecting with these practices--which is a real shame, as I have no doubt that they would be helpful.

One final note: this DVD is packaged in 100% Recycled Packaging, including a recycled cardboard folder (full-length but slimmer than a regular DVD case), recycled plastic DVD tray, and vegetable-based dyes. While I personally appreciated the eco-friendly approach, I did not like that the case was held closed only with tape (which tore at the cover when I attempted to remove it).",1320537600,20,5166,5.4555694618272845
