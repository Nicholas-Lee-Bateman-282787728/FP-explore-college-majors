1865231,5,B00008WI9R,"I wrote a lengthy review of the book by Laura Hillenbrand and I feel it is a MUST HAVE in your Library.
Now you have the chance to see the actual races and real footage of the horse and his jockey and trainer.
While the Movie will be another MUST HAVE in your collection, this documentary will give you the actual persons and horses as they were at the time.
I cannot tell you how special and important the Seabiscut history was, but this is true Americana, and this is a hero of sport and will. Anyone who wants to overcome the odds and triumph when they were not believed to be able to, should buy this documentary.
Movies are enjoyable also, but this is historical and should be grouped together with your purchase of the Books and the upcoming movie on Seabiscut.

1865232,5,B00008WI9R,"I am not a horse racing fan and know next to nothing about the sport. But I found myself watching this incredible story and was transfixed by it. Not only in this documentary gorgeously photographed, the narration, interviews and background material are all first-rate. It tells the story of the magnificent Seabiscuit, a horse deemed ""ugly,"" too small and too insignificant to make the slightest impact on the track. The documentary beautifully weaves in the hindered jockey, Red Pollard, who had broken his leg three times and was considered a ""cripple,"" in the jargon of the 30's. But Pollard and the Biscuit fuse together and beat War Admiral, the most fabled horse of the era.
You get to see actual footage of Seabiscuit pulling away and trouncing the noble War Admiral. I found myself jumping up and down, screaming, ""Go, Biscuit!"" Yup, this film is that mesmerizing. The rags-to-riches story and the ending, in particular, will leave you spellbound. This is a magnificent story, the only criticism is that it's too short at only 60 minutes.",1059782400,76,1047,4.954545454545454
1865233,5,B00008WI9R,"I imagine that the PBS documentary was timed to coincide with the release of the feature film.  It was a stroke of genius!!  I was channel-surfing and ended up viewing the documentary until the wee hours of the morning, i.e., 2 a.m., because it was so captivating and engrossing that I couldn't turn the television off.  After seeing the documentary,  I couldn't wait to see the movie.  I was the first one in line to purchase my  ticket for the first showing of the movie in my hometown.  I must admit that the film was poignant and well-made, which is a feat in and of itself in these salacious and superficial times.  However, with all of its cinematography, music and screenplay, the documentary wins hands down!  Every family, young and old, should get this documentary about triumph over adversity.  It is a true American classic and  it just happens to be about a horse (go figure).  The story truly defines character.",1059264000,18,925,4.6770186335403725
1865234,5,B00008WI9R,"I saw this documentary when aired earlier this year. I'm not big on horse-racing and frankly find horses a bit worrisome ... but I was spellbound by this story. And afterwards, I spent a lot of time thinking about why.
The documentary itself is a first rate production. Lots of historical footage and photos, interviews with jockey Red Pollard's daughter, Seabiscuit's ""biographer"", Laura Hillenbrand, and others, the story told with fitting understatement. That understatement serves to highlight what is (for me anyway) the core of the story: that in the late 1930s, events conspired to give this horse a second chance to prove its singular, raw athletic gift ... and it did.
There is a human side to the story of course. The horse's potential was coaxed out by a motley collection of, well, losers: a discredited trainer, a failed jockey, an owner who lost both son and wife. But without Seabiscuit's innate and unmatched physical power and spirit, their efforts would have have been wasted, and we wouldn't care about the story.
For me, the emotional highpoint of the story is the match race between Seabiscuit and Triple Crown winner War Admiral. The documentary contains full historical footage of this showdown, one that attracted a national audience of 40 million (remember this is the 1930s!). The grainy, black and white footage only accentuates the explosive start and raw speed the two horses unleashed that day, and the overwhelming physical power Seabiscuit revealed in the race's final seconds.
You don't need to know about horse-racing to understand what you're seeing: one of the few true pure athletes of modern times at the peak of his power. The documentary steps back and lets Seabiscuit speak for himself. It's the inspiring moment in a well-told story, and one you will find yourself viewing in your home and mind again and again.",1059177600,17,1853,5.0
1865235,5,B00008WI9R,"What's remarkable about this ""take"" on the Seabiscuit story, without excluding bestselling author Laura Hillenbrand's insights, which are also included - is feeling an exponential leap of emotion from an already spectacular book - when it's re-told, transformed and condensed into a fabulous documentary - all because you're now seeing the very thing you've long visualized in your head after reading all of her words.  History truly comes alive without a script or stunts or actors.
The emphasis on this all-too-short documentary is on jockey Red Pollard.  Why?  Because its filmmakers caught up with his daughter Nora Christianson, and were given tons of photos and color home movies that make the Seabiscuit saga jump off the pages of a book, as if everything happened yesterday.  You're suddenly in 1936 through 1940, pulled into a time and place by virtue of looking at something that feels newly minted and accessible.  Just tremendous.
The start-to-finish stretch calls are exciting, even more than they could ever be in the book or in the just released movie.  Moreover, the re-telling of every imaginable setback that befell Charles Howard, Red Pollard and Seabiscuit - well, it doesn't matter that you already know the ending, this documentary is still thrilling.  In fact, you will still shed tears despite the lack of surprises associated with this all-too-enormously wonderful tale.
What I find astonishing and oddly surreal is that interest in Seabiscuit's tale has been revived as a result of Hillenbrand's wonderful 2001 book - and, combined with this documentary and the Universal-Dreamworks movie - a kind of manic fascination is repeating itself, involving greater numbers of people in this nation of 275 million than those who were alive in 1938, 65 years later.
However, like all great stories, there is a downside.  And that's trying to boil down the history of the world in 60 minutes.  Impossible.  Yes, I understand the constraints.
So perhaps my only criticism about this otherwise fine documentary is the lack of an historic post-script.  Dwelling on the rags-to-riches tale of three men and a horse - without bringing the true life ""ending"" (post-1940) back down to earth - feels incomplete.  Seabiscuit went on to sire many foals, none of 'em real winners, and then died in 1947 at the age of 14.  This is a glaring omission that could've been dispensed with in a few lines of type just before the credits speed all too quickly at the end.  It almost seems this portion was purposely left out to keep things from feeling bittersweet, to maintain a spirit of uplift, much as you'd expect from Hollywood, but not from documentarians.  This post-script, in my mind, the ""life as it all turned out"" portion after 1940, would've taken nothing away from the heroism of Seabiscuit's tale.  He captured a nation at a time when it really needed it.  Don't you think some viewers would want to know what happened to Charles Howard, Red Pollard and Tom Smith?
So while this DVD is a keeper - it does makes one wish for a ""director's cut"" - even for a documentary!  A ""special edition"" perhaps?  But this feeling of truncation is a reminder that it was designed to fill a television slot, hence could not go over its allocated 60 minutes.
The bigger picture though, is I guess this doesn't matter when you have a winner of a story and a fab-documentary that's still 99 percent great.",1059091200,18,3400,4.9125874125874125
1865236,5,B00008WI9R,"After reading Hillenbrand's captivating book last year, I was really looking forward to this PBS special, and it did not disappoint.  Lots of footage of Seabiscuit, on and off the track, and he's even more captivating on screen than I expected (and I'm someone who generally prefers the written image to the visual one). The producers do an excellent job of setting the larger historical context, and of weaving in interviews with a wide variety of people, including Hillenbrand and Red Pollard's daughter, whose comments were very poignant.  The biggest compliment I can give this show is that it will appeal to both those who have and have not read the book.  For the latter, it covers not only the highlights of Seabiscuit's career, but also his low points, and the heartbreak of Pollard's life, and the hardship of a typical jockey's life, as well. It covers much ground in only an hour without seeming rushed or crowded.  The producers did well in selecting material. For those who have read the book, I found the story just as fresh and exciting the second time around. It's a wonderful compliment to the book, and made me want to go back and reread it.  The closeup footage of actual races is mesmerizing, more dramatic than any artificial special effects in Hollywood movies.  I understand that a movie version is coming out soon, but I can't imagine it equalling, much less surpassing, this documentary.  In this case, I'm betting that Plato's injunction against deception of art will prove true: the real thing is better than an imitation.  The only thing better than this documentary would be a ride on the Great Horse himself.",1050969600,74,1638,4.825

There is testimony from Red Pollard's daughter, lovely footage, and the historical references are spot on.  It is important to remember that Seabiscuit prevailed at a time when US morale needed him most.

Looking at Seabiscuit's front legs I would have been too afraid to race him if I had owned him because of the strain on those front legs.  Yet the horse turned out to be lightning fast!  With the care of those who loved him he stayed sound for the most part even though he had been terribly overworked.  This video is wonderful because of the actual footage it contains and the way it helps you get a feeling for the time period and what that horse meant to people living at that time.

1865298,5,B00008WI9R,"I read Laura Hillenbrand's book on Seabiscuit and totally fell in love with the horse.  So I ordered two cds on his life: the movie, and this documentary.  Although the movie was entertaining, it strayed from the true story, as most movies just about have to, but this documentary was awesome.  To see the actual footage of some of these fantastic races was so exciting.  It was also great to ""meet"" the real people in Seabiscuit's life.",1275696000,2,437,4.636363636363637
1865299,5,B00008WI9R,"It's extremely difficult for us in this day and age to conceive of how a broken-down animal could possibly lift America out of the Great Depression, but that's exactly what Seabiscuit did.  This documentary conveys that in a beautiful way, revealing facts about the horse and jockey not addressed in the movie.

Seabiscuit was an angry horse when Tom Smith first saw him on the track.  He'd been trained to lose and was considered lazy with a lopsided 'eggbeater' gait caused by a lack of calcium in his feed.  Tom immediately put him on a diet of Timothy hay, far more expensive than alfalfa and fairly rare in California.  He was tired and depressed.  There is footage in this film showing the horse kicking out in a mean-spirited way as he was getting a bath and he really hated people at the beginning.

This is a rich documentary that's well-done.  In case you're interested, Seabiscuit has a few descendants still living at the American Legend Horse Farm in Northern California.",1246838400,8,984,4.747058823529412
1865300,5,B00008WI9R,"""Seabiscuit,"" the American Experience, PBS DVD Video, 60 minutes in length, is an extremely well-done and comprehensive story of the horse that became America's great celebrity during the Depression when horseracing was the number one spectator sport. Dubbed affectionately the Biscuit by her admirers, this documentary traces the rise of a broken-down gawky looking racehorse and her accident-prone, down and out jockey, John ""Red"" Pollard.
 The people in the Depression needed come-from-behind losers to give them hope. Seabiscuit did not have an unbroken string of victories. She was an also-ran in several big races. It was only at the end of his career that the Biscuit on the third try won the Santa Anita Handicap in 1940. Her greatest triumph was winning a match race against the triple-crown winner, War Admiral.
 The documentary has very good footage of the races and it brings back memories hearing Clem McCarthy, the legendary NBC racetrack announcer, calling the races. Radio was in its early days, and it became more of a media force because millions of people listened to the races over the airwaves.
 The narrative is well-done, and the film hits the highlights in the careers of horse and jockey in a concise and absorbing fashion. It looks and feel authentic. Many docus plod along and are an effort to watch--not this one. It helps to bring the thirties to life: an era that needed heroes and found them in a ungainly horse and a unlucky jockey who evolved into winners and national heroes. This DVD will provide a complementary experience for viewers of the Toby Maguire flick.",1242864000,5,1597,4.996240601503759

1865305,5,B00008WI9R,"Okay, the only question here is whether you would enjoy watching this PBS ""American Experience"" documentary about Seabiscuit after watching the hit theatrical film. The answer is yes.
The match race between Seabiscuit and War Admiral goes exactly like it was done in the film, but there is something to be said for watching footage of the actual race. Seabiscuit lets War Admiral catch up with him but holds off the challenger and blows past him on the straightaway, pulling away at the end. The footage and shots of Red Pollard sitting on top of the 7-year-old Seabiscuit after finally winning the Santa Anita $100,000 race are quite poignant and there is also the fact that you actually get to see Seabiscuit it all his awkward glory.
This documentary shows that the theatrical film is essentially faithful to the dramatic highpoints of Seabiscuit's racing career. In terms of the human beings in the horse's life that boils down to his trainer Tom Smith in the first half of the documentary and his jockies, primarily Red Pollard, in the second. This has to be because the idea that both horse and rider could come back from problems that left the pair with four good legs between them is a story that writes itself.
When ESPN put Secretariat on its list of the 50 Greatest Athletes of all time I had no problem with that. I have a pet theory that says you really fall in love with only one horse in your life; for some that would be Black Beauty or the Pie or Trigger or Citation or the one in their own stable. For me it was Secretariat. But I can see where lots of people could end up falling in love with this funny looking horse that died long before they were born could become the horse of their heart.
So, whether you come to the documentary from the theatrical film or go to the movies after catching this documentary on PBS during the current pledge drive, I think that you will be satisfied either way. My suggestion would be go to the movies for the Hollywood version and then check out the real thing on this nice little documentary.",1114819200,8,2049,4.525606469002695

This one hour documentary is filled with magnificent old photos and fabulous film of Seabiscuit as he races and even when he first comes to the Howard barn.

1865321,5,B00008WI9R,"I was unaware of the story of racehorse Seabiscuit until viewing this terrific American Experience PBS documentary one evening. To say I was inspired and moved would be an understatement. What a great American story this is, absolutely proving that truth is stranger (if not more exciting) than fiction.
For years, American Experience (AE) has produced timely and thought-provoking documentaries about our nation's denizens. This is the first time I can recall AE producing a documentary about not only a sports-related figure, but also an animal. The Seabiscuit story involves a variety of colorful, down-on-their-luck characters symbolizing America's struggle with the Depression. Standing out ahead of the pack is the story of unlucky rider Red Pollard, Seabiscuit's main jockey. AE filmmakers have done a superb job weaving relative and friend interviews with actual footage of Red, bringing to life a man whose heroism symbolized the American Dream.
This is where the ""Seabiscuit"" documentary is eventually superior to the film version (which came out the same year). The actual footage of these true-to-life characters is far more interesting than Hollywood's recreation. The narration by husky-voiced actor Scott Glenn is also the perfect accompaniment to the story, well written, succinct and humorous.
The race that defined the legend of Seabiscuit was his one-on-one battle with Triple Crown winner War Admiral. The documentary's build-up to this incredible showdown appropriately generates suspense, expertly creating a ""you are there"" sensation. And the race itself, shown in its entirety, turned out to be one of the most intense battles of all time. Viewers unaware of the outcome are in for a dramatic moment.
Amazingly, Seabiscuit's story did not end with the epic War Admiral clash. And AE's documentation of the final triumph of the storied horse and his jockey Red will bring a tear to most viewer eyes. Author Laura Hillenbrand, whose best selling novel ""Seabiscuit: An American Legend"" did much to revive this tale for a 21st century generation, is also on hand to offer profound insight into the horse's legend. Her comments get to the root of the story's meaning in relation to the fabric of America.
""Seabiscuit"" is an inspiring documentary, appropriately detailed with historic photographs, old news clippings and newsreel footage, combined with telling interviews and period music. It's hard to imagine this story not touching viewers, no matter the age.",1071705600,23,2480,5.377892030848329

This documentary shows that the theatrical film is essentially faithful to the dramatic highpoints of Seabiscuit's racing career.  In terms of the human beings in the horse's life that boils down to his trainer Tom Smith in the first half of the documentary and his jockies, primarily Red Pollard, in the second.  This has to be because the idea that both horse and rider could come back from problems that left the pair with four good legs between them is a story that writes itself.
When ESPN put Secretariat on its list of the 50 Greatest Athletes of all time I had no problem with that.  I have a pet theory that says you really fall in love with only one horse in your life; for some that would be Black Beauty or the Pie or Trigger or Citation or the one in their own stable.  For me it was Secretariat.  But I can see where lots of people could end up falling in love with this funny looking horse that died long before they were born could become the horse of their heart.
So, whether you come to the documentary from the theatrical film or go to the movies after catching this documentary on PBS during the current pledge drive, I think that you will be satisfied either way.  My suggestion would be go to the movies for the Hollywood version and then check out the real thing on this nice little documentary.",1060819200,27,2058,4.525606469002695
