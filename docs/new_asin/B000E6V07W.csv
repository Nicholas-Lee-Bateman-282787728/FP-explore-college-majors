He squirmed through Brer Fox trying to eat Brer Rabbit, and the Buzzard trying to eat him, and the alligator, but when the bear had him, it was too scarey.  He has seen Curious George, Toy Story 2, and the Little Bear Movie, and enjoyed them.  You can guage from that wheher this is appropriae for your preschooler.  I couldn't help but laugh myself.",1146700800,14,433,4.2439024390243905

2505428,5,B000E6V07W,"While this movie may not be the same as Disney's classic ""Song Of The

South"", this direct-to-video film is a beautifully animated, clean,

wholesome, entertaining family film. This movie is filled with very

memorable characters, plenty of adventure, a lot of captivating

stories, great moral lessons, and superb animation. This film also has

a lot of clean humor without any of the sexual innuendo, lame puns, or

gross-out humor that's found in many animated T.V. shows and films

nowadays. Even though this film is aimed at small children, you can

enjoy this movie whether you're 4 or 40, and it's great for the whole

family to watch together (or by yourself). On a scale of 1 to 10, I

give this film a 10 all the way! You will not be disappointed.",1143504000,31,757,4.666666666666667

2505535,5,B000E6V07W,"I ordered this movie because I so enjoyed Uncle Remus' wonderful stories in Song of the South as a kid; and  I loved the wonderful songs to go with those stories. So, I was a bit disappointed that this did not include any of those songs or any similarity to the old Disney Brer Rabbit stories.  That being said, it is a fun, entertaining DVD.  I have a 5 year old and she has really enjoyed it.  It is told in small stories so it can be watched in one sitting or in little bits and pieces which is great for us. There a few good lessons in it but mostly it is just entertaining. Children aren't going to learn any deep invaluable lessons, but they also are not going to pick up any sassy, argumentative behavior from it either. No rude humor but no sappy overly goody-two-shoed characters either. I love the soulful spunkiness of Brer Rabbit and his positive outlook towards adversity. It is not complex but it is clever.  Just clean fun. It is a little different in a refreshing way from the usual animated entertainment for children. I high recommend especially since I noticed it was on sale!",1357603200,3,1095,4.400990099009901

2505537,5,B000E6V07W,"Our grandsons (ages 4 & 6) relish their sleepovers with Papa and Grandma.  Our days are spent exploring the out doors and the evenings include popping pop corn, turning off the lights and watching a fun movie.  The challenge for P & G is finding suitable viewing that is fun for all .... we are easy!  The Adventures of Brer Rabbit has been a big hit which they love seeing more than once.  They particularly enjoy how Brer Rabbit outwits those who would like to eat him.  Great fun for everyone!  I would highly recommend it for general audience viewing.",1354060800,,555,4.5
2505538,3,B000E6V07W,As a kid I remember the adventures of Ber rabbit as narrated by Uncle Remus and I inadvertantly thought this was it. I'll keep looking as enjoyed them when I was young and would like my grandchildren to see them also.,1353974400,2,217,4.317073170731708
2505539,5,B000E6V07W,"Folks, let's get real, don't follow the stupidity of overanalyzing this with PC interpretations and looking for hidden messages about race relations and slavery. This film is not about any of that! It's basically a charming little story about a little girl whose mother sends her out to play and she meets a turtle (Danny Glover) who introduces her to the wonderful world of the Brer Rabbit stories.

Although this is based more on folkmaster Julius Lester's translations (from the original heavy dialect of Joel Chandler Harris's 19th century transcriptions of these slave stories) than the Disney film, its still quite good and the original wascally wabbit's tales are quite entertaining. Wanda Sykes is particularly loveable as Sister Moon and Nick Cannon is well cast as the heroic hare.

Children are bound to love this and adults (once they stop the overanalysis) will enjoy it too with an open mind. As for the comparison with SONG OF THE SOUTH, this one has more on Brer Rabbit and the ""creetures"" (as Uncle Remus pit it) than Uncle Remus himself. SOTS ony had three cartoons dealing with Brer Rabbit while this has about three times as many episodes. I look at this more as a modern counterpart to SOTS as opposed to something that degrades the older film (I personally feels this compliments both SOTS and the Joel Harris books). In either case, get it and laugh.",1295308800,5,1373,4.8382978723404255
2505540,5,B000E6V07W,"I grew up listening to Br'er Rabbit Tales.  For those who think that Br'er Rabbit is inseparable from Uncle Remus, Uncle Remus was invented as a way to tell the stories when it was transcribed by a White Atlantan journalist who heard the tales from Black sharecroppers on a plantantion.  Uncle Remus is not essential to the Br'er Rabbit tales, which are the result of African American and Native American oral traditions, and are told just fine without him there.  This DVD does a fine job of giving us a good many Br'er Rabbit stories.  I thought it was a cute retelling, nice animation, and a good range of voices from plenty of African American actors.  My kids enjoyed watching it, and I got to share a bit of what I grew up hearing at the many story festivals I attended as a little girl.  For those who are disappointed that this isn't Song of the South, give Br'er Rabbit a chance in a movie that actually focuses on Br'er Rabbit... unless it wasn't Br'er Rabbit that interested you in the first place...",1274918400,3,1011,4.497267759562842

2505553,1,B000E6V07W,"This ""remake"" is garbage.

I had a book, as a child that was titled ""Adventures of Brer Rabbit"" and this ""remake"" DVD is  not even close to what the real story is supposed to be.

This is one of Disney's worst dvd releases ever made. They should be forced to re-title this dvd so that people do not accidentally buy this trash.",1264204800,6,327,4.241935483870968
2505554,4,B000E6V07W,"Cute.  Brought up to date.  And far less controversy than the Song of the South created.  But as cute as it is, Brer Rabbit is still the Brer Rabbit we knew and loved in Song of the South.  It will be great when Disney wakes up and releases that movie again.",1232755200,2,258,4.0
2505555,5,B000E6V07W,"This is a very good movie.  Don't expect to see Uncle Remus either.  He ain't here.  I'm as nostalgic as anyone, but I don't live in the past.  This is not a ""Gone with the Wind"" throwback with happy Negroes caring for the needs of White folks (nothing wrong with loving each other but this is 2009, those ""Driving Miss Daisy"" images should be put to rest.

That being said this is agreat family movie.  The voice characterizations are wonderful and the animation is very good.  This movie is funny, witty, and intelligent.  Brer Rabbit is still Brer Rabbit and he gets taught some well deserved lessons along the way.

One review said this was a vain attempt to make a ""POLITICALLY CORRECT"" version of an old ""classic.""  I doubt the writers even had that in mind.  This is just a good, funny cartoon with excellent African-American voice characterizations.  Ignore the ignorant and negative reviews.  I highly reccomend this movie.",1231459200,6,932,4.75
2505556,5,B000E6V07W,It is exactly what it is a DVD of THE ADVENTURES OF BRER RABBIT every house with little ones should have a copy.,1225497600,3,112,3.9130434782608696
2505557,2,B000E6V07W,"In light of all the controversy surrounding Disney's ""Song of the South"", this version of Uncle Remus tales only deepens the controversy.  As far as pleasing legal experts who get tense around civil rights issues, this movie is tremendous - as far as artistic expression, it's plain awful.  As one reviewer noticed, the animation is decent; but the story and character development are horrendous - to plop a child in front of this garbage would be detrimental to their developmental growth.

On the other hand you have Disney's work of art locked up somewhere because it hints at the days of Southern utopia between Master and Servant.  I understand this can be offensive, but this was not the aim of the Disney company, only an inevitable subtlety that must be conveyed in order to tell the story.  Someone who would be convinced of bringing back the ""glory days of the south"" after watching this movie clearly missed the point of the film - and probably needs psychologcial evaluation.

Finally I want to point out that this film's ""decent animation"" was a product of some Asian country.  That is, this culturally American film could not be animated by it's countrymen because of the expense.  So the guys at Universal used the money that should have been put into production to pay for the name recognition of the voice ""talents"".  I only hope this isn't evidence of where art is headed in this country.",1205107200,17,1406,4.776859504132231
