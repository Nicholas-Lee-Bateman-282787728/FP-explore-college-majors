8617672,3,B00FPNQI8A,"This show is ok. My 2-year-old doesn't seem to be taking to it, but I might try again when he is older. I think the idea is cute, but it does bother me that Mike talks with a whiney drawl. Also, the show tries to teach kids little lessons, but the lesson isn't understood until the very end. So, for the first 3/4 of the show, Mike or other characters are exhibiting behavior I don't really want my kid imitating. I wish the characters would learn their lessons earlier or just have nice, fun adventures without being quarrelsome, pouty, selfish, or whatever the case may be.",1426032000,,575,4.433962264150943
