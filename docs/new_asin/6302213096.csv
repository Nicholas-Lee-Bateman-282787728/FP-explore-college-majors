For the genre of movie it is I was delighted to find a bit of well played comedy, and a romantic storyline that happily replaced the seedier side of the film (mainly due to the fact that Korman did so well that he stole the whole show). Not only did I receive exactly what I had ordered, and in the shape it was said to be in, and much more quickly than promised, but I also finally had the chance to see the very first thing the then young Korman ever did on film professionally. I am very glad I found MY (copy of) Living Venus!! I am happy all around!! Thank you.",1412208000,,600,4.093220338983051
