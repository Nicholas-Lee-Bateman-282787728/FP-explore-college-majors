5998214,4,B00FKTCXGA,"I'm an advanced exerciser and have about 300 or so workout DVDs in my collection.  My problem area is always my lower half (thanks, Italian genes!), so I'm always on the lookout for glute-focused workouts.  A friend had mentioned that she purchased this and had been having nice muscle soreness (DOMS), so I decided to get it.  I've only done a few of the workouts, but I really like it so far!

The DVD comes with six workouts:

*  Tone-Up -- 12 minutes -- squats, lunges, and bridge work

*  Booty Booster -- 10 minutes -- cardio focus, includes some ab and arm work

*  Firm Extreme -- 9 minutes -- ballet-inspired moves

*  Fat-Burning Cardio -- 10 minutes -- cardio that focuses on moves that work the lower half

*  Booty Yoga -- 10 minutes -- yoga-focused moves

*  Dance Fit Buns -- 10 minutes -- dance workout

The DVD comes with a rotation calendar.  The idea is that the first two weeks, you do one workout a day; the third week, you do two workouts a day; and the fourth week, you do three workouts a day.  Each week also has one or two rest days.  Since these are so short, my plan is to follow the rotation schedule, and do these workouts as add-ons, before I do my main workout  for the day.

To do the workouts, you'll need:

*  a mat
*  a pair of light handweights
*  a chair

The design of the DVD menu is also great.  When you put it in, you can choose which individual segment you want, or you can go to the 30-day plan, and it will play the workout(s) scheduled for that day.

The backdrop of this is also beautiful and motivating.  It's filmed next to an infinity pool with the ocean in the background, and is lovely to look at.

The two instructors take turns leading the workouts (there is only one instructor for each one, with no background exercisers), and they are good instructions, although a bit unpolished.  (For instance, they aren't as smooth with their transitions between exercises and stumble a bit on some words, as if not completely rehearsed.)  Despite that, I like them both.  I had heard of Alicia Marie since she used to write a monthly column for _Oxygen_ magazine, but haven't heard of Courtney Prather before.

Also, if you want to try this out before purchasing it, all of the workouts are available on You Tube.  I ended up buying it for the convenience of being able to play it on the DVD player in my workout room.

I will be sure to update my review after I use this more, but, so far, it's a nice way to get in some extra glute work if you don't want to commit to a longer program like Brazil Butt Lift.",1388880000,112,2555,4.280922431865828
5998215,5,B00FKTCXGA,"Love these workouts! Before you buy check it out on YouTube. Just search ""30 Day Butt Lift,"" and you're ready to go. All the same videos for free!",1388793600,209,146,4.25
5998216,5,B00FKTCXGA,"I just received this dvd and have been using it for about a week. I feel sore in a good way in places that tell me its working. The trainers are good, one slightly irritating but its only for 10 minutes and she is just trying to be positive. The moves are doable but really work your muscles and because its 10minutes you keep telling yourself its almost over I can do this. I really like this dvd and would recommend it to others.",1388620800,16,431,4.142857142857143
5998217,5,B00FKTCXGA,I love this DVD!! The workouts are super easy and I can already tell that it's working.  A must buy for every woman wanting an easy and quick workout.,1388448000,8,150,4.172413793103448
5998218,5,B00FKTCXGA,"Love these workouts. I've only done it for a week but I feel sore like crazy. Both instructors have a good, positive energy and the background is pretty nice/not distracting. The way it's broken up into separate workouts that range from 9 min to 12 min, works perfect. The exercises aren't overly difficult but still very challenging. I'm an intermediate exerciser but did have some trouble at first with some repetitions. Overall it's not that expensive and also includes a 30 day breakdown of which segment to do as part of the '30 day butt lift.'

I am doing one segment a day along with running, Jeanette Jenkins Cardio Kickboxing, and Jillian Michaels Tone Your Trouble Zones, and Zumba. Trying to drop two pant sizes and about 15 lbs doing this along with Herbalife. I definitely recommend this to those who want their booty to feel/look lifted...working In an office all day has not been good to mine.",1387065600,30,908,4.746835443037975
5998219,5,B00FKTCXGA,Love all the quick workouts. Good for a busy mom like myself.,1493856000,,61,4.166666666666667

5998221,4,B00FKTCXGA,I absolutely love these work outs I do 1 of these work outs a day. I have been doing them for a month now I feel I have gotten stronger on my lower half. I do have more but than what I started off with. Nothing like Kim K but I was flat before now I have some definition. That was just 30 days. It's not a miracle by anyone's standards but it does work requires patience,1489795200,,370,3.8181818181818183
5998222,5,B00FKTCXGA,I just started this DVD 3 days ago and so far it's been awesome! Your glutes ache the next day for sure! I like that they have hard cardio and easier yoga days.,1489536000,,160,3.878787878787879
5998223,1,B00FKTCXGA,"Boring! NOt motivating at all. And, it hurts your knees if you're not somewhat in shape. I thought I was in shape enough, but it did hurt my knees",1485907200,,146,4.068965517241379

5998225,1,B00FKTCXGA,Hardly a workout.  This seems more like a trailer promo for their on line subscription workouts.  Total waste of money.,1485734400,,119,4.9
5998226,5,B00FKTCXGA,"It was great. After just one work out I was pumped and excited for the next day. Really well made. Really well organized also, how they did the video. It made me sore. I would suggest it to anyone",1484956800,,196,4.051282051282051

5998230,5,B00FKTCXGA,"After doing it for about 2-1/2 weeks without telling my boyfriend, he actually asked me ""Did your butt get bigger?"" (and loved it). The workouts are short enough to be quick but effective addition each day to the end of my regular workouts.",1476921600,3,240,4.604651162790698
5998231,5,B00FKTCXGA,A purchase I'm glad I made. I haven't felt better,1475193600,,49,4.0
5998232,4,B00FKTCXGA,Simple and clear instructions. Also like the short sections that you can mix and match.,1474761600,,87,4.866666666666666

5998235,2,B00FKTCXGA,Kind of weird but u got this for my wife and after 2 weeks I think a saw a difference in her booty but she said it was really repetitive and didn't keep things interesting enough to motivate her. She did say it mad her really sore tho.,1472169600,,235,3.9166666666666665
5998236,5,B00FKTCXGA,Great dvd 30 worth it,1468454400,,21,3.4
5998237,2,B00FKTCXGA,I purchased this just as an added bonus to two other workouts I do per day. I was kinda disappointed. First off they aren't long enough to really tone anything and each exercise only does several reps...you really should do atleast 10-15 reps each and then repeat and there is no repeating on any of them. I didn't find this as a challenge what so ever. This is probably more for beginners. If your advanced like I am I would do what I did and starting from the first day do atleast 2 of the workouts and hope you feel the soreness the day after and also use ankle weights.,1467331200,2,573,4.218181818181818
5998238,5,B00FKTCXGA,"Love this.  I love the backgrounds, makes me sense I am outside, near the ocean! I would buy more workout DVD's  when done outside.  These are very good for a 10 min workouts, really feel the burn.",1467072000,,197,4.27027027027027

5998242,5,B00FKTCXGA,I did it for 3 weeks and felt a huge difference. It is just a few workouts though that they eventually double and triple up. But great for the price and effectiveness. You eventually remember the moves and can do a few if you don't have dvd with you.,1459382400,,250,4.122448979591836
5998243,5,B00FKTCXGA,I bought it for my wife to get ready for beach weather. I watched it the work out video and started  doing them with her. I actually helped my low back pain. Just go slow.,1459209600,,171,3.8857142857142857
5998244,5,B00FKTCXGA,I really like these girls! They're not annoying like some other girls from these videos. Also it has a program to follow everyday and slowly builds to an extended workout. I have been doing this 2-3x a week for 2 months with other cardio workouts and my boyfriend has definitely noticed my butt filling out my jeans better. Very satisfied you will feel these workouts even just 10 minutes,1459036800,,388,4.63768115942029
5998245,4,B00FKTCXGA,Pretty easy to follow. Doesn't take much time at all,1458259200,,52,4.3

5998247,4,B00FKTCXGA,I only did the first day of this DVD and already my buns and thighs are feeling it! I never exercise and this just jumps right into it so it was a killer! I really like that it comes with a 30 day schedule/routine so I know what to do each day. Hoping this works!,1455148800,,263,3.8

5998251,5,B00FKTCXGA,"Holy butt workout. I liked this video a lot. I bought it because of previous reviews that were listed, and it was cheap. I was not dissapointed. There are 6 workouts that are about 10-12 minutes each, or you can do them all if you have the time. They all work different parts of your bum, and are all excellent. It is designed to lift your butt in 30 days. I love it so far. I used to do buns of steel back in the 90's, and this is just as good of a workout. You defiantly feel it after.",1449792000,3,487,3.88

5998253,5,B00FKTCXGA,"Before you purchase this product, check it out on youtube.  All the videos are on there for free plus extras.  You can also download the calendar online.  I've been using a chromecast to play it on the tv from my iPad.

This is a great SUPPLEMENT to a regular workout.  I have been using it in addition to my normal 30 minute regimen so I'm already warmed up when I turn it on and it adds a 10 minute butt segment each day.  If you are looking for an All-In-One system this is not for you.  They do not include a warm up/cool down or stretching, which I actually appreciate as it adds to the customizability of my routine (you wouldn't want to do a warm up and cool down for every video you do back to back).

For my needs, it is perfect.",1442966400,2,738,4.076388888888889

5998255,5,B00FKTCXGA,"I love this DVD. It is so simple to do and they slow it down so you can understand it. I've done the Brazil butt lift and it was too hard for me, I would get frustrated and quit when the moves were too fast and hard to follow. But these simple 10 minute workouts never leave me feeling like I didn't work out, but it's east to keep going all the way to the end!",1438387200,4,361,3.763157894736842
5998256,3,B00FKTCXGA,"The workouts ate really great, but after the 7th day they just start to repay the same 10 minute clips over and over again. The first day I did the workout, I only did the 10 minute epitome once and was sore the next day. At the end of a week I saw results, but got bored with the videos and got to where they weren't as effective anymore even when I did the routine 2 and 3 times in a row. Overall, not so bad.",1436832000,,411,3.7906976744186047

5998264,4,B00FKTCXGA,"I liked all of the workouts on this dvd except Dance Fit Buns. That one isn't safe. If you want to see results you need to use ankle weights  - more than they recommend. And I needed to do 3 segments to get a workout because 10 minutes is not enough. I bought this instead of Brazil Butt lift, but it didn't compare. I did see some results in a short amount of time with the modifications I used. The instructors were good especially Angie. Also, I have issues with my foot. This didn't bother it because there is not a lot of jumping. I can see me using this dvd for my lower body instead of some of the others I have on my shelf.",1431820800,3,631,4.007936507936508

5998268,3,B00FKTCXGA,"This is a pretty good workout but I didn't enjoy nearly as much as 10 minute solution Butt. It was a little dull in spots and considering I own a ton of lower body dvd's,there was nothing unique about it. I've done better and I've also done worse.

5998298,4,B00FKTCXGA,"I tried this out on you tube and did it for awhile and liked it, cause I was seeing results,  but since its easier for me to use a dvd on rushed mornings I bought the dvd. The reason im not giving it 5 stars is that on you tube there are more workouts; all are not included with this dvd. However this system really works. I have tried countless ""butt"" workouts and have enough dvds to start my own library but none have given results like this one. One thing ive learned over the years just because you ""feel"" it doesn't mean its going to do a darn thing for you. The mirror is the true test as to a products effectiveness. all the workouts are doable, and except for the one hit included on this dvd (there are more cardio on you tube) your not putting in a huge effort. But like I said I look in the mirror and actually start to see results, unlike the countless other systems ive used. So I guess its how one works out rather than how hard. Id like to see Befit do more with this like a 30 days and after, cause obviously you have to keep working your butt beyond 30 days. And im rather tired of wasting my time with stuff that doesn't work. also this system doesn't go into lifestyle, or what other exercises such as cardio one should be doing. or how to maintain, and even improve the work done in the 30 days .",1415059200,6,1317,4.084942084942085
5998299,5,B00FKTCXGA,"I love that this cd includes a plan and schedule to motivate you to do all 30 days.  The work outs do repeat, but do not get boring.  The location is beautiful!  For days 1-14, the work outs are 8-11 minutes long for each day. Then days 15-26 have 2 workouts scheduled for each day.  Days 25-30 bump it up to 3 workouts each day, which are about 30 minutes all together.  Most of the days are moderate.  The cardio one is a challenge.  I really felt stronger and like the video improved my backside, as it was supposed to by the end of the 30 days.  I'd love to have one of these for abs too!",1414454400,5,592,4.0

My first workout on this dvd: I only made it through 8 minutes out of 12. The next day I had pulled muscles in my lower back, hips, butt, and thighs. Not to the point that I couldn't walk or continue with the workouts, but I felt it for a few days. This is one of the few workouts where you notice results within a few days, physically.

There's something about putting one leg behind me with my foot on a chair--and squatting with the other leg--that I just can't seem to master.

5998329,4,B00FKTCXGA,"I bought this DVD not because I was particularly concerned with lifting my butt, but because I wanted to take off a month from running (for my knees' sake) and concentrate on full-body toning.  I am now nearly at the end of my 30 days, and I have been largely satisfied with my purchase.  Although there's obviously a booty emphasis here, these routines work the whole body; there's even a cardio routine.  The moves are simple but not easy--in other words, even an uncoordinated person like me can pick them up quickly, but I definitely feel the burn.  I like the novelty of having a new combination of exercises each day, and I like being able to pack my daily workout into 10-30 minutes in the morning.  The instructors are cheerful and funny, but I wish they wouldn't talk so much in between moves!  I know I have the option to mute the commentary and work out with the music only, and I have been availing myself of that option recently, but there's still a lot of dead time while the instructor is explaining the next move.  That's a minor complaint, however.  I highly recommend this DVD.",1395878400,5,1095,4.522842639593908

5998333,5,B00FKTCXGA,I bought this at Costco and was actually pleasantly surprised at how great this DVD is. It has a great mix-up of different workouts that really are great to add on to your routine to tighten and lift that booty up. Glad I bought it,1394323200,,231,4.155555555555556
5998334,5,B00FKTCXGA,"I've been using this system for a few weeks, it really works. I exercise regularly but needed to tone my lower body. After the first two workouts I realized that I needed a bit more of a challenge, so I modified the plan and began at week 3. The 30 day plan was extremely helpful as a guideline and especially so later when you begin combining the workouts. The Fat Burning Cardio is really a challenge. Every one of the exercises in these workouts are very effective for toning and tightening all the muscles in the legs and booty.

The instructors are motivational, Courtney isn't great at giving cues and she seems to provide most of the workouts on this DVD. I love that you can do these in just 10 minutes, however, once you progress it does take 20-30 minutes to get through since you'll be doing two-three of the routines back to back. After a couple of weeks I began to notice that it was working. I'd recommend this video highly to anyone.

UPDATE: I've been through the series once, have a bit more work to do so I am going through weeks 3-5 again adding a second rep to each of the workouts.",1393977600,27,1102,4.344660194174757
5998335,4,B00FKTCXGA,"This is a pretty effective DVD. The format of the program is great. Some of the exercises are a bit difficult to do in a small living room (They require 360 degree movement). Also, Alicia is obviously an excellent and experienced instructor, but Courtney comes across as somewhat inexperienced. In many of the exercises, she doesn't mention important technique information (such as ""flex"" or ""point"" your foot) until midway through the exercise or even on the second side. Also, she will often say ""one more"" and then do five more, or say ""three more"" and do one. None of this is a big deal, obviously, but it can be a bit irritating.",1393804800,2,634,4.669642857142857

Each workout is about 10 minutes, and you can select the ones you want, in the order you want, and end up with a customized workout up to 60 minutes long.  Or just do one 10 minute workout and move on to other forms of exercise.  I found the moves easy to follow and the women were strictly business--no chatter.  The sets varied, some indoors and some on the beach--all nice backdrops to make staring at the screen more pleasant.  You'll need shoes as well as weights and a chair for some of the workouts.
