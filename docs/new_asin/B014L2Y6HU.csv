8731217,2,B014L2Y6HU,"Marie Windsor was killer in The Narrow Margin, a true film noir classic.  Shes over the top bad, bad, bad in The Killing opposite Elisha Cook Jr. as well. I heartily recommend both films for your viewing pleasure.

This movie has none of the attributes of the noir genre - not in its characters, its plot, and least of all its cinematography. Its no more noir than a trip to the shopping mall.

What we have here is a second rate crime pic, set in sterilized, lily white California sunshine suburbia.  Its a formulaic whodunit, a drawing room mystery, but not very mysterious. Windsor plays a wretched, gold-digging witch who seems to take demented pleasure in screwing up other peoples lives. She gets herself shot - absolutely no big surprise, given that she leaves behind at least a half dozen people who had plenty of good reason to want her dead. The denouement is the tired old killer returns to the scene of the crime trope. But you probably won't really need to wait for the clumsy ending. If you haven't tumbled to the identity of the killer by the middle of the movie, you're one of the slower kids in the classroom.

Sure, Windsor is having a grand old time playing what one of the players calls a witch, no matter how you spell it. Other than that, there is less than zero to recommend this movie.

You want to see Windsor in a true film noir, make a large batch of popcorn, pop a beer, pull up a chair and watch a double feature: start with The Narrow Margin, finish with Kubricks great early film The Killing.

And don't waste any time on No Mans Woman. The title is an order of magnitude sexier than the rest of the movie. The movies a dud.",1522713600,,1655,4.388888888888889

8731219,4,B014L2Y6HU,"A routine Republic B-whodunit has no business looking this smashing or earning four stars, but this Olive Films transfer is mint and vault-quality, doing full justice to Bud Thackery's crisp, high-key monochrome cinematography and to Marie Windsor's makeup, hairdos, Adele Palmer costumes and refulgent figure. She rarely had a leading role this flamboyant, and if you appreciated her in NARROW MARGIN, THE KILLING or SWAMP WOMEN this will be a revelation.

Don Martin wrote the story with pulp scenarist John K. Butler, and Marie (then 35 years of age) plays a manipulative (Crawfordesque) golddigger, aged 29 and worldlywise, who simultaneously strings along a chemicals mogul, an art critic and a virile albacore fisherman, plus two or more of their fianc&eacute;es as well, blithely bollixing five lives through her cunning. Multitasking furiously, even busier (and less greasy) than Mildred Pierce, Marie's character blackmails, perjures, homewrecks and--get this--also runs a chic, lower Beverly Hills, art boutique. Windsor, as Emily Bertelsen crowned Miss Utah 1939 and trained for serious drama by Maria Ouspenskaya, knowingly finesses this pulpy material with a softer, more insidious touch than we associate with the ferocious Crawford, and this is one of Windsor's most confidently stylized performances (a noirish, witch/bitch badgirl infiltrating a daylit, upscale whodunit). Her strappy shoes (never budgeted for by Republic) on the fanciful DVD cover tell collectors exactly what to expect.

Despite the (lower) B.H. setting, Marie's courtyard boutique exteriors, surrounded by upscale jewelers, hatters(!) and haberdasheries, were filmed by Thackery on location in Westwood, and the more elaborate interiors (unusual for Republic) were designed by art director Walter Keller, who drew up the mogul's salon, a hunt-club cocktail bar and the art boutique in high-1955 style. The boutique is a tall ""Great Room,"" leading via (Hitchcockian) staircase to Marie's luxe boudoir, and the three stars Windsor, Archer and Knowles all take theatrical falls down the stairs to amortize Republic's ironworking costs. Watch for Percy Helton as the boutique caretaker, also Betty Garrett-lookalike Fern Hall as the marina telephonist. Watch even more closely: in the final sidewalk exteriors just preceding the reveal, a cloned Hitchcock lookalike, probably ptisserie-bound, waddles past Thackery's camera.

Republic producer Rudy Ralston (Vera Hruba's brother) also multitasked, simultaneously repurposing much of this talent (Fern Hall, costumer Adele Palmer, scenarist Don Martin) in a parallel production, also running exactly 70 minutes, DOUBLE JEOPARDY. The great Marie Windsor was released (to pursue her real passions painting and sculpting), but the parallel film has an even more cult-friendly second-tier cast in Rod Cameron, Gale Robbins, Allison Hayes, Robert Armstrong and Minerva Urecal.",1502928000,5,2904,5.780373831775701
8731220,3,B014L2Y6HU,"I've been on a ""film noir"" kick lately, and tried this one.  The writing was weak - quite subpar story.  It's not really a classic noir story, but rather a whodunnit - a clumsy one at that - with some character slumming.  Seen it before (the plot)? Yes. Many times? Many.  Other aspects of the film seem good - directing, acting, etc.",1457136000,2,334,4.338709677419355
