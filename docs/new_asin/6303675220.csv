700938,3,6303675220,"I agreed with Cassie/Pink but I agree strongly to Chibilute, I mean look at it, it's the same enemies (except for Ivan Ooze) but the special effects were okay, (compared to Turbo:A Power Ranger movie) but it was poor on plot  and sense, why the hell will an Ooze man want to enslave parents? and  Zordon said about old mystical Rangers, what happened to them? they  retaried? or what? if I was the creator of the Power Rangers saga, I'll  make a prequel, just like Star Wars.",929232000,,475,4.425287356321839
700939,5,6303675220,"This was a good movie. As a long time fan of Power Rangers, when this came out a few years ago, I loved it! And this year when my brother got hooked on Power Rangers I put what was left of what I remembered of the show and  rented this movie for him. Guess what. I still loved it! a good movie for  kids and old fans.",923270400,,317,3.716417910447761
701208,5,6303675220,"I got this movie when i was 4 years old and i still have it. Iam glad i saw the power ranger actors when i was 5 years old in 1999 in rock a fella plaza in new york city when i see this movie know a days it bring back so many memorys of the power ranger shows the knew power ranger shows know a days are not that great like mystic force and operation over drive they are okay but not better than the old power rangers i just hope they put back the old power rangers on jetix that would nice and iam sorry for the car accident death of the original yellow ranger thuy thang on the san francisco highway in 2001 i was real sad when i heard that but knew power ranger shows came out well their not knew any more but i saw them they where really great. Okay back to this movie, this movie was real good but why did this movie come after the shows power rangers first came out in 1993 this came out in 1995 oh well this movie was good.",1208044800,,930,3.8489583333333335
701209,5,6303675220,"This movie is very entertaining, mostly because the phoned-in performance of David Yost in the Billy Cranston role is so abysmal.  200 billion stars out of 5.",1116374400,4,158,4.851851851851852
701210,5,6303675220,This is a great movie. I was a fan when I was about four and I still am. I've watched the movie so mutch that I wore it out! So maybe this move isn't just for kids like everybody thinks.,1106352000,,186,3.675
701211,5,6303675220,"Plain and simple, this is an awesome movie for fans of the Power Rangers.  However, for people who don't like Power Rangers, this may be 1.5 hours of quite intense displeasure.  Fortunately for me, I like the Power Rangers, and this movie is one of my top ten favorites.  Seriously.  I'm not kidding.

In a nutshell, the world is in danger and it's up to the Power Rangers to save it.  I better not give away the ending.

Yes, it is cheesy.  Yes, it is for kids.

But for fans of the show, the special effects are unbelievable.  To go from a man in a bulky Zord suit to a CGI model for the NinjaMegaZord is unbelievable.  The individual Zord fights are fun, although my favorite part of the movie is the armor.  No spandex in this flick.  The Rangers are all wearing shiny, pretty armor with cool helmets and new weapons.  I found the fight scenes fun and exciting, and the soundtrack to this movie is decent.  It contains Red Hot Chili Peppers, Van Halen, and some other random crap that isn't as good.  But some of the songs are pretty good.

Dulcea is a nice touch.  She's much more fun (imo) than Ninjor (from the show), and she looks far better in a bikini.

In short, if you are a fan, you've probably already seen this movie.  If you aren't a fan, you probably won't be interested.  On the other hand, if you like special effects and martial arts-style fighting, you might get a kick out of it.  Just don't expect this to be a 5-star movie for you like it was for me if you aren't already a fan of the Power Rangers.",1091577600,51,1523,4.251748251748252
701212,5,6303675220,"Ok, I know they're like so many people who hate Power Rangers and thinks it's ONLY for kids. But I've seen almost all of teh seasons of the show and it's actually pretty good. Has some not-so-good moments sometimes but that's OK. I'm 15, and I still watch it. The movie, Oh it was one the movies that I absolutely found adorable. The actors are great, the special effects are great(considering it was in 1995!), the jokes I loved, especially Adam!!(""I'm a Frog..."" Awww!!) Ivan Ooze it funny and Rita and Zedd are even there! Which just adds to the jokes. I especially loved the zords and the new Command Center. Why didn't they just keep it like this through out the rest of the season?! This movie is great for the family, and if some people weren't so close-minded about these types of movies(or shows) they could lear to appreciate it at least, and not be so repuled by it. It's actually isn't that bad. BUY/RENT IT!",1038787200,51,920,4.482142857142857
701213,5,6303675220,"It may be a little cheesy to older viewers, but if you're like me, Power Rangers was your world when you were a kid. The action is fun, the effects are amazing, the actors are all VERY beautiful people, and its just general fun for the family. If you need a day to just escape, this movie is good to watch. Plus it has Kimberly(Amy Jo Johnson) who is VERY beautiful and the ONLY Pink Ranger worth watching. I stopped watching the series once she left, no other girl compares...",1023321600,6,477,4.311111111111111
701214,4,6303675220,"I used to watch the Power Rangers T.V show. Everybody that saw the show knows that it was really cheesy. But when I saw the movie at the theatre I was shocked. It didn't look that cheesy. It was like they were saving all of the money for when the movie came out. This movie was very entertaining. and it's funny too, if you really sit back and look at it. The way kimberly and Tommy kept calling eacch other's names. I was like, can you get off each other's jocks. Anyway this movie was suprisingly hype!",1019520000,,504,4.206185567010309
701305,5,6303675220,"Over the years we have watched the Power Rangers change from 6 kids that use to hang out in Angel Grove. Into the Turbo Rangers, Space Rangers, Lost Galaxy Rangers, Light Speed Rescue Rangers, and now the Time Force Rangers. Yet none of them compare to the original cast. I liked this movie for all the right reasons. It has the typical PR plot with a few twist, great costumes, special effects, and ranger skills. For anyone who liked the original Power Rangers to a parent that would like to show thier kids where it all started, This is the movie to buy.",988502400,4,557,4.41747572815534
701306,2,6303675220,"Lacking any intelligent dialogue or acting, this once-popular Fox Kids show made into a motion picture is substancially better the TV series, with OK special effects and some suitable comic relief. The plot is lacking any suspense and has barely enough interest to pique the interest of adults (the Rangers are played by young adults, considering the roles they play). The Power Rangers are played with lightheartedness, the roles not taken very seriously. But the plot, special effects, excellent costuming, and comic relief keep this from flopping as a remake of 1993-1995's popular childrens' show. Passable family viewing, considering its PG rating.",986688000,5,653,5.411764705882353
701307,5,6303675220,"Power up with six of the original incredible teens who out-maneuver but defeat evil everywhere as the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers! But in this adventure, the Rangers may have met their match when they face off one of the most sinister monsters of the galalxy-Ivan Ooze. Really awesome and action-packed, with awesome costumes, zords, and villains. This is really the power of all powers in the saga.",982627200,,400,4.985074626865671
701308,3,6303675220,"The first of two Power Rangers movies released in theatres, this was a pretty good movie.  Lots of fun, simple story and humor, with the characters you know and love (if you like the tv series).  Unfortunately, the movie is missing the original rangers, Jason, Zack and Trini, and the Megazord in this film looks nothing like any Megazord introduced before or after.  They should've just stuck with the original Japanese design for the robot instead of making a generic robot of their own.  But still, this is a good film to watch if you're a fan of the show.  However,if you can't stand the tv show and have no interest in the Power Rangers, then stay away from this film, as you'll probably end up criticizing it for all the things it is intended to be, a children's fantasy show.",976060800,4,782,4.5177304964539005
701309,4,6303675220,"As a single mother of a 7-year-old the viewability of programming aimed at children is a priority for me, and as a result, I spend most of her viewing time seated right beside her.  I'd always been a fan of The Power Rangers  series for their Crayola-colored costumes and the easy way their comradery  translated to their viewing audience.  Series casting changes  notwithstanding, when this movie made its way to video I purchased a copy  for our home viewing collection.  This one gets a grade B+ for the  delightful manner in which it uses grade school lessons to entertain young  children.  The soundtrack is pretty neat, too.",958435200,48,630,4.803738317757009
701310,2,6303675220,"Rita the Alien Witch and Lord Zed release an ancient evil that overtakes the world by marketing evil ooze at a small corner shop. Long ago I have seen snippets and parts of this film and it seemed intriguing. And, yes, if  you don't mind the characters, what is left of the film is quite enticing -  a primeval world, an ancient shrine, a run for an ancient weapon, that is  all fine and interesting, even semi-epic at times. But the characters, the  plot, the acting, and especially the script merge to create the perfect  dead film not dissimilar from Plan 9 from Outer Space, only with better  special effects. The special effects themselves are quite outdated, the  shapes having no skins attached, merely chrome-like colors. I enjoyed the  giant insects and the new Zords, but besides that, this film is nothing.",950918400,5,817,4.704225352112676
701311,3,6303675220,"A Power Rangers aficionado I appear to be, but this movie wherein they have to stop Paul Freeman from a toxic invasion is a little too drafty, except for the end sequence. I'd rather just stick with the once popular TV  show.",947030400,2,225,4.357142857142857
701312,5,6303675220,"It didn't do well in the box office simply because it had the words ""Power Rangers"" in it.  The show is better than what people like to think, IMHO.  Despite the splicing mistakes, the effects, look, acting,  and script were great.  It DID look like a movie and not a TV show.  Whether you're a kid, an adult, or in high school, I reccomend this movie.",943056000,,352,4.2727272727272725
701313,4,6303675220,"I saw this movie in the theater way back in 1995, and it kept me on the edge of my seat. The effects were a HUMUNGOUS imrprovement and helps the story along nicely. It had good writing, especially for the deliciously  over the top Freeman. I must admit though, that some of the jokes were  kinda corny, and that the movie itself was more dramatic than the show. Me  being 15, I still watch this movie from time to time, because It's just a  plain fun, feel-good action/fantasy flick. I think that the next movie  should go back to the original rangers instead of these new wanna-bes. I  still love this movie!!!",934934400,6,611,4.410714285714286

So ranger fans, if you are bored with the new series out there and want to travel back in time, go for this item.  VHS or DVD will not matter.
