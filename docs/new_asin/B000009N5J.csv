And read . . . .  in 1972 THE BIG BOSS came out in Hong Kong.  It was released in the US later as FISTS OF FURY (notice the ""s"" on the end of ""FISTS"").  In 1973, THE CHINESE CONNECTION was released in Hong Kong.  Same director and leading actress as Big Boss.  It was released as FIST OF FURY in the United states (notice, no ""s"" on the end of ""FIST"").  Therefore, if you want a cheaper version of this film, get FISTS OF FURY--same movie as BIG BOSS.  Make sure there is an S on the end of FIST.  Otherwise you will get the CHINESE CONNECTION.
  I've also seen the CHINESE CONNECTION confused with RETURN OF THE DRAGON that was originally released as WAY OF THE DRAGON.  Ugh!  Luckily, Return of the Dragon is a standard title now.  Those described above, however, will trick you--even when buying Amazon videos.  Be careful--look for the date of release and read the reviews CAREFULLY!",978048000,3,1006,4.345945945945946
