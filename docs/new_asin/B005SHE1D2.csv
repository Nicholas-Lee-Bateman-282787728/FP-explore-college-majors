His work includes Bastard Swordsman series,Master,Crazy Horse Intelligent Monkey,Lady Assassin,Lovers Blades. The film's main stars are Michelle Mai Suet,Yuen Tak,Chen Kuan Tai,Austin Wai Tin Chi,Chu Tiet Wo.

  Michelle Mai plays a spoiled rich girl who is set up to be married and falls for a Swordman played by Chen Kuan Tai. She is then set up by other thieves and killers to trick her and take her wealth from her father. Yuen Tak plays the character ""Monkey"",that falls for Michelle.

  There is too much story and talking but the only saving grace is the action,which is choreographed by Tony Liu Jun Guk and Dang Tak Cheung. From swordplay to flying,running on walls like Bastard Swordsman, Secret Service. From watching the action you know you're in for another great Tony Liu movie. Austin Wai Tin from Gang Master and Incredible Kung Fu Master,Chu Tiet Wo from Eight Diagram Pole Fighter,play the villians. At the end is another good Wuxia from Tony Liu.",1330300800,,1040,4.914285714285715
