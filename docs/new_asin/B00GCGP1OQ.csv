8622169,1,B00GCGP1OQ,"The DVD I received is not of Come Spy with Me, but instead a ghastly 1989 movie called Deadly Spygames - one of the very worst I've had the misfortune to glimpse (I fast-forwarded through the 22 chapters).  Yes it did star a grey and elderly Troy Donahue and even Tippi Hedren whom I thought would have had more class than to appear in this trash, but the film is shot worse than the worst amateur productions and the print is straight from grainy VHS, and the acting is dire.

The DVD disk has Come Spy With Me printed onto it and I can't believe this is a mistake - more a scam.  Not the fault of Amazon of course, but clearly a breach of trade description and I've claimed a refund from them.  I would give no stars if I could, but one is the minimum.",1413072000,8,754,4.108843537414966
