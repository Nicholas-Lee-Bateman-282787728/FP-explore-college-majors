Operation 67

Operacion 67 (1967)

First of all, the audio is horrible and very difficult to hear, add to that, a very blurry and faded print.

Operacion 67 was directed both by Rene Cardona and his son Rene Cardona Jr. Rene Cardona Sr. was a director in the Golden Age of Mexican cinema. Rene Cardona Sr, who was an in-house Mexican Director, along with his son, did some 1970's Exploitation films that played the world theater circuits. Together they produced, directed and distributed numerous low-budget Exploitation films that weren't very good, but are noted for having burnt out Hollywood actors and exotic themes (Guyana: Crime of the Century (1979), Carlos the Terrorist (1979), Cyclone (1978), The Bermuda Triangle (1978), Tintorera! Tiger Shark (1977)).

Operacion 67 is choppy and lazily edited, and doesn't really follow through on any good dramatic storyline. The whole film is an attempt to kill Jorge Rubio (Jorge Rivero) and El Santo, who are special agents by day and luchadores (wrestlers) by night. The bad guys are so inept, but the fight scenes are idiotically fun. The bad guys try to kill them in rooms, the road, underwater, etc. They aren't able to do the job. It definitely has its silly charms.

It's filled with the staples of 1960's spy films, including 1960's bad men in 60's fedoras, 60's submachine gun, 60's helicopters, 60's babes, and 60's race cars. There's a criminal group, who want to flood the economy with counterfeit money. A few scenes of wrestling are included, with a bad body double filling in for Jorge Rubio (Jorge Rivero). Jorge Rivero is muscular and his obvious body double is not as chiseled. Also, there's two scenes of dummies being thrown out of a window to stimulate the real ejection of bad guys. It's a low budget affair, nonetheless, it's not completely horrible.

Jorge Rivero was a Mexican actor who appeared in a few American movies (The Last Hard Men (1976), Rio Lobo (1970), Soldier Blue (1970)). He was a weightlifter and starred in a few ""El Santo"" movies and plenty of low budget films like Manaos (1979), Pistoleros de la frontera (1967), Manaos (1979) and Evil Eye (1975). El Santo was a masked Mexican wrestler.

The luchador films were popular during the 1960's to the 1970's, also look for Demonio Azul (Blue Demon), Mil Mascaras, Tinieblas, and Rayo de Jalisco Sr.

Films: Superzam el Invencible 1971, Las Vampiras 1968, Mil Mscaras 1966, Santo vs. the Vampire Women 1962, Blue Demon contra el poder satanico 1964.

Nunca habia visto una pelicula de James Bond para poder notar las similitudes con ""Dr. No"", ""From Russia with Love"", ""Goldfinger"" y ""Thunderbolt"". En realidad ""Operacion 67"" es como un recopilado de las mejores sequencias de esos filmes en una trama de espionaje bastante simple y estelarizada por el legendario enmascarado de plata, el Santo y Jorge Rivero. De nio me fascino esta pelicula y la vi varias veces. Recientemente adquiri el DVD y aunque al igual que las ya mencionadas peliculas del agente 007, se nota bastante viejita, aun retiene el factor de diversion intacto. La accion es estupenda, las damas en ropas menores son hermosas, Jorge Rivero es creible en su papel, Noe Nurayama es un gran villano y los valores de produccion son sorprendentemente de superior calidad comparado con otros filmes del Santo que parecen haber sido filmados con muy escasos recursos y a la carrera. El DVD es de buena calidad: los colores son brillantes y el sonido es aceptable. Lo que pudieron haber hecho mejor es la caratula. Esperaba ver el poster original de la pelicula y no una foto de mera lucha libre que podria pasar facilmente ante los ojos de los no conocedores como un documental de lucha libre. He visto casi todas las peliculas de El Santo y esta, en mi opinion, es la mejor.",1330819200,,1368,4.704166666666667
