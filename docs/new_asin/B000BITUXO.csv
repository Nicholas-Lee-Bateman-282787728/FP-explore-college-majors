2419232,5,B000BITUXO,"Better known as the Barrymore on horseback, Richard Boone didn't play the role of Paladin - he was Paladin. If anyone other than Boone played the role, the series probably wouldn't have become a landmark. I have purchased the first two seaons and the quality was magnificent. Unlike a lot of people who post reviews on Amazon to gripe about picture and sound quality BEFORE they even buy the set, I am not like that.

Two things of interest you should keep in mind when you do buy this set. One, Boone wanted to do ""The Rivalry"" with Martin Gabel in NY on stage so the production for this season was speedy - they filmed the season's episodes in a much quicker rate than the former two.

Two, among the season's best episodes wrth watching first (in case you don't have time to watch them all): ""First Catch a Tiger"" with Harry Bartell and directed by Ida Lupino, which was heavily praised by TV GUIDE and reviewed by VARIETY ""Have Gun Will Travel started the new season with a twist in which Paladin, as the hunted, was hunting his hunter.""

""Episode in Laredo"" with Gene Lyons proving that a man who has to prove himself doesn't have to stand up to a small boy.

""Les Girls"" written by Gene Roddenberry has an inside joke.  All of the character's names, Yvonne, Annette, Cecile, etc. were the names of his family relatives!

""Shot by Request"" was actually filmed at the Melody Ranch and Howard Seay, the script writer, was in debt at the time so he used his connections to sell the producers a script.

""Fragile"" starred Werner Klemperer and directed by Andrew McLaglen and the two went to school together!  So this episode made a reteaming - not to mention the classic Hal Needham scene where he falls through the glass.

""The Golden Toad"" starred Lorna Thayer, who griped about never being allowed to be on GUNSMOKE because she was told she looked too much like Kitty, so she got a part in this episode.

""Tiger"" proved to be the first episode of the series for Richard Boone to begin taking control of the series by telling Don Taylor, the director, what he was and what he was NOT going to do for the scenes.

""Charlie Red Dog"" is a great episode.  That's all that needs to be said.

""The Naked Gun"" has Ken Curtis is what would be two episodes of him playing the character of Monk, years before he played Festus on GUNSMOKE.  Curtis would return as Monk in season four.

""Love of a Bad Woman"" stars Larry Dobkin who recalled how much fun he had sharing beers after filming, and how he and Boone became good friends afterwards.

""International Affair"" was the only episode in which Paladin never left the Hotel Carlton.

""The Search"" has a blooper in the episode.  Watch as the numbers on the hotel door keep switching!

How do I know all this trivia?  Actually, I know TONS of trivia but you can get it all by purchasing the HAVE GUN WILL TRAVEL COMPANION by Martin Grams and Les Rayburn, which is also available on Amazon.com.  Treat yourself by purchasing both season three and the book.  You won't be disappointed.",1132358400,18,3024,4.510091743119266
2419233,5,B000BITUXO,"Judging by the quality of the first two boxed sets for ""Have Gun Will Travel"", I have little doubt that this release will be every bit as satisfying in terms of packaging, content and film transfer quality.  It would be nice to see some added extras with this set, though.

Among the best episodes in the set are ""First, Catch a Tiger"", ""Episode in Laredo"" (first two of the season), ""The Unforgiven"" and ""Return to Fort Benjamin"".  The season wallows a bit in the middle but picks up steam once more with some finely crafted stories in the final 7-8 installments.  Many fans feel that the show more or less peaked with this season and began to wane in quality thereafter.  That's to be expected when you consider that 117 episodes were made over the first three years(!) I'm very pleased that sales for the first two seasons were strong enough to warrant another release for this excellent western series.

2419318,5,B000BITUXO,"I think Have Gun - Will Travel was the best TV western series of its era. The character of Paladin was unique among the many, many westerns that came and went during that period of the '50s and '60s. The show's format allowed a wide variety of well-written, different stories set in different locations, which kept it from becoming stale over its incredible seven seasons on TV. This DVD set seems well made and so far has not given me any problems during playback. The audio and video qualities are good.",1412553600,,505,4.56043956043956
2419319,4,B000BITUXO,"The series is well-made, often with thought-provoking story lines. Some of the details (such as clothing, hair styles, and makeup) are totally anachronistic, but they otherwise went the extra mile and provided enough location shots that you can suspend reality, sit back and enjoy some pretty good character acting (Not to mention great shoot-outs!).

The publisher decided to split later seasons into multiple ""Volumes"" in an obvious grab for more profit, but the earlier seasons such as this one are good value for the price.",1410480000,,527,5.2

I appreciate Richard Boone's acting much more, I understand many of his classic quotes that were lost to me when I was a boy.

2419353,5,B000BITUXO,"Rawhide, Wanted Dead or Alive, The Rifleman, and HGWT are some really great western tv shows from the bygone era of the fifties and sixties. Jeez, I said bygone. Am I really that old? Yes!

HGWT ramped the plot up quick and finished even faster for nice little 25 minute show. It always featured great stars that weren't stars quite yet. Charles Bronson I believe apppeared twice, and many many more. I find myself waiting til the credits role to see who that actor was that I've seen so often.

Boone played a great character as Paladin. As a youngster, I always wanted the Paladin holster and gun with the horse chess piece trademark embossed on it.  He was a San francisco socialite that could hire his services out as a gun fighter in the tough towns. He solved the myteries and evil doings with his mind most of the time. He only resorted to the fast draw as an absolute last resort. OK, I really liked that though. He smiled a lot, and could also stare down the meanest character, while charming a beautiful lady in the next scene. Not the most handsome guy, but knew how to work the room.

I have the first three seasons and have hit a road block with the dreaded Season4 volume 1+2. I hate the volume marketing gimmick. Just gimme the whole season. Not sure if I'm going to play the volume game for season4-?

These sets are well done and the picture looks great. So get it already!",1272758400,3,1390,4.392996108949417
2419374,5,B000BITUXO,"I was at the library going through the DVDs and came across Have Gun Will Travel.  They only had 1 set.  I watched it that night and reserved all I could at the library.  Their DVDs had been used so much they skipped.  I just had to see every minute.  I  went on Amazon and checked the prices of seasons 1, 2, and 3 individually with the price of 3 seasons in one and it was cheaper to buy individually (like $16 cheaper.)  So I did.  It arrived quickly and in good shape.

The DVDs are of great quality, so crisp and clean and black and white.  The memories it brings back can't be measured.  I immediately started watching them,  It's like a drug!  I have to limit my watching. I'm now watching the 3rd season.  I wish they would come out with the 2nd half of 4th season and lower the price.  But money talks.

It is true-Richard Boone was not handsome, but he sure was sexy.  There's just something about him.  He became Paladin.  The acting is superb, the locations were gorgeous, especially Big Bear.

I also purchased the book by David Rothel (A Knight Without Honor in a Savage Land).  It's very interesting and helps you get to know Boone better.

If you remember Have Gun Will Travel, get the DVDs.  You won't be sorry.",1271289600,2,1228,4.2894736842105265

My video here is simply to show the box, the slipcover, the disks inside and give you an idea of what the dvd menu looks like and the title opening of each episode.  The stories are all excellent. Paladin, a former Army officer and West Point graduate hires his personal services as a fast gun out to those who are in desperate need and have no one else to turn to.  His typical fee is one thousand dollars and he expects to be paid whether he succeeds or not. Sometimes he asks for more , if the situation involves a lot of money, and sometimes he waives his fee completely and takes a case purely out of a sense of justice. Paladin is a very literate man ,very intelligent and often quotes Shakespeare or Keats or other romantic literary giants when he seeks to comment on some tragic situation or improbable circumstance for which other words won't do. He makes it very clear to those who seek his help that he is not a bounty hunter nor a paid assassin and rejects people who want him to engage in such endeavors. He is very fast on the draw with his specially crafted revolver, though he only uses it as a last resort, preferring to resolve matters by less violent means when he can. He doesn't always resolve matters satisfactorily, in fact several times the situations he gets involved in end up in tragedy, which lends an air of realism to the series. Men , women, and even children seek his help and he weighs each person's situation carefully before deciding whether he will get involved. He is the Equalizer of the old west, a hero for hire to those who desperately need one.  Sometimes very strange circumstances present themslves. As in one episode called ""Never Help The Devil"" in which a murderous gunman has been terrorizing a town. Everyone is frightened of him. In one scene he provokes a gunfight with a local man and kills him, but is badly injured in the process.  The townfolk sensing that the killer is weakened begin to gather around him and the gunman retreats into the town's hotel.  He then offers to buy Paladin's services to help him escape the town as the mob outside grows bigger and bolder. Paladin completely despises the thought of helping the man escape from the rightful anger and outrage of the townspeople. But in this episode we see Paladin's internal dilemma as he struggles with his own principles. The people of the town deserve justice, but Paladin isn't sure what justice is in this case.  Ultimately he decides that he can't stand by and let a helpless man be killed by an angry mob, no matter how much he deserves it, and agrees to help the man escape but only as Paladin's prisoner.  Paladin tells him he will turn him over to the sheriff in the next town.  In a tragic twist , justice occurs before they reach the next town. I won't spoil the ending. I recommend the entire series , all of the first three seasons on DVD.  The only disappointment is that seasons 4, 5, and 6 have not been released yet. Some people have complained that the DVD disks they received are physically flawed or deteriorated in some way but I have not encountered that situation at all. I purchased the set direct from Amazon and all the disks in the set worked perfectly.

One caution, there seems to be some quality control issues with this release. There are several reviews reporting problems with the disks of this set. I decided to place it safe and  bought it ""New"" for 8 dollars from Amazon Fulfillment. I do see what looks like finger prints or stains on the surface of some of the discs. These blemishes only caused a play back problem on one disk, and responded to the wiping the disc radially with facial tissue and spit (you can use windex or the gentle cleaner of your choice).
So, don't miss this set because there have been problems, but be prepared to have to return them once or twice if you get bad ones. Just remember to check the discs when you get them so you can them back if you have to. Amazon will work with you on this, and they pay the shipping both ways.",1198972800,,994,4.315508021390374
2419388,1,B000BITUXO,"Have Gun Will Travel is a great show which I would highly recommend to anyone interested in TV Westerns, but be aware that customers are having serious problems with one particular batch of sets of Have Gun Will Travel: The Complete Third Season being offered by Amazon at an extremely attractive price which seems too good to be true (with the Amazon Standard Identification Number of ASIN: B000BJS4GW). I want to emphasize that it seems to be just this one particular batch of Season 3 sets which are exhibiting these problems (there is another batch of Season 3 sets offered at a higher price on Amazon, which have had no problems reported).

Six of the seven discs in these sets are apparently experiencing some type of DVD rot (discs are cloudy, dulled, and mottled) from contact with the defective slimcases in which they were housed.

Apparently what has happened is that there has been a chemical reaction to the shiny surface of the six DVDs from contact with the oily plastic in these three slimcases and this has caused the problem.

As a result some of the discs will not load at all (problems with Discs 1, 2, and 6 have been reported) and the DVD player will show ""No Disc"" or lock up. There have also been problems reported with one episode on Disc 7, ""The Trial.""

In my case, Amazon quickly sent out a replacement set to replace the defective one I had received, but it was unfortunately also defective.

When I contacted Amazon's customer service, they indicated that they were aware that there were ""widespread"" problems with these sets and so could not send an additional replacement but would offer a refund: ""I'm sorry to hear that you experienced the same problem with your replacement shipment. As it seems that the problem with this item ""Have Gun - Will Travel - The Complete Third Season"" is more widespread than we originally thought, we are not able to send another replacement. We will gladly refund you in full for the return of this item.""

Other Amazon customers are having similar problems with the sets they are receiving and with the replacements.

2419389,5,B000BITUXO,"I purchased the first three seasons of Have Gun - Will Travel for my father over the past three Christmases and they have proven to be a great item that we both enjoy. He's a western fan that's never had a lot of use for modern television (when I was a child, I remember how he only fixed our antenna that had blown out of whack several months earlier when the Royals made the World Series), while I'm a long-time TV nut that collects series on DVD. This show has brought us together under the banner of Paladin. The sets themselves are simple, but very well put together. They're short on extras, but that's quite OK because the program content is large and it's just great to have a classic like this available while even networks like TV Land seem to be ignoring classic programming from the fifties and sixties in favor of 80's nostalgia. Also notable, is that Paramount was releasing this show the right way: all 39 half-hour episodes in one package for a reasonable price. I very much hope that Paramount reverses it's decision to not release the last three seasons.",1192147200,,1072,4.530927835051546

2419417,4,B000BITUXO,"The third season of HAVE GUN was undoubtedly the worst of the series, though argued by hard-core fans as being the second worst season of the series behind the sixth season.  The production was hurried on account of Boone's insistence that he star in the stage production of Norman Corwin's ""The Rivalry"" with Martin Gable.

Since most people buy a season but don't make it through all of the discs, here are the best of the season:

FIRST, CATCH A TIGER  (September 12, 1959)  Season opener directed by Ida Lupino.

EPISODE IN LAREDO  (September 19, 1959)  Great character study of a hired gun, and Paladin's job to take care of him within the sights of his own son.

LES GIRLS  (September 26, 1959)  Silly premise written by Gene Roddenberry (yes, Roddenberry of Star Trek fame) but the names of al the fictional characters in this episode are named after Roddenberry's family members and sisters.

SHOT BY REQUEST  (October 10, 1959)  Based on a story by Howard Seay who was desperate for money and sold the story idea to the producers.  John Abbott's best performance.

FRAGILE  (October 31, 1959)  Avoid thsi episode - it's the worst.

THE UNFORGIVEN  (November 7, 1959)  David White gets a bed role, which is sad for a man of his talents but the script it top notch.  One of the best of the season.

THE NAKED GUN  (December 19, 1959)  Ken Curtis plays the role of Monk, a character that will make a return in a fourth-season episode.  This was the same professional singer Curtis who would later play Festus on GUNSMOKE.

CHARLEY RED DOG  (December 12, 1959)  Great story and Scott Marlowe helps make this one of the best of the season.

THE LEDGE  (February 13, 1960)  One of the most macabre and satisfying episodes of the series.

LOVE OF A BAD WOMAN  (March 26, 1960)  A great story with Larry Dobkin returning for a role.  Dobkin and Boone were good friends and the story is great.

INTERNATIONAL AFFAIR  (April 2, 1960)  The ONLY episode to NEVER take place outside of the Hotel Carlton.  The whole story was filmed on sets so obviously Hey Boy gets to do some true comic efforts.

NEVER HELP THE DEVIL  (April 16, 1960)  Superb episode opener in the Cresecnt City General Store, rest of the episode isn't worth watching.

THE TWINS  (May 21, 1960)  Worth watching just to see a twist on the Cain and Abel story.

The behind-the-scenes trivia that is included with the episodes on the DVDs isn't worth a darn.  Very little trivia at all.  Telling me that Gene Roddenberry created Star Trek isn't trivia to me.  I do recommend when you buy this set or future HGWT sets, you buy the HAVE GUN WILL TRAVEL COMPANION book by Martin Grams and Les Rayburn.  That book tells you who got shot accidentally on the set, who got drunk, which episodes were filmed in 1 day instead of 3, how to spot Hal Needham as a stuntman, where the episodes were filmed, which episodes have Richard Boone's son in the cast, lots of background material that is worth reading before or after each episode.  The book is available on Amazon.com so I believe buying both would entitle you to free postage.  Recommended.  Season Four is an improvement, do grab that when it comes out.",1154995200,16,3165,4.587073608617594

2419420,5,B000BITUXO,"Like Clint Eastwood and James Garner who both followed, Wire Paladin was a true Californian Ubermensch - only more so. A man equally comfortable identifying the tree under which a specific French wine's grapes were grown in a blindfolded taste test as he is scrambling with an Indian in a fight to the death.  As his promiscuous bedding of women would seem to indicate, Paladin's DNA has come down to us in myriad forms:  even Columbo and Fred Sanford can claim some shared ancestry, although we can be sure grapes weren't involved in the fabrication of Fred's Champipple.

Regardless of Boone's historical significance, however, these shows are gems.  The little touches are wonderful: Boone yelling when he gets hit, Hey Boy absently putting a coin in his ear for no apparent reason, and Boone's cape which he uses both when duelling with James Coburn, and when escorting hot chicks to the opera.

This third season may not be quite as strong as the first two, but it's still a solid five stars in my book.",1143244800,,1008,4.7371428571428575
2419421,5,B000BITUXO,"Have Gun - Will Travel was an adult western staple of the late 50's - early 60's. Paladin is both a complex and enigmatic gunfighter based in San Francisco played with intense quiet gusto by Richard Boone. Paladin [like Hopalong Cassidy for the kids] is a hero all dressed in black. This is the 3rd season of a 7 season run for the show and one only hopes the other 4 season will follow. Paladin attempts to solve as many problems with reason rather than the gun, but that in no way lessens his proficiency with a weapon when needed. The quality of soon to be or already famous guest stars is high. The writing is first class. For those who watched this show when it first aired, these DVDs are a treasure. For viewers who are seeing the show for the first time, this is an excellent look at the issues of half a century ago being dealt with in an entertaining manner. And, of course, there is that famous theme song [sung by the boys in the film STAND BY ME] about the Knight Without Armor in a Savage Land that plays over the end credits of each episode.",1142467200,9,1056,4.258706467661692

2419434,5,B000BITUXO,Have Gun Will Travel was the best western in the history of TV and one of the best shows in all TV history. The writing is crisp and insightful with outstanding acting and directing. Writers like Gene Coon and Gene Roddenberry and directors like Ida Lupino and Andrew McLaughlin made this a standout of the 1950's.  This season has more great episodes than the first two (although they are also superior). The only flaw is occasional melodramatic overacting (ironically the episodes directed by Boone are some of the worst offenders).,1141171200,8,534,4.933333333333334

In each episode it seems as if an hour of action is packed into a 30 minute program. It's hard to believe this television show is really from the late 50's. The stories hold up very well even today, and the same life lessons apply as well. I strongly recommend this 3rd season of ""the man in black"" if you enjoyed the previous two.

2419439,4,B000BITUXO,"Although I was only a few months old when this series went off the air, when I was introduced to it a couple of years ago I was so hooked I subscribed to a service that sent me the first three seasons on DVD, one disc after the other, at prices far higher than these boxed sets.  Paladin's combination of erudition, suave but not oily charm, morality, and no-nonsense problem solving is unlikely to be matched by any character on any TV series now or in the future (they don't make 'em like that any more).  The only reason this item receives only 4 stars instead of 5 is that the first two seasons are even better.  If you've never heard of Paladin or Have Gun Will Travel, start with the first season and work your way through to this one.

Nowadays I'm just waiting impatiently for seasons 4-6 to be released on DVD!",1136937600,9,819,4.298701298701299
2419440,5,B000BITUXO,"I became a fan of ""Have Gun-Will Travel"" after buying the first dvd in a Columbia House offer. I enjoyed the show so much that I went out and purchased the entire first season on dvd. I purchased season two when it was released and now I have season three as well. This series holds up well and the quality is fantastic. I just finished watching the first disc of season three and I enjoyed every episode. I like the new opening too, which is similar to season one's opening yet a little different. The quality of the first two seasons of this great series is still with us in season three. And Richard Boone was a fantastic actor. I strongly urge you--buy this set!",1136678400,8,666,4.336

Everything I wrote about HGWT in my seasons 1 and 2 reviews still holds. The best TV writers were still generating excellent scripts, and the marvelous Richard Boone carried everything they wrote and more. It is not possible to heap enough accolades on everyone involved in these productions.

Again, the pristine quality of the B&W cinematography is often breathtaking on locations. It is like Ansel Adams selected the sites and handled the photography.

Amazing series, not to be missed.",1135900800,50,623,5.088235294117647
2419442,5,B000BITUXO,"The 3rd season release for ""Have Gun Will Travel"" includes all 39 episodes aired during the 1959-1960 TV season.  I personally would rate it as another 5-star ""must-have"" for fans of the series such as myself.  Be forewarned, though, that it's a  slightly flawed gem.  I have so far been able to view about a dozen of the episodes on most of the seven discs and would offer the following observations:

1. The advance release from Paramount Home Video said that the total running time for the set was 848 minutes (which would average out to just a little over 21.7 minutes per episode).  This was evidently a mistake.  The episodes all seem to include all available film footage and are about as ""uncut"" as possible.  All of the episodes I've viewed or timed run between 25:30 and 25:50.

2.  Audio and video quality are satisfactory, but the film restoration work for this particular set is a little more uneven than on the first two.  The quality of the work varies from ""acceptable"" to ""really excellent"".  For some of the episodes, the opening and closing credits have not been restored and these segments are noticeably rougher than the rest of the film. Some of the episodes (notably ""Charley Red Dog"" and ""Love of a Bad Woman"") have a somewhat ""murkier"" look than the others.  Some of the episodes include the four-second ""CBS Television Network"" tag at the end and some don't.  I strongly suspect that different people worked on the films and that some did a more conscientious job than others.

3.  Not all of the episodes have the ""Wire Paladin"" extra feature with information about the writers or performers.  This didn't bother me, because I'm not really big on DVD extras, but I know that some buyers take their DVD extras much more seriously than I do.

4. The bottom of the box includes a small-print disclaimer ""Some music has been replaced for this home entertainment version"".  Paramount was evidently unable to license a small portion of the ""interior"" music for video release.  (Different composers apparently did the interior music for the third sesaon.)  This seems to me to be a very minor issue, because I really haven't yet noticed any instance of obvious ""replacement"".  Rest assured, the opening and the closing theme song by Johnny Western are intact and are just as we remember them!

Overall, though, the set's flaws are very minor ones.  Knowing what I know now, I would still be quick to purchase this set and would recommend it most enthusiastically to any fan of the series!  I look forward to Season 4!",1135641600,36,2537,4.737442922374429

Many times one has fond memories of the older TV programs. When they are finally distributed and bought, it is a shocker to find that they are sophomoric or just long cigarette commercials. Well this time you will not be disappointed.

Each episode must find a conflict and solve it in an extraordinarily short time. Each with a moral and still maintain the entertainment value. One of the ways this is accomplished is the use of a wide spectrum of writers; many of the stories are adoptions of classics or became classics of other programs and/or movies.

Each episode is accompanied by a synopses of the story, which by the way is very well done and points out the purpose of the story. Also each episode has a small but interesting biography of the main actors.

One of the finer points of this series is that there usually is no clear cut hero or villain as the characters and themes of the stories are as complete as many ancient myths. We can see virtues and faults in everyone and many times there is no such thing as a clear-cut winner or loser.

Paladin (Richard Boone), a well chosen name as on a chess board there are many moves available, lives in San Francisco and most people assumes he has investments all over the west as he is taking frequent trips to protect them. We know different as ""Have Gun Will Travel"" he makes his fortune on his many skills. Every once in a while we get a gimps of his past as we know he went to West Point and can quote many ancient writings and wars. He has an uncanny way of knowing what the meanings of names are. Yet who ever he really is many people are better off for knowing him. And so are we.

A side benefit is recognizing the list of star (actors) and stars in the making.
