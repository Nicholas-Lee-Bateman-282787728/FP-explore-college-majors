1885447,5,B00009N84F,Mermaid man and Barticle Boy III is probably my favorite episode... all the episodes on this compilation are GREAT!  Wonderful viewing if you're a spongebob fan.,1102464000,,161,5.1923076923076925
1885448,5,B00009N84F,"WAIT BEFORE BUYING, SPONGEBOB SEASON 1 IS COMING, SO ALL OF THE DVD'S RELEASED CONTAINING RANDOM EPSODES WILL BE, WELL ""USELESS"", SO WAIT FOR SEASON 1 TO COME AND HAVE A SEASON COLLECTION OF SPONGEBOB!",1061078400,8,201,4.771428571428571
1885449,4,B00009N84F,"I was really hoping Tide and Seek would include my favorite episode of all time, Neptunes Spatula, but it redeems itself by including Squidsville. Out of many great moments in the Spongebob series, the scene where Squidwards face goes from smile to frown, is pure genius in animation of any kind. Many write Spongebob off as fluff but those that know are aware of the cast's greatness in writing.
The best of the DVD's is still Nautical Nonsense (the first). With SB-129, Texas, and The Graveyard Shift, it'll be hard to beat. I'd put Halloween second. Scardey Pants, Frankendoodle, and Band Geeks are terrific. I'd probably place Tide and Seek in after these two.
Now if Neptunes Spatula and Krusty Crab Training Video are on the next one, one of those top two are going down.",1060128000,6,777,4.720588235294118
1885450,5,B00009N84F,i thought this one was hilarious my favorite episode was squrille jokes. spongebob does stand up at the krusty krab. His first few lokes were lousy so spongebob starts looking around for anything to make a joke about and he sees sandy the squrille and he makes fun of her so every one thinks she is dumb. i thought it was so funny. I think everyone should get this movie if there a spongebob fan. And adults if you think im not going to waste money on a talking sponge and listen to his kiddy jokes. Well you should get it cause there is a lot of jokes that kids don't understand but adults do.,1059091200,,594,4.173913043478261
