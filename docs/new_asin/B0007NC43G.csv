2223667,2,B0007NC43G,Real actors or real dubbers might've made this almost watchable.,1421539200,,64,5.5
2223668,3,B0007NC43G,Not sure what to make of it.  The movie itself was rather sophomoric but the content was engaging.,1421452800,,98,4.444444444444445
2223669,3,B0007NC43G,Based on facts but really pretty pointless as a movie and as real life.,1420588800,,71,4.142857142857143
2223670,2,B0007NC43G,Based on a somewhat true story - I watched it because of the trains. The acting was moronic; the circumstances unrealistic. Not a very plausible explanation of what was an historical issue and a not well thought out plan by a real person with real world consequences. Michael Sarrazin - I hope you were able to cash the check. .,1403049600,6,328,4.483333333333333
2223671,5,B0007NC43G,"I like movies based on true events.  I thought this was very interesting.  I'm glad I watched it.  I'm not a wordy person, so don't have anything else to say",1391299200,,157,4.166666666666667
2223672,4,B0007NC43G,Do not be put off by the title of my review. This movie has problems but it contains an early portrayal of the cultural impact of sociopathy that is worth seeing. The movie is interesting and is one of Sarrazin's better efforts.,1383091200,,228,4.4523809523809526
2223673,3,B0007NC43G,"Michael Sarrazin  plays his part well in an obvious early career film.  Story line lacked the excitement that could have been.  Many may like this film, but it just didn't excite me.",1374364800,2,182,4.625
2223674,3,B0007NC43G,"This movie is based upon the true story of Szilveszter Matuska, a man who derailed trains in 1930-1931 in Austria. His motive is uncertain. Some say it was political, others claim he was a religious fanatic (aka Christian terrorist) while he may have gotten paid. The film shows why there was confusion. In this drama Matuska (Michael Sarrazin) leases a quarry in order to have access to explosives.

The film is foreign and dubbed. It has the look of a low budget foreign production. The train wrecks are not spectacular. The dubbing makes the acting look bad. The action and drama move a bit slow which is why they show you the ending of the film first then jump to the beginning, although that is not made clear until you see the same part played over. It is a film that could easily be redone and better. It is okay for an historical drama.

2223675,5,B0007NC43G,The first time I saw this movie I was riveted by the immersion of Chinese culture depicted in this movie. For over a decade I've been showing this to my Eastern Culture students. It is a marvelous tool for teaching about East Asia.,1184371200,4,231,4.395348837209302
2223676,5,B0007NC43G,HAVE MOVIE ON VHS. WONDERFUL.  HAD THE HONOR OF MEETING NORA LAM IN PERSON AS AN ADULT. WONDERFUL PERSON.,1127088000,3,105,4.526315789473684

2223699,3,B0007NC43G,"The publication of this movie was 1983, not 2006 as noted with this synopsis.  It is terrible music, stiff acting, and typical of 1983 quasi fair. it was very stilted scenes.  The star actor was not that good in protraying a crazy man, that was the general consensus of the perpetrator. I would never watch it again, and not recommend it to anyone.",1446249600,3,348,4.507936507936508
2223700,2,B0007NC43G,This was dubbed and trying. The plot was strange and the actors were just not what I had come to expect. So sad and strange.,1445644800,,124,4.0
2223701,2,B0007NC43G,Poor. I did not like this one.,1437436800,,30,3.4285714285714284

2223704,1,B0007NC43G,"If there were less than one I would give it to this movie.  It was overacted, moved slowly, seemed to have not plot.  I could not recommend this movie.",1433808000,3,151,4.172413793103448
2223705,3,B0007NC43G,not my favorite.,1429142400,,16,4.666666666666667
2223706,3,B0007NC43G,This is based on a true story of the destruction of the famous Orient Express train. It was very graphic and dark tale of a man slowly going mad. The question was; was he mad or was the just crazy. There is a difference you know,1425427200,,228,3.9782608695652173

8049419,4,B0007NC43G,"This is a pretty engrossing story and did engage me. The flow was constant and few, if any scenes were unnecessary to the unfolding of the plot.
 Michael Sarrazin was convincing as a villain. The sound track seemed dubbed.",1483315200,,222,4.6923076923076925

8049421,1,B0007NC43G,It isn't very good.,1468540800,,19,4.0
8049422,2,B0007NC43G,"I thought the subject matter was interesting enough, and the acting, production, etc was acceptable for this Hungarian-made, low-budget movie.  However, the version that I streamed from Amazon was of such poor quality that it was difficult to watch.  This was a VHS copy, as evidenced by the visual noise we were once familiar with when using old VHS tapes.  But the quality seemed even worse than that - more like super 8mm.  Several scenes had signs which I presume were supposed to be legible, but were a total blur.",1468368000,2,519,4.733333333333333
8049423,1,B0007NC43G,Film quality so poor I could not stand to watch it.,1464134400,,51,3.727272727272727
8049424,4,B0007NC43G,"Since it was based on a true story, the plot was more intense.  Not bad for and old movie.",1462579200,,90,3.736842105263158
8049425,1,B0007NC43G,"Pitiful!!  This offering joins the ranks of the films that leave you wondering, ""How in the hell did they get financial backing for this?""  There is literally nothing of value in this . . . shall we say, movie!  Honestly, I am being quite serious. The only reason one star is shown is because it's the lowest ranking there is that will allow the review to be published. Also, I suppose, the makers should be somehow noted for having the courage to release the nasty thing.",1455580800,5,472,4.465116279069767
8049426,2,B0007NC43G,"Moved very slow and choppy.  However, it interesting and historical which was informative.",1449100800,,90,5.923076923076923
