7905264,3,B000007SYC,"In one of Woody Allen's short stories, a magician develops a box which any book placed into can be entered by a person sitting on the box. Woody's  first choice is Madame Bovary, as his desire to meet the eponymous tragic  heroine is so strong. Renoir, a magician of another sort who's made some of  the most enchanting movies of all time, is slightly less successful. As a  film in it's own right, it's OK, but as an adaptation of Flaubert's novel  it leaves a lot to be desired. It's hard to blame Renoir, either for being  attracted to the text, or failing to bring it to the screen succesfully, as  the sheer poetry of the text is almost impossible to replicate, and casting  Emma is an impossible task. Since Renoir, Minnelli and Chabrol have made  simaler failures - maybe it's time to leave Emma to Flaubert's readers  dreams.",967766400,7,833,4.530201342281879
