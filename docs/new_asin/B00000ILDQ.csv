7910807,4,B00000ILDQ,"I enjoyed this video, although it is not really easy to follow. The relaxed rhythm tap style is my personal favorite, but this tape is not the most exciting thing to watch. The warm up section is great. I've used a lot  of the basic drills. The routines that follow are good, but not amazing. I  still haven't had the attention span to really watch and learn all of the  breakdowns of the steps. But it did give me some ideas to use in my own  classes and I'm sure I'll refer to it later when I'm in search of some new  material.",946857600,21,529,4.097087378640777
