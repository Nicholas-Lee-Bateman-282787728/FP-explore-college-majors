1344283,3,B00004RN26,"This film is not quite as bad as some people and reviewers will have you believe! Sure, the dubbing is atrocious and the music is ridiculous but the plot and the acting are top notch!  Christopher Lee and Thorley Walters are excellent as Holmes and Watson. One wishes that Lee's rich baritone wasn't dubbed or anyone else's for that matter. One also wishes Lee when he was younger, would have played Holmes more often. The transfer to DVD is not that good, and the picture a bit fuzzy, but I've seen far worse.  May not be a film for Holmes purists, but for anyone who likes Holmes and/or Lee will enjoy this film.",1144022400,,614,4.424778761061947
1344284,3,B00004RN26,"Over the years I've always read what a bad film this was, so I was pleasantly surprised when I bought this DVD and found the film to be quite good. I think Christopher Lee is a perfect Sherlock Holmes! Granted, it is a disappointment that he was POORLY dubbed in the American version, but this is something I can overlook because the film is a compelling mystery. Besides, Lee is often dubbed in these European films he made in the 60's, like Mario Bava's ""THE WHIP AND THE BODY"" and ""HERCULES IN THE HAUNTED WORLD""; the lame Italian comedy ""UNCLE WAS A VAMPIRE""; ""THE TORTURE CHAMBER OF DR. SADISM"", etc. So, if you can get past that, you'll find an intriguing and well-paced thriller well worth a look for fans of Lee and/or Holmes. The picture is ok, the print is a bit scratched here and there, and is presented full-frame (my big complaint). I'd rather have a widescreen picture myself. Lee is so tall, often the top of his head is cut-off here. Still, I enjoyed it and do recommend it quite highly.",1034380800,27,1004,4.461956521739131
7921423,4,B00004RN26,"Sherlock Holmes and the Deadly Necklace, 1962 film

It begins with ships in a port. London Bridge is in one background scene. Children see an object floating in the bay and throw stones at it. Its a dead man in a bag. Watch one man grab an item from another mans jacket! The automobile says the early twentieth century. [Note the dubbing of voices, the lips do not match the words.] Outside a man calls for help! Dr. Watson left his bag in his car. Holmes appears, then reads the shipping column. Moriarity is interested in ships from Benghazi. The Times has useful information. Theres another man outside. Jenkins says one word then dies! The Police Inspector lectures Holmes on the need for proper legal procedure. Watson deciphers Jenkins last words. The Hare and the Eagle is a public house.

Young woman talk to customers so they order drinks. Dr. Watson offers help to a bar girl. We learn about the man who fell overboard. You can listen to a conversation from a chimney top (as long as you are quiet). What does Moriarity want? A card catalog keeps track of newspaper volumes. They report on a missing treasure. In a country estate Peter Blackburn fires his shotgun. What is he afraid of? He trusts no one. A man with a gun cuts a glass window to enter a house. There is a struggle, then we hear gun shots. A dog barks in the night. A telephone call summons the police. What is buried in the lawn? The police will block all the roads. Sherlock deduced what happened. Will the wrong man be accused? The Inspector finds buried clothes (no moat). [No blood spatter evidence?] The hands of a dead man identify him as a working man. Will Mrs. Blackburn tell what really happened? They go to a secret room, Peter is dead! They find the letters MOR. Who has that valuable jewelry case with Cleopatras Necklace?

We see automobiles from the early 20th century on the streets. There is a slight accident with Dr. Watsons car. A diversion? A disguised Holmes visits a large house using a key. It has antique treasures. Is it guarded? Yes! Homes acquires that jewel case and departs. Moriarity returns to his house and discovers the intrusion. The Times reports the found necklace. Moriarity has a penalty for failure. He visits the police, then offers a police search of his home, then leaves. Later Holmes gets an offer for a deal; it is refused. A whistle causes those men to flee. There is a scene in the Hare and Eagle. Moriaritys chauffeur seeks two men for a job. He sees one man and offers him a job. Can that necklace be stolen from police custody? We see how this is accomplished, and foiled by Sherlock Holmes. People gather at that auction house. Where is that jewelry case? A postman delivers it! Is it authentic? Professor Moriarity validates it. Alls well that ends well. Homes tells about a gang of jewel thieves who were caught. And what of Moriarity? Come along Watson, we have work to do.

Why did Moriarity escape? To allow his reappearance in a sequel! This story was filmed by a German movie company. The screenplay was written by Curt Siodmak, famous for many of the Hollywood Horror movies in the 1930s and 1940s. He invented many of the details of the legends (garlic against vampires, silver bullets against werewolves). You will recognize parts from the many Sherlock Holmes stories in this movie: the stolen treasure (The Sign of the Four), the murdered man without a face (The Valley of Fear). Aside from the TV episodes produced in 1950s France with Ronald Howard, it is unusual to see a Sherlock Holmes movie made outside of an English-speaking country. Note the difference in culture (the scenes in the public house).",1471219200,,3646,4.630602782071097
7921424,2,B00004RN26,This is a German movie dubbed in English.  One of Christopher Lee's features is his voice which isn't his in this movie.  The storyline is confusing.  The costumes are ridiculous - apparently they couldn't decide whether the action is happening in the 19th century or the 20th.  They have things like a  horse-drawn hansom cab driving down the street while pedestrians are in 1950's clothing.  Not worth it unless you want a good laugh.,1463788800,,436,4.824324324324325
7921425,3,B00004RN26,"This is a weird one.  The script by veteran screenwriter Curt Siodmak (The Wolfman) is actually rather clever and the film is credited to Hammer director Terence Fisher.  The film also features a nice version of favorite villain Dr Moriarty.  With Christopher Lee as Holmes what could possibly go wrong?

Well, for some reason Sherlock Holmes and the Deadly Necklace was shot in German, somewhat in the style of the Edgar Wallace adaptations that were popular in Germany at the time.  All of the actors (including Christopher Lee) were dubbed into English, making the film feel somewhat off when you are watching it.  The first time I viewed Sherlock Holmes and the Deadly Necklace it took me about 20 minutes to get used to the dubbing.

That said this is still a pretty good movie with a solid story, good dialogue, a suitably evil villain.  It's just a shame we can't hear Christopher Lee play Sherlock Holmes in his own distinctive voice,",1460160000,,942,4.771604938271605
7921426,5,B00004RN26,"As Lee fan I had to have this and I got this years ago on vhs and like some of the reviews I first thought it was not very good with the average
quality and not so good dubbing. But since I been watching all my Holmes collections I viewed this one again and I loved it. I thought the
story was well written by Curt Siodmak who wrote many universal horrors and other great mystery stories and Lee is terrific as Holmes
but of course Cushing was the best Holmes ever on screen even over Rathbone. The dubbing is not very good but my version does at
least sound like Lee's voice but I could be wrong. But I enjoyed the movie so much I watched it again and the ending is brilliant. Too bad
he didn't make another one and that this one isn't re-mastered with Lee's voice to match the dubbing and in wide screen!",1452902400,,806,4.1075949367088604

7921428,3,B00004RN26,"Amazon says the film is in colour - I don't know whether this is a mistake, since this was filmed in black-and-white, or whether someone had the bright idea to colourize it.

This is a rather bizarre film, shot in Germany in English, but then redubbed (badly) by American actors. Oddly, then, Hammer horror stalwarts Christopher Lee and Thorley Walters, as Holmes and a very Nigel-Bruceian Watson, are seen but never heard. It has an incongruous, but extremely catchy jazz score by bandleader Martin Slavin.

The film has the look and feel of a 1930s picture, a Charlie Chan or Universal horror - perhaps not surprising, since the screenwriter was Universal veteran Curt Siodmak (The Wolf Man).

It is not what you would expect of Terence Fisher, one of the alltime greatest horror directors, and it is certainly no classic. I must confess, however, I actually enjoyed it, and would watch it again.

It did make me pine for what might have been if Lee had been given the chance to play Holmes in a better film.",1160352000,8,1010,4.6892655367231635
7921429,3,B00004RN26,"Horror maestro Christopher Lee played Mycroft Holmes and Sir Henry Baskerville, but was hardly ever seen as the great Sherlock. That was in ""Sherlock Holmes and the Deadly Necklace,"" a solid enough mystery with some very nice acting, beautiful sets... and really wretched dub work.

An informant of Sherlock Holms (Lee) totters up to his doorstep, and dies after gasping a cryptic message. Holmes and Watson (Thorley Walters) follow his message to the pub where Professor Moriarty (Hans S&ouml;hnker) is staying, and overhear Moriarty plotting a murder and a theft -- of an astounding necklace found in the tomb of Cleopatra.

They rush to a country estate to save the paranoid lord-of-the-manor, only to arrive too late -- the necklace is gone, and the man himself is dead. Now Holmes must infiltrate Moriarty's home to steal back the necklace, and get it to the auction before Moriarty can steal it back.

""Deadly Necklace"" is definitely a mixed bag, as a Sherlock Holmes movie goes -- we have the basics of a Holmes movie, and some of them are really amazing. But often, it feels like Terence Fisher is directing on autopilot, leaving it to Christopher Lee to keep the movie afloat.

There are some wonderfully quick-moving subplots, such as the question of who shot the guy in the castle, buried clothes, and bloody footprints. Alas, many other parts of the movie are either plodding or confusing, which can be fatal to a mystery story. The park-bench scene with Moriarty and Holmes is a perfect example -- it feels like it was crammed in to take up some extra time. It really has nothing to do with the plot, and could have been cut without any effect.

Lee is a simply magnificent Holmes, and perhaps the best ""one off"" Holmes I've ever seen. He comes across as intelligent without having to work at it, and still tough enough to kick through an oak door. Thorley Walters makes a likably bumbly Watson, and provides a good thought-bouncer for Lee, but S&ouml;hnker makes a very hammy Moriarty. Not an ounce of menace, and the scene where he runs from Holmes is unintentionally funny.

And what about the infamous dubbing? Well, it's really bad. Lee's rich baritone is covered by someone who sounds like he's doing a Christopher Lee impersonation, sometimes sounding American (and when undercover, swishy). Even stranger, there's a hollow echo effect whenever anyone speaks. It sounds like the dubbing was done in a giant bathroom. As the final indignifty, they tack on a fluffy jazz soundtrack that doesn't match the setting.

There are some deep, intense flaws in ""Sherlock Holmes and the Deadly Necklace,"" but even with a dubbed voice Christopher Lee carries the film with rare style. Watch for his performance, if no other reason.",1154131200,6,2739,4.877419354838709
