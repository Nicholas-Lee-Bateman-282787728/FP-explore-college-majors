7759024,4,B01G91FSOQ,"The disc contains three sections.  The first two are about Germany and the third is about Austria. If you wish to learn a good deal about a limited part of Germany, this DVD is wonderful.  The photography is beautiful and done from the air.  Unfortunately, we were unable to view all of the segment on Austria because the DVD became ""stuck"".  This is not a normal function of our player.",1489017600,2,387,4.485714285714286

8762555,5,B01G91FSOQ,This was playing at a new to is German restaurant one evening on a large screen and we fell in love with it.  We were able to find out what video it was and ordered a copy for ourselves from Amazon right from the table before dessert.  It brought back many good memories of times in Germany.  It can be enjoyed with or without the volume up.,1532390400,,341,4.059701492537314
