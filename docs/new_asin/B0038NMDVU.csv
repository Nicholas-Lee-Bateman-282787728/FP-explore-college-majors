8391560,5,B0038NMDVU,"two live shows taped in '70 and '73 capture broughton on german (as a 3 piece) and swedish television (as a 4 piece).  the video and sound quality are superb.  seven songs are played totalling 48 minutes of music.  most of the material is from Wasa, Wasa and Edgar Broughton Band.  the only song i didn't like was the first track, American Boy Soldier because the german television ran lyrics right across the middle of the screen.  they highlight key words in english and german.  it's very annoying.  thankfully it's only on the one track.  anyway, this is a must have for any broughton band fan.  i only wish it was longer.  cheers!",1299196800,7,635,4.539823008849558
