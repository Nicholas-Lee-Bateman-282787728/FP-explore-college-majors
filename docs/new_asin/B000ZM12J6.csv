I still have those VHS tapes and I have watched them so many times, it's unreal. My whole family got into this show...there is strong character development and not every character is clearly good or bad. Such an interesting story, with great animation for it's age. The music is different, and actually really good. A friend of mine made a soundtrack of it and it is great. I can't say enough good things about this show. I would say the only non-comedy cartoon since that can compare in quality is Avatar, which is on Nickelodeon now.",1202083200,2,703,4.587301587301587
8235904,5,B000ZM12J6,"I watched this series when I was five years old, and it drew me in as no other show before or since. It hasn't been broadcast on television for nearly eighteen years, and due to copyright issues it hasn't been released on DVD (or VHS) in English. Fans will be happy to know that those issues have been resolved, and an English version should be available by the end of the year. Also, a movie is currently in the works, with a probable release date sometime in 2009.",1201392000,7,466,4.306818181818182
8235905,4,B000ZM12J6,I remember this as a little kid and loved it.  Watching it 15 years later it loses a little.  In all though a very interesting classic cartoon with some really cool story ideas.,1198022400,,177,4.333333333333333
