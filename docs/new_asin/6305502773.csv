7890959,5,6305502773,The beauty of Mt Whitney and the Lone Pine area in early spring gives plenty of eye candy to this out of the ordinary western.  Robt Lansing and Pat Wayne are teamed up by circumstance and then the plot twists and turns from there.  Tight direction and a fine eye for locations by the cinematographer make a strong story a pleasure to watch.  This isn't your run of the mill oater.  Bad bad guys and strong good guys make this high and wide.  Worth watching over and over to make sure you don't miss anything,1368835200,2,508,4.3052631578947365
7890960,2,6305502773,"I just watched this movie for the first time at home on the specific dvd sold at this site...It is listed at 92 minutes, which is accurate by my measure also. However, the film, according to other sources was originally 106 minutes.  So, if you buy this be aware that 14 minutes have been cut from the original movie at some point in the sales ""pipeline."" Thus I will only give this two stars, which is probably generous considering how much was cut.",1358726400,,450,4.421686746987952

7890962,5,6305502773,"I've been looking to buy this movie for decades. A long time ago I saw this movie and thought it was a unique idea for a western: two bounty hunters, one with a lame shooting hand, one blinded , combine to become one: one with the eyes to see, the other with the hand to shoot. Together they go after the outlaw that wounded them both. Now, this is not the best movie ever, but it is a neat little tale. There's a simple plot, the beautiful scenery of the Alabama Hills of the eastern Sierras and a solid cast that includes John Wayne's son, Patrick, in his first major role and Robert Lansing, a very underrated actor. If you like westerns I would recommend that you check out ""An Eye for an Eye"".",1283126400,,698,4.2164179104477615
7890963,4,6305502773,"Rising above most low budget B-westerns, An Eye for An Eye is a step above because it tries to do something different with the plotline that you've most likely not seen in a western before.  A farmer and former bounty hunter, Talion, comes home one day to find his wife and son murdered and their house burning, work of murderous bandit Ike Slant. On the trail for Slant, Talion meets another bounty hunter, Benny Wallace, so they form an uneasy partnership in hopes of getting Slant and his gang.  But in a showdown with Slant, Talion's gun-hand is crippled and Benny is blinded.  Now the only way the duo can defeat Slant is for Talion to tell Benny where and when to shoot.  The tagline for the movie was 'the strangest gun in the west' and it's pretty dead-on.  All around though, this was very enjoyable for a low-budget western, especially a crippled Talion and a blind Benny trying to figure out how to defeat Slant.  It's not The Searchers or The Wild Bunch, but An Eye for An Eye is definitely worth a watch.

 Typically a television actor, Robert Lansing takes the lead here as Talion, a former bounty hunter back on the trail for the man who murdered his family.  Pat Wayne joins Talion as Benny Wallace, a young bounty hunter with a past trying to make a name for himself.  The scenes of Talion shouting directions to Benny where to shoot are the high point of the movie as their relation develops; two men completely dependent on each other for survival.  Slim Pickens has a rare bad-guy role as Ike Slant, the bandit with a grudge who goes after Talion's family.  Pickens is really enjoying himself here playing the baddie.  Gloria Talbot is good in a small part as Bri Quince, a young woman who takes an interest in Talion.  Western character actors Paul Fix and Strother Martin join the supporting cast.  And last, a very young Clint Howard is very good as Jo-Hi, Paul Fix's son who is curious as to what Talion and Benny are doing.

 As for the DVD, no special features here, but there is a cleaned-up fullscreen presentation.  The filming locations offer some beautiful shots in and around the Alabama Hills in California.  Western fans take note, this is a good western with a twist.  Give An Eye for An Eye a chance!",1226361600,7,2236,4.528678304239402
