8161972,5,B000LJJXXK,"This was by far the best of this series.  The music was much better, and the behind the scenes looks at what the mechanics and team managers add to the effort was priceless.  I've watched this three times already and if I were wanting to show someone what the outdoor series was like, I would show them this DVD.

If you are into thrash metal, screaming lyrics, and the type of music that drives anyone over the age of 25 from the room, you probably will not like this edition.",1174262400,2,477,4.277777777777778
