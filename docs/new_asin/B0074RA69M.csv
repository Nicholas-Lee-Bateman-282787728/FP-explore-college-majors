8510198,4,B0074RA69M,We spent a lot of time watching youtube videos of shimajiro and I preferred to have the DVDs on hand. It is pricy but I could not find cheaper DVDs online. The videos are sometimes really weird and hilarious. The songs and dances are cute. Also you need an all region dvd player. .,1388188800,,281,4.222222222222222
