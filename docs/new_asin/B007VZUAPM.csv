It begins with a map of the world, then shows a small island in the Weddell Sea. A volcano explodes, then icebergs form. Radar antennae rotate in many areas to provide an early warning system (the DEW line). One radar station has a blip. Then snow and ice come into the broken window! There is no longer contact with this outpost. A light plane is sent to inspect the damage. Where are the men? What happened? Another sighting causes a Red Alert, but the airplanes are recalled. Then a transport airplane crashes. It is searched, no bodies are found. They found a strange object. It is reported, it is not bone but something like a part from an insect. Professor Jackson explains various forms of life. The most voracious flesh-eating insect is the Preying Mantis. They are not much bigger than a clothespin. [Remember them?] Those strange tracks in the snow are measured. Eight and a half feet. Back at the base the soldiers use the recreation room.

Professor Jackson uses his slide-rule for calculation. [Remember them?] A big insect approaches the base at night. Condition Red. A flame thrower and a machine gun try to stop it! Jet airplanes (F-84's) patrol the skies by day. Television is used to warn the public. This gigantic insect flies south. The Navy launches F9Fs from an aircraft carrier to hunt this creature. They fire rockets but it flies into the clouds. A Teletype machine reports problems around the country. There is a train wreck in the fog. [Recognize those old cars?] A bus crashes in the fog, but there are no bodies! A General Alert is issued! Jet fighters are sent aloft. Will this voracious insect attack Washington and gobble up Congressmen? Or other high officials. Surely that would be a disaster, even if the people would elect a new a new crop. Of course the evil insect will be stopped by good guys with arms. Then all will be well. At least until there is another threat.

Are those soldiers lonely? No, theres a woman behind every tree. The problem is to find those trees. This movie shows the attitudes and culture of the mid-1950's. A scary movie, like the horror movies of the 1930's, can symbolize economic conditions. [There was an economic recession in 1957.] Or a monster can symbolize fears of foreign invasion, one of the worst events for any country. I enjoyed this movie because the threat didn't seem real to me. Did they have a spray can of DDT? Note the many obsolete objects. Window vents on automobiles. A Teletype machine (an input/output device) printing to paper tape. Electronic devices used vacuum tubes. What happened when a filament burned out?
This movie echoes Beowulf, the oldest literary work in English. Someone was killing the thanes of King Hrothgar, Beowulf was put on the job.",1508025600,,2773,4.74896265560166
