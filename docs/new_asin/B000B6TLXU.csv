8082586,4,B000B6TLXU,"I bought this for Five Corners.  A quirky independent film with a strong cast, it mixes light touches and the very serious in unpredictable ways.  The main action takes place over a couple days in the Bronx in 1964.  John Turturro returns to his neighborhood with pent-up anger, particularly against Jodie Foster, the timid victim of the attempted rape that sent him to prison.  Tim Robbins was her savior then, now only interested in preparing to become a civil rights freedom rider.  Todd Graff is her willing but ineffectual boyfriend, crippled trying to stop the attempted rape.  As Turturro tries to reestablish contact with Foster, she seeks Robbins' protection while trying to keep her boyfriend from getting hurt again.  A subplot involves a couple out-of-control women and a couple mischief-making men who provide some comic relief and more.  And there are penguins and mysterious bow and arrow shootings.  There is a slightly surreal edge, and a peculiar usage of the famous duet from Delibes' Lakme.

Though very much its own thing, the nostalgia and offbeat mood reminded me of American Graffiti and Diner at times.  The acting and rich dramatic texture drew me in so that I was willing to follow the odd turns without complaint.  Turturro is particularly impressive.  Unlike some, I didn't think the film fell apart at the end, which made as much sense as the rest and had some strong dramatic content.  Very much worth seeing.

The DVD transfer is somewhat dark, soft, pixelly at times, not very good color, pan-and-scan.  Sound is OK mono.  Because of the poor quality I had to use the stop-action function to see who did what at a crucial point at the end.  There are other editions out on DVD (search DVDs for the title), but the transfers may not be any better than this one.  See&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/here/dp/6304609434/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">here</a>&nbsp;for some more reviews.  (Keep in mind that unless a review says which DVD release it's commenting on, it might not be the one for which the review is posted, so most of the remarks about video quality, including the ones from Amazon itself, aren't very useful.)

This Disc Plaza/Cascadia release is a bit under 90 minutes.  According to the times listed for other DVD releases, most are 92 minutes, one is listed at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/93/dp/6304609434/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">93</a>, and a VHS edition is listed at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/94/dp/B000AMEM34/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">94</a>.  Such figures aren't always correct, but it may be that there are slightly different cuts of the film.

The second film, Who Shot Pat?, is low-budget, with second- and third-tier acting, writing and, well, pretty much everything.  But it's well intentioned, sweet, and does have Sandra Bullock in a very early, pre-fame role.  The first time I saw it I hated it, and wrote a harsh review of it here, but coming at it again (more or less accidentally) with very low expectations allowed its better points, such as they are, to come forward.

It's basically a coming-of-age nostalgia piece, predominantly comedic in tone.  A group of guys at a late 1950s Brooklyn technical high school fight, talk about fighting, get into trouble, have some not-quite-Mr.-Chips moments, a talent show, and fight.  There is some angst connected with the fighting, and a bit of race friction, though the only gang activity is among whites.  There's also the mystery of who shot Pat, which is resolved before the last reel, and isn't central.  The humor isn't brilliant, but it's less insulting to the mind than a good deal of movie humor.

The female roles are secondary.  The main character has a rather implausible romance with Bullock's character, a Sarah Lawrence College student from the rich side of the tracks, who is oddly willing.  Bullock has enough screen time, and brief romantic moments, to make this worth seeking out for big fans or the curious, but don't expect a major role, great acting, or a very full range of her trademark expressions.

The music is a weird mix of 50s songs and sparely used cheesy 70s-sounding film scoring, with a 70s-ish romantic duet.  Odd, since the film came out in 1989.  There's some swearing (including the f-word) and sexual humor.  Bullock has a gratuitous, brief, and not very revealing nude scene that will add to the attraction for some.

The DVD transfer is OK for the price, which is to say a little soft, somewhat pixelly when the camera moves, good color, full screen.
