8013889,5,B0001KNHV8,"This dvd is awesome. Even though it is an older anime, the quality is excelent and has aged well. Throughout the anime the lipflaps and voice-overs don't match up, but that is easily ignored. The dub is a little old and some voice actors are a little hard to listen too, but others are fine. The main charecters for example, are fine. But the bad guys can be painful to listen to at times. The story is excellent, but due to the series not covering all the books it was based on leaves the ending unsatisfieng. Still, I loved the anime, adn it has become one of my top favorites despite its short comings. If you like good quality animation and a good fantasy story with superpowers, you will like this anime. Provided you can ignore the lip flaps and some dubbing hindrances. I haven't watched the subbed version, so I can't coment on that.",1233792000,,841,4.432258064516129
