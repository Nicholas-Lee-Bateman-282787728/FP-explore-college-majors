422774,3,6302111285,"Although often mistaken for an Amicus Production, (creators of most of those terrific portmanteu horror films from the 60's and 70's Tales From The Crypt, Vault Of Horror etc...), this is actually not related to that production company, however, it was directed by Hammer and Amicus stalwart, Freddie Francis. I like Francis as a director, really dig Joan Collins and love horror anthology movies in general. But it still took me 3 separate viewings to finish this one. It was just so dull.

Donald Pleasence is dry and monotonous as usual in the framing segment as he takes another doctor on a tour of the mental hospital where he works. He introduces him to four patients, each of whom has a ""tale that is supposed to witness madness"". These include: a young boy with constantly bickering parents who creates an imaginary playmate - a ferocious lion. A man who receives a penny farthing bicycle that is a time machine. Joan Collins and a rotting piece of tree fighting over a man. And a luau party thrown by a woman who does not realize that her own daughter is the sacrificial guest of honor.

None of the four stories were particularly interesting, the wraparound was dry and there was little to no gore (not that that is so important but at least it would have provided some entertainment). If you are looking for a scary movie, this certainly will not do the trick, as it plays off more like a ridiculous spoof of the genre than displaying any real horror. The film has been remastered and looks terrific but, with its steep price tag, is hard to recommend other than to horror anthology completists.",1338422400,3,1606,4.671378091872792
422775,2,6302111285,"BEWARE: Spoilers Ahead!

In all honesty, this 1973 entry into the portmanteau film series that seemed so popular in the UK in the late 60's/early 70's does little to distinguish itself from its competition, mostly due to its muddled script and somewhat obvious twists. If you've ever seen a few of these portmanteau films (The House That Dripped Blood, Torture Garden, Asylum, etc.), you pretty much know what to expect from this one - a series of twisted tales presented with a wraparound framing story. The success of these types of films lives or dies depending on the tales told and, unfortunately, this film doesn't offer much in the originality department (and this film also seems to lack a bit in the coherent department as well). As is also typical of these films, there are some fine actors and actresses engaging in the silliness and it only serves to have you hold out more hope that the film just might improve (yet they rarely do).

In this offering, we have the always excellent Donald Pleasance showing Jack Hawkins around his asylum vaguely hinting at the ""breakthrough"" that he's attained involving each of his patients. The four patients comprise the film's four stories and we see just what brought them to the asylum in the first place.

The first segment is simply titled ""Mr. Tiger"" and involves a lonely, introverted boy who converses with an imaginary friend he calls Mr. Tiger. The boy's parents are the typical argumentative, unlikable lot that constantly bicker and seem to have little to no interest in their son. However, when the boy's interest in Mr. Tiger becomes a little too pronounced, the mother and father argue about it until the segment reaches its rather predictable climax. There's not much going on here, but it is amusing to think of this as a demented live-action ""Calvin and Hobbes"" strip, perhaps made by Bill Watterson if he just didn't give a crap about his creation anymore. The tiger effects are of the not-very-special variety, but they do provide some unintentional humor.

After that less-than-thrilling start, we move on to the nearly incomprehensible ""Penny Farthing"" segment. I say 'incomprehensible' because I'm still not quite sure what was going on in this segment. Peter McHenry inherits some old junk from his distant dead aunt which happens to include an old-timey bicycle (the Penny Farthing of the title) and a ridiculous portrait of his Uncle Albert. For reasons made not quite clear, the portrait is haunted by the spirit of Uncle Albert and the bicycle acts as some sort of time machine. McHenry goes back in time but also manages to bring his corpse-like Uncle Albert with him (who disappears from the present time portrait whenever McHenry goes back in time). We see some old-timey stuff, McHenry talks to a woman named Polly and that's pretty much it. We get the sense McHenry is supposed to do something back in this timeline (y'know... like Sam Beckett, righting what once went wrong and hoping that each leap... will be the leap home...), but it's never really spelled out. Eventually, all this time travel puts McHenry's present day wife in jeopardy and he ends up riding the bicycle while a fire breaks out. He goes back in time, is on fire and when he gets put out, he's the corpse of Uncle Albert. Then McHenry wakes up in present time, his wife is dead (killed by a knife to the back from Uncle Albert since fire wasn't good enough), his store's on fire and he's got some nasty burns on his face. What a bummer. Now you understand why he didn't like to hang around his stupid aunt and uncle when he was a kid. At least, that's all I got from this incoherent story. This story begs for some sort of explanation, but you never really get any. I mean, Uncle Albert was somehow able to transfer his spirit or his essence into a portrait, somehow managed to turn the bicycle into a time machine, has the ability to pull McHenry to the bicycle whenever McHenry refuses to go time-traveling and Uncle Albert can manipulate things in the material world... so with all this awesome power, what the heck does he need his nephew for? I assume the nephew is supposed to be a vessel or something for Uncle Albert to possess once the nephew goes back in time, but that's just a guess because I've read too many time-travel stories and have seen too many of these types of films. However, if that's the case, why leave the nephew with memories of the future when he goes back in time? It doesn't really make any sense and the only real fun to be had in this segment is watching Uncle Albert's portrait change whenever something strange happens (seriously, if he doesn't like something, he scowls in the portrait; if he's engaging in magic, he does that wide-eyed magician look; his face follows people around the room like it was one of those pictures with the eyes that move). Uncle Albert's a crack-up because he's the most expressive portrait you'll ever see in your life. It makes me kinda wish I had a portrait like that just so I could get a few laughs out of my friends. Uncle Albert ranks right up there with a picture I saw in a Chinatown shop that changes from a tiger to a bikini-clad woman when you walk by it. Neither picture makes much sense, but it definitely sticks in your mind, owing to the sheer WTF-ness of it.

Next up is a tale titled ""Mel"" (which is another thing about this movie - the names of the stories aren't particularly imaginative and it sort of detracts from building up any sort of curiosity or interest. It's like if John Steinbeck called 'Of Mice and Men' simply 'Lenny and George'. Naming a story after one of the characters in it sometimes loses the imagination or impact of the story). Anyways, this story is about a guy named Brian who brings in some dead tree trunk into his house as some sort of art object. Naturally, this strikes his stunningly beautiful wife Bella as a little odd and crazy. Of course, Brian only confirms her worries as he begins to grow more and more attached to this dead tree trunk he names Mel. Okay, this segment asks you to suspend your disbelief a little too much with the sheer ridiculousness of it - and I'm not talking about the fact that this dead tree trunk is somehow anthropomorphic and can seemingly hypnotize Brian - no, I'm talking about the fact that this film expects me to believe that a tree is somehow more appealing than the red-hot attractiveness of an early 70's Joan Collins. Regardless of how silly the fashions are of the early 1970's, Joan always manages to look smashing and the segment even goes so far as to have her wearing a sexy teddy and looking gorgeous doing it. However, even though she tries to win Brian back by being all kinds of crazy-sexy, he's still in love with the tree and that's something I just can't get past in this segment. This absurdity leads me to my next problem with these portmanteau films - inevitably, there's always a segment where a rather shabby-looking (usually old) British guy is somehow romantically involved with the most attractive British women you can imagine (it's usually Ingrid Pitt in a lot of the Amicus films, but in this one it's Joan Collins). The story always centers on how the shabby guy is not even the least bit interested in the so-beautiful-it-hurts sexiness of his girlfriend/wife/whatever. Now I know these movies are supposed to cast incredibly beautiful women in them because that helps sell the movie, but when I'm watching a story like this one, I just can't accept that plot contrivance. This segment just takes it that extra step by having the shabby guy in love with a tree. Honestly, I don't get the point of this story. No attempt is made to explain why the tree is somehow alive and there seems to be no particular reason why David prefers the tree over the hotness that is Joan Collins. Mostly this story is just an excuse to show Joan Collins running around scantily clad, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I'm also a story guy and I'd like to know just what all the running around is for. There is a dream sequence where the tree attacks Joan Collins and I don't really understand why it's there. It reminds me of a film called 'The Guardian' directed by William Friedkin about a tree that comes to life and becomes a nanny (sounds like a comedy, but it's a horror film and Friedkin himself says it's scarier than 'The Exorcist' - which shows you just how much crazy floats around Friedkin's mind). Anyways, there's not much point in watching this segment unless you have an obvious mad crush on early 70's Joan Collins like I do.

Finally, we're at the last story entitled ""Luau"" which features Kim Novak. You might remember Ms. Novak from such films as Alfred Hitchcock's 'Vertigo' or Otto Preminger's 'The Man with the Golden Arm' - again, she's another beauty who appears in this film for reasons unknown. In fact, she had semi-retired from acting for four years prior to this film. Why she chose this film as her comeback is beyond me... maybe she owed the director a favor or something. Anyways, to tell you the truth, my mind sort of drifted while watching this segment as it's painfully dull, overlong and just not particularly engaging. From what I've gathered it's about Kim Novak trying to court what looks like the British equivalent of Ian Somerhalder. Ian acts like a space-case and is more interested in Novak's daughter. Novak organizes an elaborate party for Ian, but it turns out to be a ceremony involving some voodoo mumbo jumbo and cannibalism. Yeah, I probably spoiled a plot point for you, but honestly, you're really not going to care too much where this segment is going. Another trap of these films is to always showcase some sort of bizarre ritual based on the culture of some foreign, exotic land - but they always ruin this concept by making the story too long and boring as all get out. The only one of these that I've seen executed effectively was the Zuni fetish doll sequence in 'Trilogy of Terror'. However, that's not what you're getting here. Instead, there's some boring background, some more boring talking, a boring ritual sequence, a naked rear-end, more boring stuff and a boring ending. There, I just saved you about 20 minutes of time you wouldn't otherwise get back. It's like these films intentionally pad out these boring stories to make the film 90 minutes. Hey man, if time's an issue, film an additional story to fill out the 90 minutes. It doesn't really matter if you have no material left to film because most would argue you didn't have any material to make this film in the first place. Anyways, the last story just sort of leaves you with a 'meh' feeling, which would be alright since the whole film's kind of 'meh', but then you did just watch a story about an anthropomorphic tree so I guess you kind of figured the last story would be something truly out there. Instead it's just a bunch of nonsense that makes you wish you could go back to watching Joan Collins run around a forest in a nightgown.

So, after all that, we return to the wraparound story and Donald Pleasance reveals his ""breakthrough"" that he's been yammering about all through the film. It's a spectacular letdown and the film ends pretty much as you'd expect. While it's not the same old ""oh, all the characters were dead from the beginning..."" ending, but it's just as tired. In fact, I believe 'Asylum' almost ended the same exact way. Titles come up: The End.

Ultimately, this is a film that doesn't try very hard to distinguish itself from other films in a similar vein. Sure, there's some competent direction from Freddie Francis, the cast is pretty awesome and there's enough amusing WTF moments to make you smile, but it's really nothing much. Other films have done the anthology format better and unless you're a huge fan of these types of films, you're really not going to go out of your way to see it. A few items of interest: the film also features one of the most ridiculous scores I've ever heard from Bernard Ebbinghouse - he uses particular instruments in inappropriate places (in example, the ending of ""Mr. Tiger"" with the harmonica - what the crap? Is this a spaghetti western all of a sudden? What's up with the percussion during the dream sequence of ""Mel""? Do trees always sound this annoying in dreams?), so much so, that it detracts from the film. It's not 'Exorcist II' bad, but it's getting there. Finally, there's the VHS box cover... If you haven't seen it, it depicts what looks to be a severed head on a serving plate at a dinner table. It's eye-catching, but it has nothing to do with the movie. There's no scene even remotely related to that in the film, but I'm assuming this video art was created in the 1980's. I grew up in the golden age of video rentals and it seemed like all the VHS box art from the 1980's was highly misleading, none more so than in the case of horror films. Most of the box art represented nearly nothing from the film it promoted and sometimes even seemed to be from some other film entirely. Imagine a Friday night when you get your homework done early, you ride your bike to the video store, you cruise the horror section and find the most depraved video cover you can find, you rent the tape, pop it in expecting to see something akin to what the cover promises and what you actually see is some pile of wall-to-wall crap that runs for 90 minutes straight which doesn't even feature the cool scene that the cover of the video promotes! How many times did that happen to me as a kid? A lot. The only thing more misleading than VHS horror film covers were the boxes to Nintendo games. They also promoted more fun than what was actually inside and, remember, back then there was no internet - they only way you found out if these movies or games sucked was after you already paid your money to rent it (or buy it, you poor soul). Ah, good times...

My apologies. I went off on a tangent on the end there, but this film pretty much epitomized that very particular feeling you used to get when you rented a turd of a movie. 'Tales That Witness Madness' may, in fact, be a bit of a turd, but it's a highly-polished turd. If you're a fan of portmanteau films, you'll watch this. If you're just a casual horror fan, I'd say move on to the next film on your list - you won't be missing much here.

422778,3,6302111285,"TALES THAT WITNESS MADNESS brings us four tales of terror, helmed by reputable horror director Freddie Francis and released in 1973.  HALLOWEEN's Donald Pleasance and the venerable British legend JACK HAWKINS frame the four tales with some kind of gibberish about Pleasance finding out the horrible ""secrets"" of four mental patients.  The first is a little boy whose invisible tiger takes an intense dislike to his bickering parents (including Broadway's Georgia Brown in a surprisingly banal performance); Peter McEnery and Suzy Kendall fare a little better in the muddled, but spooky, tale of a bicycle that takes McEnery into the past, for what purpose, I never figured out; sultry Joan Collins and the bland Michael Jayston (NICHOLAS AND ALEXANDRA) play out a two-character drama about a wife jealous of her husband's new found ""tree""; and the ever lovely Kim Novak overemotes her way through a lurid tale about human sacrifice and a particularly disturbing luau.  More imaginative direction and some recasting might have made this a classic; however, as it is, it's fun to recapture the style of these horror movies of the 70s.  Note that the score was done by Bernard Ebbinghouse, who helmed the Living Strings for several years in the 70s.",1082332800,15,1246,5.0931372549019605
422779,2,6302111285,"Director Freddie Francis was recruited for this one after he had some success for Amicus films with Tales from the crypt. This film was made in an attempt to cash on the success Amicus had had with anthologies. This is not the bomb that some make it out to be, but it could be described as being very flat. This film fails to develop any real style and just lacks much of a punch.  The framing story has Donald Pleasance claiming he has had a major break through with patients he works with at the asylum and then we get to hear all of their stories. The first story centers around a boy who has an invisible tiger he talks to and the tiger doesn't like the boy's argumentitive parents. This story is almost painfully dull, no real thrills and stale performances. The second story steps it up a notch or two as we deal with a time travel story. A man inherits an old picture and a bicycle from a relative and the picture of his Uncle Albert pulls him to the bicycle and that in turn takes him back in time. The story is mildy interesting, but is greatly helped by a very fast pace. This story could have been even better with stronger lead performances. Some Amicus films like Torture Garden and Asylum did not have great stories, but they helped themselves out by getting some veteren character actors to make them stronger. The third story is the strangestof the four, but certainly the best. Joan Collins turns is her usual solid showing as a wife competing for husband's affections with a tree. An odd concept, but they pull it off with decent acting and by showing the trees gradual transformation from an object to something almost human. The fourth story is quite possibly worse than the first if only because it is every bit as dull and it is even longer in legnth. Kim Novak swoons over a client while he plots to use her daughter as a human sacrifice. This one is so drawn out with virtually nothing to redeem it. Freddie Francis did a number of fine horror films such as Dracula has risen from the grave, Nightmare and the Creeping flesh and many of his films benefitted from some nice visuals, but this film has very few of those to offer. This one is worth seeing at least once just for the tree segment.",992563200,6,2217,4.394160583941606

422799,1,6302111285,"Horror anthology films were popular in the late 1960's and early 1970's.  The best of them were made by Amicus and had stories written by horror masters Robert Bloch or Richard Matheson or were based on tales from the classic EC. comic books of the 1950's.  Tales That Witness Madness was an attempt to jump on that bandwagon but it has an original script not based on previously published material and the stories are terrible.  None are even mildly interesting and two don't even have pay-offs--they just end abruptly.

The first story involves a boy who has an imaginary friend that is a tiger.  The boy says the tiger is real but his constantly squabbling and neglectful parents don't believe him.  If you don't know exactly where this one is going very early then you aren't familiar with the classic Ray Bradbury story The Veldt.

The second story is a completely incoherent mess that has something to do with an antique store owner who appears to be sent back in time by an antique bicycle and an old painting whose expression changes.  I really have no idea what happened in this story.

The third involves a man who brings home a tree stump that looks kind of like a sculpture of a woman.  The man puts it in the living room.  His wife doesn't like it.  They fight.  That's pretty much the whole thing, although the writer does try to throw in a twist at the end of this one.

The fourth story is the weakest of the bunch.  It features two characters who are apparently supposed to be African even though they are white and have Japanese names.  This story goes nowhere and has no point and even manages to completely miss a potential twist (what happens if the human sacrifice isn't actually as innocent as she claimed)?

The wraparound story involves Donald Pleasence as a psychiatrist.  The main character from each of the stories is in his asylum and the doctor is relating each patient's story to a visiting physician.  Even the payoff at the end of the wraparound completely sucks, but that isn't likely to surprise you if you actually make it that far.

If you want to watch good horror anthologies from this period you would be much better off checking out Asylum, The House That Dripped Blood or Tales From the Crypt.  Tales That Witness Madness is nothing but a very weak imitator.",1401408000,2,2300,4.588235294117647

422836,4,6302111285,"I used to love watching Twilight Zone episodes, primarily because they were weird, featured incredible characters doing oddball things, and it was great entertainment. Tales That Witness Madness made me think of Twilight Zone.

The characters and the situations in this four-part movie-length story are quite entertaining. After the first scene I wasn't sure I'd like the movie. It was a good scene with a nice story line twist, but the blood splatter effect was very B-rated. The end-of-scene graphics, which were supposed to the be ""killer"" part weren't so killer. But it did do its job in building suspense.

From the first scene, however, it gets better.

I might have liked it better if it had simply been four stories that were all separate and not tied together. As it was, the scenes were held together by a scientific investigation that promised to explain the weird phenomena going on in each of the scenes. It worked as a device but only in a second-rate kind of way. The real meat of the film is in the four weird scenarios.

The film is a British-made project, which I found refreshing because were it not for the British accents of the actors and the credits I wouldn't have known. I'd have expected something more gory or sexually explicit for a British film. As it was, any American could watch the film and not find anything too objectionable. Of course, you have to like weird movies - and I do.",1363996800,,1413,4.685483870967742
422837,2,6302111285,"`Tales that Witness Madness', isn't that a great title!  Problem is it's the best part of the film. This is another of those horror anthology movies that seemed more popular in the 70s.  There are a few I really enjoyed like `Asylum'. I watch them hoping for more of the same.  This one seemed to have real potential with a cast that includes Donald Pleasence, Jack Hawkins,  Joan Collins and even Kim Novak. It's another example of how even a good cast can't save a dull movie.  The stories are predictable and even laughable at times.  It even seemed to me like a comedy spoof of horror anthologies.  The first story has been done way too many times. It's about a lonely child's imaginary friend that turns out to be all too real.  Then there's a story about a haunted photograph.  It made little sense.  The most laughable of the stories was the one with Joan Collins. She plays the beautiful and seductive wife of a man who is more in love with a strange looking tree he finds. Yes, I said a tree. He moves it into their living room.  Eventually it takes the place of Joan in the bedroom too. Talk about a wooden lover!  Yeah this dork actually picks a tree over his beautiful wife. The last film with Kim Novak was too disturbing.  Not disturbing because it's scar,y disturbing because I don't like to see bad things happening to good people like what happens to the innocent young girl.  Mr. Pleasence and Mr. Hawkins are used in the framing story about two Psychiatrists who are colleagues.  One claims to have made some sort of discovery.  That is the start of the stories.  The surprise ending to the framing story was also predictable. Still at least the finale was a bit scary. I give this movie a generous 2 out of 5.",1363478400,,1729,4.438095238095238

422840,4,6302111285,"This is a four-horror tale movie by Director Freddy Francis, the very same one who directed 1965's Doctor Terror, and then 1972's Tales from the Crypt. In my opinion, this later entry is not that good compared with his 1965 movie, yet these four stories would amuse you in terms of originality. Plus, you will get some of the early 1970s' British environment. This film departs from the two previously mentioned films in that it does not rely on a sinister character showing travelers about their gruesome immediate fate. Instead, the film features stories involving four inmates in the care of psychiatrist Donald Pleasance. Just in case some may care, you will have Joan Collins at her highest!!  Overall, a fine job and a must have for 1960s and 1970s horror fans.

Technically, a good to very good DVD transfer by Olive Films (Universal). The audio is in English and no subtitles are provided. Considering that no extras are on this this release either, you should try paying no more than 12 dollars for this one.",1360368000,,1017,4.7727272727272725

I'm especially partial to those starring Peter Cushing and Vincent Price, my all-time favorite horror actors.

I was able to watch Tales that Witness Madness via streaming and was happy with the quality of streaming (on Youtube). This is a 1973 British horror anthology and stars Donald Pleasance as Dr. Tremayne, a psychiatrist who talks about his new theory with his colleague Dr. Nicholas (Jack Hawkins) as he goes through the mental asylum where he works, and focuses specifically on four patients. This provides the framing device for four different tales, i.e. Mr. Tiger, Penny Farthing, Mel, and Luau.

Mr. Tiger tells the tale of a young boy with an imaginary friend, a tiger. As his parents' fights get increasingly dramatic and escalate, the imaginary friend begins turning corporeal. What will happen next? I did not much care for this story, finding it lacking in thrills and scares. In Penny Farthing, a young man finds himself inexplicably drawn to a penny farthing bike which under the glowering portrait of Uncle Albert transports him back in time. Uncle Albert's picture (portrayed by Frank Forsyth) is the star of this story and its malevolence is never in doubt. As for Mel, Joan Collins plays a married woman who gets upset over her husband's new obsession, a petrified tree that looks uncannily like a person! I rather enjoyed this story - Joan Collins plays the sexy wife role very well, but it is the petrified tree Mel that steals the show. The final story features Kim Novak as a literary agent whose virginal young daughter becomes the target of sinister plans concocted by one of her clients.

Some of the acting in this anthology is wooden and unconvincing, and I was surprised that Novak's performance proved to be lackluster and not very prominent despite her top billing (well, big star and all that). In fact, the inanimate characters proved to be much more interesting! The stories overall are OK, some being better than others, as is frequently the case with anthologies. This anthology is one of the weaker ones compared to some of the Amicus productions. Those looking for plenty of thrills and scares will not find it here. Still, it is worth a watch for those who like horror anthologies, especially of the old school variety.",1348099200,,2860,5.6287703016241295

My strongly held opinion is that reviews on Amazon should be for the *product*. In this case a particular Blu-ray. IMDB, and the like, are the place for movie reviews.

To often Blu-rays of obscure titles are taken from poor quality sources, or are even upconverted and sharpened DVD. This was clearly taken from a very good print. Quality is excellent, as you can pretty much expect from Olive. If you are interested in have the film on Blu-ray, this is a great opportunity to do so.",1513382400,,529,4.557894736842106
