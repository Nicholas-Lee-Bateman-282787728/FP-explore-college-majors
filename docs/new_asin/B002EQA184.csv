8368167,5,B002EQA184,"I'm a jazz musician.  One of my all time favorite tunes is AUTUMN LEAVES.  One day I was driving, on an errand and listening to one of our Seattle Jazz stations (KPLU) and heard this very different, yet awesome girl singing that song.  I damn near drove off the road!  I could not believe her approach to the tune...the execution was singular and heart-stopping.  I pulled over and called the station.  I was told that it was a singer by the name Eva Cassidy....from an album called Live AT Blues Alley, a jazz club in Washington, DC.  I immediately drove to my favorite record store and purchased the album, only to find out that she had died.  Her other songs are worthy of acclaim, but she ""OWNS"" Autumn Leaves!

8368168,5,B002EQA184,"Her short period of  life, and her limited regional atuation,
didn't cut her later recognition as one of most beautifull
voices; her repertory was, also, a jewell; like Rebecca
Pidgeon, Sara K., Linda Ronstad and mani others stars
she will continue shinning brigther as time goes on.

8368169,5,B002EQA184,This is an excellent reporting of the life and music of Eva Cassidy. Good information on her life and outstanding music performances.,1365811200,3,133,5.090909090909091
8368170,5,B002EQA184,"My only ""beef"" is that it's too short. If you want to know about Eva Cassidy, the incredible singer, pick this DVD up. It tells the story, and what a heartbreaking story. Of all the things to be taken down by, snuffed out by: skin cancer. Tough to accept. (She did not discover that she had it until it was way too late.) She had a lot to give. That voice, the voice was pure magic. I can't say enough good things about this singer.
Give her CDs a listen, and then get this DVD to find out more about her.
How did I come to know her music? My sister sent me Eva's Songbird CD and I was hooked, absolutely, thoroughly hooked. Went out and bought three or four more of them.
In a world full of ""singers"" she still stands out.
Every bit of my praise is warranted.",1365724800,6,760,4.073333333333333

8368172,5,B002EQA184,"...This young female left few recordings, and only one CD recorded locally in an event.  Yet, the family, in her last few months, carried her to the recording studio, and she sang her heart out, for the posterity of her family.  She knew she was dying from late stage bone cancer.  Though weak and diseased, she made this final attempt so that we all could enjoy her voice beyong her grave.  The albums I now own always lift me above my grief...her song choices are classic, and beautiful....the voice exceptional.  I treasure them, each and every one.

This TV spot from ABC News gave a deeper understanding of Eva's life, and her passionate heart expressed in her music.  I feel privileged to have obtained this DVD.",1315180800,11,718,4.650793650793651
8368173,5,B002EQA184,"ANYONE WHO WANTS TO KNOW JUST A BIT MORE ABOUT EVA CASSIDY will find this news story by abc wondefully insightful and to the point (after all they only have so much time in these segments). this well done report gives the viewer a glimpse into the brief life of one so incredibly talented (she was an amazing artist, too, though that's not covered here). it basically covers her short life (she died at 33), illness, death and rise to prominence afterwards. interviews with friends and family give it just the right quality and leaves the viewer wanting more. how she found success after her passing is the stuff legends are made of.",1310428800,4,633,4.610619469026549
