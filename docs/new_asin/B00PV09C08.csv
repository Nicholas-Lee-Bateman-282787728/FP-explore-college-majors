6822277,1,B00PV09C08,I found this movie while shopping and my first impression was that it would be really good. When i started watching it my opinion quickly changed. The animation makes me want to cry. It's really is terrible. The story line makes no sense and the acting is just plane terrible. If you are looking for a goofy cheesy scary movie then this would be a good choice. Otherwise stay clear.,1424908800,,382,4.4714285714285715

6822279,2,B00PV09C08,"It always baffles me how rarely Hollywood capitalizes on the love so many children and adults have for dinosaurs. They are a link to such a place of joy and happiness in our childhood that, if you are at all like me, never wavers and endures a constant source of amusement.  Though mainstream films mostly shy away from these incredible creatures there has been a rash of low budget filmmakers who seem to frequent this topic far more often.  With the fourth entry in the beloved ""Jurassic Park"" franchise, ""Jurassic World"", months away a film with the promise of dinosaurs running amok would be perfect for us chomping at the bit in anticipation for ""Jurassic World"". Enter the suspiciously similarly titled ""Jurassic City"".

  ""Jurassic City"" holds so rigorously to the formula of a Sy/fy Channel original movie that it is if it was created solely for this purpose and not the straight to video fate it received. In a style exactly like ""Poseidon Rex"" and ""Raptor Island ""( which premiered on the aforementioned station) we have a cardboard villain (Kevin Gage doing a cheesy, but generally fair, toned down rendition of the serial killer he played in ""Chaos"" several years ago) spouting the usual taunts and tired dialogue, the drunken College heroines required in nearly every film of this type and the security team who exists to shoot at the horrendously portrayed C.G.I. dinosaurs (the gunfire in the shootouts are equally cartoonish as these creature effects). These straight from the horror cliche catalogue characters( which stand as one of the many examples of the lazy, by the numbers screenwriting on display) could have been ignored if there was something unique about any of them or if the movie didn't descend into the usual ""picked off one by one scenario"" and went for something more fun, suspenseful or original.  Alas, none of that exists here.

  There is not to say there isn't a cheap thrill in seeing obvious computer effects chomp the heads and limbs off the one-note humans on display there. In fact, there were several moments when I found myself smiling at the distraction these beasts so many of us have adored since childhood would cause mayhem. The problem is that most of it was reserved for the last 15 minutes or so, given that most of the film is sadly one repetitive scene after another of characters yelling at one another in the prison complex most of this takes place in. This is a fatal mistake for the film for I kept hoping they would have a little more variety in dinosaurs besides the Raptors, and on occasion a Tyrannosaurus Rex (all of which still aren't shown very often),  than what we see her. That primary error is addressed near the last shot but it is too little too late (the cover offers a view more exciting than the movie itself can conjure up) and we barely get a glimpse of the dinosaurs loose in the city (outside of a domestic scene about a half hour in).

  It's meant to be silly, low rent entertainment you watch late at night when your tired and mostly forget the next morning. I understand that and it has its moments where it works in such a fashion but even at 89 minutes its not enough to really be satisfying. The first half is rather glacial and the title and story promise big things which never come. It's hard not too feel disappointment in this because of the promise on the cover. I've long learned that sometimes its good to be surprised and get something you don't quite expect but ""Jurassic City"" doesn't work not because it doesn't live up to his promise but because there's nothing here we haven't seen a million times before ,and in so doing, becomes the definition of familiar and routine.",1423958400,3,3671,4.681677018633541

6822282,2,B00PV09C08,"This isn't exactly the film described in the Amazon review or pictured on the cover. This review contains plot spoilers, but don't worry, the film wasn't that good. The 1,000's  of raptors and dinosaurs are not set loose on LA until the end scenes. That would have been a great film.

In this film, CG Raptors get loose in an LA city jail, because somehow that is where the military swaps Raptors. Exactly how and why the military has dinosaurs is one of those silly plot points that never need explaining. Three hot sorority sisters, a couple of  lesbians and a flake are in the ladies' side of the prison while a polite serial rapist and killer is on the guy's side. The prison doors all come open while 3 raptors bite off the heads of people. Regular automatic weapons don't seem to work, only large hand held cannons which can blow the Raptor's head off seems to work. Of course most of the military working with the dinosaurs have the automatic weapon.

Now I did like the characters we meet in prison. It added to what would otherwise be a boring CG raptor film.

Sorority girl: ""These are dinosaurs. This is a prison. I think we're a little out of our element.""

The film is Asylum grade, including the occasional gaff.

Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Some bikini shots. Heads torn off. Blood splatter on lens. PG-13 stuff.",1422662400,17,1334,4.533333333333333
6822293,2,B00PV09C08,The cover is misleading as well as some of the content in the item description.  It states -thousands of rampaging raptors are unleashed on Los Angeles. 95% of this film takes place inside a prison setting where 3 horribly designed dinosaurs chase a small group of people around.  It is not until the final 30 seconds of the movie you see a city filled with dinosaurs.  I have seen better dinosaurs in video games.  The dinosaurs in this movie are boring.  The acting is mediocre and I found myself thinking I wish I had not wasted the time watching this.  Some reviews indicated that some people loved it.  I definitely did not.,1440028800,,629,4.5625

6822299,1,B00PV09C08,"WARNING:  Ending Revealed.

I wish the 2 girls had died and the con and the prison administrator lived.

The con saved the girls lives many times and they repaid him by locking him out and almost killing him  The dumb guard jumped the con when they should have been working together and he did it BEFORE the door was closed when a dinasaur was after them.  The 2 girls  locked the con out after he knocked out the stupid guard.

The con even when he lived after the girls betrayed him the first time...should have RAN as he could easily outrun the girls leaving them behind for the dinosaur to eat.  Instead the con AGAIN saves the girls by letting the dinosaur eat him while one of the nasty girls he saves calls him names as they run away because he told them to run.

Bottom line:  None of the women were worth saving.  The men should have saved themselves.",1432339200,2,860,4.3125

6822304,3,B00PV09C08,"The cover illustration on the DVD case is an impossible promise to live up to.  This is a character driven story; the few dinosaurs seen are treated as being secondary, in spite of the fact that they are an integral part of the villain's diabolical plot.  The story begins in a secret facility housing dinosaurs in cells, in cellblocks.  One gets loose.  We get a brief glimpse of it before it is destroyed.  A shipment of more dinosaurs is on the way but the vehicle transporting them is diverted to a detention center instead.  There are only three of them and they soon get loose, rampaging through the place, making a mess of the control room, all the cells open and the prisoners make a run for it.  Trying to evade the dinosaurs becomes the primary focus of this movie.  At one point, it is briefly mentioned that this is a ""test run"" for something bigger.  Later on, in the dead of night, during a storm, there is a stampede in the city.  Judging from the ending, this is a setup for a possible sequel.  If not, then this was the biggest tease ever.

This is exactly the type of movie the Syfy Channel routinely features.  It could have been exceptional.  There is one brief shot of a pterodactyl flying overheard that it nicely done.  Unfortunately, it shows up far too late in the story to be of much use.  As for the rationale behind everything that happens, an explanation is given by the villain but it is so bizarre, so utterly insane, that it just comes across as stupid rather than a plausible strategy.

But.  I was willing to overlook the lack of acting skills, a believable plot, and the dopey dialog for the few times there was dinosaur action taking place.  I'm that desperate for a good dinosaur flick.",1428796800,8,1723,4.482315112540193

6822306,3,B00PV09C08,"The actors often seem goofy; but perhaps that is the point. The initial scene of a hapless security guard confronting a dinosaur sets the tone for the entire movie. The most puzzling aspect is why regular automatic weapons seem to have no effect on the animals. They are still blood and flesh, but bullets seem to bounce off the hide. Must be real tough I suppose.

For those of you who live in Los Angeles, you might find some locations in the movie familiar; apart of course from the obvious famous shots of the skyline. As an example, there is one clip at the start depicting a large cube of an office building. Used to be a Sears store in Alhambra, near Valley Blvd.",1428537600,,670,4.403225806451613

6822308,2,B00PV09C08,"Jurassic City (Back with a Vengence) DVD is a 2014 movie that might have originally shown on the Syfy Channel on TV - it certainly was never shown in theaters. Since this film features raptors (my quotation marks will be explained in a minute) and a T. rex and Pteranodons (the latter two only at the very end of the film,) this movie should more accurately have been called Cretaceous City. The silly plot is that a top-secret military compound is  breached releasing raptors to plunder Los Angeles! Seemingly ignoring this, the military sends a truckload of three raptors in to an L.A. prison to be kept in the underground parking garage there. Upon their (almost instant) escape, these mindless killing machines ravage the occupants of said prison--a prison which holds our stars; three sorority girls immediately sentenced to prison (not jail) the same day they accidentally back into a police car (wouldnt that just mean a traffic ticket?) as well as a few bad women and also men in the same prison. The plot (and I use the term loosely) also involves evil scientists, black ops military and a rapist/murderer, who the writers cant decide whether to make into a good guy or a bad guy! The supposeable Velociraptors have no sickle shaped claw on their feet and actually look to me more like a Monolophosaurus, but I think it best to just call them generic, theropod, Hollywoodsaurs. The acting is certainly not award winning but Ive seen worse. The CGI dinosaurs look fairly decent at times but then are strangely lit at others ruining the effect. The T. rex and the Pteranodon that decorate the DVD box cover don't even show up until the final scene of the film when the crazy director of the project releases them upon L.A. leaving an opening for Jurassic City 2, even though I was crying openly the words, no, No, NO!",1427587200,,1824,4.7
6822309,5,B00PV09C08,"I love dinosaur movies, and Jurassic City proved to be plenty of what I expected. So I expected a so-so plot. Wrong.  It goes like this: some crazy guy, played to the hilt by Ray Wise, is behind the breeding of giant raptor like creatures who escape a supposedly secure holding underground. Yes, they get loose and of course, wreak havoc and plenty of blood. This particular place is also a jail, and a killer, along with a mix of other men and women are involved as one-by-one, people are killed and devoured. The end result is a rather silly twist, but I didn't care. It was great fun.",1426982400,8,587,4.385321100917431
