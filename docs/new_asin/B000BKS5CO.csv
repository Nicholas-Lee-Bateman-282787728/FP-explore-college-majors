And so what is wrong with some cheap laughs anyway?

WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT: HAVE YOU SEEN A CIGARETTE AD ON TV LATELY?

Ever wonder how everyday things today might look in 3 or 4 decades? If you have --- then this video might interest you, as it does me.

What I found on ""Classic Sports Commercials From The 50's & 60's""

was an eclectic mixture of interesting, ridiculous and politically incorrect short video hucksterings featuring some of America's most revered sports legends of their day. There were video promos for 'Camel', 'Kent', 'Lucky Strike' and other cigarettes, extolling a pitch that went something like this, ""when I light up I want a treat NOT a treatment!"" Frank Gifford got off a dune buggy and lit up his 'Lucky Strike' and began extolling the benefits of that famous brand. Other legends suggested that 'Camel' was best, 'JUST ASK ANYONE'.

Mickey Mantle, Roger Maris, Joe DiMaggio [Mr. Coffee] and Hank Aaron show up as well, and to their credit they are promoting baseball games, Ovaltine, Karo Syrup and Mr. Coffee.

Continuing on the more constructive side, we had numerous promos pedaling 'Ovaltine' which seemed so good I wonder what ever happened to Ovaltine? Joe Namath drinks Ovaltine and so does Captain Midnight and Duke Snider [of the Brooklyn Dodgers].

BOTTOM LINE: WHERE CAN I CAN GET SOME OVALTINE? AMAZON PERHAPS?

I don't think I'll ever forget that 'Ovaltine' has 27 vitamins, minerals and other food factors that the federal government says we need every day and in their RDA dosages per serving.",1156636800,,1607,4.8786764705882355
