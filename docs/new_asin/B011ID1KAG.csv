7333200,5,B011ID1KAG,"My family loved this movie. I was very hesitant to purchase with so few reviews, but decided to take the risk. We all love music and even though that was a big focus of the movie, there were many wonderful underlying messages. Family, integrity, taking risk to achieve your dream were the things that made this a 5 star movie. There was a cheesy moment or two, but over all the acting exceeded my expectations. Thanks for a great family friendly movie.",1451433600,3,452,4.524390243902439
7333201,5,B011ID1KAG,"Great movie in all ways - story, acting, music.  I'm kind of a tough critic on movies but would definitely recommend this one.  Good entertainment for the whole family.  I bought the DVD from Amazon and plan to order more for family members.",1445385600,7,241,4.558139534883721
7333202,5,B011ID1KAG,"I saw this movie when it came out in the theater last year. It is a great story! Actors are unknown, but excellent! I plan to purchase several copies to give as gifts. Congrats to David Kauffman, my neighbor, Cindy Issacson, and all responsible for its success after being filmed in San Antonio, Texas! https://goodforthesoulmusic.com/about/  PS Cheyeene Jackson is not hard to look at either ;o)",1444953600,4,396,5.0
7333203,5,B011ID1KAG,"This is a GREAT family movie. It's very kid friendly. The music is really good. Kevin Pollack is terrific. And it's so nice to see Christopher Lloyd doing an indie film. The movie was produced and filmed locally in San Antonio, TX. You won't be disappointed!",1444089600,6,258,4.630434782608695
8724250,2,B011ID1KAG,"I watched this based on 14 Amazon reviews that said this was a great movie for the whole family. Not once did anyone mention that several times throughout the movie words like son of a...., ass, holy...., and others were said but stopped short of the full word. Each time this language was used the person had to put $ into a jar for swearing. People use Amazon reviews to buy things but also rent movies. I just wasted $12 & hope Amazon will refund. Im just thankful I wasn't watching with my whole family.",1532736000,,507,4.347368421052631

8724252,5,B011ID1KAG,"A truly captivating film. Well-written, entertaining, a cast of professionals who bring a lot of depth and warmth to their characters. The music is really good, the story engaging, and wonderful photography that adds charm and poignancy to the story line.  Cool original music. Incredible talent. Highly recommend this film! The very best of Indie Filim making!  Hope there is more to come from these filmmakers...",1516924800,,414,5.257575757575758
8724253,5,B011ID1KAG,"Great music, good story, the whole family would enjoy. Pretty straight forward, talented musician with good family and he has resigned himself to being the best father and husband that he can. Still the people who love and value him, know he is missing a great part of who he is, a song writer, story teller. Then its a well written, and heart felled "" Hero's journey as my collage creative writing teacher would have defined this movie. I really enjoyed it, just a good, well written tale of temptation, loss of self, core values, and the journey as it unfolds. I really enjoyed David Kauffmans well written music, and lyrics. Cheyenne Jackson is a talented actor as well as vocals. all around just a sweet movie, with great music, sung well, supporting acting good also.",1495756800,3,772,4.6838235294117645
8724254,5,B011ID1KAG,"This is an awesome movie..with great music by Cheyenne Jackson. I hadn't heard of him until I saw this movie but his songwriting and singing are great. It's a great film for the entire family. Even tho I originally purchased this movie on Amazon video, I want to get the DVD as well. (just in case I can't get the video to work properly.) For some reason, this is the 2nd time I purchased an Amazon video that continues to stop and start numerous times while watching.  This is such a wonderful movie and Cheyenne Jackson is TRUELY AWESOME in this role; I want to have a backup dvd so I will ALWAYS be able to watch It.",1486771200,3,619,4.245762711864407
