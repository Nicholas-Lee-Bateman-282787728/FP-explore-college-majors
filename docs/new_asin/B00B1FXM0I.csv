8560774,1,B00B1FXM0I,"The DVD consists of 6 shorts hosted unconvincingly by Veronica Ricci (Sideline Sluts: Cheerleader Confessions) who never appears as she does on the DVD cover...not even close. The six stories, more or less had the same people in them and they were acted in a camp manner with bad dialogue and no special effects or real horror. Scenes include pretend stabbing and Troma guts.

List of shorts: 1)Trendish  2) Baby Cakes 3) Bloody Hell 4) The Prom 5) The Caged Girl? 6) A Pain in the Gums.

Keep the FF button ready. Worth a hacker's punch if you don't.

Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",1473638400,,585,4.542857142857143

8560776,3,B00B1FXM0I,"I am glad to see the new generation of indie minds that TROMA has contaminated finally making their presence known. I loved the old TROMA stuff and much like those flicks these shorts carry that same demented theme of outlandish characters and unusual and outlandish stories of twisted lives. Low budget this tacky is such a treat to enjoy especially when the humor is so dark and witty.

Trendish is a hilarious off-beat short that is straight out of a hallucinatory dreamscape. It is a truly black comedy that is completely bizarre. This is a fun twisted little short film.

Baby Cakes is a strange and gross short film. There are some funny moments, dark but funny. I did enjoy the ""baby tamer"". He is hilarious on screen.

Bloody Hell is an unusual but darker story that makes absolutely no sense. ""Kids prospecting for oil in the middle of the woods in 2012 America?!"" That aside it takes a serious tone which allowed for a creepier story. Still it is a ""What The Hell"" short film that made no sense at all to me. I did like the voice over effect.

The Prom is another strange and off-beat short. It is filled with a lot oddities. It is twisted and funny.

The Caged Girl? What a twisted tale indeed. A story of obsession and relationships in bizarro world. Like most of the shorts in this anthology this one is totally TROMA. This is a love psychotic.

Pain In The Gums is a short that is weird. It is a glimpse into Psychoville. It is very out there and has classic Kaufman written all over it. It is gross and unusual and hilarious.",1437955200,,1540,4.443262411347518

8560779,1,B00B1FXM0I,"Here is a great example of misleading. This film was horrible in every way imaginable. The filmmakers spent all their money to get some former Penthouse Pet to do a few intros and forgot to make the film. The female lead is an obese guy in a wig and dress. they even had him do a shower scene. I guess that was their way of relaying their sense of humor but I was not amused. I understand that shooting on a shoe-string budget often leads to a lot of un-intended humor, but this was going to far. Nothing about this film resembled a horror film and was a poor example of indy filmmaking. There is no bigger supporter of indy films than me, but this was garbage and shouldn't even be for sale. Sorry guys, you missed the boat.",1411689600,,725,4.223021582733813
8560780,3,B00B1FXM0I,"Much better then the first one but it still is bottom of the barrel horror. The thing is, it knows it! if you like cheesy ultra low budget horror with hand made gore, no budget, horrible acting but tons of stuff to laugh at, check this one out. It's silly and fun. SOV style film.",1384560000,,280,4.109090909090909
8560781,3,B00B1FXM0I,"treasure chest of horrors 2 is a somewhat emjoyable little super low budget anthology, the wraparound featuring the always gorgeous redhead penthouse model Veronica Ricci hosting each segmemt with your goofy and trashy family is simple but likeable. The first segment is shawn c phillips ""trendish"" is not a good one more of a short that really belongs on youtube. Now the second segment Doug Waugh's ""baby cakes"" is probably the best segment of the whole anthology. Its fun,energetic and goofy as hell all in an extremely enjoyable way (which also stars shawn c. Phillips as a giant killer baby) the next segment is ""Alex Powers ""Bloody hell"" which is a slasher film that is very enjoyable for all the wrong reasons and features a murderous fat kid who eats oil and has ridiculously hilarious dubbing that has to be seen to believe. The next two segments are both by shawn c phillips and to be honest there not particularly good either and finally the last segment is kevin e scott's Pain in the Gums which another enjoyable one that is well directed by kevin e scott, which features a man haunted by his gums talking to him, its silly but pretty fun but for a micro budget indie horror anthology qhat can you expect, so all together at times one can say that treasure chest of horrors 2 can be seen as the ""shawn c phillips power hour"" the good segmemts outweigh the bad ones, so pop open a few beers and enjoy the super low budget goodness that is Treasure Chest of Horrors 2",1374451200,,1478,4.56015037593985

As someone that frequently supports independent movies, I do understand budget restrictions can mean lower production values but this is unacceptable.",1373328000,4,294,5.413043478260869
