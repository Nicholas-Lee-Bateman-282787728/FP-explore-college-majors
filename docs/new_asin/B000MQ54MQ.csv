2739032,4,B000MQ54MQ,"This film is terrific fun and deserves wider recognition.  Part period comedy, part swashbuckler, part slapstick, this film is wholeheartedly enjoyable.  Malcolm McDowell is terrfic as the cowardly hero of the Afghan campaign who is reluctantly recruited to pose as a Prussian nobleman.  Oliver Reed as Otto von Bismarck and Alan Bates as his Hungarian aide are also in top form.  As for the ladies, Florinda Bolkan and Britt Ekland are not only luscious but add to the comic mayhem.  My only quibble is Richard Lester's direction is not up to his usual high standards but, hey, you can't deliver ""A Hard Day's Night"" or ""Petulia"" every time out.  Interestingly, this was a period of great productivity for Lester.  During the space of a few years he delivered this film, ""Juggernaut"", and the two Musketeer films.  ""Royal Flash"" definitely falls into the buried treasure category.",1178841600,6,881,5.027586206896552
2739033,4,B000MQ54MQ,"A great satire of Victorian England and most especially Victorian era Hollywood movies. Lots of laughs in most unusual settings. Who would have guessed Bismark would make such a comic subject? Hard to imagine why this has taken so long to make it to DVD.  The only thing too disappointing about this movie is that it was the only one done to date from the immortal Flashman series, certainly Flashman in Afghanistan would be very timely and on target today, but at least the author Fraser and the director teamed up again on the Three Musketeer movies.  I'll be happy to challenge to a duel anyone who dares to question my devotion to the books as long as they allow my friend to load the pistols.",1173052800,30,697,4.523809523809524
2739034,5,B000MQ54MQ,"I saw this ages ago, and I still remember being in pain the next day, from laughing so hard! My ribs literally ached, but it didn't stop me from gathering half a dozen friends and watching it again. Everything about it is a delight!  Ironic, farcical, satirical comedy in the hands of masters.  Everything is a joke: there are sight-gags, musical jokes, genre jests, and the movie mocks even itself, as well as the movie it's spoofing (The Prisoner of Zenda). Superbly acted, masterfully directed, by the best who could be picked for the job. Wish they'd release it again, or at least distribute it on dvd!",1159920000,18,606,4.654205607476635
2739035,5,B000MQ54MQ,"Two great actors, Macolm McDowell (A Clockwork Orange, Time After Time) and Oliver Reed (Tommy) are at their best in this hilarious movie.  It's based on Otto von Bismarck's rise to power in Germany and a not-so-heroic English hero Thomas Flashman (McDowell).

Flashman, who gained fame after being found unconscious draped in the Union Jack, had actually been trying to tear it down to appease Afghani invaders.  The movie begins with his near escape from a gambling risqu house (in true Victorian style, the women daringly showing their petticoats).  After goading Bismarck into a hilarious boxing match in which Bismarck is beaten silly by one of ""the lower orders.""  Bismarck swears to remember Flashman as Flahsh laughs gleefully at the mayhem he arranged.  Later Bismarck lures and then kidnaps Flashman into posing as German count because the real one has caught ""Cupid's Measles"" and can't attend his own wedding.  In humor typical of the movie, Flashman is captured after the woman he expects to sleep with is replaced by an overweight stranger.  After momentary surprise, Flashman says ""well, since you're here,"" and proceeds with the task until stopped.

Flashman makes a hilarious cowardly hero as he barely manages to shine after a cowardly or vice-inspired act.  Particularly funny and original is the poking fun of Victorian morals.  The movie also has some good scenery, including and a beautiful segment with Wagnerian overture at the beginning of a hunt (""have the doggies found the boar yet"").  A great and underappreciated actor, Oliver Reed does an excellent job of the very serious Otto von Bismarck.  It's only too bad that more movies like this weren't made.  Flashman serves as the perfect anti-hero type that we so miss from the screen these days.",1159315200,22,1773,5.068965517241379
2739036,2,B000MQ54MQ,"Really not worth the effort to find it, even if George MacDonald Fraser was involved with the screenplay. The producers chose the ""least best"" of the Flashman novels to adapt, they cast the wrong actor to play the role, and they reduced the whole story to a bawdy, not-very-funny, slapstick comedy. Don't bother searching for it. True Flashman fans will be disappointed.",1153872000,22,370,4.983870967741935
2739037,3,B000MQ54MQ,"This is a pretty silly 70s film that is improbable, over-acted, full of OK action, and pretending to get into historical details.

The main character is Flashman, who is the bully from Tom Brown's School Days.  In his bumbling military career, he is lucky to be the sole survivor in a fort in Afghanistan, and is extolled as a hero when in fact he is an incompetent coward.  From there, he enters into a series of misadventures with courtiers, princes, and some historical figures, such as Bismark.  It is pretty fun, with sword fights, sex, and intrigue, but I never lost the feeling that it was all made up - I never got with it, suspending my disbelief even for an instant.  On the positive side, McDowell, Bates, and Reed give their usual fine performances, as do Ekland and Bolkan, both in their prime.  Unfortunately, the characters might be funny, but they are neither interesting nor endearing.  I doubt we will watch this again.

Recommended tepidly.  Rent, don't buy.",1424304000,,977,4.733727810650888

2739040,3,B000MQ54MQ,"Not anywhere near as good as the BOOKS, but that is common when movies are made - they appeal to the lowest common denominator (especially Hollywood junk) and most of the subtle elements that make Fraser such a delight to read are left out.  Slightly entertaining but minimal, and it does help to have a reading knowledge of the Flashman books, if one does not I'm not sure how one would find the movie - perhaps thats why only ONE Flashman movie has been made.",1418256000,,461,4.423529411764706
2739041,5,B000MQ54MQ,"If you've never read a Flashman novel, then you should.. McDowell's prose is delightful, Flashman is 24K scamp and the historical context is fairly accurate",1418083200,,156,5.28
2739042,4,B000MQ54MQ,"This is the type of film that really requires two reviews, meaning a review of it should start with an explanation of why it requires two reviews.

Harry Flashman began literary life as a bullying schoolboy who was the villain of the popular Victorian novel (and modern TV series) Tom Brown's School Days.  The character was adopted by Scottish author George MacDonald Fraser,as the anti-hero of a series historical novels beginning publication in 1969.  The motif is that Flashman, grown up, is as villainous as ever -- a coward, liar, and philanderer, among other faults -- who through extraordinary good luck embarks on an army career which covers him with glory for his supposed courage, honor, gallantry, and other virtues.  Over the course of these picaresque novels, Flashman meets most of the major historical characters of the Victorian age, as well as managing to be present at virtually every one of the era's major military disasters.

These books have a cult following, and people will feel differently about this film depending on whether or not they are fans of the series.  The film Royal Flash was made by major director Richard Lester and features an excellent cast, including Malcolm McDowell and Alan Bates, and can be recommended to all as a well made period comic drama, with lots of intrigue, romance, and derring-do. You don't need to have read any of the books to enjoy the movie.  Since the film, like the book, is deliberately based on The Prisoner of Zenda (the fictional pretense of Fraser's novel is that one of Flashman's adventures actually inspired the plot of the novel The Prisoner of Zenda,) fans of that book or of its subsequent film versions will find it has added interest.  So that's the review fon non-cultists.

For those who (like myself) are real fans of Fraser's Flashman books, I'd make a slightly different recommendation. The novel Royal Flash is often considered by aficionados to be one of the weakest of the series, and some may find that McDowell's performance as Flashman and Lester's whole treatment are a bit too light and comic-opera like.  But since this is, unfortunately, the only Flahman film ever made, fans of the novels will certainly want to se it, even if they find it somewhat disappointing.

I saw this on a Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment DVD which was of good quality.",1408320000,,2347,4.886649874055416
2739043,5,B000MQ54MQ,I have read all of the Flashman books and with that they had made more movies from them.  The movie is just fun!,1399766400,,112,3.869565217391304
2739044,2,B000MQ54MQ,After having read all of the Flashman's books I was excited to find a movie about Flashy. Oh how disappointing. McDowell is terrible.,1393200000,,133,4.826086956521739
2739045,3,B000MQ54MQ,A little dated but still a good laugh.  Some fine fencing  Perhaps a little crude at times.  Books are good too,1362441600,,111,4.190476190476191

2739047,4,B000MQ54MQ,".
Viewing this film on a stand-alone basis (i.e., without comparing it to the books), I thought it was a thoroughly enjoyable costume drama, similar to Terry Gilliam's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Adventures-of-Baron-Munchausen-20th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B0011E5M66/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (20th Anniversary Edition)</a>.

It is, of course, different from the books, which I think are masterpieces of dry British humor, as opposed to the vulgar slapstick so popular in America and imported into Britain by John Cleese and his ilk, and of which there is far too much in this film.

Still, a great way to relax after a long day at the office.

NOTE: One advantage enjoyed by period pieces is that they don't age.

After viewing the film, check out the brief biography of Lola Montez in wikipedia. An amazing woman.",1336176000,,901,6.015625
2739048,3,B000MQ54MQ,"I agree with the other reviewers that this was not a very good adaptation of GMF's work and poorly cast, at least the Harry Flashman role.
One point that has not been mentioned: there is no ending. The end is just left hanging in the air!! The end of the book is side splitting but simple. Elspeth simply asks Harry after all his adventures, ""what did you bring me back from the continent?""",1334620800,,390,4.3561643835616435
2739049,4,B000MQ54MQ,"The only movie made, to date, from George Macdonald Fraser's excellent series of novels -- directed by Richard Lester right after his ""Three Musketeers"" movies. Malcolm McDowell is a perfect Flashy, and it made me wish I was in the next universe over, where there were half-a-dozen more of these movies, and McDowell was prepping another one right now.",1303516800,,352,4.983050847457627
2739050,3,B000MQ54MQ,"I'm glad that some viewers like it. I did too, and after finally seeing it after so many years of trying, I am surprised at the terrible rap the movie has acquired. What's really missing, something that lends weight to the novels, I think, is the voice of the older, wiser, brutally honest Harry. Otherwise, what's to criticize? Sexy women, swordfights, scenery, costumes. And there is one really great turn: Oliver Reed as Bismarck. He deserved his own miniseries.",1217462400,4,465,4.89873417721519
2739051,4,B000MQ54MQ,"I guess I am one of the few Flashman readers who liked this film. I agree that Royal Flash is one of Fraser's weaker novels (probably my least favorite of the series), but I think Lester, with Fraser doing the screenplay did a good job. The two had collaborated to even greater effect with their classic adaptation of The Three Musketeers a few years earlier, and must have jumped at the chance to work again. It is too bad they did not start with the first novel, but I imagine it would have required a huge budget, whereas Royal Flash is mainly about personalities.

I thought Malcolm McDowell made a splendid Flashman. I think he looked the right proper Victorian gentleman/soldier, and he excelled at depicting Flashy as the craven poltroon he was. His opening monologue, as he tells the students to do their duty, while flashbacks show what a coward he was, perfectly depicts the character. I think McDowell even resembles some of the original cover illustrations for some of the paperbacks, and I sort of imagine his voice when I read the novels. I know Fraser imagined Errol Flynn in the role, but Flynn died in 1959, and his like has really not been seen in films since his death. Malcolm McDowell in his youth really specialized in playing smirking anti-heroes who seemed to have some depth underneath but really, they didn't.

I also liked the use of the Wagner music. The film is set (more or less) during the time Wagner composed in Bavaria, and I thought his heroic music was a good counterpoint to Flashy's cowardice. The supporting cast is a dream, with Oliver Reed (as Bismarck), Florinda Bolkan (as Lola Montes), Britt Eklund and Alan Bates. It is beautifully shot in Bavaria with authentic castles making it a sumptuous production.

What is wrong with the film? As many said, the plot is scarcely more than a rewrite of the classic novel The Prisoner of Zenda. So, there are few surprises here (though this treatment is decidedly bawdier). Also, Lester cannot resist""one joke too many"" in all the scenes, putting in as many sight gags and sotto voce mutterings as he can. What worked in A Hard Day's Night and The Three Musketeers seems like overkill in this film. The material was already witty and clever enough and did not need so much ""help"" from Lester.

As to the DVD itself: there is nice little feature that gives an overview of the character of Flashman, and how Fraser researched and wrote the novels, etc. There is a feature on adapting Flashman to the screen, and you can listen to the music score on an isolated track. I thought the picture looked a bit ""soft"", but that could be the way it was shot in the 70's, or else, they could not find better print material. However, it is more than acceptable.",1205971200,14,2732,4.626804123711341
2739052,5,B000MQ54MQ,"Royal Flash is more than just a slapstick romp with plenty of laugh-out-loud scenes.  It is that--but it's also a well-crafted and humorous look at history which can be taken at face value or viewed as a rather cynical commentary on the nature of power and fame.  It's a clever depiction of the possible (if improbable) backstory for Otto von Bismarck's rise to power by way of a sly retake on Anthony Hope's books, The Prisoner of Zenda and Rupert of Hentzau.  Instead of a True Blue Victorian Hero, you get an ignoble Victorian anti-hero.  Unlike many comedies filmed in the '70's, such as Altman's M.A.S.H., Royal Flash wears well and still has the power to make one laugh without being embarrassing.  It also still has the power to make a person think about the nature of politics and power without being unduly heavy-handed about the whole thing.  The film stands on its own.  You don't have to be a fan of George MacDonald Fraser's wonderful Flashman books to enjoy this film, but it's likely you'll want to read a few of them afterwards.",1198886400,7,1044,4.641304347826087
2739053,2,B000MQ54MQ,"I am forced to cast my vote with those who regard this movie as a failure.

To me, the film fails on two counts.  The first failure relates to the general approach.  How in heaven's name did G. M. Fraser, the author of the wonderfully amusing black comedy novels about that magnificent anti-hero of anti-heroes, General Sir Harry Flashman, come to write such a feeble, would-be action comedy and lowly farcical screen adaptation for this movie?

The other failure, and vastly the worse of the two, is the utterly appalling miscasting of Malcolm McDowell as Harry Flashman.  The Flashman of the books, a man who cheerfully admits to no virtues whatsoever, is widely admired as a staunch and true hero of Little Vickie's Empire entirely because he looks just like a hero ought to look.  Malcolm McDowell most emphatically does not.  He looks like ... well, Malcolm McDowell.

First-rate books, third-rate movie.  Too bad and two stars.",1195689600,7,933,4.89171974522293
2739054,3,B000MQ54MQ,"Simply put, this was not a very good film adaptation of the novel, even though author George MacDonald Fraser wrote the screenplay. Too, casting Malcolm McDowell (light colored hair/blue-eyes, 5' 8"" tall, and weighing 140lbs dripping wet) as the bluff rogue Flashman (black hair and black moustache/dark brown-eyes, 6' tall, and weighing in at 13 stone = 180lbs) was totally wrong. GMF said he thought Flashy should be played by someone like the late Errol Flynn ""...with his impudent swagger, athletic grace, and matchless style."" (Fraser's THE HOLLYWOOD HISTORY OF THE WORLD p. 54)  Perhaps Liam Neeson.

I was surprised that this was more of a Benny Hill type of slapstick and sightgag film, which accounts for it being a box office flop, than a  swashbuckling comic rework of the old Anthony Hope PRISONER OF ZENDA story. So many good actors gone to waste, except for Oliver Reed's performance as Otto von Bismark which was super. Perhaps I expected too much, especially after viewing GMF's splendid screenplay adaptations of THE THREE MUSKETEERS/THE FOUR MUSKETEERS.

I understand that the folks who filmed the SHARPE TV series are interested in doing a FLASHMAN series for British TV. I can only hope they do; hopefully, as polished as the BBC/HBO ROME TV series. How they'll get away with it right under the noses of the PC Police is beyond me. Anyway, don't waste your time viewing ""Royal Flash."" Read the novel instead.",1193702400,11,1428,4.96234309623431
2739055,3,B000MQ54MQ,"This film is an adaptation of the second novel (of the same name) of George Macdonald Fraser's Flashman series.  This film has some moments, but not enough to move this above a middlin' work.  There are just too many serious flaws.  First, and most importantly, the director and screenwriter tried to portray some of the bawdy, un-PC humor of Flashman with a campy, lighthearted style.  If you've ever read any of the  Flashman novels, particularly the early ones, you know what I mean when I say it would take a brave director in today's PC world to faithfully reproduce Flashy on the big screen.  The management team of this film took the easy way out and made Flashy into a comic book character.  Fraser himself was the screenwriter!  Second, the choice of Wagner to score the movie was horrible.  I think that this was an attempt to give the film a heavy German feel, but the effect of using music from the Ring cycle was totally misguided.  I would say laughably ridiculous.  Third, the Bismarck character came off as a quasi-Nazi `obsessed with his destiny' to unify Germany.  Fundamentally, the writer/director/produced failed to recreate the atmosphere and the `feel' of the Flashman novels.  There are several positives to this film. Malcolm McDowell, for all his other achievements (and this is far from his best film), was put on this earth to play Flashman.  He has the Flashy smirk, and can carry himself with the craven arrogance of old Harry Paget.  There are also several great scenes.  Flashy engineering a boxing lesson between Bismarck and the boxing champ simply to see Bismarck get pounded is particularly well done and hilarious (and true to Flashy!).  Florinda Bolkin does a superb job with the role of Lola Montez.  Bottom line is that this is a decent film, but it doesn't remotely do justice to Flashman.  If you think the Flashman novels are brilliant (as I do), you're going to be disappointed in this film.",1188086400,7,1935,4.79154078549849
2739056,2,B000MQ54MQ,"As a long-time fan of the 'Flashman' book series, I was pretty disappointed to see what a hack job had been done with this, especially when considering the high caliber of some of the actors used.  It is apparent throughout that a lack of money available for production, as well as a very tight filming schedule really hampered the final result.  But more to the point, out of all the many adventures of Flashman, why the heck did they choose this one, which is nothing more than a hasty 'rewrite' of 'The Prisoner of Zenda??' While amusing as a book (the charm of the Flashman series is that Flashman is always somehow involved in all of the major historical events of the latter part of the 19th century; think 'Forest Gump' with sex and fancy uniforms.  'The Prisoner of Zenda' has been done many times, so I can't think what the producers and directors were thinking of when they produced this, especially when they hoped that they be able to produce sequels!  Extremely bad planning, and a waste of a lot of quite brilliant material!  I can only hope that one day, another filming group will 'rediscover' Flashman and do the job properly!
