3044754,5,B0010028JK,"I bought Bobby and Brett's first shooting video and loved learning the secrets of shooting and scoring. The Hulls are one of the greatest hockey goal scoring families of all time and their insights are valuable to anyone looking to score more goals. (I'm currently 3rd on my team). This new 2.0 video picks up where the last one left off. (It's worth the purchase just for the out takes alone!) Great for coaches, teams or individuals like me looking to be a better sniper. I bought two and gave one to an Asian teammate who's currently struggling to find the net. I'm actually more of a passer than a shooter, but am hopeful that one day I can shoot and score like these guys. Thanks Bobby and Brett, you're the best!",1201046400,,718,4.446969696969697

8236449,4,B0010028JK,a little goofy in the editing but overall has some good pointers and tips from some guys who know a thing or two about shooting,1420848000,,127,4.12
8236450,5,B0010028JK,Great read.  Very helpful.  My son has and continues to get alot out of it.,1410220800,,75,3.933333333333333
8236451,5,B0010028JK,I think this covers all the types of hockey shots that I was trying to learn.  I think it's detailed and has lots of explanation on the technique.  I think it was great that Brett Hull was on the video and he demonstrated many of the shots.  I don't think I'll ever need another shooting instruction product.,1256342400,4,308,4.368421052631579
8236452,4,B0010028JK,"As a new skater and 41 year old novice at the game of hockey, I wanted a dvd that would help me better understand how to handle a stick, shoot and score. I wanted something that would teach me by showing me what to do.
This dvd did not disappoint. The delivery of the Hull's was excellent. The highlight clips throughout demonstrating shots from their respective careers was also a nice touch inspiring hope that I may aspire to!
The camera angles were also great and the limited graphics were a nice plus.
They did a really nice job of teaching and then demonstrating the skills involved with each technique.
The only thing I would want added to make this a 10 would be more instruction on the positions of your body, hands and feet. More slow motion shoots demonstrating the transfer of body weight and the proper position and rotation of hands and wrist. Multiple camera angles of the same shop might also help.
If you are already familiar with skating, hockey and shooting then you will gain a lot of insight from this as you may not need as much as instruction as I do. When the go into the more advanced shooting then you will certainly gain more.
Overall, I would highly recommend this dvd to anyone who is trying to improve and learn better shooting technique.",1241308800,4,1268,4.517391304347826
8236453,5,B0010028JK,"I liked Brett as a NHL player a lot so I was very pleased to see that he participated in this great instructional DVD. I don't know the first version that must already have been a sucess, but the current version leaves very litte room for improvement.
I play hockey for about 15 years now but the DVD still taught me a number of things I didn't explicitly know yet.
Believe it or not, just today I watched the section about slapshots in preparation for a game that night, and in the game I shot the cleanest top shelf slap shot goal that ever came of my blade. Could of course be coincidence, but I sure don't regret watching the DVD.

The only downside in my eyes is the playtime that passes very quickly. I'm sure they would have managed to fill twice the time, but maybe they are working on another DVD about other techniques.

My vote: Go get it, it's worth it.

8236454,4,B0010028JK,Great video to explain different shots in hockey.  Some tips I picked up that really helped.  Just great review too.,1236384000,,116,4.75
8236455,4,B0010028JK,"I do like this video a lot. It covers all the shots possible and is very helpful. However, some of the audio is rather poor, e.g. when they are demonstrating the technique, the audio of Bobby and Brett talking fades out as they skate around and I've had to turn the volume way up to hear it.

I also think they forgot to mention a couple of things, e.g. look up on the slapshot once you strike the ice. Overall though, very good. The audio has a few issues here or there but it's totally worth 20 bucks...",1235001600,,505,4.153061224489796
8236456,4,B0010028JK,"Enjoyed this immensely.  A must for any youth coach or player.  Very positive tips, well layed out, expamples are great, footage is outstanding.  Outakes are too goofy to stomach, but the techniques presented are well done and explained at a level that you can break them down and encorporate with your own teachings and comprehend as a young player over 10.  Well done.",1215907200,,370,4.825396825396825
8236457,5,B0010028JK,"I have played hockey since I was 4 years old and played through Junior in Detroit. Some of my fellow teammates, and some of my opponents went on to play in the NHL. I still play pickup on Sunday mornings and have also coached mite, squirt, peewee, bantam and midget. I wish 2.0 was around during my coaching days because Brett and Bobby Hull Jr. have produced the most valuable, professional and comprehensive shooting video ever. The Hulls have a clearly defined way of peeling away the layers of shooting, and describing it in simple terms so that novice through highly skilled players can understand it. The slow motion sequences are simply awesome! And I have to say the outtakes are a real hoot!!!

I bought this video and couldn't wait to get on the ice to give the Hull techniques a go. And you know what? I'm shooting the puck with more power and precision than ever. Even the guys I skate with have noticed the difference.

In my opinion, no one shoots the puck more purely than Brett Hull and this video demonstrates how other players can adapt his technique and 'rip' the puck as well. Kudos to Brett, Bobby and Bobby Jr. for making this video available to the masses. I just became a bigger Hull fan!!!",1201132800,4,1214,4.513636363636364
8236458,5,B0010028JK,"I took my two sons to Bobby Hull's Shooting Camp here in Toledo last year and they had a great time.  Bobby ran 4 camps in two days and my boys did the camp twice!  My youngest son Lonnie couldn't raise his backhand but after an hour with Bobby he was putting it upstairs.  We bought his old DVD and were excited to see he had a new one out.

DVD 2.0 is amazing!  It blows away the first one in a number of ways.  It looks great and the footage is awesome.  There is NHL footage of Brett scoring on all the teams he played for and had so many goals I've never seen before.  The instructional footage on the ice was very helpful as the camera follows Brett on the ice so you actually feel like you are shooting and scoring!

I highly recommend that ANYONE who wants to shoot better and smarter get this DVD 2.0 WOW!
