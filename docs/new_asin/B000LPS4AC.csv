8163306,3,B000LPS4AC,"Being a fan of Masami Kurumada's work, i had to buy this DVD as B't X has not garnered as much attention as one might hope. The episodes are very nice and follow the manga very well. The english dub and subtitles are however very horrible. There are many mistranslations and the name of the evil organisation The Machine Emperor is very inconsistent as it changes from Dominion to The Machine Empire and so back and forth. I would recommend this DVD only if you are a fan of B't X. Otherwise you are wasting your time as Ilumitoons never released the third and remaining planned volumes.",1365984000,2,587,4.4953271028037385
