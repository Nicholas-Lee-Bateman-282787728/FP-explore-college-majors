4216415,3,B003XF1UZI,This was an odd old British movie. But I enjoyed it.,1429747200,2,52,3.8181818181818183
4216416,1,B003XF1UZI,Not a great copy!,1419552000,2,17,3.5
4216417,4,B003XF1UZI,"Movie is a little chopped up and the continuity is not the greatest. I don't care what anyone says, this movie is certainly watching.
The ending is a complete  surprise, and one of the best surprise endings I've seen.",1416096000,7,217,4.564102564102564
4216418,5,B003XF1UZI,As described,1413676800,2,12,5.5
4216419,5,B003XF1UZI,"I love these old horror movies.  There are far too few of them.
Unfortunately, one has to watch a lot of movies that are boring, badly-written or otherwise difficult to sit through in order to find the few gems.
There are many viewers that would disagree entirely about my recommending this  movie a a gem; however, I will stand firmly by my statement....this movie is a gem in a sea of plastic!!!",1412294400,11,397,4.5
4216420,4,B003XF1UZI,"Old print, extraneous film sound but still great and nostalgic viewing. I can't believe I finally found it. Thank you.",1390780800,9,118,4.95
4216421,2,B003XF1UZI,"So forgetful, I forgot it. Low budget, including its ideas - black and white only imparts so much mystery - in this case, none at all.",1381104000,,134,4.1923076923076925
4216422,5,B003XF1UZI,If you are a fan of old creaky ghost stories then this is a must buy. The picture and sound are not the best but this is a rare film. WORTH EVERY PENNY.,1359331200,10,152,3.6363636363636362
8408080,3,B003XF1UZI,For a scare has a lingering effect. In black and white and scratchy film add to its effectiveness as a ghost story.,1474416000,,115,4.2727272727272725
8408081,5,B003XF1UZI,"Enjoyed it a lot. There's a surprise twist at the end.
Don't get this if you don't like black and white or
seeing Brit ghost stories which they say there
aren't too many of.",1471392000,2,173,4.117647058823529
8408082,1,B003XF1UZI,worst movie I ever watched on Amazon.,1470614400,,37,4.428571428571429
8408083,4,B003XF1UZI,"Hello. I hope this finds you well.
Here is a PRC (poverty row classic) film that has you headed in one direction but you definitely end up in another. There are some special effects in this film that while by today's standards look corny were probably quite breathtaking back then.",1468022400,,281,4.64
8408084,3,B003XF1UZI,"Obscure and hard-to-find British ghost story. Nicely done,though an over-familiar story in our era , compared to audiences in the 1940's. A minor but pleasant film.",1466553600,,164,5.346153846153846
8408085,5,B003XF1UZI,New to library have't seen it yet...have to get back to you...lol,1459296000,,65,4.5
8408086,1,B003XF1UZI,Horrible,1453507200,2,8,8.0
8408087,5,B003XF1UZI,wonderful,1441497600,,9,9.0
8408088,1,B003XF1UZI,Very disappointing....and I am a huge fan of 1939 - 1959 horror/suspense/mysteries!,1441324800,5,83,6.0
8408089,4,B003XF1UZI,A good ol' ghost story...worth watching if you like ghost stories. For some reason the storyteller reminded me of Raymond Massey.,1432339200,2,129,5.190476190476191
