5972622,5,B00F9VO8OE,Great group to listen too. Girls are crazy about these guys. I'm not complaining about the guys either. I love listening to their music and learning about them. How they got started and stuck together as a group.,1395964800,4,212,4.605263157894737
5972623,5,B00F9VO8OE,My granddaughter loved this because she said it had great facts and information on the band members. She said she loved learning how the boys become famous.,1426377600,,156,4.814814814814815

5972627,5,B00F9VO8OE,I started watching them on the X-Factor to where they are now and I am amazed at the talent as well as their ability to reach out with their songs to touch so many lives. I also listen to BSB and they played a huge role in the songs that were a part of bringing my girlfriend and I together. Now we both listen to BSB & 1D and it's pretty cool how even after a disagreement we can still love either with the passion of when we first met 15 years ago. The secret to loving each other so long is bringing new and continuous fresh things that we both enjoy to the relationship. Well it works for us. Hope it helps another couple out there. Just don't get stuck in the same routine each day. Thank you for taking the time to read this.,1418860800,,731,4.013698630136986

5972629,2,B00F9VO8OE,"My daughter loved it but quite frankly, fell asleep during the middle of it. It was sort of boring to me. I don't really care to hear who hooked up with which 1D band member.",1409270400,2,174,4.0

5972631,2,B00F9VO8OE,"This disc follows the band ""One Direction"" on their ""Take Me Home"" tour. I don't know their music at all but had the chance to check out this DVD. The band seems talented enough even though they seem to be one of these boy bands thrown together to generate as much cash flow  as possible from the young teeny bopper girl set. They all have dastardly good looks and seem so nice you just want to hug them. I am not a fan of these types of group but millions of young girls (and I'm sure guys too) love them so I won't knock them.

The problem with this DVD is it is so incredibly topical. It won't be relevant by the time this review is out. It is about what they are doing NOW. Who they are dating, what kind of good things they are doing, where they are playing on this tour, etc. It is done in the style of those shows where they have commentary by so-called experts such as comedians, newspeople...you get the idea. This one uses ""industry insiders"". I find that format annoying.

I didn't care for the gossipy feel to this DVD. I think I could enjoy watching a real concert by these guys though as they do seem to have talent. I believe any tween who loves boy bands will enjoy watching this disc once, but then it will be on to the next big thing. I'm sure this one will be available for cheap real soon because of how time sensitive it is.

Check it out if you like the behind the scenes and gossipy stuff but aside from that I would try to hunt down an actual concert from these guys. You will get far more and lasting enjoyment out of that.

5972632,5,B00F9VO8OE,Perfect for any 1 Direction fan. Both of my daughters loved this dvd. If you have a 1 Direction fan they will enjoy it.,1399420800,,119,4.0
8613518,1,B00F9VO8OE,"Rubbish. Boring. Documentary, long-winded. Same video clip-age over and over. New continent was mentioned (Astralashia) and lyrics were mentioned wrong. ""This Is Us"" is a much better- Much Better- film of 1D (5 out of 5 stars). I would have put 0/5 stars for this movie but that wasn't available. So bored by the end.",1502236800,,317,4.781818181818182

8613526,5,B00F9VO8OE,The documentary was very enjoyable and very interesting.  The difference about this boy band is that there isn't a lead singer.  They all  very talented singers and can hold their own.  Not to forget that they all very nice looking guys.  It would be if they could remain close.,1429660800,,278,4.591836734693878
