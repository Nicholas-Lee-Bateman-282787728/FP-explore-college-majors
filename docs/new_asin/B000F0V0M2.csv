2547468,2,B000F0V0M2,"""Krypto the Superdog"" is a great show that hearkens back tot he enjoyable cartoons of the 80's.

The problem with this dvd release is that is a major rip-off with a misleading label.

The dvd states clearly it has ""5 TV Episodes"" and in the back ""Color/110 mins."", which implies 5 actual episodes. That however is a complete LIE. In reality these are actually 5 episode SEGMENTS (each episode had two segments, each about 10-12 minutes). So really each dvd has 2 1/2 episodes, running a total of about 55 mins..

The ""5 episodes/110 mins."" fact would only be true if we take both Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 together.

Now the segments are in order, so we get:
Vol. 1:
-""Krypto Scripto Part1"" (episode 1, segment 1)
-""Krypto Scripto Part2"" (episode 1, segment 2)
-""Super Flea"" (episode 2, segment 1)
-""A Bug's Strife"" (episode 2, segment 2)
-""Meet the Dog Stars"" (episode 3, segment 1)

Vol. 2:
-""The Streaky Story"" (episode 3, segment 2)
-""Diaper Madness"" (episode 4, segment 1)
-""Feline Fatal"" (episode 4, segment 2)
-""Dog-Gone Kevin"" (episode 5, segment 1)
-""The Dark Hound Strikes!"" (episode 5, segment 2)

So one buys two separate dvd's just to get five episodes.

Now, the series had 39 episodes, which means that in the (highly unlikely) chance that Warner Bros. continues releasing these, it will take some 16 volumes (at about $6.60 each, coming to over $100, about as much as I paid for the ""Real Ghostbusters"" complete box set, which had three and a half times as many episodes)!

I doubt Warner Bros. will keep releasing these, which is a shame as it is a very good series. But to do these ""trickle"" releases is not good. To lie and mislead buyers is intolerable though.

2 Stars, for atleast the series had some sort of release.",1321228800,4,1731,4.630718954248366
2547469,5,B000F0V0M2,"My 5-year old son loves this cartoon, and Volume 1 is a perfect first choice to see how the story begins.  The service with Newbury Comics through Amazon was terrific.  The DVD arrived in a timely manner and well packaged.",1265414400,,222,4.525
2547470,5,B000F0V0M2,"We happened across this program one Sunday on TV.  Kids really liked it, but apparently show was no longer in syndication. They enjoy watching the super-hero dog, Krypto. I'd rate it G.",1212451200,,185,4.78125
2547471,5,B000F0V0M2,We caught some older episdoes of Krypto and recorded them on Tivo for the kids and they loved them so much that we had to buy some on DVD.  THEY WON'T LET US PLAY ANY THING ELSE!  Please put more episodes on DVD  and SOON!!  We love the story lines!,1211068800,,249,3.92
2547472,3,B000F0V0M2,"Krypto proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that Paul Dini's brilliance cannot be contained even by the strict rules slapped upon writing children's programming.  Fans of his previous DC comics character works (Batman & Superman the Animated Series, Justice League, etc.) need to realize that Krypto caters to children between the ages of 4 and 8.  And while it is certainly a step toward simplicity when compared to his prior works, the entire series really isn't far off from what Hanna Barbara was putting out all though the 1970s and 80s.

Especially noteworthy is the 2 part debut episode which not only reveals Krypto's origins, but sets up the rest of the series very effectively.  Expect a cameo from Superman himself (and Lex Luthor in later episodes).

The animation is clean and colorful with its own unique look to it and the voice work is quite impressive.  My only compliant about this set is that $12 is a bit steep for how little is actually contained on the DVD.  Five 12-minute episodes can be breezed through in a single sitting.  While I realize that children have shorter attention spans and probably appreciate the slim episode running times, Warner would have been wise to throw at least ten episodes on this disc so parents feel they got their money's worth out of it.",1180310400,,1289,4.748878923766816
2547473,5,B000F0V0M2,Krypto the Superdog is a really good way to get the younger kids to love super heroes from the start. The whole show has the perfect technique to appeal children and hook that super hero lust for life. It's a masterpiece!,1153958400,,221,4.414634146341464
2547474,4,B000F0V0M2,"This show is trully classic, Paul Dini (writer of the well known Batman, Superman and Justice League cartoons) is part of the project and it shows. Unlike the shows mentioned earlier this show is for young kids, however it is written very well that an adult can sit through the episodes and enjoy them. The whole show feels retro, fromt he theme song to the episode splash. The show so far has also gotten development and keeps getting better with a big cast of supporting characters, from his owner Kevin and Ace the Bathound (batman's dog) all the way to Streaky the cat and the Dog patrol.

However, since the show is aimed at young kids, so is this dvd, with only 5 twelve minute episodes, it hardly feels worth it, hopefully it'll get some better releases later as this is a great show.",1150848000,6,791,4.493055555555555
2547475,4,B000F0V0M2,"These are excellent retro-style cartoons, perfect for young children.  If you are looking for Superman/Batman style entertainment for your kids, without all the explosions and fights, then this is it!  My four-year-old loves Superman's dog, and my two-year old loves Streaky the Cat!  I would give it five stars, but 60 minutes is pretty skimpy if I'm going to take up space in the DVD cabinet.  The first 30 minutes is already marketed on a DVD that comes with Krypto's Rocket Toy. (Which my son, Krypto's #1 fan, already has.)  Any fan of Superman will enjoy seeing that his dog Krypto has finally gotten the spotlight he deserves!  Krypto was actually in many of the Superman comics of the 50's and 60's.  The stories are well written, and targeted to young children.  The animation here is top-notch, and may remind you of ""the Jetsons"" cartoons.",1150675200,5,850,4.813793103448276

You might think I wanted to be Supergirl because she was brave or smart or pretty or cool or Super but you would be wrong to think that. I wanted to be Supergirl because Streaky was her Superpet!!!!When I heard that Cartoon Network was making a Krypto cartoon I was excited; When I heard Streaky would be in it I was elated!!!
This show is fun!!Watch it!!!",1147910400,5,486,4.236559139784946
