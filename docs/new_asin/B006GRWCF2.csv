4987434,5,B006GRWCF2,"Nothing in this documentary is new. However, it puts it all together in one place, which is overwhelming and powerful. I find it interesting that other reviews more or less say only liberal females like this DVD. There is nothing right or left about this documentary. The point is that America and the West are not as advanced as we like to thing we are when it comes to issues of gender. Men should also appreciate this documentary since they are as effected by negative images of women as women are themselves. I suspect that people who find no worth in this documentary are either in denial or part of the problem themselves. Even if you do not agree with every point presented, it should provoke thought and respectful, important conversation about representations of women.
One negative point- the story of being pregnant with a girl was annoying and unnecessary.",1334793600,13,868,4.793333333333333

4987436,1,B006GRWCF2,"This movie is a bunch of bunk. Women are their own worst enemies and until women change and stand up for each other and stop pushing Hollywood as the ""standard"" to our daughters, we will continue to go backwards. Moms and grandmothers and fathers  and the church, should all be teaching self-worth to their  daughters and their sons and not some movie filled with actresses who say one thing on screen yet live a hypocritical lifestyle off screen. I could never recommend a movie of this type to anyone.",1334188800,16,503,4.640449438202247
4987437,2,B006GRWCF2,"My daughters were recently shown this movie at school and the parents were also invited to a screening. The movie was good in that it reinforces the idea that women are more than the sum of their body parts--even though the media portrays women that way.

 Various scenes of women in hyper sexual roles are shown (Angelina Jolie, Jessica Simpson, ect.).  I kept waiting for the documentary to lead into the fact that women don't need to take these roles (especially ultra wealth celebs!) and that we have the power and integrity to value ourselves.  I just couldn't believe that there was no mention of personal responsibility.  Literally, the media was blamed for all our moral decisions concerning our sexuality!  I was so disappointed.  Also, the movie seemed very outdated in that it really never mentioned internet media--my daughters don't even watch T.V. and movies--it's all computer.  Maybe the idea of online cencorship of porn was too controversial to take on?

It is nonsense to think that a college girl who strips for quick money or a celebrity that takes hyper sexualized roles will change their value system because the media changes. It can only work the other way around!

I wouldn't call this a documentary.  The creator, Jennifer Newsom, is married to ultra liberal Gavin Newsom. It shows.  Politics are frequently mentioned in the DVD and when a movie becomes obviously liberal or conservative you can't call it a documentary! Pushing for women to be in power positions definitely comes before family and children in this DVD.  That makes more sense when you consider that Newsom is extremely wealthy, has a nanny, and lives in a celebrity environment.  I am not judging her for that, but it's not real life for a lot of us! Some of us would prefer to be stay at home moms, if at all possible, and teach our daughters about personal responsibility.

So the media, like this video shows, needs to change.  However, women need to change first.",1331856000,37,1962,4.8293413173652695

In 2010, women are better represented on television, in movies and in the news media than they have ever been in the past. However, while this increased visibility had led many believe that women have achieved something like equality, the truth is women have a long way to go before they achieve anything close to parity, as women count for only seventeen percent of elected officials in Congress and seven percent of working directors of feature films. Actress turned filmmaker Jessica Congdon Newsom studies the obstacles women face in the media and the stereotypes that still define them in the documentary Miss Representation. Featuring interviews with noted figures in politics (Nancy Pelosi and Condoleeza Rice), broadcast news (Katie Couric and Rachel Maddow), television (Margaret Cho and Lisa Ling) and movies (Geena Davis, Rosario Dawson and Jane Fonda), Miss Representation explores the glass ceiling that many women in the media still struggle to break and the double standards applied to women in terms of appearance and persona.

4987440,5,B006GRWCF2,"I initially saw this film at the SF Film Society's showing, and as a teacher, felt it was important to bring along a few parents, students, and former students.  My only regret was in not bringing guys along, who should most definitely see it as well.  What struck me most profoundly was the momentum that was growing so quickly back in the late 60's and early 70's, and the backlash that appears to have driven us significantly backward ever since.  As a parent of a young woman in communications, the statistics on who is running the media was quite shocking.  My group left the theater profoundly impacted, and I immediately requested that our school librarian order a copy.

Over the Christmas break, I watched it 3 more times, once with my daughter and twice with ""mature"" women, and everyone was riveted by the movie.  While it can be argued that this topic has been addressed numerous times over the years, it needs to be repeated in a variety of venues and formats to increase the consciousness of all of us.  It is easy for those of us who grew up in the 70's to think the momentum kept on, when in reality, it has not.  It is also alarming that young women have grown so accustomed to being objectified through the media, this would come as a surprise how manipulated they really are!

The highly respected people and experts are often used to punctuate the sensationalist, and often less substantiated, statements of less-qualified persons, as well as it features images clearly selected for their shock value. Thus, this film becomes an example of one of the very culture trends it ridicules, namely employing shock over substance. Near the end much of this shock becomes male ridicule, but here again the stronger statements are delivered by the sensationalists and then punctuated by more moderate and respected speakers.

4987503,1,B006GRWCF2,"Back in the early 90's, I worked as a volunteer at a college radio station. And during my 3 years there, the ratio of men to women held steady at around 10-to-1. If you were a hysterical and paranoid feminist, you might look at that data and leap to the conclusion that we were an example of the sinister male patriarchy in action, and were excluding women from our ranks, either by deliberate choice or by creating an atmosphere that women would find hostile and uncomfortable.

And you would be dead wrong. It was a very safe, progressive, and PC environment there. And we went out of our way to get more women involved, often wondering aloud why the women at our college were so disinterested in their college radio station. And my example is certainly not unique. Go to just about any radio station, college or commercial, and you'll find a similar gender disparity.

Is it because we're perpetuating the sexist, patriarchal oppression of women? Or could it be something much more benign? When this film rattles off lists of all the industries where women are underrepresented in leadership, it, like so many other modern feminist propaganda pieces, doesn't even consider the second possibility. So I'll have to do that for them. Here goes:

Newsflash - Men and women are wired differently. Thus, men and women often have both different interests and different life goals. The reason there were so few women at our radio station is simply because women in general are less interested in working in radio, just as they're less interested in careers in math, computer science, engineering, construction, etc. They're also less interested in corporate or political leadership. Nobody is preventing them from entering these fields or holding them down once they do enter. Not anymore. The days of the ""glass ceiling"" are long over. As Hanna Rosin pointed out in the Atlantic back in 2010, ""while female CEOs may be rare in Americas largest companies, they are highly prized: last year, they outearned their male counterparts by 43 percent, on average, and received bigger raises.""
And polling shows that when women do run for political office, they are actually more likely to win than men.
http://www.people-press.org/2014/05/19/for-2016-hopefuls-washington-experience-could-do-more-harm-than-good/

And - this is very important - men and women look for different traits in potential romantic partners. While women are attracted to men who are the most powerful and successful, men aren't attracted to those traits in women. No, men aren't ""intimidated"" by successful women, they just don't care either way. Thus, there's little to no pressure on women to make the most money or reach the highest status. So, for example, if a woman reaches her 40's and is not yet financially secure, she's not considered a ""loser"". But a man in that situation is. Men are under a tremendous societal pressure to achieve economic success that women just aren't.

And who is putting that pressure on them? Other men? Nope. Women are. Women hold the cards here. For as long as women continue to be attracted to men who hold power, while being turned-off by men who don't, men will always face a pressure to reach the top of their chosen industries that women don't have to face.

But even in spite of this lack of pressure, women are doing great! They've made huge economic strides in the last 40 years, often outperforming men in several fields. For example, among single people under 30 in urban areas women make 8% more than men!

And that whole 77 cents-to-the-dollar wage gap myth has been completely debunked.
http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/21/barack-obama/barack-obama-ad-says-women-are-paid-77-cents-dolla/
Rosin points out that ""According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, women now hold 51.4 percent of managerial and professional jobsup from 26.1 percent in 1980. They make up 54 percent of all accountants and hold about half of all banking and insurance jobs. About a third of Americas physicians are now women, as are 45 percent of associates in law firmsand both those percentages are rising fast.""

Yes, the film includes interviews with several individual women in media who related their stories of unfair treatment by individual men. I don't doubt their veracity. Some men are still pigs. But they are not the norm. And individual personal anecdotes do not constitute a valid argument about larger societal trends. Particularly when a mountain of evidence shows the opposite trend.
(on a related note, see ""Tinder Experiment Proves Most Men aren't Jerks"" at
https://www.yahoo.com/style/tinder-experiment-proves-most-men-are-kind-of-110725185323.html )

OK, but what about the film's arguments about the harmful effects of sexualizing women in media? Most of the stats the film uses to support it's arguments are in fact bogus. See, for example,
http://www.centerforinquiry.net/blogs/entry/miss_representation_and_the_importance_of_good_statistics/

But perhaps the biggest lie in the whole film is the assertion of ""increasing violence against women"". To the contrary, rates of violence against women, in all it's forms, has been steadily falling over the last 20 years.

Never mind the fact that men are far more likely to be the victims of violence than women are. That doesn't fit the narrative. BTW, countless studies demonstrate that women are as physically aggressive, or more aggressive, than men in their relationships with their spouses or male partners.

For the most part, the entertainment media doesn't lead, it follows. The media, for better or worse, simply gives people what they already want. This film tries to argue otherwise, but fails miserably.  If people didn't want to watch sexual images of women, they wouldn't. Ratings would suffer, and the media would replace it with something different. And there are always plenty of alternatives for those who don't want to see women sexualized. (this is one of the few areas where the ""free-market"" Libertarians actually get it right)

No one is being exploited or oppressed when some women choose to bare their bodies. They do it because they want to. Either for the paycheck (so I guess they're ""exploiting"" men's wallets?) or because they enjoy being ogled. Usually both. If other women feel pressured to achieve that ""unrealistic"" beauty standard, then good! A little bit of societal pressure to eat right and exercise isn't bad. After all, with our skyrocketing obesity rates, we sure could use it. And don't think that men don't feel that pressure too. Just look at all the late-night infomercials telling us how to get six-pack abs. And when was the last time you saw a fat, out-of-shape action hero? Yet, somehow, all those images of skinny half-naked supermodels haven't kept Adele from being the most successful singer in the world recently. Nor have they kept Meghan Trainor from joining her at the top of the pop charts. And, as everyone knows, more girls are now attending and graduating from university and college than boys. Why would they be doing that if the media was convincing them their only value is sexual?

And while it's true that men are not as valued for their appearance as women are, they are valued for equally superficial and potentially dehumanizing reasons. To quote Karen Straughan, ""If women are objectified as ornaments, then men are objectified as appliances"". And yet people still comment on men's looks all the time. In fact, in harsher & more judgmental ways than with women. Think of how often Michael Moore or Chris Christie are made fun of for their weight. No one thinks it's sexism. If anything, when it comes to criticisms of their appearance, the media treats women with kid gloves.

The problem with a film like this is that it teaches women to hate and resent men for an imaginary ongoing ""oppression"". And it tells men they should feel guilty for activities that are completely innocent and victimless (enjoying/appreciating images of sexually-attractive women). But I agree with the filmmakers on one thing: There aren't enough women in power. I've always argued that the world would be a better place if women were equally represented in positions of power. They truly are underrepresented at the top. So the film ends by asking ""How do we change it?""

For starters, you can stop blaming men and an already extinct ""patriarchy"". Instead, you should work to change what motivates women. It's not men's fault that so many young women hold on to the fantasy of a ""prince charming"" to ""come and rescue them."" It's not men's fault that many women would prefer to be stay-at-home moms. It's not men's fault that most women prefer to date men who are more successful than they are, and expect the man to be the primary breadwinner before they'll consider him as a serious mate. Change those realities, and then you'll start to see the desired change at the top.",1424563200,6,9299,5.39022711631108

There is a powerful thread about the bad influence of marketing & media on young women and this is the one that I tell people about but it also pushes a strong message that seems popular with well-educated, middle-class feminists: ""we want more seats in the corporate board rooms and in Congress"".  This latter message is too narrowly focussed; hard to believe that most women care about this.  Worse; when women try for these ""seats of power"" they have to behave more like men: aggressive, pushy and playing the 'male game'.

News flash... men go through the same stereotypical indoctrinated garbage. The reason why men don't feel it as much as women, because it is rarely brought up as the ads, media etc on women are. Men aren't reminded constantly that they should rally together to go against the men for the male enhancement commercials, or going against the guys for the Old Spice ads, because the men chose aren't realistic looking.

Also this self worth and value starts at home, not society and far away from media exposure. I find it strange that this film focus more on media and not home environment. Why? I'm brought up in this media craze society yet I don't suffer such feelings of inadequacy based on appearance. I have more criticism over myself on my inability to learn like everyone else due to my learning disabilities and because it is a constant reminder within the household.

I hate it how these documentaries only singles out one group or type of women. What about interviews in the point of view of women with disabilities? Or... maybe ALL women with disabilities are incapable to have the same problems and worries as ""normal"" women or women without disabilities? >_> In that sense, this film seem to agree and practice the same stereotypes and assumptions and expectations as the society it is trying to ridicule against. Somehow this film gives the feel of ""a pot calling a kettle black"" scenario. It only focuses on the general population of women which based on this documentary are ""normal"" women with no actual problems other than feeling like garbage because they don't look like the fake over-digitally created women in magazines and other popular media coverage. God forbid any of these ""normal"" women have a cognitive, intellectual or physical disability(ies)... I truly wonder what effect these women would have if they get struck by a disability or disabilities, they possibly will commit suicide. Anyways the last thing I worry about in my life is whether or not I measure up to the fake digitally created women in the ads. I guess that is why I find the information of this film irrelevant. I usually tell women who are lawyers, doctors, politicians, and other respectable professions that feel inferior because of how they interpret their own appearance... at least you don't struggle with learning disabilities, at least you don't have Down Syndrome, at least you don't have Autism, at least you aren't blind, at least you don't wake up every morning stating ""Try to be normal today... try to be normal today... please."" and hope you don't ever make simple mistakes that people without disabilities never do or make, but you do because of your disability(ies) gets in the way of total normalcy. That is something all these social documentaries on womens' place and value in society are lacking humongous.

The only complaint I have about the documentary was it spent too much time talking about Hillary Clinton and Sarah Palin.  The many clips from Fox News and Morning Joe started to feel more like a political statement and Fox bashing than a impartial documentary (I felt this and my very anti-Fox news).

It's so ingrained in our society to sexualize women like ""That one's hot, that one's disgusting,"" even if you're talking about athletes or politicians or comics or musicians. They're out there being ambitious and talented, but because they're female, people tend to only care about their sex appeal. And if they're not incredibly hot and putting it out there, you won't see them on the covers of magazines. Same rule doesn't apply to men. For some reason they're interesting no matter how they look, and fully dressed. We don't notice it's happening constantly and we don't realize how damaging it is to the status of females trying to do things in the world. It minimizes and degrades them in the eyes of the public so it's harder for them to be taken seriously. It's heartbreaking. The most under-adressed prejudice in our society is against women.

4987562,2,B006GRWCF2,"- What I liked: Bringing to light sexism in media.

- What I didn't like: NEARLY ZERO content in regards to ""what you/we/I can do"" except for a smattering of high school children monologuing while the credits roll and 120 seconds of the women-mentoring-women conference.

- Scattered thoughts and observations: While watching this film I was continually struck by the fact that there was very little depth into the topics brought up. By this I mean we would watch 15 seconds of the Jerry Springer Show (not a strong piece of evidence for their thesis) then 10 seconds of Jersey Shore (again, poor evidence), then you'll see Angelina Jolie's bare back, jump to talking head, jump to nuclear explosion (yes, I'm serious)...for a 60+ minute documentary, I was not expecting their evidence to be presented in ""Twitter format"" and felt that it was a disservice to the effort.

- I also question the validity of what one pundit called, in reference to many warrior women in films, the ""Fighting ****-Toy"". This was meant to illustrate that even as a warrior, the woman is still judged by her body. And the film implies this to be different than how men are portrayed. But I can easily think of many films in which the male warrior is presented in the same way (Casino Royale, Commando, Fight Club, etc). The pundit also ignores examples of warrior women who are not depicted sexually (Kill Bill, Mulan, Sarah Connor, Yu Shu Lien, etc).

And herein lies some truth that goes untouched in this film - humans are a visual species. So we should expect it as a result of evolution that men and women want to see naked men and women (dependent on individual persuasions, of course) while we consume celluloid violence. After all, in the media's opinion, if it worked for Shakespeare's drooling proles it can work for us.

- I was also disheartened by how little this film actually empowers women to rise above the ""one size fits all"" media message. I don't think there was a single mention of individual responsibility or personal power until Condi Rice remarking that Sally Ride didn't wait for there to be a First Woman in Space before she strove to become the First Woman in Space (and that was maybe 4/5 the way through the film).

In fact, I was shocked that this film seems to silently imply that women cannot help but feel as though they cannot strive to be more than just eye candy because the media has convinced them of that lie. For those of you who may not be familiar, this is nearly the same tactic that was tried in the US Supreme Court when activists tried to ban pornography because the porn industry has fooled their actresses into the profession and ""women cant be expected to know any better"". Call me crazy, but if you are going to make a documentary about women and sexism, you should probably focus on how women can rise above the mediocrity that media saddles them with.

- I've never been a Trekkie, but I did laugh out loud when they aired the portion of the high school girl's interview where she cites the recent adaptation of Star Trek as a sign of sexism in media (I'm guessing that she was referring to the skirts but I don't know for sure since the film cut to something else as soon as the girl finished that sentence). Yes, the skirts were short (see comment above about evolution) but I seem to recall that O'houra seemed to be a plenty empowered woman. Maybe the girl should have watched the original Star Wars instead - then again, she'd probably focus on Leia in the gold bikini and ignore her being a Senator, Warrior, Statesman (Statesperson?), Rebel leader, Jedi, and telling Harrison Ford off every chance she got.

- As much as I wanted to stay away from politics in this review but it would be difficult not to address another weakness in this film. When it comes to politics, the film suggests that no matter how qualified, a woman will always be judged and derided by her looks and that men do not face the same level of esthetic scrutiny. This is a very naive point of view. Take as evidence that when polled, viewers of the first televised presidential debate felt that Kennedy won while radio listeners felt that Nixon carried the victory. Why? Because Kennedy LOOKED BETTER. He was tall, younger, better looking, more charismatic, and had that winning smile. Compare him to his dour, chubby, sallow faced, and sweating (yes, sweating) opponent. The lesson learned: if you are a man and you want to get into politics, then LOOKS MATTER.

I could also point to the coverage of Chris Christie's weight, or when opponents of Schwarzenegger, during his term as Gov, took photos of his aging, out of shape, and haggard shirtless body at the beach in an effort to shame the former body builder. ""It's politics"" they said; no one thinks it is sexism until it is a female politician who's body is being remarked upon.

I'll end all this by saying that the over all subject of sexism in media is a real and dangerous phenomenon, but this film does very little to aid in this fight beyond screaming that ""WE HAVE A PROBLEM HERE!"". I'd have been more satisfied if the 2nd half of the film was focused on what you and I can do about it.",1388361600,11,5161,4.575757575757576

4987572,3,B006GRWCF2,"This isn't a bad film, but for the first hour there were as many naive and unfounded claims as there were actually made points. Particular props to eeina Davis, Condi Rice, and Jennifer Pozner (who has a book I now need to read) for consistently nailing solid points -- without them, this film wouldn't have held together. Surprisingly absent from the interviews were Sigourney Weaver and Janeane Garofalo, both of whom are comfortable with cameras and can run solid and sophisticated points on issues.

After an hour, this documentary wanders to the periphery of its focus to tap media literacy and then pay lip service to ""what does modern manhood mean?"" which is unfortunate given the body of work it left uncovered.

The territory that is left uncovered is where Ariel Levy -- also not interviewed in this film -- went in Female Chauvinist Pigs: women as a demographic reinforce this nonsense as a social norm. (Levy didn't get into power relations a la Foucault, but FCP was still a better read than watching this film.)

There are two massively undermining flaws in this film: First, minorly, for all the critiquing of make-up culture, most all of the women interviewed are clearly made-up for the camera -- some far more than is suitable for the critique being laid out. (Kudos to Rachel Maddow for looking less made-up than TV-usual; it reinforced the sincerity of her position.) But more critically is that, not content to tell you how bad media is, this film actively subjects viewers to sustained barrages of the trash it complains about. It bemoans hyper-sexualized advertising and shows the hyper-sexualized advertising it's bemoaning, somehow missing that The Advertisement Exists to be Seen regardless of context. If you already know enough to want to avoid that kind of garbage, then you may want to avoid this movie, too: it will overdose you on the garbage you're trying to avoid.

In a strange bonus irony, the film rails Angelina Jolie as an image, ignoring the work she does in impoverished nations particularly for women exactly as Lisa Bloom -- also not interviewed -- documented in Think! when she (Bloom) railed against misrepresentation in the media. (I prefer Levy's work from an academic point of view, but Bloom's book is also good and more inspiringly practical than this film.)

Still, if you're an ordinary movie-and-TV watcher who will be surprised by the junk you're consuming, this film may be for you.",1379721600,6,2437,4.934146341463415

Makes me worry for my future children and the kind of media forces they'll have to endure day after week after month after year.
The question of equality of Women is a civil rights issue that has plagued society since the beginning. It is mentioned in the film how women are seen as the wife or mother figure, and therein their duties begin and end. Not only is that appallingly cynical as a social view, it's basically a slick fib meant to hide a worse truth. If a woman who works wants to start a family, she's punished for it. The pressure to avoid having children is everywhere in the economy. According to those in powerful positions, employees starting families is the opposite of an economic advantage. You can see this in how we have no mandatory paid maternity leave in this country, or nanny services, or even paternity leave. The conditions are enormously hostile to couples starting families here in the US, but it's aimed at punishing women.

4987577,5,B006GRWCF2,"Some incredible facts that shocked me. (Watch the documentary for yourself to get the exact percentages. I was too riveted to stop the movie and take notes)

Before the age of 7? an equal number of boys and girls happily declare they want to be president. By the teenage years, this number changes drastically, not in the girls' favor. Somewhere between 7 and 13, girls are taught that politics is for men.

American ranks like 90? as far country with percentage of women in government. We're way behind. The numbers of women in our gov't compared to the population on women contained within in the United States is appalling.

In this case, who is representing us? WHO?

Men.

And just what do they know about women's issues? An even better question, why are we letting them control our lives?

Also something that really struck home for me as I watched this is...how we're being taught that the most important thing about a woman is her looks. We are to look sexy. We are to strive to be those women on the cover of magazines, in movies, on the runway. Everywhere we look...women are sex objects and sadly, many women who claim they are empowered--Angelina Jolie as Tomb Raider, Halle Berry as Catwoman...they claim to be empowered, but really, they are--like the rest of us--just striving to please men's ideal idea of a woman. They're half naked and stick-thin, tits hanging out of their clothing...How is that empowered?

We are taught to look sexy and we are taught what sexy is.

What this documentary told me:

Everything is airbrushed. The thin model, they still take a few more inches off before they make the ad. They narrow down the cheekbones, erase a few blemishes...it's all computerized and what we're seeing is not real, so when we strive to look like these women...we are struggling to obtain an impossible goal because that woman does not exist.

This results in depression. According to this documentary, in 2010, more than 50% of women in U.S. suffer depression. And it is because we continue to strive to be something impossible.

And men...we can't place all the blame on them. While we are taught through movies, advertising, and Hollywood that we should look computer perfect, it also teaches boys that that's what they should expect from us.

Something else I thought was cool was the comparison of women in movies today to the women in movies in the 30s and 40s and the roles they were allowed to play. I wonder...when did it all go wrong? When did women begin to oppress themselves again?

And that's all I'm going to say...this is a documentary that I highly recommend ALL women watch. It's powerful, it's sad, it's truth.",1377648000,3,2651,4.724511930585683

I would love to see PBS run it/promote it.

The only way to stop the current backlash to the significant progress that females have made over the past 50 years or so is to show the present group of young people that they are being heavily enculturated (and I don't think brainwashed is too strong a word for it) into believing that females in our society are to be valued only for their youth, beauty, sexuality, and service to males. For their part, males must take responsibility for their behaviour, stop doing it, and then speak out any time they see it occurring. Females must stop denigrating their own sex by allowing themselves to be presented in a highly-sexualized manner, and stop playing into this whole idea that being ""popular"" with, and desired by men is the number one goal in a girl's/woman's life.

Most importantly, we should be teaching that ALL people should be respected for their intellect, capabilities, passion for the things they do, in addition to their attractiveness, for that is a healthy view of an individual; reducing ANY individual to nothing but a sexual object, or a collection of holes, is NOT healthy, and indeed, is very deleterious to our society.

 to argue that  the culture today victimizes women, through early programming and continual assaults by the profit-driven products that are to being touted to enhance the BODY and SEXINESS of the female while ignoring her true brains and personality. This ""victim"" view is only part of the problem however.  The film seems to ignore each one's  ability to achieve and reach for success from within themselves.  A gift of non-bias in  the system/culture would set a stage, but  women must still perform from their own inner belief in themselves (listen to Sheryl Sandberg and her book Lean In).  Staging and performance are BOTH important. This documentary does bring attention to the issue of gender focus and programming of girls and women.",1363478400,,832,5.0661764705882355

It definitely covered some very important points that I totally agree with, however,I think it may have missed it's own point a little bit. They seemed to only talk about how bad it is that women aren't in power positions (which is valid), but they never considered that some women don't work, and stay at home with their children instead.
Also, be warned: I think there was more near or mild porn in this than I'd accidentally come across on the internet in the last five years.

With only 17% of TV and 9% of films made by women, the film shows how we are mislead daily by stories told primarily thru the eyes of men (I love men, but 80-90% of stories told by men is just not a good balance). As a journalist, I look for every opportunity to promote women leaders and entertainers. I covered a military documentary movie screening with 200 Marines in the room, and then chose to highlight the only female producer in my story and video. One of the most important messages in this film is that women have to support other women for this misreprentation to change. After hearing Geena Davis, Jennifer Siebel Newsom, Gloria Steinem, Pat Mitchell, Barbara J Berg and Jim Steyer speak 2 yr ago at Sundance about this documentary, it just made watching this film even more powerful.

BUT, nonetheless it is riveting to see what the media ACTUALLY does in its true nature of practice. I have shown this to my women's group and they absolutely love it. I would recommend this to EVERYONE - man and women, old and young!!",1358380800,,443,4.414634146341464
4987616,5,B006GRWCF2,"I watched this documentary a few days ago.  It's a film that I would describe as ""thought-provoking"" (an overused term, I know...but I use it discriminately).  It brings to light some very relevant issues that we, as a nation, should be discussing.  My initial reaction to the film was a sense of frustrated anger.  The problems highlighted in Miss Representation are so overwhelming, so pervasive in every level of our society, that they seem insurmountable. And what do we do when faced with a seemingly insurmountable dilemma? We blame.

I blame.

First I wanted to blame Men as a whole--for their shallow values, and collective persecution of the opposite sex.
Then, I wanted to blame the Feminists of the 1960s and 70s--for their botched and misguided effort to equate two fundamentally different entities: man and woman; an endeavor that began at the peak of this nation's most prosperous time, and one that I believe has done far more harm than good.
Then, I wanted to blame the Collective Media--the entity that, after all, is directly responsible for spoon-feeding our nation the destructive ideology highlighted in the film.
Then, I wanted to blame My Own Generation--my peers who seem so eager to not only consume, but to proliferate the myths that they are being fed.
Then, I wanted to blame The Younger Generation--our nation's bright adolescents, teenagers and college students who (by way of one recent historical game-changer that we all know as the internet, and the subsequent explosion of social media as a veritable way of life) have inherited and embraced a powerful new platform--a platform with the potential for global impact...but who seem to be rarely employing their unique birthright as anything other than a tool that serves only to exponentially magnify an already monumental problem.
Then, I wanted to blame Myself--for my own passive and informed acceptance, my willingness to ""go with the flow"" despite the fact that the current of that flow runs in direct opposition to everything that I would like to believe about myself as a girl, a woman, a mother, and a moral human being.
I stopped my pity party just short of blaming God.
Then I threw all of my make-up and fashion magazines into the trash and toyed with the idea of shaving my head and becoming a Buddhist recluse.

And then...

Then I watched the film again.  You should watch it too.  At the very least, watch the trailer. This issue is important--on a local, national, and global level.  It isn't a ""girl problem"" or a ""woman's issue"".  It isn't a condition caused by one gender or the other; nor is it a problem inflicted onto one gender by the other.  I am afraid, but I am hopeful.

I am afraid for us all as a nation, but even more so, I am afraid for my children...my three spirited, joyful, strong young daughters.  They are young now, and that youth provides some shelter.  But I know that their time is coming.  I suspect that it will happen slowly, but inevitably.  They will start to change.  They'll question themselves.  They will sacrifice the most essential parts of themselves in an effort to fit in with a society that is taking a dangerous path.  My daughters are unique individuals, and their reactions will probably vary; but there will be changes.  Flat irons and designer purses might replace archery sets and puzzles on a Christmas list.  A confident hand, once so eager to shoot into the air in a classroom might instead remain motionless on a school desk, stifled by the fear that ""smart girls"" aren't cool.  A favorite outfit, once worn confidently and with exuberant joy might be thrown away with no other explanation than, ""It makes me look fat, Mom"".  And if they still don't fit in, they may sacrifice even more. This is what terrifies me the most.
I am afraid.

And yet...

I am also hopeful. This problem can be solved.  The capacity of the human mind is staggering, and the connection between the mind and the heart is undeniable.  People are capable of greatness.  We can change course.  I hope that upcoming generations will look back at this time as a collective bump on the road that has ultimately led mankind to a more enlightened, self-aware, authentic human experience.  I hope that my children can find their way without losing too much of their essence...I hope that my daughters can raise their own sons and daughters in a nation characterized by a different climate, in a world with more love, and less fear.

And, yes, I did take my make-up out of the trash can. And I opted against shaving my head...for now.",1357603200,32,4549,4.761479591836735

I can understand why including some footage of exploitative media might serve to illustrate the problem, but 'MR' seems compelled to periodically fill the screen with over-long sequences of women doing the very things 'MR' decries.  I got the feeling that the producers felt the need to 'keep things interesting' and inserted a bunch of provocative footage to keep the audience engaged.  God forbid we just see people talking about the problem.  Better yet, why not have most of the inserted footage showing positive women role models?

Thus an ideal of impossible beauty is set up for them, causing them to feel insecure in their own bodies. Second, the media does not cover stories about powerful successful women, or have many movies or shows about them.  Instead, on reality TV and on fiction TV women are represented as only seeking the right man, not a career, or being jealous and mean to other women, or being lame-brained and ditzy. Third, there is no limit to how degrading to women media images can be these days.  Absolutely everything totally demeaning to women is broadcast over cable networks.

Anyone can cherry pick images and come up with any conclusion they desire about what the media is conveying to us. Sadly, there is a message here that is worth sending to young women, who we must not let fall victim to ridiculous pop culture expectations of what they should look like.

American media collectively create a false image of what men and women should be.

Girls, boys, men, and women are taught to invest their energy into mirroring what media portray as happiness, love, sexuality and success. However, these images are not grounded in reality, and trick us into believing that we too can become happy by buying clothes, makeup, and fitting in.

Everyone who compares theirself to media ideals of wo/manliness ends up disappointed.

Anyone who is a woman in the US, loves a female (daughter, sister, mother, wife, girlfriend, friend), or is a man that's aware of how damaging these biases / stereotypes can be to our minds (and our country) ... should see and support this film. Actually quite entertaining and enlightening. I highly recommend it.

In my opinion, while we as Americans love to preach to other countries about the importance of educating girls, treating them humanely, and how much more strong their economies will be as a result... we don't seem to be looking in the mirror much at what American media says about our true values.  I doubt that most people I know believe that TV, movies, commercials, magazines and/or newspapers reflect our values.  Do you?

While we as adults get to choose what we watch from what is available... do young girls and boys have the same wisdom?  Can any parent truly control what teenagers and preteen kids see when they're not at home?

Media literacy should be stressed in curricula for both children and adults, but unfortunately--even though Americans are exposed to more media now than they ever have been--it's often overlooked.

This film presents a great introductory look into this problem, and is a great starting place for anyone interested in media literacy--as we should all be.
