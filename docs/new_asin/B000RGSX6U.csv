8200633,3,B000RGSX6U,"This movie represents a mid class, yet entertaining Spaghetti western, when you rate Lone's films as first rate. This film was originally directed by Italian director Edoardo Mulargia in 1967, and starred by Ivan Rassimov  (U. Lenzi's Deep river savages) as Cjamango. This movie works well with a pretty simple story. Two ranchers and their gangs dispute a gold pot win by Cjamango during a card game. The film is fast paced, with some of the characters (the little boy) reminiscent of Leone's A fistful of dollars, with lots of shooting, and a pretty good gun down near the end.

Technically, the DVD transfer is a good VHS quality by Creative World Promotions. The film transfer is PAL, region free (not region 2 as indicated), and comes in widescreen format. The audio comes in either English or Spanish. No subtitles are provided. The movie runs for 86 minutes.",1421539200,,865,4.837837837837838

8200635,4,B000RGSX6U,"I prefer my spaghetti westerns dirty, windy, violent, atmospheric with nasty villains and tough, 5 o'clock shadowed antihero. That's exactly what I got with Cjamango (those Italians sure know how to come up with bizarre character names!).  It's a clich cheaper version of the Leone classics but that's exactly what I wanted.

To know what kind of spaghetti western your in for it opens with our anti-hero in a bar who get's challenged by a Mexican to a game of poker. The Mexican's partner says ""Wait, you can't do that. Half that gold is mine"" and then the Mexican shoots him!  That my friend is the kind of violent spaghetti western I love.

Starring Sean Todd (Ivan Rassimov) as Cjamango, this violent western has Cjamango win that gold from the humerous opening scene only to get it stolen from him. When Cjamango steals the money back, two gans go on the rampage to find him. Of course it ends in a clich shootout at the end.

Not the most strong plot but for fans of Leone's ""Man with No Name"" Trilogy, this will suffice as a cheaper clone.

Wild East's DVD is decent though the transfer is not as good as most of their efforts. The picture does look particularly blurry on a high definition TV (not to mention the picture is not anamorphic). But for a $14.99 price tag you cannot beat this.",1241568000,9,1297,4.521367521367521
