8460819,3,B0057JI16O,This is a great documentary. As such I give it 5 stars. Unfortunately this german edition does not have any subtitles where Russian is spoken and since the english soundtrack is not dubbed (as in the german sound track) you will have to understand Russian to know what the russians are talking about. Sigh. It is still interesting so I still gave it 3 stars. Be warned...,1380326400,,371,4.552238805970149
