8202559,1,B000FC2HPE,"I teach Russian art and thought this might be a well-organized narration of the painters, their bio, works etc.
The paintings were mostly NOT synced with the narration and perhaps that would have been tolerable if there were captions underneath the paintings. Very disappointing,to say the least, since there are no other videos on the subject.",1399766400,,344,5.160714285714286
8202560,1,B000FC2HPE,"I was thrilled to have the DVDs but disappointed in lack of narration about each painter. I had expected a detailed historical account of each painter's works and the context within which painter's works were set, historically, culturally, politically.  Very scan information and lack of narration made this collection much less than desired.",1330300800,,342,5.452830188679245
