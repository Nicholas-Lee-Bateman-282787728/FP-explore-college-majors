3735988,5,B001ORA2BU,"Abraham's words reminded me of the carefree, joyful attitude I held as a child regarding food and body image.  During my early years, I was eating all the time!  I would scarf down prosciutto for breakfast and order escargot at restaurants (I was only 5!), yet I remained slender, active and healthy.  As I got older, the upstream thoughts of those around me began to affect my attitude , and so I began to gain weight and lose the joy I felt for eating and for my body.  Thank you Abraham, Esther and Jerry for helping me let go of those resistant thoughts and bring back those good-feeling vibes I haven't felt for over 20 years.",1237939200,12,631,4.413793103448276
3735989,5,B001ORA2BU,"This is another powerful DVD from Abraham-Hicks.  Sort of a ""best-of"" the many answers they have given about health, eating and body image and the vibrational basis for different body-states, this DVD is for everyone, not just people wanting to be slimmer than they are.  Of course, Abraham says they only have one answer, and the longer you hear that answer the more obvious it becomes that there only needs to be one.

They just keep getting better and better!",1233446400,12,462,4.75

8331268,5,B001ORA2BU,A no-nonsense approach to looking at Weight Loss.  Very Motivating and thoughtful and a video that you can watch over and over again for inspiration.,1246233600,3,149,4.96
8331269,5,B001ORA2BU,"I've watched this a few times, and each time I get bits of new information I hadn't caught before.  I have a lot of Abraham-Hicks books and CDs already, so was worried that this would be repetitive, but it is very fresh information and it's all totally focused on weight loss.  It is also a LOT of material--10 different people with Abraham on 2 disks, and each one is the information presented in a slightly different way.

The material is not about dieting at all.  There are no diet tips, such as drink a lot of water or eat a lot of small meals, etc.  Some of the topics they do talk about are appreciating where you are now, appreciating your body, so that you can move forward to what you want for your body; also, finding a way to love food and not make food the enemy; and the basic Abe tenet, find a way to be happy and other things will come to you.

Highly recommended.",1245542400,6,880,4.208333333333333
8331270,5,B001ORA2BU,"I have heard about Abraham over the years but really knew nothing about what Abraham Hicks actually transmits.  (I am a fan of Byron Katie and Eckhart Tolle and EFT.) I LOVED this DVD set so now I am a fan of Abraham Hicks. Upon watching the first 15 minutes or so I was a little disappointed with how ""out there"" the material seemed to be but was WAY more than happily surprised by the rest of the program. Perhaps I just got into the flow. A lot more than a weight loss conversation. VERY valuable information and guidance that just seems to make perfect sense. Ah, the relief!!!! Will watch again and again.",1241395200,9,610,4.350877192982456
