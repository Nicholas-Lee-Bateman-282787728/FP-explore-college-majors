8275595,5,B0019X421A,The product was in the condition I expected. It was a gift so I am not sure what to say about its use.,1393459200,,102,3.4782608695652173
8275596,4,B0019X421A,"Let me begin by saying that Barry is my favorite living pianist, with Roger Kellaway and John Campbell running close seconds.  I've heard a LOT of Barry in clubs, and he always blows me away. If you are only hoping to hear Barry play piano, pass this one up. But if you would like to watch Barry's marvelous interactions with students, you'll enjoy this DVD a lot. And, of course, if you're a musician, you'll enjoy it even more.

I've bought nearly all of this series of Master Class DVDs, and found them to be very interesting. Some have a nice taste of the guest artist playing, some do not.  I'm NOT a musician, nor do I have any significant musical education, but I'm a long time jazz listener. The introductions, mostly by jazz historian and writer Gary Giddins, are also well done.",1322438400,11,788,4.496503496503497
