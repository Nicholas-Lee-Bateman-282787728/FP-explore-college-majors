2388818,4,B000AGTQ4U,"I found a Silver Screen Series DVD that appears to be a combination of 5 and 6. It was on sale for $2.99 at Movie Stop. I was not expecting much, but I was hoping that the quality of ""Life With Father"" would be better than the 50 Classics Mill Creek Version. It was a less than sharp technicolor version on that DVD. Here it is in black and white and only marginally sharper than the Mill Creek version. However, the fine quality of the other films made up for this disappointment. ""The Southerner"" and ""Behind Office Doors"" are certainly worth the price. ""The Southerner"" is a beautiful film by the great French filmmaker Jean Renoir in the ""Grapes of Wrath""/The River genre. It is quite moving, lyrical and beautiful. ""Behind Office Doors"" is about a smart secretary who tries to remain pure when faced with lots of 1931 big city temptation. It is a very sophisticated comedy with lots of surprises and a great performance by Mary Astor. If you've only seen her in ""The Maltese Falcon,"" this movie will really show you what a great actress she was. These are two lost classics with quite good transfers. ""Lady of Burlesque"" and ""Of Human Bondage"" also have good transfers from good prints.  It is a much more enjoyable experience watching them here than watching them on the 50 Classics DVDs.",1301788800,16,1294,4.6017316017316015
2388819,3,B000AGTQ4U,"Just to give you some content details. I thought this was a documentary on Barbara Stanwyck but it's actually four films, only the first of which features Stanwyck: Lady of Burlesque, which has multiple versions available on single DVDs anyway. The other films are Of Human Bondage (with Bette Davis) which again is widely availble, The Southerner (starring Zachary Scott) and Behind Office Doors (starring Mary Astor). Cover picture features Stanwyck and Davis.",1130976000,35,462,5.342465753424658

8078404,5,B000AGTQ4U,"Bette Davis and Barbara Stanwyck knew how to act.  Sad that Hollywood (or wherever films are now produced) hasn't thought of these wonderful actresses and the impact on movie viewers.  I'm quite old, but I have all the memories of these great actresses, and, thankfully, have DVDs of their films and time to watch the great movies in which they acted.

8078409,4,B000AGTQ4U,"If you are a fan of Barbara Stanwyck, Bette Davis or Mary Astor, this is a great buy. It is a group of four classic movies. Three of them, I personally enjoy over and over again. The fourth movie called ""The Southerner,"" I find okay, but not as entertaining to me personally as the other three.",1376179200,,294,4.267857142857143
