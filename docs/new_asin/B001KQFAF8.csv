8315810,2,B001KQFAF8,"CHENNAI KAADAL (or ""Chennai Kadhal""), released in 2006, isn't what you'd trot out when talking up Indian cinema. CHENNAI KAADAL is a Tamil film, and, no, I haven't seen a whole lot of Tamil, but it seems to be the weaker cousin to Bollywood. The production values are sort of rough, and, while the typical sensibilities that make up an Indian flick are present, they are poorly presented and executed. Genelia D'Souza is the female lead, and she's the only reason I picked up this DVD. But, man, she sure made a poor choice with her follow-up to the excellent BOMMARILLU.

The story is regurgitated from decades of rehashed plots and premises churned out by India's cinematic culture, whether it be Bollywood or Tamil or Telugu or from whatever other region. Bharath is a Tamil actor who plays Gowtham, our impetuous, ill-tempered hero. Gowtham is a college drop-out and a thug. He tends to get into fights and he's quick to disrespect his elders. And while there is some redemption headed his way, it's ultimately not enough to all the way redeem this clown, so he's got that going for him.

Genelia D'Souza doesn't make her entrance until almost half an hour into it, but when she does, Gowtham falls in love with her college girl character, Narmada. And, I guess, in certain places, a fella can still woo a girl using boorish techniques. Their courtship is established during a stalled train ride, a sequence that the film writers evidently regarded as comedy gold. But Narmada isn't really impressed with Gowtham until he passes himself off as a police inspector. Gowtham is soon lording it over all the other suckers taken in, including a gang of thugs scalping tickets. There's supposed to be an element of farce here, but the whole thing is just done so poorly.

A staple of Indian cinema is that, because of the film's length, there's always an intermission halfway thru and that a plot swerve is always introduced just before the intermission (or, as this DVD's sub-titles would have it, ""Separation""). The dramatic twist for CHENNAI KAADAL is that Narmada, college girl living in a girl's hostel, happens to be the daughter of a criminal kingpin. And that her father had just arranged for Narmada to marry his partner-in-crime's younger brother. Oh, snap. One would almost feel sorry for Gowtham if only he weren't such an assclown.

Unless you're a diehard Genelia D'Souza fan, I don't recommend CHENNAI KAADAL. Everything here is predictable. The male lead is unlikable. The picture has got this washed-out visual quality, as if it had been made in the '80s instead of 2006. The ""comedy"" is lame. My expectations of a watchable movie were dashed as soon as I saw the rough comedy bits involving a buffalo and the milking of it and the scooping up of its poo. I did laugh at one scene. You have to give some points for ballsiness to a film that features a crooked cop who is direct enough that he approaches the hero, plants narcotics in his front pocket as he looks on, and then immediately arrests him for drug trafficking. That was pretty funny.

In Indian cinema, verisimilitude is often treated like a curse word. In good Indian cinema, what happens is that we're priveleged to view these wonderful flights of fancy. But, in shoddy efforts, the lack of believability and grounding underscore just how bad the film is. Coincidence often plays a huge role; it crops up more frequently than a musical number (and Indian cinema, as you know, is replete with musical numbers), so steady yourself for a barrage of coincidences if you're watching this movie. There are fight scenes here, because a male lead may not be charismatic or witty or even a nice guy, but damn can he beat you up. Except that, again, believability flies out the window more forcefully than one of Gowtham's felled opponents. We're treated to unsubtle wire work, unconvincing ""bullet time"" effects, obviously missed kicks which still topple the goons, and hero leaps so improbable that even Hong Kong fight directors are giggling.

There are six musical numbers, all worth a pass.
