5134898,5,B0086746FY,"I noticed a few reviews on this prduct on Amazon and I do not think over all they do this film justice or give it the credit it deserves. Being an ex backpacker I really enjoyed the nature images which brought back many pleasent  memories of my former nature experiences. Waterfalls, streams, rivers, mountains, truly beautiful, espcially in 3D. For a relaxation video the  music is a fit as well. Certainly has the effect of making one feel content and happy to be alive in a world of substantial beauty that this film helps illustrate. Highly recommended for what this films purpose's really is, a nice, rich, luxurious, peaceful and serene experience of the beauty and loving imagry this world posseses if one will only look for it.",1358985600,8,735,4.734375
5134899,4,B0086746FY,This disc is for those who appreciate nature in its true form. It will bring peace of mind and relaxtion for those who have an affinity for for god's crations. The 3D effect allows us to get closer to gods paradise I I have seen this three times and shall do so many more times. Please note I am surrounfded by this type of vegetation and still feel the joy of seeing this in 3D. The movie allows us to focus on some areas which does not usually happen  when there in person. To get the best see it without distraction. Observe details.,1357948800,6,536,4.203883495145631
5134900,4,B0086746FY,This was a wonderful tour. Most of the scenes and 3D were spectacular. I could see faces in the rocks.,1352592000,2,102,4.15
5134901,3,B0086746FY,"I like most everything 3D, this set is well worth it and very relaxing. If you don't like it you can always return it.",1350172800,,118,3.9583333333333335
5134902,5,B0086746FY,This 3D DVD was really nice. I just got a 3D tv and wanted to have something to watch on it. The 3D effects were not overpowering but pretty and the music was relaxing. I would recommend it,1343174400,5,189,4.0
5134903,2,B0086746FY,"First of all, I'd like to say Ultimate 3D Heaven invested a lot of time on this project, and it shows. There are awesome shots, but there are also weak shots of mountains. The movie is divided into 4 chapters. The third and fourth chapters are the strongest with a lot of focus on waterfalls. Waterfalls really look great in 3D, mainly because it's water flowing towards you. There is also awesome footage of some houses and businesses alongside a mountain which I found to be spectacular.
  I'd also like to discuss the weak parts of the 40 minute or so DVD. I personally didn't care for the music. Some songs were better than others, but most or all included a flute playing. Some people may like the flute, but for me it was just overkill.
  I also thought the first 12 minutes was garbage footage(sorry guys). Basically, it was just closeups of icicles in a cave(remember, we are paying twenty dollars). I'm not even sure why that was included because there wasn't much of a 3D effect.
After the first 12 minutes, the scenery picked up showing better views with more of a 3D effect. There were water level views, views from a plane, and possibly views from a skylift. The camera work was excellent. I could tell that the cameraman was very experienced, and had good 3D camera equipment(it wasn't pop out in your face 3D, more like a 3D picture frame). I really enjoyed the open fields with the cows eating grass and the waterfalls showing strong and weak waterfalls alternating between the two.
I'd say Ultimate 3D Heaven is on to something. I think that this company would be more successful doing more travel type of videos in 3D. For instance, a European country highlighting the different cities with a map showing where each city is in between each scene.
Overall, excellent photography after the first 12 minutes, music was okay but could have been better. The cost of 20 dollars does not warrant a purchase though, since only 28 minutes of the 40 is really worth watching. I'm also aware most of the larger studios have 40 minutes of footage on their 3D movies, but this in no way compares to the 3D shown by professional studios with a large financial backing. I'd say it's worth a purchase if the price is lower than 20 dollars, and you really love mountains and waterfalls. Otherwise, I'd say skip and wait until Ultimate 3D gets a little more experienced, or they lower their price on this title.

To answer a question that was asked to me: Yes, the video is approximately 40 minutes. There are 2 other options that can extend the time, but it's the same footage, and you must own the paper 3-D glasses to view one of the options.",1341619200,38,2645,4.56
5134904,5,B0086746FY,"After seeing 3D Magic Forrest, I was very excited to see this one. I Loved it, and the really cool thing about this Blu-Ray is that there is THREE count them THREE DIFFERENT 3D Viewing Options. The Music in it was great, the scenery was awesome! If you love Tranquil music and tranquil scenery then this is a Blu Ray for you and also 3D Magic Forrest too!! Highly suggested!",1339372800,18,374,4.357142857142857
5134905,5,B0086746FY,"3D Magic forest was an amazing film. I love how they filmed this, it was very relaxing. I definitely recommend owning this movie. I will definitely put this movie in whenever i have a hard day, and i need to take my mind off the stress of my problems. The HD and 3D made me feel like i was there in the Hungarian National park.

5134907,3,B0086746FY,"Great subject matter and score - i really enjoyed watching except for many out-of-focus shots, and poor image quality due to using slow lenses (or nonsensitive film/sensor). There was a lot of motion blur, and grainy appearance especially in the water fall shots.  The 3-d effect is good, as is the camera work.  Value is not very good, but i will not send it back, as it is something i will watch again.",1439164800,,404,4.52054794520548

5134909,1,B0086746FY,Very disappointed they didn't work with my television. ..seller should of been more explicit with the compatibility of these 3d glasses as they don't work with Sharp Aquos Tv,1427587200,,174,5.0344827586206895
5134910,1,B0086746FY,"It is amazing how much misinformation you can find on the internet.  This movie does NOT use the 3D that ANY of today's home systems use, i.e., either the active shutter glasses or the passive polaroid glasses.  It uses an old, long-ago discarded anaglyphic system.  The anaglyphic system was discarded because it is incapable of displaying balanced color images since it relies on color filters to separate the images for each eye.  In this case RED and CYAN.  One reviewer suggest that this is the technology ""used in theatres;""  FAIL -- it was NEVER used in theatres for 3D presentation. Only the polaroid system was used for theatrical 3D movies.

All of today's theatre 3D systems (except the current Dolby 3D system) use polaroid 3D, NOT red and cyan (green) filters.  All the current 3DTVs use either passive or active filters; NONE use the anaglyphic system.

Chris Conklin says, ""Make sure your 3D system supports the glasses provided.""  That is totally incorrect.  NO 3DTV or home projection system equipment ""supports"" anaglyphic 3D because it is a terrible technology for all but black and white movies, and even then, it is a severe strain on the eyes so it was never even considered for today's 3D home technology as it totally destroys any semblance of natural color -- it filters out ALL colors except red in one eye and cyan in the other. You cannot see a real color image with this system.  Then Tyson Letter says,  ""The HD and 3D made me feel like I was there in the Hungarian National park."" ....well YEAH, if the only colors present in the Hungarian National Park were totally distorted by red and cyan filters on your eyes!

Mr. Conklin adds, ""Many of the newer 3D TV's use the similar movie theater technology...""  Again, totally fabricated misinformation simply pull out of thin air.  As I stated, anaglyphic color filtering is not at all similar to  any of today's cinema 3D technology; fact is, it is nothing like either the polaroid system (RealD 3D and IMAX) or the band filter system (Dolby 3D).  Then he goes on simply making it up as he goes:  ""...B-Movie Horror that have been put through the 3D upstepping process""  What?  More fiction.  He is confusing a digital process whereby lower resolution sources like DVDs are converted to a pseudo higher resolution to match the higher resolution capability of the display device.  He is confusing that with the process used to convert a movie shot in 2D and rendering it in 3D.  This is decidedly NOT done by ""upstepping,"" but accomplished with hugely sophisticated digital image-manipulating software and with many 3D artists who spend months converting a movie shot-by-shot/scene-by-scene to 3D; ""upstepping"" is a bogus term with regards to 2D -> 3D conversion.  In fact, it's not even the correct term for converting lower resolution source material to higher....that's called ""upREZZING"" not ""upstepping.""

How this company, in this day and age when 3DTV displays have a standard method capable of showing true, full-color 3D which has been in place for years now, did NOT author this title in real 3D like all the other BluRay 3D releases is beyond the pale and it is a TOTAL RIP-OFF.  I wouldn't care if they gave out 40 of these cheap red and green ""3D"" glasses with the disc -- anaglyphic is no way to see 3D, especially when every distributor and his brother is capable of authoring ACTUAL 3D BluRays as a matter of course.  This is just a scam and I can't stress enough how this fly-by-night outfit should be punished by NOBODY buying any of their crap.  EVER!

5134934,2,B0086746FY,"The Disk arrived quickly and in great shape.  The rest is of no fault to the seller but a review of the product:
The disk provides good scenic pictures and music.  Although, it would have been better to have music native to regional; unless my wife and I are mistaken (she graduated with a degree in music from a major university) we were looking at the Austrian country side with African music.
The disk has the same film in three formats so that different 3D system can be used to view the film (The only one usable on my Samsung was not close to what I have come to enjoy in my 3D films).  The water movement when watching the streams or vapor from a water fall was some what hard to watch as it seamed out of focus and a bit nauseating.  When looking at distant scenes the 3D looked great.  When there was some object near like a tree limb or bush and the camera was looking to the distance instead of the branch or flower being in the room it was simply an out of focus blur.  I have seen some excellent 3D where the water seams to flow right into your lap as the elephants move in the stream (it is just fantastic).  I was hoping for more WOW but only found nice to ok.
I would have liked to have had a fourth option which would have been Non-3D so that playing the film as background ambiance would have a nice clear picture.

Bottom Line I would never uses this film to show off my 3D system like I do with several nature shows I have DVRed off of 3Net or other procured 3D Blu-ray discs.",1362441600,2,1496,4.116838487972508

As a scenery BRD, it's a fine product. It's as a 3D ""movie"" that this is found wanting; I found myself lifting the glasses several times while it was playing to make sure they (the glasses) were turned on. Much what's filmed is far enough away that's there is very little perceived depth.

Much what's filmed is far enough away that's there is very little perceived depth. Closer up shots are devoid of things either farther away or noticeably closer, there isn't much there to be in 3D.
