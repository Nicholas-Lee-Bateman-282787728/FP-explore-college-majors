4597686,5,B0057Q8QNA,"I did read reviews that some customers were unhappy with their purchase of this dvd.  I am not one of those customers.  I remember the times and even on the tv, the shows were not that great in quality or color...maybe it was my portable tv. :/  I thought the quality was just fine. I loved revisiting the many different shows that Lucy brought to all of us those many years ago.  It's fun to see the guest appearances from different performers of yester-year!!  I love this dvd!!!",1330041600,3,481,4.420454545454546
4597687,4,B0057Q8QNA,"I bought this as a gift for my friend who LOVES Lucille Ball. I assumed it would be the lucy show, and its not. Instead these are episodes of the shows she did AFTER the ""I LOVE LUCY"" show. Lucille is older but just as funny. It's a diferent side of the actress but not bad. I don't know what the other review ment when they said they were bootleg. Good quality DVDs and even a bonus DVD of Betty White's show ""Life With Elizabeth."" If you're looking for the ""I LOVE LUCY"" then this is NOT what you want. If your a Lucille Ball fan and want to see some of her later work... This is PERFECT.  Same slap-stick comedy different age.  It dosent incorporate all 30 years of her on the screen, just the last few.  And whatever people say not bootleg.",1327017600,2,744,4.152777777777778
4597688,1,B0057Q8QNA,"Do not buy!!  They are terrible quality and are illegal bootlegs.  I wish someone would shut these companies down.  At least the music unions could, because we know they didn't pay to clear the music either!!

The official fifth season of The Lucy Show will be released on December 6th.  On that upcoming release, the episodes have been beautifully remastered in HD from the film negatives.  They look like night and day when compared to this cheap release.",1313971200,10,457,4.794871794871795

8461091,5,B0057Q8QNA,"While I didn't enjoy these 'as much' as the seasons of ""I love Lucy"". That's no reflection on it, (just personal opinion) Still had laughs and it is a fine product. I wasn't totally thrilled with how the dvds were in the dvd case. All in seperate sleeves so you have to pop out the top ones out if you are looking to get to the bottom dvd. Not a huge deal. Just not as nice as some. But overall I was satisfied. And I enjoyed the 5 episodes on the 4th disc of ""Life with Elizabeth"" with Betty White :) The shipping was fast, the condition perfect!",1377216000,,547,4.074074074074074

8461093,5,B0057Q8QNA,"I really love that my grandsons get to watch and love Lucy the way I always did as a child and now,as a adult,i STILL do! An American treasure! These episodes are from ""The lucy Show"",that I loved watching as a child. A great assortment of full episodes,and a few with Vivian Vance,as Aunt Viv. These episodes have Gale Gordon as ""Mr. Mooney,her boss. There a very few in b&W,episodes of when The Lucy show started and have Aunt viv...the majority are color. I love watching these again,and sharing them with my grandsons,the 8 year old is a BIG fan! he loves to come into my room,before time to go to sleep,and put a Lucy dvd in,and we share the laughter together! its a great thing that he would rather watch Lucy than the cable tv!",1360713600,,734,4.404411764705882
