7907086,5,B00000F4KJ,"It was the best movie that had The FANIA ALL STARS, From Celia Cruz, Tito Puente, Hector Lavoe etc. But Ruben Blades & Willie Colon were great in this movie production. Ruben a Singer/Boxer...Willie the Bad friend, Salvador Sanchez the living boxing star of its time, Fred Williamson a heavy hitter in the movie. This movie should be reproduced into DVD. The Salsa Music (Sound Track) was awesome, with 4 of my still long time favorites songs/tracks ...""What Happened""; the spin off song story of where Pedro Navaja left off...the sound track is still on my favorites. I have the LP, Cassette. CD. I also have the VHS of the movie. Vintage & great to have...",1514419200,,658,4.681034482758621
