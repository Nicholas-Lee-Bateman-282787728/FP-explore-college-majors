6516743,1,B00LYHXIAM,"I'll spare everyone the ""This MOVIE was an atrocity"" play on words, especially since about five others already tried that one. (Hey, maybe they should be micro-budget movie writers. That obvious line is about as creative as this movie was.) My big issue with this one is also my biggest issue with most bad micro-budget movies: there was no script. Honestly, it was as if a bunch of friends were sitting around one night and just decided to make a movie on the spot. Then they said, ""Hey, let's be super loud and obnoxious, then everyone will think we're awesome. And let's say f--k every 10th or 15th word. That won't get old.""

So everyone ends up playing (I guess in their eyes) a ""super cool"" version of themselves. They ham it up for the camera, or they act super intense for the camera or they amplify whatever their real personality traits are for the camera.

In general, this movie comes across as amateur, jumbled and difficult to follow. And none of the characters were likeable. Based on the ""writing,"" the acting and the production quality, I'd have expected to see this on YouTube, not on Prime. I guess they're just taking anything that was filmed in HD.",1423180800,,1169,4.615384615384615
6516744,3,B00LYHXIAM,"The plot of the movie is definitely new and refreshing, but I have had my fill of lost and found recordings and watching actors record themselves doing unbelievable things, never once stopping to say, ""that's wrong.""  The acting is better than usual for this level of movie but it is the same typical stuff, I do understand the group mentality but this group was just out of control and with no sympathy or caring for anyone.

As something to watch because I was bored, it fit the bill and I was curious to know the ending, they did good on holding that out till the last but how they did it; that did not make sense to me, because as officers of the law, they dragged out the information to themselves.

As I always say, we are all unique, you may or may not like, the choice is yours.",1423180800,,786,4.261744966442953

6516747,5,B00LYHXIAM,"This film was really amazing! For reality thrillers, this is the new king. Much more exciting and thrilling than Blair Witch, Paranormal, or anything else that's out there. The twists are wild and it keeps you guessing until the final 10 seconds--that's right, the final 10 seconds! Good luck figuring this one out before it's finished. You'll want to watch it several times to fully understand the wicked twists. This should be a cult classic.",1420070400,,444,4.933333333333334

6516749,1,B00LYHXIAM,"**NO SPOILERS** Just rented and watched this one today and, having just seen it, wanted to get up a review while it was still fresh (I actually on a second viewing as I write this, just to provide the clearest review for you that I can). First, this is a c-movie thriller (not horror), microbudget, ""weekend shoot"" found footage video. Now, having seen and reviewed dozens of these (at least) recently, and being one of my fav genres when they are carried off well, I've developed a fairly good base of reference for these films. So, here we go...

Atrocity, on a positive note, provides a fairly novel plot, which was somewhat refreshing. The screenplay was actually fairly good at least in concept, and does contain some interesting twists. Also, most actors were somewhat believable (if mostly comparable to what I can only compare to a sophomore year community college acting course) - which is critical to holding together films like this. Also, the film provides a slow build that keeps you engaged (at least for the first 30 minutes), unlike many c-horror films. In addition, also on a positive note, the director clearly allowed for a good deal of improv acting, which added to - instead of detracted from - the experience. Yet, and strangely, the film's acting slowly gets worse across the board as the movie goes on. The last half of the film, in particular, goes from tolerable to ridiculous. And when you get to the big fight scene (I won't spoil it by saying who is involved) you may, like me, find yourself actually laughing out loud at how bad it all is.

On the other side of the coin, there really wasn't much to the film overall, and this just lent to, overall, a reasonably tolerable experience. I hate to single out an individual actor, but the girl who plays Presley (I'll leave her name out here, just to avoid unnecessary rudeness) was actually so bad that she repeatedly took me out of the entire ""suspend disbelief"" aspect and reminded me I was watching a c-movie. Unfortunately, the Presley character is critical to the first half of the movie and appears repeatedly, at critical moments in the story (and later, the other female lead also goes on a ridiculos rant at just the wrong time with all the silliest dialogue as far as the plot goes, equally poorly overacted). But again, as I mentioned, the acting does start out pretty solidly, but it just collapses as the film goes on. I've never seen a film fall apart quite like this one, like a snowball of crappy acting and filmmaking rolling downhill. Also, and this was just a pet peeve, but the inclusion of Wolverine-like claws (the same kind, as discussed in in the film, found in some martial arts) by the film's protagonists was just just a lame addition that made the film just a bit more silly.

So why I am I spending so much time on a one-star review? Well, mostly to try and help provide you with the best ""to buy or not to buy"" decision when it comes to saving you some time and money. I definitely can't recommend paying for this one, but I would possibly recommend it if I comes up for free on Amazon Prime or Netflix. It may be worth one viewing if you enjoy this genre and really enjoy c-movie found footage thrillers (and find decent ones increasingly hard to come by).",1419552000,14,3264,4.566552901023891
6516750,1,B00LYHXIAM,"Horribly acted and poorly written, this ""Blair Witch"" teenager hackup flick tries to make you believe you are immersed in the world of some unfortunate and thoroughly unlikable teens as they ad-lib F-bombs and mug for the ever-present camera.  Personally, I cheered at each and every death. Too bad there were survivors.  This video is like watching some meth tweakers' home videos.",1419465600,7,382,5.145161290322581
6516751,4,B00LYHXIAM,"REality films has another winner on their hands,ATROCITY is another  Found Footage quasi-documentary on some very gruesome goings on one night.

So the viewer is watching mini-cam and phone footage of a revenge plot,that is actually very plausible and makes sense in an actual show of emotions onscreen.

The layers that become apparent to the chain of events ,Really well told and actors seem so real.

The special effects,editing and locations add a sense of realness.

The story needs to be seen,for all its doppelgangers,red herrings,stooges & foilsIts worth the seeing to the end reveal.",1412812800,,592,5.189473684210526
6516752,3,B00LYHXIAM,"Despite the poor reviews, the title and description snagged me right away and thus I watched it all the way through. Suffice it to say, this one is false advertising. There is no atrocity in it. They use this title to snag you and keep using the snag throughout the entire movie. The acting stunk. The ending concept was a very good idea for a movie. Maybe if someone else with more money and better acting took up this theme it would make a great movie.",1436832000,,454,4.290697674418604

6516768,2,B00LYHXIAM,"This movie is one of the better found footage films, i cannot rate it ""3"" stars because it was just okay, i didn't like it, i didn't absolutely hate it.
In found footage movies, i think editing plays a huge role, this movie was poorly edited, at the end it basically mocks you ""did you get it?"" Duuuuh.
It was a fairly simple plot, with some new turns. The choice to let some actors ad-lib wasn't horrible, but it wasn't the best, in some scenes it added, and in other scenes it made you laugh, at things that weren't supposed to be funny.
What truly bothered me was the dialogue between the sheriff/cop/captain obvious and the interviewer, it was painfully bad , and Presley.
The first 10-15 minutes almost made me turn it off, due to insane homophobic slang being thrown around left and right, i guess to prove a point later? i don't know, it was just awful, because it seemed like a roomful of dudes calling everyone , every insulting name in the book, ugh, beware it's like walking near the crowd before a big game.",1425513600,,1019,4.425531914893617

I didn't care to find out if this movie was actually filmed in Texas (Houston) or just set there but it 'seemed' the right place for these characters: not a nice one in the bunch.

6516777,1,B00LYHXIAM,"watching this movie was like watching a trainwreck. You wanted to stop but couldn't because you wanted to know what happens. The movie contains just about everything a slasher film contains -- gore, horror, slut shaming and, unfortunately, homophobia. Usually, that's fine, as long as the narrative isn't justifying the homophobia or slutshaming but I guess I should've paid closer attention to the catch line -- cheater catching a cheater.

Honestly, I think it's fine and interesting to explore the ugly truths of humanity, even if they take you to dark places like this. This wasn't taking me to a dark place, though, this narrative was actively aligning with the killer and I think that's what bugs me the most. :-(",1424217600,,719,4.9421487603305785

It was an extremely good film, though, and it appeared as though nobody was just ""acting"" but were real. Though how people don't realize that Brennan is Brennan is beyond me. I must have not seen it, though, because I didn't quite catch what happened to ...now I can't remember her name. Brittany's best friend. This is a good film to watch, and if I had bought this on DVD, I would not be disappointed. I would gladly like to add this to my personal collection.",1423699200,2,565,4.390476190476191
