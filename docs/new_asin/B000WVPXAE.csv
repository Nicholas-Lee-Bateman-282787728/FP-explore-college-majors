2992580,5,B000WVPXAE,"Don't do as the Romans do!  Each of these documentaries begins with our host, Terry Jones, in Rome, parroting what he (and we) had learned in school - how the barbaric peoples of the ancient world completely sacked and destroyed the worlds most enlightened culture of the time - Rome.  But wait...as Terry explains, there is much more to history than we have been taught.  The documentaries - four separate hours - give us a different view of these *barbarians*, which include the Celts, Goths, Parthians, Huns, and Vandals.  There are far too many interesting points to mention in this review, but I was particularly struck by the humanity of the Celts, who would stop the bloody gladiator games in any Roman city they overtook and allowed Celtic women to become warriors and leaders; as well as the Parthians of ancient Persia, who welcomed and celebrated diversity amongst the populace.

As with most of these types of historical documentaries, each is filmed on location, and includes plenty of interviews by experts (and some interesting demonstrations of inventions by Archimedes), as well as life action shots with actors dressed in period costume.  Much of the segment of the Parthians was filmed in modern day Iran, which makes the segment all the more out of the ordinary. Terry Jones, of Monty Python fame, with his strong British accent and animated face, makes for a unique presenter, which adds interest to the subject matter.

In fact, it's a riveting PBS-style overview of ancient global cultures who the Roman rulers dismissed as mere ""barbarians.""

Quite the contrary, Terry Jones criss-crosses Europe and Asia to show us the latest research into the ancient cultures of Celts, Goths, Persians, Greeks and other groups. The Celts he explores in this documentary are the patriarchs and matriarchs of the later Celts who are now all the rage in modern Christian movements.

In one hour-long episode after another, Jones demonstrates that rather than barbaric -- these ancient peoples were literate, technologically advanced and in many cases had sophisticated social networks. They simply weren't based on the Roman imperial model and were ruthlessly crushed, in several tragic cases.

Other ancient competitors to Rome fared better, of course.

This is a superb series to use in classes from schools to congregations! The episodes on the Celts and Persians are stunning.

2992585,3,B000WVPXAE,"Of course, a television program, which is what this was before it was made into a DVD, is never going to have the kind of detail and cogency of a book. The book which was made for the series (or is it the other way round?) contains a lot more information, and documentation of the propositions made by the author regarding the short-comings of Roman civilization. My review of the DVD is colored by the fact that I read the book before seeing the DVD, but this does not really invalidate my criticisms since reading the book has given me (at least I hope) a more complete picture of what Mr. Jones was trying to say in the video.

Much of what the author says regarding the European barbarians (Goths, Vandals, and Celts) is not new, and has been known for much of the last two centuries. The kind of pro-Roman chauvinism to which Mr. Jones is so opposed largely went out with Edward Gibbon in the 18th century. It may be that they were still teaching Gibbon when he was going to school. After all, he is kind of old. I remember when I was in college having a professor who actually believed that the Roman fleet used galley slaves, as was portrayed in Ben Hur.  I tried to explain to him that even Mommsen, back in the 19th century, knew that was not the case, but he just accused me of being credulous. I digress.

Still, there is a lot of very interesting new archaeological information presented in the series, and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it. I would recommend it to anyone interested in history of the period, with the caveat that Mr. Jones really has it in for the Romans, and he tends to stack the deck against them. I suspect he is descended from Boudicca, or at the very least was bullied by a classicist in school. The idea that the Roman contribution to western (and world) civilization is grossly overrated seems to be an obsession. In particular, I think the idea that the Romans (and that all Romans in all periods had the same attitudes) thought of the Greeks as barbarians is particularly extreme. The emperor Hadrian is a specific contrary example, and he is by no means alone. Furthermore, while some Romans doubtless thought of Parthians as at least depraved eastern foreigners, I doubt they were considered barbarians in the same sense as the Germanic tribes or even the Celts. The concept that a feudal political organization (Parthians/Persians) is somehow superior to a centralized state with a national bureaucracy (Rome) betrays Mr. Jones' medievalist roots.

To summarize: Buy it. Enjoy, but try to overlook some of the more strident anti-Roman diatribe.",1208217600,35,2586,4.652078774617068

THE BRAINY BARBARIANS (First broadcast 9th June 2006)
Jones argues that the ancient Greeks and Persians were in reality far from the Roman view of them as effeminate and addicted to luxury. The Greeks valued science and mathematics, while the Persians had initially allowed multiculturalism among the different ethnic groups of its empire (until years of war with Rome).
1.  Antikythera Mechanism

THE END OF THE WORLD (First broadcast 16th June 2006)
Around 400 AD, two Barbarian babies were born. One would grow up to become the most feared of all - Attila the Hun. The other, Geiseric, led the Vandals whom history has cast as destroyers. Jones finds out that Roman civilization wasn't destroyed by the invasion of these tribes, but by the loss of the North African tax base. He sees the common view of Rome and ""Barbarians"" as a result of the Roman Catholic Church popularizing the Roman version of the truth.

For past 20 years with Masters in Celtic culture have been disturbed by the strange stories that did not fit research.

Greek slaves known as Bagman the fire bogs long ruled Ireland until the Tuath da Dannan then today's Milesiuans the ancesters of Scots. Advanced civilizations that Rome needed to assert themselves, but heck watch and learn then make good use of the websites. Some pro-Roman histories still are pushed.

2992591,5,B000WVPXAE,"The daring premise of Mr. Jones' documentary is to question the past teachings about the Romans and their conquest throughout Europe.  While many of us were taught the greatness of Greece and grandeur of Rome, intrinsically one questions such proposition, and Mr. Jones assaults the notion of what are ""civilized"" people and what constitutes a ""barbarian.""  An amusing presentation is how the barbarians turned out to be the civilized and the civilized turned out to be the barbarians.  Similarly, the Greeks, who termed anything not Greek ""barbarian"" found themselves being called barbarians by the barbarians (the conquering) Romans!  Equally, the barbarian Romans began calling all non-Romans barbarians, and so the Gauls, Germans, Huns and Persians were also nominated the title of barbarians.

As the documentary evolves, Mr. Jones takes us through the conquest of Europe and beyond and we begin to see the ancient tribes of Europe and Asia with a different perspective.  The documentary presents an alternative view of the social structures, inventors with inventions, mathematicians, engineers and multiple complex structures not designed or even imagined by the Romans.  Concurrently, we are taken via the archeological finding that enumerates evidence of social structures that throw a wrench in the assumption of Roman civilization and whether it was a civilization or simply murderers disguised as civilized slaughterers.

If you are a fanatic about Roman culture and of its achievements, then the documentary will challenge your learning with the evidence presented and the questioning of such massacres that were more in tune with the Romans than other tribes.  Conversely, if you are open to hear the proposition about other peoples, their way of life, values and life before the Romans, then you will discover the pride in the Gauls, Germans, Huns and Persian or Parthians.  The latter show how despite a propaganda onslaught that has persisted in the west about the Persians brings another view and suggestion to modern day academics.  Incidentally, the terms become ""relative"" what are ""civilized"" people and what are ""barbarians.""  The labels, Mr. Jones seems to be saying, do not support the evidence, indeed do not apply and one should question such labels even today.

A final note Mr. Jones communicates comes ironically from the Roman Publius (or Gaius) Cornelius Tacitus (AD 56 - AD 117), describing vices and greed of his own Roman civilization and narrates how the Celtic Chieftain Calgacos fighting the Romans view them, ""To ravage, to slaughter, to usurp under false titles, they call empire; and where they make a desert, they call it peace.""",1308873600,4,2671,5.300947867298579

BUT - most people find serious history books to be so dry and stodgy that they don't read them.  I love history, but get so bored trying to read books that are overloaded with citations and footnotes - in fact I kept one of my history books around for years as a surefire sleep aid.  Two or three pages and I would be snoring.

So, making history interesting and entertaining is a welcome thing. And many of the stories and people I learned of in this book were completely new to me - and gave me some different points of view than the currently accepted version.

The point is: if people find material like this fascinating, they may then go on to dig deeper and decide for themselves. Even to the point of wading through all that dust

2992596,1,B000WVPXAE,"Koch Vision & the BBC presents Terry Jones Barbarians. It is a 205 minutes long in color, a 2 disc 4 part series TV documentary that was first aired on BBC2 in 2006. The episodes are as follows.
The Primitive Celts: 1. Celtic Barbarians, 2. Caesar's Gallic Wars.
The Savage Goths: 1. Arminius, 2. Dacian wars, 3. Alaric's Sack Of Rome.
The Brainy Barbarians: 1. Antikythera, 2. Archimedes & Syracuse, 3. Parthians, 4. Sassanians
The End Of The World: Mainly about the leaders Geiseric & Attila.

Terry Jones is a has been comedian from Monty Python fame & has no credentials to lecture on history, let alone produce such a 1 sided documentary. Even the so-called experts he uses are highly suspect. The clear goal from the very first minutes of this series is to reverse the historical records we have to fit his thesis. Which clearly is that the Romans were 90% evil & their enemies were 90% humane, advanced, folks who were just on the losing side of history. There was no mention that much of the history of this period was lost, nor did he ever mention that much of the information we have on Rome came from their enemies. Example: he mentions the Roman author Polybius to berate him, the problem is that he was a Greek writing some positive things on Rome. That is a big error in itself.

This series also makes 2 lame implications, that the ancient Romans views of other cultures remained constant over a period of 1,200 years, & that history is always written by the winners. That in itself builds this series on sand.

1. Celtic Barbarians; The brehon laws he spoke of with Donnchadh O'Corrain did not even exist during the Roman period. These laws allowed men to beat their wives so long as they did not leave a mark. That should please the women don't you think? The Greeks, Etruscans, & Romans never sold their women into slavery which the Celts certainly did. As late as the Viking period the church in Ireland condemned this practice. So much for the matriarchal leaning Celts treating their women well. Also, Roman law was first codified in 451BC centuries before the Celts wrote their laws down. Even an ardent Celtophile like Frank Delaney in his series ""The Celts,"" stated that after the initial conquest the Romans did indeed bring protection, order, & stability.

Another false claim was his stating without any proof{DNA, etc} that most modern day Europeans are descended from Celts. The term celtic was a linguistic tradition, not an ethnic or racial one, it did not even become common until Edward Lhuyd popularized it in 1707AD. The fact is these Celts were warlike, practiced human sacrifice{June-July 2002 issue of Archaeology magazine}, head hunting, & started the wars against both Greece & Rome{Their is no definitive proof that the Romans started it at Clusium-Bryan Garrett-archaeologist & scholar}. Thus, his portrayal of these people as being flowery, humane, just, & innocent victims is simply a lie.

2. Caesar's Gallic Wars: he turns Caesar into a Genghiz Khan figure which is a gross exaggeration. Does he truly believe that his tiny army killed a million Gauls? Where is the archaeological proof? He just uses Caesar's quote as fact in this case while disbelieving just about everything else in his Gallic Wars book. Mr. Jones barely mentioned the long period of the Celts in N. Italy{not Gaul as he wrongly stated} had attacked the Romans constantly from 390BC to 225BC until they were crushed at Telamon. Nor did he mention their genocidal behavior at the Etruscan city of Melpum 396BC or at the Greek city of Delphi 279BC. Ancient scholars like Pausanias & Strabo, & modern ones like Tim Newark in his book ""Ancient Celts"" pages 6,10, & 14 state that the Celts committed genocide. Another blatant omission was his failure to mention that had Caesar not conquered the Gauls the even more ruthless Germans were doing exactly that, he stopped them.

The Savage Goths: The Cheruscan German leader Arminius{Hermann} was no hero, if he had been his own people would not have killed him, just like Caesar he went to far. He had been a Roman citizen & swore an oath to Rome. This was a very short sighted part. If Germania had been Romanized
there would not have been a French-German problem, 2 world wars, Hitler, or the Holocaust. Does anyone truly believe that once the Roman empire became Christian that it was or could be as bad as Hitler's third reich?

The Romans did not have insane racial theories, religious crusades, concentration camps, or religious wars of conversion. The latter was done by the church, not the Roman empire. It should be mentioned that both slavery by Trajan's time & the blood bath games had been declining long before the Emperor Constantine outlawed them.

4. Dacian wars: these people had been attcking the Romans for decades. what was the emperor trajan to do? he even set his dacian prisoners free nor did Mr. Jones prove that any genocide took place. If the Romans had been so bad, why do modern day Romanians{rightly or not?} consider themselves to be descended from Roman colonists?

5. Alaric's Sack Of Rome: this was the only actual truthful part in the 2 disc series, Alaric-Visigoth & Geiseric's-Vandal sacks of Rome were mild. But, Mr. Jones bashing the catholic church for spreading pro=Roman propaganda was totally false. The church is largely responsible for almost all of the information we have on ancient Rome whether positive or negative. Most of our history books on this era were translated & written by people in the church. Remember, the church was seeking Christian converts by demonizing the whole Pagan world. Michael Grant's book ""Fall Of the Roman Empire"" part 6, chapter 13 gives plenty of proof how the church helped undermine the Roman state while adopting some of the administrative qualities that made the empire work. There was also no mention of Jordanes the Goth who wrote the history of his people. So much for the victors always writing the history books.

The Brainy Barbarians: 1 & 2 the Antikythera mechanism & Archimedes' genius does not prove that the Greeks were on the verge of an industrial revolution. If that was the caes, it still could have occurred under Rome or the later Byzantine empire. He totally failed to prove that the Romans were suppressing knowledge. In fact Michael Woods book ""Ancient Machines:
Wedges To Waterwheels"" shows how the Romans advanced technology like the Mill at Barbegal in S.France which provided the 12,000 people of Arles with a huge surplus food supply. Mr. Jones also failed to prove{sources?] that the Romans ever called their eastern neighbors Greece, Persia, etc barbarians. It should be common knowledge that when people are at war they tend to demonize each other.

7&8 Parthians & Persians: these peoples were no more humane than the Romans. In fact the Greeks learned about crucifixion from these peoples after having it done to them. The Romans learned it from the human sacrificing Carthaginians. Contrary to the claim in this series it was the Romans who were the first people to give citizenship to the conquered, which is something even the Greeks never did until the Byzantine era. The mini-industrial revolution occurred under the Roman-Benedictine order in the middle ages, as was stated in James Burke's book ""Connections.""

9. The End Of The World: here is where he & his experts failed to mention many of the real causes of Rome's decline & fall. Things like constant civil wars between aspiring emperors, outbreaks of disease & famine, political insatbility, & invasions. All of which helped caused a massive decline in trade & population. His claim that the loss of the north african tax base was short sighted. it was the loss of the grain supply from there that led to starvation in parts of Europe. the true loss of the tax base was the occupation & often destruction of the european cities by the Huns. They were the worst of the barbarians since for this reason & their extorting from both halves of the empire which fatally weaked the western half.

If Attila was the gentler leader that Mr. Jones portrayed him to be, why did so many Germans fight with Rome to defeat him at Chalons in 451AD? While shortly after his death in 453, the Germans in his empire revolted & destroyed it. The Vandals did persecute the non-Arian Christians in north Africa. Once again Mr. Jones failed to give any sources to try & prove his thesis that the Vandals had been more humane than the Romans. The bishop Quodvultdeus was exiled, Saint Augustine & Procopius' books describe in detail how many fled from Vandal persecution.

I recommend reading the scholarly books by JPVD Balsdon ""Romans & Aliens,"" G.K.Chesterton's ""Everlasting Man,"" Saint Aquinas' ""Dumb Ox, Catholicism & Conversion,"" Henry Adams ""Montsaint Michele & Chartre,"" Hillaire Belloc's ""The Crusades,"" & any books by Michael Grant & John Keegan. I'm very glad I rented this from the library rather than having wasted twenty dollars.

Lastly, if people believe this hatefest against Rome they may very well believe that the ""Mongols were humane &
civilized while the millions of Chinese they butchered in the 12th-13th centuries were BARBARIANS?""",1224115200,41,9167,4.867307692307692

3227082,3,B000WVPXAE,"Of course, a television program, which is what this was before it was made into a DVD, is never going to have the kind of detail and cogency of a book. The book which was made for the series (or is it the other way round?) contains a lot more information, and documentation of the propositions made by the author regarding the short-comings of Roman civilization. My review of the DVD is colored by the fact that I read the book before seeing the DVD, but this does not really invalidate my criticisms since reading the book has given me (at least I hope) a more complete picture of what Mr. Jones was trying to say in the video.

Much of what the author says regarding the European barbarians (Goths, Vandals, and Celts) is not new, and has been known for much of the last two centuries. The kind of pro-Roman chauvinism to which Mr. Jones is so opposed largely went out with Edward Gibbon in the 18th century. It may be that they were still teaching Gibbon when he was going to school. After all, he is kind of old. I remember when I was in college having a professor who actually believed that the Roman fleet used galley slaves, as was portrayed in Ben Hur.  I tried to explain to him that even Mommsen, back in the 19th century, knew that was not the case, but he just accused me of being credulous. I digress.

Still, there is a lot of very interesting new archaeological information presented in the series, and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it. I would recommend it to anyone interested in history of the period, with the caveat that Mr. Jones really has it in for the Romans, and he tends to stack the deck against them. I suspect he is descended from Boudicca, or at the very least was bullied by a classicist in school. The idea that the Roman contribution to western (and world) civilization is grossly overrated seems to be an obsession. In particular, I think the idea that the Romans (and that all Romans in all periods had the same attitudes) thought of the Greeks as barbarians is particularly extreme. The emperor Hadrian is a specific contrary example, and he is by no means alone. Furthermore, while some Romans doubtless thought of Parthians as at least depraved eastern foreigners, I doubt they were considered barbarians in the same sense as the Germanic tribes or even the Celts. The concept that a feudal political organization (Parthians/Persians) is somehow superior to a centralized state with a national bureaucracy (Rome) betrays Mr. Jones' medievalist roots.

THE BRAINY BARBARIANS (First broadcast 9th June 2006)
Jones argues that the ancient Greeks and Persians were in reality far from the Roman view of them as effeminate and addicted to luxury. The Greeks valued science and mathematics, while the Persians had initially allowed multiculturalism among the different ethnic groups of its empire (until years of war with Rome).
1.  Antikythera Mechanism
2.  Archimedes and Syracuse
3.  Parthians
4.  Sassanids

THE END OF THE WORLD (First broadcast 16th June 2006)
Around 400 AD, two Barbarian babies were born. One would grow up to become the most feared of all - Attila the Hun. The other, Geiseric, led the Vandals whom history has cast as destroyers. Jones finds out that Roman civilization wasn't destroyed by the invasion of these tribes, but by the loss of the North African tax base. He sees the common view of Rome and ""Barbarians"" as a result of the Roman Catholic Church popularizing the Roman version of the truth.

For past 20 years with Masters in Celtic culture have been disturbed by the strange stories that did not fit research. Terry in 15 minutes told the true history with less than an hour to undo Roman History written by Ceasers. So much was influenced by this story from who discovered America, Persians and Greeks. Greek slaves known as Bagman the fire bogs long ruled Ireland until the Tuath da Dannan then today's Milesiuans the ancesters of Scots. Advanced civilizations that Rome needed to assert themselves, but heck watch and learn then make good use of the websites. Some pro-Roman histories still are pushed.

3227088,5,B000WVPXAE,"The daring premise of Mr. Jones' documentary is to question the past teachings about the Romans and their conquest throughout Europe.  While many of us were taught the greatness of Greece and grandeur of Rome, intrinsically one questions such proposition, and Mr. Jones assaults the notion of what are ""civilized"" people and what constitutes a ""barbarian.""  An amusing presentation is how the barbarians turned out to be the civilized and the civilized turned out to be the barbarians.  Similarly, the Greeks, who termed anything not Greek ""barbarian"" found themselves being called barbarians by the barbarians (the conquering) Romans!  Equally, the barbarian Romans began calling all non-Romans barbarians, and so the Gauls, Germans, Huns and Persians were also nominated the title of barbarians.

As the documentary evolves, Mr. Jones takes us through the conquest of Europe and beyond and we begin to see the ancient tribes of Europe and Asia with a different perspective.  The documentary presents an alternative view of the social structures, inventors with inventions, mathematicians, engineers and multiple complex structures not designed or even imagined by the Romans.  Concurrently, we are taken via the archeological finding that enumerates evidence of social structures that throw a wrench in the assumption of Roman civilization and whether it was a civilization or simply murderers disguised as civilized slaughterers.

If you are a fanatic about Roman culture and of its achievements, then the documentary will challenge your learning with the evidence presented and the questioning of such massacres that were more in tune with the Romans than other tribes.  Conversely, if you are open to hear the proposition about other peoples, their way of life, values and life before the Romans, then you will discover the pride in the Gauls, Germans, Huns and Persian or Parthians.  The latter show how despite a propaganda onslaught that has persisted in the west about the Persians brings another view and suggestion to modern day academics.  Incidentally, the terms become ""relative"" what are ""civilized"" people and what are ""barbarians.""  The labels, Mr. Jones seems to be saying, do not support the evidence, indeed do not apply and one should question such labels even today.

A final note Mr. Jones communicates comes ironically from the Roman Publius (or Gaius) Cornelius Tacitus (AD 56 - AD 117), describing vices and greed of his own Roman civilization and narrates how the Celtic Chieftain Calgacos fighting the Romans view them, ""To ravage, to slaughter, to usurp under false titles, they call empire; and where they make a desert, they call it peace.""",1308873600,4,2671,5.300947867298579

I love history, but get so bored trying to read books that are overloaded with citations and footnotes - in fact I kept one of my history books around for years as a surefire sleep aid.  Two or three pages and I would be snoring.

So, making history interesting and entertaining is a welcome thing. And many of the stories and people I learned of in this book were completely new to me - and gave me some different points of view than the currently accepted version.

The point is: if people find material like this fascinating, they may then go on to dig deeper and decide for themselves. Even to the point of wading through all that dust

3227093,1,B000WVPXAE,"Koch Vision & the BBC presents Terry Jones Barbarians. It is a 205 minutes long in color, a 2 disc 4 part series TV documentary that was first aired on BBC2 in 2006. The episodes are as follows.
The Primitive Celts: 1. Celtic Barbarians, 2. Caesar's Gallic Wars.
The Savage Goths: 1. Arminius, 2. Dacian wars, 3. Alaric's Sack Of Rome.
The Brainy Barbarians: 1. Antikythera, 2. Archimedes & Syracuse, 3. Parthians, 4. Sassanians
The End Of The World: Mainly about the leaders Geiseric & Attila.

Terry Jones is a has been comedian from Monty Python fame & has no credentials to lecture on history, let alone produce such a 1 sided documentary. Even the so-called experts he uses are highly suspect. The clear goal from the very first minutes of this series is to reverse the historical records we have to fit his thesis. Which clearly is that the Romans were 90% evil & their enemies were 90% humane, advanced, folks who were just on the losing side of history. There was no mention that much of the history of this period was lost, nor did he ever mention that much of the information we have on Rome came from their enemies. Example: he mentions the Roman author Polybius to berate him, the problem is that he was a Greek writing some positive things on Rome. That is a big error in itself.

This series also makes 2 lame implications, that the ancient Romans views of other cultures remained constant over a period of 1,200 years, & that history is always written by the winners. That in itself builds this series on sand.

1. Celtic Barbarians; The brehon laws he spoke of with Donnchadh O'Corrain did not even exist during the Roman period. These laws allowed men to beat their wives so long as they did not leave a mark. That should please the women don't you think? The Greeks, Etruscans, & Romans never sold their women into slavery which the Celts certainly did. As late as the Viking period the church in Ireland condemned this practice. So much for the matriarchal leaning Celts treating their women well. Also, Roman law was first codified in 451BC centuries before the Celts wrote their laws down. Even an ardent Celtophile like Frank Delaney in his series ""The Celts,"" stated that after the initial conquest the Romans did indeed bring protection, order, & stability.

Another false claim was his stating without any proof{DNA, etc} that most modern day Europeans are descended from Celts. The term celtic was a linguistic tradition, not an ethnic or racial one, it did not even become common until Edward Lhuyd popularized it in 1707AD. The fact is these Celts were warlike, practiced human sacrifice{June-July 2002 issue of Archaeology magazine}, head hunting, & started the wars against both Greece & Rome{Their is no definitive proof that the Romans started it at Clusium-Bryan Garrett-archaeologist & scholar}. Thus, his portrayal of these people as being flowery, humane, just, & innocent victims is simply a lie.

2. Caesar's Gallic Wars: he turns Caesar into a Genghiz Khan figure which is a gross exaggeration. Does he truly believe that his tiny army killed a million Gauls? Where is the archaeological proof? He just uses Caesar's quote as fact in this case while disbelieving just about everything else in his Gallic Wars book. Mr. Jones barely mentioned the long period of the Celts in N. Italy{not Gaul as he wrongly stated} had attacked the Romans constantly from 390BC to 225BC until they were crushed at Telamon. Nor did he mention their genocidal behavior at the Etruscan city of Melpum 396BC or at the Greek city of Delphi 279BC. Ancient scholars like Pausanias & Strabo, & modern ones like Tim Newark in his book ""Ancient Celts"" pages 6,10, & 14 state that the Celts committed genocide. Another blatant omission was his failure to mention that had Caesar not conquered the Gauls the even more ruthless Germans were doing exactly that, he stopped them.

The Savage Goths: The Cheruscan German leader Arminius{Hermann} was no hero, if he had been his own people would not have killed him, just like Caesar he went to far. He had been a Roman citizen & swore an oath to Rome. This was a very short sighted part. If Germania had been Romanized
there would not have been a French-German problem, 2 world wars, Hitler, or the Holocaust. Does anyone truly believe that once the Roman empire became Christian that it was or could be as bad as Hitler's third reich?

The Romans did not have insane racial theories, religious crusades, concentration camps, or religious wars of conversion. The latter was done by the church, not the Roman empire. It should be mentioned that both slavery by Trajan's time & the blood bath games had been declining long before the Emperor Constantine outlawed them.

4. Dacian wars: these people had been attcking the Romans for decades. what was the emperor trajan to do? he even set his dacian prisoners free nor did Mr. Jones prove that any genocide took place. If the Romans had been so bad, why do modern day Romanians{rightly or not?} consider themselves to be descended from Roman colonists?

5. Alaric's Sack Of Rome: this was the only actual truthful part in the 2 disc series, Alaric-Visigoth & Geiseric's-Vandal sacks of Rome were mild. But, Mr. Jones bashing the catholic church for spreading pro=Roman propaganda was totally false. The church is largely responsible for almost all of the information we have on ancient Rome whether positive or negative. Most of our history books on this era were translated & written by people in the church. Remember, the church was seeking Christian converts by demonizing the whole Pagan world. Michael Grant's book ""Fall Of the Roman Empire"" part 6, chapter 13 gives plenty of proof how the church helped undermine the Roman state while adopting some of the administrative qualities that made the empire work. There was also no mention of Jordanes the Goth who wrote the history of his people. So much for the victors always writing the history books.

The Brainy Barbarians: 1 & 2 the Antikythera mechanism & Archimedes' genius does not prove that the Greeks were on the verge of an industrial revolution. If that was the caes, it still could have occurred under Rome or the later Byzantine empire. He totally failed to prove that the Romans were suppressing knowledge. In fact Michael Woods book ""Ancient Machines:
Wedges To Waterwheels"" shows how the Romans advanced technology like the Mill at Barbegal in S.France which provided the 12,000 people of Arles with a huge surplus food supply. Mr. Jones also failed to prove{sources?] that the Romans ever called their eastern neighbors Greece, Persia, etc barbarians. It should be common knowledge that when people are at war they tend to demonize each other.

7&8 Parthians & Persians: these peoples were no more humane than the Romans. In fact the Greeks learned about crucifixion from these peoples after having it done to them. The Romans learned it from the human sacrificing Carthaginians. Contrary to the claim in this series it was the Romans who were the first people to give citizenship to the conquered, which is something even the Greeks never did until the Byzantine era. The mini-industrial revolution occurred under the Roman-Benedictine order in the middle ages, as was stated in James Burke's book ""Connections.""

9. The End Of The World: here is where he & his experts failed to mention many of the real causes of Rome's decline & fall. Things like constant civil wars between aspiring emperors, outbreaks of disease & famine, political insatbility, & invasions. All of which helped caused a massive decline in trade & population. His claim that the loss of the north african tax base was short sighted. it was the loss of the grain supply from there that led to starvation in parts of Europe. the true loss of the tax base was the occupation & often destruction of the european cities by the Huns. They were the worst of the barbarians since for this reason & their extorting from both halves of the empire which fatally weaked the western half.

If Attila was the gentler leader that Mr. Jones portrayed him to be, why did so many Germans fight with Rome to defeat him at Chalons in 451AD? While shortly after his death in 453, the Germans in his empire revolted & destroyed it. The Vandals did persecute the non-Arian Christians in north Africa. Once again Mr. Jones failed to give any sources to try & prove his thesis that the Vandals had been more humane than the Romans. The bishop Quodvultdeus was exiled, Saint Augustine & Procopius' books describe in detail how many fled from Vandal persecution.

I recommend reading the scholarly books by JPVD Balsdon ""Romans & Aliens,"" G.K.Chesterton's ""Everlasting Man,"" Saint Aquinas' ""Dumb Ox, Catholicism & Conversion,"" Henry Adams ""Montsaint Michele & Chartre,"" Hillaire Belloc's ""The Crusades,"" & any books by Michael Grant & John Keegan. I'm very glad I rented this from the library rather than having wasted twenty dollars.

Lastly, if people believe this hatefest against Rome they may very well believe that the ""Mongols were humane &
civilized while the millions of Chinese they butchered in the 12th-13th centuries were BARBARIANS?""",1224115200,41,9167,4.867307692307692
