2992567,3,B000WW1YQ0,and yet another one bought for hubby.  Ralphie is funny but he's a little too 'raw' for me.,1207353600,,91,4.055555555555555
2992568,1,B000WW1YQ0,"This is probably one of the worst Ralphie May DVDs out. Being an avid fan of Ralphie, this DVD is really a BIG let down. Majority of the jokes are from the Iraq tour video, available at the end of the 'Just Correct' DVD. Perhaps because this was filmed in Tenn, he is really toned down in his language and uses more politically correct terms, which is not the norm for him. But also the fake Nashville accent he tries to push is very bad. IMO, don't waste your money buying this one, spend it on 'Just Correct'.",1196985600,6,511,4.224489795918367
2992569,5,B000WW1YQ0,This is for only those who like to laugh out loud.,1412899200,,50,3.6363636363636362
2992570,5,B000WW1YQ0,"Typical Ralphie May...hilarious! And in this day of political correctness, it's nice to see a man who won't conform. Highly recommended.",1380412800,,136,5.523809523809524
2992571,5,B000WW1YQ0,This dvd is so hilarius that keeps things going thru the whole set. He laughs at himself as well as other people. He just doesn't hold back. Even stuff that you have heard before it still makes you laugh.,1376352000,,204,4.256410256410256
2992572,1,B000WW1YQ0,"the reason why i gave it a 1 isnt, because the dvd was scratched or missed up.  I gave it a 1, because i didn't like it. The stuff they cut out of on comedy central i know how.",1355011200,,176,3.5128205128205128
2992573,5,B000WW1YQ0,Ralphie has it down pat as far as relations between men and women- it has halped us understand each other better and still laugh about it.,1258329600,,138,4.346153846153846
2992574,5,B000WW1YQ0,"I will also add my surprise to the not so great reviews for this one. I have all of Ralphie's dvd's and this one is definately a favorite!  I saw the reference to buy Just Correct, since some of the material is the same- Look - if your a fan of someone... buy all their stuff! Yea , some of the material sounds familiar, but what about all the other funny stuff thats not a repeat!  Everytime I watch this and everyone I show it to laughs out loud! Great buy- give it a try!",1230249600,,474,3.9789473684210526
2992575,5,B000WW1YQ0,"I saw this on Comedy Central.  It was so funny that I bought the cd for my husband for Christmas.  He loved it and I thought it was just as funny -- maybe funnier, the second time around.

I purchased two copies as gifts for a couple of hard-to buy-for married men on my list.

Don't watch it with the kids!  Adults only.",1227398400,,321,4.031746031746032
2992576,5,B000WW1YQ0,"Ralphie May is a great comedian.  He doesn't try to powder coat things.  He makes a lot of racist remarks, but when he does make comments he is telling it how he sees it.  I would recommend that you try to watch some clips of Ralphie May before considering to by any of his DVDs, but if you like a comedian that is not afraid of say what other whisper about you will love Ralphie May.

Having put out two other DVDs, Prime Cut does not have the same hilarity as the others.  Although that is for you to decide.",1227398400,,510,4.06
2992577,5,B000WW1YQ0,This DVD had me rolling.  Everyone who has watched it with me agreed it is the funniest stand up around.  You will not be disappointed with this purchase.  I have watched it about a dozen times and still laugh histarically everytime I watch it!,1213833600,,244,4.5
2992578,4,B000WW1YQ0,"I have become a huge fan of Ralphie's in this past year. I started with his first DVD, Just Correct (4 stars), and thought it was well above average. His second DVD, Girth of a Nation (5 stars), is one of the best stand up shows I have ever seen. Prime Cut is his third, and while it isn't as good as Girth of a Nation, it's still hilarious!

I was appalled at the other reviews here. I had seen this act on Comedy Central and had loved it. I needed to get a copy, but thought I must have the wrong DVD when I saw these few negative reviews. I bought it anyway, and it is the right DVD, and it is still a riot. So here I am to speak up for Ralphie, and hopefully others won't be put off by any unjust low ratings.

One reviewer thought he was too ""toned down"" or censored in this show and the other thought he was too ""raw"" or offensive for her tastes. I guess my girlfriend and I are in the middle- we both laughed our a*s*s off.

He doesn't curse much in this DVD, but he does not shy away from being offensive or sexually crude (to put it lightly), but that is either fine with you or it isn't. This is your only warning. Don't act surprised. Don't.

My other recent favorite stand-up comedians include:
Louis Black, Jeff Dunham, Katt Williams, and Wanda Sykes.

Try them too!",1209427200,5,1279,4.1
