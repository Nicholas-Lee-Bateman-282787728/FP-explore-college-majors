The plot chugs along, suspense remains constant throughout the movie, the characters are believable, nothing ""Hollywood"" about it.  Almost feels like a documentary.  Not a great film but quite satisfactory, one that can go on your dvd shelf and be seen from time to time.",1476230400,2,354,4.966101694915254
8689080,5,B00PSH21W0,"I read about this little post-World War II London drama on Amazon.  I had never heard of it before, and ordered it after three reviews of the plot.  It is a well-written and directed drama, amid the bomb damaged ruins of London. Picture quality is good, thought the audio track could use some restoration.",1434240000,3,305,4.62962962962963

8689082,5,B00PSH21W0,"Suspenseful post-WWII thriller set in a grimy and still war-torn London. An ""A"" production made with a ""B"" budget. A chance to see a lost era in London's history.  The acting is very good.",1424563200,6,188,4.529411764705882
8689083,5,B00PSH21W0,"Really delighted to find out this is being released and on Blu Ray. I've a rough VHS version which does the job but it deserves better.  It's been of out of print for donkey's years which is a shame as it is an wonderful thriller set in the immediate world of postwar London. I remember this being shown on TV during the Christmas season when I was a kid in England and I never forgot it, especially the opening. It also stars George Cole. Cannae wait!",1417478400,9,452,4.255813953488372
