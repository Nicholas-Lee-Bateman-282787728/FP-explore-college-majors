8386646,4,B00316QBJE,"Planet Terror/Death Proof are offbeat and atypical parodies. Essentially, both movies simultaneously pay homage to the best and worst aspects of cult classic retro-bonus features intended for Drive-In Theater audiences. Moreover, Planet Terror and Death Proof should be judged within the sub-genre of satirical tongue-in-cheek parody if they are to be given fair and balanced critical analysis. To do otherwise, is to miss the purpose and intent of the film makers. Specifically, the objectives of the two films were more than adequately achieved. Moreover, Planet Terror and Death Proof have already attained both cult classic and mass audience appeal by revisiting nostalgic elements of their cult classic predecessors.",1380412800,,721,5.685185185185185
