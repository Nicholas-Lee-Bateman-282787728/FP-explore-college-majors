6936721,3,B00RYZFNZG,"The Better Angels is, without a doubt, a very beautiful film, arrestingly so.  The black and white is fantastic and adds a great tone to every shot, and every shot is orchestrated with a sense of wonder and mastery.  And, to any Terrence Malick films out there, from almost every point of view, this is a copycat Malick film, which is both a problem and not.

The director, AJ Edwards, worked as an assistant to Malick for 11 years, this film being his debut.  While in interviews he tries to cover it up as desperately as possible, naming all kinds of sources, this film is undeniably a copycat of Malick, down to every style point.  When you look past this, The Better Angels, as I mentioned above, is beautiful.  However, upon my initial viewing, I thought it was void of true depth either of characterization or of emotion.  That being said, the subject matter is a heavy one: it focuses on a few years in the early childhood of Abraham Lincoln, and the experiences, hardships, and tragedy which shaped him.

This film focuses so heavily on style and beauty and elegance that it is nearly void, in my opinion, of anything that truly ties you to the characters.  It has its truly poetic sequences and some chances to attach you to the characters, but I never once felt like I knew any of the characters--it was more like I was watching them go through motions, emotions, and events, and was trying to feel something for them but struggled to, even when things happened that should have carried true emotional weight.  There was no substance, very little beneath the surface, in what could've been a really great story, one I hoped to love.

In addition to that, to me it felt way too much like an imitation of Terrence Malick, and because of this, came off as pretentious.  I truly give it 2 and a half stars, mostly for its beauty and that, as a Malick imitation, it certainly looks great.  But there's so little else that gives it any weight as a story.  This would be a great film to play in the background if you want something quietly poetic and pretty to have in the air.",1425254400,3,2080,4.482758620689655
6936722,4,B00RYZFNZG,This was a cerebral account of the childhood of Abraham Lincoln.  Very deep and unusual film technique.,1425254400,,103,5.0588235294117645

6936724,4,B00RYZFNZG,"MOODY AND QUIET, SHOT MORE AS AN ART PIECE THAT INFORMS VISUALLY AND EMOTIONALLY SO MUCH AS HISTORICALLY

Though this is a biographical drama and a feature length film, it will not be the kind of history telling most people are used to.  Strict historians should be prepared to see a film shot more as art house cinema.  That is not a criticism, just a simple mention of the origin and style of the film.  It informs us through mood and visual imagery to convey a feeling of living backwoods over two centuries ago.  The story is narrated from the perspective of an older cousin that went to live with the Lincolns when he was a young boy.  The narration is sparse, but well placed to help us understand events.  Outside of that, we see a frontier family in a remote log cabin scratching a living out of the woods.  They go about their daily life having the kind of undramatic, everyday conversations one might expect.  They play in the meadow, plow their field, sow their corn.  The thing that immerses the viewer into this very simple tale is the complete envelope of nature.  The birds in the trees, the sound of the brook, the rain on the leaves, the wind at night.  All are ever-present with just a little orchestra here and there to press the emotion.  The austerity of their life is a significant character of the film.

THE STORY ITSELF:  This is history so there isn't really anything for me to giveaway.  Nevertheless, I will tread lightly and just give you the direction the story is headed.  The tale gives us a glimpse of Abraham as a young boy still old enough to work the fields.  It bridges the period before his mother's death until some time after the arrival of his stepmother and her additional children.  We see how important and supportive both his mothers were and the austerity of his father.  As the movie portrays it, his father was a good but severe man and definitely a frontier type.  But perhaps somewhat intimidated by Abraham's intelligence and seemingly closed personality.  We see though very simple events the formative process in Abraham's life.  The work, the play, the relationships, and the responsibility placed on children of that time.  Viewers will be somewhat surprised at the tasks the children are left to accomplish on their own in a deadly environment.

OTHER THOUGHTS:  In the strictest sense, you won't know much more about Abraham Lincoln than what can be conveyed in a single paragraph.  There are long stretches of simple activity and little dialog.  However, the emotional and visual content convey volumes.  The black and white filming conveys a greater sense of substance, history, and most of all art.  This movie is an art piece after all.  In many ways the movie is also just as informative as a slice of early American life - as it is informative about Abraham Lincoln.  However, my guess is the artsy approach will put off many viewers so you need to know what to expect going in.  The performances are all outstanding.  I don't think there is much Brit Marling has ever been involved with that isn't beautiful and intelligent.  She doesn't have much dialog in this movie though.  Diane Kruger is also outstanding as is every member of the cast.  But again, strict historians may not find everything they are looking for in this film.",1424390400,42,3295,4.667826086956522
6936725,4,B00RYZFNZG,"This is excellent film, I love the way they shot it - not a lot of dialogue. It certainly gives one a better understanding of what life was like in rural America, and especially what helped form a man like Abraham Lincoln. Very moving.",1424390400,,235,4.363636363636363

6936730,4,B00RYZFNZG,Visually stunning and exceptional acting but the movie does drag at times.  this is more of a film about frontier life in America in The 1830s then a backstory about Lincoln's childhood. The young Abe Lincoln serves little purpose other than as a witness to the struggles of his family and how they coped with these struggles.,1482883200,,326,4.719298245614035
6936731,4,B00RYZFNZG,I would have given this unusual film five stars if I had not found some of the filming technique disconcerting to watch at times. I grew up around many thing Lincoln and have always had an interest in his life. The boy playing young Abraham was understated and very natural in his acting. Overall a moving and very good production.,1482710400,,331,4.533333333333333
6936732,5,B00RYZFNZG,"A poem of sight and sound, with compassionate realism that transcends the ""realism"" of the most cynical, gritty filmmaking; The Better Angels is as accurate as personal memory, and as evocative, whatever its intention in terms of politics.

6936743,5,B00RYZFNZG,"This isn't a typical historical film, so instead of facts, it gives you rather an overall impression of Lincoln and his family. Impression is the best word I can use to describe it, and if you think of this type of film as correlative to an impressionistic painting, you wouldn't be too far off. It is beautifully filmed and directed, and even if you're not interested in Lincoln, you can appreciate it simply for the artistic story-telling that it is. Malek uses a wide array of classical music for his soundtrack; uses choppy, close-up shots to make it more realistic; and films some incredible scenes of nature and light, letting them speak through their roles as much as the actors (who are incredible by the way, and many of the children had never acted before). He also chose a minimal script, where you get bits and tidbits of conversations and have to guess at the rest -- again, it's an impression. Perhaps my favorite thing is the fact that it's filmed in monotone colors, adding a soft timelessness that speaks straight to the heart.",1469923200,,1044,4.679347826086956

6936761,5,B00RYZFNZG,"This is what cinema is also about, sound, images, simple editing, sensibility for the sake of sensibility as everything can be expressed also without words, a light voice over narration to keep us somehow tight to a story. More than a story it is about moments that may make a story. Knowing that it is the story of Abraham Lincoln does not help to the movie itself, but enrichs our historical perspective of America, so I would not think it is necessary, but now you know. ;)",1454976000,,476,4.482758620689655

6936768,5,B00RYZFNZG,"When I saw the film had been produced by Terrence Malick, I jumped. Surrounded by an entertainment industry that is hyperactive and frenetic, Malick manages to bring us back, every time, to what matters. That is, he offers this to us. He offers to move us to a deeper place, a place governed, simply and magnificently by the beauty of the earth, the devastation of loss, and the enduring bond of love as seen through the eyes of the soul. The negative reviews speak far more to our society than to the genius and power of this remarkable film. Our youth are bored to death unless they are texting, tweeting, and gaming all at the same time. The idea that one can be transfixed by a simple raindrop, a shaft of sun, a blade of grass: this is as foreign to contemporary habit as the feel of the earth in one's hands. We have obviously lost our way. I am grateful beyond words for Malick and director A.J. Edwards for helping point us in the right direction again in this monumental tribute to young Lincoln and the women who influenced him so deeply. We can fidget and complain and say the whole thing moves too slowly for our overstimulated and jaded sensibilities...or we can sit back and breathe again.",1452988800,2,1203,4.497716894977169

If I were to be critical which I can't really seriously... the movie which is in black and white is relentlessly... dank. The world is wet and gray, but the spiritual purity is imparted with sincere artistic joy. This will remind you of a filmmaker... who just happens to be the producer.

6936859,3,B00RYZFNZG,Not a lot of dialogue. Seemed like they hardly ever talked to one another which I'm sure was not the case.

The title refers to the two mothers in Abraham's youth--how blessed he was to have their formative love.  You get some potent insights into the youth of Abraham Lincoln--none of which ""solve"" the mystery of this incredible man. Yet, one finishes the movie with a deeper sense of the older Abe.  The boy who plays the young Abraham is fantastic!",1442102400,,440,4.84

Some reviewers suggest that this film is badly done because it doesn't emphasize an informative approach to the life of Abraham Lincoln.

This film won't use facts to tell you WHAT to think. Art doesn't do that. Rather, it aims to engage you in the story through abstract elements like expression and emotion that might provoke your ideas and thoughts. For many, this deepens the viewing experience. Other viewers could feel lack of engagement or feel lost by the lack of clear direction.

The only other film I could compare this with is The Thin Red Line, which was directed by Terrence Malick and is also historical, based on world war II.",1442016000,,718,4.774193548387097

If the summary was to show how difficult life was in those early years, it succeeded. Mostly it is fiction and not much fact. Period costuming was well done well. Filming in black and white is always more dramatic.  Other than those points not worth watching the characters just circling the drain with barely any dialog between them to explain the context.

I tried to at least listen to it but there wasn't enough legible dialogue (narrator and father characters accents and voices sounded like grunting) to even be able to stomach it. I'm really frustrated with these PRETENTIOUS film makers who try to be avant garde by using all this lame visual crap that distracts from the story and ends up making it un-watchable. I don't want to look up the entire casts nostrils for any reason what-so-ever. Nor am I interested seeing everyone from only the waist down including intimate shots of a slobbering ox. Save the black and white too, wtf? Just stop. There's something very self involved about shooting this way. It's like they get so caught up in there 'art' that they don't think of those of us that have to sit through 1.5 hours of it.

Unfortunately the movie was extremely slow and the insightful content on the early years of Abraham Lincoln that I had hope for was simply not there.  The chance to delve into the character of Lincoln as a boy during his formative years was wasted because the director seemed to want to create a visual as opposed to a cerebral film.

The film had more of an ephereal feel as opposed to a realistic feel. For me it was too mystical and mythical instead of a true character study.

I did however head to Barnes and Noble to purchase a biography on Lincoln that explores his boyhood years.  Hopefully the book that I purchased will do a better job at it than this film did.",1439164800,,777,4.4822695035460995

6936952,2,B00RYZFNZG,"I like history but this portrayal of Abraham Lincoln's childhood was very poorly written and directed, the camera work was shoddy, and the narration was pitiful. The small amount of dialogue made it hard to understand what was going on. The camera work is horrible with shots from wierd angles and closeups that are annoying. It's like someone took an iPhone back to 1817 and tried to make a home-made reality show. And what was the point of filming in black and white? The grass was just as green in 1817 as it is now.

The movie moves so slowly that you ache for some action. It's almost painful. Not only is it slow but the script and directing hardly make you feel anything for the characters, if you can even figure out what's happening to them. As an example young Lincoln gets whipped for taking the blame for doing something wrong and you just couldn't care less.

I've watched far better films on Lincoln. If this film wasn't about Lincoln and was just about any other kid growing up in the woods in 1817, this movie would be an absolute dud.  All three of us watching had several debates about whether we should give up on it or not but I endured this disaster all the way to the end hoping that I would actually learn something worth the waste of my life.

If you are curious like I was, I think it's worth checking out, but if you are interested in this film for entertainment purposes, skip, skip, skip this film.

Inspiration should supersede imitation. Somehow I finished watching The Better Angels, but I'm only left wondering if A.J. Edwards is actually capable of making a film, because this one only shows that he can imitate every shot that Terrence Malick has used. There were numerous shot-for-shot similarities, including similar lines of dialogue (talking about plants and kids growing up simultaneously, and a father teaching his sons to fight). The Better Angels was more overtly religious (than say The Tree of Life), and it could have been interesting if the visuals wouldn't have been so overwhelmingly boring. Another thing that stood out to me were the use of voice overs. Terrence Malick uses them for prayers and reveries, but Edwards used them here for exposition, and that was to a detriment.",1436400000,,1136,4.8860103626943

You read the Top Billed Cast on IMDB and there are leading ran capable actors in 20th place. I I know Malick let his protg direct it, which us cool. I looked up filming locations and they didn't stray far from school; it's filmed in New Psltz, NY. This is where so many people in the film industry got their training.  USB PURCHASE in New Paltz. They hardly had to leave campus! That is handy. I don't like the film. Jason Clarke dies not impress me; Brut Marking is very ubderrated.

One example is that the games the children played seemed very accurate for those times.  The style is a departure from what we are used to seeing in movies.  Those were harsh times to live in.  Not enough of a student of Lincoln to know if the events depicted are historically accurate or not, but what we see makes it seem like plausible, whether or not the events were accurate.  I expected more of a documentary.  Not sorry I saw the movie, but the overall effect left me feeling somewhat unsettled.  Perhaps that was the intent.",1432944000,,688,4.581967213114754

6937061,5,B00RYZFNZG,"Although this film is slow, black-and-white, has almost no plot and only scattered dialogue, I found it engaging from first to last. It is a beautifully artistic drama evoking 3 years of Abraham Lincoln's childhood with his isolated pioneer family, during which his beloved mother dies and he acquires a stepmother who emotionally takes her place.

It is a film that suggests the vulnerabilities, openness, and randomness of childhood, the indelible, invisible imprint made by the few people closest to the child, the reality of setting, and, again and again, the deep, subtle influence of mothers on sons.

It is a strangely moving mixture of realism, art, and tenderness, not to be taken as history. In a scene that impressed me, the parents have a rare, taciturn conversation of few words in which the mother says the boy should be sent where he can get educated. The strict, independent father objects that the boy will learn more on the farmstead than at school. Then there is a long pause, after which their whole relationship unfolds before you as he gentles, looks away, and admits, ""Well, you know best.""

Not for everyone, ""Better Angels"" was produced by Terrence Malick, who made the wonderful (but not for everyone) ""Tree of Life,"" a film that similarly unfolds visually, in a slow series of seemingly random scenes that slowly add up to something hard to explain.

The musical score is exquisite.",1432339200,,1409,4.932489451476793
6937062,4,B00RYZFNZG,"Deeply moving.  It is presented as a boy would remember his young life. Therefore, it is obscure and disjointed like memories are. It took awhile to warm up to the style.

Afterwards, he was even prompted to do research and look up the history of Abraham Lincoln's life.  It is filmed in black and white and I respect the director's decision to do this -  brilliant!  Very little dialogue but some unforgetable quotes like ""She lived more yonder than here"".  During the whole movie, I just kept thinking how extraordinary that one of the greatest presidents came from such a disadvantaged upbringing with such harsh living conditions.  But then again, those very trying circumstances probably made him the exceptional man  that he was.  I also strangely loved the director's obsession with trees.  So what did I really think?  Well, this movie made me ""think"" long after it was over.  It made me think how truly blessed I am.  It made me grateful that my life is ""NOT"" that hard.  I don't have to plant corn with a plow and mule or wear make shift clothes or live in a cold house.  It made me wonder how integritous men like this achieved so much with so little back then and today with so much advantage it is hard to find this kind of integrity and grit anywhere in our society.  That is what I loved most about this movie - it made me think!  I also recommended it to a lot of people which is something I rarely do after seeing a movie.

6937090,5,B00RYZFNZG,"Striking video to show us the conditions in Indiana while Abraham Lincoln was a young man, trying to help his family make a home in an area that was mostly still wilderness...Tom Lincoln, Abe's father, was a strict man, but hard working. He eventually became one of the most successful and wealthy settlers, but the effort to achieve a livelihood was more difficult that we can even imagine today.  That is what makes this film so valuable. It brings to us the reality of the immense effort it took for our predecessors to build this nation with primarily bare and intense  human effort.

Gaining an education through books and a talented teacher were key elements in forming the character and personality of our seventeenth president, and I never really appreciated the day to day struggle of that time in our history until I watched this rare video.

Another valuable insight offered by this video is the tremendous influence of Abraham Lincoln;s mother, Nancy Hanks, and after her death and the marriage of Tom to a widow, we can gather from this story the important influence of these two women on the man who was to be instrumental in making slavery a thing of the past in our nation. these two women faced heavier work loads than any of us can imagine today, yet found the time and energy to encourage a youngster to learn all that he could.  This trait was just one of Mr. Lincoln's most important personal assets in his public career and especially as our president.

We need more videos like this to help us to appreciate what we have in the United States of America,  and to encourage us to preserve those values today.",1431302400,,1629,4.635416666666667

6937129,2,B00RYZFNZG,"SPOILER ALERT.  I AM GIVING AWAY THE PLOT HERE SO READ NO FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW HOW IT ENDS (or if you never studied 4th grade history). I think you will LOVE it or HATE it.  I fall into the latter category.  I gave it 2 stars but ONLY because it was interesting to look at a portrayal of poverty stricken settlers in the 19th century.  This did not relate much to my understanding Abe Lincoln, however.
It was a little hard to follow until I got into the director's particular ""style"" of telling the story. It is black and white (more drama that way you know) and primarily (although not totally) narrated by an older cousin. When I got used to how they were telling the story, it was just slow to follow. (This is where the other reviewers use terms like ""it is visually stunning"" and ""an art piece"") The history is pretty off the mark. They used the same kid of about 11-13 (ish) throughout to tell the story.  Shows him living in abject poverty and squalor.  This is NOT my understanding of Abe
Lincoln's early life - poor, maybe...but not like this portrays.  His Dad, while saying in the story ""he was a good man"" was portrayed as really kind of a jerk. Abe loved his mom who is sweet but ignorant, she died..never quite certain why, (gotta love the crazy guy stumbling around saying ""Were all gonna die, we're all gonna die"") Maybe from contaminated water??? They never said how that happened by the way... Or maybe it was the milk sickness? because I am CERTAIN that KNOWING the water was contaminated they would have given it to the cow and then drank the sick cow's milk. (Ummmm....not so much)  Anyway, mom's dead,  dad remarries, Abe grows to love is step mom who also sweet, not learned, but seemed to have more on the ball than birth mom.  Then he goes to school has a reasonable teacher who seems to appreciate Abe's brain, and then, without preamble, the narrator is telling you he had to tell Abe's (step) mother ""they"" shot him and she didn't talk for three days. Then it ends - no not ends is not the proper word, it just stops.  Yes, that would be more accurate.  It was as if they ran out of money to film it.  It kind of left me with nothin'  I never quite caught on to what the association was to the title or what the mother's actually taught him...other than to behave, like any other mother on the planet would. Maybe they should have researched Abe's father more or his financial history a little better, or maybe the movie should be renamed  ""Abe Lincoln's Early Life as portrayed by Salvador Dali"" and leave the title association to ""the angels and mothers"" out of it. Or, maybe I am just not avant garde enough to appreciate it...which is weird, because I actually ""get"" Salvadore Dali!!!!!",1430438400,,2732,4.414342629482071

The few joys and moving experience he found with the women that came into his life helped shaped him to become a man of great compassion and understanding.

Hands down the best movie about Abraham Lincoln yet made.  Spielberg's pales in comparison.

Evocative, stirring and ultimately a moving experience to watch.  It transports you.  Dealing with several of the most formative and fragile years in Lincoln's life with extraordinary realism and accuracy, it moved me beyond words.  I felt as though I were really there, not just viewing this film but somehow traveling back in time to be with the Lincoln's and this feeling only became stronger throughout my viewing.  Seemingly new camera angles that are natural and perfectly fitting, masterfully shot in black and white, sound that stirs one's emotions and a soundtrack that struck home with each note.

The cast was spot on!

The two most important women in Lincoln's life are depicted, for the first time in film, as far as I know, in such a sublime heart-felt manner that I struggle to find the words to describe their honest, loving portrayal.

And Thomas Lincoln, for once, has been given his proper due.  His vital part in shaping Lincoln's character has been sorely overlooked and given short-shrift for decades.

Thank you to the film makers for getting it right for once.  A timeless masterpiece!  It has no equal!",1429056000,2,1250,4.91866028708134

The use of devices like the screen going black, repeated sounds of rushing water, and views of light coming through the treetops contributed something to the artistry, but exactly what it was escaped me.

Whether Lincoln is your primary interest or if you are open to insights about life on the prairie and the emotional and familial hardships that were part of this difficult life, this film is wonderful.

The movie is entirely black and white (or slightly sepia maybe.) The use of light and cinematography are excellent. It reminded me a little of There Will Be Blood in this regard, but it's a different cinematographer. There is not a lot of dialogue in this movie. And the pace is slow....so definitely not for everyone.

The movie only covers Lincoln as a young boy and focuses on the very meager upbringing he had. There is none of his prowess with an axe or his feats of strength in the movie (which I was hoping for.) It seems the intent was to show his character and where he got it from. The story is from the point of view of his cousin and is told after Lincoln has died, but there is not a ton of narration.

6937323,4,B00RYZFNZG,"What a truly wonderful, historical drama on one of the greatest men to ever live, Abraham Lincoln. This is a surprisingly awesome and utterly brilliant, black and white, biography on the young life of Lincoln growing up in the wilderness of Indiana. You get to experience this harsh way of life through a realistic setting that transcends off screen, as believable and reality based. Directed and written by A.J. Edwards, which I am shocked and amazed, that this is his first feature length film as director. He did a stunning and amazing job. He made you believe the story and crafted it in a way, that comes to life off screen and makes you feel, as if you're a part of what is happening.

This has some amazing actors and actresses. The beautiful and stunning Diane Kruger who plays Sarah Lincoln. Diane is amazing and is one of those actresses that can truly own her part and give you a stunning realization of the character she is playing. I first got wind of her watching the wonderful, and sadly canceled television show, The Bridge. She aces the part of Sarah Lincoln. Also starring another amazing actor, Jason Clarke; he plays Tom Lincoln. Like always in his acting career, he is able to become the part and makes you feel as if you are there with the character. Simply put he makes the part come to life. The other stunningly beautiful lady of the film Brit Marling, is excellent as the role of Nancy Lincoln. She graces the part with genuine believability of her character. She seems effortless in the part.

Now I must speak highly on a gifted actor. This being his first role. His first acting experience. I was blown away by this extraordinary young man, playing Abe Lincoln. Braydon Denney is golden in this part and I cannot wait to see him act in more parts. I hope he has a long career in this field, because what I saw through this role, is something Hollywood sadly is lacking a lot of this day and age, and that is the very definition of actor. Braydon Denney aces this part and defines what great acting is about through emotion, moods, gestures and a complete owning of his character.

The whole cast is wonderful. The film feels, original and unique and places you there in the time period and makes you want to learn more about Lincoln. On a side note, my father named me after Abraham Lincoln and so his legacy and his truth has always been a part of my life. He was a man that needs to be remembered, and studied, and looked upon for every generation.

6937325,4,B00RYZFNZG,"This was a unique twist in a film about Lincoln. I know as a boy he was very quiet and shy...which often in childhood calls for alot of teasing by peers & also scapegoating within the family unit. I was uncomfortable watching this film personally because I was alot like Abe as a child. I was the child in our family of 3 girls who only was given the belt or switch...for reasons I will never know. It was common place to physically reprimand children in Europe & early America. Unfortunately both my parents are from the Great Depression  Era & both had been victims of extremely overbearing & abusive parenting. The proverbial ""Children should be seen & not heard"" continued from my parents, parents right into how my own father saw fit in raising children. I give 4 stars cuz I really think that more development of the severely intense characters of the women who raised Abe, needed expansion. There was too much sauntering through the fields & meadows without some real personality features for example...in his mother who was simply this woman who just floated literally in perpetual melancholy. I do know that Abe Lincoln suffered chronically from clinical depression through out his life. I do believe that his mother as well suffered from ether depression or in fact a mood disorder like ""Melancholy"" As an RN, I do know that unfortunately just like heart disease & diabetes...mental illness is inherited...passed from generation to generation. This was indeed a creative and visually stimulating film that worked to portray in black and white cinema...the gripping sadness of Lincoln's boyhood drenched in multiple losses.",1428192000,,1632,4.956204379562044

6937330,4,B00RYZFNZG,"It's no surprise to get a feeling of wistfulness in a movie associated with Terrence Malick.  And this movie is loaded with a wistfulness that almost borders on ennui, though it never fully surrenders to that.  It's all about a young Abe Lincoln during an age when he should have been attending grammar school, and the travails of living an impoverished, rural existence.  It's also supposed to be about his relationship with his mother, than later, his step-mother.  He is treated well by these women, and fortunately for Abe, since his father's boorishness was enough to twist the mind of any young lad into something that could have had devastating results years later.  We know of course, at least above Mason-Dixon, that Abe turned out to be fairly decent, and, yes, the woman-folk in his earlier life may indeed have played a role in that.  Though it was difficult to visualize the awkwardness of the older Abe within this young actor, who was anything but gaunt, there was a kind of poetic beauty in this movie that made it dream-like, a sparse reverie of a bygone time.",1428019200,,1077,4.732620320855615

6937336,5,B00RYZFNZG,"I found this movie to be very moving and beautiful.  It is sparse, but remember it is told in somewhat of a looking back way through the eyes of a young man who is now older and recollecting.  If you grew up in the Midwest midst the prairies and tall cottonwoods and sycamores- it feels magical to be among those memories, vividly portrayed by the camera work.
My opinion may not be totally as objective as other's as my Grandmother was a Lincoln scholar, lecturer and tour guide.  Her experiences in knowing the man through historical documents and actual items gave me a broader picture of Abraham Lincoln.  I often frequented my Grandmother's workplace, touching the artifacts, hearing the stories that each represented.  I wrote her elegy, including this quote from Abraham Lincoln; ""It is not the years in our life but the life in our years that matter.""  She lived this quote well, as did our gracious finest president.
I highly recommend this movie if you are open to a new view, fine cinematography, intimate and plain spoken dialogue and narration.  Beautiful, I will watch it again for it's peaceful nature and expression of what aided and perhaps, strengthened the perspective of Mr. Lincoln..",1427068800,6,1204,4.84390243902439

6937340,5,B00RYZFNZG,"Though Terence Malick's name is connected to this film it is definitely fledgling director A.J. Edwards' show.  Malick's influence is apparent but Edwards demonstrates enough unique flourishes to distinguish this work as his own.  Described by some as an art film I would characterize it as an exercise in artistry.  An art film connotes that watching this film is akin to viewing a museum piece which Edwards' film certainly is not.  The film is brimming with life appropriate to its early nineteenth century rustic setting.  Technically the film is a marvel with luxurious black-and-white cinematography, crisp editing, and evocative sound design giving you the you-are-there effect.  The beauty of the film is its technical proficiency doesn't overwhelm the actors who are uniformly excellent.  Though the adult performances (Jason Clarke, Diane Kruger, Brit Marling, Wes Bentley) are terrific the focal point of the film is young Braydon Denney as Abraham Lincoln.  Denney exhibits strength and stoicism in a turn that belies his tender years.  It's not only possible but plausible that this boy would grow up to be the  Great Emancipator.  If I were to quibble it would be that some of the characters speak of young Abe in messianic tones usually under hushed breath.  Some may fault the film as taking liberties with history but accounts of Lincoln's early life are somewhat speculative.  I think what is paramount is the essence be captured and niggle about the details later.  I'm glad this film was made and hope a wider audience gets a chance to see it.",1426550400,9,1563,5.0546875

6937344,1,B00RYZFNZG,"I rate this movie as poor.  First the historical visuals are laughable.  The women wear makeup and have great hair.  Life in rural southern Indiana in the early nineteenth century was brutal.  The difficulty in just living would show on all these people as it showed in photographs of Lincoln in his later life.

Second there is absolutely no story development.  The movie is basically of young Lincoln looking at flowers; or his birth and step mother stoking his face.  There is not much more than that in the movie.  But there was a couple scenes of young Lincoln playing with other kids.

Third, Lincoln, and the others, never age in the movie even though it supposed to be over multiple years of Lincoln's life.  In the later part of the movie some makeup could have been use to make the actors look older and camera angles to make the young Lincoln look taller.

Lincoln's actual childhood life is very interesting but this movie made it just plain boring.",1425513600,4,961,4.627218934911243
6937345,3,B00RYZFNZG,"Stylistically, this film is very interesting and at times moving.  Nice performances, nice camera work.  The costumes left a bit to be desired (no, no elastic in 1817, and people wore shoes in the woods, believe me).  I have mixed feelings about the black/white: while I understand the filmmakers' intent in using it, and I acknowledge that it adds an otherworldliness and sense of the past, it is a shame not to see color in the beauty of the woods and fields, which I think would have added realism and depth.  The film is quite beautiful overall, with a dreamy, poetic feel. The writing is wonderful.  However, I have one big issue that I couldn't get past:  shoddy research.  For example, women didn't walk barefoot or with shorter skirts, since for women at this time, to show ankles was worse than showing breasts - it would not have been done amongst Christian women, even settlers.  Secondly, Lincoln did not ""grow up in poverty"" as a few reviewers here now believe thanks to the film. Being a settler means you live without luxury, but it doesn't mean you live in squalor.  I come from two families of settlers - my great great grandmother, whose mother rode west in a covered wagon, pointed out to me once that no matter how much you lack, you can use a bar of soap.  Here in the film, we find food left on the table, dirt and leaves on the floors . . . I just don't buy it.  Even when the children are left alone, historical record tells us that Abe's 11 year old sister was quite capable of keeping house after the mother's death.  Children would have known how to keep clean and avoid disease, how leaving food out rotting would not only attract insects and rodents, but wolves and bears. Would not have happened.  Children worked harder and knew more about running a household than the kids in the film do: we have ample documentary and physical evidence of this. I was also a bit disturbed at the depiction of the father as semi-abusive - there is no evidence of that.  He was strict, but taught Lincoln a lot about being a man.  When Lincoln entered his mid-20's he found he had little in common with his father and they drifted apart; there was not animosity.  The father was active during Lincoln's upbringing in local councils and social matters - the family was not all that isolated. Nor were they poor: the father owned a substantial amount of land in Kentucky - although the film states they left because of social prejudice against the poor (laughable), they actually left for two reasons, as stated by Lincoln himself in his writings: the family was anti-slavery, and the father had lost land due to loose land rights legislation in KY.  He went to Indiana where the laws were tighter, slavery was illegal, and adquired land and livestock there.  The family were settlers, uneducated, and they were farmers - as was much of the country - but they were not living in poverty.  Lincoln didn't witness slavery first when stumbling upon a chain gang in the woods of Indiana of all places - he witnessed it as a young adult during a visit to New Orleans. In short, out of respect for Lincoln and his family, I wish the filmmakers had done their research more carefully.  However, the film does paint a wide-brush picture of pioneer life, and it can be seen as a tribute to men and women who carved a life out of a hostile wilderness, fought for civilization where they found none, reached for standards of education, preserved ideas of moral conduct, fought to end slavery, and ultimately built the early foundations of American society.",1425427200,46,3557,4.589257503949447

There are some of us who see life as more than just a simple story based on the cold hard facts. This movie is a profound dream made possible through the unspoken depth of someone like Lincoln (often only to be found in his most simple statements) and this is how the film makes it sublime possibility happen. . builds its profound magic/  a magic that comes to life through the dynamics of a childhood being lost and a manhood coming into being / There is no depiction here of the fast paced technological world of today's urbanized America/ But the flow of the story takes place in the lost Eden like paradise of an earlier America/ brought to life through the pain and natural divinity of the boy's two beautiful mothers/ / one who dies and the other who lives. . .
