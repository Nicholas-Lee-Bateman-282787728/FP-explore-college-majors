1375579,2,B00004Y7EW,"As a big Bronson fan I don't know what to think of these ""Family Of Cops"" TV movies. Did they really HAVE to make three ?. I don't think they had to, but unfortunately they made them anyway. The first one was o.k., and more than enough, but three is stretching it too far. -The old copper he portrays here is simply not interesting enough. Personally, I'd much rather have liked to see Bronson play two other final characters in two other final movies, than have this dull cop come back twice. (The father/daughter-relationship between Bronson and Dana Delaney in the TV movie ""Donato & Daughter"" would've qualified a lot better as a series of TV movies, actually.) I'm afraid absolutely nothing of interest to most Bronson fans happen in this series, and it's a bit of a shame he chose to end his acting career with this dud and not with a bang. It's not that I mind Bronson doing a bit of serious drama and less action, especially at his age, but the combination doesn't work here.  Also, the ""F.O.C."" movies suffer from the same problem many TV series and movies today face; they have too many characters, and not enough time to care about them.",987033600,9,1148,4.519230769230769

1375615,4,B00004Y7EW,This DVD was a gift for a friend who had the first 2 films. I've seen all 3 and I'am a Charles Bronson fan as well. I liked this film but it did not wow me as much as the first 2 films did. I believe this was one of Charles Bronson's last movies filmed. It's good for a one-time watch in my opinion. It does not compare as well to the Death Wish series or many other films he played in. I recommend it to those who liked the first 2 movies in this series just to complete the set.,1389139200,3,480,3.762376237623762
1375616,5,B00004Y7EW,"The series of
family of cops
family of cops 2
family of cops 3
are all very good family movies
Charles Bronson is the head of the famil and he does a great job in these movies
for a man coming from a family of 15 children he surely is due a great audiance for acting

1375617,5,B00004Y7EW,"Ok I own up to this, I have a huge soft spot for this trilogy & while part 3 was Mr. Bronson's last screen appearance, it really holds up. If you watch this as many times as I have, you can see the supporting cast helping him along & I find that even more touching.  Full frame film, no surprise as it was a TV movie.

Interesting enough story & fine performances by everyone involved.

So long to 1 of the all time movie greats.  A touching finish to a magnificent career in films.",1255651200,6,482,4.095744680851064
1375618,3,B00004Y7EW,"I had no expectations to even enjoy this movie based on other (rather few though) reviews.  I purchased all three movies because I really like Sebastian Spence.  I bought the first two in the box set, and then this one much later.  I liked III much better than II.  My mom always loved Charles Bronson so personally that was really nice to watch him as I was a bit young to see any of his movies in the theater.

I really liked the interaction between the family members especially son Eddie and dad.  Sure, some stuff was silly, but I am far from unhappy owning this and the other two DVDs.",1239840000,,591,4.2792792792792795

One can almost feel the heat from the scene lamps. Lack of care, probably due to lack of a view, lack of consciousness.",1504656000,,295,4.363636363636363
