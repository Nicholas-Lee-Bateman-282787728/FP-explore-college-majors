5553067,5,B00B2DGYS6,I am giving it a 5 star rating because I think it is a great movie and don't want to penalize ratings due to possibly faulty media.  I will leave it to others to get into the details about the movie.  I purchased this movie about a month ago on Amazon and was able to watch it fully in my Sony Bluray player without problems. Now I bring it to a friend's home to watch it and it freezes after about 40 minutes of play.  This was on a Toshiba DVD player. We then tried in my friend's desktop PC and same thing at the same spot. Tried on a laptop and same results.  Then tried at another DVD player (a Samsung DVD/VCR combo) also at my friend's house and it doesn't even read the disk. Still need to try at my own computer but I am away from home at the moment.  Anyone else had problems with this DVD?,1374019200,3,800,3.975

5553069,4,B00B2DGYS6,"This suspenseful, eerie and elegant film from Puerto Rico isn't easy to describe but it's well worth the watch. It's scary but not strictly horror, it's profound but not strictly art-house, it's a Puerto Rican film that is only about Puerto Rico in a metaphorical way. This is not your typical haunted house film, the horror isn't obvious to the casual viewer. In a fascinating way, ""The Condemned"" methodically proves to be a meditation on the curse of people who forgo their individual responsibilities and blame others as a shield.

Interestingly, the film immediately disposes with the traditional ""mystery"" in genre films: from the beginning we know that there is a dying, celebrated doctor who did terrible things in the past. Some may be turned off by this bold decision: I found it to be the key to the wonders of the film. This isn't a story about what happened, but about the terrible world that was created by the decisions (or lack of decisions) of those involved in or affected by those actions. It's not every day that a haunted house film tells you ""the secret"" in the first twenty minutes. In this case, it was refreshing and rewarding. Once we know this, the true horrors of the story start to emerge.

All the elements of the film seem to be orchestrated to lead the audience to the story behind the obvious genre conventions. Complementing the splendid art direction, sound design and photography, the actors were perhaps the main asset in injecting  the necessary dose of drama and humanity into this metaphorical thriller. Though, the leading actress, Cristina Rodlo, has an imposing screen presence, it's the stellar supporting cast (Monclova, Anderson, Font, Venegas) that truly adds depth and layers to the story.

Director Buso Garcia and his team seem to have had a singular vision for the film--and they kept to it.  From the non-traditional soundtrack to the detached, monochromatic visual style, the film is very sure of itself. Obviously, ""The Condemned"" is far from perfect: there are some unexplained moments in the film and some people may be turned off by the subtle plays on genre. Not all of the film's set pieces work as they should and a few scenes could've used a stronger dramatic thrust.

Still, I found the film memorable in that it stayed with me-- the more I think about it, the more resonant it becomes. As a ghost story, it's a reflection on the destructive power of silent collaboration and the dangers and irreparable consequences of denial. The most resonant and inescapable horror of all, lies within and the ones we love--gripping stuff. If you're looking for a suspenseful, thought-provoking film that defies easy classification, this is the film for you. 4.5 Stars.",1368576000,6,2718,4.897826086956521

8561376,1,B00B2DGYS6,"Subtitled horror film. I read line after line till the ending & wasted precious time. True, it did have a horrible twist at the last, but if you are not Spanish speaking, fiind another movie on Prime that you won't b tied to & can not blink an eye during the entirety of the film. NOT recommended!",1515801600,3,297,4.228070175438597
8561377,5,B00B2DGYS6,"Haunting film with an unexpected twist. Very compelling. This film takes its time telling what ends up being a horrifying story, so if you're looking for scares and lots of action, be warned that it might not be your cup of tea.",1515283200,2,228,4.4523809523809526

8561380,5,B00B2DGYS6,"'The Condemned' ('Los Condenados') gives us nothing interesting to look at (location-wise or acting-wise), and indifferent pacing.... but, thankfully, it gives us a twist that, besides being unintentionally funny, suggests that people who suffer abuse, and / or end up having been deceived by people of authority, share the responsibility for what was done to them. I don't know about you, but I thought that was wonderful - it's as if a film made in Germany and financed by the German government sympathized with Adolf Hitler and suggested Jews shared the responsibility for their deaths. Magnificent stuff indeed. Be aware that the quote attributed to primerahora.com on the DVD case has been taken completely out of context (the reviewer did not like the film), but in this case I think it's OK. Also, the possibility of planted reviews is high - even if they have bought a DVD for the movie, but I think that's OK too. Highly recommended!",1385596800,,942,4.930817610062893
