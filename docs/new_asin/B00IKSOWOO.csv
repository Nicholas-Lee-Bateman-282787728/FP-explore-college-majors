8643137,4,B00IKSOWOO,"I was attracted to B.M.S. because I love documentaries of all kinds and this is a good documentary about the human condition more than it is about African American lesbians. I liked the audio and the camera work and I liked the fact that there was no background music which to me can be disorienting over time. I recommend this to anyone, not just the LGBT community. What I liked the most about it was the director N'Tyse (who is also a good author) decided to show both sides of the homophobia issue by including a religous mother who was struggling with her daughter's coming out and during and I thought her interview was deep.  In a nutshell,  the title was apt; the women were presented with their labels, but as time went on and you went beneath their skin, you saw and felt the pain that comes with the label.  I'm looking forward to seeing another documentary from her.",1414022400,,878,4.475
