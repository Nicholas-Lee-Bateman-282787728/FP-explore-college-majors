8147839,3,B000IZJQFM,This is a good documentary about the Yanomami! Of course the recordings are a bit old so don't expect high definition images but you'll have a good idea of how these people live in the Amazon Forest and as for me it transported me to the times before C. Columbus arrived to the new world so it helped me imagine how my ancestors lived in our forests!,1327708800,,350,4.2388059701492535
8147840,1,B000IZJQFM,Dated and not the most accurate accounting. Clearly some scenes are staged. I spent 6 months with this group years ago and teach anthropology. I will not show this again to my students.,1229126400,9,185,4.636363636363637
8147841,1,B000IZJQFM,This is a very interesting program but it is recorded on a DVD-R. The picture is only marginally better than the old VHS copy I had. Its just not worth 19.99 for a DVD-R as opposed to a newly made DVD.,1212278400,7,201,3.926829268292683
