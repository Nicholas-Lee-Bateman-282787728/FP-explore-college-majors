2008830,3,B0001KNHNQ,"This is one of the easiest The Firm videos I've seen. It's tough to even work up a sweat unless you add your own steps in-between the choreography. It's very slow. I wear a heart rate monitor when I work out and with most interval workouts (including The Firm) I'm at 150-170. With this workout, I'm barely at 138. I only use this one when I've really pushed myself that week and want something easy. This would be a good pick for someone wondering about The Firm. Easy introduction.",1106265600,2,483,4.438202247191011
2008831,1,B0001KNHNQ,"We have dealt with this company on a couple of occasions (giving them the benefit of the doubt the second time).  To date we still have not received the videos that we ordered (though they assured us they would arrive by Christmas), but they have charged our credit card.  Their customer service is severely inadequate and failed to provide any answers (other than giving us a tracking number for a product that has yet to be shipped).  We will not work with them again and warn others that dealing with this company may cause them similar problems.",1104537600,8,549,4.639175257731959
2008832,5,B0001KNHNQ,"When I finally graduated up to The FIRM workouts I wondered if I would ever be able to perform the exercises correctly and fluidly because they moved so quickly and the choreography seemed a little confusing, nevermind challenging.  Today I am the proud owner of 15 workouts and Calorie Killer may just be my favorite.  There is only one segment where I still feel like I have to read Nancy's mind because her cueing is off - but oh the joy when you get the routine down and keep up with the pace.  This workout is strictly cardio and lots of fun. Beginners, don't be intimidated! It might take some practice, but you will learn it and love it. Prepare to sweat and reap the rewards.  A definite must-have for your fitness arsenal.",1104451200,9,731,4.473684210526316
2008833,5,B0001KNHNQ,"I rented this DVD just to try it out and now it must become part of my fitness DVD collection. It is very fun and the time flies by. It is 45 minutes long, yet it seems faster than some of the 30 minute workouts I own.

Calorie Killer is led by Nancy Tucker. Nancy is not the most personable instructor at first, but she really grew on me. The best thing about this cardio workout is the variety. You will not get bored because she combines low-impact aerobics, step aerobics, and even sports drills. This workout uses the firm fanny lifter and sculpting stick. If you have a step of any sort and a broomstick or body bar, you could substitute those.

I am an intermediate/advanced exerciser and so I completed the workout but I was definitely drenched in sweat and ""asassinated some calories"", as Nancy puts it! A beginner would want to take it slowly, but there is an instructor who demonstrates beginner modifications, so I wouldn't say a beginner shouldn't buy this.",1102809600,7,970,4.537142857142857
2008834,5,B0001KNHNQ,I have Many of the Firm Tapes and this one is top on My list. This is not for people just starting out. it is long and hard.. However if you are looking for a video to add to your collection then this is the Firm Video for you.. Watch the Video first before you actually try to do it. you will find that you pick up much of the steps that way..,1102204800,9,344,3.7260273972602738
2008835,4,B0001KNHNQ,"I got this DVD as part of the expansion set for the BSS2 along with Firm Abs and Upper Body Sculpt.  Don't get confused by GoodTimes' packaging--this is the same Calorie Killer that came as an add on to the Body Sculpting System 2.  It's been repackaged as ""Fast & Firm Series Calorie Killer"" for the retail market.  You'll need the Fanny Lifter, but even though the workout calls for the Sculpting Stick, I view it as optional.  Use light dumbbells instead.  (You'll see why later in my review.)  It's a good workout, and a bit shorter at 40 minutes than some of the others.  Don't worry, though--you'll still have worked up a good sweat by the end.

However.

I don't care for the way she has the viewer straddle the step by just tapping down and up on the same side without alternating feet.  It's a good way to trip, espeically if you are fatigued.  I am a veteran of step aerobics and am in good shape, but I have almost taken a couple of really scary spills while doing this move on the 8"" step.  Nancy also appears to be at a loss as to how to use the sculpting stick effectively.  At one point, you're stepping onto the fully assembled 14"" fanny lifter and alternating the stepping up with a bicep curl, leaning the stick from side to side, and then bending at the hips, just holding the stick.  The other instructors that use the stick seem to have a better grasp of how to use it to enhance the workout instead of just carrying it around.  She also mistakenly reverses her ""go right/go left"" instructions several times, something I've seen almost all of the instructors do on my Firm DVDs.  (The Firm's penchant for doing everything ""backwards"" confused me a lot at first, since I've never had an aerobics instructor do that before.)

On the other hand, the choreography is fun and varied.  I like the addition of sports drills like the football run and the shuffle/shoot the basketball moves.  The boxing is just complex enough to make you feel really accomplished when you master the hop-turn move.

This is a good DVD, and I highly recommend picking it up to flesh out your collection of Firm DVDs.  It's just not quite my favorite.",1096588800,50,2145,4.47680412371134
2008901,2,B0001KNHNQ,"I own alot of Firm tapes and do Firm workouts about 5 times a week.  I got this video 4 years ago.  I hardly ever use it because I do not care for it at all.  First, it is way too easy for even an intermediate exerciser.  Your heartrate does not get up there much at all.  Plus, the choreography is lame!  I like Nancy but the other instructors behind her are not motivating by any means.  I love the Firm, but not this video!",1272844800,,426,3.9411764705882355
2008902,5,B0001KNHNQ,"I'm used to doing one thing at a time during my workout, so this was a nice way to add variation and challenge to my rotation.  Made up of several elements of aerobics and strength--with varying intensity--the workout moved along quickly from one thing to another with no chance for boredom: hi-lo on the floor; kicking up a sweat on the step, and pumping weight (that is, body weight, your sculpting stick, or dumbbells) with the tall box.  This relatively short routine had me on my feet the entire workout, and was easy (but fun) to learn. Rather than taking to the plastic robot (or doll) roll as an on screen instructor, Nancy exudes total professionalism, but manages also to appeal to viewers with a friendly persona.  I'm definitely going to give her other workouts a try soon.",1212624000,,785,4.673913043478261
2008903,2,B0001KNHNQ,"I just got this DVD yesterday, watched it on FF once, and then did it. As soon as I played it I thought ""man, I just wasted my money"", but thought maybe the looks were deceiving. Then I actually did the tape, and struggled for 20 minutes before I turned it off.
I don't admit to being in excellent shape but this tape was really lame. The instructor was really boring, all the others looked fake and none of them looked like they were getting a good workout either. It was like slow motion. I'm glad I didn't waste my money on the bar, I used hand weights. The energy of the workout was just off. The 'boxing' sequence made me laugh as none of them came close to actually looking like they were exerting any energy in the 'punch'. I got my heart rate up a bit with the cardio but never came close to breaking a sweat. I was very disappointed. Perhaps if I was having a really sore day this would be OK but I don't think I could handle the low energy of the routine regardless.
I wish I could have remembered the name of the Firm tape I had many years ago that totally kicked my [...] every time I did it.",1171324800,,1104,4.092165898617512
2008904,4,B0001KNHNQ,"""The Firm: Calorie Killer"" is a fun and highly effective aerobic workout that incorporates light weight (in the form of a sculpting stick) and a fanny lifter (basically two blocks that can be stacked on top of the other). If you don't have the sculpting stick, a regular household broom or barbell and set of light dumbells will work. And if you don't have their fanny lifter, a high step or foot stool will also work just fine. Set to uplifting techno-trance music, the choreography isn't overly complex although it is fast-paced, with lots of sports-oriented and some athletic dance moves. Despite one participant showing modified moves, I would consider this to be an intermediate level workout.

Nancy Tucker comes across as a clear and down-to-earth instructor - she doesn't radiate a whole lot of presence though, but at least she isn't obnoxious.

The main element of frustration with this workout, is both the needed equipment and how it is used in some parts. While you can certainly substitue the above mentioned items, I think the placement of the sculpting stick on the floor for many of the moves poses a tripping hazzard. Setting up and re-adjusting the equipment (particularly if you're having to use other items) can also be a hassle if you're trying to move on quickly from one exercise to the next.

However, this is a great cardio workout overall, with a proper warm up and cool down, which I'd definitely recommend - though perhaps more to already seasoned Firmies than to absolute beginners or Firm newbies. I would definitely consider myself to be a Firm believer, as they are some of the most effective workouts on the market and will quickly get you into shape.",1168732800,,1685,4.823529411764706
2008905,3,B0001KNHNQ,This workout was ok  I love the firm but I  don't really like the master instructors energy.,1168041600,,92,4.352941176470588
2008906,2,B0001KNHNQ,"I love The Firm! I own lots of The Firm videos and use them nearly everyday. This one is my least favorite. I don't have the Sculpting Stick & am not interested in purchasing it. I have The Fanny Lifter, The Firm Box, and my weights. In my opinion, the Sculpting Stick kind of seems like an additional piece of equipment you have to buy that you really shouldn't need in order to get a good workout.

I found myself tripping up a lot with this video.",1139875200,7,450,4.172413793103448
2008907,4,B0001KNHNQ,"Nancy Tucker leads this 45 minute video along with 4 fellow Firms master instructors, including Alicia who shows beginner/low impact modifications.  You will need the Firm's Fanny Lifter, though a regular step and stool will do if you don't have one.  They also use the Firm Sculpting Stick, again if you do not have this you can use a broom or mop handle, along with some light dumbells.  Although you could skip the weights too if you choose.

This video has nice variety, aside from the warmup and cooldown, there are 2 step segments, 2 low (or higher) impact segments (one of them uses the Sculpting Stick) and 2 tall box segments which use light weights and/or the Sculpting Stick, plus the Fanny Lifter.  The routines are fun and easy to follow, although there are some cueing errors, most notably in the last step segment which tends to throw me off, otherwise Nancy does a decent job leading.  I would consider myself to be intermediate level and I breezed through most of the workout pretty easily, the exception would be the first tall box segment where you use light weights, it really got my heartrate up there and was a bit challenging for me.  There is also a brief toning segment at the end using the Sculpting Stick, sometimes I will skip this section just to shorten it up as by this point I have already gotten in 30 minutes of cardio.

Overall this is a fun video, good for days that you don't want anything taxing but still want a decent cardio workout.  Recommended.",1137888000,6,1487,4.581132075471698
2008908,4,B0001KNHNQ,"This video is pretty good for a Firm cardio. My only real complaints are about their use of the sculpting stick on the floor being a safety hazard and I don't particularly care for this particular instructor; she seems too laid back for working out. I don't have a sculpting stick but I find ways around that obstacle. I don't feel the burn from this workout's floor segments unless I use heavier weights than they do, but then that's what Firm workouts are designed to do. Aside from that, the moves are mostly easy to follow once you catch on, and there is one samba track I enjoy. However, I wouldn't recommend this video for a complete beginner. It's over 30 minutes long.",1135814400,5,676,4.504065040650406
2008909,3,B0001KNHNQ,"While I love THE FIRM's workouts, this was not one of my favorites so far. Calorie Killer was not simple to follow; and I have little trouble following aerobic/step routines.

While the floor aerobic sections definitely get your heart rate up, I find the ease of transitions of movements, for maximum effect to be somewhat lacking. Some people may enjoy this video, but some of the moves were cumbersome and uncomfortable in their given patterns.

You also need their fanny lifter and stick for this routine as well.

The bonus is that you get a 30 minute quick calorie burner if you're in a hurry.",1117238400,10,598,4.6761904761904765
2008910,4,B0001KNHNQ,"I rented this DVD to see if I liked it. I am a FIRM fan and regularly do the BS2 series. I was looking for something to mix-it up a little and add variety, and that it did! I like the fact that it moves much faster than the videos that come with your set. I definitely work up a sweat with this one! Some of the step moves are a little confusing at first, but if you stop moving and WATCH the first time (instead of trying to keep up and tripping all over yourself) you can pick it up pretty easily.",1112227200,4,499,3.854368932038835

8013642,4,B0001KNHNQ,"With a running time of 39 minutes, including a 3-minute stretch, this is definitely one of the shorter workouts in the series.  Don't be mistaken, the workout does its job and provides a good sweat, it's just not as diverse or all-encompassing as their other workouts.
With alternating floor, step, and tall-box maneuvers, your heart rate remains up during the bulk of the workout.  My only caution would be that if you're on the shorter side (I'm 5'6""), that you do the 8"" step straddling carefully or your calves will be bruised.  If I'm not giving it my full attention I come away with several run-ins with the side of the step as I straddle it.

8013646,5,B0001KNHNQ,"I've had this DVD for years.  I used it during 2 of my 3 pregnancies to keep in shape and continue to use it today for a short but intense cardio workout.  It's probably my favorite of the BSS#2 DVDs.  I never use the sculpting stick, I always hold two 5 or 10lb dumbbells depending on which routine it is.  Compared to all the other BSS#2 DVDs I'd say this one is the toughest.  The step work is hard and it did take me a while to get it all down.  But even now that I know the moves by heart I'm still sweating like crazy and feel like my lungs are going to burst out of my chest when I'm done with it.  I also like that it's not super long and each routine is different.  I get bored easily with a workout and this one has always kept my interest over the years.",1343779200,,765,3.890322580645161
8013647,1,B0001KNHNQ,"Did not like it! I LOVE all the ""classic"" firm workouts but this one is hard to follow, too fast on the step and their facial expressions are over done to the point of irritation! After a while I just stopped, pressed eject and hopped on my treadmill for a 30 min workout!
