8037793,4,B000636HTE,"Taken from the popular animated series from the 90's, Spider-Man is in search of a way to either control or cure a condition caused by his own powers that is mutating him. He comes across Charlex Xaiver and his X-Men (its the X-team from the equally popular 90's series featuring Cyclops, Jean Grey, Wolverine, The Beast, Storm, Gambit, Rogue and Jubilee) and after a rough start, he finds that they can't help him but Beast points him to a Dr. Herbert Landon who supposedly can help his condition. What comes next is a fight between Spider-Man Vs. Wolverine (shades of their one on one fight in the famous Spider-Man Vs. Wolverine comic from the late 80's), an appearance from the Hobgoblin and the true nature of Dr. Landon's ""cure.""

One of the best episodes from the series! I only wish they would go ahead and put them on series sets for DVD! Worth getting if you can find it!",1225756800,,881,4.540880503144654
