7870709,5,6304158793,"A fantastic start for a fantastic series often overlooked by mecha/ anime fans. If you enjoy war stories, mech battles, less filler, and more action, than this series is for you. The pacing may seem weird at first, but it benefits the overall story and character development perfectly. There just isn't a mecha show more realistic than this one!",1420934400,,345,4.864406779661017

7870711,4,6304158793,"While in high school it enjoyed various anime shows, but had a real liking to gundam, now that I'm a lot older, and have tired of soapbox anime styles of late, I still have this collection and greatly enjoy it. Was always fascinated with the concept of an epic war story with a scifi setting (thinking saving private Ryan in the far future)which is why I come back to rewatch this series time and again. Of course it becomes unrealistic when the protagonist is a quiet ""man with no name"" and though mortal, put a weapon in his hands, or put him in a walking war machine, and he's unstoppable( wich is later explained in season 4).  The tech in this series isn't fantastical and for being in the far future is relatively low tech with much of the weapons used being ballistic type, and lasers can only be carried by the armored votoms and are still heavy and cumbersome for the machines. Some time the episodes,can appear to drag out, but the end of the series is a good payoff and has an intriguing twist, with some surprising supernatural elements that work well.",1396396800,,1064,4.484536082474227
7870712,5,6304158793,"Great post-galactic scale war story. With interesting battles and tactics, without robots doing flying ballerina moves.

If you're a fan of early Gundam, Mechwarrior/Battletech games, or just want some more realistic robot combat this is worth looking at.",1375315200,,255,5.7105263157894735
7870713,5,6304158793,"When is bought this series, I took a huge risk. All the comments from customers said it was a great series, and i was curious to find out. This show is not on Netflix or any streaming video service. I love mecha anime and good ones are very hard to find nowadays and at a good price. I found the whole 16 DVD set on amazon for only $60 and got it.

At first I was kind of disappointed that the audio was only in Japanese, but after watching the first four discs I moved on from it was able to enjoy the show with subs on. It is an awesome series full of action, and a very good story line. If you love good robot anime fights and are tired of the same dull shows that pass for anime in modern times than buy the whole series. Get it now while it's available. This is one of a kind and it is becoming very rare.

Sometimes with anime it's good to go old school. Very few modern anime can compete with classics like this one, gundam, robotech, transformers, etc.",1356998400,,960,4.0473684210526315
7870714,5,6304158793,"Sick of cowardly 14 year old mech pilots? Sick of beautiful people saving the world? Sick of seemingly invincible mechs decked out with dragon parts? Don't get me wrong this show isn't the most popular animes out there but what is? This show is very gritty with our heroes are fighting not to save the world (yet again) but for their very survival. The mecha in this anime is what inspired the Heavy Gear computer games. Our hero is an 18 year old mech pilot that know hows to fight and doesn't do dopey stuff. The mechanical designs are superb, they are very realistic and tank like, using mainly projectile weaponry so if you like Zakus you will like Scopedogs since they are both designed by the same person. This show isn't boring with half of each episode devoted to violent combat. Armored Trooper VOTOMS only flaw is it's old and the animation and music are dated, but for 14 episodes a pop it shouldn't be missed.",1153699200,4,921,4.520958083832335
7870715,4,6304158793,"I don't often review products here, but when I encounter something good and see that it has a fairly low rating, I feel compelled to give it a good review to balance the scale.  The only major complaint I've read in any review of VOTOMS is that the art and animation are poor, and maybe the music is a bit cheesey.  Those aspects of any show are so relative, though, that I cannot fault the show for that.  For example, many anime fans today would suggest shows like Full Metal Alchemist as an example of ""good"" art and animation, but, to me, that newer style is just so lifeless and cookie-cutter.  I prefer art and animation that is a bit off and different, and if you are like me, and you're tired of the same-old that it seems much of the current anime employs, then a little retro action may be right up your alley, which means VOTOMS' art and animation is just fine.  At any rate, regardless of the art and animation, the seriousness of the story is what really put the hook in me for VOTOMS.  Think Macross and Gundam, but without pop star girlfriends or conflicted teenagers coming of age.  This is a story about adults in an adult world who aren't conflicted at all about killing people who get in their way.  Tired, maybe, and world-weary, and even a bit cynical, but not conflicted.  And this is also a story about squat, mass produced, ugly mecha that don't look all shiney and bright or fly around defying the laws of physics or transform into cool fighter jets or whip out light sabers on each other.  These mecha are fighting machines, period, that give, and take, serious damage the old fashioned way, blasting each other with guns and missiles or pounding each other with their fists, and that break down and run out of ammo and do everything you would think a machine of war would do.  If all of this gets your blood pumping and mind racing with possibilities, then maybe, just maybe, VOTOMS is for you.",1144627200,13,1921,4.444444444444445
7870716,3,6304158793,"Video:*** ( aspect = 4:3, good transfer for a 20 year old classic.  Art and animation is good but old style - not for those whose love is great japanese art/ animation ).

Audio:** ( Dolby 2.0, nothing spectacular. Episodes' audio is kinda soft).

Story:**** ( Good story line. That's what you should buy this series for. It helps if you're into huge robots thrashing one another! Scopedog fans would already own this, right? :) ).

Extras:** ( Not much with the set, but it has an offer to get an extras DVD AFTER you purchase all 4 sets of the series ).

Value:*** ( It started alright at $26 bucks, but seems like amazon is raising the price?! (currently at $30) 1st episode is free for downloading for those who wish to sample VOTOMS ).",1144281600,2,740,4.411764705882353
7870717,4,6304158793,"Well, here is the first stage of Votoms. Judging by the lack of customer reviews here, this series has obviously been painfully ignored.
Too bad. CPM has the whole series out for our enjoyment, and it's subtitled only,  too!
First, the bad. This series is old, and looks it. The animation is  creaky, the drawings are pretty ugly, and the mecha do not have the flash  and pose of other mecha series, like the Gundam series.
On the other  hand, this is one of the, if not THE BEST plotted mecha series I have ever  seen. The ATs (mecha) have a rugged realism that tops other mecha because  they actually look like they were made to fight.
The story is heavy, but  great. Chirico Cuvie is betrayed by his comrades while on a secret mission,  but he lives to journey on to find out why. What follows is a sweeping  space opera across an alien galaxy filled with great characters, strange  romance, and gritty military action. Get it.",952128000,2,930,4.482142857142857
