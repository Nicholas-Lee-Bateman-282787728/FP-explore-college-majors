8089103,4,B000BMSUL8,"Known also as LA PRIMERA AVENTURA, this movie tells the story of Remigio, who has many little friends in the neighborhood (Juan, Mara, Chiquiln and his little dog Tano), and has been accused of taking money from the church. Remigio is helpless and the kids take matters in their own hands and set off to find the real culprit.

Doing so, they will not only risk their lives, but the dog's, who also had many dog friends and come to the rescue.

I am sure Nino del Arco was taken a little advantage of, it was probably not his idea, he was only 4-5 years old and innocent, but from his 8 movies, I have seen 6 and in at least 4 he shows his little butt.
Looks like an accident, but here his pants get torn off and he ends naked, in EL NIO Y EL MURO while dries himself with a towel, in LA GRAN AVENTURA, both him and Juliancito Bravo go skinny dipping, and I am sure KALIMAN saw it too...",1316908800,,887,4.091954022988506
8089104,5,B000BMSUL8,"This film was released so many years ago when the main actor, NINO DEL ARCO was only a child about 4 years old. His skills as an actor are remarkable. The story is tender, sad and happy at the same time and will move the audience. It is our good fortune to have this film on DVD. I was waiting this for a long time ago and I recommend it for both, children and adults.",1220659200,2,368,3.92
