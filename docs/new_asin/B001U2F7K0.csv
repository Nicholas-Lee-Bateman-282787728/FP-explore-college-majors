3795743,5,B001U2F7K0,"This DVD is the perfect answer for those skeptics who say you need to ""check your brains at the door"" in order to have faith. These three men are arguably some of the most intelligent I have ever heard, and they give excellent reasoning behind their faith in the true and living God of the Bible.",1237420800,20,296,4.303571428571429
3795744,5,B001U2F7K0,"It is said that only 25% of Christians entering college remain steadfast and strong in their faith.  The rest fall away as they are persuaded by humanistic, atheistic professors.  This DVD presents intelligent answers to the issues challenging Christianity today.  Makes a great gift for your graduating teen as they leave the safety of their Christian environment and enter into a world that opposes their beliefs.",1236643200,19,415,5.257575757575758

3795756,5,B001U2F7K0,"I recommend it. Dinesh DSouza, the author of Whats so Great About Christianity is the first of three speakers. Second is Ravi Zacharias who explains why God is more than a crutch, and then Dr. Norman Geisler speaks on the Inerrancy of the Word of God.",1410566400,8,251,4.478260869565218

3795760,5,B001U2F7K0,"First off, bit of info on the set. It comes with a DVD of teachings and an disc with bonus material that is MP3. I got nervous when I saw MP3 but the DVD played fine in my player, meaning it is a dvd.

Content--
Just what it says, excellent talks by some great apologists. Denesh, Ravi, and Norm G.
It's the first time I have seen Denesh speak, and he started out slow.....but within 2 minutes I was hooked. GREAT apologetic talk. Ravi was great as usual. Norm brings humor and great apologetics to the table as well. The talks take place at Calvary Cosa Mesa and the late Chuck Smith (started the Jesus movement and Calvary chapel....a life well lived) introduces Norm G. From what I can tell the talks take place around 09 because the financial crisis was mentioned. I loved every one of them!",1383523200,15,795,4.371621621621622
3795761,5,B001U2F7K0,It is a must watch. So informative. To see scholars at work proclaiming the christain faith from different perspectives. They use everyday language to convey important views.,1324598400,4,174,5.481481481481482
3795762,5,B001U2F7K0,"The three speeches are a thoughtful response of various speakers. One might not agree with everything said, but that does not negate the well thought thru many points made. Inspireing.",1322611200,3,184,5.166666666666667
3795763,5,B001U2F7K0,"Just buy it! Ravi Zacharias was outstanding. You will really gain insight into why you believe what you believe. All three speakers make it clear that you can be very intelligent, yet still believe in God. This DVD takes a very indept look at the solid philosophy behind Christianity. Norman Geisler was also excellent in explaining about the inerrancy of the Bible. If I could give this dvd 10 stars I would.",1264809600,32,409,4.694444444444445
3795764,5,B001U2F7K0,"These guys are using logic, facts, and the Bible to defend the Christian belief from skeptics.  Not only do they defend the faith, but they give reasons why they keep the faith in the midst of society's pressure to leave Christianity behind.  I was truly blessed by each message.  Ravi Zacharias was incredible!",1238025600,14,311,4.830188679245283

8342645,5,B001U2F7K0,"Had purchased to watch as a family with older and younger teens.  Very good.  Sessions a bit long so we broke it up but VERY good and relatable.  Much better than The Truth Project for teens which we found a little too technical and even dry.  Not so with this easy to understand, not in any way shallow, and completely applicable to every Christian.  Highly reccommend.",1434326400,2,370,4.545454545454546
