8063565,5,B0009NSE38,Years ago my husband and I got hooked into this series. It's cool in the suspenseful way. I will say they episodes are out sequence and if you look below at another review you will find the correct way to watch them and it works. Thanks. We have enjoyed the dvd and show again.,1231200000,,277,4.148148148148148
8063566,3,B0009NSE38,"I enjoy some pretty weird stuff when it comes to films, but this left me a bit perplexed.  Supposedly based on the famous ""American Gothic"" painting, but taken into David Lynch/Guy Maddin territory via Marilyn Manson videos, or SOMETHING...WTF?  Most of the time focuses on the old farmer from the painting, going on about once being a man but now, he's nothing...and there's some very disturbing imagery going on, which is the stuff of nightmares.  And I do like weirdness, but this was a bit too weird, even for me.  There's even some short films on the DVD, and I watched one, hmm, even weirder.  Definitely not for all tastes, and probably not for mine.",1224374400,3,657,4.678260869565217
8063567,5,B0009NSE38,"American Gothic is a modern art experiment that utilizes all mediums if you are tired of being offered a square, it's an octagon of creativity. There is a book of the same title that makes a great companion piece.

8063568,1,B0009NSE38,"I think Grant Wood's painting ""American Gothic"" created in 1930 is a great piece of art (not only American but in a world's scale). Having read the synopsis for this movie I thought it'd be something really interesting. I guess I was wrong. First you got to understand it's not quite a movie. It's more like a collage of photos and images put on industrial and death metal music. The movie is surreal and abstract unlike the painting itself. I doubt it's possible to understand anything watching it. Maybe some will be exclaiming ""Ingenious! Brilliant!"" after the film but then they have to be big connoisseurs of post-modernistic art. Carlos Batts is an acclaimed photographer, photography is his first speciality and I somehow missed it before buying this DVD. I think this film would be a nice part of some contemporary art exhibition, among some weird statues and installations. But to pay $23 for watching it at home - no, that's too much, and I'm talking not just about the money.

Don't say you haven't been warned :)",1131840000,8,1024,4.752808988764045
