8366162,4,B002DVAZTK,"This film is perfect for those who enjoy their thrills mixed with some humor. Three short stories, tied together with a wrap-around segment. Some technical flaws kept the first story from living up to it's full potential, but the editing worked to create the dread and uncertainty that i think the director was going for. The second story is carried by Vic Martino's over the top performance, and is perfect for those who love the slasher genre with a twist. The last story is a surprise, equal parts heartfelt social commentary, sarcasm, killing, and wackiness. The wrap around story ties the other three together well, and has a nice unexpected ending.
This film has lots of nudity, so if you're uncomfortable with looking at naked women, it may not be the film for you. For those of us who enjoy these types of non-hollywood productions, it is a treat. This would be a cool film to put in the DVD player at midnight on halloween, while you pig out on some candy!!",1254873600,3,966,4.622093023255814
8366163,4,B002DVAZTK,"This is Jim Haggerty's follow-up to ""Witchmaster General"" (actually, this one might have been first, but I saw it second). A lot of the same people are in this one - most notably Vic of 'The Sopranos,' the magician and the coroner (who is actually really good here as an old ventriloquist).

I always liked movies like this - 'Tales from the Darkside,' 'Creepshow,' etc. Movies that don't follow one story but branch out into different little stories. This one is really cool. Low budget but it gets the job done.

I became a fan of Jim Haggerty from ""Witchmaster General"" (because I wanted to see Phil Lewis from L.A. Guns acting) but I then ordered this because I liked that one a lot.

What I like about the movie most is its sense of humor. It's genuinely funny in an intentional sort of way. A lot of movies - especially low budget stuff - try to be all 'let's make a movie so bad that it's funny' and it always comes off lame. It just looks like a bunch of hipsters who think they're Ed Wood.

""Grave Danger"" doesn't fall into that trap because the folks in the movie know when to go over the top and when to play it straight. And every now and then it surprises you - like the really well acted and well-written scenes with the old man and his wife. It's actually pretty moving and I can't recall being moved by a movie in this genre.

But it's no 'Lifetime movie of the week' - it's all about the cheap thrills. And it delivers - there's blood, there's naked women, there's killer ventriiloquist dummies, badass cars, and creepy dudes in tuxedos! I have to say I really dug it. I see a lot of current low budget stuff and if it was all like this I'd probably quit my job and sit home all day watching them!

Also - AWESOME song over the closing credits. Is there a soundtrack album?",1250035200,3,1790,4.29673590504451
8366164,3,B002DVAZTK,"I like horror films.  At times, I like B horror films.

I think Grave Danger is a fun parody of them.  Jim Haggerty has taken a genre and played with it intelligently.

I like the acting.  Vic Martino is a hoot in the film.  I enjoyed his scene chewing.

A good time for all.",1250035200,4,275,3.9814814814814814
8366165,3,B002DVAZTK,"If you like cheap thrills, then this is a good movie for you.  There are three short scary stories linked together by scenes of a woman being harrassed on the phone by a man who wants to share horror stories with her.

The strongest of the three is the story of Phinneas the ventriloquist's dummy.  There's some really good acting in that one from the aging couple in need of money for their medical bills.  It tugs at your heart.  Then, it turns into a good old fashioned splatter film.  The fun kind we used to get in the 80's.

This is by no means a Hollywood production - so if you're looking for Michael Bay style explosions, you're barking up the wrong tree.  This is micro-budget film making.  But what the movie lacks in technical finesse and budget it makes up for by having clever dialog and a good old fashioned sense of fun.",1250035200,7,836,4.341935483870968
8366166,1,B002DVAZTK,"You don't have to judge this movie by its crappy cover art alone - one viewing will be the most excruciating cinematic experience you've had in a long time.

Poor dialogue, horrible cinematography of the most juvenile and hack kind, plus some obviously uncomfortable nude non-professional actresses shot in bad lighting with seemingly little or no direction are actually the highlights of the anthology.

The poorly conceived wraparound segments involve a very amateur actress being harassed via the phone by a weird crank caller who somehow convinces her to play a 'game' involving trading scary stories. he eventually convinces this poor girl to take her clothes off as well.

The 'segments' are mostly boring and somewhat nonsensical little movies involving a complete rip off of the 'Zuni warrior fetish doll' sequence in the TV anthology trilogy of Terror (except with a cheap African statue laying around the house accompanied by Native American repetitive music); a man who believes he is being followed by someone only to discover.... he is being followed; and a really bad rip-off of the 'killer dummy' idea used so many times before, even as far back as the original Twilight Zone series in 1960.

There's nothing original about this film; it's not well made, its not well though-out, and it doesn't offer any artistic or cinematic skill or care to the viewer;. Instead, its a cheapie made by a guy who doesn't have any film making skill who got his ordinary friends to 'act' in his film for free, and somehow convinced ordinary women to take their clothes off for him (may I note, that even though there is a sex scene in the film, no men ever take off any articles of clothing).

There's no excuse for charging people money for a copy of this film. It should be, at most, free for anyone who decides they want to see it. Unless you have a large collection of the worst films anyone has ever seen, and you are hoping to add to that collection, I highly suggest avoiding this nonsense at all costs. People making incompetent junk like this are flooding the market with their amateur crap, and its disgusting that they'd try to actually take someone else's money for a copy of it.

Be warned!",1249603200,7,2201,4.7637795275590555
