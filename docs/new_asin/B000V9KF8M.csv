8217437,5,B000V9KF8M,"This Movie was Donna Mills first role after leaving Knots Landing. I thought it was a good movie. But as a ""Knots"" fan I hated to see her leave the show. It's been years ago. But I'm happy to see that they released this movie on DVD. Worth buying. I wish Donna Mills would do more movies. I haven't seen her in anything in years. LOL",1458345600,,333,4.0606060606060606

8217439,4,B000V9KF8M,"This movie is good, but somewhat predictable.  There's no closed captioning and the dialogue is sometimes difficult to understand.  It's supposed to be a thriller, but you catch on quickly.  The ending is a surprise.",1386979200,,216,5.114285714285714
8217440,4,B000V9KF8M,This movie is a nice mystery romance flick. I saw this years ago and wonder if they had it on DVD and once i saw that they did i ordered it fast. Love Greg Evigan and Donna Mills,1363305600,,178,3.710526315789474
8217441,3,B000V9KF8M,"This is a thriller which is somehow in the Hitchcock mold. The technical quality is beyond reproach. Fans of Donna Mills will lap it up, she is in almost every scene and changes her hair several times. The story is not really original (memory loss, past time that is unaccounted, a double existence and a crime), the final denouement is tedious. Interesting detail (if you're interested in such trivia): The main character, Mills that is, does not drive a car and usually travels around with means of public transport.",1204416000,5,518,4.831460674157303
