581031,4,6303162290,"Overall this is a no-frills video with standard exercises. The instructors demonstrate good form.  A minor complaint is the music is redundant/annoying.

warmup+cooldown:  3 + 4 min (I skip doing these)

ARMS: This 10min.  1 or 2 sets of about 10reps each of delt flies (side & front), military press, lat flies, bicep curls, tricep extension, pec flies, push ups).  For beginners the routine is adequate as is.  For intermediate users, even using more weight might not be enough (I didn't break a sweat), unless you are doing super heavy weights or rewind-REPEAT the arm second (i.e. do it again as a second rep).  I would have liked an extra lat exercise to make this large muscle group work.

ABS:  This is 12min of variations of standard crunches, very intense and effective, I was surpised that I felt as sore as I did.",1160697600,2,824,4.699300699300699

581215,4,6303162290,"Very enjoyable silly movie!

It's a bit weak on the ""spy"" aspects, but it is great ""fluff"" to just sit back and enjoy.  Rumor seems to imply there will be a sequel / second movie ""Barely Lethal 2"" but I can't find any trace of it.

Hailee Steinfeld is a thoroughly enjoyable actress, she does a fine job in a movie where it would be really hard to shine.",1501027200,,354,4.101449275362318

581217,5,6303162290,"I'm a huge fan of fun ""YA"" movies, and this one didn't disappoint. It was just as good as a lot of the adult action flicks out there, but no sex and drugs and other time wasters in a film...there's other media out there if that's what you're looking for, don't fill up my two hours or less with something usually not very credible and thrown in to lengthen the movie or draw in pervs.

Jackson and Alba were wonderful and the lead kids were believable as teens...now I believe one of the girls is on Game of Thrones, so if you liked Censa or whatever the sassy daughter's name was, this is a nice change for that actress.

The movie goes along one of those cookie-cutter formulas, but also some good fight scenes and some unexpected moments. Reminiscent of 10 Things I Hate About You, Can't Hardly Wait, and that Freddie Prinze Jr. movie with the Josie and the Pussycats actress.",1499990400,,879,4.419753086419753

Nothing special but fun and dumb. One liners were actually pretty decent. The puns are strong in this one. I was hoping it was based on  book because a book would've been good. They would've had more time to flesh everything out, build characters, etc. Alas it's one of the rare movies these days not based on a preexisting property.",1498780800,,490,4.6976744186046515

I do love how they point out the teen movie formulas while executing them flawlessly. If you enjoy silly teen movies then this is for you. Teen movies like this are to lift your sprites and make you laugh. This is not meant to be moving or thought provoking. It's just simple fun.,1496534400,,382,4.394366197183099

Excellent casting with all the right people playing the right roles.  I sympathized with every character and easy to understand.

581782,2,6303162290,"I watched this because, 1) I like most of the cast and 2) I have a guilty pleasure for stupid but enjoyable fluff. However, this movie isn't very compelling, meandering around for most of the run time and suffering from a lot of flat performances. It looks nice enough and is competently shot, but that's about it.

This is one of those films that goes on and on about how ""real life"" isn't like movies, even though this is a movie with a premise as ludicrous as an AWOL teenage spy attends high school because she fell in love with old films.

One thing that really bugged me, personally, was how the film pressed the fact that the protagonist was a ""real"" secret agent / assassin who corrected all the common misconceptions of her job, but then there were lines thrown in that totally undermined that idea. The most egregious was a lame throw-away joke that claims there's a website where a small boy can fill out an application to join the super-secret assassin school. What? Why? How? It breaks so many rules in this universe!

But I love Hailee Steinfield's dry sense of humor which is why we gave it a chance, and though she was awesome (as always), Dove Cameron came out of nowhere and stole the film. Her lines had to have been improvised, or she beautifully delivered them that way. My favorite scenes were hers. Lots of hilarious moments. And if you don't find the film cute or funny, at least there's lots of eye candy in the form of leather-toting Sophie Turner, voice-of-an-angel Toby Sebastian (both GoT alum), and of course, Jessica frickin' Alba (good lord, she's hot in this movie---this from a straight married woman's perspective).",1482624000,,703,4.818181818181818

I think Hailee Steinfeld did a great job as the lead, and it was just so interesting seeing Jessica Alba and Sophie Turner as straight up villains.

""Let me tell you about my first time. I was younger than you, it was with my babysitter she was sixty-five and very gentle.""

It's made with a Disney Channel feel, but with content I wouldn't want to expose children too. So it doesn't really fit any audience except pedophiles.",1473292800,,579,4.411214953271028

584749,4,6303162290,"I watched this video on Amazon Prime as a part of my Prime membership.  I chose to watch it because of Hailee Steinfeld, who plays the main character.  I enjoyed her character in Pitch Perfect 2 and have also listened to one of her songs lately, so I thought it would be interesting.

The plot itself was fairly cheesy, but that was to be expected.  I was looking for some sort of feel-good comedy type movie and this fit the bill perfectly.  Steinfeld perfectly portrayed her character who was going through a bit of a rebellious phase after being trained to be a teenage assassin.  She was strong, funny, fierce, and quirky, which seems to be something which she plays well.

Was it realistic? No.  Was it somewhat predictable? Yes.  But as a 24 year old woman, I can say that it still hits the spot for when you need something to cheer you up.",1469664000,,846,4.406451612903226

He was compared to Dumbledore but the kids sent to Hogwarts at least had their parents permission to get the education they were receiving. This was... abuse and blatant child endangerment... and downright CREEPY when you actually thought about it.

It's like they were shooting for a 21 Jump Street (TV edition) and it could have been that... it had all the right stars (some of my favorites, even) but the ""ew"" factor of them actually BEING kids resulted in me just wanting to take a long, scalding shower. Ick.",1467936000,,736,4.88

It plays a bit like a Disney channel movie, with corny lines and lots of predictable teen drama.  But it's also rather self-aware, with some send-ups of teen movie tropes and a look at both being a teenager and parenting a teenager than manages to poke fun at the characters and be sympathetic to them at the same time.  Hailee Steinfeld is great as Megan/Agent 83, Dove Cameron is surprisingly fantastic as Megan's sarcastic exchange sister/frienemy, and Samuel L. Jackson is clearly having a grand time chewing scenery and being the amoral foster father/head spy you wish you had.

586141,2,6303162290,Good cast. Aimed at young teens. Thought would be good to watch with young teen daughter and her friend. Very mature themes such as sexual intercourse discussed by teen characters and suggestive crudeness. One use of the F Bomb also. Could have been a great movie for target audience but definitely not appropriate undertones for young impressionable teens.,1465430400,,357,5.172413793103448

586147,5,6303162290,"Wonderfully entertaining.  To see the spoof of small little girls being trained as assassins and one of them running away to live a ""normal"" life when she becomes a teen was very funny to me.  She read magazines as to how to act and dress with her only mistake being that the magazines were over 10-years' old.

Between doing everything wrong to fit in and hiding from other assassin's, the main character was lovable and adorable.  Definitely a feel-good movie with an interesting concept and a lot of laughs.",1465257600,,510,4.696629213483146

It isn't groundbreaking film by any means, but it entertained me and I enjoyed watching it. The plot was very predicable, but if you're just looking for a fun, light hearted film, I think this is right up your alley. Sometimes you just want to be entertained and kind of relive what it was like to be a little younger, I don't think there is anything wrong with that. I think the the main character is very likable and the plot line is easy to follow. In short, this is about a young girl who is has been part of a government agency that trains young kids to be soldiers/ assassins at a young age and she excels with doing so, but realizes one day that she is missing out on what is means/ feels to be a teenager. Mission goes wrong, she ""disappears"" and tries to live life like a normal high schooler. Of course you can't get out of a program as such that easily without consequences, and you see where this film is going. There is also a love triangle, some girl drama, etc. Everything you would expect from a movie as such. I would recommend it to anyone looking for just a chill, fun night, looking to be easily entertained.",1459382400,6,1236,4.241525423728813

Megan is a young teenage girl who has been trained as an assassin by a secret special ops agency her whole life, one day a mission goes slightly wrong leaving her with an opportunity to get out, she now thinks she can start a normal life and go to high school but she was wrong, her past comes back to get her and the new friends and family she has become so attached to.

This is a very cool and original take on the whole secret agent type of assassin movies out there, Megan Walsh (Hailee Steinfeld) is a teenage girl who is a bit of a Hit-girl when it comes to kicking ass, she finds a new family and friends forgetting the number 1 rule she was taught, No Attachment's! The movie is well paced with a great story that is full of great characters and genuinely funny humour, it takes your classic high school movies like Mean girls and bring it on etc and mixes it with spy movie ideas and comes up with a likeable cocktail of both genres, the cast is very good, Samuel L Jackson plays the head of the organisation that trained Megan, he gets a decent amount of screen time and plays your usual badass leader, Jessica Alba plays Knox the main villain, she's a sexy assassin that gets little but good looking screen time, Hailee Steinfeld is a brilliant young actress and makes a cool lead, Dove Cameron, Sophie Turner are amazing young actresses too, the movie like I said has a great level of comedy blended in that's really funny when you least expect it, the movie is feel good all round and so much fun, maybe a tad predictable but with a great story and lovable characters is a true gem and worth checking out!!

I loved the way it simultaneously goofed on and paid homage to the teen movies of the last 30 years. Lots of great acting even and not an awfully written story at all. I'm so glad that the movie didn't force any one of the characters into a stereotypical character-type like we are so used to seeing nowadays. The only negative thing I can complain about are the bizarrely utilized curse words and inappropriate topics in a movie that had a very ""clean"" feeling otherwise.

One teen, feeling deprived of a normal high school life, fakes her death to run off and be an exchange student.  Cute premise, but totally unrealistic, the plot was predictable and shallow and both the stunts and the acting were pretty terrible. I wanted to like the characters, and the main character's monologues were cute at times. But the ending was just dumb, as if a bunch of teens would fly away in a helicopter or a mom would be happy with her house full of bullets and broken glass.  Ugggh.

589776,3,6303162290,"This is in part a farcical takeoff on the kind of teen movie that pits a good, wholesome girl perhaps from the wrong side of the tracks against a clique of socially snobby girls. I have in mind films such as Mean Girls (2004), Pretty in Pink (1986) and Cruel Intentions (1999). Here the premise (shes an orphan trained since childhood to be an international assassin) is more than a bit ridiculous but has the virtue of serving up a heroine as fashionable as TVs Super Girl and Jennifer Lawrences Katniss Everdeen.

Hailee Steinfeld plays the awkward girl trying to have a normal high school life as an exchange student. Shes sweet, honorable, emotionally vulnerable and has little idea about how a teenaged American girl should act. However, thanks to her training she is tougher than the biggest dude on campus, which might come in handy.

I only want to say one more thing about this surprisingly fun movie: you know the formula: the good girl overcomes the mean girls, rejects the bad boy, and finds the perfect boyfriend (who is not all that popular but is also good and true) and lives happily ever after while the audience lives vicariously in triumph over their own high school demons. Or not. See this pleasant diversion and find out.

I truly loved the idea and the story line, that a teen was raised by a secret organization that trained her to be an assassin, and she fakes her death so she can see what it is like to be a real teen. However, I can not let my own teens watch this because of the language and innuendoes. It may be what being a real teen is all about, but I hate the language. Why can't movies be produced without the bad words?  Very frustrating and disappointing.

590740,1,6303162290,"Its well documented that the Hitler Youth program was a bad idea, and created permanent emotional harm to a great number of innocent children. In Barely Lethal it is taken to a whole new level. Here we have the government kidnapping and/or raising babies in secret fortresses for the purpose of brainwashing the children to be killers. And this I got simply from the cartoon during the opening credits. So its not like the main character of this movie is just a girl who has an overprotective bodyguard father.

I was a big fan of The Pretender Series which had a similar concept to this movie. However the pretender was written for adult viewers. Barely Lethal on the other hand passes itself off as fun loving, feel good, girl empowerment movie.

Normally I can enjoy a good girl empowerment movie, even when that girl is doing lots of hard hitting, shooting, action stuff. I don't mind that in reality these kids probably don't even know which end of the gun goes bang. I can appreciate these types of movies as getting out a message that girls can benefit from learning. But THIS movie is of a different ilk.  I am soo disgusted by what this movie is saying, and I am disgusted again, that its targeting an audience of youth and making everything end happily ever after. Sorry folks, I could only endure 8 minutes of it.

590894,4,6303162290,"Orphan 'Megan Walsh' (Hailee Steinfeld) has with other Orphans only known of a strict-regime of training as a Special-Ops
agent, something she becomes pretty effective as, however she craves to experience that which other 'teens' do in the
outside World......a World she has little understanding of.
Whilst on a mission to capture her Nemesis 'Valerie' (Jessica Alba) she fakes her own death to become an exchange student
and for the first time finding out what it's like to live life in a family orianted enviroment (well, almost normal) she moves in
the 'Larson's' - 'Mrs Larson' (Rachael Harris) teen 'Liz' (Dove Cameron) and young 'Parker' (Jason Ian Drucker) and subsequently
attends the local High-School ....a dream come true ?
'Megan' initially struggles to fit in and doesn't find what she believed to be normal that easy.....
Back at Op's her Senior Officer 'Hardman' (Samuel L Jackson) never believed number '83' (Megan) had actually died on the earlier
mission and wants er back in the fold.....however she convinces him to let her continue with her new life to see where it goes for
her.
Back at High-School 'Megan' finds that 'number '84' 'Heather' (Sophie Turner/ Game of Thrones) has been placed under-cover and
will prove troublesome.
'Hardman' after losing some of his agents could really do with his best student back in Special-Op's ...Agent '83' will soon undrstand why as she too becomes a target leaving her to fight for her survival.
In many ways this does have the feel of a teeny-movie, though it does have some good action sequences along the way along with a
good measure of humour.
An okay (fun-film) worth a spin if only as perhaps a catch-up on a movie-channel sometime.

591216,4,6303162290,"If you're looking for something light to watch on a Friday night, ""Barely Lethal"" might just fit the bill.
It did for me despite the fact the premise is not even remotely realistic, the plot is predictable and it's geared to a young teen audience. That said, the cast, led by Hailee Steinfeld and featuring both Samuel L. Jackson and Jessica Alba, does the most with what it has to work with and the result is a charming little coming-of-age movie with appealing characters.
The movie centers around a young orphaned girl (Steinfeld) who, trained from an early age to be a covert operative, simply wants to live as a normal teenager who goes to high school, has a boyfriend and a family. When a mission to capture a notorious arms dealer (Alba) doesn't go quite as planned she seizes the opportunity to escape into what she thinks is a normal life by playing dead. She winds up in a small town posing as an exchange student from Canada and discovers that high school, with its cliques and casual emotional cruelty, is far different from what she imagined and might just be worse than being a spy/assassin. She unwittingly exposes her host family to danger when the arms dealer she helped to capture on her last mission escapes from custody and begins looking for her to exact revenge.
Steinfeld, who was nominated for an Oscar for her performance as Mattie Ross in the remake of ""True Grit,"" handles the lead role with a nice blend of angst and innocence. Alba and Jackson have relatively little screen time in the film but make the most of their limited roles.
If you're looking for something ""deep"" this is not the film for you but if you just want to be entertained for a bit then grab some chips and dip and head for the couch, sit back and enjoy this cute movie.",1445299200,,1767,4.525

591840,1,6303162290,WHY?,1443830400,,4,4.0
591841,5,6303162290,"Barely Lethal starts off as a sort of Kingsman's Secret Service type film where this time round we've got a secret James Bond type training camp for girls who have been raised by the school since they were young orphans. Their main handler is played by Samuel L Jackson.  Hailee Steinfeld (True Grit when younger) plays the organisation's top student who escapes death on her first assignment and also decides to escape the secret agent life at the same time to become a regular teen girl.  She creates a secret identity as a Canadian exchange student, lives with a host mother (Rachael Harris, Suits, Diary of Wimpy Kid) as well as her kids and starts high school for the first time.  She has researched what this will be like from many 90's school films like Mean Girls, Bring it On, Clueless and thinks she'll blend right in. She's of course completely wrong, with only a nerdy fella wanting to get to her know her as she's the joke of the school to everyone else.

This obviously isn't a realistic film, but it is a lot of fun.  The most obvious unrealistic element is that you'd think passing for a regular teen and being able to quickly make friends of complete stranger teen girls so she could blend in when on assignment, would be pretty much the most important part of her training. Although she looked a lot older than the other spy school and high school girls, being I've never seen her in anything else, I also found in interesting to see Sophie Turner playing a character with a backbone, that was so unlike Sansa Stark in Game of Thrones.",1443830400,,1553,4.5321428571428575

592151,3,6303162290,"The pacing of this movie is a little jerky, the plot has holes large enough to fly a C130 transport through with room to turn around, and most of the supporting characters (including Alba's villain Knox) are somewhat one-dimensional. It feels as though the cast and crew are trying to shoehorn two movies in the playing time of one -- attempting to fit a spy thriller in at the same time as a teen rom-com, rather than a successful hybrid of the two. I had high hopes for this movie when I first saw the trailer, and while I was entertained to an extent, I am also disappointed at missed opportunities... I feel like if they had taken the time to make a full two-hour feature film, they might have been able to fit all the character development they needed to flesh them out better. That being said, Hailee Steinfeld did an admirable job with some very silly material, and Rachel Harris had some genuinely funny moments. I have to believe that a spy program that uses teenage children as assassins would at least prepare them for the real world, where they would have to blend in to position themselves in the field; no spy should ever be awkward, or they'll stick out in a crowd.

Although I cannot say you should miss important life events in order to see this movie, it's still a mostly enjoyable way to shut off your brain and indulge in fluffy nonsense. It is nowhere near the worst movie I've ever seen, but could have been much better, if only given the chance.",1443312000,,1468,4.4572490706319705

A child assassin leaves her trainer and hides out in a high school and experiences for the first time the challenges of adolescence.

She is great actress, a beautiful young girl with a great career ahead of her.  Barely Lethal shows her adaptation for comedy, we've already seen her dramatic performances in True Grit and others and now you can ad future potential super hero or spy film (Mission Impossible style).  It was a very enjoyable, funny, and her chemistry with Dove Cameron (who was also great in the film) and the incredible Samuel L. Jackson was perfect.  This was her stepping stone to her comedic performance in ""Pitch Perfect 2"" where she not only showed that she can continue her on screen comedy but introduced some of us to the fact that she can sing too.

I would recommend this to those who are looking for something light hearted and Disney-esque.  The only thing that goes against it is the fact that there is somewhat adult humor scattered throughout. It may not be whole-ly appropriate for really young kids. Otherwise, this movie has decent acting. It also has superstars like Samuel L Jackson and big names like Jessica Alba in it.  The storyline is pretty basic. A new girl tries to fit in at a school, where she doesn't quite belong. She learns what is important and deals with relationships. The 'twist' is that she is a trained assassin. The movie is more like a comedy than is dark like Nikita. If you don't mind cheesiness than this one is good for a rainy day or late night.",1441584000,,815,4.486486486486487

I will not, remembering that movies are primarily for entertainment. I decided to just enjoy this movie I had never even heard of before, along with my 2 little nephews and little niece. I found myself laughing alongside them and applauding the courage the filmmakers had to tackle a teen movie when just every silly teen plot has been redone and recycled many times.

Good acting by Hailee Steinfeld (the little girl in True Grit, now grown up) and others playing students in the high school - one nice thing, they look the right age to be in high school, unlike in some high school movies where the ""kids"" all look 30 years old.

I enjoyed this movie for the main plot, and big fun actors (Jessica Alba! Samuel L.! Sansa Stark! Whatever her real name is) but it took extra effort to suspend my disbelief. Mostly due to the terrible soundtrack, completely redundant narration, low budget acting from the lesser names, and obvious plot twists.

But still, I went in with low expectations so I was able to appreciate it a bit more for it's redeeming qualities. Aside from the bigger names, there were a decent amount of funny scenes and quotes, some cool action sequences (everyone loves a chick fight and Sansa's got some moves...and legs. Which is another virtue: hot women doing their thing!), parody of the genres, and just an overall light hearted-ness.

I watched this tonight on a whim. It turned out to be a fun little high school flick. It's along the lines of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. In fact it's very much like Buffy (the movie, not the show) A high school girl is a weapon of extreme power, and has to balance normal teenage stuff against her lethal training and stop the bad guys from doing bad guy stuff. Everything comes to a head at the school dance. So it's pretty much exactly like Buffy, except the bad guys are secret agents instead of vampires. (Gold star to the film makers for making a teenage movie WITHOUT vampires! Well done, and thank you!)

The Oscars aren't going to be calling on this one, but it's a fun little movie none the less.

Samuel L. Jackson is really funny in this. He manages to put his normal abrasive personality into a role that requires him to be nurturing towards children. The results of that mix are hilarious. And he pulls it off well.

It's a predictable story. But it's fun.",1439856000,,992,4.345945945945946

597710,2,6303162290,"Originally I was wondering why a movie with Samuel L. Jackson and Jessica Alba would end up in a straight to stream release. Surely with all that star power, they could expect to recoup some of the budget with a light marketing campaign for their nation wide theater release if they didn't want to invest in the film further. Then, about 20 minutes into the movie I understood why they cut their losses. I'm all for suspension of reality when it comes to movies that make things go boom but I just couldn't with this one. Jackson, Alba, Steinfeld and even Sophie Turner have done amazing work elsewhere and while I'm unsure why there was a such a disconnect in this project. There was plenty of poor acting, directing and it seems like a (purposefully cheesy) script was handled by a production team who just didn't know what they were doing, there is blame to share by everyone. The only reason I didn't give it a one star rating is because Sam Jackson is hilarious when he is barking orders at the tiny adorable girls trying to defuse bombs and to stab teddy bears.

It does at least depict teens making decent decisions about how to behave (sometimes after making poor decisions first).

598705,3,6303162290,"While bored and searching for a movie to watch I stumbled upon Barely Lethal.  It attracted me with its cast, which includes Oscar-winner Hailee Steinfeld, Sophie Turner, and Samuel L. Jackson.  I was hoping for a hidden gem, which I didn't find, but it did relieve my boredom for an hour and a half.

Steinfeld plays 83, an orphan raised to be an assassin.  However, she'd much rather be an ordinary girl.  When she gets a chance, she fakes her death and then attends high school as an exchange student from Canada.

There are good moments in Barely Lethal.  There's a running joke about Ke$ha perfume that just gets funnier and more absurd as it goes on.  I don't know if it was paid product placement, but it worked.  Steve-O makes a hilarious cameo as a torturer who really gets 83, now going by the name Megan Walsh.  And Megan's host family has great chemistry with her.  I was only familiar with Dove Cameron, who plays the daughter, from an ice-cream video song one of my younger cousins made me watch.  But she does a good job building up a sisterly rapport.

Unfortunately, there's lots of clunky moments.  83 gets most of her knowledge from nineties teen films, plus Mean Girls.  She seems not to notice that Mean Girls updated a lot of the tropes she follows.  She also is shown reading up to date magazines, but seems to take fashion inspiration from the parts of the eighties that aren't currently in style.  Also, everyone makes fun of her makeup from her terrible first day of school appearance when the problem is her hair and outfit.  It seems like a top spy would be better at researching and blending in.  I was up for some lampooning of teen movie tropes, but Barely Lethal was just so awkward about it.

I like Sophie Turner on Game of Thrones, but she seemed rather stiff as 84, who has a one-sided rivalry with 83.  Her character is supposed to be icy, but just felt a little off.  Maybe it was the American accent they made her do.  Jessica Alba's villain is thinly written, but I did appreciate that a former teen actress was cast for the role.  It was a nice meta joke.  (I liked the casting over all, which mostly has actual teens playing teens.  Some of the guys were older.)

599572,3,6303162290,"Barely Lethal is a comedy about high schooler Megan (Hailee Seinfeld) who was raised in a secret spy program to be a secret agent/assassin. But Megan yearns for a normal adolescence and, on a mission, decides to fake her own death and assume a false identity as an exchange student. Megan assumes that high school is just as its portrayed in the movies and on TV. Once enrolled in school, however, she sees that being a normal teenager in high school has its downside of catty peers, petty rivalries, and romantic intrigue.

The comic theme, of course, is that high school is more brutal than being an assassin. The movie channels other pictures, particularly Mean Girls, Heathers and Cruel Intentions, though the tone in Barely Lethal is lighter and more sitcom-y. Unfortunately, after a promising if unlikely premise, it soon settles into overly familiar territory. Jessica Alba, Samuel L. Jackson, Thomas Mann, and Sophie Turner co-star.

Bonus extras on the Blu-ray release include  the featurette, Back to School: On the Set of Barely Lethal; deleted scenes; and audio commentary with director Kyle Newman and actors Dove Cameron and Thomas Mann. A digital HD copy is enclosed.",1438992000,,1182,5.020408163265306

The basic plot of the movie centers on a teenage girl raised at Prescott a covert school to raise and train spies/assassins.  The backstory is quickly dispensed with by the opening credits and a voiceover at the start of the movie.  Agent 83, the protagonist, is the top scoring student at Prescott and she is sent on a ""capture/extraction"" of the films bad guy played by Jessica Alba.  Things don't go as planned and Agent 83 is thought to be killed in action.  Agent 83 then uses her ""death"" to take the opportunity to be a normal teenager and go to high school, which she has researched by watching ""Mean Girls"" and other movies.  I won't give up any more plot points but there are some clever scenes which increased my rating from a 3 to a 4/5 rating.

600728,2,6303162290,"Although this is a comedy, I still expected some aspect of realism, which is sadly lacking here.  The main character does not come across as a girl trained since birth to be an assassin, but more like your average boy obsessed teenage girl.  I'm assuming this is not a children's movie given the rating and the adult humor, but the movie feels like its made for children.  Even Samuel Jackson couldn't elevate this film to a more adult like tone.  At least the supporting actress, Sophie Turner, conveyed a sense of seriousness you'd expect in a girl hardened through years of training, but then again she is the antagonist in this movie, and in my opinion, a better actress than Hailee Steinfeld.  There's nothing wrong with making a movie about a teenage assassin girl who is curious about high school and/or boys.  That's actually an interesting theme for a comedy; the humor in this movie does in fact work most of the time, but if you're going to go that angle then you should at least make the girl believable as an assassin, otherwise you don't have a comedy about an assassin girl, but a movie that focuses on an obnoxious, brooding high school girl.
If you want to see a better movie with a similar theme, though it is definitely not a comedy, watch the Korean drama ""Killer Girl K.,"" which is a kind of teenage ""La Femme Nikita"" and truly as great.  It is extremely violent and brutally realistic, but the story is like ""Barely Lethal"" -  about a teenage assassin girl who fakes her own death and attends high school, though her classmates are unaware of what she is.  Saoirse Ronan in ""Hanna"" was also quite good in a similar role.  And in the TV series ""Agent Carter"" there is an episode about the Russian Black Widow program that depicts what real teenage assassin girl training is like and is actually sad to watch.  Far cry from ""Barely Lethal's"" depiction.",1438732800,2,1872,4.591591591591592

It started out on okay footing: a mash-up of secret agent movie and high school movie. At first it seemed like it was going to be subversive, breaking down a stereotypical high school movie and turning it on its head. And then in the final act of  the movie it suddenly became a stereotypical high school movie. The bad ass secret agent heroine was more concerned with going to homecoming and boys than with the fact that an evil psychopath wanted her dead. The major fight between the two rival female characters wasn't about a mission or saving the world, it was about old grudges and a boy. And in the end, the main character doesn't even save the day, she's rescued by a little boy and her father figure. It was so stupid. If you're going to have a movie about a highly skilled undercover operative, I expect that operative to be an active part in the resolution of the plot regardless of their gender. I got to the end of the movie and wondered, what was the point of even having her be a spy, she could have just been a regular high school girl and it wouldn't have made that big a difference.

That said, the secondary characters were fabulous. They were funny and fairly well-developed. They stole all the scenes they were in.",1438300800,2,1366,4.416666666666667

Indeed, Barely Lethal is the perfect Satuday afternoon flick. The script could use some polish (the way Steinfeld's character vacillates between knowing nothing of pop culture and being near-omniscient is a little abrupt) and much of the CGI looks distinctly low-budget, but the actors seem to be having fun (even Jackson, who can be notorious for phoning it in on projects like this) and the whole thing goes down smoothly with no unpleasant aftertaste. The only way I would have enjoyed the movie more would be if I discovered it on a snow day.

Don't expect the world, don't look for an undiscovered gem; just enjoy a move that in 1987 or so would have played at the multiplex for about four weeks and made about $60 million dollars.",1438214400,,964,4.631578947368421

Take this phrase for an example: ""sketchier than a 2:00am Waffle House.""

This is a quote. An actual quote taken directly from this movie.

What is that even supposed to mean? Did the writer(s) even stop to think that hey, maybe this phrase - as we have worded it - just doesn't make sense? Along with many other bits of dialogue that are intended to be clever but fall incredibly short of that mark. Was it completely impossible to just look back through the script and fix some of these? It wouldn't have been that difficult to just rephrase this to ""sketchier than a Waffle House at 2:00am."" The intended joke is still there. It just makes more sense.

Seriously, though, if the writers of this film ever read this: Next time, hire an editor.

Then, it starts getting good...before falling flat...and ending up with a predictable cheesy end. If you are bored, its worth it.

Yes, it was cheesy, not to mention dumb, predictable, and the storyline was preposterous, but even despite all that I couldn't stop myself from cracking up at Meagans (Hailee Steinfeld) antics of trying to leave a life of a spy to become a normal teenage girl.

The cast was good. I had no complains about it, my only concern was that you can tell Sophie Turner was having a tough time keeping her American accent. When she spoke it sounded forced. I get shes not use to speaking in an American accent, nevertheless I would have preferred if she kept her English accent in the movie, I would have taken her character more seriously.

There was one cast member who surprisingly won me over and I hope to see her more in the future. I didn't expect much of Dove Cameron. To tell you the truth when I found out she was in the movie I expected the worst. Why? Well, I don't know why, I just know that the first thing that popped into my mind was not another Disney star!

602388,5,6303162290,"Oscar nominated Hailee Steinfeld and a top rated cast, does a excellent job in making this spy/teen comedy fun and enjoyable. Hailee plays agent 83,a spy who happens to be a 16 year old kid who wants to just be a normal teenager. She figures a way to do this but finds both her secret agent life and highschool dream complicating her life even more than she wanted. Hailee's comedic acting is natural and  flows well. Everyone involved gives great performances that brings out the best in this film.
There are PG13, adult type jokes in this movie, so be careful if you have younger children in your family. Other than that, Hailee proves that she is worthy of her Oscar nomination by making her action character lovable,as well as believable in her reactions. Her acting skills is first rate...and yes she is barely 18...she really finishes homeschool and gets her high school diploma this year. Add to that she has another movie ,Pitch perfect 2 the # 1 movie this month, as well as the number one movie soundtrack where she actually sings!!!  Plus she is also in Taylor Swift's new music video...a good friend of hers..  Hailee has had a great career so far since True Grit!!!",1433030400,30,1178,4.626794258373206
602389,2,6303162290,"First, it's pushing the PG13 limits. Probably for the teen 15 and over. It's also very predictable. The movie was 60 minutes of entertainment but unfortunately it was much longer .",1432944000,,180,4.838709677419355
602390,5,6303162290,This was a great family movie.  We popped 4 bags of popcorn (five of us) and sat back and enjoyed the show.

602393,4,6303162290,"Meagan (Hailee Steinfeld) is an orphan raised and trained by Hardman (Samuel L Jackson- no eye patch) to be an assassin. While on an assignment, Meagan grabs an opportunity to free herself from the group and become a normal high school student. Unfortunately for Meagan she has learned all she knows about High School from watching ""Mean Girls"" and ""90210."" She quickly doesn't fit in. She stumbles through High School until her past catches up with her.

The premise is great. I was expecting a cross between ""Mean Girls,"" ""So Undercover"" and ""The Pacifier."" In a way it was, but wasn't well executed. The film could have been better. Hailee Steinfeld was not convincing in her role as a killer or High School student, which was ashamed since she had a great supporting cast. A movie you can like but not love.

Guide: 1 F bomb. No sex or nudity. 3 1/2 stars",1432857600,,859,4.607843137254902
602394,2,6303162290,"Hailee Steinfeld plays Megan Walsh, a young woman who was trained to be an assassin from early childhood by a secret organization that seems quite a bit more insidious than the film makes it out to be.  Samuel L Jackson plays her trainer and handler.  Megan's whole life is training and operations, both of which she excels at, but after secretly (and guiltily) watching a bunch of teen movies like Breakfast Club and Mean Girls trained-to-kill Megan decides that what she really wants is chance at a normal life--at least for a little while--so she fakes her death during a mission, enrolls as an exchange student so she can stay with a normal family (something she never had) and goes to high school, with her entire knowledge of non-assassin life consisting of what she saw in the various movies.

Barely Lethal doesn't lack for an original concept or talented cast but the whole thing feels cheap and lazy--the action scenes are barely functional and the comedy very rarely funny.  Having Megan approach real life based on what she learned watching teen movies is a cute idea but the movie gets very little comic mileage out of it.  Barely Lethal is a fish out of water comedy about a girl who wants to be normal but doesn't really know how and also an action comedy featuring a villain (Jessica Alba) who wants to track down and kill Megan for reasons that are never actually explained--apparently Jessica Alba's Victoria Knox wants to kill Megan simply because Victoria is the villain and that's what villains do but a little bit of motivation would have been nice, particularly when it's revealed that Victoria was a product of the same secret academy that spawned Megan.

The family Megan is staying with doesn't yield much in the way of laughs either--there's a running gag about the little brother who wants to be a ninja finding various spy gear in Megan's room that never really goes anywhere.  Then there's the teen sister.  Dove Cameron plays Liz Larson, the normal teen Megan is living and going to school with whom you would think she is supposed to learn being normal from.  The weird thing is that Liz is supposed to be socially isolated and unpopular which I didn't realize until more than halfway into the movie because she looks like a super-model.  There's no attempt to give her bad hair or glasses or ugly clothes or anything so I assumed that Liz was a popular girl who was embarrassed to be seen with the socially awkward Megan when actually assassin girl is supposed to be the one bringing Liz out of her shell.  When a light comedy is so underwritten that you can completely misread what's supposed to be going on for a large chunk of the running time that's definitely not a good thing.

Barely Lethal isn't very funny and the action scenes definitely don't bring to mind Hit Girl from Kick-Ass--the use of body doubles in the fight scenes is way too obvious and the action is staged with no imagination or energy.  Still, Hailee Steinfeld manages to be very likable even though the script mostly lets her down and Samuel L Jackson gets most of the film's rare laughs in his interactions with children, the younger the better.  Barely Lethal is easy to sit through but in the end that's about the best that can be said for it.",1432857600,2,3255,4.648083623693379
