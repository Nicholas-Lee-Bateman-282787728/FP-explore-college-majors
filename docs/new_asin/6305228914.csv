7885980,5,6305228914,This exercist is my favorite movie of all time. Since I'm from Missouri this shows how the boy came to St. Louis and we can even go to the places where it all happened. I love the behind the scenes story and definitly recomment it.,1438732800,,231,4.155555555555556

7885982,4,6305228914,"I have the VHS and most of the facts are correct, as far as I can tell.  It isn't supposed to be a ""sensationalized"" effort.  In fact, from all I have seen of the video, it's presented in a very matter-of-fact way.

They're not looking to make ""believers"" out of people, but present what happened along with a critique from both sides of the issue.

Granted, I wouldn't be watching this for the same purpose as I would the Exorcist.  The Exorcist was meant to scare the bejeezers out of you, and this seems to be designed to inform.  All in all, well worth the money they charge.",1099094400,6,579,4.314814814814815
7885983,2,6305228914,"In The Grip Of Evil is an interesting little snippet of American occultism, but hardly an authoritative documentary on exorcism in the United States.  However, the DVD may lead the viewer to take a more in depth look at occultism.  If that's the case, I recommend Michael Cueno's book American Exorcism: Expelling Demons In The Land Of Plenty.",1036281600,2,343,4.896551724137931
7885984,5,6305228914,"I have all the exorcist Movies and this really does a great job of explaining all the beginning to end details.  If the Original movie of the 70's doesn't get you back to church, this documentary, sure will!!!!!",1015718400,3,211,4.552631578947368
7885985,4,6305228914,"It's not often you see a good documentary and then get access to the sources used to make it.  I was quite impressed with this DVD and the story.  It is much better done than your typical documentary fare.
To address the previous reviewer, I checked out the DVD of this documentary and I think they got it pretty much right.  The DVD includes the diary of the exorcist priest and letters and newspaper clippings that corroborate all the locations mentioned in the film.  If your basis for fact checking is the internet, I'm not at all surprised you think this film is wrong.  Check the real sources.",980294400,10,599,4.5092592592592595
7885986,5,6305228914,"This Documentary/Drama tells the true story behind the movie. It has interviews with a priest, who was a seminarian at the time, who was an eye witness to the rites. The film also interviews the director of the Exorcist as well as the author of the book by the same name. Actual portions of the diary are read. It does a real great job in supplying the background that was either ""Hollywoodized"" or left out of the movie. If you are a fan of the Exorcist, I would strongly encourage you to get this video! I found it did a very tastful and thorough job in explaining the story behind the movie.",970272000,,594,4.3125
