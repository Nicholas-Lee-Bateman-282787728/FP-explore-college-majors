2652753,3,B000I2J6ZK,"This movie is definitely not for everyone's taste.  But for those who are keen on viewing cult movies, it is an extremely good choice.  The director Kuei Chi-hung is noted for making cult movies, and The Boxer's Omen is one of his very best.  A little warning, better avoid viewing this movie while you are eating, otherwise you may throw up upon seeing certain scenes.",1309219200,,369,4.6461538461538465
2652754,1,B000I2J6ZK,"It pains me to ever give a Shaw Brothers film such a negative review but 1 star was all I could muster... even after reading all the other well-written reviews stating why I should be giving it at least 4.  This one truly suprised me.  It contains martial arts, horror, gore, and the always enjoyable Lung Wei Wang (THE Master Of The Flying Guillotine himself) and Bolo Yeung (needs no clarification!)... so what went wrong?  Probably the fact that everything I mentioned above is so poorly done or underutilized that your left with a mess of a movie and a look of dissapointment (or disbelief) on your face.  You get a little fighting here and a little horror there but mostly you get really bad set pieces and special effects that make most of the generic Italian exploitation films from the same era look like documentaries!  I don't know though?  Maybe I was expecting too much (or maybe I should have been drunk) because I seem to be the only reviewer who didn't enjoy this?  If you are looking for action, genuine chills, or even a movie to gross you out then this isn't the one... if you want something to watch with alcohol and friends this may be worth some laughs but even those won't last very long (try Bolo or Fearless Fighters instead for more enjoyment and near endless chuckles in those scenarios).",1190419200,4,1314,4.56595744680851
2652755,2,B000I2J6ZK,"First of all, I have seen more than my share of strange Japanese films. However, this is one of the weirdest, strangest, demented and oddest, [throw in any adjective that you like] films that I have seen. I thought the Japanese made some of the weirdest films around: And they do! but this one takes the cake. This Hong Kong film, by the Shaw Brothers, is one of the strangest I have ever viewed. Moreover, it is not for the weak of stomach. And if anything, it boasts some of the cheesiest special effects you are likely to view. Is this a great film? No! Is it a good film? Not really: Unless you are into extremely bizarre films. And after awhile viewing the film, you may not even care, as the film veers into so many strange areas that you wonder what in the heck you are watching. Also, don't expect too much from the special effects, as they are about some of the silliest you are likely to ever watch.

So what is the fascination with this film? Who knows. Some will like this film as it is a cult classic. For me, after sitting through the film I actually got to the point where I just wanted to see where the film was taking me. And it takes you everywhere. I could not figure out some of the Buddhist symbolism the film employs; but at some point I really stopped caring. Then there is the journey the film takes you on that really gets bizarre. With Buddhist monks fighting the forces of evil, the director takes the viewer on a really demented trip. The Shaw Brothers give the viewer one mind bending piece of cinema that goes everywhere and anywhere. Moreover, fans of weird films might like this excursion into dementia. For this is not a typical horror film, or martial arts film.

What starts out as a martial arts film, where a Thai boxer and Chinese boxer are fighting in a ring, then segues into a black magic film where everything goes. And I mean everything. As I was watching the film, I kept wondering what the script writer and director were thinking when they made this film. It never stops getting weird. And actually, weird is an understatement. This is a psychedelic mind trip that just keeps on getting stranger. The reviewer Morgoth has given a review of the film, and describes some of the strange parts of the film, however, he only scratches the surface. You have to see the film [or not] to believe it. Extreme caution is advised for those who wish to watch this film. It may be a cult classic, but it is very difficult to watch more than once. The film will not appeal to the vast majority of people, therefore, before buying, I advise that you rent it first.",1188000000,4,2595,4.392931392931393
2652756,4,B000I2J6ZK,"Excellent DVD of a great cult film. And don't worry about the language the previous review mentions. Considering the reviewer is from France, it's unlikely they've even seen this release to make a judgement on the quality of the disc, which is the best this film has ever seen in any form. No matter, by this time, Shaw Brothers Studios were dubbing and releasing their films in Cantonese and Mandarin in theaters at the same time. Considering there's at least three or more languages spoken in the film, the studio had their own dubbers, who usually were not the stars of the film anyway. So there's no ""correct"" soundtrack for this film, no matter what the ""experts"" will tell you. It won't affect you're enjoyment of the movie in any way.",1168473600,5,741,4.66412213740458
2652757,2,B000I2J6ZK,"""The Boxer's Omen"" has been released only in VCD in HK (by IVL). So I was hoping that the R1 release from Image Entertainment on DVD would be a good means of seing it in perfect conditions.

Unfortunately the soundtrack is not the original Cantonese but Mandarin...

2652758,4,B000I2J6ZK,"There are movies that are entertaining for no other reason than that you just can't believe what you're watching on the screen. The Boxer's Omen is a phantasmagoria of grossness, questionable special effects, gawdy visuals and Buddhism that is so exuberantly bizarre I couldn't wait to see what would happen next. Part of the movie is a kickboxing revenge story, which is the only part of The Boxer's Omen that isn't insane, but the rest of it deals with the wildly hallucinatory conflict between Buddhists and practitioners of the dark arts.

The special effects are audaciously bad at times, particularly those involving animals. I swear that the bats and spiders in one part looked like plush toys, or something similar. For any of you who have seen The Beyond and marvelled at how fake the spiders looked in that movie, the ones in The Boxer's Omen are even more ridiculous. The special effects in this movie would surely bring the quality down a notch if the overall style wasn't so over the top. There is so much fantastic absurdity to behold that it's difficult to be distracted by any one thing.

The black magic in this movie is the source for most of the grossness. Whenever one of the dark priests casts a spell, they usually chew up all sorts of nasty things and spit them out, somtimes repeatedly. There's also one part where they slice open an alligator, toss its guts out on the floor and then stuff a corpse inside in order to raise it from the dead. I just watched Jungle Holocaust where an alligator gets sliced open and has its innards strewn about, so I think I've had enough of that sort of thing for a while.

Because this movie exists almost entirely in the realm of the supernatural, it doesn't always make very much sense. The protagonists are Buddhists, so maybe possessing knowledge about the religion will put some of the occurences in this film into perspective. Otherwise, the viewer can only go along for the ride and throw reason to the wind. I guess it is best classified as fantasy/horror with a small amount of martial arts thrown in. There's also a little T&A, for those so inclined.

If you have a difficult time suspending disbelief or like movies that make sense, you probably shouldn't watch this. I'd also recommend avoiding it if you find rampant, garish blood and gore disagreeable. Otherwise, it's worth experiencing at least once for the mindboggling weirdness alone.",1166832000,9,2412,4.749403341288783
2652759,5,B000I2J6ZK,"This Shaw Bros Horror film simply must be seen to be believe. It's not a martial arts film, but there are a few fight scenes with Bolo. The movie showcases gruesome black magic duels instead of kung fu action. Fans of  surreal horror(The Beyond, The Viy, Evil Dead 2) will be pleased. There's all sorts of attacking spiders, monster bats, alligator monsters, flying heads and a demon woman. The effects will be laughable to some but the sheer crazed  enthusiasm of them won me over. There is also quite a bit of gore, slime and real creepy crawlies. An eel is puked up in one scene. The Image dvd looks great and comes with a booklet detailing the history of the film.",1166745600,13,668,4.467213114754099
8143663,4,B000I2J6ZK,"Over the top occult horror from the Shaw Brothers. Lots of grotesque imagery and fun action. If you are a fan of low budget horror and don't mind ""goopey"" and gross effects, it's a fun ride.",1478131200,,190,4.305555555555555
8143664,4,B000I2J6ZK,"Boxer's Omen is a movie where gross out Jackass style sketches, kung fu fights, religious track propaganda, random nudity, and magic fantasy battles all combine to create an amazing film. The basic plot is that a guy has to fight an evil wizard because he is spiritual twins with a monk. It's an issue cause it's getting in the way of him being a gangster and boxer but he does it anyway. Not making that up. The movie starts as a wilder version of Bloodsport complete with Bolo Yeung but suddenly turns into Harry Potter meets Alejandro Jodorwowsky's The Holy Mountain after 15 minutes. When people start eating gross things and spitting it into a bowl before someone else eats it too and spits it back into the same bowl for someone else to eat, you suddenly realize Jackass/Johnny Knoxville has gotten in there too. Not being a black magician, I can't attest how important the eating half eaten food from another person was to create an evil lady monster but this film will assure you that's exactly how you do it.

It's hard to say a lot about the movie without spoiling a ton. It's gross. You'll never see more maggots in your entire life unless you find some sort of mass grave. However, it's also one of a kind. A real cultural relic from a HK studio suffering a change of market and pulling out all the stops to get back on top. Well worth checking out for all that and more.",1476057600,3,1383,4.44488188976378
8143665,3,B000I2J6ZK,It gets a bit wrapped up in strange visuals which add little to story line. Weird visuals do not a strange movie make.,1465171200,,118,4.173913043478261

8143668,5,B000I2J6ZK,"After his brother is crippled in a Thai Boxing match with champion boxer Bu Bo (Bolo Yeung), Chan Hung (Phillip Ko Fei) starts getting visions of a monk who appears to him in his dreams and also helps get him out of a tight spot. Travelling to Thailand to track down Bo on a promise to his brother to get revenge, he is drawn to the temple that was the source of his visions and becomes involved in a battle of Bhuddism vs Black Magic due to a link to his past life.

There are the usual training scenes, but the battle scenes are something else. I am being deliberately vague as it is best that you see the movie yourself. I could tell you what happens but you wouldnt believe it or think I was exaggerating.

The director made a number of black magic and action films for Shaw Brothers, but this was the one where he got to go all out and it was one of his last films as a director. He also came up with the story, which does have elements that were based in reality such as the Abbott being preserved after death and being covered in gold leaf by his followers and the various locations used.

While there are people in this film, the real stars of the movie are the critters and the special effects. I know they are meant to be scary, but they come across as so over the top and theatrical that they become something more than the film. The first exposure to this movie for a lot of people came when group the Animal Collective mentioned the URL to the Youtube clip of the first battle scene in a magazine interview (since taken down) and it was the first part of the movie I saw also.

The black magic practitioners are meant to be the bad guys, but they don't seem to be so bad as you never see what they are trying to do. The monks have a rod up their arse sometimes, Phillip Ko gets his end wet once with his missus after the first battle and suddenly he has lost all his power. Cmon! Cant you give him special dispensation?

I did like the critters as they looked like they would be fun to hang out with if they were not trying to kill you. The bats are very floppy and plastic looking, the spiders are cute and drink through straws, the snapping crocodile skulls are a bit dumb, but like to play fetch with chicken guts, there is a big crocodile who is menacing, but gets stuck in small gaps. At one point the hero gets held down and menaced by fuzzy caterpillars who look like they are tickling him. He also gets a killer nipple cripple in one scene.

None too sure about the killing animals on screen though, they don't actually show the chickens head being cut off but you see a head drop. I am well aware it is part of the shock value of some of these movies to show live animal deaths just to get a reaction out of the audience. Most of the animals here are fake so its is not as big a thing.

I do not even know how they managed to get the actors to do some of the things in this movie, as in chew raw chicken guts, cut the arse off a chicken, chew it and throw it up, pass it on to the next person to chew on or lie naked under a swarm of maggots. If you just vomited in your mouth, then this is probably not the film for you.

There are a series of these sorts of movies form Hong Kong in the 1980s and they do seem interesting and something different from the normal kung fu, comedies or dramas that I have seen in the past. I will try to see more of these movies in the future as I enjoyed this one.

I would almost recommend this movie for kids if it wasn't for the nudity and some of the gorier scenes, it almost reminds me of the Japanese movie House in that it never seems to change its tone even with the scenes that are meant to be serious. It does have the same magical quality to it that makes it special and one that I would recommend to people who are burnt out on the usual fare and what something very different.",1428192000,,3844,4.074074074074074
8143669,5,B000I2J6ZK,Amazingly demented film for any fan of cult cinema,1421280000,,50,4.666666666666667
8143670,4,B000I2J6ZK,"What a concoction! This truly is one of the most bizarre freakfests of a movie I've ever seen. I found it very entertaining. It goes out of it's way to stir in every possible effect (from fantastic to fake, from dubious to dynamite) in it's supernatural tale of kickboxing, buddhist monks and black magic. It has EVERYTHING. Candy colors, evil sorcerers, black magic rituals, fighting, analog computer effects, demons, animation, lasers, nudity, gore (either cheesy and patently fake to grotesque and unsettling), puppetry, smoke screens, wonky sound effects, voices from the beyond and mysticism. It's a Jodorowsky movie for a B-movie audience. It's briskly paced, fun and funny, a unique hybrid of genres. I actually found the cheap, toy-like animal minions quite endearing. And just a note: They were consistent in the application: If there was a fake spider it was purposefully artificial from the get go. They didn't use a real spider than cut to a fake one - something that often happens in movies that actually underscores the absurdity of the effect. They consistently used these fake bats, spiders and rats which gave the film a kind of bizarre Puff n' Stuff delerium!",1396483200,,1177,5.041025641025641
8143671,2,B000I2J6ZK,"One of the Shaw Brothers excursions into horror, something they did a lot of in the mid 70s (IE: Black Magic 1 & 2, Corpsemania, The Seeding of a Ghost, Killer Snakes). There will be very little here for fans of Martial arts flicks, and probably more here for fans of B-movie horror. I happen to be a fan of both, so I went in thinking this would be a win-win situation. But alas, that was not to be the case.

I will not duplicate the other reviews on here with yet another regurgitation of the plot. Suffice it to say that The Boxers Omen may be valuable to martial arts film enthusiasts for two reasons. First, the films martial arts antagonist is none other than Bolo Yeung, and he does look in fine form during the films two kickboxing sequences. Second, this is a very rare Shaw Brothers film that, like much of the Shaw Bros library, hasn't been seen in the U.S. since the 70s. So let us thank God once again for the restorative efforts of Celestial Pictures.

I have no problem with the film being a kung fu/horror hybrid, but I didn't feel that the elements mixed as well in here as they did in, say, HUMAN LANTERNS for instance (See my review on here for THAT film). I thought the kickboxing sequences were decently done, and I did find the horror sequences very horrific, but of course many of the special FX were extremely cheezy and very fake-looking, even for B-movie fare. I also thought several of the sequences were just way over the top simply for the sake of being over the top, but there was no real reason for them other than gratuitous shock and gore. For example, why is it necessary to place a wrapped womans corpse inside of a gator/croc carcass and sew it up to assist in its metamorphosis from death to life? Why is it necessary to feed the corpse food that has been chewed and spat out by one, then two, then three priests? Why does the black sorcerer send something as inept as a severed, floating, reptilian head to combat the monk warrior? I should just quit trying to apply any kind of logic to this, shouldnt I?  I don't mind gratuitous horror gore of the EVIL DEAD and DRAG ME TO HELL variety, but I need a reason for the characters doing what they do.

So I did not enjoy this film, though I am always grateful for the chance to see any of Shaw Brothers rare gems. If you're looking for cheap B-Movie horror, you may well enjoy this film. Unfortunately, it was even too cheap and cheezy for me.",1390780800,2,2429,4.331868131868132
