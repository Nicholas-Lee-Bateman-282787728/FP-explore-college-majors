7891420,4,6305534470,"Canvas of Blood is a low-budget yet oddly compelling film.  If the acting weren't so bad, it could actually be considered something of a drama.  Its horror aspects don't really show up until the second half of the movie, and gore-hounds should know that what little gore is featured here is not very impressively done.  The story itself centers around a college professor and his talented violinist daughter.  The professor dreamed of a musical career himself, but a hand injury sustained some time during his two tours of duty in Vietnam made his dream an impossible one.  His daughter, though, is truly gifted and is sure to achieve the success he could only dream about.  Then poor daughter Julia develops a cyst in one of her hands, and a surgeon botches the operation, thereby doubling the number of one-handed victims in the family.  Herein is a lesson for us all: always get a second opinion when it comes to important medical decisions; you never know when the first doctor might be an incompetent, drug-using alcoholic.  With this type of tragedy taking place, you would think the father would be a little wary of trusting anyone, yet he immediately puts all of his trust in the first lawyer who comes knocking.  What follows is a travesty of justice wherein the whole legal system betrays the public trust in a mutually profitable cover-up.  The father is naturally quite upset, while Julia is all but comatose with grief over losing her career, her boyfriend, and, yes, even her dog.  The resulting murders aren't shown in any gory detail, which is good because what we do see looks rather inexpensively done, but the ending comes off rather well in a strange way.  The only problem is that the movie does not end at the ending.  In one of the most baffling, unexplainable, terribly ill-conceived decisions in film history, the makers of this movie chose to tag on almost five minutes of mindless antics featuring two disgusting men doing very weird things inside a nudie bar.  I urge you to stop the movie when this scene begins because watching it does a lot of damage to what is an otherwise reasonably good film.  Since this final scene is outrageously irrelevant, I am not factoring it in to my generous four-star rating of the movie.",1053734400,,2250,4.748071979434448

Her cheating boyfreind breaks  up with her, and she slips into a coma. The father hires a shady lawyer,  who gets a payoff from the doctor to lose the case. The judge is paid off  by the lawyer to make sure they lose. The father goes out for  revenge.
The film is cheaply done but worthwhile. The acting is awful,  but thats to be expected. It looked like it was shot on video, but filmed  rather well. The sound needed work, it was hard to hear at times. The music  was great. The gore effects are sanitized, so if gore is what you like you  may want to look elsewhere. I would call this film drama not horror.",949449600,,878,4.178571428571429
