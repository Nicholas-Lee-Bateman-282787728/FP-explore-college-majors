8247185,5,B0012Q3T3Q,"I bought this for my husband because he likes the reality-based types of series. It is well-documented and professionally done. Very enjoyable to watch and extremely inspiring. If you are a Christian with a desire to see people come to know Jesus Christ, you will find this series challenging and motivating, while also fulfilling the category of 'entertainment.'",1484438400,,363,5.275862068965517
8247186,5,B0012Q3T3Q,"First, let me just preface by saying I own every single DVD and episode of Travel the Road. This is a must see. What stood out the most to me in this season, they began their journey just by simply ""going"" . What stood out to me also as I am in the mission field regularly (averaging 38 mission trips a year) that you see God working mightily through two men whose only tool is the Bible. Christ Himself has given us everything we need to do His work - the Great Commission...the Bible. We always think we need this and that to be able to do or go..well for those that think that then you need to watch every single episode of Travel the Road and I promise you, you will be amazed at what God can and will do through you with just His Word. The first few episodes are funny as well Tim and Will are young and are just starting off to unknown places. At this point I can't imagine not being a part of their journey...in other seasons they risk everything to reach people who are in Chernobyl knowing they might never be allowed to come back...now that is a disciple of Christ if I have ever seen one...that is Christ in action...he will go to any extreme to get to us and so will Will and Tim. It is not just talk, they have the actions to back it up...just watch for yourself. The one thing I was grateful for as when I first discovered Travel the Road they were done with season three so I knew when watching season 1 they would be okay as there are so many more episodes to watch. These boys can get themselves in situations and as impossible as the situation is God just turns it around each and every time. You want to see God work in mighty ways, want to see Christ in action, want to see how simple it can be to go and do...watch this, I promise you will never be the same ever again.",1456790400,,1790,4.102564102564102

8247188,4,B0012Q3T3Q,"shows them exploring and giving talks at churches in between, pretty cool idea, glad they filmed it-I like to see a bit of what missionary trips are like never got to go on one.",1394755200,,177,4.235294117647059
8247189,5,B0012Q3T3Q,Excellent to see the origins of Tim and Scott as they begin their journey of the great commission.  Thank-you!  Awesome!,1393027200,,120,4.95
8247190,1,B0012Q3T3Q,"This lost my interest before the first episode was finished playing.  They spent so much time getting ready to go, but never went.  It might have gotten better later, but I was too bored to find out.  I gave the DVDs to a local charity store.",1385337600,,242,4.217391304347826
8247191,5,B0012Q3T3Q,"Will and Tim are two young men who don't just talk about loving and serving Jesus, they actually do it. These two young men commit to going to some of the poorest and most remote countries in the world to preach the Gospel. They boldly go where many of us (myself included) would probably not go. But the fire and passion of God burns brightly in these young men. They have an incredible depth and trust in the Lord. They get sick (rom the food and bumpy roads) they get lost in the jungle, they experience persecution, and yet they continue on. The preach the word of God with great passion and people respond. Only Heaven will reveal the impact these two young men have had during their travels. I watched all twelve episodes in a couple of days and would defintiely like to see more. I will definitely be purchasing other seasons. If you are looking for a reality television show that gives an accurate pictures of frontier missions and has a solid Christian message, you can't go wrong with Travel the Road.",1342396800,5,1011,4.5
8247192,5,B0012Q3T3Q,"This dvd is so encouraging.  I am born again christian who is saved and radically transformed by His power.  This world is filled with casual christians and false preachers who's heart hunger for money and power rather than saving the soul or bringing Gospel to hurting and desperate peole by their deed and thuth.  Our Lord and Savior did not have place to lay His head on this earth suffered in everyway man can suffer and is killed to save our soul, yet so many using His name collecting fortune for their gain and their followers who is devoid of understanding supports them thinking they are doing God's will.  Many times I wonder just how many of us true believers are really out there?  Through Tim Scott and Will Decker's work I saw genuine faith, love, passion for His word which burns within me also, that is flowing from same Savior and one Holy spirit.  It is so wonderful to know!  If you thirst for righteousness buy this dvd and watch them.  You'll feel breath of fresh air refreshing your soul.
Tim Scott and Will Decker,  You are in our prayer.
Praise the Lord!",1273190400,5,1078,4.515463917525773
