2370225,5,B000A6T1WC,"It's been years since Butterflies - Series 1 & 2 were released on DVD here in The U.S..  What I can't understand is that there are two series to go before the DVD collection is complete.  Two seasons & one special.  Where are they????  The waiting is ridiculous!  I have e-mailed Acorn Media to enquire about the remaining seasons coming to DVD & have not heard anything back.  I will try yet again to get another e-mail to them.

[...]

I strongly implore all fans of fine british comedy & Butterflies, to let them know we want all the rest of the episodes & can be as stubborn as necessary till we get them.  I can see a couple of years between releases, but this length of time is insane.

Anyway, yes, I obviously highly recommend Butterflies (seasons 1 & 2 & the rest whenever they are put to DVD)! ;-)",1252713600,19,807,4.28476821192053
2370226,5,B000A6T1WC,"If you are a fan of British sitcoms such as As Time Goes By (starring Geoffrey Palmer and A Fine Romance (starring Dame Judi Dench), then you will more than likely like this. I own seasons 1 and 2, and it is a different pace for Geoffrey Palmer, but he is wonderful to watch in it.",1242172800,5,281,4.035714285714286
2370227,3,B000A6T1WC,"Picture quality is not as good as it should or could be, but maybe because of the time it was produced (1970's) it couldn't be reproduced to enhance the quality???  Otherwise, I am enjoying this DVD.",1180656000,2,199,4.527777777777778
2370228,5,B000A6T1WC,"The private hell of Rhea Parkinson continues.  She has a loving husband, who is rather boring and two grown sons who keep her in constant flux.  Add to this a millionaire who is infatuated with her.

Season Two has eight 30 minute episodes on two discs.  The episodes shown on PBS were only 28 minutes.

Disc One:

Episode 1 -  Adam has been dumped by his girlfriend Annie and is in a funk over it.  Now the family must get him up again.  But remember that no matter how bad things get Ria's cooking will always be worse.

Episode 2 - Rhea is upset by a fox hunt and decides to have a protest (this was a very big issue at the time.)  This leaves the boys to make lunch for Ben - and they have inherited their mother's cooking talents.

Episode 3 - Ben has chest pains and begins to think about his old age.  Ria decides to cook to help him stay fit (do I need to say more) and of course runs into Leonard.  Ben takes up jogging and runs into Leonard (of course he doesn't know who Leonard is!)

Episode 4 - The Parkinsons get new neighbors across the road.  Ben is forced to meet the husband when the boys throw their Frisbee in his car.  Ria is having one of ""her days"". Ria finds out the neighbor's wife has problems too when she runs into her at the chapel then at the doctor's office and finally talks to her at the park.  (This is one of the great episodes)

Disc Two:

Episode 5 - Leonard is sick.  Ben has to cope with the boys and their girls making out all over the house.  When Ria does not run into Leonard, she gets worried.  Ria tries to be more romantic with Ben.

Episode 6 - A holiday acquaintance comes to visit and stirs up trouble.

Episode 7 - Leonard tells Ria goodbye.  Ben talks to the boys about life.  Ben books a table at the restaurant where she and Leonard met.

Episode 8 - This is the Christmas Special. It was never aired on PBS.  Ria runs into Leonard for the first time since his wife came home.  Ria is frightened by Christmas - the one time of year that food is important.  And when the turkey arrives with its head and feet still on, Ria just can't cope and agrees to meet with Leonard.",1144800000,17,2123,4.117359413202934
2370229,5,B000A6T1WC,"I had never heard of this series, but I recognized Geoffrey Palmer from one of my favorite Britcoms ""As Time Goes By"".  Although this series is from the 70's it still seems relevant and is very entertaining.  I adore Ria's rants about the boredom of being a housewife.  Her flirtations with Leonard are cute and touching.  Both Ria and Leonard deal with feelings of life passing by much too quickly and whether or not they are living it to their fullest.",1141776000,19,454,4.567901234567901

2370300,5,B000A6T1WC,"I love this series! Wendy Craig does an awesome job of playing Rhea, devoted to her dull dentist husband and flirting with Leonard, but never having the affair. So nuanced and lovely! I wish the other seasons were available in the US.",1415923200,3,234,4.595238095238095

2370302,5,B000A6T1WC,I love this show and I'm so glad to have the first two seasons on DVD. Now if only they'd release the rest of the series for North American fans.*sigh*,1409788800,3,151,4.066666666666666
2370303,5,B000A6T1WC,"This British romantic comedy from the 70s, is what I used to watch all the time on PBS here in the US. Even though it's from the 70s, the show could easily be about today. Wendy Craig has perfect comic timing as a housewife who feels she deserves more credit(""Instead of having a mess over there - we have it over here.""), and we learn that Geoffrey Palmer's character, an authoritarian husband and father, can be romantic, and is also more aware of things than he lets out.",1401321600,4,474,4.3977272727272725
2370304,5,B000A6T1WC,"I saw this series when it first was shown on TV and have been waiting for the DVD to be for sale, I am very pleased to be able to buy this series and will buy more to give away.",1362355200,2,177,3.45
2370305,5,B000A6T1WC,"This is an over the top period piece from the sixties or early seventies I would guess.
If you've ever been in a relationship where you are undervalued but afraid to burn your bridges you'll enjoy this immensely.
Wendy Craig is intelligent, vivacious and caring.  Geoffrey Palmer, (who seems to be in most BritComs) the husband, truly loves Ria, but has the worse sense of timing and is always doing the wrong thing.  He wants to change but is stuck in his old school chauvanism. Her two sons pour gasoline on the relationship but mean well. Between some very poignant moments, you'll find yourself laughing.  Set at the dawn of the women's lib movement, Wendy is torn between being unfaithful with an unwanted suitor and constantly giving her situation another chance.  I suspect it could become therapy if viewed with your significant other.  Overall, excellent, well done and one of my favorite guilty pleasures.",1362096000,3,915,4.915584415584416
2370306,4,B000A6T1WC,If you enjoy BBC comedies then you will like this one.  It takes place in the 70's so be aware that the clothes and lingo reflect that time.,1357344000,2,140,4.0
2370307,4,B000A6T1WC,"Geoffrey Palmer in his younger days- an enjoyable series  --but personally,he has aged very well,and he is
better in AS TIME GOES BY  with Judi Dench....and a young Nicholas Lyndhurst was a treat too....",1282694400,2,203,4.9411764705882355

8075200,5,B000A6T1WC,"If you have not seen Butterflies the description of it by Amazon is fairly good.  I grew up watching Butterflies as a child with my family, one of the things that struck me even then is that we all got something different out of it, but also all got a good laugh out of it.  For me as I child, I enjoyed the sons Adam and Russell and their mini.  For my mother, she identified with Rita and her plight (including the cooking).  As far as my father goes, even though he was not a dentist but a shipbuilder, he seemed to identify with the dentist and the family as a unit.  So if you enjoy British humour and sitcoms from the late 70's and early 80's this might just be for you in one way or another.",1483574400,,698,4.028985507246377
