7915600,3,B00002CGFU,"Ricci, one of my favorite violinists, every piece performed masterly, it was too bad the video is from a single portable camera, plays Bach 1004, Bartok, Prokofiev and Ysaye sonatas, Vals Mephisto, works by Paganinni, Tarrega, Ernst, Hindemith and Kreisler on two VHS, just good for violinist to watch, really, very bad tecnicall production",1073520000,4,340,5.314814814814815
7915601,3,B00002CGFU,"I saw the film partially and agree that the title is wrong.
 This film is for people interested in violin playing
from a half professional point of view.
Ricci is an outstanding musician and has hundreds of audio recordings.
He wrote recently a nice book on violin playing: ""Left Hand Technique"" again for advancing violinists, not for beginners.
The film gives a rare possibility not only to listen but also
to see him playing an extremely interesting program.
I put 3 stars for relatively low technical quality of the film.
It is pity that some people wrote about the film agressively.",1039651200,,587,4.811881188118812
7915602,1,B00002CGFU,"I am amazed that Amazon even allows this thing on their list. It's a good example of what happens when someone who hasn't a clue about how to make an instructional film has a go at it.  The bright side? You might sell the cassette for a dollar at a thrift store, where someone may find it useful for erasing and overtaping an episode of Mad TV.I wish it was possible to give it zero stars.",1011484800,,389,4.118421052631579
7915603,1,B00002CGFU,"I bought this video as a gift for someone who was interested in learning how to play the violin.  After she got it and watched it, she called me to see if there was a mistake.  What a waste of money.  DO NOT BUY THIS  VIDEO!  There must be something better out there...",949017600,34,269,4.0
7915604,1,B00002CGFU,"You'd think from the title that you might be able to use this video to help learn the violin.  Think again.
It shows Ricci from a camera angle in front of him and above him as he plays.  That's it.  Okay, can you at  least see his fingering and bowing?  No.
The film is poorly focused and  looks to be worse quality than most home video.  The video isn't clear  enough to see what the fingers are doing nor what string the bow is  touching.  As the fingers and bow move, all you see is a blur.
What a  waste of money.  It only gets 1 star because that's as low as you can go.",946339200,55,575,3.9043478260869566
