4461030,4,B004RPQSPK,"Yes, it's filming is very dated but if you can get past that its a great story plot.  I'm going to see if there is a book because the story is quite unique and not your typical post-WWII story.",1372032000,,193,3.948717948717949
4461031,3,B004RPQSPK,"Very interesting combination of talent, and fairly interesting if convoluted tale.  Ingrid Thulin is a concentration camp survivor who returns ""from the ashes"" to find her philandering, younger chess master husband (Maximillian Schell) involved with a younger woman (Samantha Eggar) to whom she is also connected.  The screenplay isn't nearly as clever as it tries to be, but it's fun to see Eggar play nasty, and her bathtub scene IS quite well done.  J. Lee Thompson's career went disastrously downhill after this.  The streaming version is standard-def letterboxed, but of good quality.",1361836800,,589,5.369565217391305
4461032,5,B004RPQSPK,"J. Lee Thompson's ""Return from the Ashes"" was not a success when it premiered in 1965. This perhaps was inevitable; the film's overall air of decadence was probably too much for most audiences of the time. But the film has lapsed into obscurity, and that is totally undeserved. ""Return from the Ashes"" is a compelling film noir, performed superbly by its quartet of stars.

Thompson and screenwriter Julius J. Epstein preserve a mood throughout that combines uneasy suspense with perverse sexiness. The perversity is built into the story: set in Paris just after World War II, ""Return from the Ashes"" concerns the love triangle between a woman doctor who survived the Holocaust (Ingrid Thulin); her worthless chessmaster husband (Maximilian Schell); and her grown stepdaughter from a previous marriage (Samantha Eggar). The mind games played by these three--and especially the machinations of the latter two--form the bulk of the plot. Herbert Lom, as Thulin's professional colleague and best friend, provides the film's lone voice of sanity.

""Return from the Ashes"" hooks you from the first scene, a real shocker that also serves brilliantly to establish Thulin's character. The film quality could be better (a note at the beginning warns that the DVD was assembled from the best remaining film stock), and there are no extras except the film's original trailer. But those are minor complaints. Anchored by the unforgettable score from the great John Dankworth, ""Return from the Ashes"" is a must for all fans of film noir.",1357257600,8,1524,5.165991902834008
4461033,4,B004RPQSPK,"From opening scenes to climax, you wonder who will win-- the wife who returned from Dachau prison camp or chess champion/cheating husband.  Throw in a sexy step-daughter and an ever-faithful friend and the plot thickens, right up to the very end.",1337990400,3,246,5.0
4461034,5,B004RPQSPK,"1965's ""Return from the Ashes"" was rarely shown on television and it now has a hugely deserving presentation by UA/MGM on DVD-R.  The production starred Maximilian Schell, Samantha Eggar (who had just won Best Actress that year at Cannes for ""The Collector"") and Ingrid Thulin as directed by J. Lee Thompson (who brought us ""Tiger Bay,"" ""Guns of Navarone"" and the original ""Cape Fear"").  It is based on the novel by Hubert Monteilhet, but the brilliance of this production can be found in the changes made by screenplay author Julius Epstein.  Described as a ""journey into the diabolical"" the screenplay sites the capability of the characters to allow all things permissible... even murder.  The DVD does not do justice to the film's plot, which not only shocked audiences with the tagline, ""No one may enter the theater once Fabi enters her bath!,"" but was daring in that when his wife Michelle (Thulin) returns from Dachau, Pilgrin (Schell) is having an affair with his stepdaughter, Fabienne (Eggar).  The DVD packaging (the MGM/UA ""print on demand"" capabilities are the most problematic handled by a major studio) slights the plot indicating falsely that Pilgrin remarried after Michelle was ""dragged off to her apparent death"" and then the former wife re-appears.  I think one can see that this indiscretion greatly robs the potential viewer of a sense of the temptation of the characters in a film that was quite daring in its day.  Everything about this film, truly a baptism, is charged by a brilliance of acting, writing, producing and directing, music (by John Dankworth) and black and white cinematography (by Christopher Challis) that in its exhilarating creativity deserves to be seen often.",1301875200,30,1704,5.086021505376344
4461035,4,B004RPQSPK,"This sinister, monochrome menage-a-trois is a rarely seen thriller directed by J. Lee Thompson, and handled with his usual efficiency.  It starts with a very effective pre-credit sequence and a moody title theme by John Dankworth, and the guilty pleasures proceed as the convoluted relationship between the three, perfectly-pitched leads unfolds.
This 1965 United Artists release is a DVD-R from the MGM vaults and the print element used is very acceptable; the black-and-white scope photography by Christopher Challis is very appealing.  The disc is anamorphic 2:35-to-1 Panavision, with serviceable optical monaural sound (2.0 mastered).  The lurid original trailer is the only extra.  Those interested in this minor gem should be pleased with this release.",1301616000,26,759,5.631578947368421
8439167,5,B004RPQSPK,"I saw Return from the Ashes when it was new in the late 'sixties and on television in the mid-'eighties.  In college I read the book on which it is based (it was a translation, original is in French).  It is truly excellent and Hollywood doesn't spend money to produce superb material like this anymore.  I am so glad that it is FINALLY out on DVD and that one can also stream it.  Thulin is landmark-superb in it.",1483315200,,414,4.269230769230769

8439171,5,B004RPQSPK,"This is an excellent suspense film, brilliantly shot in black and white.  The performances of the leads (Maximillian Schell, Ingrid Thulin, Samantha Eggar and Herbert Lom) are terrific.  A great film with a neat ending twist.  Unfortunately, the version being shown on Amazon Instant Video is non-anamorphic.  Therefore, the picture size is really small, with black borders on all four sides of the picture.

8439172,5,B004RPQSPK,"Brilliant psychological drama dfirected by J. Lee Thompson.  Memorable musical theme ftom John Dankworth.  Plot focuses on a worthless
opportunistit (Maximillian Schell) who marries a wealthy Jewish woman doctor (Ingrid Thulan) during WWII.  She is imprisoned by the Nazi's
but survives.  She returns to find her husbanfd now involved with her daughter from her earlier marriage.  The plot manuvers the view  through
attempts at murder and varied manipulation but does resolve itself in the end.  Herbert Lom is quite good as another doctor who secretly loves
Ingrid Thulin.  He is instrumental in bring the situation to a realistic resolution.  Very sustaining, intereting and satisfying on all levels.  Samantha
Eggar is particularly impish and self-serving as the daughter.",1425772800,,776,5.555555555555555
8439173,4,B004RPQSPK,"""Return from the Ashes"" begins with a disturbing pre-credit sequence. A little boy kicks repeatedly at a door on a crowded train until it flies open. Only one passenger, a beautiful, haunted-looking woman (Ingrid Thulin) is not shocked; the concentration camp number on her arm indicates that she has seen too much to register emotion at yet one more death.

Everything in ""Return from the Ashes"" works at a high emotional pitch, although credulity is stretched to breaking point along the way. The true quality of this film is not revealed from a reading of the plot. The movie plays far better than it reads.

In Paris shortly before WW2, Michelle Wolf, a doctor played by Ingrid Thulin meets a Polish refugee, Stanislaus Pilgrin (Maximilian Schell). Although warned that he is only after her money, she marries him. However, when the Germans capture Paris, Michelle, who is Jewish, is sent to a concentration camp.

Years later, Michelle returns to Paris under an assumed name. But she is a changed woman. Thought to be dead, no one recognises her at first (despite those killer cheekbones and that smouldering sensuality). She is reacquainted with Stanislaus and her stepdaughter, the beautiful Fabi (Samantha Eggar}, although they believe she simply bears a strong resemblance to the Michelle they once knew.

As the complicated plot plays out, Michelle reveals her true identity, and Fabi and Stanislaus are revealed as lovers. From there the story becomes much darker. After more developments, the movie still has enough energy left to deliver one final twist at the end.

""Return from the Ashes"" boasts three of the most attractive stars you are likely to see in one movie: Ingrid Thulin, Maximilian Schell and Samantha Eggar. For me, Ingrid Thulin is the standout. Strikingly beautiful with a look that suggested a lot more going on below the surface, it's surprising Hollywood didn't seek her out more often. Possibly she would have made one of the great Hitchcock blondes - in an interview, he once singled her out as the epitome of the kind of sexiness he admired, especially in her work for Ingmar Bergman.

Although mostly set indoors, this is a classy-looking film, shot in moody black and white. It also has a distinctive score by John Dankworth with a lilting, zither-flavoured main theme.

""Return from the Ashes"" does not seem overly influenced by either Hitchcock or film noir. The look and feel of the film is due to J. Lee Thompson's personal style. The man who made ""Cape Fear"" proved once again that he could make a thriller to stand with the best of them.",1414972800,3,2580,4.9036697247706424
8439174,3,B004RPQSPK,"This review is not for the film but for the DVD-R sold through MGM's Limited Edition Collection.  It would not play in an LG Blu-ray or Panasonic DVD player, but finally played in a less expensive LG Blu-ray player purchased the same year as the other LG Blu-ray.  Though it played in the third player, the image stuttered at least a half-dozen times throughout the course of the film.  For the record, I have never had an issue with a Warner Archives DVD-R, of which I own several dozen, in any of my Blu-ray or DVD players.  My conclusion is that MGM needs to get on the ball!",1411344000,,578,4.324074074074074
8439175,5,B004RPQSPK,"The story is great and so is the acting...the only thing that was somewhat annoying was Shell's strangely-funny & arrogant accent.
Other than that that the movie is a great example of a dark-noir with a much more sexier and Hitchcock-appeal to it.
The end of the movie is pretty intense...and the whole story reads like a book.",1388880000,,327,4.655172413793103
8439176,5,B004RPQSPK,"In the movie ""Return from the Ashes"" a man's illicit love affair with his beautiful step-daughter, results in a murder plot to kill his  wife and a twisted ending.  Maximilian Schell plays an impoverished chess master named Stanislaus Pilgrin who connects with a Jewish Doctor named Michele Wolf played by Ingrid Thulin in pre World War II France.  Michele Wolf apparently dies in a Nazis Concentration Camp, only to return to Paris after the end of World War II and find her step-daughter Fabienne Wolf played by Samantha Eggar is living with Stan.  Fabienne concocts a plan to kill her mother and invites Stan into the plot.  Stan refuses Fabi's invitation but decides to kill both Fabi and Michelle. Samantha Eggar's performance as the evil step-daughter is excellent, as are the performances by Schell and Thulin.  I enjoyed the DVD and I would recommend purchase of ""Return from the Ashes"" for your DVD collection.",1377993600,3,919,4.935064935064935
