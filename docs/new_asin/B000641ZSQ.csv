8038057,2,B000641ZSQ,The second episode on this DVD is supposed to be Murder for Sale.  The title is there but both the description and the episode itself are incorrect.  The quality of the video is also not very good.  It is somewhat fuzzy compared to other DVDs made of TV shows from the same time period.,1374710400,,286,4.2592592592592595

8038059,3,B000641ZSQ,"I remembering Mr & Mrs North as a program that I always like, but I was a lot younger then. I have bought a lot of old black and white, (ie) hoppilong and moto, charlie chain mr wong and it was clear, but Mr. and Mrs North was not as I remembered and it was fuzzy. The plot was just as fuzzy as well as the acting.

I gave it a 3 star for memories on vol 2 but I don't feel that vol 1 will be better.

8038060,3,B000641ZSQ,"More over Jonathan and Jennifer. The 1950's TV equivalent of ""Hart to Hart"" was the offbeat murder-mystery series MR. & MRS. NORTH. When it became apparent that Richard Denning wasn't going to be automatically re-cast opposite Lucille Ball in ""I Love Lucy"" (the show inspired by the radio serial ""My Favourite Husband"" in which he had starred with Ball), Denning took the role of Jerry North, a publisher who also dabbles in sleuthing with his lovely wife Pamela (Barbara Britton).

MR. & MRS. NORTH was based on a series of novellas written by Richard Lockridge; the characters were later featured in a long-running radio serial, which started out in 1946 and ended up airing concurrently with the TV series (which debuted in 1952). The TV series of MR. & MRS. NORTH, sponsored by Revlon Cosmetics, played on CBS from 1952-53, and was later picked up by NBC for additional episodes in 1954.

Episodes:

""Flight 217"" - After helping their old friend Detective Paco try to solve a missing persons case in Mexico City, Jerry and Pamela North book their flight and head for the States, unaware that aboard their plane there is a time-bomb ticking away in a piece of luggage.

""Murder for Sale"" - A flat tyre during a drenching rainstorm leaves Jerry and Pam stranded late at night near a lonely house in the woods. A woman's muffled screams and a scrawled message on an upstairs bedroom window lure the couple inside where they discover a basement full of horrors.

""Two Faced"" - A notorious murderer visits Jerry North's neighbourhood barbershop where the shop's manicurist recognizes the wanted man. She concocts a plan to blackmail the fugitive, but the plan backfires and the outcome turns deadly.

""Breakout"" - The warden of the State Penitentiary invites the Norths to interview a high-profile inmate for a possible book. During the visit, a prison disturbance escalates into a frightening confrontation when Pamela and Jerry are taken hostage by a gang of desperate convicts.",1129852800,,1979,4.945783132530121
