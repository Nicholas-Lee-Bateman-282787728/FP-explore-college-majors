8611733,2,B00F2N50XC,"This is not like a Alfred Hitchcock film as one well known critic has claimed.  It's slow to get going into the main story line, lingers in meaninglessness, then disappoints in the end.  Another example of how critics are compromised.",1526601600,,234,4.825

8611735,4,B00F2N50XC,"This independent film is predominantly in Italian (the alternate title is Il Futuro) and subtitles only appear (if they are turned on) for the Italian portions of the dialog, because part is in English anyhow.

When one watches a film one has never seen nor read about, its like entering a strangers life.  You don't know if youll find it terrible, fascinating or boring.  I found this film more interesting than most American films.

Rutger Hauers character is, in a way, a fictionalized version of himself: an ageing former Mr. Universe and film actor, who was once popular in the role of Hercules.  In his old age he lives alone in a large, decrepit mansion (the depredations of aging visible in the house as in our bodies).  Most of the interior scenes are shot in dim light, and the large rooms, filled with mysterious big paintings and furniture semi-haphazardly placed, apparently accumulated over a lifetime or over several generations, convey a sense of mystery.

The movie starts with a young couple: Bianca (Manuela Martelli) and Tomas (Luigi Ciardo), suddenly orphaned at ages 19 and 17 by the death of their parents in a car accident.  A well-meaning social worker comes by to see if Bianca feels capable of looking after her younger brother until he finishes high school, or if he will need to be placed in a foster home.  He looks at her wordlessly, and she quickly tells the social worker that she will look after him.  The social worker assures her that she won't be simply left alone; that they will come by periodically to check on her and her brother-at which point her figure gradually becomes transparent and disappears [giving you an idea of the way this story is told: visually more than with words]

Tomas soon starts skipping school and attending a gym, where he hopes to be hired on as an assistant.  Bianca obtains a starter job at a hairdresser shop.  Then one day Tomass friends from the gym come home with him with a startling proposition for Biancaone they hope will transform all their futures for the better [hence the title].  They know Rutger Hauers character [Maciste] because this was the gym where he always worked out.  He still maintains contact with staff therejust about his only contact with the outside world, it seems.  He relies on them to provide an occasional young woman for an evenings company.  Rumor has it he doesnt trust banks, and therefore he must keep his life savings in a safe hidden somewhere in the house.  The gym rats propose that Bianca get to know him, find the location of the safe and steal the money, which theyll split evenly.

The economy is hard.  The Italy this depicts is still wracked by the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2009.  Bianca and Tomas receive their fathers pension but their mothers didn't transfer over.  Bianca explains, in one of her voiceovers, that theres barely enough money to pay for food; nothing left for other necessities.  In one of the fascinating lines of the movie she says, People say that something happened to the economy of Europeof Italyof our townour neighborhood  Whatever the reasons, times are a lot harder than she remembers as a child.  I loved this tersely conveyed vagueness, which surely we all feel at times in our livesthat something is wrong but we aren't sure exactly what caused it.  Different people have their different theories, but the only clear thing is that something somewhere has gone wrong.  Apparently for want of money, she goes along with the plan.

Her initial scene with Rutger isnot exactly romantic but surprisingly tender.  He pays her well and wants her to return, which she does.  She learns that he lost his eyesight, also in an auto accident of some sort, which he doesnt want to talk about any more than she wants to talk about the death of her parents.

The story evolves from therea girl talked into a would-be crime which she feels increasingly disinclined to carry out as she gets to know this old man better.  Ill leave the remainder of the plot unrevealed, and simply say that I liked how much the dialog conveyed with a minimum of words.  Also the camera is on Biancas face for much of the movie (often close-up) and she has to convey her thoughts and emotions simply through facial expression.  I think she did a fine job with this demanding part.  This is no action film; its a film to be approached gradually, like sitting on a park bench for an hour or two, just to enjoy the sunset, the slow transition from late afternoon to early evening.  I give it a B+.",1442966400,,4519,4.675949367088608

8611737,5,B00F2N50XC,If you like Bolao you'll love this. Director gives the film the same atmospheric quality one feels in Roberto Bolao's books. Very beautiful film.,1415318400,,145,5.083333333333333
8611738,4,B00F2N50XC,"A surprisingly compelling movie. Two Chilean teenagers living in Rome (Bianca and Tomas) became orphans when their parents die in a car accident. Living now alone in an apartment, they soon drop school and find some jobs to sustain themselves: she in a hair salon, he in a gym. Soon, Tomas brings two dubious friends from the gym to live with them in their apartment. These friends, who seem to easily manipulate Tomas, eventually engage Bianca in a seemingly harebrained plot: she has to seduce a former bodybuilder and sword and sandals star named Maciste (played by the veteran Dutch actor Rutger Hauer), who is blind and lives as a recluse in an old mansion in Rome, so she can find the safe in his house where he presumably keeps his fortune. So the rest of the movie is about how the strange relationship between Bianca and Maciste develops. Only the ending is unsatisfying. Playing Bianca, the pretty, petite Manuela Martelli looks a bit sour and expressionless, but is compelling as she appears about half the running time in the nude along the much older Hauer. Based on a novel by the prestigious Chilean novelist Roberto Bolao.",1390694400,,1138,4.781725888324873
8611739,1,B00F2N50XC,"I rented this movie because I loved Alicia Scherson's 2005 movie titled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Play/dp/B001H1NQHK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Play</a>, which was delightful. This movie was not. It was relentlessly depressing until the very last few seconds, but by that time I had long since ceased to care what happened to any of the obnoxious characters.

Lesbians and straight men might enjoy watching a teenage Italian girl walk around totally naked and covered in some kind of oil for 90 minutes, but only sleazy fat old men could enjoy watching her have paid sex repeatedly with a sleazy fat old man. The ONLY few seconds of this horrible movie that were tolerable AT ALL were some views of Rome not normally shown in movies.

The respect I had for Scherson after seeing Play has been demolished. I've re-watched Play several times and loved it more each time, but I'd rather have my arm amputated than watch this movie again.",1387929600,,983,5.376623376623376
8611740,4,B00F2N50XC,"This unique coming-of-age tale focuses on a young woman named Bianca, played by Manuela Martelli.  When her parents are killed in a car accident, she and her brother Tomas are left orphaned and in a financially dubious situation.  While she is not a minor, he is, and they are faced with two options: Bianca can become head of the household, or forfeit those duties and leave Tomas to fend for himself in an orphanage.  It's a sink or swim situation, and Bianca decides to take on the role of matriarch.  Out of necessity, the siblings are ultimately forced to get jobs - while still in school - to supplement the meager pension they receive from their late father.  Tomas becomes involved with some sketchy characters from the local gym, and the foursome hatches a plan to rob a blind and aging ex-actor of his money.  The catch?  Bianca must earn his trust.  Once inside his rotting mansion, it is easy to get physically close to the Maciste.  What isn't easy is finding his rumored hidden fortune.  And the hardest part of all is the array of complicated, impossible emotions Bianca is beginning to feel for the veteran thespian, portrayed both convincingly and brilliantly by Rutger Hauer.

  Oddly sensual and perversely heartbreaking, this film leaves you wanting more.  If you like unusual romantic scenarios, this is for you.  If you like Rutger Hauer, this is DEFINITELY for you.  The subtitles are not that distracting, and there are literally entire portions of the movie that are in English.  As far as cinematography goes, the movie isn't exactly fancy.  I felt that the envelope honestly could have been pushed further in certain regards, particularly emotionally.  However, some might argue that THAT is where this film derives much of its strength from.  The fact that it takes an economical approach regarding style and emotional virility makes it dryly raw - in fact, slightly painful - for the viewer, but in a good way.  My only other criticisms might be that the film's conclusion is somewhat vague and open-ended.  Again, some might prefer this, as it leaves something to the imagination.  (It is also important to note that, while some viewers might have the desire to learn more about surrounding characters, the story is told from Bianca's perspective, thus there is less of an emphasis on the rest of the cast and a much more concentrated focus on her and the Maciste, as well as their ensuing relationship).

  This movie is not for everyone.  However, I strongly recommend it, and cannot wait to watch it again.",1387065600,4,2539,4.830626450116009
8611741,3,B00F2N50XC,"I don't really understand how this received such favorable reviews.  An Italian brother and sister lose their parents in a car crash, get involved with some shady friends, and try to draw on their very limited life experience to score some easy money.  The object of their scheme is a blind American who was once a highly paid movie star.  I appreciated the moral dilemma this young girl found herself increasingly saddened by, but it would have been more interested if she was in some way forced to confess being a con artist.  Without spoiling the end, I wanted to know more about what became of these 3 characters.",1386115200,,617,4.63302752293578
