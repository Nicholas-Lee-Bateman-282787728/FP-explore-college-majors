8226822,4,B000X3BB2A,"I've had this production for several years and I did a review of the 'other' version&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rossini-La-Pietra-del-Paragone/dp/B000V9M0IK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rossini - La Pietra del Paragone</a>&nbsp;by Spinosi and Ensemble Matheus, but thought it was time to reflect on this one having watched again the other night.  Of the two, the Spinosi is definitely the better production, but watching this Madrid version makes you realise a few things about the opera and Rossini.  So talking about the opera itself, it a quite early work and you can sense in it the 'skeletal' framework that Rossini will use in later operas - to much better results overall. It's a bit like reading a project report or essay from earlier student days. For a start it's probably longer than it needs to be. We could do without that duel scene in Act 2 for example. There's a bit too much of the side characters Pacuvio and Macrobio and their associated action. So why do you keep wanting to see it every so often and why do you really enjoy it when you do? A catchy sort of thematic sound runs through the whole work and there are some great arias, duets and ensembles.  The chorus plays a minimal but useful and entertaining role moving the story along at points and it's basically an evergreen story. Who are your friends really in times of need? What does it take to commit to love? How shallow and sycophantic can some people be? While the libretto might be in need of some editing, there are some great lines, at one point Count Asdrubale the main character who believes all women are fickle and probably just out for his money sings, 'la fede e mal sicura dove regna la belta' (faithfulness/constancy is less secure where beauty reigns) in the 'echo' aria with Clarice (who really does genuinely love him). So it's got all the ingredients for a good opera: good story, some snappy dialog and Rossini's masterful touch with glimpses of the famous Rossini crescendo taking shape at different points.
As to this version, you have to wonder why it's not as good as the aforementioned Spinosi one. There a strong cast in Marco Vinco, Pietro Spagnoli (who will go onto bigger and better things at the Met), a young Paolo Bordogna (currently the world's foremost buffo singer) and amazingly Raul Gimenez probably enticed out of near retirement for the Spanish audience who does a fantastic job - his 'Quell'alme pupille io serbo nel seno' always gets me and it's the best version of this aria i've heard. I think the Clarice with Marie-Ange Todorovich is a weak point though, she's capable as a singer but is unconvincing in the role.
It's conducted by Alberto Zedda the guru of Rossini performance and long associated with the Pesaro Rossini festival, who gets the whole thing moving along at a jaunty pace. The setting has a 'Dolce Vita' feel to it as the story could transpose to anywhere, anytime you have someone with wealth and a couterie of hangers-on.
The glimpses of that audience in Madrid though is a real downer. Is it characteristic of a Spanish audience? Spagnoli like to audience walk in some of his productions but here it looks like he's walking through a funeral assembly!
In any case - If you're a Rossini lover or like works from this early 1800 period of emerging Italian opera - do yourself a favour and get into La Pietra. You'll find for some magical reason that you keep wanting to come back to La Pietra.",1452902400,,3479,4.843697478991596
8226823,5,B000X3BB2A,"We got a lot of pleasure, looking the opera. All singers are known to all lovers of opera: Marco Vinko, Pietro Spagnoli and especially Paolo Bordogna. This opera creates a good mood and joy of beautiful voices and their coherence. Thank You. Helena and Alexander.",1431302400,,263,4.866666666666666
8226824,3,B000X3BB2A,"This came with good magazine reviews. Then along came another on the Naive label with Spinosi conducting. I bought both and initially enjoyed them differently. I now much prefer the Spinosi's version. My wife initially preferred this one though as she found the other too gimmicky. We now only have one version - guess which!

Personally I think there is room in the catalogue for both as both are well-sung and well recorded. Both are updated to modern times and this requires a complete suspension of disbelief on the part of the viewer. But surely that was always the case as the story is so, well, unbelievable.

A major difference between the two is that the rival version on Naive makes use of large display screens to project enlarged images of the singers superimposed within various settings and with various artefacts. This is supposed to be witty - and so it is - the first time. I, however, have continued to enjoy it increasingly as I find the singers more dramatically successful and I now find the characterisation of the version being considered here inherently duller by comparison. The orchestral playing on original instruments is also far sharper and incisive as conducted by Spinosi.

So there you have it. For me the choice is clear - get the other version with Spinosi conducting with total flair.",1342915200,2,1320,4.831858407079646
8226825,3,B000X3BB2A,"I admit up front that I took a chance on this recording of La Pietra del Paragone as nobody had yet bothered to create a review. I had seen a small film clip of the work on the Opus Arte website which intrigued me into wanting to see more and I already owned the other `high-tech' version of this work from the Chatelet Theatre, so I had some idea of what to expect.

Well, I was disappointed. This is obviously one of Rossini's less well-known works and certainly not one of his best. The work being reviewed appears to take place in the large rear garden of a very modern two-story villa during the timeframe of one afternoon. An odd assortment of colorfully dressed men and women seem to move from one table to another with drinks in hand while others attempt to play tennis or cavort in and around a small swimming pool. That seems to be the full content of the opera from beginning to end. There is not enough to interest oneself in any of the singers; most of who sing reasonably well. It is unfortunate that none of them appears very interesting as characters. Although much money appears to have been spent on the stageset, no changes occur throughout the work and the lighting, meant to represent a warm and sunny afternoon, is constant. Perhaps, if the time frame had extended into the early evening and for the lighting within the villa on stage to create a different ambience I might have become more interested in this work.

By contrast, the other version mentioned, has the terrific presence of the wonderfully expressive actress and singer Sonia Prima in a leading roll and she certainly makes the most of it. On top of this, having split screens and trick video effects with stagehands manipulating scenery in full view of the audience, but covered from head to toe in blue so that they do not appear against the blue screen, with the combined results appearing on screens suspended above the performers, prevent any possibility of boredom setting in. One is constantly waiting to see what new surprise will appear on stage next, and one is not disappointed.",1235606400,8,2075,4.62059620596206
