2881333,5,B000S5NV62,"We also have ""welcome to word world"" and we love them both!  This has some really fun episodes on it.  My 2 year old son just loves Word World.  He loves the animals and he says the words that they build.  He even likes us to sing him the theme song.  These dvd's are fun, silly, educational, and engaging - It doesn't get much better!

(One of our dvd players is pretty old and so the video is a little choppy when we watch this - but it plays just fine in our newer dvd player - the old one might just not know the proper encoding for this new dvd - just thought I would add that incase anyone else encountered that problem)",1201651200,,626,4.008064516129032
2881334,5,B000S5NV62,"This for me, is the best kids show out there. We've loved Dora, Bob, Elmo and the baby Einstein shows...but nothing is as good as Word World. My sons get to choose one show they want to watch every day, for the last four days in a row they have chosen Word World (since we bought it!). They are almost 2 and almost 4. My 4 yr. old now knows the letters that they practice on Word World. Today he was spelling ""P-I-E, pie!"" and ""t-r-e-e, tree!"".
This is the best show yet!",1201219200,2,471,4.075268817204301
2881335,5,B000S5NV62,"Word World is without a doubt or any qulification the best childrens show to come along in a very long time. It showcases PBS main strength actual learning.  Most other kids shows available for viewing on Disney, Nickelodeon etc...offer decison making help, social skill building and imagination. All important but PBS produces shows that teach. My daughters have learned a tremendous amount from this show. My 5 year old loves it and often exclaims that she can spell the various words with glee. She's been able to read early reader books with ease and I credit a lot to this show. Both her and my 3 year participate avidly with the pronunciation by the characters.  The other bonus is that this show is very watchable as an adult. Which is really something that can't be stressed enough.  If the parents can handle watching it then we are much more likely to contribute to the educational value.  Vibrant colors cute scenarios and characters. Highly recommended.",1200960000,,965,4.865853658536586
2881336,5,B000S5NV62,"We stumbled on this on PBS, and my 2-year old absolutely loves it.  I even like to watch it--it's pretty funny.  I can't say how glad I am to see DVDs of this show coming out since I can't get it on demand!",1194220800,4,206,3.7674418604651163
2881337,5,B000S5NV62,"This is a wonderful kids show!  My 3 1/2 year old son adores it - he sings along and pretends to build words just like the characters.  It is visually appealing with lovable, non-annoying characters.  My son loves the stories and being able to pick out many of the letter.  Great, educational, program!!",1193270400,3,303,4.660377358490566
2881338,5,B000S5NV62,"This is, in my opinion, the BEST kids' show to come around in a very, very long time.  It helps kids recognize their letters, sound out words, and spell, which I appreciate.  However, learning aside- this show is fantastic.  It is HILARIOUS, the characters are well-developed and lovable, and the quality is fantastic.
I know this show is meant for preschoolers, but my 7 year old loves it too.  She is a beginning reader, and she feels very cool being able to recognize all the words in WordWorld. I am preordering both DVDs, and in the meantime we'll continue to catch it on PBS.",1191888000,5,581,4.5576923076923075
2881339,5,B000S5NV62,It's a cute & fun way for your kids to start on their road into spelling & sounding out words. My kids love the catchy songs that word world had.,1385510400,,145,3.8666666666666667
2881340,5,B000S5NV62,My daughter loves these videos and they are educational. Bonus! :0) Not sure if this is like other word world videos but they do have a lot of shows which if I'm not carefully to turn off or switch she'll zone out a bit. But overall these a great entertainment/ teaching devices.,1314921600,,279,4.384615384615385
2881341,5,B000S5NV62,I love my son loving this cartoon because I love it too!  His favorite character is dog.  This is the first DVD that we bought him and he still loves it and watches it over and over and over.  And I am glad too that my son loves watching something that is educational as well.,1298764800,,276,3.981818181818182
2881342,5,B000S5NV62,"Our daughter has been watching Word World since she was 18 months old. She absolutely LOVES it!! We bought this DVD for her in January of this year and she asks to watch it often. She often talks about the stories + characters with us, for many hours after the DVD is over. We highly recommend Word World for all parents, no scary adventures, just pure fun and problem solving with words+letters. We plan on buying the DVD collection of Word World shortly.",1276560000,,456,4.506024096385542
2881343,5,B000S5NV62,"The plot is nice and funny, the goal is perfect - to teach children read and spell correctly. Wonderful idea fro bilingual children. My toddler ia watching it with smile on his face and starts repeating the words, even though he is not english speaking child.
I would strongly recommend!",1260403200,,287,4.76
2881344,5,B000S5NV62,"My son just turned 3, and this is a perfect DVD for us to sit down and watch together.  The characters are cute, the songs are fun, and best of all, it's educational in such a way that we can laugh and play while working on his words.  Highly recommended!",1258329600,,255,4.08
2881345,5,B000S5NV62,"My 8 month old daughter loves this show! She claps and dances to the music and is just fascinated with it. We are collecting all of the characters right now for her - she loves to pull them apart and then stick them back together. They are great learning tools ... we use them to point out letters, the sounds they make, the sounds they make when they come together and then the word itself! A great association tool.",1237507200,,417,4.291139240506329
2881346,5,B000S5NV62,"My kids (7,4,2) all love this movie.  It's super cute and very clever.  It teaches good values as well as pre-reading skills.  I also recommend their website for kids at pbskids.

2881348,5,B000S5NV62,"This is one of the best shows I've seen come out in a long time!  It's fun, cute and educational.  My children really love this show and never seem to get tired of watching it.  My children have started to recognize the words and are spelling them out along with the show...it's wonderful!  I plan to buy them all!",1212364800,,314,4.271186440677966
2881349,5,B000S5NV62,"The DVD's from Word World are absolutely entertaining and full of learning. My 3 year old daughter absolutely loves these DVD's and she is learning her letters and their sounds. She can even identify certain words like dog, duck, and frog. Of course, her favorite characters, but still for just turning 3 I am quite impressed. I highly recommend these DVD's for any toddler.",1211155200,,374,4.859375
2881350,5,B000S5NV62,"This is the greatest kid's show of all time (and my daughter has forced me into watching quite a few!)  I credit this show (with some added support from SuperWhy) with teaching her how to spell using visual cues - imagine my surprise when my barely-two year old girl looked at me with supreme confidence and spelled words such as ""guitar"" and ""rocket"" perfectly.  She now spells out virtually every word she sees, thanks to the clever presentation of WordWorld.  Can't recommend it highly enough.  All I can say is ""Make more DVD's!!""",1205971200,,534,4.709677419354839
2881351,5,B000S5NV62,This is the best program PBS has had in it's programming schedule!  My kids are learning to spell and being entertained at the same time.  They ask for wordworld all the time!  The ability to visualize the letters of an object in the graphical depiction is brilliant!  I highly suggest it for children who are exploring letters and beginning to put them together to make words.  EXCELLENT!,1205280000,,389,4.746268656716418
2881352,5,B000S5NV62,"I agree with the other reviewers. Word World is a show that parents can enjoy with their children without going batty. The music is catchy, the subjects of each episode are interesting. My 3 year old learned how to spell stop & several other words after seeing this show only a few times. Yes, he is only memorizing at this point, but it's a start.
***Only one negative here....this DVD is 3 TV episodes. You can DVR this at home if you get PBS. I almost bought this thinking it was a 60min movie, but I see now it is only episodes that we already have on DVR. I won't waste my money. Glad I noticed. Buy it if you don't have a DVR. Great shows",1204761600,5,644,4.119047619047619
2881353,5,B000S5NV62,This is an amazing teaching tool!  It has taught my son so much and he absolutely LOVES the movie!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  Amazon has the BEST PRICE!,1203638400,,147,4.576923076923077
2881354,5,B000S5NV62,"This is a wonderful product, my kids watch it all the time. It comes on PBS and I have all the episodes saved to my cable box. I was so happy when I saw both DVD's at my local Kroger for $9.99.",1203120000,,193,3.619047619047619
2881355,5,B000S5NV62,"The ""Word World"" PBS serious is wonderful and quite educational.  My children ages 3 and 16 months really enjoy it.  My 16 month old son hardly puts two words together ever, but when I ask the children if they want to watch Word World, he responds ""Word World"".  He loves it. The characters in the series are fun and colorful.  The story lines are fun and educational.  Educational concepts are reinforced appropriately.
Because of this series, my 3 year old daughter loves to ""build words"" with foam letters that we have.

Another PBS series that is fabulous and entertaining is ""Super Why"".  Both my children can't get enough of it either.  I wish that the ""Super Why"" episodes would come to DVD also.  ""Super Why"" not only helps children spell words, but recognize letters and learn the alphabet.  The music they use is quite catchy too.

The Leapfrog Educational DVD 5 pack is also are extremely educational.  I've reviewed them too.

We view less than 2 hours of TV a day and ""Super Why"", ""Word World"" and the Leapfrog DVDs are a few of our limited viewing choices.

Because of these shows, plus some home schooling, my 3 year-old reads at a Kindergarten level and my 16  month old son knows his beginning phonics, so I highly recommend all of the above.",1202515200,,1259,4.608108108108108
2881356,5,B000S5NV62,"My 2 year old discoverd this show on his own while playing with the tv remote.  I am so glad he did.  This is the most captivating educational video that has come along in a long time.  Some shows try too hard to be ""educational.""  With very little effort this one accomplishes the goal. Your child will be building words and singing the little tunes with the best of them.  My son really loves this video.",1202428800,2,406,4.2894736842105265
2881357,4,B000S5NV62,"My preschooler cant get enough of this!!  The content is great, good stories,educational, bright, funny!

2881358,5,B000S5NV62,I couldn't wait to get Word World DVDs.  It's one of the few shows (along with SuperWhy) that I would rate as equal to CBeebies on BBC.  Both Word World and Super Why are simultaneously fun and educational and have excellent animation.,1201737600,,235,4.571428571428571

This one in particular was a big hit for my two boys who are crazy about space!  It's great for my 7 yr old who has spelling tests now, to see the letters turn into words and my 4 yr old who is learning his letter sounds to help him put the letters together to form a word. Very educational with cute graphics and child appropriate humor. Highly recommend this for educational TV programming/dvd.",1399593600,,574,4.017543859649122
8204328,5,B000S5NV62,"We love the Word World series.  We don't have cable tv so it is nice to have an option to buy episodes and play them again and again.  They have helped my kindergartener to read and spell while still in preschool.  Both our boys have autism and being very literal, my older son took magnetic letters on a cookie sheet, spelled a word, pushed them together and expected them to turn into the object like in the movie.  Cute.  We had to explain the difference between fantasy in movies and stories and real life which provided another great teaching moment.  The Word World series has also provided great social skills teaching as the animals in word world interact with each other.  In one episode ant and pig, who are best friends, have a disagreement.  In another episode, dog struggles to communicate with the other word friends who all think they know what he is saying.  In another episode, one of the word friends loses their home and another takes him in.  The ""homeless"" friend tries to show the hospitable friend he is grateful but ends up irritating the hospitable friend because of their different likes and dislikes.  In the end they talk to each other and realize it was a misunderstanding and they both really care for each other - and the ""homeless"" friend gets his house rebuilt thanks to other word friends.",1395187200,,1323,4.635193133047211
