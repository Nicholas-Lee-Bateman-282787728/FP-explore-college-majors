8666729,5,B00LMPYA6M,"Congratulations. I just finished the Survival Hunting course. It is an
excellent primer for hunters. I appreciated the completeness and
simplicity of the instructor's approach to the subjects. I plan to
refer back to the course in the future. Do you plan to release a DVD
for those of us who would like to have it for reference? (I have a
laptop in my EMP box).
I was referred to this site on Amazon.",1415664000,,400,4.418918918918919
8666730,5,B00LMPYA6M,"Great all-around hunting resource for beginner hunters like me. This product is well made, thorough and very detailed. And I especially appreciated the detailed shots of the various animal processing (gutting, skinning, butchering etc) which was something that intimidated me. The guy actually makes it look very easy. While it does cover a good number of animals (the birds section is especially good if you want to learn about plucking, breasting etc), I wish it had stuff on hogs although I get that it probably isn't much different than what he shows with deer.",1404777600,,565,5.0212765957446805
