6988940,5,B00SJFV6U6,"this is a must have for any 3d lover, its beautiful,so peacefull and so real,probably my favorite out of my collection of 75 3d shows.",1435708800,2,134,4.4
6988941,5,B00SJFV6U6,"Anyone who doubts the impact possible for 3D cinematography must purchase this film... I love and own many 3D films but this would be number one to make anyone a devotee... You will be so mesmerized by the images you'll forget you're wearing glasses or the fact you might not give a damn about birds... Whenever I hear tekkies put down 3D I'm sure they haven't seen ""Wings 3D""
I implore anyone who has the equipment to view BluRay 3D  properly buy this BBC
film immediately...",1432944000,5,476,4.534883720930233
6988942,5,B00SJFV6U6,"WINGS 3D is one of the best of all the Nature Lover's movies I added to my vast/comprehensive library.  The super slow motion takes place following the real time footage allowing you to see the dynamic forces produced when an Osprey plunges in to capture prey.  In real-time the Osprey diving in at 50 mph, like a missile penetrating the water, with wings spread would be too fast to see in detail, but when slowed down you watch the Osprey pop up, shakes the water off, starts to flap the wings and takes off with fish in tow.

The camera flies along side the birds and in some sequences the camera is mounted on the actual bird itself capturing flight from the birds perspective.  Ultra-lite air powered flying aircraft fly next to the birds which makes you feel as though you are actually there.

I can't say more as to the superb camera work invested to create a magnificent movie and to top everything off the movie is in 3D.  This type of movie could be viewed several times without getting bored and without the feelings of, ""I have already seen it.""  I have already watched the movie 2 times and tonight will be the 3rd.  The first two viewings looked as though I was watching two movies and I expect to see more of what I missed the prior two times.  What you miss the first time around you will see the 2nd time and even if you don't the raw splendor is worth repeated viewing.

Wings 3D is an absolute ""KEEPER"" and will add an excellent, if not the best, movie to your collection.  If this is your first purchase, I warn you; you might become spoiled.  This movie will be difficult to top.

Enjoy!",1432512000,13,1608,4.373737373737374
6988943,5,B00SJFV6U6,Product arrived on time and as described.,1429920000,,41,5.0
6988944,5,B00SJFV6U6,"WINGS 3D is characterized by amazing photography, including telephoto shots, aerial views and, most amazing of all, aerial tracking shots, in which the photographer, in a special light-weight helicopter-type device, follows right along with soaring birds. There are even bird-mounted cameras that show you what flying is like from a birds eye view.

Many varieties of birds are depicted, including pelicans, snow geese, cranes, gannets, starlings, falcons, and bald eagles. Seldom have I seen these birds so close and so clearly. We see a flock of snow geese making its 1500-mile annual migration, ospreys dive bombing into a school of sardines, and assorted sea creatures.

Arctic whales breaching are a highlight. There are also scenes of devil rays practically flying up out of the ocean (no one knows for sure why they do this, but the thinking is it has to do with rounding up smaller fish). Dolphins and birds have a symbiotic relationship as the dolphins stir up the water, driving small fish to the surface, making it possible for them to be eaten by swooping birds.

As the birds make their journey, we see picturesque views of Monument Valley, Arizona, Midwest farmland, and the New York City skyline. Included are some neat helicopter shots of the Statue of Liberty.

The low-key narration is just right  not overly pedantic. Its just enough to explain some of the creature behavior captured by the camera. As in the TINY GIANTS 3D Blu-ray, this film features pristine photography. If youve seen Winged Migration, you will recognize some of the filming techniques. Certainly, this is a state-of-the-art nature film.

Both Blu-ray 3D and regular Blu-ray versions are included on a single disc.",1428624000,18,1703,5.086021505376344
6988945,5,B00SJFV6U6,"I love watching nature films of all sorts and have peered into the pages of many nonfiction books about birds.  Books don't provide the excitement I feel when one perches outside my window or a pair of doves sit on the peak of my barn.  Wings 3D, however presents breathless, unforgettable journey with birds I won't forget anytime soon as I soared through the skies with them.

Ive read a lot about the six-long journey to create this story, how the beginnings didn't even start in HD.  In fact the technology that launched the journey was 35mm.  The completed work is absolutely stunning (and a bit scary for those afraid of heights) and well worth taking a look at.  Just what do these birds see as they soar above us?  I was able to soar with the to dizzying heights from the Grand Canyon and fly with them as they migrated.

It doesnt matter if you are a natural history buff, are a birder, or don't even care for birds because youll love this fascinating journey above us.  Im not a birder, but this film certainly could make me into one now that I can see what they see.  Its a beautifully well-executed film thats perfect not just for someone who wants to learn something, but for anyone who wants to soar through the skies. The film can also be played in 2D, but not on any DVD player.

6988966,5,B00SJFV6U6,one of the best 3d movies ever made. thanks for the super effort!!,1488499200,,66,4.153846153846154
6988967,4,B00SJFV6U6,Very good 3D though some scenes made 3D hard to watch. Example when there was a huge flock of birds 3D didn't work to well. Also the scene with the killer whale killing the sea lion. Was not needed especially with children watching was to intense for little minds. Over all is worth adding to my collection I don't regret getting it.,1487116800,,333,4.387096774193548
6988968,5,B00SJFV6U6,Great 3 D scenes and really good quality. One of the most enjoyable 3D videos I have ever seen.,1486425600,,95,4.052631578947368
6988969,2,B00SJFV6U6,"This seemed like a slow movie talking more about birds.  I was hoping for a little more movement and action than storyline.  I was hoping for an experience like IMAX where you feel like you are soaring around, but this was a little boring.  I won't watch it a second time.",1486252800,,272,4.294117647058823
6988970,5,B00SJFV6U6,"Amazing! I purchased this for my wife as a Christmas gift, thinking it was a documentary mainly about lions. It is SO much more. We both agreed after watching it that this is probably the best nature documentary we have ever seen... save for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-Earth/dp/B000SKNIWE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet Earth</a>. The team behind the Enchanted Kingdom took on so many crazy challenges and broke so much new ground in 3D/HD nature photography that we couldn't wait to watch the special features just to see how many of these stunning shots were accomplished. A good example is an HD shot tracking up to and OVER&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Victoria-Falls/dp/B002LFAHFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Victoria Falls</a>. After seeing how the shot was accomplished, it was even more amazing to watch.

The separate segments are stitched together very well and the flow of the overall documentary is perfect. The final touch of quality for this film was the narration by Idris Elba. He is a fantastic narrator, delivering emotion and urgency to the images. He's almost as good as David Attenborough... ALMOST. :)

If you are a fan of Planet Earth or just of nature documentaries in general, this is a must watch. The 3D presentation is outstanding but it's just as wonderful in 2D/HD. The images are eye-popping and the animals and environments shown are just truly awe inspiring.",1486252800,,1494,5.8173515981735155

6988972,5,B00SJFV6U6,Some of the very best nature footage and very best image quality combined with tremendous 3D. BBC Earth nailed it. Dolby Atmos soundtrack too?  This is a must have as a demo disc for 3D.  Also check out Tiny Giants,1481932800,,214,4.325
6988973,5,B00SJFV6U6,"Great job by BBC capturing birds in their incredibly long yearly migratory journeys.  There are a couple of spots that might unsettle children or squeamish people that involves predatory scenes.  But it is, after all, nature taking its course which can't be shied away from.  Highly recommend.",1481500800,,293,5.191489361702128
6988974,3,B00SJFV6U6,"I was anxious to see this blu-ray 3D because of the subject matter. A little longer than a lot of nature documentaries (close to 90 min.), it could have been a great 3D experience, except for all of the ""ghosting"" throughout the film. That was VERY distracting, and disappointing. Don't know what could have been done in production, but they definitely dropped the ball on the 3D technology.",1481328000,,391,4.764705882352941

6988991,5,B00SJFV6U6,We bought this as an extra along with David Attenborough DVDs and wondered if it would be up to their quality. It certainly was. We have quite a few wild life DVDs on birds and this must rate as one of the very best. The slow-mo shots of birds moving in 3D are astonishing and the technical quality is very high.,1476316800,,312,4.131147540983607
6988992,5,B00SJFV6U6,"This is by far the best nature cinema photography production I've ever seen, and I own all of BBC's Planet Earth. I caught this film twice on pay TV before finding it on Amazon in 3D. The 1080P 3D on a 10ft screen is simply amazing, jaw dropping footage. Using drones and GoPros I assume they take you right off the edge of a giant waterfall. This movie makes me appreciate ALL forms of life on this tiny blue planet we call earth.

6989012,3,B00SJFV6U6,"Pros...the photography and locations are exceptional.
Cons...some of the chapters were a little drawn out, overall the movie is a little slow paced. I watched this on an LG 3D and the 3D effect was less than amazing. If you want amazing 3d watch Wings.
Also, the special features were mostly about how difficult it was to get the 3D camera equipment on location and into position, please, no more whining BBC.",1467072000,,409,4.694444444444445

In order to truly appreciate this high level of expertise I strongly urge you to watch special features that demonstrates  the inner workings of this kind of a production ....interviews with the director and producers and some of the other is involved is very enlightening  showing the many challenges including extreme weather and treacherous terrain .... While this genre of film is not always my first choice this is got to be the one exception if you can only buy one 3-D DVD I am positive you will not regret the purchase of Enchanted Kingdom ...another companion piece which Is Wings... Must have!!!!!  You won't be sorry......",1460332800,2,823,5.0814814814814815
6989040,1,B00SJFV6U6,if there were more stars I would give them. li would recommend this 3d to everyone who has a 3d tv. its amazing how they could film inside an ocean wave. lt looks like  a tunnel. another thing I really like is the singing. it is really beautiful. this was my original review but now I have to change it to one star and that is reluctantly. it was great the  first 2 times I played it but now when I try to play it the 3 previews of other dvds play and then my tv says no signal for current input device try another imput.. I use the hdmi porft for all the dvds and this is the only one that does this. both the 3d dvds do this so I wonder if anyone else has this problem. its no good if it won't play after 2 times..,1459123200,,716,3.7986577181208054
6989041,4,B00SJFV6U6,"The actual video is 5 stars plus. The beginning and end of the film has a little girl in a big city jumping around in water for some strange reason. I can only think she is the granddaughter of someone important on the film. The narration script is a little weird, and doesn't give much information, like the location of most of the segments. I had to suffer through lots of logos at the beginning and end of each Behind the Scenes segment bonus material to get the locations. And the narration is a little over the top in a few places. But the main video often takes place in a number of rarely seen, visually stunning, places. The 3D is amazing, and really adds to the experience.",1459123200,,682,4.3359375

6989060,4,B00SJFV6U6,"Wings is a  breath-taking 3D movie, a demo-quality one that shows 3D at its best. It loses a star my opinion because of the scene of the great white sharks eating the seals - not a necessary scene in a documentary on birds, and seems over-long and repetitive.. I think the producers wanted to appeal to a public that likes this sort of thing and would buy it just for that. Also, this scene has already been shown in Planet Earth, which was full of scenes of animals eating animals. That is a fact of life, as we all know. I have had five cats that were all hunters. But it is out place and possibly distressing to children who think seals are cute animals who should not be eaten, especially so violently. So I sold this one, as I sold Planet Earth reluctantly.",1454371200,5,762,4.291666666666667

It includes horses, bears, seals, sharks, salmon, trout, etc.  They travel the globe with so many birds and they teach you fascinating facts. Tthe DVD also includes wonderful underwater footage.  The 3D itself is stunning and they show you at the end of the movie how they captured some of the fantastic footage.  It almost looks like the bald eagle in the movie has a go-pro camera strapped to it.  They used a small helicopter to follow birds and also drones to capture footage that I have never seen before.  One of the best 3D movies I own.  Another plus is it's almost 1 1/2 hours long!  Great for the whole family!",1450310400,,690,4.428571428571429

I watched it in 3D on a 140"" screen and it was breathtaking. The Atmos sound track was the best I have heard. The overhead speakers are being used very effectively. Effects like rain, raging rivers, are done so effectively that they make you you feel you are right there.
The content itself is pretty impressive as well. You get to see the lives of animals in the African continent fairly closely as if you are right there with them without leaving the comfort of your home.
I normally don't get excited about documentaries but this one is highly recommended.

6989128,4,B00SJFV6U6,"(Note: Enchanted Kingdom comes on 2 discs -- the first is a 3D+2D Blu-Ray combo disc, the 2nd is a DVD).

Seeing all of the positive reviews, I had to check this one out. I'm a big fan of 3D content and nature documentaries (such as Planet Earth).

The film runs about 90 minutes (roughly double the typical Imax 3D documentary) and includes a directors commentary and almost an hour of behind the scenes features (2D). Video is presented in 1.85:1, Dolby Atmos audio and English subtitles (optional).

I found the 3D to be overall very good. Watching on a Panasonic 3D LED TV, I didn't experience ANY crosstalk throughout. I believe part of this is due to CGI being used to enhance scenes. Some of these scenes seemed impossible to shoot in the circumstances they're presented (especially seeing the size of the equipment being used in the behind the scenes). The content appeared to be a mix of Real 3D, converted 3D and some CGI. Fortunately, it was high quality and blended nicely -- it also helped eliminate some of the standard 3D problems such as crosstalk. As such though, some scenes seemed very ""in your face"" popping out of the screen and extending deep into it, while others seemed much more flat.

Video quality also varied a bit throughout. While some scenes were incredibly sharp, used techniques such as Macro photography, slow-motion, timelapse and color-grading, other scenes seemed a bit ""flat"" and un-graded, giving a noticeable shift in difference throughout. Definitely expected, considering the variety of locations being covered, but I did find it to be noticeable. Overall, still very good throughout.

Audio is available in Dolby Atmos. I don't have an Atmos receiver and watched it through a soundbad which also sounded very nice. Some nice subwoofer effects and a fitting soundtrack. My one complaint with the audio were that the over-dubbed sound effects did come off as a bit ""too much"" at times, adding eating sound effects to underwater animals, and I believe I even heard a car horn at some point when showing a group of fish swimming.

The content itself was good. My one complaint was that it jumped around so much without really giving you any new facts. I found that watching it, most of the information given was either basic knowledge (Flamingos turn pink because of what they eat) or was just filler-dialog to talk over scenes. I found that the content was probably more suited for a younger audience than for someone looking for a ""documentary"". With it skipping around every few minutes (from elephants to barracuda to monkeys and then crocodiles), it seemed like it was trying to cram too much content into too short of a time, and in doing so left out a lot of content.

Overall, I did enjoy it. The 3D was very nice and it was an entertaining film. I just didn't find it to ""hook me"" as much as something like Planet Earth did.",1449100800,3,2872,4.732
6989129,5,B00SJFV6U6,"Unbelievable footage.  The 3D experience really made this pop. There were a few scenes that took advantage of Dolby Atmos which really enhanced the listening experience.  The 3D was well done - definitely gave the movie a real life dimension.  There was a scene towards the end where the elephant's trunk came right out of the screen towards us.  Any 3D movie that can amaze my 4 year old and make her giggle and laugh that hard at some of the 3D effects deserves 5 stars :).

This is definitely a very high quality produced film. Highly recommend. My only complaint is that I wish it was longer.

The special features does an excellent job at illustrating how they made this film. Very impressive!",1448668800,5,698,4.588709677419355

CINEMATOGRAPHY
-Abundant use of slow-motion and time-lapse photography are the highlights. Slow-mo just makes everything look cool. Time-lapse makes plants' behavior look animal-like.
-Picture quality is fantastic. Close-up shots of animals get you closer than if they were actually in your living room. You can see every hair on the monkey and every ripple of the lizard's skin.
-Aerial wide-angle scenes are remarkable. If you ever wanted to peer over the edge of a massive waterfall, this is your chance.

CONTENT
-If you've seen a lot of nature shows, there isn't anything new or ground-breaking from a content standpoint.
-Since this is a single film, you are getting a general overview of Africa. Don't expect in-depth introspection like you would with a multi-part series like Planet Earth.
-The movie will relax you with beautiful scenes much more than it will thrill you with action.
-Most everything is PG in content. This is generally a happy film with minimal graphic kills.
-Minimal phony drama or staged scenes. Unlike most nature shows on TV these days, BBC Earth generally avoids this contrivance.

3D
-Excellent use of 3D in a natural way. It adds a lot of depth to the vast mountain shots. The underwater coral reef scenes allow you to see fish at multiple different depth levels. Monkey faces look amazingly life-like with the added depth.
-The 3D is not in-your-face, gimmicky, or artificial-looking.

ATMOS
-The sonic bubble is certainly present and adds to the feeling of ""being there"". Insect sounds are all around you. Sounds will pan from side-to-side or back-to-front frequently.
-There are a few moments of distinct overhead noise (like thunder). Don't expect a constant barrage though.

SOUNDTRACK
-The mostly African-themed music (think Lion King) is fantastic and adds much grandeur and spectacle to all the scenes. It's one of the special aspects of this film that set it apart from most nature movies.
-The narration complements the movie very well without being overbearing.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROPAGANDA
-None included. Thank you BBC for not making me or my audience feel guilty to be a human like so many nature shows tend to do these days.
-The only message at the end is to appreciate all the spectacular nature around you wherever you are. Very nice.

CONCLUSION
BBC Earth produces another spectacular nature film while avoiding the annoyances present in many other nature shows. While there is nothing groundbreaking in the content, the extensive use of time-lapse and slow-mo coupled with an excellent soundtrack elevates each scene. What makes this film uniquely special is that it is fabulously presented in Atmos and 3D.",1448582400,10,3350,5.852459016393443
6989131,1,B00SJFV6U6,"This is a two disc set. The DVD plays fine and is beautiful. The same content is on the Blu-ray but it is in 3D and is truly stunning! But BBC has a problem with production. None of the bonus material (and there is a lot of it) on the Blu-ray disc plays,...NONE!!!. Not only that, but when I try to access that bonus material, my Blu-ray player (SONY 3D Blu-ray) stops responding to its remote. Even the buttons on the Blu-ray player itself become non-functional. The only way I can stop the disc and open the access door is to pull the plug on the Blu-ray player, and then plug it in again. I've never had this problem with any non BBC disc. I tried testing that Blu-ray 3D disc a few times and even changed the batteries in the Blu-ray player's remote unit, but to no avail. Amazon sent a replacement copy but it had the exact same problems!

I had a similar problem with a  4 disc BBC nature series on Blu-ray 3D, David Attenborough's ""The 3D Collection""  that I also purchased through Amazon. On each of the 3 main discs, the bonus features were inaccessible, although the main 3D programs segments did play perfectly. There was also a separate Blu-ray 3D disc of just bonus material and that disc wouldn't play at all! Others had indicated encountering a similar problem in their reviews.

I originally gave the ""Enchanted Kingdom"" set a 4 star rating because what is view-able is so extraordinary, but be prepared to be very disappointed and annoyed by the problems I encountered. After getting another defective replacement set from Amazon I had to lower my rating to one star, solely due to BBC's very poor quality control or just lack of concern for manufacturing 3D Blu-ray discs that will play properly in the US.

12/25/15 update,...I have now tried three different copies of the Enchanted Kingdom 3D bluray disc, both on my euipment and on a neighbors 3D TV, and sadly have found the same disappointing results,...on the 3D bluray discs, the bonus features are inaccessible and when one does try to play them the remote control for the bluray player and the buttons on that player all become non-functional. The disc is then locked inside the player. The only way to remove it is to remove the electrical plug from the wall outlet and then reinsert it. Once done, one can now open the disc draw for removal of the disc.  Amazon sent a replacement copy for me to test, and after that didn't work, I complained to BBC, who also sent a replacement copy, which also didn't work. That's three defective discs out of three!!!",1448582400,16,2532,4.566079295154185

This is about the true 3D BluRay of Wings 3D.  It is simply astounding.  As one reviewer stated, the commentary was not overbearing and just enough to explain what is happening.  The videography is breathtaking.  With all the camera angles and all the cameras used, i would love to look at their cutting room floor.  All filmed in 3D and it shows.  The clarity is second to none and with your 3D glasses on, you are flying with all the birds.  This is some of the best 3D out there.  The depth, quality and detail is what makes this movie.  I don't remember any pop outs that come out of the screen and if there were, it was not as memorable as the feeling of 'being there'.  I love 3D where things sort of pop out of the screen for you to want to grab it.  This movie though is real with no special effects, no special wow factors, just true nature, flying high in beautiful backdrops.

If you like other BBC Nature series discs, this is a must to have.  The 3D is breathtaking and you will not be disappointed.",1446076800,8,1277,4.2803347280334725

This is the next close documentary in IMAX format but IMAX is usually only 45 minutes where this documentary happens to be for 90 minutes. The cinematography, music, directing, narration by Idris Elba is done so superbly that it becomes more than a nature documentary (although I miss David Attenborough. It becomes an action movie starring the creations of the Universe, the Blue Planet creatures and the forceful elements from wind to sun, rain, oceans, seas, sand dooms, volcanoes, alien islands, frozen spires, valleys, animals, bugs, . Absolutely and positively an unbelievable experience in 3D by the best of the best. An entertaining nature documentary unlike any. Escape the ordinary and witness the other side of extraordinary in 3D. This is such a superb production that you can even use the film as a screen saver for your TV without the sound at all.

By far, I think that this is the best 3D ever after Avatar. 3D is available for us to travel all around Africa, enables us to watch animals as closer as possible, even 3D makes us to feel an illusion of the reality.
I recommend you to watch with 3D glasses that will help you to bring into Africa. After the whole show is gone, I felt like I have gone to Africa. It was tremendous experience and worth for watching it two more.

It might be rather bothersome for younger children, but it is nature.

The difference with the enchanted kingdom is that you are starting with magnificent cinematography and mesmerizing subject matter, but now the addition is the stereoscopic photography.  From the very first scene where you are literally drop into the forest floor from the treetop canopy down to the ground via the 3D camera rig, you are immediately IN the forest in a way that no 2D film has ever given us.  I have shown this to friends and family and everyone from 10yr olds to teens (who I was sure would become bored what with no car chases or explosions) to their parents and grandparents, EVERYONE to a person couldn't stop talking about how much they loved this movie.  Believe me, it is a must for anyone who has 3D capability.  This will be the movie that everyone you show it too will thank you and energetically discuss it long afterward.  It is a film that is spectacularly visually and sumptuous in a way that only Mother Nature can give.  Short of going on a safari (and even if you did, you wouldn't get to see the animal kingdom in so much diversity and with such incredible intimacy).

All of that being said,  you will used this BluRay to show off the incredible immersiveness of the 3D technology; you will pull it out very time you want to WOW your friends with how incredible 3D really is when done well.  BTW, this is NOT a  computerized 3D ""conversion;"" it is shot with a two camera rig.  There is a great Making Of as an extra that give you some idea of how difficult it was to get these magnificent shots lugging the doubly heavy 3d camera rig thru the jungle!  The industry may totally abandon the 3D format at some point -- if you have 3D equipment, don't let this movie get away...it will be one that you will he happy you have in your library in the future.",1534118400,,1895,4.457971014492753

8698577,3,B00SJFV6U6,This is a review of the 3-D version. There are some truly amazing shots that are just awe-inspiring. Unfortunately there is a lot of cross-talk. Literally every other scene produces extreme distortion. While the ones in focus are incredible the next scene will blur. I've adjusted the settings on my TV to eliminate the cross talk on specific scenes but then the previous scene that was perfect before the adjustment would suffer from cross-talk so the 3-D experience is muddled overall. This was very disappointing because all the footage is beautiful but the production suffers which takes away from the overall experience. In 2-D this wouldn't be an issue so I'm sure the entire film is breathtaking.,1504656000,,703,5.017094017094017

Problem with this one is they tried to pop every damn bird out of the screen so what you have is terrible looking birds up front with a REALLY FLAT BACKDROP.  It's just not good at all.

Before you go and blame my projector or setup - I have a real theater room in my house - new 3D Sony projector - new screen - and $10k in audio gear.  Black sound deadening walls, controlled lighting, blacked out windows, HT seating, you get the point == a real theater room.

Everything I have watched in 3D has been from jaw dropping to still good.  Everest, Hansel & Grettle Witch Hunters, Jurrasic Parks, IMax the Ultimate Wave, Gravity ==> all examples of really great 3D.  Life of PI was on the edge of ONLY OK because they did close to the same as this -
 it's zoomed to close so it's unrealistic and weird looking.  Even then PI was still an ok watch.

THIS JUST PLAIN SUCKS IN 3D!  It's so bad I fast forwarded then turned off after 10 minutes.  I couldn't take any more.  I have no idea what the good reviewers were watching - it was definitely not what I saw.",1500508800,,1205,4.178260869565217

The BBC has been a longstanding leader in the field of eye-catching nature documentaries and ENCHANTED KINGDOM 3D is the latest addition to the British broadcaster professional output.

ENCHANTED KINGDOM 3D nature is more magical, more enchanting, and more powerful than anything you can possibly imagine. And no other continent inspires the imagination like Africa and the wildest place on Earth, a place of mysterious landscapes, awesome drama and a beguiling cast of characters. Some are fantastical, others are alien; all are mesmerizing. Filmed with ground-breaking new 3D technology, ENCHANTED KINGDOM 3D provides a never-before-seen perspective of the continent, immersing us in a way that has never been done before. Join an epic quest and be swept along on a thrilling journey to discover the wonderful power of a magical place, in natures most ENCHANTED KINGDOM 3D  and was shot over a mammoth 500 days, this is the most ambitious and spectacular wildlife film EVER from the worlds most trusted natural history brand BBC Earth Films.

The documentary takes the viewer with the clouds to Africa, to the continent par excellence where nature has free rein, and all aspects are covered, where the nature, wildlife and the elements from rainforest to desert, of a forest ants to elephants, and the merciless heat to icy cold landscapes. The 3D effect enhances the hyper-realistic image. Thus ENCHANTED KINGDOM 3D  looks impressive, especially travelling through seven distinct realms in the wildest continent on Earth, to discover that nature is so much more surprising and extraordinary than you could ever have imagined. It is as enchanting as any fictional world or storybook. In each realm, we experience just how different and astounding nature can be, and encounter extraordinary animal characters, who reveal amazing lessons about the world.

We are plunged into nature at its most generous and most harsh, most terrible and most beautiful. We explore an enchanted land where nature weaves its incredible magic, finally transforming into an abundant paradise, where life is at its most joyful. It is a thrilling, immersive journey where you will experience the wonders of our planet as never before. An experience so alive that youll feel you're really there, in the heart of the wild. Let yourself be swept back into nature and leave your urban life behind. You will never look at nature, or your own world, the same way again.

ENCHANTED KINGDOM 3D shows off the ground-breaking BBC Earth Films, and the creator of the Walking with Dinosaurs 3D and Earth, takes us on a spell-binding journey through seven realms of Africa to reveal a natural world stranger, more magical, and more mystical than anything we might imagine. The film flows likes a stream, with extraordinary time-lapse photography, sweeping aerial shots, and macro and micro lensed 3D propelling us from enchanted forests to the boiling edge of the underworld, from celestial ice-capped mountains and lava-spewing volcanoes, to crashing waterfalls and deep fantastical seas, as we experience some of the greatest gatherings of wildlife ever captured on film. With up-close-and-personal animal encounters and absolutely stunning scenery, this is an unspeakably beautiful film that presents nature in all her epic grandeur. But at one point we end up on this awesome fast moving rapids and we get thrown about in a very violent way and it is so very effective in 3D that you actually feel you are riding the violent rapids, but what we view is very short, so not enough time to get the sick bag out, that is how totally realistic it feels.

ENCHANTED KINGDOM 3D is one of the best documentary I have seen so far in 3D, and it BLOWS EVERYTHING OUT OF THE WATER and sitting there in awe of Africa's beauty for the entire duration of the movie, not once but TWICE being moved to tears at the complete amazement of natures creation. It's so diverse and breath-taking, taking you all the way from up top on Mount Kenya to the coral reefs near the continent's shore. With the added dimension, you honestly feel like you are actually there, with no screen in front of you. This feels very REAL and it is so refreshing to sit back and watch something tangible that has no need for multiple days of rendering with the most expensive computers around. Yet no matter how well it looks, a nature doc is nothing without sound and narration, and they knock both out of the park and narrator Idris Elba really enhances what you view on the screen. As to the music score it is PERFECT and really nails the humour, suspense, jubilation, and even sadness so well, but boy at one point in the documentary it creates an amazing jump scene or two for the viewers when the crocodile jumps out of the water to attack a wildebeest.

There is not much for story for ENCHANTED KINGDOM 3D and animals themselves provide plenty of entertainment and our senses are totally heightened with amusing musical choices that create laughter, suspense and thrills. For his part, Idris Elba is a terrific narrator and has a rich voice that is regal and smooth, while pushing the story along with spurts of funny one liners and insightful knowledge. If you enjoy nature documentaries than this is a must see, especially in 3D, but if you missed it when shown in the cinema, then this is the next best way to view this stunning documentary. The 3D adds so much depth to the screen that it often transports you to feeling as though you are exploring Africa yourself and especially the water scenes in particular are stunning utilising the best visual effects on offer.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Universal Pictures and BBC Earth Films together brings us a totally awesome 1080p encoded 3D image, with and equally impressive 1.85:1 aspect ratio. ENCHANTED KINGDOM 3D was shot in 3D using Red Epic and highly specialized Element Technica 3D cameras. The result is some totally stunning 3D 1080p imagery that looks very natural with beautiful stunning glorious colourful images, breath-taking depth of field, and very natural pop-out 3D effects. The standout scenes are the underwater segments and the violent volcano scenes with the lava filling up the screen, but the entire film is a wonder to watch in stunning natural 3D. That said, the 2D version, which of course is available on the same Blu-ray disc is no slouch and probably provides even richer colors and crisper detail, although you do lose the extra spectacular 3D dimensionality effects, which I personally preferred, still at least you have a choice for your personal viewing enjoyment. Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Universal Pictures and BBC Earth Films gives us a totally spectacular English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio. This surround mix is totally dynamic without being obtrusive or fatiguing. The awesome sound effects like crashing waves, birdsong and buzzing insects surround you and make you actually feel you are actually there in the natural world. Low end sounds are also extended nicely. But sadly sometimes when Idris Elba narrates, with some of the dramatic music you have a job to hear what he says, as he is very soft spoken.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Making of Featurettes: Here we get to view Ten stunning special features showcasing all the cutting-edge of the 3D technology used in the BBC Earth Films Blu-ray disc, but you only get to view it in 2D and lets you get to see how they captured the stunning imagery of ENCHANTED KINGDOM and which you get to view with the following:

Special Feature: Beneath the Waves [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [4:07] With this first special feature, we take an in-depth look at deep in the ocean and its exotic sea creatures off the coast of Egypt in the Red Sea and with the help of the crew from the BBC Earth Films unit and especially the camera crew using one of the rarest 3D camera systems in the world that weighs a colossal 120 kilograms and you see them delicately winching it carefully into the red Sea, as there are only 2 of these 3d cameras in existence, and are able to film up close and personal with all the hustle and bustle of all the sea creatures living among the massive coral reef and see bed in glorious 3D. We also get to see how very difficult it was to film in 3D in some very tight areas of the coral reef, especially with this really heavy and delicate 3D camera.

Special Feature: Hell on Earth [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [5:10] Here we take an in-depth look at the incredible barren landscape of the Dallol in Ethiopia, which is the hottest place on Earth, with average temperatures consistently hovering at around 35 degrees Celsius, and has been judged as to be the hottest inhabited place on the planet and releases chemical compounds like ferrous chloride and iron hydroxide within the springs, and gives off acrid sulphur fumes that smells like rotten eggs. We get to see Jeff Rios [Stereographer] at work filming this incredible landscape and has been named The Hell Hole of Creation and because of the extreme heat in the daytime, they can only film late in the evening and at first light. Because of the treacherous terrain a lot of the two and a half ton heavy equipment had to be carried to and from the location each time for filming. The location also had a heavy toll on the crew as they had to drink 8 litres of water every day and eventually they were glad to finish filming, as the sulphur was starting to erode the metal equipment and were ever so glad to get back to civilisation.

Special Feature: King of the Jungle [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [3:54] Here we take a look at the filming in the thick forest of Rwanda, where the film crew wanted to capture the enchanting moments of the mountain gorillas and again they had massive challenges of getting the heavy equipment deep into the heart of the rain forest and they had to hire a massive amount of African porters to help carry all of the massive amount of equipment used for setting up the filming. What was also difficult was that the gorillas moved about a lot and especially in very difficult locations, even with the African porters, everyone had to trek up to three to four days to find the gorillas and again with all of the massive heavy equipment it was very gruelling task, but of course with all of their efforts they were able to film some stunning magical moments, but sometimes things did not go to plan and they could not film shots they wanted of the gorillas and of course it led to a lot of frustrations, but of course despite this situation, their efforts were rewarded.

Special Feature: Mission Impossible [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [6:17] Here we get to see them preparing to film the white knuckle ride and also filming the largest curtain of falling water on Earth and also one of the greatest challenge that the director have ever encountered with the location of the Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe, where the full width of the Zambezi River plummets in a sheer vertical drop into a narrow gorge 100 meters deep. Here we get to see the crew setting up the shot with the special spider camera rig to suspend the 3D camera over the gorge which was a logistic nightmare as it was also a very dangerous task to perform, especially with the constant torrent of water and the unpredictable wild life, namely a very rogue elephant, and what they wanted to achieve had never been performed before, and we see some really tricky and dangerous manoeuvres, especially by a specialist professional rock climber Walter Burkhardt trying to abseil down the falls and it took a total of six days of hard graft before filming could be started and on the seventh day they finally get the shot they have been working so hard to get.

Special Feature: Mountain Crisis [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [6:34] With an ambitious film crew, with 94 cases of equipment, over a 100 porters and two and half ton of equipment, they had to climb four and half thousand meters above sea level, high up the slopes of Mount Kenya, which is the highest mountain in Kenya and the second-highest in Africa, after Kilimanjaro. Their objective was to fil some 3D time lap filming of images of the mountain as it transforms through its daily cycle from a summers day to a wintery night. Their biggest challenge was to keep the equipment operational and especially keeping the crew safe in the very harsh environment and especially monitoring health issues because of the very high latitude. Another problem they encountered they faced was the batteries were failing due to the very extreme cold climate. One particular shot they wanted to film was the curious plant for this region called a Cabbage Groundsel that has remarkable adaptions to the harsh cold environment. But other problems they encountered were the very changeable extreme weather conditions that nearly destroyed their camp site. Also another serious problem arose is that one of the crew got very serious altitude sickness and had to be flown out to a hospital, but later on recovered. But despite all the setbacks, they finally got down to some serious spectacular 3D time lap filming of all the elements of nature on this spectacular mountainous range.

Special Feature: Mountain Monkeys [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [3:39] On the very first shoot of the ENCHANTED KINGDOM 3D film. The crew went to the Semien Mountains in northern Ethiopia, north east of Gondar, are part of the Ethiopian Highlands. They are a World Heritage Site and include the Semien Mountains National Park. The mountains consist of plateaus separated by valleys and rising to pinnacles. The tallest peak is Ras Dashen (4,550 m); other notable heights include Mounts Biuat (4,437 m) and Kidis Yared (4,453 m). The BBC Earth Films crew wanted to film the wild Gelada Monkeys [Gelada Baboon] in their native habitat, which can only be found in the high altitude of the Ethiopian Highland mountainous range and love spending much of its time foraging in grasslands. Again the crew had to transport all of their 104 pieces of equipment and excess baggage up the 3,000 meters up onto the mountain top with only the crew and porters. The first priority was to get the Gelada Monkeys comfortable with the crew filming them, especially with all of the rigging and so at first they used a pretend camera, so the monkeys got used to when the crew actually filmed them and it took six days to set up before they started filming, but on the seventh day they finally did the filming. But despite all the logistic nightmare problems, they finally got to film some spectacular images of these very fine looking Gelada Monkeys.

Special Feature: Plummeting to Earth [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [4:57] here we find the crew deep within the African rain forest, and here they wanted to capture quite possible the most critical shoot of the entire film programme. The shoot plunges you deep into the heart of the African continent where the crew ventured deep into the Crystal Mountains National Park in Gambon, a country along the Atlantic coast of Central Africa, where they found a missive diversity of animal species and creatures they wanted to film, but they had to overcome some very serious humidity that caused numerous problems, where the average annual relative humidity is 84.1%, which of coursed caused serious extreme body perspiration and extreme muddy slopes to add to their problems, which you see in this special feature and on top of all that you also see how they coped with the difficult working conditions and especially the densely jungle conditions. On one particular filming experience, it took them two gruelling days to set up to film the high jungle canopy, and especially searching for the right tree, where they wanted us the viewer to get the experience of vertigo and the immersion of the jungle environment and eventually they finally got the first ever 3D cable dolly shot from the top of the rain forest canopy down to the forest floor which they finally achieved, just before a storm erupted and deluged them with torrential rain.

Special Feature: Walking with Giants [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [4:39] In the most ambitious 3D nature film, the crew wanted to immerse the audience into what it was like in the Elephants life, and to also make the audience part of the family. With the Elephant herd, the crew had to use vehicles to follow them in their trek to find water. But with their 30kg 3D camera, the logistics were causing a lot of technical and serious heat problems did not help, especially being in the heart in Zimbabwes Hwange National Park which is in the West of Zimbabwe. But what the crew wanted was smooth controllable shots of the Elephants, and the solution they came up with was a rig called a Bungee Camera Mounting Rig which is a light weight contraption suspended by gyroscopes. One amazing scene we get to see is the herd of Elephants drinking out of the camps swimming pool, which was not on the crews agenda, but despite this you see them doing just that and quite a very amusing moment in time. But when it came to the all-important 3D shoot, they abandoned the Bungee Camera Mounting Rig and went instead with the very professional Chapman 3G Compact 3-Axis Gyro Stabilized Head which eliminates unwanted camera Shake during fast or rough camera moves and is the same equipment used in the Hollywood Blockbuster films and gets a totally smooth shot in any rough terrain, which again was ideal when shooting the herd of Elephants seeking water. So all in all this was a really nice little feature.

Special Feature: Working at Extremes [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [6:39] After two and half years on filming the ENCHANTED KINGDOM 3D and the ground-breaking 3D film, where we find out about the crew have worked in some very extreme environments that Africa had to offer, and all to capture the magic of nature at its best. In Botswana Renee Godfrey [Producer/Director] experienced something horrible that will not be forgotten and that was being attacked by leeches, which is top of her list of fears, but you also see other people in the crew also being attacked profusely as well and looked like a really nasty experience. But for the crew of BBC Earth Films most toughest and wettest assignment was experiencing the White Water Rapids of the Zambezi River that eventually leads to the Victoria Falls and the crew when filming wanted the audience to experience what it was like to go down this river, so the crew had to film from an inflatable raft and with the 3D camera mounted on the front of the raft, they were able to immerse the viewer in natures greatest roller coaster ride, and although it was viewed in the special feature in 2D, you really feel what the crew experienced, but as I have already stated earlier, when you see it is 3D you get an even more enhanced feeling of travelling down the violent rapids, because the Zambezi River is the fourth-longest river in Africa, and is also the most powerful river in the world, and especially as there is no easy route down this river, and you get to see the problems from the back of the raft as the crew was filming and all of a sudden the raft over turns and again it showed how dangerous this river can be, and they had to work fast to make sure everyone was safe, especially in not getting swept away. But despite the danger, the crew got some very dramatic shots that they were determined to film. Other dramatic shots they wanted to film was in a helicopter and doing some really dangerous manoeuvres around Mount Kenya, especially the air is very thin and there are a lot of air turbulent, especially with winds that swirl around the mountain, but with the skilful flying by the helicopter pilot, they were able to film some spectacular images in that region. Another expert they had some help from to film some spectacular waves in South Africa was from Mike Stewart who is a nine-time World Champion bodyboarder and one of the early pioneers of the bodyboarding sport and the crew strapped the 3D camera to his surf board to film in slow motion the spectacular view of being inside these massive waves and really makes you feel you are actually experiencing what Mike Stewart was experiencing, and this filming was the last part of a two and a half years filming around the world, which has now been completed.

Special Feature: Filming Flamebirds [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [4:59] With this final spectacular special feature, the crew are found filming in Lake Begonia in Kenya where we find over a million Kenya Lesser Flamingos and every year they perform one of the mesmerising dance display on Earth, and here we see the crew make an endeavour to capture on film the spectacular event and is a way of really immersing the viewer especially in 3D the beautiful natural life of these spectacular Pink Flamingos. But one problem the crew encountered is that when they started to get close to these birds they got really spooked and tented to fly off and not return, so to keep then the birds in a calm state, they had to come up with loads of subtle tactics, especially with good camouflage. To get the best shots, they built a remote control customised surf board and housed in it was all kinds of electronic gizmos which cost $1,000 to build, but despite this, things went badly wrong as you get to witness as the propeller got clogged up, so in the end that had to resort to human power and here we get to see cameraman Mark Deeble who had to steer the camera himself under camouflage in very nasty filthy water, that had a content of 14.5ph value, meaning its content is extremely alkaline and irritant, but with Marks patience he was able to get within 6 meters of the Flamingos, but because the water was really dangerous to humans, they instead fitted up a camouflage hide on the edge of the lake in full view of the Flamingos, but unfortunately mark had to spend up to two weeks in the camouflage hide to capture the happening with the Flamingos, but despite this long two weeks stint, Mike was able to capture some spectacular images of the Flamingos. But the only real negative aspect of this particular filming is that at the same time the midges were hatching from the lake and everyone one get seriously bitten. But despite this, with Mikes perseverance, the intimate moments of the activity of the Flamingos helped to create the illusion of being there among the flock of Flamingos and transports the viewer through the extraordinary realms of the ENCHANTED KINGDOM 3D nature film.

Finally, ENCHANTED KINGDOM 3D [2014] is a spectacular 3D journey for the entire family, taking the audience on an immersive adventure, transporting the viewer from grey urbanity to the vibrancy and vitality of nature. Experience Africa alongside the filmmakers and go on an astounding exploration through an enchanted land where nature weaves its incredible magic.
