6354508,5,B00JC4XIZ4,Excellent DVD on the history of ice shows in america with fascinating interviews of former skaters. I am sorry these kinds of skating revues are no longer done except in europe but I have all my programs from the early ice shows that I attended with my mother in the late 40's and 50's. Aja Zanova was a big star with Ice Capades and she is still fabulous!! Every skating enthusiast should should have this DVD in their collection. Fantastic!!!,1411862400,5,444,4.5625
6354509,5,B00JC4XIZ4,"It's remarkable to have a film that chronicles the rich history of ice shows. As a skater who has only in the past couple years began a professional skating career, this film should be a prerequisite for those beginning to embark on that journey. Watching it has given me a greater appreciation for the art as well as a deeper connectedness to the great ice show legacy established over the years. Thanks to this film, these wonderful pioneers can be honored by a whole new generation.",1411430400,3,485,4.651162790697675
6354510,5,B00JC4XIZ4,"Keri did such a wonderful job making this film. It captures the history beautifully. You can feel the love coming through your screen as the skaters tell their stories as they remember ""the good old days"". Well done Keri!!!",1411084800,4,223,4.743589743589744

6354512,5,B00JC4XIZ4,Great item,1408147200,,10,4.5
6354513,5,B00JC4XIZ4,"Extraordinarily fine documentary of the grand era of lavishly-staged ice shows and of more modest recent 'stars-only' shows.  While some post-WWII shows in Europe are quickly cited, it's too bad that time did not allow for even a mention of Vienna Ice Review or Tarasova's Russian All Stars or even the Torvill & Dean spectacles of the early 1990s.  This is U.S.-centric and that's ok. But it's not the full story of international ice spectaculars.

All in all, though, this documentary deserves 5 big golden stars. Bravo!",1407542400,5,522,4.977011494252873

6354516,5,B00JC4XIZ4,"Fabulous Ice Age was wonderful. It brought back so many memories of watching all that theatrical skating, those tremendous costumes and it made me want to see it all again.
Now days you see single skaters. They are great skaters but I miss the spectical that used to go with great skating.
Sonja Henie, Ice Follies, Ice Capades, Holiday on ice now those were Entertainment with a Capitol E!
The Fabulous Ice Age brought all that back!
Sincerely .  Mrs. Robert Spencer",1405728000,6,467,4.695121951219512
8649691,2,B00JC4XIZ4,"Not good.

I didn't like it-probably because this is about my Grandparents generation (no offense, but it is)

It's just a lot of talking about way back then.

Not for me!",1519862400,,171,4.451612903225806

8649695,5,B00JC4XIZ4,"I thought I'd just watch this for fun, but after seeing it I decided to buy the dvd so I can loan it to other figure skaters at the rink. We're so hide bound by MITF and IJS that we forget what great entertainment skating can be. Maybe it will give us some inspiration for our rink's fall ice show.",1454803200,2,298,3.9833333333333334
