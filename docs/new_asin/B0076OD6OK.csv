8511053,3,B0076OD6OK,"This DVD is a good starting point, but I feel as if they were needlessly brief on each section. This DVD covers picking a puppy, socialization in the field, exposure to the hunting environment, exposure to birds, exposure to gunfire, exposure to water, intro to commands, the come command, the sit command, and the kennel command. All of this, along with an introduction and a wrap up, is a whopping 47 minutes and 24 seconds. I'll break this down into straight times so you can better decide if this training DVD is really for you. This is a very basic training DVD, though it doesn't go into much depth in each section, and each section could have been a little longer. I would suggest this DVD to someone like myself who has little to no experience training a dog, especially a hunting dog. I will be getting the intermediate and advanced DVDs at a later time, once I have begun the basic training with my puppy. I have owned dogs all my life, but this is the first dog that I will have since being on my own so it's the first dog I will be training from pup on and it will be my wife and my first hunting dog. If you have a little experience training dogs, this DVD is probably not for you. I wrote the times down for each section below so you may better judge for yourself if this might help you. In all I think this DVD is worth the money, but it is of limited utility. Bottom line, it beats searching youtube for scattered videos of limited or questionable veracity.

8511054,5,B0076OD6OK,"I purchased this video when I brought home our new German shorthaired pointer. He is our first bird dog. Not our first dog, but our first BIRD dog. Another reviewer dismissed this dvd as worthless for someone who has owned dogs before. I strongly disagree. We have experience training PET dogs, but this dvd covers training aspects such as introducing your dog to birds and guns that, I'm guessing here, most PET dog owners haven't dealt with before. I really enjoyed this video. Bob West is awesome, and the production quality is top notch.",1402012800,2,541,4.76595744680851
8511055,1,B0076OD6OK,Basically a rip off. I learned nothing new. The only person that could use this is someone who has never owned a dog before.,1382054400,,124,4.208333333333333
