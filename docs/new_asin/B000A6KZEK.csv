8074896,4,B000A6KZEK,"Cute film about marriages in various states decline set in France. It is the day of the wedding for Johanna and Benjamin, but Benjamin was out partying at his bachelor party the night before and can't remember what happened. Very much in the vein of most French farces: large cast of great actors, silly subplots, bits of romance & cheating, all with a (mostly) happy ending. 2011 Best Actor nominee, Jean Dujardin--The Artist, stars as Alex, who is bitter and angry about love--but gives an amazing speech about love at the wedding.

I'm glad I bought it, it's very French and very fun.",1328659200,2,587,4.699029126213592
