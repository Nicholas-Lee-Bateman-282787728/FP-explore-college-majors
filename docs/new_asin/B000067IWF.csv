7962954,4,B000067IWF,"Dragon Lee vs Five Brothers...Quality of film to dvd transfer very good.  Audio is okay and even the shots are not to tight on this one.  The Kung-Fu is excellant, Dragon Lee at his best.  Ending fight scene is a heart stopper.

7962955,1,B000067IWF,"Dragon Lee, just another so-called Bruce Lee wanna-be from the hand gestures to the sounds he makes. It's so obvious it's bad.

We all know that there are Kung Fu moves that's just so unbelievable it just couldn't be true, well this movie is full of them. The plot was horrible and I've been better fighting scenes in other Kung Fu flicks. Also, don't expect this flick to end with a bang because your hopes will be dashed to pieces. The last fighting scene was just horrendous. Please don't waste your money on this. I got to watch it for free on the Roku 3 and it was a total waste of my time. This movie is as bad it as gets, but worse!",1365292800,,639,4.153225806451613
7962956,3,B000067IWF,"I actually saw this as part of the BCI/Eclipse ""Kung Fu Connection"" 4pack.  The widescreen film transfer is a little faded and sometimes dark, but probably reflects the condition of the master reel(?).  It must have been cold during the making if this film, because you can see the players' breath(!) throughout the movie.  Now there's realism you usually don't see!
Admittedly, I did tire abit from Dragon Lee's flagrant--but implausible--emulations of the inimitable Bruce Lee.  While I do appreciate his fighting skills, I wish Dragon Lee would (have) just come into his own.  The storyline is rather weak, and some of the fight sequences a little hokey (showcasing the man with an iron hand), but action is ample.  The ""aerial"" attack on the arche-villian in the final fight scene is also memorable.  The one character I liked was the lone woman, an understated heroine, who actually kills a guy in one of her fights.  (I am still baffled, though, wondering why her brother wasn't with her at the very end.)",1058227200,,1011,4.871345029239766
