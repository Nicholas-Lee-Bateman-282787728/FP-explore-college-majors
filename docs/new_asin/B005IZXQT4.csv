4710708,5,B005IZXQT4,"This is a good DVD for relaxation or just as background ""mood"". It isn't a NatGeo/Discovery adventure, as the camera doesn't move or follow the fish. The camera stays still so your TV looks like a porthole into the ocean. The camera lingers on each scene for about a minute so you can really watch what the fish are up to... but not so long that you would ever get bored. Then there is a smooth transition to a different scene. We like that there is no narrative to follow, so we can play it in the background, and start/stop at any point.",1325721600,4,539,4.242718446601942
4710709,5,B005IZXQT4,"I bought this DVD after seeing a preview on Youtube. This DVD turns your TV into an ""aquarium"" with all different kinds of Nemos filmed in their natural environment. We play this DVD when we want to chill out. There are numerous scenes, from bright corals to deep sea. There are two music options (the piano is my favorite) or natural sounds. While it's not blu-ray, the picture quality is excellent and colors are rich. I love this DVD.",1322697600,4,437,4.544303797468355
4710710,5,B005IZXQT4,"Undersea Production's beautiful images and top notch editing already reflected in their Reefscapes DVD continues with Anemonefish - Nature's Aquarium; a DVD that blends amazing footage with captivating moments of natural marine life behavior.  I really enjoyed seeing the number of varying and intriguing species featured - Nemo and many more! Anemonefish are truly are one of the most endearing and fascinating marine creatures and it's very easy to watch them for hours, especially when the quality of the filming is this outstanding!

Anemonefish - Nature's Aquarium will have universal appeal to adults and children alike; one can learn about them by just watching this DVD and seeing how they tend to their eggs and their anemone host. This is an excellent DVD for your collection and great gift for any nature lover.  A real keepsake reminding us of how precious our endangered seas are . . .",1320278400,2,898,5.054054054054054
