8713886,4,B00WQT2C18,"If you like these guys beyond just listening to the occasional song you're likely to appreciate this DVD.  As others have noted, there are no playing moments on this disc, it is purely interviews.  They are very good interviews and give you some understanding into the group's motivations, influences and thought processes.  For me, it become clearer that the genuineness of their music isn't just an act they're trying to put on, but they really do seem like pretty regular guys trying not to let fame and worldwide acclaim go to their heads.",1456099200,,543,4.817204301075269

8713888,5,B00WQT2C18,"I love Mumford and Sons, and this DVD let's you hear from the band about their career - very interesting (and I don't understand the one star review here - the DVD description explains it's in-depth interviews and not wall-to-wall music). Really glad they're back!",1440028800,3,264,4.888888888888889
