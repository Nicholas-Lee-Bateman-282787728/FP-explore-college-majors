8659697,2,B00KLF5QW6,"Carl Henry Jessup (Paul E. Respass) is the Hillbilly Butcher. He is overweight, smokes, drinks moonshine, and is a cannibal. If you hunt on his property he kills and eats you. Much of the film is Carl involved in boring conversations. When he is not boring us with conversation, we get to hear his boring thoughts. On top of that the film was made to look grainy.

I was bored with the whole film.

8659698,1,B00KLF5QW6,"With a title like that, I didn't have high expectations when I plopped the disc in my player but, my god, I wasn't prepared for what a stinking bad film it was actually going to be. All the blame can be put on director/co-producer/co-writer/cinematographer/editor/actor Joaquin Montalvan's (the documentary SARAVIA - 2008; M O B I U S  - 2009; H O L E - 2010; C C K - 2015) skinny little shoulders. This shot-on-video disaster's biggest problem is the cinematography. There probably wasn't one button Montalvan didn't use on the video camera, as he gives it a fake grindhouse look, complete with fake emulsion scratches, dirt specks, jumping frames, and reddish color at the corners, like the film is beginning to turn vinegar. But the worst aspect of the cinematography is that it is shot mostly out-of-focus and given a sickly yellow palette. It's a very hard film to watch, not because of the subject matter, but because it looks terrible and you'll be doing more squinting than when you were a kid trying to watch scrambled porn on your cable box. The story is a simpleton's dream: Grandpa (S.E. Feinberg) gives his three grandchildren a choice: Either he will read them the children's story ""Bouncy Bunny"" (a fake book with lousy artwork) or he can tell them the Legend of the Hillbilly Butcher. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what the kids want to hear and we switch over to cannibal Carl Henry Jessup (Paul E. Respass, who died of a heart attack on April 21, 2014) as he is sitting at the edge of the river contemplating his life. We hear his thoughts, such as ""Ever since the Civil War, this country's been one big p***y."" (the word ""p***y"" is used a lot in this film). When Carl was a young boy, he watched as his father killed his mother and then cut his own throat. Just before Daddy died, he slips his favorite butcher knife to his son and tells him, ""It's yours now!"" (No? Really? I thought the neighbor down the street would want it.). Carl likes to kill people who trespass on his land, butcher them (we watch him cut up a woman in his bathtub and see her severed ear and head) and his friend Rae Lynn (Theresa Holly) comes over to cook and clean for him (she is related to him somehow, but it is never made clear how), not knowing the meat she is cooking is ""long pig"" (i.e. human flesh). Carl performs a religious ritual to a demon called Sam Bakoo (Allen East), where he says he would gladly trade his soul to have his Mama and Papa alive again (he keeps their mummified corpses in an upstairs bedroom), but the ritual doesn't seem to work. He is visited by a ghost girl named Jessie (Marie Moreshead), who tells Carl that Sam Bakoo is real and that his family is cursed. Carl continues to kill people, such as a hunter who is taking a poop on his property (complete with fart and squishy noises and the hunter exclaiming, ""Oh, that is wet!"") and a picnicking couple (when the male tries to kiss the female, she says ""I am not ready for tongue yet!"") and butchers them in his basement meat locker (The male picnicker gets away thanks to help from ghost girl Jessie). Carl has dreams about Sam Bakoo and tries to bury a box that contains Sam's deathmask on the top, but it mysteriously reappears in his meat locker with a small bottle of Carl's blood inside. Carl's best friend, the horny Billy Wayne (Chris Shumway), asks Carl if he can take out Rae Lynn on a date and Carl gives his blessing. When Billy Wayne tries to assault Rae Lynn and punches her in the face, Carl sees what he has done to her and has Billy Wayne drink a mason jar of moonshine spiked with rat poison and he dies (with bloody froth coming out of his mouth). When Rae Lynn learns that she has been cooking human flesh all this time (she discovers Carl's mother's mummified corpse in her bed and the bedroom is full of human body parts), she runs away with Carl chasing her. She turns the tables on Carl and kills him with his Daddy's butcher knife and then throws the knife in the river. We then hear a fake-sounding 1920's version of 'My Blue Heaven"" as we then see Carl tied to a chair in Hell, with his Daddy cackling and pulling out Carl's tonails and teeth with a pair of pliers while Sam Bakoo dances around him. Carl screams and the film ends, but after the end credits roll, we see Grandpa again giving his grandkids one final scare (if I had a grandfather like that, I would never visit him!).  The film is just awful and full of dialogue that makes your eyes roll in back of your head, such as when Carl chases a couple of drunk teens off his property and says, ""Hell, that meat wasn't ripe anyway!"". The film makes absolutely no sense, especially the Sam Bakoo and Jessie parts, and director Montalvan shows up every now and then as a drunk hillbilly who keeps ogling Rae Lynn from afar (and grabbing his crotch), only to end up being cut up alive, screaming as Carl pulls out his intestines and removes an eyeball with a knife and eats it. This is the film's only decent makeup effect, as the rest of the film is fake-looking slit throats (it's apparent it is the knife spurting blood, as the skin is not cut at all) and body parts shown after the butchering. There are other head-scratching bits, such as when Rae Lynn kills Carl. She folds his hands at his chest and lays an orchid on his body (where did she find an orchid without leaving his body????) before throwing the butcher knife in the river. And speaking of Rae Lynn: If she was such a good cook as the film portrays her, how could she not know that the meat she was cooking was human after cooking for Carl all these years? And how come during this whole time (since she also cleans his house) she has never been in the upstairs bedroom? The film is full of things that make absolutely no sense and, at at 99 minutes long, it's is a chore to sit through. You'll never want to see anything yellow again (I quit eating bananas after watching this film!). Do yourself a favor and skip this abomination, which supposedly won 6 awards at the Pollygrind Film Festival. If this is Pollygrind's example of a good film, remind me to never watch another one that they recommend. Also starring Ron Jason (as Pa Jessup), Doreen Barnes (as Ma Jessup), Tim Pasio (who also co-wrote the music and lyrics to a song in this film called ""Welcome To Hell"", performed by Midnight Angel), Suzanne Rick and Martin McSweeney.
