196399,5,1578071976,"The most realistic film ever made about climbing Everest, you actualy see the camps, the  climbing, some tests they take to measure the impact of high altitude on them, some good scenes of the Hillary Steps, also of the South Col and of course of the summit. They also point the place where Rob Hall is buried and you got to taste what a emergency in high altitude look like when one of the climbers gets in trouble on the way down. David Breashears and Ed Viesturs give you a good insight on what is climbing the everest in this movie
 Compare to the IMAX movie, this one is more realistic with more scenes of the mountain and the actual climbing although the image as espected is worst.  If you are interested in watching the real thing, this movie is as close as you can get.",997315200,7,778,4.315068493150685
196400,5,1578071976,"This is what everest is all about. Two of the best climbers of our time take you on a journey to the top and give you a taste of what it's really like at the top of the world, meanwhile undergoing cognitive testing and showing us what altitude does to the body and brain. Excellent video, one of my favorite.",977270400,,308,4.15
196401,4,1578071976,This dvd is an interesting one for the ones who love Mount Everest. Tells everything about climbing to Everest and living on high altitude. I rated that one 4 stars because there is not enough landscape pics.,971740800,,208,4.648648648648648
196402,4,1578071976,"A very interesting film that shows some of the mental incapacitance of being above 6000m.  It is more of interest to those looking towards the mental rather than the physical side of climbing in the high regions. Just  one note, the body that is shown in the fixed ropes is mistaken for Rob  Hall, when it is in fact Bruce Herrod from the South African expedition of  May 96.  To be fair, the IMAX film on the subject of this tragic year gives  more of the impact to the viewer.",956793600,10,478,4.2555555555555555
196403,4,1578071976,"I bought this DVD because I am really interested in Mount Everest and the people who climb it. It is interesting (even slightly amusing) to watch the climbers try to answers questions in rapid fire sucession at 29,000 feet  elevation (with 1/3 the oxygen level). Ed Viesturs, (considered by many to  be America's finest high-altitude climber) missed a question or two. David  Breashears (another one of America's finest high-altitude climbers (and  cinematographers)) does a  great job behind the camera with some  spectacular shots. Like all Everest stories, this one has it's share of  close calls, but I won't give away the story. By the way, we do not get to  see Rob Hall's body in the movie as the reviewer below (David S. Richard)  incorrectly states. What you DO see is the place where Rob Hall's body is  buried on the South Summit(under about 6 feet of snow). Interesting stuff  nonetheless as Rob Hall was quickly becoming a legend in his own right as a  guide on Everest.",954806400,30,983,4.785714285714286
196404,5,1578071976,"Unlike most movies of this genre, ""Everest the Death Zone"" attempts less to entertain than it does to educate.  While there is some outstanding footage of the climb itself, the video really gains its  strength from it's scientific examination of the physiology of high  altitude climbers.  Sure, there may be more glamorous videos available, but  you will not find one as gripping as this.  The film takes the viewer  through the planning stages, the climb and the post-expedition review of  the data collected and relates it to the extremely hypoxic environment  endured by the climbers.  As with all films made for a general audience,  there is even some drama as one climber suffers near fatal breathing  difficulties on the descent.  A particularly poignant sequence near the  summit shows the body of Rob Hall, the NZ guide, who died in the fateful  1996 tragedy.
On a scientific level, this account of high altitude  exposure is spot-on.  I have used it in college level classes to illustrate  the effects of lack of oxygen to my students.  Monitoring and recovery  equipment (pulse-oximetry and Gamow bags) is demonstrated in use on real  patients and suitable treatment and rescue strategies are discussed.
This  film cuts away the mythology surrounding much of the high altitude climbing  world and as such is a must see for any active or armchair climber.",948412800,50,1365,4.995535714285714
196405,5,1578071976,"I too have seen a number of everest films, as well as having read a number of mountaineering books, such as K2: Triumph and Tragedy, and of course, Into Thin Air.  This documentary captures the essence of a climb better  than any other I have seen.  Its focus is on the effects of high altitude  on the climber's mental skills and decision making ability, but you get  wrapped up in the drama of the climb right along with this. The drama  involves one of the climbers who starts out with a mild cough in base camp,  but progressively gets worse as he climbs highter, till he is on the brink  of death.  And none of it is a dramatized recreation, but the real thing.  From base camp, to each of the camps (I, II, II and IV on the South Col),  you are right alongside the climbers as they progress, then retreat,  progress again, and become acclimatized.  Breathtaking views from each of  these camps are shown, as well as the summit, and you really get a feel of  being there with them.  This is the first film I've seen a film that has  shown the South Summit and the Hillary Step up close, but on a somber note,  you see where Rob Hall spent his last hours near the south summit.  Before  this film I could only imagine what these points on the mountain looked  like.  Compared alongside the everest IMAX film, this is simply put  together and organized much better, with a true sense of what it is like to  be on the mountain and struggle with the climbers.  I suppose the IMAX film  was Breashear's warm up film for everest, and this was the result of a  year's reflection on how much better it could have been, and it succeeds  admirably.",948412800,73,1643,4.333333333333333
196406,5,1578071976,Excellent DVD on Everest! Have read a lot of books on the Himalayan Mountains (especially Mt. Everest) and this gives you a beautiful view of the area and what it is like to climb in the Death Zone.  A DVD you can watch many times!,1170201600,,231,4.133333333333334
196407,5,1578071976,"David Breashears was the director of photography on both this film and the Imax film made the year before. In my opinion, this film was more successful, at least as viewed on VHS on a medium-size old tv. That's probably because the equipment for Imax was so bulky and the filming process so cumbersome that just taking the footage was an accomplishment.

On this video, the purpose of the expedition was to study the effects of altitude on the human body, so it really focused in on the human aspect. As Breashears explains in his book High Exposure, the massive film size in Imax films requires that you not pull in close to a human face, because it will not make a good image when projected on a 7-story screen.

So in terms of home viewing, I really enjoyed this video and thought it helped me visualize the things I have read about so many times. The Khumbu Icefall and the treacherous ladders, the Hillary Step, the summit itself--I could truly feel that I was there. The images were crystal clear and very beautiful.

If I were only going to watch one video to help me get a picture of what a Himilayan expedition looks and feels like, this would be it.",1151625600,13,1159,4.4575471698113205
196408,5,1578071976,"This documentary is really wonderful.  But not wonderful for the glory of the conquest but showing just how deadly and treacherous this climb really is.  Whether you are a wealthy wannabe or an experienced mountain climber it is beyond my conprehension why any sane person would want to endanger his or her life like that. Where's the glory in being drug up to the top like a sack of potatoes?  It's almost sinful to play with your life in this way when there is no earthly reason to be there.

The camera work is breathtaking.  But it was painful to watch those climbers virtually dying in front of our eyes.  This NOVA is a real eye opener for respecting the one life you have been given.",1105401600,12,690,4.436507936507937
196409,3,1578071976,"I have 7 Everest DVD's and this one was not really as I expected. It was more clinical and of medical type interest and did not have to be Mount Everest to show the effects of low oxygen. They could have used any place above or around 8,000 meters. Frustrating in some senses because I felt a lack of Everest footage and views about the Death Zone etc., as well as being a fairly short film, sort of left me feeling wanting and slighty cheated. However, it goes fairly well with the collection since some of the other DVD's fil in the gaps.",1075248000,15,540,4.252427184466019
196410,5,1578071976,"This is an exceptional film with an abundance of information not found in other Everest films. I used to think the short IMAX movie was the best-ever Everest documentary, but I've changed my mind after seeing this. The photography here is just as stunning, and it's 20 minutes longer than the IMAX effort. The photography here is breathtaking, and they show extensive footage of the south summit. In no other documentary have I seen the Hillary Step in such detail, especially with climbers on it.
The film focuses on a climbing party, complete with Sherpa's and the obligatory personal profiles of each climber. We follow them from Base Camp to the various points above, then descend, then ascend again gradually to the peak. The debilitating effects of AMS and HACE are shown in excruciating detail. There are many segments of climbers in their tents, scarcely able to breathe or function properly. The courage of these climbers is awe inspiring, especially in the face of violent weather and the prospect of death on the mountain.
If you're an actual climber or just a vicarious Everest person like myself, you will enjoy this movie. It offers as much, or more, than the IMAX film and that is indeed high praise.",1059177600,23,1215,4.846153846153846
196411,5,1578071976,"Awesome DVD, tremendous filming !!!. Ed Viesturs and David Brashears couldn't do a better job. This a must see documentary for everyone interested in climbing all levels. Jodie Foster's narration seemed to be more than adecuated to the details of the film. Every single aspect of climbing at such altitude is explained very well; the preparation of the team, how do people behave at different levels of altitude, the problem of oxygen and the experiments taken every step allow us to realize that is not an easy thing to attempt climbing on this mountains. Compared to the IMAX movie wich is also an excellent piece of art, this one reveals other points of views and criteria that in another film you won't get. The only real question will be if the place signaled by the climbers was the real spot where Rob Hall spent his last moments.  From what I have read in books and in another publications, it seems that the place was a little bit different.  Never the less, this DVD is a high quality film.  Highly Recomended !!!!!!!!!",1055116800,9,1029,4.6740331491712706
196412,5,1578071976,"I am not a climber, but the history and the current people climbing Everest still is an interest to me. I brought the DVD over to a friend's, who clearly at the start wasn't interested in it. About half way through, he was watching intently. It reminds us most real drama happens in real life. And you learn a few things too. I'd recommend it.",1015372800,8,343,4.292307692307692
196413,5,1578071976,"""Anyone can climb Everest.  All you need is $70,000 and a Sherpa to drag you to the top.""  Not quite.  Even with two of the best mountaineers in the world as guides (David Breashears and Ed Viesturs) AND the trusty Sherpa; young, fit David Carter almost died in his attempt.
""Everest: the Death Zone"" should be required watching for any Everest wannabe.  The camera is unflinching while it pans the dead bodies like cautionary sentinels along the trail---the garbage strewn upper camps that look more like badly maintained junkyards than the most majestic mountain on earth---a traffic jam at 28,000 feet (are you seriously telling me I have spent all this money to get to one of the most remote places in the world, to be one with nature, and I'm in a TRAFFIC JAM?  Yes.)
The film has magnificent footage of the treacherous Khumbu Ice Falls showing horizontal ladders laid across yawning crevasses that must be traversed.  (What I want to know is: Who lays and affixes the ladders?)  This area is the most objectively difficult on Everest, and it is early in the ascent between Base Camp and Camp I.  This means it has to be crossed, not once, but many times carrying supplies to the higher camps and adds exponentially to Everest's dangers.  The camera work on higher reaches of Everest, including the summit is breathtaking.
So what went wrong that put David Carter in peril of his life?  This is the heart of the film:  the effect on the human body of extreme altitude.  In a nutshell, we are not designed to survive above 21,000 feet.  No matter what your skills (or that of the ever-dependable Sherpa), you are vulnerable to hypoxia, pulmonary and cerebral edema, frostbite-all potentially lethal.  To add to the danger, if you can't walk out, you will probably die.  No one can carry you and there is no possibility of helicopter rescue if you are higher than 21,000 feet.  You are without support and very alone.
The film has a great deal of scientific explanation with graphs and visuals.  Maybe too much for some viewers, but this is Nova after all.  There are excellent close-up photos of high tech equipment and demonstrations of how it is used.  The color is sharp and clear and the audio is first-rate.  ""Everest:  The Death Zone"" doesn't pull punches and has great integrity.  Highly recommended.",1006041600,51,2311,4.739348370927318
196414,5,1578071976,"This is a superb presentation by Nova that was directed and produced by award winning filmmaker, David Breashears, and Liesl Clark. Narrated by Jodie Foster, the film explores the high altitude climbing experience and the effects of hypoxia, lack of oxygen, on the brain. In order to do this, scientists will track four climbers, as they tackle Everest, among them David Breashears and Ed Viesters, two of the world's reknowned high altitude climbers.  With baseline tests having been conducted stateside, the effects of altitude will be measured, as they climb the highest mountain in the world.

Asides from the filming of the scientific tests conducted to provide information on the effects of altitude, there is spectaculatr footage of Everest and its environs. There are  breathtaking views of the Khumbu Ice Fall and the great expanse of the Western Cwm. The viewer also gets to see what a bottleneck on Everest looks like. It is pretty amazing to find crowds and congestion in such a vast and remote place. It is also disconcerting to see the amount of trash that is left behind, creating environmental concerns where, until fairly recently, none had existed.
Along their journey, the climbers come across the grisly remains of a climber who did not make it. They also come to the final resting place of the late expedition leader, Rob Hall, who froze on the mountain, when he refused to leave the side of his friend and client in order to save himself, during the 1996 Everest disaster. The viewer sees just how lonely and remote that final resting place is.

When the climbers summit, the viewer is treated to a spectacular vista from the top of the world with beautiful snow capped peaks peeping through fluffy clouds. With this ascent, Ed Viesters becomes the first non-Sherpa to have reached the summit of Everest five times. Unfortuantely, one of the other climbers, who  reached the summit, became quite ill from the effects of altitude. Yet, all descended safely. Later, additional tests would reveal that Ed Viesters, who routinely makes high altitude climbs without the use of oxygen, has had portions of his brain affected. The scientists, who conducted the tests, would like to check back with Ed Viesters over time for a follow up.

All in all, this is a very interesting and informative film, with breathtaking cinematography. As a DVD, it offers chapter search, close captioning, a link to Everest: The Death Zone website, and Dolby Sound. It is pretty much a basic DVD with nothing fancy other than the film itself, which is first rate.",1000166400,83,2559,4.9257540603248255

7799094,4,1578071976,"This film shows us the effects of lacking oxygen through brain scans, audio puzzles, pulse measurements, and an explanation of the deadly scenarios. It proves to me that lacking oxygen can severely impair one's decision-making ability and cause deadly lung problems.

On the downside, the film leaves me wondering how much risk comes from the cold. It also gives us a lot of loose numbers (blood oxygen level and pressure numbers) and test cases without much explanation, and does not really tie up the conclusion. Overall, the 60-minute film leaves me wondering: wait, is that it?

Nonetheless, this is a very unique medical-Everest film, and I do very much appreciate the risks these hikers put themselves in to deliver this product.",1359331200,,735,5.066115702479339
7799095,3,1578071976,"This is a mountain climbing documentary intending to masquerade to some extent as a scientific endeavour. The mountain pictures are nice and even impressive, but the scientific subtext is between not very interesting and sometimes even laughable. The editing is fairly traditional, with lots of talking heads alternating with action and scenery. This is not bad, but there's better stuff elsewhere (touching the void for instance, which isn't a documentary but has wonderful mountain pictures and is much more thrilling at the end of the day)",1259020800,,542,5.313953488372093

This one is distinguised by its dissection of what happens to the human body when it tries to survive in the thin air atop Everest. It left me feeling a bit nauseous. You wonder why so many risk their lives to go there. Western documentaries like this one also don't dwell on the fact that the native Sherpas are required to help the outsiders get to the top by aluminum ladders and ropes already installed.
