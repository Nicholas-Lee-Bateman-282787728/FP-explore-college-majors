8413226,1,B00423BEEW,"This is without a doubt one of the worst films I have ever seen in all my years of movie watching. There is nothing redeemable about it in any way. Director Alfonso Brecia (herein billed as Al Bradley) actually made some decent movies back in the heyday of the Sword and Sandal films. But apparently by the time he made Ator the Iron Warrior, Alfonso had forgotten everything he ever knew about filmmaking. And the production values are nil. Some of the scenes are actually shot on leftover sets from the movie Popeye; not the most logical choice for a Sword and Sorcery movie to say the least. The two leads, Miles O'Keefe and Savina Gersak, are saddled with terrible hairdos in addition to having no screen presence whatsoever. This Italian DVD has an English language option but the sound quality varies from scene to scene. The image is sharp and does have nice color as if that could possibly compensate for how rotten the movie is.",1470096000,,937,4.616766467065868
