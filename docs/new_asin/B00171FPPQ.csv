8264619,5,B00171FPPQ,"Manswers does a great job of addressing those stupid questions you ask when you're a teenager during a drinking binge, in a hilarious, comedic way.  Sure, it caters to extreme crassness, so if you don't like crude humor with awesome babes, tight asses and huge breasts, this show isn't for you.  For those of us who can relax and appreciate those things that appeal to our baser nature, this show is for you.",1277337600,6,408,4.575342465753424
8264620,1,B00171FPPQ,"If you're under 20, drink beer, have a few 'tats', & some wimpy facial hair, this DVD is probably a laugh riot for you. If you're none of those things like me..you can appreciate this show is designed for a 'younger' man than I am which is fine.

The narrator is annoying, and every other 'manswer' topic involves 'boobs' which is fine--boobs are great, but the segments like 'how many pounds of pressure from a boob would it take to crush a beer can?' are pretty stupid. Unlike 'The Man Show' with Adam Corrola & Jimmy Kimmel which I loved, this show is for guys who still use the word 'dude' at least once each sentence.",1217548800,5,622,4.362068965517241
