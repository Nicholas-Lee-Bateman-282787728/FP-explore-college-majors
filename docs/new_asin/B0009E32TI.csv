By the way, on the sites I've seen, the Flair/Rhodes match says its from the Bash 85 which would be a different match from the one on Bloodbath. I don;t know if they fought at Bash 85? Hope we'll find out soon.",1115251200,2,428,3.8636363636363638

Ric Flair vs Ricky Steamboat - Chi-Town Rumble '89

Hulk Hogan vs Randy Savage - Wrestlemania V

Kerry Von Erich vs Ric Flair - David Von Erich Memorial

Ric Flair vs Sting - Clash of the Champions

Tully Blanchard/Arn Anderson vs Barry Windham/Lex Luger - COTC

2282090,5,B0009E32TI,"This collection could be the greatest release WWE has done to date, but the early match listing seems to indicate, for many collectors, that half of the matches included will have already been on other WWE releases.

The following matches *will* be included:

- Ric Flair v. Dusty Rhodes (Great American Bash '86, as seen on ""Bloodbath: Wrestling's Greatest Steel Cage matches"")

- Harley Race v. Ric Flair (Starrcade '83, as seen on ""Ultimate Ric Flair Collection"")

- Sgt. Slaughter v. Pat Patterson (Madison Square Garden, as seen on ""WWE Hall of Fame 2004"")

- Don Muraco v. Jimmy Snuka (Madison Square Garden, as seen on ""Bloodbath: Wrestling's Greatest Steel Cage matches"")

- Randy Savage v. Ricky Steamboat (WrestleMania III, first time on DVD)

- Jerry Lawler v. Kerry Von Erich (AWA Superclash III, first time on DVD)

- Hulk Hogan & Mr. T v. Roddy Piper & Paul Orndorff (WrestleMania, first time on DVD)

- Greg Valentine v. Roddy Piper (Starrcade '83, first time on DVD)

World Wrestling Entertainment used to be bad about putting the same matches on multiple DVD releases, but they have been good lately with providing brand new matches to DVD (the last one with a lot of repeated matches was Mick Foley's Greatest Hits & Misses, but its new matches far outweighed the repeats).

Hopefully this early report will either be wrong, or the rest of the collection has a better ratio of new-to-repeats for the loyal WWE consumers.",1114992000,6,1438,4.828571428571428

Hopefully, they'll put some old NWA stuff on there, because a lot of the 80s (especially early 80s) WWF stuff sucked.  Speaking of sucking, or what doesn't suck, a man who truly deserves a comprehensive DVD set, our Olympic hero Kurt Angle.  It should be a three DVD set

Disc one should cover the era Angle had hair, including:

Sean Stasiak (Survivor Series 99 - Angle's debut)

Val Venis (Smackdown - Angle wins European title)

Chris Jericho (No Way Out - Angle wins Intercontinental Title)

Rikishi (King of the Ring Final)

The Rock (No Mercy - Angle wins first WWF title)

Armageddon (6 man Hell in the Cell)

HHH (Royal Rumble 2001)

Chris Benoit (Judgement Day - 2 out of 3 falls medals match)

Booker T (Smackdown - WCW title match)

Disc two should cover the bald era

Hulk Hogan (King of the Ring - Hogan taps)

Chris Benoit (Unforgiven)

Any of his tag team matches with Benoit as his partner

Chris Benoit (Royal Rumble)

Brock Lesnar (Wrestlemania 19)

Charlie Hass (Angle's return)

Brock Lesnar (Summerslam)

Eddie Guerrero (Summerslam)

Disk three should be full of promos, including some from the early days, the love triangle with Mr and Mrs HHH, team ECK (Edge, Christian and Kurt), Austin and Angle from the summer of 2001, Team Angle, and his rendition of ""Sexy Boy"" with Sensational Sherri

Maybe even include a segment devoted to all those who he made tap out.  The people demand it, we want our DVD.  It's true!",1114300800,2,1514,4.683206106870229

2282170,3,B0009E32TI,"NOTE: This is a review of only the documentary portion of the presentation as I saw it through a replay on WWE's Classic On Demand channel.

The 1980's is known to most people as the ""BOOM"" period of professional wrestling with Vince McMahon taking his WWF promotion worldwide resulting in crossover appeal into different forms of entertainment media never before seen along various territories in the National Wrestling Alliance expanding in popularity to the point where some of them broke off into their own individual promotions achieving a level of success with the biggest promotion in Jim Crockett Promotions attempting a national expansion of their own, and some of the biggest crowds in wrestling history including a worldwide indoor attendance record.  Now this is one of those documentaries that we've seen on various projects such as the ones on superstars of the 90's & 2000's where where certain wrestlers are selected and their important moments of the 1980's are profiled with ""Mean"" Gene Okerland hosting this set.  It should also be noted that at this time the only footage WWE owned besides their own was WCW (and all the territories that the promotion evolved from) and AWA so key figures from other promotions such as WCCW, Mid-South /UWF, CWFH, and other territories are exempt from the list they chose amongst others for various reasons I'll get into later on.

Superstars & profile highlights include:
Bobby Heenan - His time in the AWA, involvement in WrestleMania I & III, The Bobby Heenan Family, ""Weasel"", Gorilla Monsoon & Prime Time Wrestling, The Bobby Heenan Show

Junkyard Dog - His universal appeal & popularity breaking racial barriers, his ""juke"" dance, ""Grab Them Cakes"", his time in WCW/NWA, his death, Hall Of Fame.

Roddy Piper - Setting a record in his first match, first big break, relationship with Ric Flair, ability to talk, Dog Collar Match vs. Greg Valentine at Starrcade, War To Settle The Score & WrestleMania I, feud with Mr. T, Piper's Pit, Hall Of Fame

Jerry Lawler - How being an artist got him into the business, becoming ""The King"", feud with Andy Kaufman, AWA Champion, partnership with Bill Dundee, becoming a commentator & relationship with Jim Ross

Arn Anderson - Growing up, breaking into the business, relationship with Ric Flair, 4 Horsemen, becoming ""The Enforcer"", his retirement

Dusty Rhodes - The Texas Outlaws, NWA Champion, charisma & ability to talk, feud with Ric Flair

Ricky Steamboat - Training under Verne Gagne, feuds with Ric Flair, ability to adapt to his opponent's style, partnership with Jay Youngblood, WrestleMania III vs. Randy Savage

Jimmy Snuka - Innovative high flying style, popularity, Piper's Pit incident, Steel Cage Match vs. Don Muraco

Bob Orton - 2nd generation wrestler, technical wrestling ability, relationship with Roddy Piper, his ""cast"", involvement in WrestleMania I

Iron Sheik - Training with Verne Gagne, becoming Iron Sheik, WWE Champion, feud with Sgt. Slaughter, tag team with Nikolai Volkoff, Hall Of Fame

Paul Orndorff - Early territory days, WrestleMania I, partnership & feud with Hulk Hogan including the Steel Cage Match, ability as a heel, Power Plant trainer, Hall Of Fame

Hulk Hogan - Breaking into the business, first run with Freddie Blassie, WWE Champion, leader of WWE, every WrestleMania involvement, WCW & nWo, return to WWE, Hall Of Fame.

Bonus matches also include the Starrcade 83 Dog Collar Match between Roddy Piper vs. Greg Valentine, Sgt. Slaughter vs. Iron Sheik from MSG, Intercontinental Champion Greg Valentine vs. Tito Santana in a Lumberjack Match, Junkyard Dog vs. Randy Savage in the finals of the Wrestling Classic tournament, and Ultimate Warrior vs. Bobby Heenan in a Weasel Suit Match from MSG.

Now the profiles themselves were good as they pretty much ran a summary of their influences or highlights of their career of the 80's & beyond with some profiles going into more details than others.  I've always said whenever WWE makes a list like this in that the choices will always be debatable & can never come out with a list that pleases everyone but some of the big negatives here what I stated earlier in that WWE didn't have the extensive video vault that they have now so that heavily limited their choices of who to put on this list (such as Kerry Von Erich) while others were chosen strictly because of their induction into the Hall Of Fame (Bob Orton) when others who accomplished more that WWE does have access to footage for are excluded from the list (Andre The Giant & Randy Savage are the first two who come to my mind right away).

Overall it was a nice presentation on the superstars showcased here so I would recommend for anyone who was a fan of WWE or NWA/JPC/WCW during this period of time.",1396569600,,5237,4.947548460661346

2282221,5,B0009E32TI,"Just wanted to say a little something about this set.  For some reason and I don't know why, the WWE insists that the Snuka/Backlund match took place in May of 1980.  That is not the case.  If you look at the history of the WWE or WWF, at no time in 1980 does Backlund ever defend the title against Snuka in a cage.  I believe the date in 1980 that they are referring to is when Backlund took on Ken Patera for the title in a Texas Death match at MSG.  The Snuka/Backlund match really took place on June 28, 1982 and actually won PWI match of the year.  Just wanted to put that out there for any collectors and such.  Otherwise this is a really good set and fantastic matches.  Thanks!",1380326400,,685,4.136363636363637

2282256,4,B0009E32TI,"A relatively large collection of wrestling matches and promos during the decade of 1980's from the WWE. 15 wrestlers are featured in 3 seperate DVD's with Mean Gene Okerlund setting up the intros to a short bio piece on each superstar. Although short, the bios are effective in setting up the importance of each wrestler during the decade.

One thing that grates on my nerves a bit is the fact that the WWE changes(or edits out) the original entrance songs. JYD used to come out to ""Another one bites the dust"" all the time-now it's ""Grab them cakes""(which is lame). For a short period in 1984, the Hulkster used ""Eye of the Tiger"" as his entrance theme. Now those are all edited out. Oh well.

Overall this is very nice collection of wrestling nostalgia for those who grew up in the 1980's watching this stuff. Aside from the then-WWF stuff, you also get matches(and promos/interviews) from the AWA, NWA, and Mid-Atlantic regions. Of course there were other very influential wrestlers from the 80's that could easily fill up a volume 2 of this collection. Nonetheless, an enjoyable collection.",1279929600,3,1094,4.8138297872340425

Macho Mans absence is  ridiculous!

Thanks goodness greed prevailed and Mr McMahon has released the ""Macho Madness"" 3 dvd set...",1244592000,4,395,5.190476190476191
2282258,5,B0009E32TI,"I won't break down my own ratings for each match, nor will I talk about everyone else who COULD have been on these DVD's but I did want to say a few words because I think this set is excellent and definitely worth buying.

First of all, I think the picture quality is excellent.  It's amazing how much better the footage looks on DVD discs.  I had a few of these matches on commercial VHS tapes and the video quality on DVD is so much crisper.  They really cleaned up the footage to the point where you'd think you're watching a match from this week's RAW or Smackdown.

Another thing that really stands is out is just how great some of these men were in their prime.  I started heavily watching wrestling in the late 1980's and a few of the stars on these discs had already gone a little past their prime by then.  When I watch Jimmy Snuka vs. Bob Backlund in the steel cage match or Roddy Rowdy Piper vs. Greg Valentine in the dog collar match, it was a far cry from watching a haggered Snuka vs. the Undertaker from Wrestlemania 7 or Greg Valentine in his Rythym N' Blues days when he feuded with the Bushwackers.  Also, anyopne who has only seen Sgt. Slaughter thje last few years on RAW would have absolutely no idea how athletic he was in the days when he was in shape.  Even by the time he ""defected"" to the Iraqi cause, he was a far cry from the wrestler he is on this DVD. The same can be said for many of the people featured in this set.

I will go ahead and single out a favorite match and no, it's not an obvious one.  The match that intrigued me the most was Bobby Heenan vs. The Ultimate Warrior in a ""loser wears weasel suit match.""  You would think this would be an ugly match and in some ways it is.  The Warrior obviously isn't a technical expert and Heenan was probably 15-20 years older and 100 times wimpier.  However, Heenan was absolutely priceless in the way he sold this match.  Any other aging manager vs. Warrior would have been an absolute snoozefest, but Heenan somehow pulled it off for the both of them.  As for the rest of the matches, I like some more than others but they all are enetratianing in their own ways.

By the way, if you enjoy watching these matches, you might want to check out the Legends of Wrestling video games, especially Showdown.  A lot of thw wrestlers featured here are featured there, also.  While there are a few better wrestling games out there, the rosters are unbeilievably deep and you can usually pick them up for $10-$15 a pop.

But back to this set, I definitely think it a lot of fun and worth buying.  It's also a great value for the money, as you get almost 10 hours worth of matches and interviews (including the hidden extras) for about the price of a currebt WWE [ay-per-view.",1159401600,4,2747,4.295145631067961
2282259,3,B0009E32TI,"I enjoyed this set. As a big fan of old school wrestling, I thought this disc could have been better. I started watching wrestling in 1983. I watched WWF till 1985, then it starting getting comic bookish, once the whole Rock and Wrestling thing started with Cyndi Lauper, Lou Albano, Hogan, Piper, and Wendi Richter, and Moolah. So I started watching Jim Crockett Promotions and the NWA, along with WCCW with the Von Erich's which WWE now owns the rights to. I also used to watch the AWA and Florida Championship Wrestling with Gordon Solie. If I had to pick some of my favorite matches it would have to be. Flair vs. Kerry Von Erich from the David Von Erich Memorial Parade of Champions from Texas Stadium, The Flair-Steamboat trilogy, Windham & Flair from 1987 WorldWide Wresling. Sting and Flair from Clash I in Greensboro. Without a doubt Slaughter Sheik infamous bootcamp match from 6/16/84 MSG (Why they didn't include this match is beyond me. Slaughter-Patterson alley fight at MSG. Snuka-Muraco MSG cage match. Wargames I from the Omni in Atlanta Warriors,Rhodes,Koloff, & Ellering vs. Flair,Blanchard,Anderson/Luger & JJ Dillon. One of the Magnum TA and Nikita matches from their best of 7 series. A Rock n Roll Express and Midnight Express match. This is just to name a few I could go on and on. Abdullah the Butcher and Bruiser Brody always had good matches. This set does have some good ones though. If you can get it for $15 or lower it's well worth it.",1156032000,2,1466,4.73046875
2282260,5,B0009E32TI,"I enjoyed this wholeheartedly. Mainly because wwe did a little tweak on the formula. Instead of mimicking the one-time use of the Flair dvd formula or using the formula that everyone else gets this three disc sets spreads everything around. All the featured stars get their own video package highlighting parts of their career that made them famous or recognizable. Then every wrestler gets their own match, some of which overlap which makes things interesting. Although we do see some perennial ""best of"" favorites it was nice to see some obscure pieces of footage. Who would have guessed Sal Bellomo would be on a dvd in the 2000's.

2282262,5,B0009E32TI,"Lately I've been (and always have been) on a nostagia kick, more so than the average fan. It's something about the 80s (the WWF) that I love so much I just can't identify it (I know I sound markish, but bare with me here!). This 3 DVD set about the Greatest Wrestling Stars of the 80s is a definite testament to the trend setters as far as the 1980s go. Maybe the reason why I appreciate the 80s so much is because if it wasn't for the 80s, there wouldn't be a wrestling business today, and for that, I appreciate the decade of the 1980s. Here's my review of the matches with a little extra material as well:

(Note: Workrate fans, try not to take these ratings TOO seriously. This is the 80s I'm talking about here, so even though there is ONE 5 star match, try not to search for TOO MANY of them here. My ratings are based on real feelings and nostagic purposes. I hope you understand.)

Also, I use WWF here, as this was the 80s, a different time and era.

Disc 1

Bios:

Bobby ""The Brain"" Heenan

The Junkyard Dog

Sgt. Slaughter

Greg ""The Hammer"" Valentine

""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper

Matches:

Greg Valentine vs. Roddy Piper - NWA United States Championship Dog Collar Match - Starrcade 11/24/83, ***1/2 (We begin with a very good match from the NWA. They entertained me with this one.)

Sgt. Slaughter vs. Iron Shiek - Madison Square Garden 5/21/84, ***1/2-**** (I honestly have to watch this match again. I truly enjoyed the brutality of this match, as this one was WAY before the hardcore material that was populated in the 90s. As for the Sheik and Slaughter, they brutalized each other in this one, and had the MSG crowd roaring.)

Greg Valentine vs. Tito Santana - WWE Intercontinental Championship Lumberjack Match - Madison Square Garden 3/17/85, *** (A decent in the long feud between these two.)

Junkyard Dog vs. Randy Savage - Wrestling Classic Tournament Finals - Wrestling Classic 11/7/85, DUD (I'd have to say that this match had no redeeming qualities, but for nostagic purposes, it's fine.)

Ultimate Warrior vs. Bobby Heenan - Weasel Suit Match - Madison Square Garden 6/25/88 (Not really a match, but for comedic purposes, there is none better from this time period.)

Extras:

Junkyard Dog performing ""Grab Them Cakes"" at the 1986 Slammy Awards

Arn Anderson

Dusty Rhodes

Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat

Ric Flair

Matches:

Dusty Rhodes vs. Ric Flair - NWA World Heavyweight Championship 1 Million Dollar Challenge Match - Starrcade 11/22/85, ** (What can I say about this feud? Yep, they drew money back then, as Flair was one of the ONLY performers to this day who get something fairly watchable out of Dusty Rhodes, this match included.)

Ole & Arn Anderson vs. Wahoo McDaniel & Billy Jack Haynes - NWA National Tag Team Championship Match - Starrcade 11/28/85, ** (This is your semi-standard NWA tag team match here.)

Jerry ""The King"" Lawler vs. Kerry Von Erich - Championship Unification Match - AWA Superclash III 12/13/88, *** (A pretty good match. I'm not familiar with a lot of the AWA's material, but this match stands out for fans of the former promotion.)

Ricky Steamboat vs. Ric Flair - NWA World Heavyweight Championship Match - Chi-Town Rumble 2/20/89, ***** (WOW! One of my favorite matches and one of the greatest matches of all time, Flair and Steamboat's series will go down as the greatest series of all time. This match, along with the two rematches later in 89, set standards that will never be equalled.)

Ric Flair vs. Jay Youngblood - Mid Atlantic Championship Wrestling 2/3/82, *1/2 (An average match here. You can safely say that Flair was still honing his style in a way to eventually emerge as the Nature Boy.)

""Cowboy"" Bob Orton

Iron Shiek

Paul Ordorff

Hulk Hogan

Matches:

Jimmy Snuka vs. Bob Backlund - WWE Championship Steel Cage Match - Madison Square Garden 5/19/80, *** (A good match here. Two of MSG's favorites during this period.)

Iron Shiek vs. Bob Backlund - WWE Championship Match - Madison Square Garden 12/26/83, *1/2 (A shocking moment as the Sheik captures the title from Backlund. Behind the scenes, Backlund claimed that he had no knowledge that the towel was going to be thrown in.)

Paul Ordorff vs. Salvatore Bellomo - Madison Square Garden 1/23/84, *1/2 (Worth a look to see the early days of Paul Orndoff.)

Iron Shiek vs. Hulk Hogan - WWE Championship Match - Madison Square Garden 1/23/84, *1/2 (Not a great match to be sure, but Hogan capturing the WWF title for the first time started the ball rolling for the phenom known as Hulkamania.)

Bob Orton vs. Jimmy Snuka - Madison Square Garden 2/18/85, **1/2 (Above average match. Snuka and Orton could perform with the best of them around this time.)

Roddy Piper vs. Hulk Hogan - The War To Settle The Score - Madison Square Garden 2/18/85, **1/2 (Above average here. I always wanted a TRUE one on one match between these two on a WWF PPV.)

2282292,4,B0009E32TI,"WWE produces good quality documentary DVDs (I can't always say the same about their raunchy live shows).  This is another well-made, interesting, and entertaining WWE DVD.

It brought back lots of memories for me.  A lot of the 80s gimmicks seem corny and overly tame by today's standards, but they seemed pretty dumb to me at the time, too, and I was just a kid.

One sort of sad thing is to see Bobby Heenan's commentary.  He doesn't sound or look anything like he used to.  He appears gaunt and withdrawn and slurs his words.  He says with a touch of sadness in his voice that he misses the days of going out there and entertaining the fans (realizing, I'm sure, that he will never again be a personality on any wrestling programming).",1137974400,3,738,4.503759398496241
2282293,4,B0009E32TI,This was a very good DVD. It was just missing so much stuff. I really liked the way they did the superstar's biographies. Very informative. Would have liked to have seen Jesse Ventura and others though.,1137801600,,202,4.638888888888889
2282294,4,B0009E32TI,"The biographies are a lot of fun to watch and it's great to see the matches. As for who's included and who's omitted, I agree with all the inclusions except Bob Orton and maybe Paul Orndorff. I kind of wonder about those. The most glaring omission is Randy Savage, but Tito Santana, Kerry Von Erich, Andre the Giant, Tully Blanchard and maybe Nikita Koloff could have been included over Orton and Orndorff.",1137628800,,406,4.652777777777778
2282295,3,B0009E32TI,"This DVD is a good sampler of some of the biggest stars in wrestling during the ""decade of decadence"".  Some of the stuff is rehashed from the old ""Confidential"" show and other DVDs - but it still is good and is a must for any old school fan.

Each chapter is dedicated to a particular star.  Some bios are more detailed than other, but all give a sketch of each respective career.  The ones that stand out are Bobby Heenan, Roddy Piper, the emotional tales of Arn Anderson's upbringing, Bob Orton and Dusty Rhodes.  The footage of Rhodes really steals this package, showing some of his incredible promos from the 1970s and 80s.  You can't beat a line like ""I'm dined with kings and queens and lived off pork and beans"".  You just can't.

The extras are also very good.  Like all WWE DVDs, there is some stuff included that make you scratch your head.  However  there are some incredible and essential matches inside.  The ones that stand out are the Sgt. Slaughter vs. Iron Sheik match from 1984, Hulk Hogan vs. Roddy Piper from 1985, and Ric Flair vs. Ricky Steamboat from 1989.  Madison Square Garden, the mecca of northeast/WWE wrestling is prominently featured also in the documentary.

The wealth of footage the WWE owns is teased in this collection.  This is definitely a great gift idea for a ""wrasslin"" fan.  Pick it up.",1133222400,3,1329,4.591489361702128
2282296,2,B0009E32TI,"I just rented this bad boy because I had to see how great the greatest wrestling stars of the eighties would be before I threw down the thirty bucks it costs to own such a ""treasure.""  After seeing the likes of Junkyard Dog, Bobby the Brain Heenan, and Jerry ""the dirty old man"" Lawler being featured as ""greatest wrestling stars of the eighties,"" which in Heenan's case doesn't even make sense since he was a slap-stick manager, I knew to be a little skeptical of this DVD.  Good thing too, because this DVD fails on all counts to deliver what it promises.

It promises to give biographical information. It fails; all it gives is rehashed stuff that's been recycled on television and other DVD's such as the hall of fame induction or Ric Flair's DVD.  If you've never seen any of this stuff before, then by all means I say go ahead and check it out.  They do a good job at reminiscing about the colorful characters and give you some neat history about how they came into the business, but these bio segments (the main feature of each of the 3 DVD's) are not enough so that you should buy this thing.  The DVD does nothing to put any of them into the context of the decade they supposedly are defining, nor does it really explain where these big names are supposed to fit in relation to each other, or the super success of wrestling at that point in time.  Oh well.  That's not why I buy wrestling DVD's anyway. (I like to watch the wrestling!)

Secondly, this set promises the greatest stars of the eighties but leaves out inexcusable omissions such as Randy Savage, Ted Dibiase, the Bulldogs, and a list of others that could have probably been included.  Instead we get a decent list, that as I've already indicated, includes less than ""greatest"" performers as well.  Junk Yard Dog was funny, so was Bobby ""the brain,"" but I don't recall either of them being the ""greatest"" wrestlers.  Or even ""stars"" for that matter. Whereas Randy Savage was a bonafied superstar and yet he is only featured in one match on this DVD and is not featured as a ""star"" at all (also the match he's in happens to suck.)  Not to say that I have anything against Junk Yard Dog, but frankly if he's on this set, shouldn't Brutus the Barber Beefcake be on it too? I mean if we are going to aim so low, why not?

But worst of all, beyond any head scratching that might ensue from who made this set and far more troublesome, is that this DVD promises ""Classic matches."" These matches with about 2 or 3 wonderful exceptions are simply awful. They even have truly good wrestling talent such as Greg Valentine, who has had many great matches, and Roddy Piper as well; but instead of giving us a ""classic"" they show some lame gimmick ""collar match"" between the two of them which features no wrestling, and by today's standards is too tame to really spark any sense of danger.  Many of these matches were simply very poorly done, and I have to admit that partly that was the way it was done back then (pro wrestling has come long way since then, and the standards for performance truly are much higher), but mainly I think these were all simply bad choices.  Boring, choppy, fake punch fests make up the majority of this set.  I think in four consecutive matches I could count less than 10 wrestling holds or maneuvers which is pretty bad when we consider that this set is called ""the greatest WRESTLING stars of the 80's.""  But the term wrestling in pro-wrestling has always been misleading.

The great exceptions to how terrible some of these matches are of course, a great Flair/Steamboat match, and what I thought was a pretty great tag match with the Minnesota Wrecking Crew (Ole and Arn Anderson). Also there is another great but incomplete match between Flair and Jay Young Blood.  Now I know what you're thinking, I must be some kind of Ric Flair mark, well I like him, but he's never been a favorite of mine, it just so happens that the Flair matches included on this set are pretty outstanding. Even the Flair match against Dusty Rhodes was pretty good in comparison to the rest included here.  (You could say that this DVD does a great job of adding to or completing the Ric Flair Ultimate Collection).

Overall what you get is what I suppose was supposed to be big name matches from the time, such as Hogan winning the world title from the Iron Sheik.  Unfortunately for high profile matches they almost all come short.  Most unforgivable however are all of the truly great matches from this time that they did not include, that were both big in name and great as entertaining matches.  Where was Steamboat vs. Savage at Wrestlemania III for instance?  The bottom line is that this feels like a half hearted effort and a poorly scouted compilation of wrestling matches from the 80's that should have and could have been much better.  It doesn't exactly do any of these wrestlers (exception Steamboat and Flair) much justice, and makes the 80's look like a decade of incompetence in the ring rather than the wildly entertaining decade it truly was for ""sports entertainment.""",1127433600,5,5056,4.551876379690949
2282297,4,B0009E32TI,"I was glad when I saw this DVD coming out. There was a good selection of wrestlers on the DVDs and their profiles were pretty cool. However, some of the matches could have been extremely better. For instance, the match with Ole and Arn Anderson could have been different. Who cares about Billy Jack Hayes and Wahoo McDaniel? What about a match with them against the Steiners or LOD? Also, some of the profiles were a bit redundant, mainly with Hulk Hogan and Ric Flair. I have both of their DVDs and they just took stuff from those and put it in this one. They left so many people out too. What about Macho Man Randy Savage? Curt Henning? The Fabulous Freebirds? Ivan or Nikita Koloff? Andre the Giant? The Rock and Roll Express? THere has to be a part two to this, otherwise, WWE will just leave us hanging.

I particularly liked the section on Bobby ""The Brain"" Heenan - himself not a succesful wrestler, but along with Jimmy Hart, one of the best managers the WWE has ever seen.

The biographies are well done and 70% of the matches are well chosen. The DVD's come in a nice set, but a program should of been included. It's a great set for those old schoolers like me. A lot of feud were left out like the Chief Jay Strongbow/Greg the hammer Valentine feud, but all in all it's a great DVD set that will bring back memories, especially when you watch the biographies.

2282324,5,B0009E32TI,"I found this 3 dvd set at a good price:$26 dollars in CANADIAN money,so i can be indulgent a little. First, i will say that the short biographies are nicely done;i actually viewed them all in succession. As for the matches,i was glad they featured many of the best rivalries of the decade:VALENTINE vs SANTANA,SLAUGHTER vs IRON SHEIK and FLAIR vs STEAMBOAT.Now on the bad side,the ULTIMATE WARRIOR vs HEENAN fight doesn't belong there,and the LAWLER vs VON ERICH one is a prime example of how a refery can miss by not seeing that LAWLER was using an object to make VON ERICH bleed profusely to win the match because there was no disqualification. Missing from the collection is ANDR THE GIANT's best match against STAN HANSEN;the battle of the CANADIAN champions RICK MARTEL vs DINO BRAVO( as good as the STEAMBOAT-FLAIR feuds)and as mentionned by others the STEAMBOAT-SAVAGE that we only see cliped. It is obvious that BOB BACKLUND was still injured when he fought the IRON SHEIK.All in all,this is an interesting collection that will confirm us why BOBBY HEENAN became a manager. Sure there are wrestlers that are missing:HANSEN,MARTEL,STUDD,ANDR etc but weasels are cheaper than JAPAN copyrights.",1121299200,,1199,5.0
2282325,4,B0009E32TI,This was a pretty good dvd but a lot of the people on this dvd had better matchs then the one we got all in all well worth it but i should have been a few different matchs hopefully we will get a stars of the 90s,1121126400,,212,3.5319148936170213
2282326,4,B0009E32TI,"This is an incredible collection. But I really feel that it is for the fans that enjoyed it during that era. I can't imagine the fans that started watching during The Rock, Austin, Mankind era or god forbid the stuff that passes for wrestling these days.

3 discs isn't even enough to cover this era, there are plenty of Stars left off, I am hoping this is a Volume 1 of sorts and the WWE will make more if the fans take to this one.

I truly enjoy the depth and time they explain each SuperStar and the impact they made during their time. They really go in depth almost going through the entire career. Sure some the the depressing stuff is left off (i.e Steamboat's 2nd run in the WWF) but I think that is for the better.

Going in depth with guys like Paul Orndorff, Arn Anderson, & Ricky Steamboat, shed light on some characters that were never over the top gimmick wise.

I was also to see Dusty Rhoads on this collection expecially since his stint with the WWF in the early 90's was laughable at best. But I respect Vince and the WWE for not just showcasing WWF talent and really showed a nice spectrum of guys that were wildly popular, but not to the Hogan Status.

For fans of the Old School 80's wrestling this is the kind of stuff that reminds me why I enjoyed wrestling in the first place, and begs the question, does Stephanie McMahon and the current creative department at the WWE watch any of this stuff? They should be using these as molds for current characters. While the match tempo has changed over the years, close attention to good in ring action never goes out of style.

One thing I noticed is that despite the characters of your Hogan's, Piper's and Slaughters, the SPORT of wrestling was taken a lot more serious.

The Bad....

One thing i did miss was the absence of Randy Savage and Elizabeth. Granted this guy deserves the 3 disc treatment ahla Ric Flair, but he should have a segment on this disc. Not only was he one hell of a heel for Hogan, but he had some amazing matches with Tito Santana, and of course Ricky Steamboat. Plus he is one of the most original characters to ever come out of the Wrestling scene.

The other thing dearly missed was Ventura's portion of the commentary. I wish Vince would reach into in pockets and get Jesse some $$ for his awesome commentary. Really some of the matches were just that much better with Jesse in the booth.

All in all if you enjoyed the wrestling in the 80's this will make you feel like a kid again. Awesome collection and I surely hope there is another set in the making (Savage, Santana, Steele, hell you can even put Kamala and Steve Lombardi on there). And 80's tag team collection wouldn't be bad either. Hart Foundation, Demolition, Bulldogs, Dream Team, Islanders, Rockers, Brain Busters)",1120348800,16,2775,4.44488188976378
2282327,4,B0009E32TI,"This is a must-have for any WWE collector, especially the ones like me who have 2-3 shelves full of old Coliseum Videos (ah, the memories...)

There has to be a volume 2 to this, and maybe 3, because it will take more than 3-discs to cover the most important decade in pro wrestling history.

My issues with the timelines and WWE getting their own dates right?  First of all, and it stems back to the ""Bloodbath"" steel cage DVD, the Snuka/Backlund cage match occured in 1982, not 1980.  It still reads ""5/19/80"" on this new 80's DVD.  The Superfly even says it himself in his interview that Vince Sr. called him up to NY in 1982, where he made his WWF debut as a heel in January of that year.

My next gripe is Sgt. Slaughter's story.  The way they tell it, his AWA matches from 1985 occurred before his nice, long character-establishing stint in the WWF from 1980-84.  They barely covered any of his heel days, except for his street fight with Pat Patterson.

Slaughter was on TV every week back in the day, issuing his ""Cobra Clutch"" challenge, see who could break his dreaded finishing hold.  Sound familiar?  Can you say Chris Masterson?  I wonder if they didn't mention the Cobra Clutch Challenge for fear of over-shadowing Masterson's ""Masterlock Challenge"" that's been played out on RAW for the last few months.  But, then, over-shadow what?  This is about wrestling's glorious past.

That's it, though.  I really enjoyed the other segments.  Piper's interviews were great, especially his rants about Mr. T.  And, I have to take my hat off to the WWE for their presentation of Junk Yard Dog.  JYD, RIP.  His popularity in the mid-80's rivaled Hulk Hogan's at many times, no question.

Volume 2?",1120176000,7,1701,4.65993265993266
2282328,4,B0009E32TI,"I have to agree with some of the other reviewers in that this is a good, but not great DVD.  The wrestlers mini biographies are good and the matches bring back memories.  However, outside of the Flair/Steamboat match,(Lawler v. Von Erich, Slaughter v Iron Sheik and Snuka  v Backlund get honorable mentions) there isn't anything that spectacular.  Why was the Orndorff v. Bellomo match included?  A squash match from MSG? Heenan v. Ultimate Warrior was an odd choice as well.  Why not include Heenan in his survivor series match?  Hogan v Orndorff from the Big Event,  Savage v Steamboat has been mention on numerous occassions.  Wargames would have been an excellent addition that would have featured Flair, Anderson and Rhodes.

I guess that it is easy to critique the match decision when there are so many glaring oversights.  Perhaps some of the choices are politically motivated.  Overall the DVD is worth purchasing if you a fan of 80s wrestling.  If you are a fan of today some of these matches are not the best the 80s had to offer.",1119571200,2,1040,4.743016759776537
2282329,4,B0009E32TI,"It's not just all matches, they also do a 10-15min biography on the 15 wrestlers they showcase on the DVD. I have to admit the short biographys are VERY well done. I realized something..None of the matches that had Jesse Ventura do commentary are on this!!?! WTF? I think it has to do with the royalties lawsuit they have.. What does this mean? Well basically all the WWE's big matches from 85-89 are missing including Savage/Steamboat, Savage/Hogan, Bulldogs/Hart Foundation, etc..etc.. Lots of NWA matches could've have gone here too including Wargames, Sting/Flair and any of the NWA tag teams matches..

MATCHES:
1. Greg Valentine vs. Roddy Piper (Starcade 11/24/83) - This is a Dog-Collar match. This means both wrestlers are attached by a chain around their neck! Valentine injuried Pipers ear and now Piper want revenge. **** (out of 5 stars)

2. Sgt. Slaughter vs. Iron Sheik (MSG 5/21/84) - This isn't the famous Boot Camp match, it's the one before. Really good brawl! ****

3. Greg Valentine vs. Tito Santana (Lumberjack match 3/17/85) - Lumberjack Match means if someone is thrown out of the ring, they get thrown back. There is no escape! These guys have had much better matches. **1/2

4. Junkyard Dog vs. Randy Savage (Wrestling Classic Finals 11/7/85) - JYD is fun to watch, and this match reminded me just how freaklishly awesome Savage was in the 80's. **1/2

5. Ultimate Warrior vs. Bobby Heenan (Weasel Suit Match - 6/25/88) - Whoever loses gets stuffed in a weasel suit. OMG Heenan is a better bumper and worker than Ultimate Warrior! Seriously! 1/2*

6. Dusty Rhodes vs. Ric Flair (NWA Championship - Starcade 84) - Flair defends the NWA title. Whoever wins gets 1 million dollars.  Special guest ref. is Joe Frasier. Not bad! ***1/2

7. Ole & Arn Anderson vs. Wahoo McDaniel & Billy Jack Haynes (NWA Tag title - Starcade 85) - Pretty fun old school match, but nothing special. **

8. Jerry ""The King"" Lawler vs. Kerry Von Erich (AWA Superclash III 12/13/88) - Famous unification match. Whoever winds gets both the WCCW and AWA World titles. ****

9. Ricky Steamboat vs. Ric Flair (NWA Title - 2/20/89) - From Chi-Town Rumble. YES! They've complete the Flair/Steamboat trilogy on DVD! Flair defends the title. Match of the DVD *****

10. Ric Flair vs. Jay Youngblood (2/23/83) - Don't know why this is on here. Wow Youngblood was pretty good! Shame he passed away. :-( Short match. ***

11. Jimmy Snuka vs. Bob Backlund (WWE Title - Cage match - 5.19.80) - Awesome cage match. Not as crazy as modern cage matches, but back then it was the equivalent of a Hell-in-the-Cell. ****1/2

12. Iron Sheik vs. Bob Backlund (WWE Title - 12/26/83) - Another famous match. Backlund defends his title against Sheik. **1/2

13. Paul Orndorff vs. Salvatore Bellomo (1/23/84) Bellomo actually good here, but come on! They should've had Orndorff Vs. Santana, Piper, or Hogan matches.. **

14. Iron Sheik vs. Hulk Hogan (WWE Title - 1/23/84) - Sheik defends his title against the Hulkster. The MSG crowd is insanely in favor of Hogan. ***1/2

15. Bob Orton vs. Jimmy Snuka (2/18/85) - Ughh. Best of 80's? WTF? I think this was last match Orton had before he put on the famous cast. *1/2

16. Roddy Piper vs. Hulk Hogan (The War to Settle the Score from MTV - 2/18/85) - Wrestlingwise, not very good. But fun to watch.  ***1/2

This isn't a Best of 80's DVD. The lack of WWF material from (85-89) is unforgivable. More like a Best of WWF (1982-1984).. But what's here is pretty good. If you got some spare cash lying around, and you watched wrestling in the early 80's, particular the MSG one's, you'll love this set!",1118966400,92,3620,4.717460317460318
2282362,3,B0009E32TI,"First off, the Wrestlemania III match between Steamboat/Savage is NOT in this set. All you get is the little highlight package (which is exactly the same one included in the Wrestlemania XX DVD in the 10 Best Wrestlemania Matches).

The matches are decent, not great. The WWF in the 80s had great stars, but the matches weren't of the best quality. What really comes across in this set how much better NWA matches were than WWF matches. The only real gem in this set is Flair/Steamboat from Chi-Town Rumble '89. An incredible classic.

What's really disappointing are the pieces on the individual wrestlers. The one on Ricky Steamboat is nice, and it's great to hear from him in interview form, but the rest of the stuff is just rehashed from the old WWE Confidential series. The stuff with Flair is either from his DVD or from WCW.

Overall, some decent stuff here, but it could have been so much more.",1118966400,,903,4.63125
2282363,4,B0009E32TI,"Obviously, this collection has its flaws. For one, it focuses solely on singles wrestlers and ignores the many great tag teams of the era (Road Warriors, Bulldogs, Rock N' Roll and Midnight Expresses).  Perhaps they'll rectify this with a separate collection.  Another problem is that they left out probably the #2 star of the 80s for the WWF, Randy Savage. His exclusion is probably politically motivated (he doesn't get along with Vince or Hogan).  Then again, they included Rhodes even though he doesn't work for Vince and hasn't had the best relationship with him.  Finally, no disrespect meant, but Arn Anderson and Bob Orton have no business being featured.  Arn was, at best, third banana behind Flair, Blanchard, Luger and Windham in the Horsemen.  Orton never did much except act as a foil for Piper and Adrian Adonis. Their inclusion seems more a nod to Ric Flair and Randy Orton than anything else.

That all being said, the profiles of the stars included are great and its a treat to listen to all of them (sans JYD and Rhodes) discuss their careers and the highlights include some rare footage I've never seen anywhere before.  The matches are pretty great for the most part and the other extras make this a set worth having. Let's hope this is the first of many ""Legends"" sets to come.",1118966400,,1299,4.742222222222222
2282364,3,B0009E32TI,"Ok, I am a HUGE Ric Flair fan and crave any dvd with his matches on it. I bought this dvd set to have the Chi-Town Rumble 89 match with The Dragon. However, wwe made strange choices to include the million dollar match with Dusty. Hech, the match only lasted 15 min and was stopped early because of a cut to Dusty's eye. What a joke! WWE should have included the match where Flair wins the title from Dusty in 81..
The Fourhorsemen Interview is killer. Any fan will love that. The retrospective on Flair is mostly on Flairs 3DVD set, BUT the retro on Rick Steamboat is way cool with lots of references to Flair. Another bad choice by the WWE was not included the full match from Wrestlemania 3 with Savage and Steamboat. The DVD only gives ""highlights"". Maybe they are saving that one for a Savage DVD set??? I also liked the stuff with The Hammer and with Piper. So, overall this dvd has alot of hits and alot of misses..",1118966400,,921,4.2988505747126435
2282365,4,B0009E32TI,"For anyone who was a wrestling fan back in the 80's, this DVD set is a treat! The 3 DVD set consists of short retrospectives of 15 of the biggest stars of the era, including ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper, Hulk Hogan & Sargent Slaughter as well as numerous additional features which help bring this set in at a healthy 8 1/2 hours in length. While the biographies are OK  (which is why I didn't rate this as 5 stars), the real treasures are the bonus matches involving the featured stars. The WWE has not focused only upon thier own heritage. Since the WWE owns the archives of most of the wrestling organizations which have disappeared, he is able to include non WWF matches. One of the ones on this set is the (in)famous dog collar match between Piper & Greg Valentine from the very first NWA Starcade, which I had heard about, but had never seen. There are 15 full length matches in all, & they make the set worth purchasing. WWE--please keep this up! i can't wait for volume 2!!",1118793600,,971,4.394444444444445

2282369,5,B0009E32TI,"I was surprisingly pleased to somehow find this DVD set at my local Wal-Mart, a week before it's apparently supposed to be released. Judging from previous descriptions, I was expecting 3 discs of matches. The WWE pulls through again. The matches are part of the extra's. Here's how this set is set-up. Each disc contains 5 Superstars, each with a roughly 10 minute video biography, with some great clips from their past. Then there are 5 matches on each disc (6 on the 3rd disc actually). Then there are extra...extras, mainly interviews & promos. Of course, there are the hidden extras, which I haven't gotten to just yet.

Disc 1 features Bobby Heenan, JYD, Sgt. Slaughter, Greg Valentine, & Roddy Piper. None of the matches on disc 1 have been previously shown on another WWE DVD (Santana/Valentine is not the same match as shown in the Hall of Fame 2004 DVD).

Disc 2 features Jerry Lawler, Arn Anderson, Dusty Rhodes, Ricky Steamboat, & Ric Flair. Again, none of the matches on disc 2 have been previously shown on another DVD (the Flair/Rhodes match is from Starrcade 84, the match on Flair's DVD set is Starrcade 85).

Finally, disc 3 features Jimmy Snuka, Bob Orton, Iron Sheik, Paul Orndorff, & Hulk Hogan. This disc contains the only match with has previously been shown on another WWE DVD, which is Hogan/Iron Sheik.

This is another great DVD set, & I'd highly recommend it to any wrestling fan.

Why I give this 5 stars is that this was a golden era for wrestling which exploded in the mid '80's with Wrestlemania. Anyone who were fans of these stars will love this as most of the wrestlers tell us where they came from and of how they got into wrestling, how they trained and prepared for matches. They speak on how they met and how they were matched up and their highlight matches. They were all complimentary to one another in working together, not only on building their characters but also in making the storyline so entertaining. Rowdy Roddy Piper was great and complimentary to all bar Mr T. Every wrestler and manager spoke about their time in the industry except Dusty Rhodes who was fondly remembered by Ric Flair and others. There are many highlights and I was most moved by the story of Arn Anderson. Other highlights are Ric Flair, The Iron Sheik, Ricky Steamboat, Sgt Slaughter, ""Mr Wonderful"" Paul Orndorff & Hulk Hogan, they were all great stories plus the best manager of all time Bobby ""The Brain"" Heenan.
