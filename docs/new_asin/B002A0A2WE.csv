8358793,5,B002A0A2WE,"I enjoyed this shoot interview much more than the Ric Flair multi-disc set. I think mostly because Roddy brings out the best in Ric and Roddy is just so open and honest and terrificly funny and sincere. Ric can be a bit of a politician on his own so Roddy keeps it real. The bonus features are also plentiful and fun..
If you are a fan of either of these entertainers I'd highly recommend this DVD.",1259971200,,398,4.25
