8342863,5,B001U3YNOK,Nora has figured out a way to participate when her owner/guardian gives piano lessons. It's so much fun to watch Nora concentrate on the keyboard and execute appropriate rhythms and melodies. She is a dear character.,1383523200,,216,5.027777777777778
8342864,5,B001U3YNOK,"This is my now 19 month old grandson's favorite video.  He sways to the music the cat plays, at the same time focusing all his attention on the television screen.  I enjoyed seeing the cat perform online, but this is so much more interesting.  It is presented in several parts of only a few minutes each, each charmingly described and edited.  This is an extremely interesting phenomena that is very well documented and illustrated on this DVD!  It is interesting and short enough to appeal to younger viewers yet versatile enough to play all at once if so desired for younger and/or older viewers.",1261785600,,598,4.711538461538462
8342865,5,B001U3YNOK,"I purchased ""Nora The Piano Cat"" DVD: Expanded Version 2009.....for my Mom as a gift just recently. She is an animal lover and has (3) cat's of her own.....so I thought she would enjoy having this movie for herself. I first saw the video on YouTube....and was totally surprised to actually see a cat playing the piano. There are several clip's of Nora....and one more cuter than the other. I tell you, there is a part in one....where she sound's like she's really playing a tune. She play's solo as well as some duet's....with her owner (teacher) and one of the teacher's private student's. There is also a holiday clip....where she play's while the teacher sing's a Christmas song. As well, there are a couple clip's of interaction's with her (2) other cat playmate's which are really funny.....and also some slide show's of Nora that are absolutely adorable. But, what's really something to see....is Nora actually sitting up on the piano stool playing the note's, with not only one but both PAWS. The music selection's are really nice....and the video photography was done well. I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who loves animal's, cat's or otherwise....and I think it would make a great Christmas gift for someone.  Nora is An Amazing Cat!!",1257724800,,1255,4.864485981308412
