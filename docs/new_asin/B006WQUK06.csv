5026190,5,B006WQUK06,"Looking for something to watch on my new ipad I came across this early Cagney flick, watched it in one sitting, very entertaining as a story and fascinating from the standpoint of Cagney's career.  He plays a cabbie for a small company fighting the dirty tactics of the dominant cab company in NYC. As always he is the compelling character in every scene. Tough sometimes, charming sometimes.
Beautiful Loretta Young holds her own as Cagney's ""girl"".

A little ""fun fact"": Cagney speaks fluent Yiddish in his opening scene.  I lived for many years in Switzerland where ""Swiss German"" is spoken.  Well I was shocked to hear Cagney speaking what I thought was Swiss German!  Who knew?  But found out it was Yiddish which is very close to Swiss German.

Cagney also displays his dancing talents with a mean Foxtrot, and a short tap dance.

Enjoyed the story and acting.  One of the few Cagney movies I didn't see on TV as a kid.",1356912000,3,925,4.625766871165644
5026191,5,B006WQUK06,"If you don't appreciate looking at life in the early 1930s, if you don't like the music from the early 1930s, if you don't like the snazzy cars from the early 1930s, if you don't like seeing the feminine clothes and pretty fluffy soft & shorter hair on women in the early 1930s, if you aren't interested in seeing movie stars long dead who were very young and appealing in the early 1930s, don't buy this dvd. My parents were a really good-looking couple with 2 kids and one on the way, but they lived from hand to mouth during this period known as the Great Depression.  In many respects this movie reminded me of them.  I loved this movie the first time I saw it on Turner Classic Movies.  When it became available on Amazon.com, I had to own it so I could view it every few months and think about my pretty mom.  She looked so much like Loretta Young in the early 1930s - - not so much in later periods.  Now you may understand why I gave it 5 stars.  There are many other early 1930s movies with Loretta Young I already have and enjoy; most notably, ""Midnight Mary"" ""Employees Entrance"" and ""Man's Castle.""  She was quite a good little actress for being only 19 and 20 years old in 1932/1933.",1350086400,5,1196,4.288888888888889
5026192,3,B006WQUK06,"In 1932, James Cagney was on a box office roll in a series of cheaply made contemporary stories ""torn from the headlines"".  In this one, he is a cab driver in New York, competing for business and always ready with his fists. Loretta Young is his leading lady, the improbable daughter of cabby, Guy Kibbee, who is jailed for shooting the guy who smashed his cab in order to run Kibbee out of business.

The film has the usual quota of slang and low lifes and moves at a fast clip under Roy Del Ruth's slick direction. The first half is probably the best before melodrama takes over but the real highlight is the unexpected rapport of the leads. Cagney and Young may seem an ill matched pair but at this stage of her career, Young was not only beautiful, but hot and she plays off Cagney's energy with a nonchalant and submissive air which is perfect. She is as riveting as Cagney and who could ignore those beautiful big eyes!

The DVD has been issued under the Warner's Archive banner which means the print is unrestored, there are no extras and the DVD has been issued ""on demand"".  In this case, the print is adequate.",1342915200,7,1120,4.422330097087379

5026194,4,B006WQUK06,"I find this an interesting look at the world of the 1930's and what struck me is the world of the time. Back then the various elements,and we are in depression like times ourselves so a perfect mirror to look through,were not as well educated as we are today,so if education should right wrongs,as i'm sure it does,these movies are ancient,but if they are tales of human nature gone amok they are as perennial as spring flowers! Here we have the taxi business of new york city,1932,and the first scene is of a police officer,and we have various hard on their luck people trying to make a living,some trying to survive through court,and dieing in jail. One of the highlights in the movies is the dialogue between men and women. The women are very attractive in all their flapper type exuberance and mystique...the dialogue in first half is good and they are combative and stake their ground,and try to relate in this case jimmy's wife to him. However,at a rally he finds betrayal in her. Of course he tries to let it pass...and then near the movies end she betrays him to the police,and at the time the source who is going to provide some support for her. It's interesting to note on this world,where the police do not really relate to the male world,and are dependent on the female...and draw what you want from that. The character of his wife here though ends up leaving her abode at pictures end...she got what she deserved! And no one helped her...the people she confessed to fast disappeared. The best scene in the film and most revealing is after Cagney's brother dies,his killer who interferes and honest people's works life and causes disruption throughout the city,in all kinds of business and personal relations,its jimmy's character who preserves the dignity of the dead,an ancient cultural custom which comes actually from the start of religious custom. There's a reason why the writer labors this point,almost giving up all his money for the burial. The moralityin the film springs from Cagney's character...an interesting look at a bygone era,good early dialogue with the flapper like and appealing women,and the world of black and white cinema has virtues which gaudy colour at times doesnt...I found an interesting study with young children and they refused to watch it but after watching it and questioned,they were able to real discrete elements in black and white film making which they don't in colour..the old film maker john huston,and many of the ancients,had problem with the
colour process...however its here and part of modern life!!",1334448000,,2558,4.8963133640553

it was her. I actually bought the DVD as a gift for a friend who recently began driving a cab, and his girlfriend.",1412812800,2,380,4.291666666666667
5026199,3,B006WQUK06,"Uneven but entertaining pre-Code artifact from the Depression era. James Cagney carries this Warner Bros. programmer on his tough-guy shoulders. An offbeat melding of romantic-comedy and crime genres, ""Taxi!"" (1932) would be relatively forgotten without Cagney's vital presence and Roy Del Ruth's assured direction. Keep an eye on George Raft as a competitive dancer. The long-overdue Warner Archive DVD features a sharp 35mm transfer.",1393718400,,435,5.8125
5026200,4,B006WQUK06,Earlier Cagney films always cast him as a punchy Irish guy fighting his way to where ever he wanted to get. Taxi is no different. Cagney's earlier films helped mold him into the tough character actor that he became.

5026203,4,B006WQUK06,"That's the question this 70 minute little movie asks in reference to hot-head independent cab driver Matt Nolan (James Cagney) and waitress Sue Riley (Loretta Young). The two are brought together after Sue's dad, Pop Riley (Guy Kibbee), has his cab deliberately smashed by a truck driver due to a war between the independent cab drivers such as Pop and Consolidated Cab. Pop grabs a gun and shoots the smirking truck driver dead in the back.

Pop dies in prison and Sue becomes a pacifist, urging the other cab drivers to shun violence. Matt wants the cab drivers to take the fight to the Consolidated Cab company. Matt and Sue are attracted to each other despite their differences and marry. Matt promises to change and keep a lid on his hot head. But then a drunken member of Consolidated Cab's muscle men, Buck Gerard, kills Matt's brother and Matt wants to kill the guy himself before the cops can find him - anything the police can dish out is too good for his brother's murderer, he figures. But then Matt would be a murderer too and Sue will do anything to prevent having a second loved one sent to prison. How does this all work out? Watch and find out. Sure, Matt is in the wrong here, but Sue takes some questionable actions herself begging the question - why doesn't she just call the police and TELL THEM where Gerard is, once she knows? Warner Brothers keeps this rather routine plot interesting with a good solid cast. Besides leads Cagney and Young you have George E. Stone as Matt's cab driving friend and constantly gabbing Leila Bennett as Sue's friend Ruby, which make for very colorful double dates. Then there is David Landau who looks as mean as he acts here as Buck Gerard, the drunken muscle that kills Matt's brother. Dorothy Burgess is Marie, Buck's girl. She's an attractive well-spoken girl and you can't help but wonder what she sees in such an abusive slob who is bound to turn his violent personality on her from time to time.

Some strange coincidences of film history make this one worth watching closely. Notice who James Cagney's character loses the dance contest to in the opening half hour or so - George Raft, famous for his Charleston, as an uncredited extra! During that dance contest a small part of ""Yankee Doodle"" plays, 10 years before Cagney plays the song's author, George M. Cohan.

Also, when Sue and Matt are double dating with Skeets and Leila they are going to the movies. The camera shows they are going to watch ""Her Hour of Love"" starring Donald Cook and Evelyn Knapp, both Warner Brothers stars of the day. They even show a rather stilted love scene from the movie once inside the theater. Problem is, that film never existed! I wonder why Warner Bros. just didn't show a clip from a real film they were trying to promote at the time rather than going to all of this trouble? It would have been cheaper, and, after all, the word ""cheap"" was music to Jack Warner's ears.",1372723200,,2924,4.586998087954111

8505862,5,B006WQUK06,"Ive recently become a big James Cagney fan, and having just finished reading his excellent autobiography, Ive come to the sad understanding of how the majority of films produced under the ""studio system,"" which valued quantity over quality, often forced actors (including Cagney) to squander their talents in production-line pictures with anemic scripts in order to fulfill their seven-year contracts and create more product for the movie-going public. Regardless, Cagney, a true master of characterization and performance, brought something special to each role he played, and ""Taxi!"" is no exception. While more of a ""popcorn film"" than anything else, it is unquestionably one of my favorite Cagney films, and one that I find gets better with repeated viewings.

As a refreshing contrast to the downbeat, ponderous gangster films that made up the bulk of his oeuvre, Taxi! is an entertaining, briskly-paced film that is impossible to describe as anything but an ubergenre film: While gangsters play a pivotal role in the plot, crime is not the main focus. Rather, there is a little bit of everything: Romantic comedy, drama, action, and even an opportunity for Cagney to dance. I personally find these types of films more interesting and more realistic, as real life is never just one mood at a time. The fact that this was made in 1932, before the Hays Code was strictly enforced, gives it a looser, more freewheeling atmosphere than later 30's films, and certainly adds to the fun.

It saddens me that James Cagney was and continues to be pigeon-holed as a ruthless, gun-toting tough-guy, an image that obscures the charming, intelligent man who brought a special sincerity and humanity to every role he played. In Taxi! thankfully, we get to see Cagney at his best, playing Matt Nolan, a young New York taxi driver, who, in an almost affectionate spoof of the tough-guy, gangster characters he typically played, is just an ordinary guy, who does his job, takes his girl to the movies, and gets himself into more than his share of fights due to his spit-fire temper. When one fight inadvertently leads to the murder of his younger brother, Matt sets out on the path to revenge. Nolan is a more relatable, sympathetic character than Cagneys usual heavies, and gives him the opportunity to inject some real pathos, comedy, and even show off his impressive dancing skills, not to mention his fluency in Yiddish! While Cagney does handle a gun in one scene, the majority of the film deals with Matts often rocky relationship with his sweet but plucky girlfriend Sue Reilly, played by the always-beautiful Loretta Young, who, at only eighteen, manages to hold her own opposite Cagney masterfully. Their chemistry is wonderful, and it was a nice change to see Cagney as more of a romantic lead, even one with such a short fuse!

The plot itself is fairly simple and straightforward, yet kept my interest all the way through. I liked that the filmmakers avoided padding-out or overstretching it; the spare 69-minute runtime feels just about right. The script has some genuinely witty one-liners, and really helps to define the characters and set the appropriate rhythm. I was also really impressed with the way 1930s New York was depicted through the set design. Whether it was a busy street, a moving subway, or a cramped tenement, everything looked and felt authentic, and lent a lot in the way of atmosphere.

Falling somewhere between the grit of ""The Public Enemy"" (1931) and the fun of ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" (1942), two other excellent Cagney films, ""Taxi!"" is high on my list of favorites. For Cagney fans or anyone who enjoys seeing a little slice of life from the 1930s, don't pass this one up!",1506124800,,3700,4.943729903536977

8505865,4,B006WQUK06,"If you're a James Cagney fan this film is definitely worth buying. The DVD doesn't have any special features, but the movie is certainly worth the money.",1453680000,,153,4.703703703703703
8505866,2,B006WQUK06,"Not really worth getting on DVD because the movie is only 69 minutes long. It's not even really that great a movie as the plot is rather silly and simplistic. But because it's an old movie the remastering is limited and it's difficult to understand all the dialogue in the movie. And this DVD has no captions or subtitles at all. I may have enjoyed it more viewing it on Amazon Instant Video, which does provide captions. I should have been more careful about my order and sought any opportunity to avoid a DVD purchase because my house is already filling up with too many DVDs and pretty soon my house will become a swimming pool where I'll be swimming in DVDs!

But since this movie is not really the classic everyone makes it out to be and is mostly good to view for film historical curiosity, it's better to get it on Amazon Instant Video. Though both the DVD and the digital version of this movie are savagely overpriced, and it cannot be rented (for reasons unknown), those who wish to view it with captions should view it on AIV. If you don't care about the captions, see if it's available on Youtubes, or pay the expensive price if you have the money to spare. That's how life is sometimes. At least the cost of this movie is nothing in caparison to the cost of a doctor visit, or an extension class at your local college or specialty school. Man, has the cost of living gone crazy...!!!",1453420800,,1395,4.406976744186046
