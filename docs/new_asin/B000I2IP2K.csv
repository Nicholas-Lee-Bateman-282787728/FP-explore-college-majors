2652688,4,B000I2IP2K,"and it is likely more than any one fan really needs, for the diamonds and the dregs both are preserved on these discs. Laurie is now a big star on American TV as the lead actor in ""House"", one of my favorite shows, and Fry is an occasional supporting player in ""Bones"", another of my can't miss broadcast offerings. On the product under discussion, you can see pretty much where they got their television start, beginning about 20 years ago as a sketch comedy duo. For my taste, the earliest work was the most enjoyable, and the other three DVD's were a bit less worthwhile as a whole. Many of the sketches are of interest mainly to people living in England at the time they were created. Some of the others suffer from my not being at the top of my game in comprehending British accents or slang. The great moments are indeed, worthy of that word. I did have many, many laughs, but for repeated enjoyment of the talents of these two fools, I recommend the ""Jeeves and Wooster"" box instead. Or, you could rent the human-actor version of ""101 Dalmatians"" and see Hugh Laurie as a bumbling burglar who makes his brief appearance into a real gem. Also see J.C. Clark's review here, which makes some excellent points about the pros and cons of ""complete box sets"" like this.",1198108800,2,1270,4.5021645021645025
2652689,5,B000I2IP2K,"I cant see how a comedy fan, especially of cutting edge British humour can avoid these two clowns. At their best they are just supremely silly and possess a Python Silliness Reciprocal Coefficient Constant (PSRCC) of 0.987 which is the 3rd highest rating recorded in this part of the milky way since the early 17th century. For this achievement alone these two little rascals should be knighted and put in cold storage for further medical examination. We must as a species, find out what exactly this genetic abnormality is in a philosophical and sexual sense and how to harness its potential to combat the looming crisis of global warming. Its the only hope we have left to us now...............",1194566400,8,696,4.857142857142857
2652690,4,B000I2IP2K,"It is hard to imagine any sketch comedy series generating 5 stars. Who could maintain that level across such a format? The greatest bits from Cook and Moore, or Monty Python, would be a 5, or even 6, star collection. Unfortunately, there is more to both teams than their best bits. Since we have so little of Pete and Dud, it's hard to say. But with Monty Python, there were hours of unwatchable junk. Sorry, folks, it is true. However, when they were on, they were exquisite. Sublime, funny, and philosophical, with a clever and biting humor that took your breath away. There is a reason we know the words to the Cheese Shop sketch 30+ years later; it was entrancing. I remember watching that sketch when it was new; I knew right away this was more than just funny.

Nothing in this set rises to those miraculous heights. Thankfullly though, nothing sinks to the dregs so common on the MP show either. This is hours of clever and witty stuff, with lots of laughs all over. The music is especially well done. Yet too many laughs are supposed to come from the use of naughty words, or Hugh and Stephen dressed as women. The naughty words are not necessarily funny, nor are men shrieking in women's clothing. (See way too many MP sketches for examples.) Overall though, there are plenty of excellent sketches, well delivered and well acted. (The supporting cast is often astounding.) As others have said, the laughs do decline badly in Series 4, and we can only be grateful they hung it up then.

So, nothing that makes you say ""That was ****ing brilliant!"" but plenty to make you say ""That was fun."" That's solid four star stuff.",1193788800,16,1628,4.571917808219178
2652691,5,B000I2IP2K,"A Bit of Fry and Laurie was, and still is, a sketch show like no other. Sketches were often abandoned with a fourth-wall break, because there was no other way out. Big laughs were often put off in lieu of a series of quick-witted verbal exchanges; the amount of word play is almost exhausting, and you really don't catch most of it until the third or fourth time through. It's the only sketch comedy show I know that gets better each time you watch it, making it fully worth buying in a set like this. My only complaint about the set is its presentation; realizing that A Bit of Fry and Laurie doesn't have a huge fan base in the United States, the package design is simply the four individual seasons put into a slip case. It works great, and I don't really have any complaints about that, but I would think it a better use of materials to have used slim cases or a fold-out case, like Lost or Heroes.
Otherwise? Brilliant material from two brilliant men.",1192579200,3,956,4.376404494382022
2652692,5,B000I2IP2K,"I'm so glad to see this get a release in the USA so that our cousins across the pond who maybe only know Hugh Laurie from House get to see what a brilliant comedian he is.

For longtime UK fans of Fry and Laurie like myself, it's a little suprising that Hugh ended up the household name in the States rather than Stephen Fry, who was seen as the real genius in that pairing. But it's not the first time that's happened  - exactly the same thing occured with the greatest comedy British double act of all time in Peter Cook and Dudley Moore. Cook was a comedy genius - probably the greatest comedian the UK has ever produced  -but it was Dudley who broke the USA bigtime and became a Hollywood star.

It's so great to see these hilariously inventive and funny sketches again - and I do hope Steve and Hugh get together again soon for some more inspired lunatic genius.",1192233600,4,867,4.300613496932515

2652696,5,B000I2IP2K,"In retrospect this DVD collection is the purchase I wish I had made. Having shelled out for all 4 series of 'A Bit of Fry & Laurie' individually, each one more hilarious than the last, I recommend that comedy fans simply invest in this 4 in 1 pack.

Throughout these fantastic series, Stephen Fry's wit and Hugh Laurie's whimsy never fail to hit the spot. The pairing like to mock everything that the eighties held dear including ruthless black hearted capitalism, vulgar fashion sense and the incumbent Tory government. Allied to the ruthless satire is the pair's amusing habit of toying with and manipulating the English language in a hilarious manner. Far from trying to escape their upper class, Oxbridge backgrounds, they instead choose to embrace them as fully as possible.

Many American viewers will have come to Hugh Laurie through his part in the series 'House' and possibly could have come to Stephen Fry through the part he played in the American series 'Bones'. To these Americans I say that it is an absolute must for you to look through all the past works of these two comic masters. As well as this series check out 'Jeeves & Wooster', 'Blackadder' and the many books that Stephen Fry has published. As far as this series goes, don't hesitate, make this all in one box set your one 'A Bit of Fry and Laurie' purchase.",1185148800,35,1333,4.6923076923076925
2652697,5,B000I2IP2K,"OK, this is based off the UK release, so I can't give you any details on features, etc. Instead, I'll focus on the series.

First, if you don't already know, A Bit of Fry and Laurie is a collection of sketches divided by mock interviews with the ""British public"" (always Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie). At times these sketches are of characters, whilst other times they are of the stars as themselves.

Vox pops abound in every series of A Bit of Fry and Laurie, but there is a lack of regular, recurring characters (unless you count Fry and Laurie), unlike in Little Britain. In series one and two, there are Tony and Control of MI6, and the promotors of Uttoxeter, and the like, but if you've seen those two series, you'll understand why they were dropped from three and four. (I won't go into too much detail on one and two; I'll assume you've already seen them.)

Series three introduces Mr Music (Hugh Laurie) who plays out the credits as Stephen Fry mixes up a strange, often disturbing, concoction. This bit, thankfully survives in the final series. Series three also marks a spike in music sketches (even Fry contributes his bit, as frightening as it seems in ""You, You, You"", etc.), including the popular ""There Ain't But One Way"", in which Laurie plays a Johnnie Cash-like singer with his brother Oren. I don't think you'll ever see Stephen Fry in a more unsophisticated role. By and large, this is my absolute favourite series, and my friends agree. Three hours just flew by.

Series four is... a tad awkward. Apparently, the programme was moved from BBC2 to the more restrained BBC1 (I may be wrong on the channels), where creative control was hampered by the station. They introduced (often) unnecessary guest stars who did not do much -- most of the funny sketches were done without them. Thankfully, Mr Music and Fry's disturbing concoctions are back, and even more disturbing than before. And for you fans of Hugh Laurie, he does a music sketch every episode, including ""Little Girl"" and the ""Be Nice"" rap.

All in all, this is a must for fans of Fry and Laurie, and an excellent introduction for new fans who are just discovering their comedy.",1179878400,75,2158,4.668421052631579
2652708,1,B000I2IP2K,"Somehow, I just didn't find this show all that great.  I own over 20 box sets of British comedies, from Monty Python onwwards, and this is one set I can truly say I regretted buying.  I don't know what it is, I just found it boring, and repetitive beyond belief.  I like Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie, so when I got this, I guess I was expecting more.  I think I only really laughed out loud twice while watching the entire series.",1417478400,2,429,4.195121951219512
2652709,5,B000I2IP2K,"Very clever British humor. Lots of wordplay, It helps to turn on the sub-titles so you don't miss anything. Many of the made-up variations of words are laugh out loud. These guys are one of the greatest comedy duos ever.",1412294400,,220,4.525

2652712,4,B000I2IP2K,"Overall, a very entertaining series; despite an increasing reliance on scatological ""humor"" as it progresses. The songs, whether performed by Fry and Laurie as ""The Bishop and The Warlord"", or solos by Laurie satirizing specific stars or styles of music were particularly enjoyable; likewise the ""man/woman on the street"" bits. Not quite as absurdist as Monty Python, a bit more pop-culture-linked than ""Not Only...But Also""; but definitely good value for your British humor entertainment expenditure. If you liked them in ""Jeeves and Wooster"", you'll like them in this; and if you haven't seen them in ""Jeeves and Wooster"", you'll need to add that to your list of things to see.",1397779200,2,679,5.181818181818182

2652715,2,B000I2IP2K,"I have to confess that Eng. (esp. the British one) is not my first lingual. If you are native British, you may think different. The second thing I have to confess is I was 3-4 years old when A Bit of Fry and Laurie was first broadcast. That the sitcom was a sketch comedy depicting the hilarious stuff in first to mid 80s Britain is, I finally find, a bit out of context of my understanding. There are many conversations, which I know it is supposed to make me laugh like crazy, sadly I cannot laugh as planned.

Unlike Blackadder, which was making fun of history, A Bit of Fry and Laurie was about contemporary, which makes it frozen at a particular time and space frame, and we may have to let it stay there.

But their act and responses were good!!!!! which I can by no means find in actors of our time, in 21 century.",1382832000,,821,4.222929936305732

For instance, it was made clear that the only DVD ""extra"" in this package was the full Footlights Review that won the Perrier Award.  Lots of bits of amusing nostalgia.",1381536000,3,435,4.917808219178082
2652717,5,B000I2IP2K,"How do you summarize a show like this one? Maybe you don't. For better or worse, some reviewers have compared it to Monty Python. The verdict's still out on that, unless it is a reference to the random formatting of the show through the years.

They lampooned, they parodied, they attacked...but they usually did it without ruffling a hair out of place, and they only seldom swore compared to some of the pure stand-up figures of history. The few moments they spent on screaming fits or foul language are mostly so well-timed that they just made the big picture even funnier. There is something intriguing about a duo that can do such busy things without losing composure or having a fit of camera shyness even once. It seems that the ridiculousness of their comedy style was invented for their own amusement, and all the better if some people laughed on the right part of the joke. Some people have complained that the show feels dated now. Well, yes, that's becoming true with each passing year, but these sketches are still heaps less topical than many other shows of this era. Many of the skits are based so much on ""verbal frotting"" (to quote Fry) that this factor is quite forgivable.

The writing is typically very smart - it's certainly not exclusionary in the MENSA fashion, but viewers who excel at public debating, writing, or simply read their brains out will really enjoy the subtleties. The way the scripts are delivered is proof positive of just how smart Fry & Laurie are (perhaps a little too smart, since it was later revealed that both of them have dealt with severe mood problems). At the same time, the ""vox pops"" and occasional fits of completely random lines or sketches - Tony Inchpractice for one -  save the show from becoming snobbish. The on-stage music you find in some episodes is not variety show music but rather a parody or ""silly song,"" and even these portions are amusing in some way (Hugh Laurie really shines in these moments of fusing his music and comedy skills together).

I will admit that the show is a mixed bag in some ways. I hardly laugh at all for the ""Tony & Control"" bits, but love so many other characters (check out the unapologetic take on ""Oprah"") that I choose to simply skip over the less funny parts instead of rip them apart in an Amazon review. I'm not saying that these actors or their show is infallible, but I *am* saying that it's not worth bashing the entire series just for a few less-than-golden moments.

As a fun bonus, season 2's disc also has the lengthy ""Cambridge Footlights Revue"" episode that Fry and Laurie did together in the early 1980s (look for the excellent tribute to ""Dracula"").",1381276800,,2659,4.6369426751592355

The sketches themselves can be hit or miss overall,  but there are still a couple of real gems-- my favorite is a short but incredibly funny bit in the last season, in which Stephen Fry is chopping vegetables & attempting to make a salad while trying to pleasantly discuss his evening of going to the theater with the viewer-- I won't spoil the fun, but he gets unexpectedly & explosively angry out of the blue, then smoothly goes back & forth between the outbursts of anger & his more quiet & polite theater-talk mode.  This sketch is my favorite Stephen Fry bit of all time, outside of his ""General Meltchett"" harangues in ""Blackadder IV"" (and of course his incredibly loud & abusive Gen. Nelson in ""Blackadder III"", in which he got to slap Hugh Laurie around!). The last season is probably the best-- also love it when Hugh Laurie does his Python-esque ""pepper-pot""-ish drag character,interfering with the man-on-the-street (or should I say, ""woman""-on-the-street) interview with a pre-""Mrs. Stephen Fry"" character (Fry's alter-ego on Twitter as his fictional beleaguered wife & inept mother of their fictional children-- see ""Mrs. Stephen Fry's Diary"", which was published in book form as a collection of his/""her"" collected tweets!

But Fry and Laurie throw in quite a bit of highbrow or outright intellectual humour, with sketches referencing everything from De Saussure's distinction of ""langue"" and ""parole"" in linguistics to Plato's notion of forms and the commonplaces of the Tolkien-style fantasy genre. Sometimes we find metacomedy, where a sketch is interrupted halfway through, and the comedians address the camera, or we even cut to another sketch where Fry and Laurie play critics analysing the last. The comedic dynamic is based on the opposition of these two comedians, with Laurie the often scatterbrained funny guy and Fry the prim straight man. Both Fry and Laurie are quite talented in imitating other English accents, from Australian to Scottish, although only Laurie successfully manages American and working class UK accents. With many of the sketches are perennial, others are very much if its time, capturing the political polemics, celebrity scandals, ""Yuppie"" phenomenon and popular music of the time. Far from making it unpleasantly dated, in my experience these facets only add to the humour.

I think the first season is the strongest, and then the quality progressively declines. From the second season everything seems too glossy and contrived, with the beginning episodes had a sort of amateur charm to them. We get too many of Hugh Laurie's musical sketches, some of which aren't even comedic anymore. In the final series, guests appear on each episode, which pushes Fry and Laurie out of their own programme. Therein lies a conundrum, for I cannot recommand the complete DVD set to just anyone, because they may not enjoy all or even most of it. However, I cannot recommend just getting the set of the first series because then, if you like it and want to see more, it'll cost so much more to get the complete set. However, this programme is floating around out there, and I think if you previewed it first you'd have a better idea of whether the complete set or even just the release of the first series is worth it.",1244505600,32,2339,4.876884422110553
2652742,4,B000I2IP2K,I bought this for my husband for Christmas. We are big fans of Jeeves and Wooster. This is quite different but we have been enjoying these a lot. We were fortunate to have lived in UK and I think for that reason we enjoy the British humor more than some who have not been exposed to some of their unique takes on things. It is similar to Monty Python humor.,1231459200,,357,4.114285714285714
2652743,3,B000I2IP2K,"If you like British humor, this pair does a wonderful job of keeping you laughing. I still find it hard to believe that Hugh Laurie can be the harse Dr. House on American TV when he came from such comical beginnings. Enjoy.",1212969600,3,223,4.333333333333333
2652744,3,B000I2IP2K,"Gets better as it goes along, but many of the jokes and skits are, I think, parodies of British TV shows that we don't get--so, though I think they're both wonderful, Jeeves & Wooster was SO much better.",1209254400,5,203,4.368421052631579
2652745,5,B000I2IP2K,"I purchased this DVD box set after reading the scripts for this series. It does not disappoint. If you are a fan of British Comedy and/or a fan of Messrs. Fry and Laurie, you will thoroughly enjoy this box set.",1208736000,,210,4.275
2652746,4,B000I2IP2K,"Overall, this show is very enjoyable.  Some sketches are really silly and so absured (Derek Nippl-e, anyone?!), that you laugh quite hard watching them.  My favourite parts of the show were the musical numbers with Hugh Laurie, and the endings of the last two series with Stephen Fry mixing up cocktails and dancing hilariously as Laurie plays the piano.

As far as my ratings go:  Even though I'm a huge fan of British comedy, and that's basically all I buy in way of DVD collections, I found this one a bit hard to understand being a Yank and all.  This show was on air when I was about six years old as well, so I'm not sure if it's a cultural or time-lapse difference that makes certain sketches go over my head.

For a collection of four DVDs, the price is quite heafty as well.  For about the same price, you can find the 8-disk Jeeves & Wooster series in Amazon's ""new & used"" section.  What would have made the boxed set worth the price would have been a collection packed with extras (left-over sketches, bloopers, behind-the-scenes stuff, etc).  Though, the one extra this set did have was the Cambridge University Footlights Review Special that aired on the BBC featuring early works by Fry & Laurie.  This special is quite hilarious, and Stephen Fry shines, in my opinion, during a seven-minute monologue simply titled, ""The Letter"".  Very witty stuff, indeed!",1204416000,7,1372,4.675
2652747,2,B000I2IP2K,"For those used to the brilliant writing of either Jeeves & Wooster or House M.D., this series will be a serious disappointment.  Though sometimes genuinely funny, it sadly relies on profanity and sexual humor far too much of the time.",1199577600,15,234,4.85

8143631,2,B000I2IP2K,"I knew this show very well before purchasing so I would highly recommend the show to anyone who is a fan of British humor. Now the price of this box set is usually listed insanely high. Now I didn't realize unfortunately when I bought it even at a hugely discounted price, but all for seasons are available individually at a much cheaper price. The real reason why I give this such a low rating though is because when I opened the set to watch it, both season one and three will not read (I did manage to get season three to read one on my laptop after repeatedly inserting and ejecting the disc). Unfortunately by the time I had a chance to try the discs it was pass the return window that Amazon had. So if you are interested in purchasing this series check the individual seasons for a better price and try them as soon as you receive them in case the discs don't read (I've seen others comparing about bad discs)",1464048000,2,916,4.300578034682081
