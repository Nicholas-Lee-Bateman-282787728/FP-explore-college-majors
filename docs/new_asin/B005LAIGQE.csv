4719348,4,B005LAIGQE,"My wife and I were living in Barrow back in 1988 when the three California Gray Whales got stuck in the ice near Point Barrow. It was an exciting time and we were eagerly waiting to see the movie --how Hollywood would tell the story.  When the whales were first discovered, I had just started working as the newsperson for local radio station KBRW. Got busy very quickly!

It was great to see some places there again, like the Mexican Restaurant ---really named Pepes.
And young Ahmaogak Sweeney in the role of Nathan, who learns about the Inupiat Eskimos and their relationships with whales from his Appa, or Grandfather. Nathan also figures out a way to supplement his allowance when some 200 outside Media folks arrived in Barrow and wanted to get out to the Arctic Ocean ice where the whales were trapped.
He gathers up some cardboard and sells it to the reporters so their feet won't get cold standing on the ice.
I was out there on the ice and don't remember such a thing, but it might have been a good idea.

The movie is listed as ""Inspired by a True Story.""  So we were prepared for Hollywood to stretch and substitute.

Two major ones:  It was an Inupiat Eskimo hunter, Roy Ahmaogak, who first discovered the stranded whales, not a  newsman.
And second ---the Barrow whalers do not hunt the California Gray Whales. They hunt the larger Bowhead whales.
The movie includes arguments that a quick rescue was needed so the Native crews would not hunt them.
The Whaling captains held their meeting early on, before most media arrived, and said they would do all they could to rescue the whales.

One of the movie's strong points is recreating the whales, barnacles and all. And correctly showing how local people and visitors wanted to touch the whales, and sometimes encourage them to hang on.
As two of my friends who were wildlife biologists said, it provided a rare opportunity to see such whales close up.

The movie also shows how the key to the apparent rescue was low-tech ----the Natives cutting out a series of breathing holes with chain saws and then the water circulators from two caring men from Minnesota which kept the beathing holes open.  And finally the Russian Icebreaker which breaks through a pressure ridge standing between the whales and open water in leads.

Did the whales actually make it out and all the way down to their feeding areas off of California and Mexico?
The Federal official in charge declared that the survivors did. But they were not fitted with little transmitters. I'd like to think that they did. See the movie for yourself and see what you think

4719349,1,B005LAIGQE,"This is a typical Hollywood election year propaganda movie.  The socialist / communists want to destroy our economy.  One of the vehicles they have admitted to be using is the  ""Green"" environmental agenda.  By choking off the oil and pushing other economy destroying agendas they are bringing our country to its knees. This movie glorifies the communists that are responsible for the $5.00 a gallon gas we pay. It horribly and disgustingly belittles and falsely portrays the people who actually spent money and were responsible for helping to free the whales, Ronald Reagan, the oil company and the local Eskimos.  I was disgusted that I spent my money going to see this movie only to find out that I had been duped into paying Hollywood to put out another communist propaganda movie.  Last year I voluntarily spent 1,800.00 on gasoline with about 50% of that being taxes. That got me to work everyday and I it took me on vacation.  I forcibly had taken from me about $18,000.00 in taxes. What did that get me?  It was blown away by one of the Obama's million dollar vacations.  Or it was spent paying off the Hollywood hypocrites with government-funded grants to make trash like this move.  Isn't it amazing how the gas company is portrayed the big evil greedy selfish organization, when the real big selfish organization is the oversized over important socialist government. Don't waste your money on  this Hollywood propaganda junk.",1332633600,41,1436,4.892561983471074
4719350,5,B005LAIGQE,this is an awesome movie. this movie is based on a true story where three whales two adults and thier baby gets traped in the ice and fights for thier lives. when a news caster descovers that the whales are in trouble he broadcast it all over the news. when people descover how much the whales need help they help them. this was a really good movie and was heartwarming. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do,1330560000,26,426,4.2073170731707314

4719373,4,B005LAIGQE,"Based on a true story, Big Miracle is a dramedy that is hit or miss when it comes to consistency but is a lovely story. When three whales get trapped in the icy ocean off the coast of Alaska, various ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" come together to help free them. Drew Barrymore gives a solid performance as a PETA member who fights tooth and nail to get the help needed to free the whales. The movie sometimes wants to be more comedic than the story allows, but the supporting cast is really excellent and there is a chance you'll have an anxiety attack hoping they free the whales in time.

4719422,4,B005LAIGQE,"Big Miracle

 I lived in Alaska in 1988 when this movie was set and remember the whale rescue, so I naturally chose to see Big Miracle instead of double Oscar winner Iron Lady.  As much as I respect Margaret Thatcher, I really love Alaska and whales.  I am glad of my choice.
 This movie has everything that makes for a good movie.  The actors are good, but professional actors are always good, it is what they do.  The production, particularly the seamless melding of live action, animatronic whales and CGI images of eerily beautiful under the ice whale-human interaction, is excellent.  Long time collaborating writers Jack Amiel and Michael Begler have built a workable script sans the jarring clunkers that mar many family dramas.
 Director Ken Kwapis (Hes Just Not That in to You) has the key role in making this surprisingly deep family flick.  He is of course very good at the challenging technical chores involved in filming in Alaska in the winter.  (The filming was done mostly in Anchorage and Seward Alaska with additional work being done in studio facilities in Los Angeles.)  This seems faint praise but many films fail to meet this low bar.  Kwapis deals out his movie magic not just in the technical mastery he shows but also in the tiny, thoughtful things that are a result only of his intelligence and focus on making a superior film product.  Unlike other, more successful, films set in Alaska, he troubles himself to understand and reflect the culture and wonder of the last frontier.
 Kwapis hired a first time actor, John Pingayak to play Malik, an Eskimo whaling captain and grandfather.  Kwapis captures the role of the whaling captain in Inupiat society, a subtlety that lesser directors would gloss over as unimportant.  In a swift, carefully drawn scene, between Malik and his grandson, Kwapis manages to demonstrate the tension in Inupiat culture between the old ways, gentle and mystical and the new ways of high technology and the greater human world.  It takes about one minute out of a film 123 minutes long.  It is this kind of thoughtful, intelligent movie making that keeps me going back, hopes high, every week.  Kwapis shows a subtle under-current throughout the film of what we called the code of the north.  In Alaska, the environment is so harsh and dangerous that we very self consciously pull together.  Kwapis has the Eskimos, oil people, politicians and even environmentalists all working for a common goal, something outsiders often miss.
 Drew Barrymore does cute as well as any actress ever has and has done it in movie after movie.  In Big Miracle she plays a driven career woman, in this case a professional environmental activist.  She also shows fanaticism and a level of bitchiness that is pleasing and surprising in a Barrymore role.  Congrats, Drew, we didn't know you had it in you.
 Also turning in good performances are Ted Danson who leaves his smirks behind in favor of a straight dramatic effort as a powerful oilman and Kristen Bell as an upwardly hopeful LA newswoman.  Steven Root has a small role as the then governor (he in no way resembles Steve Cooper, the actual governor.)
 I liked this carefully drawn family drama very much.  The three and a half saw blade film is rated PG for some language infraction that I missed entirely.  If director Ken Kwapis committed an error, it might have been in cost control.  He spent $40 million to make Big Miracle but after seven weeks it has only brought in some $23 million at the box office.",1469923200,,3501,4.783333333333333
4719423,4,B005LAIGQE,"This is a wonderful movie with messages at many levels, and not just because ""it's about whales"".

4719446,4,B005LAIGQE,"I originally thought this would just be a standard kid aimed animal film where the good guys (usually led by a kid) overcome some money hungry bad guys to save some whales who have gotten themselves trapped and can't get back to the ocean before the water they are in completely ices over.  I wasn't expecting much, but it's actually quite well done and enjoyable.  I'm not saying there are no annoying characters or anything, Drew Barrymore probably plays the most annoying character she ever portrayed, this time as a Greenpeace volunteer who to say is extremely opinionated about everything and blind (and rude) to learning anything from the opposing side, would be a severe understatement.  I don't know what actually happened in the true story this movie is based on, but Big Miracle includes a ridiculously unbelievable scene where she jumps into freezing cold water and cuts off a shark net caught around a tail of one of the whales with ease and no freaking out at all by the whale.  The point is this is just an out of nowhere scene, it has nothing to do with the story about working out a way to get these three whales to the ocean.  But you can't fault a film overall for that, and that's pretty much the only stupid scene in the whole movie.

Spoilers - I don't know how true the overall tale and ending to the film was but it never really adequately explained why they couldn't just use explosives or something to do the same thing they wanted the Russian ship to do other than some line earlier in the film where Ted Danson's character says we'll apparently be killing off more critters if we do that. But there weren't any other critters where the ship impacted.  The film didn't really give any reasons why these three whales, who you would think should have been aware since you don't see it happening all the time, got themselves in this predicament in the first place. Was there a predator they were fleeing from, were they all trapped in these seemingly in the wrong climate shark nets that they encountered, did aliens drop them there after they were abducted, what? Marine biologists must have come up with some explanation in the decades since it happened and the movie was made that could have been suggested by characters as theories, but none are ever voiced in the film.

But overall it's a good film not where good conquers bad, as there really aren't any villains in this (a few selfish characters, motivated by their own opportunities to gain, but no bad people).",1454716800,,2493,4.611738148984198

4719564,5,B005LAIGQE,"A wonderful, true, story of a family of whales that are trapped by ice, that is quickly freezing over in the Arctic Circle. Animal Advocate - volunteer, as played by Actress Drew Barrymore and her ex-boyfriend portrayed by Actor John Krasinski, is a small town news reporter who is the first to report the story. Actor Ted Danson co-stars as an oil tycoon with a bigger heart than he thought, along with a host of Alaskan Natives and even the American and Soviet Naval Fleets work together, to try and save the captive whales. A local broadcast of the plight of the whales turned national then global..., seemingly overnight. Millions tuned in to the nightly news just to get an update of the whale status. This is an aquatic, rescue adventure that inspires, encourages and warms the heart. It is very entertaining and you will definitely be seating on the edge of your seat wondering, ""...what they will think of next?"" to try and save the whales? This single, DVD-disc, that runs approximately 1-hour and 47-minutes, is a family movie and a definite keeper for your home, DVD library, collection. Nina Kish",1427932800,2,1108,4.776041666666667
4719565,3,B005LAIGQE,"This Hollywood movie was inspired by a true event.  It is a interesting story of three ice bound gray whales and the people who came together to  a rescue them.  A solid tale, but by making it too political they interfered in the stories development.  They spent more time complaining about the people who were actually helping by building on ""their only doing it for the PR"" than being thankful the people were doing it.  The movie could have been even better by skipping that garbage which only slowed the story down.  It gave it a dragging feeling.  It was a good story that could have been so much better.  Cute Drew Barrymore came across more annoying than appealing.  Good cast.  Worth a watch",1427155200,2,699,4.564516129032258

4719569,5,B005LAIGQE,"Very good movie.  This is not a comedy, a romance, an action, or a porn.  This is a drama.  This is based on trued events.  This movie is a good movie for the soul.  Three whales (adult male, adult female, and baby) get stuck and need the help of the humans to get to open water.  Tragedy comes in three and this movie is no exception.  Just when they think they got it, something happens.  I cried at times, smiled at other times, and had a few laughs.  I was surprised to learn from my 10 year old nephew that they showed this movie in his school for whale study.  This is a good movie to sit down and enjoy with the family.",1424217600,3,626,4.016260162601626
4719570,5,B005LAIGQE,"I liked a lot this 2012 family drama and I am really surprised that it bombed at box office. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

Let's begin with the TRUE STORY. On October 7, 1988, Roy Ahmaogak, a hunter belonging to Inupiat nation, discovered three gray whales trapped in pack ice in the Beaufort Sea near Point Barrow, Alaska. During following three weeks an unprecedented effort was made to create an escape route through the ice field for the trapped whales. This effort united Inupiat community, biologists, Alaskan state authorities, federal government, Alaskan Air National Guard, at least one oil company, medias, civilian volunteers and last but not least two Soviet(!) icebreakers, ""Vladimir Arseniev"" and ""Admiral Makarov"". On 28 October, Soviet icebreakers managed finally to create a large enough path for the whales to escape. From that moment nobody saw the whales again and it was supposed that the operation was a success - even if there is no definite proof that animals actually survived.

The film mostly follows the true story, but unavoidably some things were changed. Some more drama but also humour was added - but I cannot really be more specific to avoid spoilers. MAJOR SPOILER WARNING! The element of real tragedy from the real life was kept in the film, but, unlike in the true story, here there is no doubt left about the ultimate issue - there is a happy end. After all, it is a family movie... Also, the names given to the three whales were changed - here they are known as Fred, Wilma and Bam-Bam, when in real life they were code-named Bonnet, Crossbeak, and Bone.

The main character is a fictitious local news reporter named Adam Carlson (John Krasinski). The second most important person is his former girlfriend Rachel Kramer (Drew Barrymore), who is a fanatical, ultra radical, unpleasant and slightly insane environmental activist from Greenpeace. This character was inspired by real Greenpeace activist, Cindy Lowry (a person, I believe, much saner than the one in the movie). Three most important secondary characters, all more or less fictional, are oil tycoon J.W. McGraw (Ted Dawson), Alaskan Air National Guard Colonel Scott Boyer (Dermot Mulroney), news reporter Jill Gerard (Kristen Bell) and an ambitious White House staffer Kelly Meyers (Vinessa Shaw).

The scenario is surprisingly good. The story flows very harmoniously at good pace and never gets boring. The feeling of urgency and by moments even of tragedy is always present, but nevertheless this film contains tons of good natured humor - in fact there were at least four very clever comic moments (one of which involved a giant plush whale and another one centered around a piece of cardboard and a rodeo) which totally deserved an Oscar! On another hand, this film doesn't contain even slightest touch of vulgarity (and absolutely no foul language).

For my personal taste the strongest point of this film is that there is NO bad guys. There is certainly a confrontation of very, very divergent points of view and ultimately some tough decisions must be taken which end the debate, but the makers of this film decided that everybody has his/her story to tell, which deserves to be heard. The film is not too sugar sweet and is definitely not a fairy tale. Politicians get involved not because they love whales, but to either gather points in polls or at least to avoid losing them. The oil business gets involved mostly to try to reduce the amount of flak it takes from the environmentalist radicals - but ultimately the oil tycoon catches the ""whale fever"" exactly as everybody else. Soldiers are not enthusiastic about risking their lives in a whale rescue, but once they receive orders, they carry them to the letter - with considerable risk of loss of life or limb... Some civilian volunteers have a hidden agenda - albeit not necessarily an evil one... Etc. etc.

A very strong point is an almost total absence of political correctness and left-winged propaganda - much to the contrary. The lone radical environmentalist militant is shown as somebody who is so much in favor of the animals, that she tends to forget about the rights (or even existence) of humans - and her fanatic fervor very usefully reminds, that together with some good ideas, there is also an element of intolerant extremism and even sheer lunacy in those movements. Indigenous Alaskans are also shown with some ambiguity, because even if some from the beginning try to help the trapped animals, in the beginning we can see that their traditional way of life is amongst others based on hunting the whales... In fact, many Inupiat nation people see this whole thing as a good occasion to ""harvest"" the whales - which is a polite way to say that they want to butcher them, eat them and throw the leftovers to their dogs...

In a lesser film political correctness and left-winged ideology would immediately create the oil business, military and politicians as the villains, with environment militants, indigenous Alaskans, lots of children and some journalists as heroes. In ""Big Miracle"", let's stress it again, such is not the case, because if almost everybody is a hero, there is NO villains. At all!

This film is so good that I almost managed to forget that I cannot stand Drew Barrymore (even me I don't know why - this is an irrational thing). She certainly played very well in this film.

Now, THE reason why this film didn't perform at box office, is probably that it is too serious for little children. They can of course watch it, as there is no foul language or violence - but they will not understand anything. 11-12 years is probably the minimum age for a child to really get the story. Adults and teenagers will find it entertaining, but not little children - and for a film advertised as a family movie, this is a serious problem..

All this being said, I found ""Big Miracle"" a most interesting, very original and by moments even very courageous thing. Both me and my then 13 years old daughter we had great time watching it. A recommended viewing! ENJOY!",1423094400,,6079,4.8647342995169085

Also in Alaska there are bids placed to drill for oil and a Greenpeace representative is there to battle. When the whale news spreads the locals desire to harvest them and Greenpeace pleads to let them live. The locals agree and aspire to help the whales. Soon the National Guard and Big Oil begin to work together to help the whales, the President even calls. Unfortunately, man made tech is not enough to free the whales initially.

Then Russia gets called to help. Multiple love stories, good family movie, occasional humor.  At the end some of the actual people appear in clips including a single Sarah Palin.",1422576000,,780,4.678832116788321

Drew Barrymore, once again, does a great job of acting, this time playing a woman who's out to save whales.  She's very aggressive and you learn how to appreciate that it's because she's so dedicated, so convinced it's a necessary thing.  And so it is.
  There are lots of great scenes, including helicopters that are brought in to help save the family of stranded whales, a Russian icebreaker that helps too, and a couple of guys from Minnesota who have an invention that ... well, I won't ruin it for you.
  I'd also like to thank the people who took the time to review this movie; some of them fill in some blanks and make a few corrections concerning the real incident (it is based on a true story).

I liked the film a lot for it's message, Photography is great, and the participation of native Alaskans is commendable. Decent acting, and a terrific story about saving the whales. Unfortunately, many scenes filmed inside Pepe's restaurant are archival because it burned down in 2013. A great restaurant, a sad loss.

Big Miracle me gusta porque est basada en una historia verdadera, adems, es una historia de solidaridad humana, una historia en la que se dejan a un lado las disputas polticas (entre los rusos y los estadounidenses) y se olvidan por un momento las disputas entre Greenpeace y las empresas petroleras. Es una bonita historia, para verse con toda la familia si eso se desea. En mi caso, la vi una noche de domingo, en vacaciones, con una rica cena en una clida noche, solo en la habitacin de mi cuarto, junto a la ventana. Esa es la manera en que se me antoj ver esta pelcula. La recomiendo cuando se tenga ganas de ver una bonita historia, tranquila y con final feliz, como deben de ser todas las pelculas.

The acting is fine (love John Krasinksi anyway & Drew Barrymore!) and the story is cut lean enough that the action is sustained building to the climax, while still allowing the characters to be fleshed out enough for us to care about them. Especially love the part about the two men from Minnesota who helped keep the holes in the ice open with their invention.

There is some broad acting all around from Veronica Mars, that guy from The Office or some other NBC sitcom and Drew Barrymore looking realistically unkempt from being far from Metropolis.  I wouldn't say that this movie was enjoyable - it was just okay but the closeups of the whales were nice and of course, it had me thinking of that whole Whale Wars or Whale Wh0res situation that is often on the news.  There's no money in it, just sadism and an excuse for spy ships to be in international waters despite protests by the Australian government.",1376697600,,724,4.428571428571429

We both loved it, but after re-reading the Meaning to the Poem I wrote as the real thing was happening (and also after doing more research) I came to realize that the film was ""Hollywooded"" quite a bit - including changing the names of the whales.  Still, it was a good movie and definitely deserves a slot on my Autograph Shelf (probably next to Soul Surfer, Chasing Mavericks and Invincible or elsewhere on those shelves).",1368403200,,515,4.468085106382978

It's a true story, a pretty simple story of how people and groups and countries that have strongly opposing views came together in the Arctic to save three whales that got trapped in ice. It's pro-environment in a way that makes you really appreciate the power and beauty of nature, no matter what your political views are. Drew Barrymore is great as a Greenpeace person who champions the whales; John Krasinski is extremely likable in everything he does and here, too; Ted Danson plays the oil company executive who gets into the act and nails it..everybody is good.
The setting is a small Alaska village .... really makes you wonder if that kind of wilderness will still be here in a few years...It's beautiful.
The incident happened in and takes place during Reagan's presidency, and, gosh, how time moves on.",1360972800,,853,4.809523809523809

It is easy to fall in love with these creatures and they really tug on your heart strings.

The acting and directing are very well done. Barrymore and Krasinski have great on-screen chemistry, while Danson and Bell give superb supporting roles. All-in-all a great quality movie that you will enjoy again and again.",1360886400,,588,4.653846153846154

This movie is inspired by a true story, and follows the trials of a tiny town in Alaska as they band together, to help save some whales who go stuck in the ice, along with the Eskimos, U.S. Government, National Guard, Green Peace, and even the USSR makes an appearance.  I know, unlikely bed-fellows, who end up working together to help free the whales from the ice.
I was surprised by how good this story was.  It grabbed me, got my heart even, and wouldn't let go.  And I adored the unique and different characters.  Variety in characters is so important.  And amusing dialogue, good casting, and good pacing.
This is also a pretty good family movie, though the baby whale ends up not making it.

It was one of those events that sucked people in (like that girl who fell down the well or the miner's in South America). I couldn't get the news fast enough so I had a buddy of mine create a thing called the ""Internet"" so news could be gotten quicker.  John Krazinski was quite good as was, dare I say it, Drew Barrymore. I didn't care much for Kristen Bell's character.

4720438,5,B005LAIGQE,"This was a captivating story. I liked the setting and the use of native tribes, especially showing their viewpoint. I don't know if the whales were CGI or actual filming but you can't tell the difference.

This movie presents both sides of controversial issues and then shows how people can still co-operate to achieve something no one thought possible. The adversaries are oil companies vs. Green Peace, native Eskimos vs. Save the Whales, youth vs. elders trying to teach traditional skills, politicians vs. military, U.S. vs. USSR, and news vs. egotistic media.",1357171200,,564,5.130434782608695
4720439,4,B005LAIGQE,"Sometimes it takes a film about the environmental crises to bring to the attention of the entire populace that not only MUST we do something about our bruising of our natural environment, but that when certain people take action it does indeed make a difference. This is a gently made film that gets its point across in a warmly entertaining way - and it is a true story!

Thomas Rose' book FREEING THE WHALES forms the basis for this story, adapted for the screen by Jack Amiel and Michael Begler.  Ken Kwapis directs. In brief summery (everyone knows this story by now), an animal-loving volunteer and a small-town news reporter are joined by a native Alaskan boy to rally an entire community - and eventually rival world superpowers - to save a family of majestic gray whales trapped by rapidly forming ice in the Arctic Circle.'

The cast is a large one with some actors only appearing briefly but in roles that show their professional an also their emotional support for placing this subject before the public. In the lead roles are John Krasinski, Drew Barrymore, Ted Danson and Tim Blake Nelson, but the remainder of the cast includes Dermot Mulroney, Kathy Baker, Kristin Bell, James LeGros and a fine supporting cast of Inuit actors and others.

The special effects are credible and deeply moving as the whales are released form their frozen captivity.  The film adds much to the understanding of environmental problems and how multinational efforts are necessary to tame the destructive threats to the future of our globe.

So it arrived under the tree this year for her so we'll be able to enjoy it again and again!",1356998400,,373,4.537313432835821
4720441,1,B005LAIGQE,"The Alaskan Inuits and the big oil company got together and decided it'd be the best PR if they put on a big show of trying to save the 3 whales instead of going on about their bloody business as usual. It showed the whale-killers in such an earnest, altruistic and humane light I almost wanted to start bawling at what a sad tale it was that they were *forced* with no choice but to continuously slaughter and massacre a species of beautiful animals so much more intelligent than them. What blatant propaganda.

When whale killers and an oil company start smelling like roses and heroes in a movie, you don't need to stick around for the ending, which I didn't. What a mercy that I missed it too, because I read that Sarah Palin popped her face in to suck up some of the limelight. I was already well nauseous by that point. If you care about whales & other sentient beings and propaganda kind of makes you sick, you'll want to skip this fairy tale.",1356998400,2,950,4.367231638418079

4720475,4,B005LAIGQE,"Some years ago the tiny town of Barrow, Alaska got kicked around when vampires chose it for their latest hunting ground. There may even have been a movie about it. From a more heartwarming front, Barrow, Alaska was also the site of a bunch of disparate people and corporations that came together for a wonderful cause. Were you around back in October, 1988, when rose that furor over them three California grey whales what got trapped in the ice off Barrow? The media, on a global scale, ate this story up.

Encircled by solid ice and stranded five miles away to open water. Five miles is too long for the whales to swim AND breathe underwater. Several of the Alaskan whalers favored putting them out of their misery and using them as food. Local television reporter Adam Carlson (John Krasinski), who dreams of going national, lands the story that promptly ignites a massive groundswell of support. Soon Adam and his wilful ex, passionate Greenpeace activist Rachel Kramer (Drew Barrymore), are in the middle of an epic rescue operation. Because who doesn't love whales? To quote one of the officials of the Alaska National Guard, ""It's like going out and freeing Bambi."" If it were a family of platypuses caught in ice, I wonder, would they have warmed up the Soviet icebreaker?

Back in 1988, for a brief period of time, the media descended on a tiny town three hundred miles north of the Arctic Circle (and boasting the northernmost Mexican restaurant on the planet). It's a feel-good story. I remember flashing a huge, happy grin when the whales were freed. Recall that this was when the two global superpowers, the U.S. and the U.S.S.R., were constantly at loggerheads. Excepting that one brief interlude of detente during the whale-saving campaign. In a remarkable effort, Eskimo whalers, Federal and state officials, the National Guard, the oil people, and environmentalists, and, yes, the Soviets all shelved agendas and got together in the freezing cold. That's a lot of hot coffee.

BIG MIRACLE chronicles the daunting challenges that faced the would-be rescuers and how these challenges were overcome. One example: The battered, exhausted whales only had an open pool of water from which they could draw in oxygen. Alaskan whalers applied chain saws to chop off blocks of ice to expand the pool, except that the ice reformed in such alarming pace that they were hard pressed to keep up. One solution: two oddball characters from Minnesota with an unorthodox invention.

It's a good cast that toes the line between groundedness and rampant sentimentality. Drew Barrymore and John Krasinski anchor the film, but Kristen Bell (as an ambitious reporter) and Ted Danson (as an, um, oily oil baron) provide good support. Dermot Mulroney's character doesn't get as much screen time, but his is a pretty interesting story in real life. He plays a brusque military pilot tasked with hauling a Veco barge to Point Barrow (the barge will hopefully punch thru the ice barrier). He ends up engaged in several tense phone conversations with a pretty liaison from the White House. This really isn't a romantic comedy picture, but you get the gist. And again, unlike Barrow's vampire invasion, this is a true story.

The DVD's bonus stuff:

- Audio Commentary by director Ken Kwapis
- ""Truth is Stranger than Fiction"" - the behind-the-scenes featurette, with interviews with Cindy Lowry, the real life activist on whom Rachel is based (00:12:10 minutes)

The story centers around the efforts of a small, remote town in the northernmost point in Alaska to save a whale family trapped beneath the quickly freezing ice. The story gains national and international attention and many different people from around the country converge on the town in an attempt to free the trapped whales.
The movie does a nice job in sending an environmental/work together message without being too heavy handed and preachy. There aren't too many over the top/unnecessary melodramatic conflicts and the story rightly remains centered around the efforts to rescue the whales. The performances are all good, save that Drew Barrymore is overacting a bit. This is no special effects spectacular, just a nice little movie that is enjoyable to watch and certainly family friendly.

4720888,4,B005LAIGQE,"Right off the bat, 'Big Miracle' could have been a ham-fisted environmental propaganda piece.  Instead it's a well-told reinacted story:  not over or under done, touching our heart strings with every individual and party having their own side to tell.  At first, the centerpiece is the plight of three whales stuck in the ice with the temperature and their life chances dropping by the hour.  In the details are the improbable true-life deliberations of saving those whales.  But the heart of the matter are people with their own agendas, feelings, and motivations.  The movie does a smart job of focusing on each of them and what they each do, say, and feel.

It is a true story, of course, and it all starts when an Anchorage reporter and anchorman (Krasinski) spends some time doing a human interest segment in Barrow for his local TV station.  It is by accident while shooting a young Inuit's friend doing snowmobile stunts that he discovers a displaced whale surfacing in what looks like an ice fishing hole.  As true-to-life coincidences go, his ex-girlfriend (Barrymore) works for GreenPeace, the environmental civilian force who police alleged wrong-doers on many fronts, and she becomes the prime mover for saving these whales.

As you might expect, the story goes from the Local Hero to a hot national and then international news item.  The ramifications are also national and international as it involves an oil executive (Danson), the military (headed by a colonel [Mulroney]), and The President and Vice President (who are doing everything to shore up the latter's election).  Among the center of the ice storm is the Inuit (Eskimo) community who simply preserving their traditions and their livelihood.

What I liked about the film is how well they pace their story, while they briskly take any and all the story components without confusing a family audience.  The actual news footage (done since the likes of 'Forrest Gump') is enriching, and their portrayals are wonderfully solid.  No one is close to being an Oscar contender, but the energy, personality, and the genre of this movie make you glad this is the case.  Rachel, the environmentalist, may have us on her side with her cause, but not always on the side of her character.  The oil executive may be in it for the PR, but Danson and the script keep it honest without having him twirl his moustache like a cardboard villain.

At times funny, but nearly always engaging and fair-minded, 'Big Miracle' is a fine family movie that takes an interest in human hearts and achievement as much as it does with its environmental message.",1346630400,,2603,4.917620137299771
4720889,5,B005LAIGQE,This movie was great. Very warm & it pulled at the heart strings. I remember watching about those whales on the evening news. Great flick.,1346544000,,138,4.56

4720891,4,B005LAIGQE,"This movie was good.  Its good for the whole family and just about all ages.  Drew Barrymore's character was annoying, and I don't like her to begin with.  She reminds me of annoying people that I hated growing up, so its not necessarily her fault.  The movie is fun and touching, and has a lot of great actors in it.  I just rented it, and I don't think I would ever buy it.  Rent it.",1346284800,,385,4.066666666666666

4720934,1,B005LAIGQE,"The one thing I took away from this movie is that when you market a movie for children there is no need to ramble off a list of big stars that appear in the movie because kids don't care and families will flock to your movie regardless.  I mean, had this been a film for adults you can rest assured that every TV spot would have lambasted the screen with the names Ted Danson, Kristen Bell, John Michael Higgins, Dermot Mulroney and Kathy Baker, not to mention possibly Vinessa Shaw.  Instead, we knew Drew Barrymore was frumping it up here and John Krasinski was headlining this whale extravaganza and that was it.  I know this isn't like big news or anything, but it was the only thing I took away from this blandly crafted family film that will bore your family and inspire you to do absolutely nothing.  Maybe I'm jaded since I think John Krasinski is a terrible actor who thinks he is funny and it annoys me to no end, but overall this was such a dry and clunky film that lived in clich&eacute;s, misrepresented facts (and nonsensically) and produced nothing of real merit.",1345766400,2,1078,4.48469387755102

4720936,1,B005LAIGQE,"This is NOT a combo pack! There is 1 disc included, with the Blue Ray on one side and the DVD on the other. Besides that one side of the disc is bound to get destroyed, the main purpose of getting a combo pack is because people have both Blue Ray and DVD players. This ""Combo Pack"" will do you no good when your machines are in two different locations because the destributor didn't want to spring the extra nickel for another disc.

The movie is centered around whales which is great because we all love God's creatures. So you will enjoy the movie but there are some LONG drawn out scenes that seem to be put in here just to make the movie longer. Its worth renting for the great parts especially for kids 8-12 but don't forget to keep your phone near for the added length parts of the movie. (the kids won't catch it but you will). Its not a buying type movie but worth renting.,1345420800,,597,4.102564102564102

4720939,5,B005LAIGQE,"What a heartwarming story!  It was a really great movie.  I had wanted to see it in the movies, but didn't get there.  It was worth waiting for.  How so many people worked together to save these whales was incredible.",1344816000,,217,4.35
4720940,4,B005LAIGQE,"Some of us might still remember the three gray whales trapped in ice near Point Barrow, Alaska, in 1988, and Operation Breakthrough, an international effort to rescue them. Based on a book ""Freeing the Whales: How the Media Created the World's Greatest Non-Event"" written by Tom Rose, ""Big Miracle"" follows how the stranding of three whales leads to the ""big miracle"" involving environmentalists, oil companies, the Inuit, the governor and finally, two superpowers, through the pre-internet media.

There are several narrative threads woven together. John Krasinski plays a local reporter Adam Carlson. Drew Barrymore is a Greenpeace activist Rachel Kramer. It is suggested that they were once dating but then split up. The stranded whales bring them back together. The two have nice chemistry, but more interesting is the real-life based story of Colonel Scott Boyer (Dermot Mulroney), a National Guard pilot and Kelly Meyers (Vinessa Shaw), an executive assistant for Cabinet affairs at White House. Also, two Alaskan actors John Pingayak as Inupiat whaler Malik and Ahmaogak Sweeney as his grandson Nathan steal every scene they are in.

""Big Miracle"" is a family picture, but not all happy moments. While the film has a positive message, it also does not forget the self-interested agendas of some people for saving the whales. The media extravaganza is depicted with humor and cynicism. Director Ken Kwapis (""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"") keeps the action moving with credible characters and locations (filmed in Alaska). He portrays the characters with sympathy, but not without noting their flaws.

""Big Miracle"" was not a big hit when released theatrically. I think the well-made deserves a second chance on DVD.",1344729600,,1730,5.306569343065694
4720941,4,B005LAIGQE,A wonderful 'feel good' movie about the wonder and beauty of nature and the dangers that it can fall victim to.

4721075,3,B005LAIGQE,"This movie had a lot of potential, but...just wasn't a home run.

The story line was endearing - based loosely on real events.  I have to say that as much as we hoped to enjoy this film we were surprised at the general lack of quality acting from a number of the characters.

I think that my favorite characters were the guys from MN who flew to AK to try to help out.  At the same time I was generally disappointed by Danson and Barrymore's efforts, and the young woman newscaster was appropriately annoying.  I hesitate to be too critical, but my family and I agreed that we were happy that we waited to watch this film on DVD rather than paying to see it in a theater.  And, having seen the movie, we all agreed that once was enough.  That's from my wife and I and our 13 and 21 yr old daughters.

The special effects used to show the whales were adequate and did not distract.

All in all, 3 stars is all I can manage for this film.",1344211200,8,936,4.12707182320442
4721076,5,B005LAIGQE,"I ordered ""Big Miracle"" (BD combo Disc) and it was so fun to watch.  I remember the actual event and it was heartbreaking and uplifting at the same time.  It was nice to see it played out once again.  My whole family watched this with me.  This is a wonderful movie about three whales trapped in ice and their story of how they survived with the help of so many different people.
Drew Barrymore is truly amazing in this movie,she evokes so many different emotions from her audience. John Krasinski plays the role of the original journalist that discovered to Whales plight. He really believes that he is ambitious until he meets Kristen Bells Character. The beautiful, Kristen Bell does another great job of playing a Narcissistic journalist who seems to learn how to be a bit more human. Ted Danson is wonderful, as a greedy oil baron, who also has a heart.  He just needs a nudge from his wife,(Kathy Baker) every once in a while to remember that heart. Dermot Mulroney plays the surly National Guard Pilot very well.
This is a movie worth adding to your collection.",1344124800,,1068,4.6

Mostly fun, this movie had it's drama & it never lost it's balance. Kristin Bell did a nice job & of course, it's hard to go wrong with Drew Barrymore. I especially liked how the switch between the news reporting & the story scenes seamlessly moved from one to the other. Just a great movie.

4721166,4,B005LAIGQE,"Putting aside Greenpeace and political views, this was a good movie that adults can watch together with their children.  Sex and profanity is non-existent.  The story lacks slightly in parts, however overall if you are looking for clean entertainment for the evening, you can't go wrong with this one. There are several places where discussions could be opened up for families to impress upon their children redeeming values.

I liked the fact that this was based on a true event, and while I was more than old enough at the time of the actual occurance, I had actually never heard of this story before.  This made the story all the more interesting for me as I was able to watch it unfold for the first time.

There are quite a few well known actors/actresses in this movie, but the native Inuit's really steal the show.  The grandfather/grandson team was excellent as were the main male/female reporters.

*SPOILER ALERT*
Those of you with sensitive children who might be saddened by the death of the baby whale should take note that only the parent whales survive the situation.",1342396800,,1081,4.779569892473118

4721168,5,B005LAIGQE,"What's great about it: True to life
What's not so great: Limited backstory

Heretofore I've caught my share of small land locked salmon and trout in my neighborhood lake that was used for the setting of the opening Whale Hunt scene transformed into the Beaufort Sea. I was amazed to see in the movie though that we now have (or had) a whale in our lake through the magic of CGI (computer graphic imaging.) lol

As to the movie itself, I couldn't believe all the scenes that ended up getting cut including some that were in the trailer. At least our neighborhood Jewel Lake and the whaling boat with its crew on the lake were prominently shown in the opening scenes of the movie. (Drew's performance on the lake/arctic sea as part of the back story though didn't make it.)

It looks like they chopped other parts of her back story since in the promo shots they had her wearing yellow rain gear and holding a bucket which suggested they had planned to include the episode in Tom Rose's book describing the actual Greenpeace girl's efforts to save a Beluga Whale here near Anchorage by dousing it with water when it got stuck on the mudflats. (In that real life event she was almost drowned and her boyfriend ended up saving her life. True to her character as depicted in the movie, she had insisted to her boyfriend that her dog be saved first.)

One cool thing that I was hoping might make it into the movie, and which apparently did, were some of the really neat sunsets that we had during the filming on the ice field set. When I watched those sunsets from my office window I was curious if the cameraman filming below me might try to include some. You can see one such spectacular sunset caught by the cinematographer just as the story fades from the whaling captains' meeting to the ice field set with its animatronic whale surfacing from the ice hole below.

By way of review, I thought the character playing Malik, Nathan's grandfather, put on a masterful performance worthy of a supporting actor Academy nomination. To me the funniest scene in the movie was where Malik shut up the rambling Ted Danson's character by instructing the gathered Inupiats to start cheering. Although he is a well known Alaska Native performer here, this was his first movie role. The acting overall was quite good although some additional character development would have been welcome - obviously hard to do with the large cast and varied story lines that would have required adding more time than the editors were evidently allocated.

Another piece of movie making trivia, dozens of period (1988) cars were used to circle the block during the Anchorage Greenpeace Office scene toward the end of the movie. Only a single red Pontiac survived the cutting room table as it alone was visible through the window as Drew Barrymore and John Krasinski reunited inside the office. As a point of interest, the movie makers went to great lengths to make this a true period piece from costuming to cars as noted above.

Not to be missed in the DVD and Blu-ray are the extra features which are most interesting in depicting how the movie was made here in Alaska and the true-to-life happenings that were incorporated into the film.",1341705600,,3205,4.661946902654868
4721169,5,B005LAIGQE,"Wow, our family really liked this movie.  It was amazing how so many different kinds of people with competing ""self interest"" just decided to work together for something they all wanted.  The whales plight captured the attention of the nation during the cold war.  How fitting that even that could not survive the compelling cause to save the whales.  We've watched it several times.  If you want to see a powerful gripping story that is based on real life and inspires you this is it.  Gotta see it as a FAMILY!!! Lots of positive influence of working together, finding common ground, going beyond initial commitments to do more than you promised just because it is the right thing to do.

4721244,5,B005LAIGQE,"This is a GREAT movie.  It's the most enjoyable I've seen in a while.  John Krasinski plays is exact character from ""The Office"", which is my favorite tv show.  His character works really well in this movie.  It was a heart warming magical movie.  It's also really informative.  You learn things about Greenpeace, whales, the Arctic, and Alaska oil drilling.  This movie also has a humorous aspect worked in, which makes it more light hearted, and fun to watch.",1340409600,,461,4.7594936708860756
4721245,4,B005LAIGQE,"""In Alaska there are no simple rescues."" While filming a story about a kid who can do sno-mobile tricks, reporter Adam (Krasinski) spots a strange sight. When he sends his report of three whales trapped in the ice with only days left to live it becomes national news. Now with the help of his Greenpeace girlfriend Rachel (Barrymore) and a few others the race is on to save the whales. After being totally surprised with how much I liked ""Dolphin Tale"" my expectations for this one were pretty high. Once again I was shocked by how much I enjoyed this movie. Almost immediately it sucks you in and holds you through all the highs and lows. This is also another movie that is based on events that happened when I was old enough to remember but I knew nothing about this. Not knowing what happened made the movie seem more tense to me and I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. Much like ""Dolphin Tale"" this is a great family movie that everyone, not just the kids will love. It is rated PG for language but other then a character saying Hell and bastard I don't remember anything other that that so you won't have to worry about what your kids are hearing. I highly recommend this as a great movie for family night. Overall, one of the best family movies in the last few years. A must see. I give it an A.",1339804800,8,1310,4.286290322580645
4721246,5,B005LAIGQE,"While the DVD and BLU-RAY are still preorder items here in the US, I have just viewed the added features -which we will also be getting in the U.S.- on the international version of the BLU-RAY and IMHO they alone are worth seeing.  The making of the movie feature - titled ""A 'Big Miracle' in Alaska"" is extensive (21 minutes) and truly depicts what some of us here in Alaska had a chance to witness as the film was made here.  The ice field set was unique and the use of animatronic whales (rather than tennis balls) for the human actors to relate to on the set is graphically depicted. Had to love seeing again the filming of the whale hunt scene on the lake just down the street from my house.  If you have a BLU-RAY player (or even if you don't) opt for the BLU-RAY version just to get this added feature which is apparently exclusive to the Blu-ray. On the flip side of the Blu-ray version is a DVD copy - so spend the extra 3 bucks for the Blu-ray as you can always take it to a friend's to catch the added feature.

""Truth is Stranger than Fiction"" is another added feature  - though this one is shared by both the DVD and Blu-ray which compares and contrasts the real life events with the Hollywood dramatization.  It is also worth viewing.

Anyone interested in the behind the scenes aspects of movie making will find the features on the DVD and BLU-RAY a real treat.",1339632000,,1376,4.310077519379845

4721248,5,B005LAIGQE,"1988 Barrow Point, Alaska.

This film is based on a true story and includes news feeds from that era. Three migrating whales are trapped in the ice due to early freezing. It was a fluke they were reported on in the first place. Once attention grew, unlikely forces and alliances came together to save the whales. This included an oil company, Greenpeace, US and Soviet governments, the military, Eskimos, the community, private entrepreneurs, and a Barbie reporter. That was the Big Miracle.

The film contains the right mix of drama and comedy in this heart warming tale on what people can accomplish when they come together.

The end of the film shows a clip of Sarah Palin, then Heath, as a sportscaster.
