8431282,5,B004IVNICE,"Moving character study, the kind of small movie studios don't make any more.  Two ordinary people in a marriage begin to reacquaint themselves with each other after a series of tragic losses and disappointments.  Both learn more about themselves as well as about each other in the process, but gently and indirectly. The scene in Europe where the husband revisits the site of a war experience made me cry.  One of the best movies about marriage and family that I've ever seen.  The performances by Martin Balsam, in a rare leading-man role, and Joanne Woodward are superb and should have garnered them Oscars.",1500768000,,609,4.883495145631068
8431283,5,B004IVNICE,"Summer Wishes, Winter Dreams starring Joanne Woodward was released in 1973. It is a great soap opera all the way. Wonderful support by Sylvia Sidney. A study of a dysfunctional marriage and family.  Fans of Joanne Woodward will like this the most.",1450051200,,247,4.880952380952381
8431284,5,B004IVNICE,They don't make movies like his anymore! Great cast-especially Sylvia Sidney who steals the show as per norm! A real look into life and whats it all about anyway? I would recommend this picture.,1437868800,,194,4.735294117647059
8431285,4,B004IVNICE,"This is an exceptional drama about a woman struggling to come to terms with the course of her life.  It crackles with an intelligent and artistic energy, leavened by her sarcasm and deep sense of grief.  I was utterly absorbed by it, to the point that I thought about the course of my own life and choices.

Woodward is a woman who has faced a series of disappointments, in her children, her husband, and family.  With the exception of her sensitive husband, none of them appreciate her struggle with a stalled marriage and dysfunctional children.  Though banal, it has an air of tragedy to it, with Woodward makes pressingly real with some of her finest acting.

Recommended warmly.  This is an excellent indie film.",1416614400,2,717,4.733870967741935

8431287,5,B004IVNICE,"Summer Wishes, Winter Dreams is a showcase for the talent of Joanne Woodward. However, there are two other actors in the film who hold their own just as well, being Martin Balsam as the silent, suffering husband and Sylvia Sidney as the over-bearing mother. When Sylvia Sidney's character dies suddenly, Joanne Woodward's character is left to assess her loss as well as her marriage to her husband. There is also  the strained relationship with her married daughter to contend with as well as her concerns for her homosexual son. This movie deals with all this and more in the span of 90 minutes and does it brilliantly. The script is economical and the performances are pretty much perfect. Why Woodward and Sidney didn't win Oscars for their performances here is a mystery.",1402963200,6,775,4.871212121212121
8431288,5,B004IVNICE,"I purchased this movie because I caught the ending on TV.
It took a minute to get it, but I was so NOT disappointed.
This movie was made for a slow Sunday afternoon. I really
enjoyed it, and I'm so glad it is mine for all Seasons.",1303776000,12,230,3.9148936170212765
