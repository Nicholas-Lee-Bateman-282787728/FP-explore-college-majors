8165028,3,B000LXGV1I,This would have been a terrible movie (and an unwatchable one) without SRK--but he's always so interesting to watch that it's bearable.,1405555200,,135,5.181818181818182
8165029,2,B000LXGV1I,My brother just watched this film before I had a chance to watch it and said not to be fooled by cover of this dvd because Shah Rukh Khan is not in the movie nor are any of the other actors on the cover! He said it looks like a 1970's film and someone just put that picture on cover to sell it as a Shah Rukh Khan film. He thought it was still a good film but it is not a Shah Rukh movie at all. COVER OF DVD IS VERY MISLEADING. I bought it while searching for movie's with Shah Rukh Khan name on it and this one came up.,1381968000,,521,3.6607142857142856
