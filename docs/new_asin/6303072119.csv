7837364,4,6303072119,"An interesting look at the gay lifestyle in Japan.  Satoko is a young woman who befriends a gay couple, Goh and Tochi.  She allows them to use her apartment for their trysts so that they will not be discovered by Goh's mother or Tochi's wife.  This idyllic arrangement cannot last forever.  All three characters go through trying times until the sweet resolution in which Satoko and Goh set up their own little family.  Gays face enormous pressure from society in all cultures, but it is particularly interesting to see how this plays out in Japan, a culture which exerts enormous pressure on all of its people to conform.",1001548800,3,622,4.722222222222222
7837365,5,6303072119,I have seen this movie so many times.  The strange relationship of a gay couple and a female (okoge) is truely sentimental.  This story does reflect the truth of gay males in Japan lively.  They are coming out more though.  I love the screen of drug queens fought against guys who made fun of them.,948758400,4,298,4.363636363636363
7837366,3,6303072119,"The first part of the movie is lovely.  The relationship between the two men is very well done.  Midway, however, the story comes apart.  The portrayal of gay life in Japan probably reflects the tradition and cultural  morays of the time meaning that gay relationships are seen as doomed from  the start.  The ending leaves one desiring a more fulfilling happy ending  for gay couples.",946598400,3,385,4.8307692307692305
