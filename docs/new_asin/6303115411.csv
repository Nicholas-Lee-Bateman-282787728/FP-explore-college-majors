7838491,3,6303115411,"Just saw this movie last night and I had NEVER seen it before. That is unusual because I thought I'd seen all the old movie westerns. I enjoyed it. The performance by Dan Duryea is wonderful. He is usually plays a nasty, even pyscho, villain but here he starts off as a mild mannered, preacher nerd and is very convincing. The scene where he hesitantly and awkwardly kisses the girl is so realistic. The dream of a ""sand sailing"" boat is highly unusual for a western. When Duryea turns into the same kind of killer he disparaged the actor is back in his element and kills without conscience. The ending is a surprise and I won't give it away, but it's ""the law of the west"".",1468108800,2,674,4.357142857142857
7838492,4,6303115411,"THE BOUNTY KILLER is a truly great low budget Western. Everyone gives it their best shot. Duryea, Dalton, and Cameron are terrific, and spotting all the older cowboy actors is great fun. For the most part, this is a well-made film which does its best to overcome its budgetary restrictions, although there are still some instances of rather cheap sets and a horribly unreal background cyclorama of ""the great outdoors"". The story is solid. The music by Ronald Stein is superb, especially the main title which ranks right up there as one of the great majestic Western film themes of all time. All in all, a very enjoyable film. However, both VHS transfers I've seen of this film are rather poor. The one on American Home Entertainment (the box art features the title at the top, and a shot of Dan Duryea on a horse)has the better color of two, but has some horrible problems on the soundtrack. For whatever reason, some rock music starts to bleed through at some points, sometimes loud enough to become quite distracting. The version on the VCU label (big face on the box, the title THE BOUNTY KILLER at the bottom) does not have this sound problem, but the color isn't as good. Both versions are unfortunately pan and scan. This movie is certainly deserving of a new DVD or BluRay transfer with good color and in its original widescreen format.",1326153600,2,1344,4.675105485232067
7838493,5,6303115411,"This movie was first released in 1965(1994) in full screen, technicolour and runs 92 minutes. The sound and picture are good. The film starts in silverlady saloon where miner Hank Willis says that the future was in silver under the ground and asks Carol Ridgeway (AUDREY DALTON) to sing. Willie Dugan (DAN DURYEA) walks in Silver Creek, all dressed in black, having had a long ride on the stage and orders a large mug of ice cold water. Willis starts a fight with Dugan because he tried to talk to Carol. Jonny Leam (ROD CAMERON) buts in to stop this and has to shoot Willis. Leam takes Dugan to his room and Dugan claims he has not seen a man killed before. Leam gives Dugan a gun and leaves. He also says that there could be law in the books, but around here men carry it on their hips. Now Dugan looks for a job. He takes a job transporting payrol on horses. He was also told that there were many outlaws who would want to get hold of this payrol. He and Captain Luther are ambushed by Jim Sutton and his gang and Dugan manages to shoot them all and collects $250/- reward and gets a new outfit. They decide to collect more money by becoming bounty hunters. They approach the local sheriff and find out who needs collecting, but the sheriff thinks that they were 'both soft in their heads'. They decide to go after Mike Clayman (BUSTER CRABBE), one of the worse, who was in New Mexico territory. Marshall Davis warns them about Clayman. Dugan and Luther handcuff Clayman and try to ride back to Silver Creek. On their way Clayman tries to bribe them with $500/- reward money, to save them trouble. 3 of Clayman's men follow them.
How will it end? Will Dugan and Luther succeed in taking Clayman back for the $500/- reward? What will Clayman's men do? What has happened to Carol? Will the bounty hunters become bounty killers?

7838494,5,6303115411,"This is a truly great movie.  Seeing Dan Durea as a preacher turned bounty hunter seeking revenge for the death of his friend is awesome. This mild mannered guy faces down the worst of the worst outlaws and in doing so, becomes one himself.  The movie has many twists and turns (I won't tell you the ending).  Definately, a ""B"" Western but has the makings of a cult film.  Highly recommended.  I wish it were out on DVD but I will settle for video for now.  However, make sure you get a good copy.  During some parts, there is some strange music dubbed in that is clearly not supposed to be there - perhaps just a bad batch.  If you get one, send it back and get a replacement.",1109980800,11,677,4.1937984496124034
