2458378,4,B000CDG5MW,"Guess I was a little prejudiced against this movie - while watching I was trying to figure out all that ""gratuitous violence"". But all in vain - it wasn't gratuitous. ""Murder-Set-Pieces"" is indeed shocking, disturbing, brutal and relentless, but it's in no way an exploitation film. It seemed to me Nick Palumbo's flick was a serious and at the same time mercyless insight into a serial killer's mind. And it was rather thorough. Maybe first since William Lustig's ""Maniac"". Actually ""Murder-Set-Pieces"" can be seen as a homage to many horror classics, first of all ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" comes to mind after sequences in the killer's den with all the carcasses and other human remains. And not just ""Texas Massacre"", but the main impression Palumbo's film gives is of a ""Maniac's"" traditions continuer. They are very similar in many ways. ""Murder-Set-Pieces"" is utterly atmospheric and it could have been even more, had Palumbo left in all the cut footage of driving through the streets of Las Vegas. By the way city theme is extremely important here as in ""Maniac"". In Lustig's movie New York acted like an individual actor influencing maniac's mind, making him descend deeper into madness. Here Las Vegas is doing the same thing, we see this huge city of million lights and crowds of people as an empty place. Is it possible to feel yourself alone in the crowd? According to Nick Palumbo - yes, it is. And those Vegas suburbs look like a completely desolated and abandoned places. And it seems that people are not people at all, they are just some kind of cardboard setting. It's amazing what an atmosphere Palumbo created here so that we could think and feel the same things as his serial killer - desperation, anger, pure rage towards the whole humanity. And violence in ""Murder-Set-Pieces"" is not self-sufficient. It just helps to create the mood for the movie and to try to touch something that's unsane. By the way very good is the contrast between ghastly murder/torture scenes and blank, almost sterile-white and beautifully-shot sequences of photo-sessions.

Just try to imagine William Lustig's ""Maniac"", but more explicit, graphic and shocking. We even see children being slain here which is not a common thing in cinema as we all know. But again these scenes' purpose is not just to shock the audience but to demonstrate all the depth of a man's insanity. And to show the striking difference between glamourous and shiny exterior of the City and its rotten and dark core. Nick Palumbo manages this goal as perfect as it is just possible.

""Murder-Set-Pieces"" turned out much better than I expected, being much more than your regular slasher gory flick. And I'd mark small roles by some prominent men of the genre - Tony Todd (""Candyman""), Gunnar Hansen and Edwin Neal (""Texas Chainsaw Massacre""), Fred Vogel (""August Underground"").

Don't listen to anybody and don't believe any hype. Don't make up your mind regarding this film on what you heard about it. See it yourself. It's worth your viewing. And it definately is worth being in a collection of anyone who is interested in horror genre.",1167782400,6,3109,4.929389312977099
2458379,1,B000CDG5MW,"I don't usually complain about bad horror films or bad films at all, but this one is too much like a snuff film that it is worthy of warning to anyone who reads about it and is curious. Watching it may anger you and may make you feel really disgusted. It is sadistic, plain and simple.

An excerpt from Dennis Harvey's review in Variety is straight on accurate:
""Determined to offend as much as possible, he includes not just gratuitous 9-11 footage, but also a sequence featuring a crying, hysterical toddler clutching Mommy's savaged corpse... For the record, makers boast they were turned down for processing by two major film labs. Management for Cerina Vincent (in a nudity/gore-free role toward the end) has purportedly denounced the finished product. Los Angeles opening was supposed to be picketed by a Christian group, though their announcement bore suspicious signs of a publicity stunt. In what one assumes is a delightful jape, executive producers credited include 'Herman Goering.'"".

How many takes did they do to get the shot they needed with this baby? A ""baby"" because it is still using a crib and basically can walk on its own.

And people who have posted in forums online think that three film labs banning production of the film is cool...yet their posts indicate that they have not viewed the film. I can appreciate their being fans of splatter-horror. I think they should be forced to watch it and then take the same amount of money they wasted on the crappy movie and donate three times the amount to their local rape crisis center.

These filmmakers, a label to be taken lightly here, could likely be listed near Gaspar No, Virginie Despentes and Rmy Belvaux. I've seen films by all three filmmakers, by the way, and completely abhor the violence depicted within the shallow story plots.

The offensive material depicts violence very plainly without enough plot that it is completely stupid and the World Horror Convention people who were running the films left the room to us few, even an audience member was left to fix the DVD when it jumped BACK to earlier scenes. Three times this happened. It was a nightmare in itself that this film would not end soon enough. I am surprised that more people did not walk out. I was the only woman that stayed for it. There were about 5 people, not including myself, remaining in the room right up to the ending.

Walking home, I felt completely affected by the filmmakers complete insensitivity to their depiction of violence towards children. To them it may be just ""pretend"" and ""fun."" The shock factor exceeds the extreme and its exploitative nature is not justified with any type of psychological exploration into the characters nor any kind of story involving an investigation into the missing victims of this maniac. At least the films made by the other filmmakers I mentioned had some story involving an investigation.

If you enjoy gore and psychological impacts of violence witnessed by children, I recommend instead of this, the Showtime series ""Dexter.""

Scenes with children; one with a baby that you can tell is scared to hell for real. two scenes where the killer litterally f@@ks people to death. this is a classic with many tributes to true horror and that is brutal but you will laugh at scenes. It also has scenes where semantics are argued. just get it, and if you don't ""get"" the movie... you probably found this film by accident.

Your first thoughts after watching the movie is, its over? but then afterwards you think about the absolty grostique thoughts and actions this movie took. I won't give out any seens in the movie but people will be expecting crazy blood splatter and other horribal things. Yes you will get it and No you won't get it. you will because there are some pretty horrific parts in the movie now that I review it in my head..but theres also not as much gore as people said there was. This movie really is the basis of all horror films that go into the mind of a serial killer. if any director wants to make a movie like that then they should def. check this movie out becasue its a perfect example of what one does (or possibly does) on his free time or not free time. go and get this movie you won't be disappointed.",1164931200,,855,4.219512195121951

The violence is quite extreme and contians rape that makes Last House and I Spit on your Grave look like a G rated movie. The music is really good and has some good atmosphere. That Tony Todd scene is class. Its not as violent as I hoped but its still very violent and disturbing to watch.

I don't know why this film gets slammed. I've noticed that nearly every film thats entertianing these days get critized. If your a fan of gore, sadistic violence and really good and well done classic slasher moments then MSP is a worthy film to check out.",1150502400,5,711,4.227941176470588

2458388,5,B000CDG5MW,"What can said about Nick Palumbo's that hasn't already been said in hushed circles and in angry crowds of anti-violence advocates. First, the movie itself was done with such an artistic touch that it not only caused this controversy and made the director (Nick Palumbo)  go into hiding for years, that the movie itself was banned outright, and the negatives burned by the production company- now that's a sign right there you're in for a special treat! Secondly the special Effects are provided by none other than the sick Bastads at Toe Tag Pictures (now Toe Tag Inc.), these are the people who brought us August Underground, Maskhead, and other terrific sickie delights.
  Now let's get into the movie shall we, it's based around the God son of a Nazi war hero from WW 2 who is simply known as ""the photographer"" and he gets off on snuff films and killing hookers. He takes pleasure in torture, mutilation and every other  sick thing you can seriously couldn't think of unless you were Ted Bundy.",1414540800,,998,4.718390804597701

2458391,5,B000CDG5MW,"The first time I saw this movie, it was the lame 83-minute Lion's Gate version. That version isn't even worth watching. It's so chopped up that a lot of scenes keep you wondering what the heck happened. One reviewer said that ""it's like watching a porn movie with no porn in it."" Really, the only reason to watch a movie like this in the first place is for it's shock value. The 91-minute director's cut does deliver quite a bit of gore, which is the only saving grace for this movie, since there virtually is no plot or rhyme or reason as to why the killer is doing what he's doing. Still, even though the 91-minute version gives us the gore we are looking for, you can tell that some scenes are heavily edited. Like another reviewer has mentioned, you hardly ever see him actually commit the torture of the victims. Mostly, we just see the aftermath (except the chain-saw scene at the end). Like, if i see a woman tied to a chair with solid blood from her nose to her toes, I'd kinda like to know how she got that way! The original run of this flick was 105 minutes. So the ""uncut director's cut"" STILL has FOURTEEN MINUTES cut from it. Forteen minutes is a LOT of time. A lot can happen in 14 minutes. That's half of a Twilight Zone! Actually, a little more than half if you exclude commercials. The most disturbing aspect of this movie, IMO, is that they include kids in the middle of all this gore. When they start killing kids, that pretty much pushes me past my limits. All in all, I still would have to give the movie a thumbs up for the gore/shock they give is in the director's cut of this movie. By the way, in case you haven't noticed, in the specs above on this movie, Amazon shows this to be the 105 minute version. That is very misleading and is causing people to waste their money thinking they are getting the full version. I don't think the 105 minute version even exists anywhere on dvd. If it does, I've never seen it.",1399507200,,1938,4.297814207650274

i'll admit, the first time i watched this film i had to stop it at around 44: 30 simply because i was sleepy and caught off guard. after the second time i got through it, keeping in mind, it is only a horror film and a vicious one at that. this is one of those horror films only for those whom are tired of the endless array of remakes and/or are fed up with american b-horror starring washed up/burned out 1980's actors needing the $$$ to survive< girls gone dead is a prime example.

i am one of those horror fans from the 1980's whom started off with f13th, elm st., troma and evolved into clive barker<hellraiser/lord of illusions. but over the years i have been illuminated by the likes of eli roth, ryan nicholson, adam green takashi miike', etc. and olaf ittenbach, andreas schnaas and similar.

please keep one note in mind, if you choose to go my route, be patient with these european online stores/companies, sometimes you could be waiting up to 3 weeks to a month or more for your orders to arrive and days for reply's to be answered.

sinerama is a one person operation(poland) and another world entertainment(denmark) is great but very strict concerning customer attitude/behavior, neither of these merchants/companies are required to do business with anybody here in the states, it is a privilage to buy from them. both sites only sell uncensored/adults only films from around the world.

i only buy from them, due to the market censorship via the mpaa<aw shucks! and what american sites cannot/refuse to carry for sale<not including amazon for whom i still love shopping with.

if these companies are too difficult to deal with than you can try diabolikdvd and just request it, be patient, but also be prepared for a copyright limitation refusal.

2458402,4,B000CDG5MW,"Considered my many to be one of the most controversial & visceral films ever made, Palumbo's one-way ticket to Hell is a brutal ride indeed. Of course, there are films out there which have quite the reputation as being the most revolting horror films ever made guaranteed to satisfy even the seasoned horror fan who thinks he's seen everything & M-S-P gets my vote as the ""video nasty"" of our time.

I'm not referring to those who believe they're hardcore simply because they watched the Saw trilogy in the local multiplex. I'm talking about people who've seen classics like The Manson Family, Cannibal Holocaust, & Nacho Cerda's Aftermath/Genesis. If you have watched these or are somewhat familiar with the titles, you've come a long way & might be ready for Palumbo's UNRATED Murder-Set- Pieces. (I'm only referring to the Director's Cut as the Lions Gate edit was snipped to ribbons by at least 20-23 minutes.) M-S-P is one of the most brutal, nasty, & downright ghoulish horror films ever made. I say this in a cordial way.

For the guy who thought he'd seen it all, I wasn't prepared. In fact, I felt a bit soiled after watching it & left the bathroom light on in the hallway. Finally, I've seen the film that goes  almost all the way & there is nothing else like it to the best of my knowledge. Yes!! You have it all here!! There are ugly throat slashings, decapitated heads, & the most nauseating rape scenes ever. If that doesn't send you over the edge, our beloved psychopath also kills a young child & there is a scene of cannibalism to boot. Finally, a film that does everything it aspired to do & then some which shocks the living hell out of everyone. Palumbo doesn't just push the horror envelope. He shoves it down your throat .

Set in the Sin City known as Las Vegas, M-S-P tells the unsavory story of a German photographer who loves to capture beautiful on film before & after he kills them. That's not to suggest he discriminates. He will also kill virtually anyone who stands in his way including porn shop cashiers, criminals, & naturally young children. It would seem that nothing can stop this madman & one should steer clear if at possible. Night after night, he prowls the streets searching for beautiful girls to have sex with & photograph before he proceeds to torture them to death. Trust me when I say that things don't always happen in this order necessarily.

While the plot line may be very paper thin, Palumbo does gives us a true visual feast with the colorful lighting & photography. Rue Morgue actually praised his masterful set pieces & even made a comparison to fright auteur Dario Argento, which is quite impressive.

I have come to the conclusion this may very well be one of the most disturbing films I've ever seen. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for Henry: Portrait Of A Serial Killer nor the darkly humorous American Psycho which are both excellent films by any standards. Murder-Set-Pieces has outdone both of them & probability suggests there will never be another film to shock me senseless like Palumbo's masterpiece. If anyone has seen this film, please feel free to leave me comments. Unpleasant dreams, my friends......",1240876800,5,3178,4.706834532374101
2458403,1,B000CDG5MW,"This is one of the most over-hyped and deceptively marketed pieces of unredeemable dreck ever. The talentless ""director"" knew that he could never make a quality film, so he set out to make a ""controversial"" film, evidently so that he could get free press from all the protests against his film. When a film is this small, ratings can be skewed by a handful of people creating fake accounts and giving it 5 stars, which is reportedly what happened with this disaster. The director made claims that 3 photolabs refused to develop the film because it was too graphic, yet I can't understand how they could know what was on the negative until AFTER they developed it. Sounds like an outrageous claim to pique one's curiosity. The dvd case is covered with warnings of ""shocking, disturbing, controversial, most graphic film ever..."" which is a real crime on this chopped up Lionsgate version as it is false advertising in this context. I've seen more shocking episodes of Gilligans Island. What I don't see on the cover are accolades to the skill and craftsmanship which went into this film, because there wasn't any. The sound cuts out in spots due to a bad mic connection during filming and most of the dialog had to be looped in post and doesn't match up very well. The ""actors"" are mostly strippers, prostitutes and porn stars, some literally pulled off the street the day before shooting. Since there is no plot and the script sucks, acting wasn't really required. Just scream and die covered in blood. Oh, and get naked first.

This was just an utterly pointless movie with a poser nazi wannabe who was supposed to be the Grandson of some top Hitler aide as the serial killer. The plot is: **SPOILER ALERT** Killer eats, works out to nazi propaganda film, drives around, picks up girl, has sex and kills her, goes to sleep, has nightmares, gets up, eats, works out to nazi propaganda, walks around, picks up girl, kills girl...repeat if necessary. The shameless director included footage of the Twin Towers in flame because his cinematographer happened to be in NY on Sept. 11 and got 7 min. of ""THE ONLY 35mm FOOTAGE IN EXISTANCE."" One more embarassing claim to fame. He tried to justify it in the directors commentary by saying the killer felt it represented how society was falling apart. Right, a guy who butchers 30 women and little girls thinks society is messed up. I've got the only 8mm footage in existance of my 7th birthday if he wants it for his next masterpiece.

The guy who made this garbage set piece, acts like a spoiled 3 yr. old trying to get attention by acting out. It is nothing but gratuitous crap meant to shock and offend, rather than entertain, the acting is horrible, the script is worse, and other than the blood splattered dungeon, the set dressing is non-existant.

2458404,1,B000CDG5MW,"I am an avid horror fan. I was extremely excited to get this film from Amazon after reading about it here and elsewhere. No spoilers here, just a list of things you might want to consider before buying this film.

1. The film does have ""shots"" of women that have been sadistically brutalized. These ""shots"" are convincing and very bloody. However, the disappointment is that we rarely (perhaps once or twice we see parts of an actual crime taking place, hitting women, slashing thorats, stabbing a child). But really we see the killer lifting weights more than we see him killing. We also see him having soft-core porn sex with a two or three of his victims (and that is more graphic than any actual act of violence perpetrated against the victims). Remember, the actual ""images"" of violence are there, but the ""acts"" are largely absent.

2. We don't get much violence and on top of that the characters are unconvincing and amateurish. Sometimes amateur acting adds to a horror film's realism. It didn't work here. The protagonist delivers a completely unconvincing performance and is laughable. He's as plain as they come.

3. Also, it would have been nice to have some subtitles for the German parts. If this was intentional, I found it a pointless choice.",1232064000,7,1258,4.788018433179723
2458405,2,B000CDG5MW,"i want to clarify from the get go that my rating of 2 (i'd actually give it 2.5) stars has nothing to do with me thinking this movie is disgusting. i'm not an over-dramatic type calling this 'torture porn' or anything of the like. i'm a horror fanatic. the entire 2nd floor of my house is dedicated to my love of the genre.... much to the dismay of my very patient wife.

one thing's for sure... there is / was a ton of hype around this film... some of it deserved... some of it not.

if you're reading this, you probably have an idea of what this movie's about, so i'm not going to waste my time going over the basics. i will, however, spend some time going over my issues with the film:

1.) the ""plot"" (and i use that term very loosely) is almost non-existent. there's just enough to get a vague (and when i say ""vague"" i mean VERY VAGUE) idea of why this guy does what he does. throughout the movie you see flashbacks to the photographer's childhood that leads you to believe he suffered some sort of abuse as a child. what kind? who knows. was he even actually abused? who knows. is he just crazy? who knows. the rest of the ""plot"" revolves around the photographer's girlfriend's young sister stumbling in to his ""secret hobby shop."" basically, there's just enough of plot here to keep this movie from becoming nothing more than five minute mini-torture music videos.

that leads me to my second issue with this film...

2.) nearly all (all?) of the brutal torture / rape / killing scenes are shot in a poorly done marilyn manson-esc video style, complete with generic, stereotypical, crappy heavy metal music. i honestly think if you were to take out the crappy nu-metal, these scenes would have been much more effective. sadly, the way a large portion of these kill scenes were shot remind me of the way the kill scenes in Saw are shot. it really didn't do it for me at all.

3.) don't get me wrong. there is definitely some brutal stuff in this film, but as far as being gory goes, not so much. with the exception of a scene involving a chainsaw, you're basically left with naked women covered in buckets of fake blood. *yawn*. i don't want to ruin the scene involving the chainsaw, but i have my own issues with that as well.

4.) 9/11 flashbacks. again, i'd like to clarify... i'm not a prude when it comes to, well, anything. i'm not going to get up in arms simply because 9/11 footage was used in a film. my issue with this is that it seems to be used for nothing more than shock value. it really is completely irrelevant and out of place here... and try as i might, i just can't come up with a way to tie the happenings of 9/11 with the photographer's constant childhood flashbacks.

5.) the whole ""nazi"" thing. again... this seems to be used for nothing more than shock value. it serves absolutely no purpose other than to add more disturbing imagery to the film. the way i look at stuff like this is by asking myself ""does this help the story? detract from it? neither?"" the answer here is an overwhelming ""neither."" making this guy a nazi sympathizer doesn't aide to the story in the slightest. to me, it's just another excuse to ""shock"" the audience with pictures of hilter, videos of his speeches and giant nazi flags. i'm not down with that. at least find a way to really tie it in to the story. until then, i call b.s. i hope others out there are smart enough to know when they're being force fed garbage.

the one section in this film that honestly disturbs me... and the one section i'd say is very well shot, is the section that involves his (apparent) son in the crib. my hat's off to palumbo for that. it was so disturbing, in fact, that i actually sat there after the movie was done thinking to myself ""what kind of parent would allow their one year old child to be involved in a scene like that?"" i'm actually surprise palumbo didn't throw some crappy heavy metal music over that section.

the final nail in this flick's coffin: the ending. yawn city. predictable. boring. anti-climactic. when the credits started rolling, i made a certain up-and-down hand gesture involving my fist being perpendicular to my crotchal region while yawning. this will remain in my dvd collection... mostly because i'm a completest and never part with anything i own in the genre, but i doubt i'll ever watch it again.

i've never seen the R version, but i can only imagine what was cut from it.

final verdict: if you have any interest in seeing this, i suggest renting it before buying it. if you're a huge horror fan, it may be worth checking out. just not so sure it'd be worth spending more than $10 on. if i would have picked this up when it was selling for $50+, i wouldn't have been a happy camper.",1231804800,8,4714,4.411967779056386
2458406,5,B000CDG5MW,"Let me take a moment to personally thank director Nick Palumbo for going where few horror directors even dream of going - he doesn't just go there, he moves right in and throws a freakin' party.  I can't imagine any gorehound not being impressed by what they see here (as long as they get the uncut director's version and not the extremely neutered R rated version).  Murder-Set-Pieces is, in a word, brutal.  No one can ever accuse Palumbo of being a gore tease like the established horror directors in Hollywood.  Copious amounts of blood, ultra-realistic scenes of torture, and several extremely violent rape scenes await you in the main character's blood-soaked killing room.  And this madman doesn't discriminate by age, either - he's more than happy to hack and slash little girls to pieces when he's not sadistically destroying young women.  This film may or may not live up to its tagline (""The most visceral horror film ever made""), but if it falls short, it's not for lack of trying.  That's why thought police all over the world have tried to deny you the right to see this movie.  It was banned in the UK (not surprising, given the UK's history of censorship), and it was banned from every film festival in North America.  The film proudly bills itself as ""the only film in the history of cinema that was banned from the Big 3 film labs.""  The final credits list Herman Goering, Heinrich Himmler, and Joseph Goebbels alongside Robert Ley as executive producers.  This Nick Palumbo guy just doesn't care about all of the critics lining up to condemn him and his film, and I love the guy for that.  Heck, he even uses one scene in the movie to unabashedly plug his first film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nutbag-The-Story-of-the-Vegas-Ripper/dp/B0013K2PS6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nutbag: The Story of the Vegas Ripper</a>.

Go out and read some of the film's more critical reviews.  It's been damned as ""the lowest form of cinematic life,"" and the New York Times' Ned Martel actually opines about the psychological damage he ""knows"" some of the actors must have suffered just from appearing in the movie.

(Young Jade Risser appears nervous early on, but she rises to the occasion in plenty of time for the film's final harrowing scenes.  This girl has all the makings of a terrific scream queen once she reaches the other side of puberty.)  When the daiquiri-sipping elitists get this upset over a movie, you know it has to deliver.  Criticism of the acting performances is certainly valid, but I have no problem with the killer's brooding, stilted behavior.  For Pete's sake, do all of the poo-pooers out there expect an ultra-sadistic butcher to appear perfectly normal?

Needless to say, Murder-Set-Pieces is an independent horror film - a rather expensive one, as indie horror films go (the budget was 2.2 million dollars).  Shot on glorious 35 mm film, most of the budget was obviously spent on blood and gore.  It features several actual streetwalkers, strippers, and at least one pornstar (Crissy Moran) among its cast of victims (how's that for realism?), but that cast also includes Gunnar Hansen and Edwin Neal from the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Texas-Chainsaw-Massacre-2-Disc-Ultimate-Edition/dp/B000FS9FE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2-Disc Ultimate Edition)</a>, as well as the legendary Tony ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Candyman-Special-Edition/dp/B0002C4JJ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Candyman (Special Edition)</a>"" Todd, who acts the hell out of his one memorable scene.

By the way, there is an actual story here underneath all of the blood and body parts.  It basically comes down to an unfiltered and daring look into the mind of a sadistic serial killer, with plenty of cinematic tension supplied by the killer's oblivious girlfriend's sister, who seems to be the only person capable of recognizing that the weird German dude is creepy and dangerous.  You can't help but worry about young Jade's possible fate, especially when you see how willing the killer is to slaughter innocent little girls.

Unlike most critics, I'm not going to psychoanalyze the killer or the movie itself.  Instead, I will just say this: never before has sexual rage been unleashed this viscerally on the big (or small) screen.  Murder-Set-Pieces separates the real gorehounds from the wannabes.  It's so revolutionary that even some horror fans just don't get it - sadly, a few have even repeated the censorship mantra of the talking heads who make it their business to stifle creativity and to control what you are allowed to see, hear, and think.  Whether you love it or hate it, don't let anyone deny you the right to judge this film for yourself.",1224633600,3,5466,5.786516853932584
2458407,4,B000CDG5MW,"I saw only the Director's Cut of this movie so this review only concerns that.

The ""plot"" of this movie is paper thin, but that's what I expected when I picked up this film.  It involves a serial killer that has nazi roots that decides that no one is good enough to keep alive.  That about sums it up except that he does have a girlfriend at the beginning of the film and she has a daughter that thinks something is odd about him.  The dinner scene is especially ""revealing.""

What I didn't expect were cameos with Gunnar Hansen from Texas Chainsaw fame and Tony Todd from Candyman. their scenes are fun (in a sick sort of way of course).  By having them in this flick it shows that the director really respects the horror genre, to me that's important.  I'm so tired of directors that do a horror flick then go on to direct other things just so that they can make a buck.

There is a lot of care taken in the making of this movie.  The lighting, camerawork, film quality and music really sets the mood well.  The lighting is reminiscent of some of Dario Argento's work in Suspiria, lots of very strong colors.

This film is made for splatter fans that don't really need a lot of suspense or plot but just want to see a good amount of torture, gratuitous violence and some bad acting, which doesn't really detract from the overall intent of this movie, which is to make you say, ""I can't believe that they just showed that!""

I don't think that there is more than about 3 mins that goes by without having some type of bloodshed shown.  That to me is satisfying, so the movie delivers on several points, the body count is HIGH, the film is shot very well and some of the ""set pieces"" will leave some people repulsed (not me, but people that aren't used to this type of film).  Is it the most extreme thing that's out there?  No, but this is made for splatter fans only!

I know it sounds like I should have given this film 5 stars but there was 1 element that I didn't find that I would have liked to have more of and that's intensity.  The killer yelling at people in German while raping/torturing/killing them didn't really convey the intensity that I felt should have been there.  Maybe I'm just jaded because I've seen so many horror movies but the way some of the scenes start we are already deep into the torture, I would have liked to see some build up to the actual scenes.

I'm not saying the movie totally lacks intensity but it could have really built up the scenes and then gone off with the excessive violence which would have had more of an impact.  Overall, if your looking for splatter, you should enjoy what you find here, I did.

The DVD also contains an easter egg, when you go to the trailer section you will see the little girl's eye turn red by scrolling down the list of trailers, click on it and there is a preview of Fred Vogel's August Underground there.  Fred helped with special effects on Murder Set Pieces and also has a brief cameo as well for those who know his ""work.""",1222387200,3,3001,4.321428571428571

When Lions Gate announced that they were releasing the dvd, I knew it would be R rated (25 or so minutes cut!). Why are so many US film companies scared of controversy? Studio politics reign. It could of been released in R rated and unrated dvds. But like so many of their previous dvds, they chickened out. Back to the film - it was violent, gory, sexy, disturbing and some may say an exploitation movie. But writer/director Nick Palumbo has made a very good serial killer film with the psycho's obsession with Nazis, rape and murder. I laugh at the morons (the film censors) especially here in the UK, they are still out of touch with society and always will. Even THE MATRIX was cut when first released!

Now there are some prety f-up parts in the flick like the contraversial kid stabing but it only shows the knife in the kid it would be different if he went to town on her

but none the less it was crazy.

There are scenes that show a bit of blood sure, and the killer gets into frequent depraved situations, but they don't show anything!  Whenever a scene has the potential for extreme violence or gore, they pan away or cut to a different scene.  All that's really left after that is bad acting, boring dialog, and scenes of the killer driving his car around town.  And some naked chicks.

Okay apparently there is a director's cut available which contains the scenes that everybody's flapping about. However now that I've seen the movie and know how lame and boring it is, I have no motivation to see the director's cut.

And BTW, the version I got had some serious problems with the center (dialog) audio channel on the 5.1 track.

Murder, Set, Pieces is not Shakespeare; it is not some great artistic masterpiece; it is a nasty, brutal slasher/gore flick.

Both versions present the film in its original 1.85:1 widescreen. Sadly both version are NON-anamorphic (not enhanced for widescreen TV). The sound quality is very good but there was a problem with the DD 5.1 mix on my Lion's Gate DVD. The audio seemed to skip repeatedly, with glitches and flubs especially prominent during the dialogue sequences. In the end I had to resort to the alternate Dolby Stereo track which was fine by contrast. No problems with the Fright Flix audio.

However the Director's Cut also comes with a separate video Introduction by Writer/Producer/Director Nick Palumbo.

2458425,5,B000CDG5MW,"Society in chaos...black and white 35 MM film footage, shot by editor Brendan Flynt, of NYC on that terrible day in September almost five years ago...is the apropos image to begin one of the greatest horror films of all time, perfectly titled MURDER SET-PIECES. Not since William Friedkin's masterpiece of horror THE EXORCIST has a film captured the essence of the terrifying and the profane. Filmmaker Nick Palumbo's simple tale about an anonymous photographer slaughtering beautiful women in the seamy city of Las Vegas enraptured me from the first horrific frame of a bloodied, nude, semi-conscious woman strapped down in a torture chair all the way to the end credits.

Nick Palumbo pays homage to the horror films that came before MURDER SET-PIECES and then takes the horror genre to a whole new level of depravity.  With opening and closing odes to Tobe Hooper's ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" Nick Palumbo also manages to evoke horror and non horror films in between while maintaining a sense of originality. The dream-like flashback sequences with their haunting music and creepy images of a doll turned sexual fetish object is reminiscent of Dario Argento's ""Deep Red."" The colors in MURDER SET-PIECES pop (especially the red and blue flashes of light in the menage a trois motel scene) which adds another Argento-esque quality to the film.

The character named ""the photographer"" would fit perfectly with ""the driver"" and ""the mechanic"" of Monty Helman's ""Two Lane Blacktop."" During the second motel scene, a prostitute dances for the photographer which instantly brings to mind Bill Lustig's ""Maniac."" The major difference in this scene, however, is that the photographer orders the escort to undress as opposed to Lustig's maniac who tells his hooker to keep her clothes on.  Where Bill Lustig stopped from crossing the line into sexual violence Nick Palumbo obliterated it with his graphic and realistic portrayal of the sexually violent nature of serial murder. ""Murder-Set-Pieces"" even surpasses ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" with its absolutely brutal scene in which the photographer saws a screaming young woman's head open while she is trapped in the photographer's basement abattoir. Soaked in her blood, his feral eyes bulging with arousal the photographer truly looks like a demon from Hell.

Nick Palumbo went even further by graphically depicting the murder of children in MURDER SET-PIECES. While the horror of child murder has been explored in dramatic films like Fritz Lang's ""M"" the horror genre has shied away from this taboo subject, because the glorification of a child killer would be considered obscene. Yet the glorification of a teenage killer is fine so long as he has a witty repartee ala Freddy Krueger in Wes Craven's ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" franchise. Nick Palumbo exposes this hypocrisy by juxtaposing the murders of succulent young women with the equally savage killing of a little girl in a restroom.

Sven Garrett's performance as ""the photographer"" is intense and fearless. Sven Garrett instills the photographer with a real sense of menace and madness. The sexually violent nature of the role would intimidate lesser actors, but Sven immerses himself completely in the role thereby enhancing the performances of his fellow actors. To be honest, at first I didn't think much of his acting. Then, I realized it is the personality of the photographer that I did not like. The photographer is the antithesis of the charismatic Devil's advocate type of villain that audiences have become accustomed to watching in horror films. The photographer is more similar to real life serial murderers, and once I realized this fact I came to appreciate his performance a whole lot more.

MURDER SET-PIECES is a traditional horror film with the heart of a snuff film. A snuff film depicts the sexual act culminating with real murder as tantamount to reaching orgasm which is the actualization of sexual violence. While MURDER SET-PIECES sexual violence is simulated, Nick Palumbo has crafted such realism to the film that the confrontational scenes reach a level of disquiet rarely reached in cinema.  In the mnage a trois scene, the soundtrack rhythmically pulses throughout the scene, never changing even after the photographer has sliced the throat of one prostitute and then throttles another prostitute. This equivocal delineation between arousal and horror is incredibly transgressive and surpasses the intimations previous horror films have made between the two emotions. Only the cinematic flare of auteur Nick Palumbo in scenes such as the childhood dream like flashbacks or the nightmarish visions of the photographer remind the viewer that he is watching a work of fiction. This affect on the viewer is incredibly potent, and it is quite an achievement for a horror film to have the disturbing soul of a snuff film.

In MURDER SET-PIECES maestro Nick Palumbo has composed and orchestrated a magnum opus suffused with sensuous carnage that pushes the boundaries of horror in cinema. Nick Palumbo has created a depiction of serial murder on such a visceral, truthful level that previous filmmakers have never dared approach. By confronting audiences with the horror of violence, provocateur Nick Palumbo has forced the audience to examine our own blood lust. MURDER SET-PIECES, like the '72 Plymouth Barracuda driven by the photographer, fires on all cylinders from the directing, acting, special effects, soundtrack, etc.  Nick Palumbo takes cinema into the absolute heart of darkness with his visual depiction of the union between sex and death...violence and erotica. To paraphrase Francis Ford Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now""  Colonel Kurtz, "" MURDER SET-PIECES. The horror. The horror.""",1168214400,12,5727,5.25492341356674
