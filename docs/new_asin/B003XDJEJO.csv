4216211,5,B003XDJEJO,I enjoyed this movie. It was a tear-jerker. I was hoping that the ending would turn out better for Lesley Ann Warren and Meredith Baxter.,1275868800,4,137,4.52

4216224,3,B003XDJEJO,"This movie just never really gets interesting.  It's like someone said ""lets make an emotional sad film about someone dying using old actresses"".  The only point of interest is the helicopter mother played by Meredith Baxter. Her character was just not sympathetic at all.  What was all that about not knowing how to sit there and have a decent conversation with a perfectly nice guy.  Just rude to get up and leave when he hadn't done anything but be nice to her.  And, hanging onto her daughter to the point of  having her son in law out of work and miserable rather than let them move to where he could get a good job.  Just sick.  I never could stand Leslie Ann Warren.  All that grimacing and huge smiling that she calls acting just annoys me. She has ruined every movie I've ever seen her in.  The biggest mistake in this movie was telling the big SECRET way too soon. They should have held off on that till the last 1/4 of the movie.  When you look at this movie you keep waiting for something significant to happen. Scene after scene of kids not dancing very well was boring.  And, two scenes of the Warren character talking the kid into going on the stage.  What was that all about. One scene would have been way more than sufficient in both instances.  Just filling in the time apparently.  I'm sorry I bought this movie, sorry I wasted time looking at it and I don't recommend it. It's poorly written, poorly acted and badly directed.",1408320000,,1445,4.44106463878327
4216225,5,B003XDJEJO,"Very good story, grab the tissues tho!! A lesson in letting to and moving forward with your life but sometimes it is better to leave things as they are.",1400976000,,152,4.275862068965517
4216226,4,B003XDJEJO,"Nice story of 2 best friends. Sad, at times but has a good meaning. Good acting, and it kept my interest.",1398902400,,105,4.0476190476190474
4216227,5,B003XDJEJO,Fantastic Story and kept me going through the holiday season.  No longer having cable TV it was hard to find the movies I wanted to watch.  I chose several and WOW they were fantastic this is just one of them.,1393027200,,209,4.2
4216228,2,B003XDJEJO,"OK.  So I'm surely not the target audience here.  But really, if I want to hear someone sit around and complain all day long, I'll tune into Rush Limbaugh.  At least I might be updated on some current events.  Or hear about what an awful job that our president is doing.

But this ""film"" is beyond a sapfest, and it is beyond manipulative.  Granted, it was on TV -- I didn't change the channel because I was thinking about something far more important, such as watching paint dry -- and so therefore it was ""free,"" but still, don't you owe it to your audience more than just trying to induce tears?

I give nothing away when I say one of these actors (they used to be called ""actresses;"" what happened there?) gets cancer.  Chaos ensues and tears fall.  But one thing that really fell:  the remote control when I almost fell asleep while ""watching.""

Which reminds me:  I've got to tell my wife to change the channel back to the ID network after she's done watching something on either the Hallmark or Lifetime Networks.  That way, I can see something interesting, such as the reenactment of a nasty home invasion.  Otherwise, I might just be forced into watching some so-called uplifting material like this.",1392163200,,1208,4.58411214953271
4216229,5,B003XDJEJO,I saw this movie on tv and wanted to add it to my DVD collection... The quality of the movie was perfect... And the price was just right...,1364947200,,139,4.0
4216230,5,B003XDJEJO,"I truly enjoy this movie.  Meredith Baxter and Lesley Ann Warren are superb.  It is a story of true friendship and a secret these women share from their past.  Both women lives are completely different.  When Jane, an actress, discovers she has cancer, she wants to return to her hometown and the people she loves.  Once back home Jane and dear fried Ida enjoy the remaining time they have left, while also trying to decide if they should reveal the secret they have kept for many years. While the ending is sad, it also introduces happy futures for Ida and her daughter.",1338163200,2,571,4.5588235294117645

8407932,1,B003XDJEJO,"No one has a right to keep anyone's true identity from them, how Stepford Wives..this movie is disgusting and was created only to keep feeding the baby stealing, baby selling industry called adoption, which should of gone out business due to child abuse by now. Just remember WHO started closed adoption, a pedophile named Georgia Tann and remember that the system has not changed since and adoptees are still legally denied their original birth certificates which is psychotic and discriminatory. Adoption is Orwellian and Communist and should NOT be supported by decent Christian people. Being infertile gives NO one the right to play with a child's life, mind and identity. How would you like it if your whole life was a lie?",1496966400,,728,4.975409836065574
