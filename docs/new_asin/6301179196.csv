SYNOPSIS: Cheburashka (Cubby), Crocodile Genady (Charlie), and Old Lady Shapocliak are three of the most popular animated characters ever produced by Moscow's Soyuzmultfilm Studio, beloved by Russian children and adults everywhere. The three animated short films included in this DVD were created by Director Roman Kachanov and Art Director Leonid Shvartsman based on books written by Eduard Uspensky. Art Director Shvartsman worked his magic on Uspensky's Cheburashka, transforming the kangeroo-like creature with a bushy tail and yellow owl's eyes into the film's adorable innocent-eyed little Cheburashka with big plush ears.
The saga begins on the day this sweet creature is found by a fruit vendor in a crate of oranges. Rejected by the Moscow zoo because of his unknown species, he is befriended by a genial crocodile named Genady. Genady works at the zoo as a crocodile.
""Crocodile Gena"" Episode (#1): The improbable team befriends all who are lost and lonely and build a Playhouse for Friends.
""Cheburashka"" Episode (#2): Genady and Cheburashka, now inseparable friends, build a playground for children.
""Shapocliak Episode"" (#3): Genady and Cheburashka go on vacation and protect nature with the capricious Old Lady Shapocliak.
Highly recommended.",1040601600,2,1322,5.582089552238806
