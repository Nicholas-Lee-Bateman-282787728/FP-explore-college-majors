1384260,5,B00004ZERV,A tremendous collection of popular holiday songs by the 3 most famous tenors of our generation! A welcome addition to any musical DVD collection.,1140739200,,145,5.083333333333333
1384261,5,B00004ZERV,"Buy it!
  For all those who love the 3 tenors, Christmas, joy, or any other wonderful feeling, BUY IT. I Love how Pavarotti adds an Italian version to ""Feliz Navidad."" Listen to ""Un Nuevo Siglo"" & ""Children of Christmas"" written by Domingo's son, Placido jr.; SUPERB!
  Listen to Pavarotti's excellent ending of ""I'll be Home for Christmas."" He has THE BEST HIGH NOTES IN THE WORLD!
  Listen to ""Ave Maria, Dolce Maria""- co-written by Pavarotti
(Notice how after the performance of that song, Carreras leans over and compliments Pavarotti,""Bravo, Signor."")
  Speaking of Carreras, who doesn't love him? He is just adorable in this concert, althogh his singing is rather...safe,...Non-Challenging, for lack of a better term.
Oh, well, He's out of this world for any tenor, much less for a man who has been through leukemia.
  Domingo is his lovely, charismatic self, much improved from the 3 tenors 1998 Paris performance.
  The concert is nicely recorded w/2 audio choices and bios of the tenors.
  Buy it, Listen and watch, be enthralled, Love it!!!",1133395200,5,1050,5.02906976744186
1384262,4,B00004ZERV,"I never bought a christmas record, CD, DVD, of my life. But this one is good. Great singers indeed. It completes your ""three tenors"" collection. A vhs of 83 minutes of goodies.",1132272000,2,176,4.53125
1384263,5,B00004ZERV,"If you expect the three of them to sound like they did 30 years ago, this is not the dvd for you. Even if they are the superstars of opera, they're not supernatural and to me it doesn't feel right to constantly compare a singer to his former performances. However, all three tenors are in good mood this evening and their singing is wonderful, so if you're looking for a dvd to put you in the right Christmas spirit, try this one.

This concert is a mixture of solos and duets as well as all of them performing together. The repertoire spanning from traditional Christmas songs to more popular versions makes this dvd very enjoyable. There are beautiful renditions of the Spanish songs ""La Virgen lava paales"" and ""Feliz navidad"" where Carreras and Domingo obviously feel at home. I also love Carreras' rendition of ""Pregaria"". And ""Carol of the drum"" is one of my favourites. It's fun listening to ""I'll be home for Christmas"", ""Sleigh ride"" and ""Winter wonderland"". The two latter will probably make you start toe-tapping.

It's true that Pavarotti's mastering of the English language isn't too good. He's actually giving some of these songs a whole new meaning, but shouldn't we forgive an old man for that? I find it amusing when he's singing ""I'll be home for Christmas, you can play on me..."". Or what about when he's singing ""I'll be home for Christmas, please have snow and MISTLE AND TOE......""  And the first time I watched this dvd and heard him calling HOO-HOO and saw Carreras' reaction to it, I just had to laugh. In my opinion this only adds to the charm of these three opera singers. The minor mistakes we hear them doing makes them only more approachable. And after all, it is a live concert - not a studio recording.

I know what I'm going to do this Christmas. I'll light a lot of candles, possibly light the fire, get out all the Christmas candy and make myself a cup of hot chocolate before curling into a comfy chair and watching this concert. Feliz Navidad to the three tenors from the ""bottoN"" of my heart......",1126483200,27,2035,4.597796143250688
1384264,4,B00004ZERV,My whole family enjoyed this DVD. I would expect to play this as a family tradition every year. The reason I did not give this 5 stars is because it does not come in wide screen.,1070150400,5,178,3.9722222222222223
1384265,5,B00004ZERV,"What other DVD for X'mas do we have that would appeal even to the children that are also sung in English?  The orchestra was superb and the children's choir was wonderful too. Domingo was young no more, neither was any of the other two. But their voice and singing was not aged at all. Very enjoyable.
Having said that,  are we really that short of composer that there is no way we could make a proper trio or a duet out of these marvelous opera singers? Instead we only  have them sing solos or doing the same part all the time AFTER ALL THESE YEARS!Particularly so when Domingo is at the same time such a wonderful baritone singer. We could have at least some better arrangement than that.",1051228800,4,691,4.3828125
1384266,4,B00004ZERV,"This dvd is great entertainment no matter what the faults; and absolutley worth having as what will most likely the last time the tenors are released on DVD together.  The air is light and the old guys are obviously enjoying themselves more than in the paris concert the year before.
Domingo is the clear best in this concert.  He is 100x better than the year before in paris.  He is sleak and younger looking; his voice not missing a beat.  The instrument is just as glorious as it was for the first 3 tenors concert.  He is getting up there in years and his voice shows no sign of going away.  He sings with a dark and soothing tone all night annd some of his performannces are really quite memorable; and understandable.  His english is charming and excellent.  Bravo Placido!
Carreras sounds much better than he did in paris.  I might even go as far as to say that his middle range is more solid than in los Angeles in 1994; but his high notes weren't there in Vienna. It was refreshing to see him in this concert because he comes off as an artist; not as someone who was an artist before he blew out his voice and started wobbing his way through showy and glitzy galas playing off of his former talent.  The main difference is he stays within his limits;  he sings above the staff only twice all night and keeps away from his warbling fortissimo's as much as possible.  There is no doubt the voice that rocked opera in  the early eighties is gone; but he presented a charming, well rounded baritenor sound only slightly warbly.  His piano's are still graceful and his solo is surprizingly solid.  His reapearence on the opera stage in SLY appears to have brought his voice into a cohesive unit again.  He also looks much more charming with undyed hair.
Pavarotti sounds like Pavarotti.  He sings a billion high notes and his tone is still spinning like a much younger man. Beyond his great sound the concert is a failure for him.  His pronuciaton is a mockery of english.  Words roll out of his mouth like drool which ruins the unbroken legato with which he usually sings.  This is expecially bad in the more classical nummbers like O holy night.  He also fails to bring the same amount of energy that the other two bring. But look at it this way:  His doing well for a man in his late 60's.  I know alot of them who are in nursing homes;  So its all relative.  I tip my hat to a sextagenarian popping off high notes with relative ease.
  The mood is light and the singing is fabulous.  There are some pronuciation isssues, but overall the tenors stay within their aging voices and give a good performance.",1050796800,70,2611,4.428571428571429
1384267,4,B00004ZERV,"I have enjoyed very much the show. However, there is the risk of you to get disappointed if you intend to hear one of the three singers to reach the level of an opera performance or even the orginal ""The Three Tenors"". The musical repertoire is not also perfect. On the other hand I thought the arrangements, the children's choir and the sound quality very nice. I am very pleased to have purchased this DVD.",1034208000,10,408,4.453333333333333

1384295,5,B00004ZERV,"Like most I saw this on PBS originally and finally added it to my personal DVD and CD collection.  I hugely enjoyed the concert, because when it comes to fine singers, you would have to go a long way to hear three better singers than these individuals.  I have no problem with the DVD, and while the song selection may be a little disconnected to some American viewers, they were all done well IMO.  The only quibble I might have is how in the work is Imagine by John Lennon a Christmas song?  While Domingo is and has always been my favorite of the three, I thought all of them did a very adequate job in their  performance.  While some reviewers are fond of constantly pointing out the late Pavarotti's shortcomings in English pronunciation, I advise them to try and sing in German, Italian, or Japanese, for that matter and sing it at that level before they complain.  Me, vocally, I can't hold a tune in a washtub, so I enjoy listening to three masters singing Christmas songs in a manner that will, hopefully, be remembered for a long time.  I highly recommend this DVD.",1377993600,4,1075,4.476923076923077

1384328,5,B00004ZERV,"This is a lovely Christmas concert (1999, live in the Vienna Koncerthaus)--21 great holiday-time songs from O Holy Night to Winter Wonderland to Feliz Navidad. I also just watched/listened to the Yule Log version which, imo, is also a holiday treasure, too (same concert).

If you enjoy the kitsch of the Yule Log--and having it ""burning"" brightly during Christmas Eve and morning activities--this dvd solves the biggest problem of the Yule Log dvds--inconsistent music quality.

This dvd and the ""Three Tenors Christmas--Yule Log"" are the same concert, but songs in a different order. Somehow, seeing a fireplace while you just LISTEN to the tenors minimizes many of the ""in concert"" problems that others have mentioned with the dvd--most notably, Pavarotti's struggles with English (and apparently minimal French and German), and his apparent emotional disconnect at times from the other two.

Without the visual distraction of the dvd concert, the tenors' voices blend beautifully and the quality of the performances actually seems much improved. Of course, I enjoy Carreras' interesting personal blend of delicacy and fervor on stage (something which is lost without the ""performance"" dvd)--and Domingo's beaming warmth and intelligence that infuses every song. (Pavarotti's personal and musical self-assurance still shines through in the music without seeing him, perhaps even more so without the visual).

DVD concert and Yule Log DVD are both so enjoyable. In my opinion, it's wonderful to have either (or both) for the holidays.",1261699200,,1536,5.4411764705882355
1384329,5,B00004ZERV,"I really enjoy the whole ""Yule Log on Christmas Day"" idea accompanied by Christmas music. But (1) the television stations do not always show it and (2) Christmas music is of uneven quality, at best. Sometimes you have many songs that you would not choose yourself. And, (3) last year my local station did the Yule log combined with a radio station--meaning there were commercials throughout.

So the first thing this dvd offers is the Yule log burning in the fireplace--and it fit widescreen format perfectly.(There are two alternative views).

But, of course, what is so wonderful about this is the music. This is the same repertoire of Christmas songs, same recording, as the ""Three Tenors Christmas"". Since I just saw it yesterday (PBS pledge drive), I think it is actually improved by not seeing them and just hearing them instead.

Why? First because some of the close-ups are a bit...distracting. Also, because if you have company over it is easy for them to just start WATCHING the concert instead of just listening to the music. It is nice background for Christmas morning gift-opening--or for Christmas morning clean-up (I'm on my second hearing already).

Also, some of the problems with the concert itself (notably, Pavarotti's struggles with lyrics at times) are much less noticeable--even just charming--here. The tenors blend seamlessly this way--there are no distractions of performance to disturb the vocal pleasures.

And the music is the same 21 songs as in the dvd, just in a different order (beinning here with Carol of the Drum/O Holy Night--a lovely start). It ends, like the dvd, with the spirited rendition of Feliz Navidad. (I really enjoy the blending of English - French - Spanish - Italian - German lyrics on so many songs--and how they work around Pavarotti's lack of French and German--and struggles with English--so that it's really not a problem and does not in any way distract from his assured tone and delivery. (Domingo, of course, is fluent and sings beautifully in all five, while Carreras brings both delicacy and fervor to whatever he is called on to perform.)

I think this is the best Yule Log edition and would make a wonderful Christmas gift. Hopefully, it will not be quickly discontinued as some others have. It the perfect Christmas/Christmas eve treat. Highly recommended.",1261699200,,2320,5.012987012987013

This whole venture was never much more than high camp, and if that's your taste, you can't do better than this DVD.  When I tuned in to a PBS broadcast (how proud I am that our fine public television folks use this as a fundraising device) my wife's first reaction was that it seemed like a Saturday Night Live spoof (actually, even SNL did better, with a remarkably lovely rendition of Adeste Fideles with Pavarotti and Vanessa Williams back around 1999).  Watching these fellows sing Winter Wonderland or Sleigh Ride, it's hard not to die from laughter  (sort of like when they sang My Way in their Dodger Stadium show).  Well produced, but if you want great Christmas-season music making, I'd refer you to Pavarotti's 1978 concert in Montreal's Notre Dame Basilica (a PBS staple for much of the 1980s and 90s), and I'll be forever happy that I heard the great Domingo sing Siegmund in Washington last year.",1197504000,8,1040,4.718232044198895
