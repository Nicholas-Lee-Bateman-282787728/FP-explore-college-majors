6755661,5,B00OL00ADC,"Horror Island was released in 1941. A cheapie it sure has it's chams. One of the best lines of dialogue is said by character actress Iris Adrian when she says,Now this is what I call a party, Dames screamin',and radios playin'. A tough, bleached blonde, she adds  spice to any film she is in. Look up her credits on IMDB. Fans of horror, and comedy films will like this one.",1434844800,4,374,4.3428571428571425
6755662,5,B00OL00ADC,"This was a fun old Movie with a ridiculous plot but great characters. Worth multiple viewings. I would suggest the reader buy the ""Universal Horror Classic Movie Archive"" though as it is cheaper and also contains ""The Black Cat"" with Basil Rathbone, a young Alan Ladd, Bela Lugosi & Broderick Crawford (called Brod Crawford here) which is a ""who done it"" in an old Mansion with a good cast. Crawford is hilarious as a goofy dude who wants to buy the old Mansion and brings with him Hugh Herbert (also hilarious) as an ""Antique Expert"".
This DVD also contains ""Night Monster"" with Lionell Atwill & Bela Lugosi which is the Movie I wanted to initially purchase until I ran across this ""DVD Deal"" which also contains ""Man Made Monster"" with Lon Chaney Jr. & Lionel Atwill and ""Captive Wild Woman"" with John Carradine and Milburn Stone ('Doc' on TV's Gun Smoke) as the hero. Great Deal for the price. ""Night Monster"" is a spooky old flick with that old Universal Music which adds more suspense to the killings of various Physicians gathered together in a old Mansion as the killer is not revealed until the end.",1433894400,5,1107,4.653061224489796

6755664,3,B00OL00ADC,"I thought that I had only ordered one each, but apparently two; so becareful. This is more of a light mystery comedy that a sub-standard horror flick. But still a good watch.",1420761600,,174,4.46875
6755665,4,B00OL00ADC,A great film of the genre and like many others of the time about a spooky old castle/haunted house and their guests.  This is a great print of the film. This Universal classic has been edited though and very cleverly about 26min into the movie. If you have the version released on the Universal Horror Classic Movie Archive you will be able to see the difference immediately. The scene has been edited as a close up of the actors to eliminate the lighting man on the bottom right hand of the screen shining the spot light onto the actors as he crawls out of view - obvious error in the editing process at the time but was famous in the movie for fans and film buffs to point out. You still see the evidence of the spot light briefly in this version as it flickers but the crewmember has been totally eliminated.,1416355200,18,811,4.3355263157894735
8684025,3,B00OL00ADC,"Horror Island is one hour and one minute and was released in theaters on March 28, 1941. The main story is the save the life of a peg leg sailor who was pushed in the water. The grateful sailor presents half a treasure map to Bill Martin and Stuff Oliver as a reward for saving his life. The other half was stolen when he was pushed in the water. The three of them go see an expert to see if the map is real and find out it is a fake. So, they come up with an ideal to turn the island into a haunted island and sell tickets people to take a cruise to a haunted island to find buried treasure. Including Bill and Stuff a total of ten people go on the haunt cruise. Unbeknownst to them, the person who stole the other half of the map is looking for the treasure too. Overall the movie should have been called Horrible Island. It starts off slow and takes about a half hour for the story to kick in. The jokes are lame, and the plot stinks. It took me several weeks from start to finish to watch this movie. Horror Island gets a C-.",1525910400,,1029,4.0

8684027,5,B00OL00ADC,"What a super fun ""haunted house"" murder mystery (my favorite kind)!  It takes almost half of this approximately hour long movie to get to the Island, but once there the rest of the movie is definitely worth the wait.  The story centers around a group of people off on a treasure hunt ""tour"" but then the murders start (not sure if they got their money back for that twist).  The audio and visual are great and I think any other fans of the B&W mysteries from the 1930's and 1940's  would be pleased to add this to their DVD collection.",1487030400,2,535,4.32
8684028,5,B00OL00ADC,Fine DVD audio and video; prompt delivery - thank you!,1479340800,,54,4.5
8684029,5,B00OL00ADC,"This was a nice surprise having never heard of it before. Reading the reviews I decided to go for it and I am glad I did. It's a light hearted spooky adventure full of surprises, wonderful gloominess, an old castle, and who is the villain? A treat.",1461715200,3,248,4.297872340425532

8684031,2,B00OL00ADC,"Good-ish littleUniversal  B-movie horror film, set in an island castle with sliding panels, secret passages, etc. Too bad they don't make better use of Iris Adrian, one of the movies' primo. wisecracking  ""Gal pals."" See Iris at her best in ""Lady of Burlesque.""",1453248000,2,261,5.046511627906977
8684032,4,B00OL00ADC,"As a big fan and collector of almost any of the old classic Universal horror mysteries no surprise I like this one too. It's a lot like the Black Cat
with Basil Rathbone not the Lugosi Karloff film. Dick Foran from the Mummy's Hand which is one of the best Mummy Movies is in this one
with his usual Hero with his usual comedic acting style which fits this movie perfectly and the great Leo Carroll stars too. The title is pretty
clear and like many of these type of movies where a group goes to a mansion on an Island and they usual things happen! Nothing ground
breaking for these types of movies but this one is better than most of them. If your a classic Universal fan you should add to collection.",1447632000,2,702,4.246268656716418
