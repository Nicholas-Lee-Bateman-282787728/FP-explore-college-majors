5423382,5,B00AFEYI3G,"I thought this film was magnificent. Why you may ask? Well, first off it's different. It plays with the idea that some people have when they think about what happens when someone they know is sexually assaulted and the law does nothing about it. I know that that it is a wrong thing to do, but it's a movie and that is what makes it different. Revenge mostly leads to destruction and I think that this movie shows that and not to mention badass female characters that can save themselves.

I know that a few reviewers complained about plot, but these days most movies lack plot and continuity. I found no problem with it because it was nice to watch an original movie for once.",1364256000,3,677,4.416

I love the scene wear she's dressed up in a kimono type outfit with a samurai sword (a hatori honzo no doubt) and creepy geisha mask at the party.. trust me it does not end well. All in all I loved it It was totally not the run of the mill film you see everyday.",1363996800,8,533,3.810810810810811

5423386,4,B00AFEYI3G,"Girls Against Boys was a Clever film that from the trailer leads you to believe it's another ""I Spit On Your Grave"" or ""Last House on The Left"",it even co stars Andrew Howard who plays the Sheriff in ""I Spit On Your Grave"" but what we get is much smarter and will not be as satisfying to the hard core slasher fan.
This film is more thought provoking and has less gore. Although there are some moments that are pretty hard core most of the brutalizing is done off camera and left to your imagination which at times can be more effective. Myself, I prefer to see the gore as I am an avid slasher fan. Even so I was not disappointed in this film and found it to be very entertaining.

Throughout the film I kept thinking where is this really going? It's plays quite ambiguously,I got this feeling from act one in a scene where Nicole LaLiberte who plays Lu glanced in a bathroom mirror but even with that it didn't end up where I thought it would which I believe is a good thing,I hate for a film to be predictable.

Again, much of it is subjective but effective all the same. The stand out actor in my opinion was Nicole LaLiberte who was excellent as Lu a true sociopath in every sense of the word.
Her Samurai costume was very effective as was Danielle Panabaker's mouse costume which played out in the third act,Oh the Irony in that.
I would recommend this to anyone who want's to see a smart film with a few bits of effective gore. I would not recommend it to the stalk and slash set.",1361836800,7,1487,4.250883392226148
5423387,5,B00AFEYI3G,"Shae (Danielle Panabaker) is a student who studies male fantasies and how they view women as objects. She is hurt by an older male boyfriend who patches things up with his separated wife for the sake of his three year old daughter. Distraught, Shae is taken under the wing of a somewhat psychotic Lulu or Lu (Nicole LaLiberte) a woman straight out of a Billy Joel song...""She can carelessly cut you and laugh while you're bleeding.""

On the rebound, she goes out with Lu and gets involved in a situation where ""No"" doesn't carry any meaning. With the aid of Lulu, they go on a killing spree, after which you wonder where this movie will go. Unlike so many films in this genre, it smartly brings it home.

The film brought to mind ""Shame"" and ""Compliance"" two recent films sold as being ""disturbing and thought provoking"" which are nothing more than perv films. This one is the opposite. It is sold as a perv film, but is really more thought provoking as it looks into psyche of sexes and the way they view each other and what women would do if they could get away with it.

This film ignores plot continuity points such as body disposal, clean up, or the police investigating the homicides. This is a theme driven film, not plot driven.

This is a soft 5 star rating. Most people won't like it. I enjoyed the small clever aspects of this film. The slow motion scene of the smoke leaving the gun, or the young girl riding by with vampire teeth as a way to say, ""what roles are we subconsciously teaching our children."" The policeman with the straw irritatingly sipping from a cup. Lu speaking at the Tarantino restaurant ""explaining"" the film theme. At the end there is a small insert of Lulu smoking a cigarette that brought the film home. Bravo Austin Chick for making a feminist slasher film into a subliminal art work. I appreciate what you did.

5423392,3,B00AFEYI3G,"I think the only good scenes in this movie are when the red head is in them, she really is believable as a sociopath. What I don't really like is a lot of the killing becomes pointless and how easily the blonde model we're supposed to believe is a college student/bar tender accepts the casual murders her new friend commits in front of her. I usually like revenge films in the horror genre because I'm a woman who's been wronged and it's kind of cathartic to watch people who remind you of the men who hurt you get theirs but this one didn't sit well with me. I didn't see most of the men as deserving victims and I didn't buy the plot whatsoever. I'm only saying it's ok because of the redhead sociopath who has a sparkle in her eyes and at the same time seems detached and disconnected.",1460764800,,789,4.266666666666667

It is rather a drama about a girl (Danielle Panabaker) who is attacked and then sets out to get revenge on the man who assaulted her. It is well acted and well written and is more of a serious piece than the title suggests.,1443052800,,341,3.9565217391304346

The body can and seems to make a statement. Hey, we'er ok we can do more than having just sex, we can enjoy each other company beyond the horizontal Mumbo. Again it's a feeling thing.  Once a woman give her body to her lover. It's ok in some aspects I think. But once her heart is hurting. You can cancel Christmas. No self respecting woman want's to be a rebound girl. Healing process is not zero to sixty event.  Nevertheless her response should stand and be respected. ""No is No"" and not "" Well let me just..."" But one could say this end justify it's means.

5423406,1,B00AFEYI3G,"With a name like Girls Against Boys you might be expecting a somewhat tongue-in-cheek, over the top romp but thats (unfortunately) not what we get.  What we get instead is a decidedly downbeat, girl power/men are pigs revenge film that mostly fails to explain its motivations and fails to captivate the viewer.  The usually enjoyable Danielle Panabaker (Piranha 3DD, The Ward) plays shy college student Shae, whose affair with a married man comes to an end when he breaks things off, attempting to patch up his relationship with his wife.  Now, given the state of marriage in this country we should be applauding the man for making the attempt to keep his family together but no.  Director Austin Chick uses this event instead to have Shae and a psycho friend go on a killing spree against men they feel have wronged them.

Depressed over the break up, Lu takes Shae out on the town where they meet several men in a club, after a lot of heavy drinking and provocative dancing, and go with them back to their apartment.  One eventually walks Shae home but ends up forcing himself on her, sexually assaulting the young student.  When Shae tells Lu what happened they decide to get their revenge.  But this is no I Spit on Your Grave style of revenge film where the culprits are so despicable you're only too happy to see them get their just desserts.  Instead, most of the men killed here are not guilty of anything other than being born a man.

In order to track down the boy who raped Shae they arrive at the apartment of his friends to get his address, whereupon they shoot the two men who had no hand in or knowledge of the assault. But hey, all men deserve it right?  Later they abduct the man who broke up with Shae but despite the pleas for his wife and daughter he gets shot anyway.  Lu later seduces a cop at the police station and shoots him by sticking a gun where the sun doesnt shine, pulling the trigger.

Shae, like all of us wonder what the hell is wrong with Lu.  Did she have a traumatic childhood?  She tells Shae she was raped by her fathers friends with his approval before she starts laughing and says shes only kidding, she had a wonderful childhood.  So basically the motivation simply is men suck so kill them.  Brilliant.  Hopefully no one will ever let Austin Chick direct another filmnext time he might be going after puppies or bunny rabbits.",1438387200,11,2369,4.508196721311475
5423407,5,B00AFEYI3G,"Well despite the many negative reviews you've probably read, I for one thought Girls Against Boys was awesome!  It's about Danielle Panabaker and Nicole LaLiberte's characters who've both been mistreated by guys so many times that, especially in the case of Nicole, they come up with really disturbing and twisted ways to kill all the men in their lives abruptly and violently without feeling any remorse whatsoever!  The lack of remorse totally reminded me of that other sick suspense called Funny Games.  Danielle's reason for vengeance is because she was raped one night and mistreated/dumped by a married guy she really liked, and well, Nicole's reason is more complicated and never really clearly stated (even though she sure loves teasing cops and leading men on!)

The lack of compassion that these two girls express when killing men is baffling, especially when they're sitting around at the kitchen table enjoying a bowl of Captain Crunch cereal immediately after shooting a man directly in his head with the blood squirting all over the kitchen floor!  How raw, haha.  It's also quite gruesome since they don't care HOW desperately these men beg for their lives.  In fact begging just increases the chances of being killed!  Then again so does cussing out the girls.  Either way if you're a guy you're totally screwed, haha.

Without spoiling anything significant, eventually Danielle is the one to come to her senses.  She realizes that her friend is totally messed up in the head.  Well I'm glad at least *one* of these girls came to their senses because the lack of any kind of feeling whatsoever after the killings was the most disturbing thing I've seen in a suspense in a really long time!  Then again Danielle does tear up one night.  For a while there I was seriously wondering if they're both crazy in the head to the point of being hopeless.  Nicole's character eventually becomes obsessed with Danielle to the point that Danielle can't even come home late after a date without being heavily questioned.  I found that aspect of the story fascinating but also sort of clichd in another respect, and also I wasn't sure if Nicole was serious or not when she mentioned something deeply disturbing pertaining to being raped as a child.  This conversation could've been interpreted a couple different ways.

And wow, Danille Panabaker (with her fasincating last name reminding me of pancakes and breakfast donuts, hehe) looks attractive doesn't she?  So does Nicole LaLiberte, but Nicole's more of the sexy type.  Danielle's just downright cute and resembles a young Jennifer Garner.  So adorable when she dresses up in that Halloween costume with whiskers drawn onto her face. :)

The soundtrack is amazing!  It blends early 80's Cars (WOW I totally forgot about the Cars song ""This Could Be Love"" a song I haven't heard in over 25 years, and Donovan's ""Hurdy Gurdy Man!"")  The acting is pretty good, and the storytelling is surprisingly solid.  The many low ratings around the internet for this film are mysterious to me.  It's true the story takes about 20-25 minutes to get anywhere because for a while we see Danielle going through aimless drug trips of some kind while attending parties and travelling from room to room exploring buildings, but that's the only complaint I have with the movie.",1435795200,3,3313,4.935018050541516

Let's make it quick and numbered:

1. Suppose this is a wonderfully titillating film for first year college students oft late for class after nights where the film society drinks until late hours, but the movie does not even live up to its tawdry front cover.

2. Acting was better and had more depth on Petticoat Junction where actresses were even easier on the eyes.

3. Plot less developed than a Leopold Sacher-Masoch wet dream

4. Should have been presented in Pan & (Trash)Scan mode for better results.

5.  Enough of the Psychotic Sick Chick Flick already... if you need murder for empowerment go start a cult.

6.  Now if you truly want to see well-done dingbat dames see the exceptional movies  REPULSION with Catherine Deneuve or  Ms .45 with Zo Tamerlis

All it will get you is women actually trying and finding themselves dead for it. Guys are not this stupid. Rape is a horrible act but not only is this the wrong way to deal with it, it is also not realistic.

5423421,2,B00AFEYI3G,"Is that supposed to imply something about the mindset of all the leads in this film?--Or the spoilers you are about to probably read.  Girls Against Boys starts out cogently enough.  Shae gets dumped by her boyfriend who is almost twice her age.  She breaks down at her place of work and is found by Lu, a co-worker who had been watching her since she got hired a week earlier.  Next thing you know, the two are clubbing, Shae gets drunk, one thing leads to another and theres rape.  After that, it becomes revenge-fest for rest of the film.  Comparisons to Thelma and Louise, Single White Female, and the obvious one, I Spit On Your Grave are all superficial at best.  Yes, the girls do get freaky on some guys, but you have to wait until almost half the movie passes before the good stuff starts happening.  Also, the reason why you cant go deeper with these comparisons is because, at the end of the day, there just isn't enough to these two women to give much of a hoot about.  Shae is two dimensional and pretty much flings herself at whatever first guy seems to come her way, and Lu is completely Captain Crunch crazy.  Dont believe me?  Look at what they eat after their first kill!  There is nothing, utterly nothing, that even remotely hints at what Lus motivations might be at why she so nonchalantly hates anything with a penis and just as nonchalantly tries to erase them from reality.  Because it feels good?  Thats what passes for scriptwriting these days??  After reading some of the comments to the past reviews, I gave some thought that Lu was Shaes proverbial secret-sharer, but after the scene with the cop, that didn't seem to hold water.  And theres nothing the film that suggests that all the gore and violence took place inside Shaes headbut of course the rape didnt, right?

5423437,4,B00AFEYI3G,"A female empowerment revenge film made by a man?  Hmmmm... I don't think a female director would have made her shorts so short.  It was decent but hard to describe in a few sentences.  I recommend it to fans of the extreme (e.g., Hostel or Sawmovies).

Our male writer/director (Austin Chick) piles the female oppression on pretty hard.  We first find Shae(Danielle Panabaker) in some sort of feminist women's studies class talking to her classmate about her married boyfriend who's about 15+ years her senior.  After he breaks things off she feels lost without her unhealthy relationship as she fends off unwelcome advances at work (as a night club bartender) and sneaks off to cry about the loss of this loser.  As if she didn't already have a big enough deficit of self worth, Shae is always dressed in very short shorts or snug tiny skirts.

Lu (Nicole LaLiberte) works at the same bar, but she handles her shallow clientele with more assertiveness; she won't be bullied or taken advantage of by men.  She wants to help Shae feel better so they go out for a night of drinks and dancing.  But when one thing leads to another, Shae finds herself alone with a man in a situation where ""no"" has little weight.  As if that wasn't bad enough--and ALL of this has happened in just one day so far--Shae's day gets much worse with!  After  that which would undeniably be considered the worst day of her life, she can't even report the multiple assailants without being called ""sweetheart"" by a dismissively skeptical cop who says ""you look fine to me.""

Yeah, laying it on a little thick, huh?

Nicole LaLiberte does a solid job as the vengeful, sociopathic and sultry Lu.  She kills a man in a cringingly brutal manner and just looks him in the eye, watching as he dies.  She plans murders with the same calm deadpan demeanor one would have while reading the nutrition information off of a Captain Crunch cereal box.  The yin to Lu's yang, Shae is clearly the shy one, but she's along  for the ride willingly and finds her murderous footing quickly.  The two of them embrace their vengeful actions--not as righteous, but simply ""right"" as if they had no other cares or sense of consequence in the world.

They have some funny moments.  The delivery of their homicidal discussions provides a great dark comedy appeal in a few scenes.  The gore element is present and there's even a brief dash of torture, but it's not celebrated as it is in the Hostel movies. We still get gummy detoothed mouths, some dismemberment, and exit wound splatters, though.

The female empowerment is often credible, but at times, a bit over the top.  For example, Lu physically handles herself way too well for someone who's probably never lifted anything heavier than a 6-pack and is a crackshot with a handgun and we have no reason to find that credible.  However, anyone who watches this movie wants to see brutal and clever death scenes and likely wouldn't be too troubled with this shortcoming.

On the topics of female empowerment and death scenes, that's all we see.  Unlike crime thrillers, this movie does not alternate between the killers' agenda and the police detectives tasked with the investigation of their bloody wake, there are no chase scenes and our ""protagonist"" murderesses make no effort to evade their pursuers (which we have no knowledge of, if they exist) or to cover their tracks or wipe their fingerprints from the crime scene.  No.  This movie is about two girls avenging how they've been wronged.

This was a female empowerment revenge film made by a man.  It wasn't bad.  But...hmmmm...I don't think a female director would have made Panabaker's shorts so short or LaLiberte's lesbian-driven nudity soooooo, well--naked.  LOL.

It's still a fun romp, though.",1368662400,5,3761,4.778294573643411

8550862,4,B00AFEYI3G,I like the film. Very stylish for the time period. Has blood and killings that are fairly graphic and a morality to it that makes sense on a revenge level. But revenge isn't what our culture allows if your to keep a positive Karma. I watched this film b/c I experienced Nicole LaLiberte in Twin Peaks:The Return and she was very intriguing. Watch it!!,1503100800,,351,4.5
