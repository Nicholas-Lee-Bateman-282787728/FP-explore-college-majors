Punk Rope is a playful blend of recess and boot camp for people of all ages and fitness levels. Punk Rope leads to a wide range of health and fitness benefits including improved: body composition * bone density * strength * aerobic capacity * coordination * balance, all while having a great time!

8302424,5,B001FRCCPI,"I picked this up on a whim and it is great!  If you are looking for a workout that's fun and far from boring, Punk Rope its the bill.  First of all, jump roping is a lot harder than I remember it being when I was a kid!  It's also a fantastic workout.  You use all different muscles and you are never bored.  It really brings out the kid in you.

Plus, the soundtrack is awesome.  All of the bands are underground/not necessarily well-known punk bands.  It keeps your heart rate going and never gets boring.",1243123200,4,507,4.208333333333333
