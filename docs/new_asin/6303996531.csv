7858046,5,6303996531,The only thing I can say is after I watched this tape I wanted MORE! if you like romance and comedy and a sweet storyline - BUY IT!!!! Urd rocks the casbah! I give it NINE stars instead of five for funniness and cuteness. ^_^,1033516800,,225,4.022222222222222
7858047,5,6303996531,This is probably my favorite OMG episode.  In this episode Urd the oldest of the 3 goddesses is introduced.  After introducing herself to Keiichi with a sexy video she trys to get him to put the moves on Belldandy.  Of course everything goes completely wrong.  It's just a hiliarous episode.  But I personally wouldn't let anyone under 13 watch it.,994032000,2,348,4.733333333333333
7858048,5,6303996531,"I never even heard of 'Oh My Goddess' until I saw a .jpg file of Urd on the Internet.  There was something about the way she was drawn that was so alluring.  The artistry in this series can convey feelings and emotions  through its characters without even having them use dialogue.  While I am  more of a Robotech or StarBlazers type Anime fan, Oh My Goddess' appeal is  simply irresistable.",931910400,2,391,4.514285714285714
