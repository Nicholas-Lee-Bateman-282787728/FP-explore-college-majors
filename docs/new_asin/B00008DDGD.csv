1834596,5,B00008DDGD,My two year old daughter just loves this movie! I think it's pretty cute. The boys singing voice is a tad annoying but otherwise it's great.,1353888000,4,140,4.423076923076923
1834597,5,B00008DDGD,"I have not watched this, I bought it as a gift for 2 little girls.  It came promptly, there were no problems with the transaction!!",1324425600,,131,4.24
1834598,5,B00008DDGD,My children love this move and call it the Mary & Joseph movie.  They ask for me to play it for them every day.  My daughter has the words and songs memorized.  What a wonderful way to teach them about the nativity. Great job. Thanks.,1264896000,,234,4.155555555555556
1834599,5,B00008DDGD,I am very pleased with this video.  I am going to take it with me when I go to have Christmas with my grandchildren and their parents!  I want to watch this children's version of the Nativity with my grands during the Christmas season.  Merry Christmas to all!,1261180800,2,260,4.375
1834600,2,B00008DDGD,"I agree with a previous reviewer, the animation on this is horrible. It's like they didn't even try to make their characters look decent. I really hate that everyone who does kids' movies thinks they need to throw in songs, especially when the music is as shoddy as the animation. The story and dialogue itself isn't bad. The cover art is deceptive, making it look a whole lot better than it is; they took more time with their contours, coloring and shading. You'd think that it would be a better quality with Charleton Heston presenting it.",1232409600,9,541,4.645833333333333
1834601,5,B00008DDGD,"We bought this movie for our daughter last year she is now 5 years old, and she wants to watch this movie constantly, she really likes it.  Of course we have watched it too, and it is good, the message of Jesus's birth and the miracles he did, and our daughter has learned a lot from it.",1219190400,8,287,4.035087719298246
1834602,5,B00008DDGD,"This dvd is a great cartoon that talks about the miraculous story of the birth of Jesus in a way that kids can learn from and enjoy. In my opinion, the animation is good, the message is good, and so are the songs (my kids love them). In fact, my kids want to watch this over and over again. They also ask lots of questions during the program which leads to good discussion and explanation. Hopefully we will see more of this series made and released in the near future!",1144022400,7,469,4.222222222222222
1834603,1,B00008DDGD,"We love Bible films. This though is awful. The drawings are poor. There is an annoying boy who is supposed to be narrating the story. Every once in a while he breaks out into some horrible catterwailing that is I suppose singing by someone's standard. It's so bad it hurts. He has a horrible voice. Even the lyrics were often awful.

  Please don't waste your money on this it's dreadful!",1134604800,10,388,4.514285714285714
1834614,3,B00008DDGD,My kids were bored with he older man at the start. Once past that the singing was cheesy but acceptable to my toddlers. I doubt they will want to watch it in a few years.,1449100800,2,170,3.8857142857142857
1834615,3,B00008DDGD,"I'm coptic orthodox, and i did't like the idea of Virgin Mary and Joseph were kissing, holding hands and got married. I understand that they were trying to make things look normal, but that is against out belief...",1437868800,2,214,4.657894736842105
1834616,4,B00008DDGD,"It's good to explain what the cartoons leave out, yet, children seem to like the stories and learn a lot from the cartoon versions.",1424649600,,131,4.5
1834617,5,B00008DDGD,"bought this book for my kids when they were little - their favorite.... so I bought one for each of our six grandkids... Their favorite TOO !!  Our son is 41, daughter 39 and daughter 33.",1424476800,,187,4.194444444444445
1834618,5,B00008DDGD,Great movie for kids.  My 4 year old granddaughter accidently broke her copy and I had to order another one right away.  I could tell she understood most of the movie because she was doing reenactments of Mary and Elizabeth with her dolls.,1423094400,,239,4.534883720930233
1834619,5,B00008DDGD,This is the perfect video version of the Christmas story for young children.,1422921600,,76,4.923076923076923

1834621,1,B00008DDGD,"This Movie was OK, biblical but very distracting with the shepherd boy breaking out in song every so offten:-(  the kids I showed it to found it OK for very young kids but not above 6!",1420761600,,184,4.111111111111111
1834622,3,B00008DDGD,Was hoping for a simple nativity story for my four year old. He didn't care for the singing.,1420329600,,92,4.166666666666667
1834623,2,B00008DDGD,The video begins with an elongated commentary by Charlton Heston and did not captivate our 6 yr. old and 4 yr. old grandchildren.  Quite disappointed.,1419552000,,150,5.0

1834629,1,B00008DDGD,"Thought this would have the same animation that is depicted on the covers, but they indeed DO NOT! Very disappointing! The actual animation looks like it's from 1970. Very poor, and bad for business! This is definitely a BAIT & SWITCH item!",1410220800,,240,4.738095238095238

1834633,4,B00008DDGD,"While I enjoyed the way the story was presented, I would just as soon they had left out Mr Heston's introduction. I'm afraid he might cause children to loose interest before the story starts.",1393200000,,191,4.647058823529412
1834634,4,B00008DDGD,It was for the kids to play Christmas Eve night at my place before they open gifts they loved it,1390780800,,96,3.85

1834638,5,B00008DDGD,"We are Catholic and I was looking for a good Nativity DVD for our 4 kiddos, ages 6 and under. This DVD is not Catholic, per se, but as a Catholic I did not see anything in it that went against Church teaching (important to us).

It really is the best animated Nativity DVD I've seen for kids... geared to children and really held their attention. We watched it twice during Advent and the Christmas season, and even our 4 year old, who normally doesn't dig religious cartoons, enjoyed it and asked for it again.

One small quibble: If I could take off half a star I would, because I have a couple of these Greatest Heroes and Legends DVDs and the director always feels the need to include this cartoon boy character singing a cheesy (and long!) song; it is distracting from the story.

But really, for the price (I think we paid around 5 bucks), it's not a huge deal, and overall it's a great re-telling.",1358726400,22,904,4.369047619047619
1834639,4,B00008DDGD,This is very well done for young children.  It keeps their attention and speaks to them in a way they can understand.,1358380800,,117,4.318181818181818
1834640,5,B00008DDGD,It helped my grand daughter under stand the birth of our savior better and got it for Christmas and that helped too,1358121600,,115,4.2727272727272725
1834641,5,B00008DDGD,Never too early to start teaching our children about their Savior and Redeemer as we all need to know of Him! That we may bow before Him and confess He is The Christ.,1356825600,,166,4.0606060606060606
1834642,4,B00008DDGD,I ordered this movie for the Christmas time to share with my catechism class and my three boys at home i am very satisfied.,1355356800,6,123,4.166666666666667
1834643,3,B00008DDGD,"I wanted a movie about the Nativity that covered the main parts of the story in a way that my 4-year-old would get and pay attention to. Yes, this is corny, with colors that are slightly off, amateurish animation, and some very brief, annoying songs. I fast-forwarded through the 4-minute intro and wished I could fast-forward/skip the 4 minutes of previews. We rented it from our video-by-mail service first and, for $5, it fits what I wanted it for. Totally appropriate for the youngest children. It covers the vision of Zacharia, Annunciation, Visitation to Elizabeth, Joseph's dream, census, Herod, trip to Bethlehem, shepherds, star, wise men, and Presentation in the temple. My son asked some great questions and we'll be watching it again in the hopes he picks up more of the story.",1354579200,16,789,4.93984962406015
