7855455,5,6303934188,My 2-year old loves this video!  We must have watched it 10 times in the first weekend we brought the tape home.  My 2-year old son loves watching the large tractors and farm animals and dances around to the fun country music played in the background.  The tape is about 30 minutes in length and keeps my child engaged the entire time.  I highly recommend!,1182297600,,356,4.430769230769231
7855456,4,6303934188,"My 2 1/2 year old son likes this video.  The country-western music isn't too bad--and I'm not a country & western fan.  Dad can still watch this video without going crazy!  There are lots of nice views of a working farm / dairy, and the narration doesn't make you feel like you're being ""dumbed-down.""  All of my Uncles & Grandparents were farmers and it made me feel nostalgic.  This is a good low-key video for anyone who is interested in farm tractors.",1027641600,2,455,4.5
7855457,2,6303934188,This video offers an extremely superficial view of the duties of tractors on the farm. Lots of boring footage from the cab looking at the fields. My 2 yr old son watched this twice and since then wanders off bored after about 3 minutes of the tape. There are better choices out there.,1024444800,,284,4.377358490566038
7855458,2,6303934188,"My 21 month old was saying tractor long before he ever said anything else. He loves to go to the family farm and sit on all the different old tractors and ride them with his daddy. But, this 27 minute video didn't even begin to show much of anything. Just a  couple of tractors riding through a dusty field chewing up some corn and wheat straw. The video promises to show you cows being milked and bales of hay being made......where? We saw cows but no milking machines. We saw square bales of hay being spit into a trailer but no show on the actual making of them. I was so disappointed in this video. People that love it have no clue that they aren't even seeing anything. How about a longer video with ""Big Bud"" and more combine action? 30 minutes is just barely long enough to get a tractor warmed up where I come from.",1020988800,3,823,4.24203821656051
7855459,5,6303934188,"My 22-month old son is crazy about all types of transportation and machinery but has a particular love for tractors.  I ordered this video on a whim and am thrilled with his interest in it.  We've only had it for a week or two but my son asks to see his ""tractor bideo"" probably ten times a day.  He loves it!  The video contains footage of all types of farm equipment, both up close and from a distance.  It also shows children feeding calves from bottles and explains how milk goes from the cow to your cup without too much explanation--just right for a two year old.  There is not a lot of talk in the whole video--just lots of tractors, combines, balers, and cows.  Being suburban family, he never sees this stuff outside of a video--it's exactly what we were looking for.",1006128000,2,776,4.384615384615385
