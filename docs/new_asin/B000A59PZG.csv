2360582,1,B000A59PZG,"I never purchased this movie so I can't very well review it.  However, I did see it on television and wasn't that impressed.",1176422400,2,124,4.391304347826087
2360593,5,B000A59PZG,I rated this five stars because this product was exactly as expected. I saw this movie on Lifetime and I really liked it a lot. I'd recommend it to anyone.,1393804800,,155,4.2
2360594,4,B000A59PZG,"This movie was a likeable movie.  It was a typical movie about initiations within college sororities and the evilness that go on in the sororities and fraternities.  I was aware how the movie would turn out.  No suspense, no excitement, no thrills, etc., but just middle of the road type of movie.  Laurel Holloman plays one of the roles as a mean sorority sister--I do not like seeing her playing mean and evil parts, this is  just my feelings about certain actors.",1389657600,,466,4.634146341463414
2360595,5,B000A59PZG,I am a fan of Lifetime movies and this is one of my favorites. Hilary Swank plays a good role.,1384819200,,94,3.75
2360596,3,B000A59PZG,"The movie was OK, very much ""Made for TV"" but it was alright. If you're a fan of Hilary Swank and/or Mark-Paul Gosselaar then I say go for it, otherwise, Id miss this one.

Hilary Swank does a good job, no big surprise there.  It was kind of cool to see Mark-Paul Gosselaar in something outside of playing Zack Morris.

I watched it a couple of times & then sold it, its definitely not something you need to watch repeatedly. I love how the DVD box says, 2-Time Academy Award Winner thats too funny, trying to push the sales are we?",1365724800,,532,4.247524752475248
2360597,5,B000A59PZG,"I no longer have Lifetime TV, but I remember this movie and it was very good to me. I could see the peer pressure as a young college student trying to keep her values and good hearted spirit not distract her in this fake gamma gamma fake sirority that is all about who you are and not what you are. This was a breakthrough for Hilary Swank and her career.",1364342400,,355,4.085714285714285
2360598,5,B000A59PZG,Met all my requirements and expectations.  One of the best products out there for the cost and expectations for use.,1364169600,,116,4.8
2360599,5,B000A59PZG,"This movie is about a girl who tries to fit in with a sorority. She has to follow their rules, even if they're unpleasant.",1363564800,,122,4.125
2360600,5,B000A59PZG,"Fantastic story of life as most of us don't even know about, these are thing's we don't think about. A very good story to tell",1357776000,,126,4.08
2360601,3,B000A59PZG,"This movie deals with college peer pressure and sororities.
This features Hillary Swank before her mega stardom days, pre- ""Boy's Don't Cry""
& ""Million Dollar Baby"", it is very evident early on, as with this picture, that
Hillary had major talent and was going to be a star. It also stars the side
kick to the star of the 90's tv show ""Blossom,"" Jenna Van Oy, who also gave an
outstanding performance, nothing like her flaky character on Blossom.

I would recommend this to young girls, early teens, and especially parents'
whose daughters are going to be going away for college, it is a must see,
a real eye opener on how far some people will go just to be liked and to fit
in, literally in one girls' case dying to fit in.",1348531200,,724,4.402985074626866
2360602,5,B000A59PZG,"Everyone should get this film. There are bullies everywhere but, the things you'll do to get into a clud or to fit in can get out of hand very quick. This is a perfect movie that all teens should watch.",1343001600,2,202,4.075
2360613,5,B000A59PZG,Love this movie. I'm a Lifetime Movie buff and this one is a good watch! And I love Mark-Paul Gosselaar so it's a bonus that he is in it.,1307318400,,137,3.7586206896551726
2360614,5,B000A59PZG,"tHIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES!!!!!! I LOVE HILARY SWANK. SHE IS AN AWESOME ACTRESS!!!!!!! SOME PARTS OF THE MOVIE MADE ME SO MAD .
 WHEN THEY HAD MENA SUVARIE GET UP ON THE TOWER AND TOLD HER TO PUT THE BANNER UP AND SHE TOLD THEM THAT SHE WAS AFRAID OF HEIGHTS, THEY JUST WOULDN'T LISTEN TO HER. SHE DIED A HORRIBLE DEATH!!!!!!!!! I HAVE WATCHED THIS MOVIE ABOUT A HUNDRED TIMES(NOT REALLY) AND EVERYTIME I WATCH IT I ALWAYS SEE SOMETHING I MISSED!!!!! THIS IS A WONDERFUL MOVIE FOR COLLEGE GIRLS TO SEE. I NEVER WENT TO COLLEGE, BUT IF I DID AFTER SEEING THIS MOVIE I WOULD NOT JOIN A SOROITY!!!!!!! THE PART WHERE THEY HAD THE GIRLS DRESSED IN BIKINIS AND WALK ON THE TABLE AND JUST HUMILIATE THEM WAS SO NEEDLESS!!!!!!! HILARY SWANK PLAYED A FANTASTIC PART AND ALSO MARK-PAUL GOSSALEAR.
  ALL IN ALL, THIS MOVIE WAS EXCELLANT AND WORTH THE MONEY!!!!!!!!",1290038400,,861,4.436708860759493
2360615,4,B000A59PZG,"I'm not a big fan of fraternities or sororities. (If only they really were what they proclaim themselves to be...) The title of this DVD exposes all that could go wrong when people (in any type of organization) are overcome by negativity.

Of course, there are many wonderful organizations out there. Dying to Belong dramatizes only the worst that can happen with the help of some now famous faces. If you enjoy an occasional cautionary tale about girls gone wrong, you'll love this film.",1285027200,,488,4.809523809523809
2360616,3,B000A59PZG,It's something that most people will have an experience in life; but the real thing is being a friend to someone and making a difference. I really enjoyed the movie and the message it relayed.,1256601600,3,192,4.514285714285714
2360617,4,B000A59PZG,"Not great, but entertaining enough--geared toward teenage girls.  I think what really makes it interesting are the familiar faces of Sarah Chalke, Hilary Swank, and Mark-Paul Gossalear, whose acting is decent in an otherwise weak movie.  Plenty of people would hate this movie, but it was worth the money to me.  It's something to watch.",1254614400,,337,5.090909090909091
2360618,3,B000A59PZG,"I thought that this was going to be better that it really was. It was good, don't get me wrong, but it just wasn't what I was expecting. It does, however, show just how bad things can get during that hazing and all that for Fraternities and Sororities",1243123200,4,251,4.25
2360619,5,B000A59PZG,i ordered this product on a monday and i needed it for thursday. i got the movie by wednesday and it was exactly what i needed. thank you!,1240963200,2,138,3.9642857142857144
2360620,2,B000A59PZG,i find this movie to be trash because i could not get into it for nothin so i think it sucks,1228953600,3,92,3.4285714285714284
2360621,5,B000A59PZG,"I first saw this back in college after I had pledged, though my experiance was no where near what was depicted in the movie. My other sorority sisters say the movie and we began quoting the movie ""you want to win the sisterhood award"" and later used it to show our anti-hazing education program to show new members what would not happen to them. Not all Greeks haze, but every Greek should watch this movie!",1193788800,18,407,4.44
2360622,5,B000A59PZG,"I teach ""The Battle of Jericho"" and this video does a pretty good job depicting the hazing issue. My female students enjoyed it more than the males.",1182816000,9,148,4.518518518518518
8074574,5,B000A59PZG,"I am a Hillary Swank fan and this movie about hazing in sororities is a bit hyperbolic, but I wouldn't be too sure if some of these shenanigans actually do happen in certain groups.",1471132800,,181,4.352941176470588
8074575,5,B000A59PZG,"This movie starts slow, but is a really good movie.",1461196800,,51,4.2

8074583,5,B000A59PZG,Another college campus sorority movie. With a different take. You'll like it because of the twists in it. Hillary did an excellent job without taking her close off in this one.,1400803200,,176,4.709677419354839
