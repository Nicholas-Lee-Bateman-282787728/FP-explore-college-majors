3624388,5,B001H5X6S0,"OMG! This may be the grand champion in Cinema Du Sasquatch film lore.  This film contains probably the single most outstanding ""Quality Kill"" that have have ever been recorded in the history of cinema. The Yeti rips a victims leg off and begins to beat the poor guy with his own leg. When the beating is completed, the Yeti chomps his fangs into the severed leg with about two gallons of blood gushing out of detached limb. Immediately following the carnage, the surviving members are running as fast as they can away from the monster and if you look close enough, you will notice that one of the cast members is actually laughing. The monster looks like someone bleached a gorilla suit and bought a rubber mask from the dollar store and spray painted it silver. This is almost like watching a 1950's low budget monster movie where it didn't matter how ridiculous the monster looked. Or maybe, it's like watching a 1970's ""Grindhouse"" flick.
No matter what, it has all the right ingredients to present the viewer with a ""Bigfoot Schlockfest"" that has been surpassed by no other. If you enjoy Bigfoot movies as much as I do, Here are a list of some of my favorites:
1-Sasquatch-The Legend of Bigfoot-1977
2-Snowbeast-1977
3-Creature from Black Lake-1977
4-The Legend of Boggy Creek-1973
5-The Abominable Snowman-1956
6-Abominable-2005
7-Yeti-2008.
There are several others in this genre but unfortunately alot of them are just bad film making and don't contain any spirit or sense of fun as these ones do.
That said, if you are in the mood for a good brain bashing, call some friends over, make sure the beer is cold, and order your pizza very,very cheesy.

3624389,2,B001H5X6S0,"""Yeti"" is not the worst horror movie ever made but it tries pretty aggresively to be. A football team is on the way to the Orient for a exhibition football game.  Their plane crashes in the Himilayas' and then the stupid begins.  The survivors crawl out of the plane and despite the below zero weather they wear lightweight jerseys and shirts. After about 20 minutes, right on cue, someone notices that it is pretty cold.  Everyone agrees and again on cue start to shiver. They search the luggage on the plane and are soon garbed in winter gear-but because we need to see the actors faces, they can survive the frigid weather without ski masks or gloves.

I guess I forgot to mention but the team has brought along some cheerleaders-the movie does need females to shreik in terror whenever they come across the Yeti, which looks like Chewbacca in a white fur coat.

With no food the survivors decide to eat their dead friends and although repulsed at first, they soon begin to chow down on ""leg of Steve"".  They even set up a barbecue spit to cook the vittles.  They have competition for the ""food"" as every once in awhile the Yeti drags off a body to snack on.  The movie was so stupid I was hoping against hope that when the Yeti was dragging a body away, one of the footballers would cry out, ""Hey, the Yeti just stole our lunch.""

There is some gore but only watch this movie on the sci-fi channel-don't waste your money renting it.",1233446400,7,1436,4.450381679389313
3624390,1,B001H5X6S0,"""Yeti: Curse of the Snow Demon"" was released for the Sci-Fi channel in 2008. It tells the story of a college football team suffering a plane crash in the Himalayas where many die, but this is only the beginning of their problems. The surviving members have no choice but to resort to cannibalism, while the cave lair of the Abominable Snowman is nearby. Horror ensues.

Whoa, this has got to be the worst modern film I've seen. It certainly has some positive aspects -- the mountainous British Columbia locations, the actors, the serious vibe (everyone plays it straight and the melodramatic soundtrack backs 'em up), heck, even the Yeti costume isn't all that bad when not overexposed -- but other than these factors this film is truly godawful, so gloriously BAD you have to see it to believe it, so BAD I literally felt sorry for the actors who, again, were all giving it their best shot of seriousness.

Is it so bad it's funny? YES! I was laughing my butt off through every supposedly horrifying, dramatic and horrible-cgi scene (take note -- the CGI work is some of the worst I've ever seen). So, the film's definitely worthwhile as a so-bad-it's-funny piece. This is the only reason I can think anyone would actually be willing to buy it on dvd.

Keep in mind that I'm a very generous reviewer and have the ability to look beyond production deficiencies and glean any goodness from the heart of a film. Take for instance 2005's ""Sasquatch Hunters"" which, like ""Yeti,"" is a made-for-tv grade-B Bigfoot flick. That movie is worthwhile for this type of film as detailed in my long review. The same can be said for ""Abominable"" and ""Sasquatch Mountain"" (the latter being the best of the batch).

Not so with ""Yeti."" This is a modern-day ""Plan 9 from Outer Space."" Don't trust any of the supposed 5/5 Star reviews; they're being sarcastic.

You have been warned.",1233360000,24,1864,4.705521472392638
3624391,5,B001H5X6S0,"The movie Yeti is quite possibly the greatest movie ever made about the mythylogical Yeti/Sasquatch/Bigfoot Character.  In an amazingly believable story, a college football team crashes in the himilayas on their way to an international bowl game.  Lucky for us they have the leadership of star quarterback PEYTON ELWAY to protect a few of them.  From beautiful scenic shots to cannibalistic tendancies of crash survivors to ripped of arms being used to splint broken legs (only to fall off while climbing a cliff) and then reappear back on the leg at the top of the cliff), Yeti is sure to provide hours of spirited discussion following it initial viewing.

  The plot is as typical and highly predicable, but it is fun to wager on who will be the Yeti's next meal.  The special effects are abysmal and consistant mostly of a large man in a latex and white fur ape suit.  There is some very low end CGI which appears to have been added as an after thought.
  The best scene involves Peter DeLouise being tackled by a Yeti and then beaten with his own leg before the Yeti takes a bite of it.

3624400,1,B001H5X6S0,"Warning, spoilers.
Hilariously bad, but not in a good way. The foolishness started when we learn that the football team is flying over the Himalayas while en route to a game in Japan. Where was it supposed be flying from? North Africa? The Middle East? Even though both areas are known for their fanatical fans of American College football, it seems a bit far fetched. Next the plane crashes in a remarkably fair weathered portion of the Himalayas. The survivors sit around looking exceptionally comfortable and discuss their dilemma. They are literally surrounded by small fires as the do so. The very next scene finds them desperately trying to figure out a way to start a fire. The film takes a brief but promising turn when one of the cheerleaders notices that a body is missing from beside of the plane. What could have taken it? Unfortunately we soon find out. The Yeti makes it's appearance, and it appears to be a combination of a cheap, second rate Lord of the Rings Goblin and the Grinch.
It gets worse, not only can the Yeti jump like a bionic kangaroo, it has the ability to change course in mid air (abominable snow gas?).

3624414,3,B001H5X6S0,"This `horror' flick was made for the Sci-fi Channel (before they forgot how to spell it).  It quickly establishes the Yeti and their location in the Himalayas way back in 1972, then the story abruptly continues to ""present day"" (which I took to mean Christmas, but it's not).  A plane loaded to rafters with miscellaneous football players, abruptly hits a storm, which hits back, and they crash in the Himalayas near the cave belonging to the Yeti.  What are the odds?  Unfortunately, only the quarrelsome survive.  They live to argue and fight over who should be in charge (at this point I had absolutely zero confidence in any of them).  It isn't long before their meager snacks dwindle and the bodies of their teammates start to look pretty tasty.  There's one malcontent in their group constantly trying to coerce the rest into mutiny.  That they didn't think to munch on him first was a missed opportunity.  Eventually, help does arrive.  In the meantime, they have to survive each other and the Yeti.

This is a low maintenance horror flick with terrible FX.  The makeup/mask on the Yeti made me cringe.  Worse.  The CGI version of the same had the Yeti hopping around like bunnies!  It was impossible not to laugh in spite of their attempt to play it serious throughout.  It is a mess.  But it did hold my interest (if for nothing else than to see the Yeti pick off the rest of the cast).  So I will say it did amuse me, even though it wasn't meant to.

3624423,1,B001H5X6S0,"I stumbled upon this movie on the Sci Fi channel one day.  Once I started watching I was hooked.  The acting is so bad, the plot is so bad, the special effects are so bar, everything is so bad... that it's amazing, and incredibly entertaining.  I can't stop telling my friends how yeti's can rip the heart out of a living human with one hand.

They're supposed to be an ACC football team from Virginia.  And since there's only 2 black people, it's definitely not Virginia Tech.  Sorry UVA.  They decide to take the long way to Japan, instead of just flying over the pacific, because I mean why not?  makes perfect sense.  Let's not undermine the fact that they're going to Japan to play a football game.  Because the Japanese love American football.  I mean last time I checked at least.

My favorite part is when the chick wakes up and the Yeti is cuddling with her and has his arm around her.  She tries to get up and he's doesn't let her, he wants to keep sleeping/cuddling.  I'm seriously contemplating buying a yeti costume and putting it on before she wakes up the next time I go to bed with a random woman, just to see how she reacts in the morning.

Some other highlights include
1) The black dude dies first
2) The sweet evergreen trees at 18000 feet in the Himalayas.
3) The yeti jumping like 100 feet in one leap
4) Learning that if I ever break my leg, I can use a severed arm as a brace and easily walk 5 miles in the snow
5) The bad ass ways the yeti kills people - one that no one else mentioned was that he killed one dude by tackling him and just started eating the back of his head, or the girl who's head he stomped on and it exploded
6) The QUARTERBACK of the football team making a tackle on the 1200 pound yeti like it was no big deal
7) Hottie Crystal Lowe, though she's never topless which is a shame
8) Learning that yeti's are immune to bullets

3624424,5,B001H5X6S0,"So I stumble upon this masterpiece on SyFy the other night and was immediately hooked.  I didn't see it from the beginning, but in the first scene I watched, some guy is trying to escape from the Yeti and his buddy gets caught and has his arm ripped off.  The survivor then breaks his leg falling down some rocks, but uses his buddy's severed arm as a splint to climb his way to safety.  The movie got progressively worse (or more awesome, depending on how you look at it) from there.  I don't want to ruin it for the rest of you, but other scenes include the guy with the broken leg and severed arm splint getting shot in the face with a flare gun, the Yeti ripping someone's heart out, the Yeti spooning with the token hottie (who somehow stays alive and attractive in just a hooded sweatshirt in the Himalayas), and the star football player laying out the Yeti with a form tackle.  Oh that's right, the Yeti rips off a leg of one of the rescuers and then beats him with it.  I can't figure out if that part or the form tackle part was my favorite.  By the end of the movie I was laughing so hard that my belly hurt.  I highly recommend spending the $15 or whatever to get this movie, have some friends over, get a case of beer, and prepare to laugh your ass off.",1327104000,11,1265,4.176954732510288

3624426,1,B001H5X6S0,"With a ridiculous and unrealistic story, irritating brain-dead characters, terrible dialog, and a less than impressive monster, there is very little good to say about Yeti: Curse of the Snow Demon (2008) a SyFy original movie.

A plane carrying a college football team, crash lands in Nepal during a storm.  The tail section, and wings fall off, but miraculously the front of the plane, manages to land without splintering into a bits.  Fortunately, the survivors don't have to deal with bone chilling winds, or snowstorms.  Mass stupidity seems to be their biggest problem, as instead of using the fuselage for shelter, and putting on whatever clothing they can find, they build a fire in the open, and endlessly debate about what to do.  No survivors get any kind of medical attention, and they are unable to find more than a few energy bars to eat, as apparently almost everything useful was sucked out when the plane depressurized.

Without adequate clothing, gloves, and footwear, the extremities would soon freeze, frostbite would set in, and the survivors would become human popsicles.  But not these people, who survive the Himalayan elements with virtually no protection, and tramping around in the snow in athletic shoes.  About the only thing that is realistic, is the survivors' contemplation of the question of cannibalism.

The Yeti is ugly, carnivorous, and later proves to have quite a spring in his step.  There are several of them, and feed on dead bodies or kill will for a warm meal.  Learning of the crash, a Nepalese rescue station sends two people, (that's all) to provide relief for potentially a planeload of victims.  The ""rescue"" party spots the survivors, but doesn't call in for more help.  Instead they continue to trudge on, finally arriving just after a yeti has trashed the encampment, and feeling a little lonely, has kidnapped a woman.  The action scenes are mostly pathetic, such as when the Yeti are tricked into very quickly dug a trap, followed by an avalanche.

Yeti is part disaster movie and part monster flick, that in the end is just a total disaster.  The special effects are passable, but the story is wretched, and the characters stupid and annoying.  This may appeal to those who like really bad monster movies.  If so, you might want to look for it on SyFy, before you fork out your hard earned cash.",1283644800,,2349,4.8740554156171285
3624427,1,B001H5X6S0,"Remember Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571 that crashed in the Andes in 1972 carrying 45 rugby team members? For three months the remaining 16 passengers survived frostbite, starvation, avalanches, and grievous wounds from injuries sustained in the crash. The survivors became so desperate that they ended up eating their dead companions. After a failed attempt at scavenging a battery from the tail of the plane, the survivors selected two men to climb through the daunting mountain terrain for help.

Now, you and I, being the reasonably sympathetic people that we are, would look upon such a real life event as a tale of man's will to survive and the ugly hunger that drives us all.  The Andes crash is both tragedy and triumph.

Director Paul Ziller knows this story well.  And you know what he thought was missing?

Yetis.

I mean come on.  It's obvious.  This story is just crying out for a yeti or two.

Oh sure, those two men struggled against all odds to escape the icy grip of the mountain terrain...but what if one of them had his arm ripped off by a yeti? And what if the other remaining survivor hobbled his way back to his companions using his dead companion's arm as a splint?

What if one of the rescuers (John Sheppard, played by Peter DeLuise or ""That Guy from 21 Jump Street"") who made the trek back up the mountain to rescue the survivors had his leg ripped off and was beaten to death with it? By a yeti?

At some point during production, costume designer Katrina McCarthy realized a problem:  How is Taras Kostyuk going to get around in the snow as the yeti?  McCarthy's answer is big white three-fingered gloves and yeti boots. It looks as stupid as it sounds.  What's a desperate producer to do?

Brant Mcilroy to the rescue!

Ziller: These yetis look terrible! They stomp through the snow like...well like a guy trying really hard to run in knee-deep snow.

McCarthy: Give me a break, it's keeping the stunt man warm.  They look like real yeti fur!

Mcilroy: I've got an idea.  It's crazy.  But it just might work.

Ziller and McCarthy: Tell us!  Tell us!

Mcilroy: Bumbles...BOUNCE!

Ziller: What?

Mcilroy: Oh sorry, let me translate.  Jumping yetis.  I will make your yetis leap tall snowdrifts in a single bound with a mere flick of my digital pen.

Ziller: ...we have to justify our special effects budget and we only spent fifty bucks on McCarthy's yeti suit.

McCarthy: Hey!

Ziller: Do it.

And thus, ladies and gentlemen, we have the completely unnecessary BOUNCING YETI. These yetis don't just stomp through snow awkwardly, they leap through the air like gazelles, transforming from lumbering oafs to snowdancing fairies filled with murder and rage in a single bound.

But Yeti doesn't stop there.  Oh no. No, Angelina Kennedy, who according to IMDB constitutes the entire art department, obviously had a hand in what I like to call Himalayan Chicken.  What's Himalayan Chicken?

It's the obvious chicken leg you eat when you've just killed a rabbit by spearing it from a distance with a javelin made of airplane parts.  It's supposed to be rabbit, but it looks like chicken. That's because it is chicken, and the actress couldn't be bothered to put her hand in front of the chicken leg, or the director to film it off camera.

Himalayan Chicken is also what dead bodies taste like.  We know this is true because one of the characters comments on it.

And if dead people taste like chicken, and yetis eat people, you know what they must think when they take a bite out of somebody...",1281657600,3,3515,4.6797385620915035

i just wish these lowbrow-pulp film makers would go back to TVC or corporate doco land and let someone with talent and respect for the Yeti do us a descent Yeti film... even the Peter Cushing old classic is a preferable watch than this waste of opportunity.",1249084800,2,1109,4.746113989637306
3624431,1,B001H5X6S0,"I love LOVE bad Bigfoot movies.  Even the really bad ones like ""Sasquatch"" are at least a fun way to kill some time while you drink enough of your favorite distillate to get happy.  But this movie is on a whole different level.  A low level.  A really really low level. One that isn't fun.

For starters, the scene portrayed on the cover isn't even remotely related to anything in the movie.  The Yeti is played by a guy in a horrible white suit that looks like the fx team had about $4.50 and 20 minutes of time to pull together.  It's about 5'6"", but claimed to be over 9 feet tall?!  In other scenes, it looks like the fx crew ripped off scenes from a bad video game.  The cgi most closely resembles a really rough rough cut of a proposed Donkey Kong/Resident Evil crossover.  I was too stunned to laugh or cry.

The actors are equally bad.  Supposed to be a football team from ""State College"", these small, whiny losers look like they're more at home at that place where only D-movie actor-wannabes hang out.  Thankfully, I have no idea where that place is.  It's not even fun trying to figure out who dies next.  I kept hoping they'd all die at once and that the cgi Yet-zombie thing would dance around for the remainder of the movie like the Ogga-Chakka baby.  No dice.

Do yourself a favor and spend your money on something less painful like letting that bratty kid down the block smack you in the kneecap with a sledge hammer for a half hour or so.  You'll thank me in the end.",1244505600,13,1485,4.299638989169675
3624432,2,B001H5X6S0,"""Yeti"" (also known as ""Yeti: Curse of the Snow Demon"") is a horrible but hilarious Sasquatch flick from The Sci-Fi channel with every stereotype and cliche in the book, plus a few new ones. The film features terrible CGI, a ludicrous script, and horrid acting for starters. In a nutshell, a college football team (and assorted random females) from ""State College"" are flying from the US to Japan when they crash in Nepal and are chased by a Yeti. Therein my first problem is revealed: what airline goes from the continental United States to Japan via Nepal? Just a tad out of the way, you say? Well, that is probably the most believable element of the film.

While over the Himalayas, the plane (the filmmakers can't decide if it's a 737, 747, or business jet, but I won't nitpick) encounters a storm and crashes. Suffice it to say that the CGI 747, storm, and plane crash are unbelievably unrealistic for a film made in 2008. Even worse, the whiny cast is so annoying that you may, like me, be hoping the Himalayan Yetis defeat The State College Grizzlies in the Bigfoot Bowl. Not only can't the cast act, but they really don't have much to work with: the script is the only thing worse than the CGI.

After the crash, the cast looks around for food in everyone's backpacks and pockets, but it never even dawns on them to look in the galley before the cannibalism subplot emerges. (A football team stuck in the mountains resorting to cannibalism? Now there's an original idea....) After the coach says something motivating to the handsome quarterback and promptly dies, the cast turns on each other despite the obvious menace that keeps raiding the camp for bodies. The Yeti is very angry, and not only runs, but hops and jumps (you have to see this CGI to believe it) in a menacing way, all the while looking like a cross between Chewbacca with mange, the Cowardly Lion with head lice, and Robert Z'Dar after being in an autoclave. (These filmmakers only wish they had someone of Z'Dar's talent.)

The cast goes hunting for rabbit with a piece of luggage and a stick, but it's the pretty girl who saves the day and brings home the hasenpfeffer in another wholly credible scene. While the main cast is dabbling in cannibalism and honing their survival skills, there are two parallel plots about a brave second-string player in search of the plane's radio who evades the lightning-fast Yeti for five days with two broken legs (!), and a couple of people from the Yeti patrol (or some such nonsense) who are hiking across the mountains to rescue the crash survivors. Their hike through the Himalayas looks more like an outing at Park City, Utah with glorious sunshine and a shallow base of powdery snow. The three disparate elements finally unify, although in the process they validate the old Himalayan adage ""Never let the blowhard jock have the flare gun.""

As the cast converges, they are presented with a quandary: the Yeti has kidnapped the quarterback's girlfriend. Should they look for her or not? Of course they do, and they find her in a cave asleep and spooning with the Yeti. Their plan to rescue her defies belief, and involves digging a deep trench outside the cave in sheer rock, in absolute silence, placing spears in the bottom for the Yeti to fall on, subsequently causing an avalanche to bury the Yeti, but not them. Stunningly, this seems to work, although be prepared for multiple tedious false endings. In the end the football star uses his gridiron skills and tackles the Yeti into submission, taking him out of bounds and off a cliff with an assist from the rabbit slayer. Oh, and the two principals fall in love. Obviously.

This movie is one of the most predictable of all films, and would have been an excellent episode of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000."" It does have good camp value, and is well worth laughing at if you can endure the annoying cast. It has zero value as a ""serious"" monster movie. It is unscary and ridiculous at every turn. The DVD has a trailer, but no other extras, but it is extremely annoying in that it features a long set of previews that you cannot skip at the beginning of the film. As real entertainment this film scores nil, as a film to mock it is off the chart, so I was tempted to average it out and give it three stars, but the previews and irritating cast took it down to two.",1239235200,8,4337,4.598191214470284

Really, you must know the sort of film you are getting when you buy this. It's basic budget horror which doesn't do anything original but rather provides adequate entertainment value. At least there is a coherent story which progresses quite well and provides a satisfactory ending. These 'Maneater Series' films are actually better than a lot of other cheapie horror films that you can buy, even if they are getting a bit dated now (this one is a 2007 film which I'm only watching in 2017).

What I find a bit strange is the content - you don't get any sex or much swearing but you do get lots of blood, limb rending, skull splitting and other inventive ways for the yeti to kill you. This one also deals with cannibalism which I felt was a big mistake in a film which is so lightweight. It's a serious and distasteful subject that didn't get the sensitivity required (if this subject can ever be handled sensitively). Certainly not the type of movie you would get for the kids to watch.

If you like bigfoot horror movies and are prepared to overlook some of the film's shortcomings this one may be OK for you.",1483142400,2,1345,4.526748971193416
