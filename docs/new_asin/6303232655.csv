619661,4,6303232655,"This movie was an old childhood favorite.  Rewatching it, it is not as good as I remember, but that doesn't mean I wouldn't recommend it.  Mandy Patinkin and Glenn Close are both solid comedic actors.  They more than make up for the fact that script leaves a lot to be desired.  This isn't ""Citizen Kane"" quality, but if you are looking for something light for a Friday night, I'd highly recommend it.",1056412800,,401,4.527777777777778
619662,5,6303232655,"I just saw this film today, and i fell in love with it from the start. The story has many a funny moment in it. The problems that result for Glenn Close's character, Jan and her husband Nick, played wonderfully by Mandy Patinkin, due to her being possed by the spirit of Maxie are just too funny. It is a very charming movie, whether it's plausible or not. Aren't movies suppossed to be a break from reality? Well this one is a perfect escape movie. It has charm, laughter, and romance all rolled into one. I highly recommend this film for anyone who wants to enjoy a good laugh, or just wants to have a little fun with their viewing choice...",1027468800,4,643,4.322314049586777
619663,5,6303232655,"this is a great sunday afternoon movie that happens to be on t.v. moment. When Glen Close does her cleopatra impersonation with Harry Hamlin it is major. I love her bye bye blackbird moment and her time in the dance studio, with her old friend. It is a correct fun movie, I have had the chance to work with Glenn and this is the only movie box I had her sign. she also did the Cleopatra quotes for me, delicious!",999388800,3,412,4.1625
619664,3,6303232655,"OK so Maxie isn't a blockbuster and not for every taste (what film is??) and I will admit that had the part of Nick been played by anyone other than Mandy Patinkin I would have liked it less, but I found it entertaining enough.  Even when one is based on the other books and film are two different mediums and shouldn't be so closely compared. Maxie was just meant to be a bit of fun and fantasy and as such is ok.",987033600,7,414,4.048780487804878
619665,1,6303232655,"This film is ... They took a really great story by Jack Finney (author of Invasion of the Body Snatchers) and ruined it.  It was originally called, ""Marion's Wall"" and it was just incredible. Seek out ""3 By Finney"" in the book section if this interests you and don't spoil your memory of it with this tripe.",982800000,3,307,4.385964912280702

619756,5,6303232655,I have loved this movie when I first saw. I don't agree with the reviewer at all. The cast is great and this movie is funny. Ruth Gordon is always fabulous and sad to say this was her last film. I watch it every so often as I purchase the DVD when it was $49. If something happened to my copy I would have to but it again at the higher price. To me it's a cult treasure.,1435708800,,370,3.7564102564102564

619758,1,6303232655,"I purchased this item some time ago to share with a friend. We both saw it decades ago and enjoyed it tremendously. This weekend we were prepared to enjoy it again.  It was extremely disappointing. We tried to get pass the extremely poor sound quality but fifteen minutes in ... it wobbled badly, then stopped. I tried to take the tape out and the back tab came off in the VCR player.  After some very delicate maneuvering in dislodging the tape, I was fortunate that it did not disable my machine. BTW, my VCR played perfectly before and afterwards.",1427587200,,550,4.545454545454546

619760,5,6303232655,"Love this movie.  An innocent, touching anf funny movie about a free spirited 1920's flapper who was destined to be a star but died in a tragic auto accident.  Maxie possessed the body of the tenants of her former home.  Then the fun begins in that the possessor and the possee are as different as night and day.

This was Ruth Gordon's last movie and she was absolutely darling in it.",1419379200,,385,4.380281690140845

619805,5,6303232655,"I would have liked to buy this in DVD.  At this time it isn't available.  It reminds me of Ghost and Mrs. Muir.  Maxie is the ghost
and she is a hoot.  Glen Close is awesome in this movie playing herself and playing Maxie.  Love it when Glen Close realizes
Maxie takes her over and when she looks in the mirror, now this is funny.  Buy the movie and find out what else happens to
Glen Close while she is playing Maxie.",1374278400,3,418,4.036585365853658

619808,5,6303232655,"Enjoy this movie a great deal. It very 80s kitchy, but one of Glenn Close's better comedy roles. She plays a duel character in this movie as the wife of Mandy Patinkin, she's a church office assistant and the fiesty,firebrand
""Maxie"", who was a great superstar of her times in the entertainment field. This dual role makes Glenn's acting abilities shine. She is both down to Earth and crazy party girl all in one.",1346112000,,413,4.594594594594595

619810,5,6303232655,"I love this movie and would love to buy a copy. There are older movies, much more classic than this one that cost much less. Sorry, I'm on a fixed income and can't afford 80 bucks for one DVD. Wish I could buy this great Glenn Close movie, and I don't have a VHS player any more.

619864,4,6303232655,"I saw this film when it first came out, and although....NOT the number one of ALL the best ghost movies of all time, STILL, it's a good watch.  Ruth Gordon, of course, is ALLWAYS a plus, and she makes us cry when confronted by her former vaudeville co-star, Maxie when she is possessed through ""Jan"". I appreciated the film even more, when I read the source: MARIONS'WALL, by the late, Jack Finney.  MAN.....if they made THAT FILM, it would have been even MORE elaborate...STILL, a fun film!!!",1204502400,3,493,4.655172413793103
619865,5,6303232655,I have loved this movie for years. I love Glenn Close in this movie so much. A total departure for Fatal Attraction that's for sure. I love the story line and the relationship between Mandy Patinkin and GC. It's very cute. Can't wait for this to come out on DVD.,1195084800,,262,4.26
619866,2,6303232655,"Great movie,excellent acting and story/line but this product unlike most VHS pre-records is done in EP mode rather than the top quality SP mode (and niether the seller or the price tag would suggest that your'e purchasing anything but the best replication available)  and the tracking static is impossible to control,it's either present at the top of the screen or the bottom.

  Purchasers should be forwarned of this especially if it's their intent to make a VHS to DVD conversion. In fairness to the product,if you can live with the static (from the Tracking)you'll probably find it to be minute enough to look beyond, especially since Maxie (G.Close's)role is that of a Flapper from the Twenties when static was commonplace........",1185148800,,735,5.1

619868,5,6303232655,"I am fortunate to own Maxie on VHS, however over the years the color is beginning to fade and the quality isn't as good as it originally was.  I have watched this movie many time and I have to give credit to Ruth Gordon for the wonderful job that she did in this outstanding movie.  I have been waiting for several years for Mixie to come out on DVD.  This movie won't be a disappointment.  It only continues to get better and better.",1173571200,,434,4.192771084337349
619869,3,6303232655,"I have been looking for this movie in stores, flea markets and rummage sales for many years now (to no avail)  and it has not been on television

for a very long time.  My only comment is what other reviewers seem to have forgotten: RUTH GORDON.  She is so fabulous in her own quirky way in this charming flick, and the flapper dance scene between her

and Glenn Close is priceless.  Don't forget this eccentric and

one-of-a-kind actress!",1107561600,5,439,4.551282051282051
619870,4,6303232655,"This review refers to the MGM DVD edition of ""Maxie""....

 Jan and Nick live quiet, low key, uncomplicated lives. He's a librarian, she is secretary to an Archbishop. They are not exactly the wild and crazy type. Their idea of a big night is peeling away the layers of wallpaper, decade by decade, in their new apartment. What they uncover when they are down to the 1920's, is about to change their lives entirely.

 Flapper Maxie Malone, left her mark here. A once young and promising actress, who met with an untimely death. The free-spirited, outgoing, energetic, contagiously fun ghost of Maxie, returns, inhabits the body of poor Jan and it's anything goes, as she tries to make her mark on the big screen once more. Maxie may be dead, but she's full of life. She wears the couple out with her antics. Will Jan ever get her life back, or will Maxie go on to stardom?

 In the hands of a less adept cast, this may not have the hold it immediatley has on the viewer. Glenn Close is ""Maxie/Jan"", and she is wonderful going back and forth between the dull Jan of today and the exuberant Maxie of the 20's. She does a rendition of ""Bye, Bye, Blackbird"" that is simply intoxicating. You may even want to rewind and watch it again before going any further(I did). Mandy Patinkin is Nick. He is brillant as the befuddled husband, who wants his wife back but also falls for the ghost with the most. Bernard Hughes is hilarious as the Archbishop planning an exorcism, and most delicious of all is the legendary Ruth Gordon. Ruth was Maxie's pal in the roaring 20's and hasn't lost a bit of her charm. It may even be by her summoning, that the spirit of Maxie has returned.

  For some reason, at this time, this DVD is hard to come by. They are quite high priced by the outside sellers. If interested, put it on your wish list or in your cart, and be patient and watch for a good deal(or check with your local video store) Or maybe....MGM will rerelease this for fans so we don't have to pay these out of print prices.

 It's ""the cat's pajamas and the bees knees!""
