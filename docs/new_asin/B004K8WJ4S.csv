4395922,5,B004K8WJ4S,"Just picked up Season One - Part One, Season One - Part Two, Season Two - Part One & Season Two - Part Two at my local Sam's Club at $19.98 for each half season.

I've only watched a couple of episodes, but can tell you that the picture quality is even better than it is on my Dish Network Encore Western Channel where they are currently showing.  Image quality on the Dish channel is 480i by satellite and the colors are much more vibrant and the picture sharper on the new DVD discs.

There are also interviews of some length included, by: James Drury, Roberta Shore, Peter Brown and others.

If you want a super deluxe set, then wait for this special Tin Box package release.  However, if like me, you can't wait any longer for your very own Virginian ""fix"", then trot down to your local Sam's Club and see if they are also carrying them.",1268784000,22,841,4.2974683544303796
4395923,5,B004K8WJ4S,"I am so glad to see that this series is being brought out on DVD and I cannot wait to obtain the whole series (1962-1971).  I know the name was changed from THE VIRGINIAN to the MEN FROM SHILOH and despite not having seen the whole series when it was telecast, I enjoy it so much that I watch it at every opportunity and would like to add the whole series to my collection.  It's a great western series with romance, humour, action and great special guest stars.",1266883200,15,462,4.238636363636363

4395925,5,B004K8WJ4S,I am very glad to see the Virginian is finally out on DVD. The first season is 10 dvd out in May. I remember the series with great fondness. The fist season has many good episodes with  Judge Garth and how he came to adopt Betsy. It also has Trampas at his most charming. I am anxious to see if the old series holds up.  It took a long time to put it on DVD as it was in a 90 minute format. All Were in color also. This is a series worth watching again. Pay careful attention to the guest stars. Many are famous now and were not then.,1266019200,50,534,3.8454545454545452

4395944,5,B004K8WJ4S,"This was by far an exciting time for me as we could not get it when it aired 1962 to 1971 so imagine my delight when it was made available to me. The Virgibian is a major part of the show with Doug McClure :Trampas"" close behind. I personally liked Lee Cobb as the ownwer of Shilo which is the name of the spread. It is dfifficult to imagine one man owming that much land, that many cattle, all the men he needs to run it. Think of the amount of food for such a group not to mention wages. The man who took that job had to love what they did for $40.00 a month and food. Mr. Cobb sometimes does some lawyering which is always so interesting. His daughter Betsy is sweet  but sometimes always where she should not be. I have often stated I like movies without women although I know they are Needed for some parts. It was always great when well known stars played parts in each show. One cannot object to that but it would be impossible to name them all. Barry Sullivan, Bette Davis, Morgan Woodward, and too many names I have forgotten.",1495929600,,1035,4.175

4395987,5,B004K8WJ4S,"What an awesome show. Well-written, original stories with a strong dramatic punch. Incidentally, the packaging says 10 discs, but disc 11 (bonus features) is included in a paper sleeve.",1456444800,,185,5.413793103448276
4395988,4,B004K8WJ4S,"""Just call him the Virginian, everybody does,"" says Molly Wood (Pippa Scott), who, in the first half-dozen episodes or so, is the owner/editor of the Medicine Bow Banner and the object of a gently competitive three-way race between Owen Wister's nameless hero and his two best friends.  And everybody does call him that--including said best friends, freewheeling Trampas (Doug McClure) and sober Steve Hill (Gary Clarke).  The Virginian (James Drury) himself has been foreman of Shiloh Ranch, 15 miles east of Medicine Bow, Wyoming, for several years--a soft-spoken, competent cowman with quizzical features and a quiet manner, who is sometimes ranchowner Judge Garth's (Lee J. Cobb) confidant and sometimes his conscience--yet he remains a man of mystery: at one point Trampas jokingly observes, ""Now you know somethin' about [him]... he had a mother!""  None of which prevents Garth's daughter Betsy (Roberta Shore) from declaring she's ""gonna marry you someday.""

Apart from its 90-minute length (the episodes actually run about 75 minutes once you allow for the nonexistent commercials), this long-running Western--the only one that ever succeeded in such a size--is unique for being set in the 1890's: Wyoming is a state, the Indians are no longer a factor (as, in fact, they were in Wister's original story at least once).  And, like most of the Golden Age TV Westerns, it's inconsistent about its dates.  The Money Cage and Run Away Home are probably set in 1893, as must The Man From the Sea be (Medicine Bow, founded in 1868, is having its 25th anniversary); 50 Days to Moose Jaw references the Panic, so is probably that year also, or perhaps the next.  Strangers at Sundown follows the Johnson County War of 1892, probably by a couple of years.  In Big Day, Great Day, a poster dated 1896 is displayed.  In West, the Virginian says This is Wyoming in 1897 The West [has] changed grown up.  The Devils Children is dated 1898.  In The Accomplice, its June, 1898and Trampas arrived at Shiloh only a year before, where he's present in all the earlier-set segments.  If You Have Tears takes place after the threesomes service with the Rough Riders in Cuba.  At various times three different sheriffs, portrayed by three different actors (John Larch as Neil Brady, Russell Thorson as Stan Evans, and Ross Elliott as Mark Abbott) keep the peace in Medicine Bow.  And Betsy (who turns 15 in the first segment and seems to stay there no matter what year she's supposed to be in) always wears ""short"" skirts (just over the knee or to mid-calf) when she bothers to wear a dress at all.  But for all that, the stories are well done, varying from range wars to excursions to Mexico to explorations of some fairly deep subjects, such as the somewhat pathological relationship between a pair of fraternal-twin sisters or the difficulties of a rancher's barely-grown son trying to live up to his father's image of what a man should be.  And ""grown up"" though the West may be, there are still outlaws and rustlers around, and the Virginian, Trampas, Steve, and even occasionally Judge Garth still wear guns when they ride the range or go into town.  I had forgotten how much I enjoyed it, but I'm glad I bought it, and am looking forward to watching the seasons that follow.",1455667200,,3267,4.868231046931408

It's called the Virginian so one would think he would be in every single episode.  I know they did this to allow Doug and Gary to showcase their work.

Can you imagine a show today with 30 pisodes per year lasting 90 minutes?THE VIRGINIAN had of course already a life before the series. It was a novel published in 1902 and there were at least four films including two silents and a version with GARY COOPER,and another one with JOEL MaCRAE,both faithfull to the book. Signifiant changes were made for the series:MOLLY the schoolteacher from VERMONT does not marry THE VIRGINIAN;she is now a journalist on a local paper. The character actually disapears completely at mid-season. TRAMPAS is more likeable in the series than he was in the movies;STEVE is not as much a follower of TRAMPAS's evil ways in the series and BETSY was created for the series. Many great guest stars on this first year like BETTE DAVIS and GEORGE C.SCOTT and a few others. My favorite episodes among many others are the one with BETSY's real father coming in  the ranch to reclaim his daughter that was adopted by judge GARTH and THE MAN WHO COULDN'T DIE with VERA MILES as guest star. JAMES DRURY was ideal to play THE VIRGINIAN and so were DOUG McCLURE as TRAMPAS and LEE J.COBB as the judge. It is fun to watch those wonderfull westerns again.",1426118400,,1441,4.764

I was thrilled with the cast, the realistic staging of story line with scenery all complimented by the stellar acting and 90 minute air time:  What a treat!!  One of my all time favorite episodes is of Trampas and his unexpected sojourn with a, ""broken down"" farrow dealer portrayed by Anne Francis and two (2) Mexican children (one of which was the younger brother of Ron Howard) attempting to reach their mother. When the INSPIRATION Channel announced ""Saddle Up"" Saturdays which included The Virginian, I was thrilled!!

Lee J. Cobb,Doug McClure,James Drury and the whole cast give good performances.one other thing that struck me about the show was the first season being filmed in color,now that may sound a little strange but living in Australia we never had color on TV till 1975 and most of our TV productions of the early 70s were filmed in BW. anyway I'm enjoying it great stuff.",1406678400,,720,4.6328125
4396043,3,B004K8WJ4S,"I had seen this show on Encore Westerns a few years ago and really liked it.  It's nice to have it on DVD now to see it from the beginning.

My 3-star rating is mostly due to the product issues and not the show.  I really like season 1 so far and would give it 5 stars.  However, I've had nothing but problems with every order.  I had this set 3 times and every time disc 3 had production issues with the episode Impasse (2nd episode on disc 3).  Every disc would not play that episode on 3 computer drives (2 Blu-ray and 1 DVD) and 2 stand-alone Blu-ray retail units: one a Sony and the other a high end Oppo.  About 30 minutes into the episode, the show would either jump to the end credits or rewind to the beginning.

After the 3rd bad set, I emailed Timeless Media Group (info@timelessvideo.com) and eventually got a replacement disc 3 that worked.  It's obvious to me that they have a bad batch of badly produced DVDs (disc 3 specifically).  So if you've had this issue, you may as well contact Timeless directly to get a replacement since it looks like they have a lot of these bad discs out there.  Two of the orders were from separate vendors.

Each week was a different adventure for The Virginian, Trampas, Judge Garth and Steve Hill. Although the Virginian, Trampas and some of the other characters wasn't always on the show every week it still was a great show to watch. Judge Garth (Lee J. Cobb) played the Judge and owner of the Shiloh ranch from 1962 to 1966. After that different actors came in and took over Shiloh ranch. The Virginian was about a cowboy back in the 1890's in the Wyoming territory. He was hired on to be Judge Garth's ranch foreman. The show always had the best of that era's actors on their show like Lee Marvin, Charles Bronson just to name a couple. It was the first hour and a half TV western of it's time to air on TV each week. If you like westerns I would highly reccommend buying this 11 dvd set. Sandra K.",1393891200,2,908,4.315789473684211

Another reviewer mentioned that the discs are hard to remove from the sleeves, which is true.  I also noticed one or two brief skips from one episode, but otherwise the discs play great and I like the fact that each episode is 75 minutes - very unusual.

4396059,5,B004K8WJ4S,"Things were a lot less complicated when the western ruled evening TV lineups.  THE VIRGINIAN was the cream of the crop: 90 minutes each week, top guest stars, and a chance to escape from the tensions of the world.  I was a career enlisted Navyman and didn't have a pot.  JFK was President and Vietnam was beginning to intrude into my everyday life -- at home and aboard ship.  I looked forward to this TV program and its characters who were stand-up guys.  Morality was important to them but so was justice and doing the right thing.  It was just good.  And it still is.  TIMELESS MEDIA has done a bang up job transferring the series to DVD,  This particular set (the first) contains more than 39 hours of program.  Some guest stars include George C.

The dvds are well packaged and the transfers done very nicely. The set contains 10 discs and a bonus of interviews with Drury, Clarke and Shore. Packaged in a sturdy box, however the bonus disc is loose and in a plastic sleeve. No complaint with that though, since there was no space available to peg the bonus disc within the box.

4396086,5,B004K8WJ4S,"Here are some impressions of the first season of this classic series, based on some individual episodes.

WOMAN FROM WHITE WING -- Guest star, Barry Sullivan
Betsy's biological father, now an outlaw, threatens to take her away. Series' second episode is one of the all-time best, with a terse script and edgy direction by Burt Kennedy. Sullivan gives an icy portrayal of a lost man consumed by bitterness.

THE BIG DEAL -- Guest star, Ricardo Montalban
A Colombian's land dispute with Judge Garth reaches the brink of violence. Fine episode is carried by Montalban's debonair charm. Pippa Scott's aloof Molly Wood character burdened the series and was soon dropped.

THE BRAZEN BELL -- Guest star, George C. Scott
Cowardly schoolteacher tries to summon the courage to oppose two escaped convicts holding his students hostage. Pulsating episode, written by Roland Kibbee and directed by James Sheldon, showcases Scott's virtuosity. His paralyzingly fearful character is the polar opposite of his later brash, bold Gen. Patton, but it's performed with the same searing intensity.

IMPASSE -- Guest star, Eddie Albert
The Virginian and crew drive a herd of horses down a mountain range despite predatory opposition from the Kroeger clan. Drury and McClure demonstate their cowboy credentials with some magnificent wrangling in this atmospheric outdoor drama. Albert, who made a career out of playing amiable second bananas, proves equally adept as a despicable character.

IT TOLLS FOR THEE -- Guest star, Lee Marvin
Desperado carrying a grudge kidnaps Judge Garth, with The Virginian, Trampas and Steve in hot pursuit. Deluxe episode directed by Samuel Fuller features a titanic clash of wills between Cobb and Marvin and culminates in a memorable shootdown.

THE DEVIL'S CHILDREN -- Guest star, Charles Bickford
An aging hardscrabble rancher can't control his wild offspring, leading to bloodshed. Solid episode, very capably directed by William Witney, presents an enlightened brief on following the rule of law instead of kneejerk retribution. Bickford took some steps up the social ladder four years later when he became the new patriarch of Shiloh ranch.

THE ACCOMPLICE -- Guest star, Bette Davis
Held-up bank teller knows Trampas is innocent of robbery but sees financial gain in refusing to clear him. The teller role gives Davis a part worthy of her talent and stature. She dominates her scenes, of course, but Drury and McClure hold their own.

IF YOU HAVE TEARS -- Guest star, Dana Wynter
The Virginian's attempt to help an army buddy framed for murder entangles him with the victim's widow. Drury works overtime to kindle some sparks in his romantic scenes with chilly Wynter. The secondary pairing of McClure with young Nancy Sinatra is more interesting but not developed. Pre-Man from U.N.C.L.E. Robert Vaughn gives a stylish performance as Wynter's weak brother.

THE SMALL PARADE -- Guest star, David Wayne
The Virginian, Trampas and Steve pause on the way home from a cattle drive to help a gaggle of orphans, their caretaker, a chimp and a vegetarian out of a tight spot. Light-hearted episode takes advantage of the relaxed camaraderie between Drury, McClure and Clarke, a vital series component lost forever when Clarke departed early in season three.

A DISTANT FURY -- Guest star, Ida Lupino
A respected townswoman who is actually a crook commits murder and casts suspicion on Steve. The generally under-utilized Clarke gets a rare starring gig. Lupino's performance shows some of the explosive energy that made her a star. Sixties sexpot Joey Heatherton adds some sizzle as Lupino's daughter.

THE MOUNTAIN OF THE SUN -- Guest star, Dolores Hart
The Virginian leads a team of missionary women into hostile Indian territory. Tall-tale adventure seems at odds with the series' mature bent, but Drury and Hart make it work. Hart's do-gooder role anticipates her real life decision to abandon show business and become a nun.",1328659200,5,3941,5.190551181102363

When I saw that Amazon was now offering it I jumped and bought the first two seasons. I tell you what it is like living my childhood all over. I love it!!! The Virginian was filmed entirely in color and the remastering of the old series is amazing. The production values of that day still holds up.  James Drury, Lee J. Cobb, Gary Clarke, and Doug Mcclure are fantastic. Roberta Shore as Betsy is sweet as one could be.  I can't wait to purchase the future seasons.

4396093,4,B004K8WJ4S,"Once again, like Wagon Train, found a discounted price (around $40) for this first season and bought it here on Amazon.  We started to watch ""Wagon Train"" and ""The Virginian"" on the Encore Western channel and really enjoyed them both debating back and forth which one was the best.  The Virginian was in the fourth season and we pondered how the Virginian got his name and other background stuff.  We enjoyed the episodes we had watched on Cable so we decided to buy the first season to see what we could learn about the series.  Some episodes are great and some are not so good (like 5 on a scale of 1-10).  Overall, we really like the first season and it is our favorite show to watch at night when we have time.  The 90 minute format gives plenty of time to develop the characters, once they realized they needed to do so.  We bought the book ""The Virginian on TV"" and found it quite good and helpful in giving us insight into the uneven first few episodes.  We agree with the author that the first several episodes tend to concentrate on the guest stars and not developing the main characters.  However, as with ""Wagon Train,"" ""The Virginian is great entertainment in a time when TV is seriously devoid of good drama/adventure shows.  Anyone who enjoys a good old western/adventure/drama will love this series.  Not worth full price ($70, but well worth discounted price around $40.",1308528000,,1386,4.59349593495935
4396094,5,B004K8WJ4S,"In the 1950s and 60s there were more than 30 weekly TV westerns on the air, but only a handful were worthy of note and have stood the test of time.  Aside from ""Gunsmoke,"" ""The Virginian"" is in a superior class of its own.  What distinguished these exemplary westerns from the rest of the pack was great writing, perfect casting, and better acting than the stars are typically given credit for.  ""The Virginian"" was particularly exceptional in each of these areas.  This DVD set brings home that point in beautifully restored prints of the show's first season, one of its best.  Among ""The Virginian's"" strongest suits was its ability to focus a story on any one of the main characters and produce a great episode.  Each character was strong enough to stand alone, while stories that combine the talents of all or most of the cast were particularly enjoyable.  I'm looking forward to viewing all nine seasons of ""The Virginian"" on DVD.",1308268800,3,935,4.734567901234568
4396095,5,B004K8WJ4S,"What a classic western the series it was during the 1960s. James Drury shines as the Shiloh ranch foreman known only by the title character. Doug McClure is also brilliant as a one-name ranch hand, Gary Clarke is also good as another ranch hand with a full name, Steve Hill. Lee J. Cobb also excels as Judge Henry Garth, the owner of the Shiloh, and of course, Roberta Shore as his daughter, er let's say his adopted daughter, Betsy, for you see, in an early episode that would have made Maury Povich proud,it was revealed that a friend of the judge is her father! Everything is great about this series, guest stars, writing, diredtion, and Percy Faith's theme and music scoring makes ""The Virginan"" a truly great TV western series of its era!",1304812800,2,743,4.593984962406015

The production of this series was superior to any of the other westerns at that time.  I love the character development and the relationships that they had with each other.  Doug McClure, James Drury, and Gary Clarke were wonderful together. And handsome Doug McClure as Trampas brought so much energy and emotion to his character.  It's just so nice to be able to sit and watch a quality program like this and be reminded of those great days of westerns on tv.

4396102,5,B004K8WJ4S,"Like others have said, The Virginian is based loosly on the novel.
Anyway, I was looking on the Dish Guide one day, and found this series called ""The Virginian"" on Encore Westerns. The story line isn't violent, and usually gunplay is pretty rare.  I've seen almost all the episodes up to season three, and Clu Gulager is a great addition to the show. I know Betsy leaves the show in a few episodes, and I'm going to miss her! She is such a sweet lovable type of girl! She doesn't flirt, and is genuinely nice! Randy Boone really added to the show with his music. It's a good quality, and I love his and Betsy's duets. I truly miss Gary Clarke as Steve, now that I'm in season 3,  but Clu Gulager as deputy sheriff Emmett Ryker can just about fill his boots!

The Virginian is always new and fresh. It doesn't repeat itself, over and over. Even the ""funny"" episodes are pretty good. The theme song is great too! Like I said, I love the show. I can't help bragging about it! It has a genuine quality to it. If you have never seen it, you are seriously missing out.

I love westerns,for some reason they just are in their completely own catheogory, creating a complete own type of world of men, guns and honour and everything. The Virginian has all the best elements that make westerns. Every episode is a classic. The scriptwriters really earned their salaries by creating fantastic stories and characters who were all played to perfection. The show is full of famous guest stars, including Harrison Ford, Charles Bronson, Lee Marvin, Robert Redford, William Shatner, Brian Keith and so many more that its impossible to remember everyone. A good tip- if your parents were young in the sixties and you want to know what shows were hot then, the Virginian is a good show to understand them. I was little over 20 years old when they started showing reruns of it in Finland and I loved to watch every episode of it with my parents because somehow it made a connection between us three when we all loved watching them together. And the dvd box itself is one of the most beautiful boxes available, really well done tinbox. Gives more honour to the great tv show that it is.

4396110,1,B004K8WJ4S,"THIS IS PURELY A TECHNICAL REVIEW:
The embossed tin box is really awesome, congrats. The book-style disc-holder looks also great, but it is so unsuitable for storing discs! They are stuck between two pages that are glued together. So they get scratched everytime you take them out or force them in. And you need to put your fingers on the discs to do so.
Imagine the state of these discs once you're done watching the whole show once!

As for the coding of these dvds, here it is: The discs are coded so that you will NEVER see at what point of the show you are, there is no running time displayable on either dvd-player display or on the screen. I can't believe they still makes these dvds. They did the same with most Will & Grace dvds in the UK.
These are 90-min shows, how can you not let people see how long they are, at what moment they are in the show?
And then, there are only 3 chapters for show: One right after the main titles (so like, after 1 minute in), one during the episode (can't tell you where because...well, you can't tell, there's no running time displayable!), and one right before the end titles.

Some real genuises put together this package. I sure hope the next seasons are released in cheap boxes, at least they won't get scratched by taking them out or putting them in.

So far probably the LEAST practical DVDs I have EVER seen!",1288656000,32,1358,4.380952380952381
4396111,5,B004K8WJ4S,"There was drama behind the scenes in network TV-land in early 1962, and it was drama that helped create the classic show The Virginian. At that time NBC's top-rated show--and in fact the number one show for all of American TV--was Wagon Train. But it was contract renewal time for Wagon Train, and at the beginning of 1962 ABC made a bold move and legally ""stole"" Wagon Train from NBC by offering the makers of the show a better deal. So, NBC lost their top show and money maker. They were mad, but more than that they were going to get even, no matter what the cost. And so opposite their former show Wagon Train, which was a fairly elaborate hour show done in black and white, NBC put on a new ""super Western""--an unprecedented 90-minute show done in full color, which at that time was rare and pretty costly. The Virginian was probably the most expensive show on TV when it debuted in the Fall of 1962. Each episode had a budget of about $350,000 (about $3 million today--if you could even make a show like this today), and was basically an attempt to create a good little Hollywood Western movie each week. Each episode had a top guest star, like Lee Marvin, Bette Davis, Ricardo Montalban, etc. The Virginian steadily climbed in the ratings vs. Wagon Train, and in a few years the formerly top-rated Wagon Train was off the air. NBC had won with The Virginian on their side.

The guest stars are great on this show, but the continuing cast is just as impressive. James Drury does an amazing job bringing The Virginian to life. The Virginian to me (and I know this may sound silly) is a little bit like a combination of Mr. Spock and Captain Kirk. He's in command and has a sense of humor and charisma like Kirk, but he's almost coldly logical and ethical in working out his decisions most of the time. He's a thinking person's hero who really doesn't like to draw his gun often, and hates to kill. There are sometimes shoot outs in this show, but mostly it's a drama set in the West, not a shoot em up kind of show. Co-starring is the charming Trampas, wonderfully played by the very handsome Doug McClure. He's full of wit and fun, but is a good guy too--if not as responsible as the V. I think there are a lot of ladies who are fans of these gents--who by the way sometimes have scenes with their shirts off!

I've watched about a dozen episodes so far. Some are better than others, obviously, but so far they set a pretty high standard for a TV show. It seems more like watching a good B-Western movie to me than watching a tv show, esp. when you compare it to some of the other Westerns that were on the air in 1962. The Virginian gets my vote as the best Western of the 1960s. Even if you don't normally go for Westerns much, you might give this one a try. And if you like Westerns you owe it to yourself to watch one of the best. You have to slow down a little to watch this show--it's not about action, shooting, and fast cuts all the time, but more about drama, character development, and a bit of humor.

One of the most famous fans of this show was former president Dwight Eisenhower. When the network messed up one of the episodes one night by showing the reels of film out of order, he called up the network himself to complain!

The picture quality is very good. Now this is a DVD, not a blu-ray (it would look great in that format, I think, but it's never gonna happen) so don't get your expectations too sky high. But on these fine DVDs it probably looks better than it did when it was broadcast at the time.

PS I agree with the newer review that the packaging and disc authoring are less than ideal. It's still a good show, however, and my discs so far have worked fine.

  If anything, the packaging is too fancy.  It is a little tricky to remove the individual discs from the ""book"" packaging, but that's a small quibble.  Every disc I removed from the book had a fingerprint smudge, so it's obvious it takes a bit of effort at the factory to package these.  Just a few scratches to report.  Timeless Media Group--like every other company--seems to have a hard time packaging discs without scratching them.  In comparison, I've never bought a new cd that EVER had a scratch.  What is it about dvds and scratches?  The top side with graphics are always mint...but the all important play surface with data is often like playing Russian roulette.

But hopefully this is the start of the whole series making it to dvd.  Unlike another reviewer I love the fact that this is a thinking person's western.  Just enough dialogue and action.  Time to develop characters...like a mini movie.  I loved this show as a child in England and had a crush on James Drury.  He still makes my heart flutter!,1279411200,5,451,4.373493975903615
4396126,5,B004K8WJ4S,"The first official release of the Virginian on DVD has been a long time coming and it was worth the wait. The embossed collectors tin is too good to sit on the shelf with your other DVDs, I will be putting mine on display. The discs themselves are contained in a minature version of a hardback book with a disc to each page (even though they are a little difficult to get out) so full marks for packaging. Yes I am delighted to say the episodes are in pristine condition looking better than I have ever seen them before, plus a bonus disc of cast interviews. I always regarded The Virginian as the ""thinking persons western"" and it is evident here. The episodes now seem slow and talkative but the stories are good. It was never supposed to be a ""shoot em up"" western but a series that told good tales. One thing that always intrigued me was James Drury's cord shirts that he wore throughout the series and when I was a teenager I managed to buy a red cord shirt similar to his. Of course we will always wonder about the Virginian's name and also what Trampas's first name is! But as these were never revealed in the original book the series was based on, I guess we will never know. I watched every episode when the series was shown here in England on BBC television so this release was eagerly awaited by me. Worth getting? You betcha!!",1279152000,3,1338,4.356

To anyone looking to purchase this boxed set - do so.  The quality is good.
What really counts here is that I can go back and see the series in order and just have something fun to watch that is not filled with extreme violence, bad language, etc.  If only this quality of TV series could be produced today!!
Buy it....the more sold, the better chance all of us fans will have to have Season 2+ become available,  Enjoy watching a great western with great story themes.

4396130,4,B004K8WJ4S,"If my memory serves me correctly, it was back in 1966 when this was first screened by BBC2 on a Monday night at 8:00.  The most unusual thing about the show was that it had a screen time of just under 1hr:20mins (no adverts). I always enjoyed this show, and was disappointed when it ended to be replaced by The High Chaperal, which I think started around 1970 - so I am not sure that the BBC screened all 8 seasons - possibly just the first four.

Onto the DVD review - I could have done without the tin box, not sure what purpose it serves, but I do like the way they have produced the book to house the DVDs, although they are somewhat diffficult to remove from the slots.  The video quality is good for a show from the early 60's although I have only watched the first episode, but assume the remainder will be as good. I 've always liked the characters, but found this first episode a little pedestrian - maybe it's because I am older now, and I did not like the Hugh O'Brien character(ex Wyatt Earp). The interviews with James Drury and other co-stars was good to have too, and revealed quite a lot.  Will I buy number 2 when it comes out - I'll wait and see if the action picks up, but interesting to hear in the interviews that the TV companies were forced to reduce the action/fights/gun play because of the PTA.  Good to have in the collection and for childhood or rather teenage memories.

But for now,  I am just waiting for the release of Season 2 of what I consider is the best TV Western show from the 50/60's - CHEYENNE.",1278201600,8,1535,4.236301369863014

4396134,2,B004K8WJ4S,"Having not seen ""The Virginian"" when it appeared on television, due to evening work, I was in no position to really know what the series looked like.  I am a long time Western fan and therefore was very interested in seeing this series.  Having looked at the reviews I thought that the series looked well worth a look, so I ordered it

Now, this not a cheap set to buy, especially with 17.5% taxes added etc, but I thought it could be worth it from the reviews.

How this series has got good reviews I do not know and how it lasted 8 years or so I do not know.  All the characters do is talk, talk, talk, action is virtually nil on what I have seen so far. This series comes at the very bottom of the western league, Bonanza, Gunsmoke and others I could name are 10 times better.

It has to be said that the Video quality so far seen is good, the sound quality is generally ok but the level wanders a bit.  This is about one of the most actionless westerns I have seen for a television series.  I feel I have wasted my money.

Some might say that this is a thinking person's western, they would be right because all the characters seem to do is think and just talk. As for Doug McClure and Gary Clarke's characters, they lack personality.",1276905600,9,1238,4.189873417721519

i really think they are cutting corners these companies and they don't ask the customer how they feel about it. just rush it out it so people can buy it and then let there hopes be shattered by trying to fix it on your own,
and this also goes for the whole box set of the WILD WILD WILD WEST collection boo,

I remember seeing this series as a child. It was shown friday evenings on bbc telelvision,so we had the privilege of watching the show without any adverts interrupting. Even though i loved westerns,as a young boy i found the series a little dull. It had too much talking and not enough gunfire or deaths in each episode. As an adult i can begin to fully appreciate this show. It oozes class and pedigree. The episodes are well written,acted and beautifully photographed. The list of guest stars in the first series is a who""s who of hollywood and tv stars. The first few episodes i""ve watched boast guest stars such as lee marvin,bette davis,robert vaughan,nancy sinatra and dana wynter. One show is even directed by the legendary sam fuller with lee marvin at his most evil as one of the bad guys. This set is lovingly remastered and produced in a set that gives the series the treatment a series of this stature deserves.

4396139,5,B004K8WJ4S,"Until ""The Virginian"" bowed on NBC in the fall of 1962, Westerns were relegated to either half-hour or one-hour time slots.  The network took a chance, counting on the popularity of Westerns at the time, to expand a weekly Western series to 90 minutes.  The gamble paid off.  The show ran through 1971, chalking up a total of 249 episodes.  ""The Virginian"" is the third longest-running TV Western, behind only ""Gunsmoke"" and ""Bonanza.""

""The Virginian - The Complete First Season"" contains all 30 full-color episodes from the first season.  The 1902 Owen Wister novel on which the series was based was set in the town of Medicine Bow, Wyoming in the 1890's, and chronicled the lives and relationships of the people who came west to settle the wild land.  The title refers to a man of mystery whose past was unknown.

The novel was first adapted to the screen as a silent picture directed by Cecil B. DeMille.  There was another silent film in 1923 and then the 1929 sound version starring Gary Cooper as the man with no name.  Joel McCrea reprised the role on the big screen in 1946. The story was one of the best known in the genre by the time it hit home screens.

For the TV series, James Drury starred in the title role as foreman of the Shiloh Ranch.  Doug McClure portrayed Trampas, a devil-may-care lovable rogue, and Lee J. Cobb played patriarchal figure Judge Garth, owner of the Shiloh Ranch.  Gary Clark, Pippa Scott, and Roberta Shore rounded out the cast of regulars.

Filmed mostly in the greater Los Angeles area, on the back lots and sound stages of Universal Studios and at surrounding ranches, ""The Virginian"" was strengthened by A-list guest stars.  In the first season, George C. Scott, Lee Marvin, Bette Davis, Robert Duvall, Brian Keith, Colleen Dewhurst, Hugh O'Brian, Gena Rowlands, Jack Warden, Ricardo Montalban, Fabian, Eddie Albert, Vera Miles, and Ida Lupino guested.

 The Collector's Set is packaged in a handsome, embossed tin container. In addition to the entire first season, the set includes a bonus disc containing interviews with star James Drury and cast members Gary Clark, Roberta Shore, Robert Fuller, and Peter Brown.",1274486400,65,2159,4.839237057220709
4396140,5,B004K8WJ4S,"I couldn't wait for the May release of this fine series either so I picked it up at Sam's Club. This has to be the most beautifully photographed of all the classic TV Westerns. Another reviewer mentioned each episode was like a mini-movie, and this is true.

The storylines are credible and entertaining, and the cast is stellar.  LJ Cobb is in a category by himself, of course, but having watched the first two seaons on Encore Westerns (and then again on the DVDs) I'd forgotten what a genuinely good actor James Drury was.  Ditto for Clu Gulagher and Doug McClure.  And while I am enjoying the later episodes, I must confess I miss Gary Clarke's ""Steve"" and the chemistry the three main leads--Drury, McClure and Clarke--displayed during the first two seasons.

One of the things I find enjoyable is how ""real"" the series plays. The guy that played Randy carps about this in the book written about the series (especially how the horses were handled?) but I beg to differ. Within the constraints of the time it was filmed--the 60s and 70s when all the actresses had the wrong hair and makeup for the Victorian Era, and even the dim saloon interiors were lit up bright as day--The Virginian looked as real as it could get. It's one of the few Western series that actually took advantage of the vistas--we get plenty of sweeping shots of Shiloh, etc.--and low and behold! When the script called for it, Drury and Co. were actually portrayed as scruffy, dusty and *bearded*.

And another thing: They actually herded real cattle and horses. I don't recall that happening on any episode of The Big Valley. And did any of Ben and his sons ever sport a five o'clock shadow, even when they'd been out riding the trail for days, away from the ranch house and hot water?

Finally, the leads could all actually RIDE. I'm talking about Drury and McClure here, especially, as both of them are perfectly at ease with horses, on the ground as well as astride, but all actors that were supposed to be working cowboys look credible riding. LJ Cobb, not so much--I can see where they shot and edited some scenes to cover his unease but even that doesn't detract. After all, the Judge is the boss--he's not a range rider. It's conceivable that while he might be comfortable around horses that he wouldn't be a crack rider as his hands would have to be.

Now, as to the quality of the DVDS: They are excellent. They look sharper played in my upscaling Blu-Ray player than they look on Encore, and that's saying something.  I was afraid we would be short-changed when it came to the transfer quality but someone took pains to make the DVDs as pristine as possible. I'm sure it helps that the original series was such a high quality production to begin with. I haven't gotten to the bonus tracks yet as I am still savoring the episodes.

So when do we get Season Three?",1271980800,95,2849,4.568627450980392
