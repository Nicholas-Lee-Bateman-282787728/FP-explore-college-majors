8295885,2,B001E0V6VW,"This is a compilation of footage, and for that it is great however the video is disorganized and there is no narration so it is difficult to watch, particularly if you were not there or do not have someone who can narrate it with you.",1362182400,,234,4.222222222222222
8295886,1,B001E0V6VW,Don't waste your money. You can get better footage off you tube for free. The camera pretty much followed the marines as they breach one door then the next.,1347321600,,156,4.413793103448276
8295887,4,B001E0V6VW,A very good report about the Marines in this operation to understood what they have to do and how they made it. Understand that not show the total fear  about fighting and killing. Mike from Germany,1322265600,,198,4.5
8295888,2,B001E0V6VW,"I was in Fallujah for this operation and missed all the broadcast news coverage at the time.  I was hoping to see...well, something more than what I got.  I would have been mildly disappointed if someone had given this to me for free.",1301961600,,234,4.4186046511627906

The movie must have been made by the PC-Committee & the I-hate-America clowns. It does NOT focus on the battle of Haditha at all but rather on a single incident of that bloody town. It puts Americans down and the Iraqis glorified.
The movie has nothing to do with the title except location.

8295890,4,B001E0V6VW,"Bought this for my husband, who was in Fallujah during Operation Phantom Fury. It was a bunch of random film footage by some Marines.  Neat, except other branches of the military fought in the battle too.",1293408000,,204,4.666666666666667
8295891,2,B001E0V6VW,"interesting combat footage.  since the film is ""as shot,"" it can be a bit difficult to follow at times.  the best aspect is that it shows what really happened rather than someone's version.  given that there are no actors, no real editing involved, cost should be in line with other videos.  appears only effort involved was copying, so why so expensive?  I'ld pass given the ""bang for the buck.""",1284681600,,396,4.681159420289855
8295892,5,B001E0V6VW,"This footage appears to have been filmed by cameraperson embedded with a group of US soldiers.  The video itself is high-quality footage, very clear picture and sound throughout the video.  At 3-hours long, it is indeed packed with ALOT of footage.  The camera follows different groups of soldiers going through the neighborhoods and houses of Fallujah, Iraq in the day and night.

If you are looking for raw footage then this is for you, as the camera is in the middle of soldiers the whole time.  You get to see alot of the weapons in operation that soldiers are using in Iraq - machine guns, tanks, missile launchers, grenade launchers, etc as well as tactics they use to clear out neighborhoods and houses of weapons and insurgents.  Alot of maching gun fire and alot of things being blown up by the ground troops.  You get to see what the neighborhoods, buildings, etc and environment look like.  (which is what i hoped to learn by watching this film - what it looks like in real-life, not in a movie or video game).  You get to see what Iraq war looks like on the ground, from the soldier's perspective.

From what I saw there is no clear footage of living/moving targets being destroyed and no dead people in this film.",1266883200,3,1226,4.58256880733945
