4666547,3,B005ELVCPW,"The most annoying aspect of Discovery shows for me is they generally have too little facts to fill an hour. Consequently, they tag some inane teaser over and over again to keep us viewing. There are no shortage of interesting facts about Pompeii, so keep them coming. They displayed the lifestyle of the time in a very interesting fashion. It made it easy to make parallels to our own culture. It is still better than most history courses, as they are not afraid of telling it like it is..or was in terms of the Roman way of life and how they viewed sex, definition of classes, and their economy. It was worth the effort to view, but could of conveyed the information in 30 min.",1361491200,4,678,4.432

4666549,3,B005ELVCPW,This short documentary has a lot of fluff.  The host doesn't really contribute all that much.  There are some interesting facts and some redeeming value to watching it but it wasn't all that great.,1351296000,,197,4.764705882352941
4666550,4,B005ELVCPW,"""Pompeii: Back from the Dead"" is a fascinating look at a unique find of human skeletons uncovered in a Pompeii cellar, likely some of last to perish in the Mount Vesuvius eruption in the summer of 79AD. Unlike most remains that were buried in ash and subjected to extreme heat, these were somewhat protected by being enclosed in the cellar. This documentary explains the events that lead up to Pompeii's final days, how the people likely reacted, and what anthropology archeologists can determine from the well preserved remains found at the site. There is also a good deal of speculation and discussion on the ""intimate"" habits of the residence of Pompeii as remembered by history and depicted in the surviving frescoes.

This will be worthwhile watching to anyone interested in Roman history!

4666551,4,B005ELVCPW,"Pompeii - Back From the Dead is a short documentary type show that goes over some possibilities and theories of the Pompeii tragedy. The excavation evidence is shown as well as reenactments to beef up their ideas about what happened.

I am interested in this huge volcanic eruption and found this show to be fairly entertaining and interesting, although, like others, I take it for face value. All anyone can do is make an educated guess.",1398729600,,438,4.7631578947368425

Many more details have been discovered in the ensuing years. I haven't been to up on it, so the surprise is. really a treat. I would recommend this as a must read for anyone  interested in history of that area. Earl Martin",1394668800,,340,4.573770491803279
4666553,2,B005ELVCPW,I stumbled upon this by accident and watched some of it. It was not realistic: much of the so-called facts are simply speculations and inferences that cannot be proved.  It would be better to call it a low budget movie then a documentary.,1394409600,,238,4.534883720930233
4666554,5,B005ELVCPW,"This was a very well made show, gave you some insight of what these people may have gone through also on how they lived. Would tell others this is a great one to watch to find out about what happened when the volcano erupted.",1393891200,,225,4.136363636363637

4666585,5,B005ELVCPW,A very descriptive documentary about a historical event almost beyond belief.

4666589,1,B005ELVCPW,"This video is lacking in solid evidence and details, and is definitely not appropriate for viewing in a classroom setting. There are several points in the video that discuss the sexual escapades of the residents of ancient Pompeii, and another segment talks about the discovery of urine and feces that was found by archaeologists. Really?? They couldn't find other topics to discuss in this video?? I bought this video to share with my 6th grade middle school students, and have had to put it on the shelf and keep it there. What a disappointment!!",1378252800,3,548,4.840425531914893

4666592,3,B005ELVCPW,"I started watching this video on Pompeii with my children hoping it would be educational, but very quickly had to turn it off because of the frequent references to sex.  It pervaded everything from commenting on a wife of the emperor living in Pompeii and hosting wild orgies in her pool to their teaser before a commercial break that skeletons would tell what people ate, how they lived, and their sexual habits... Companies use sex to sell us everything from clothing to cars - now history as well?  This may well be an interesting video for an adult audience, but don't count on it as an educational experience for children.  I'm sorry to see that the Discovery Channel feels it has to sink to this level to promote interest in its shows.",1375401600,3,741,4.598484848484849
4666593,5,B005ELVCPW,The story of Pompeii and Herculaneum continue as excavations continue. It is simply amazing what these sites are yielding regarding the events of August 79 A.D. If you love this history -- you will love this update.,1375142400,,215,4.837837837837838
4666594,4,B005ELVCPW,"It has been said that history not only brings the dead back to life but also assures that they continue to live through our memories.  This production certainly helps to lend validity to that statement.

We sometimes forget that there is really little difference between ourselves and the people who lived so many centuries ago.  And thanks to the discoveries examined in this show, we have learned even more about the eruption and subsequent destruction of two thriving towns and the people who resided there.  Especially upsetting is the way death overtook them. Even those who thought they were safe in the underground room had no way of knowing that nothing could save them.

I give it four stars because of the not-so-subtle pushing of a politically correct diversity agenda.  Enough already; it does grow old after a while.",1373328000,,829,4.928057553956834

i would recommend this.",1371081600,,186,5.166666666666667
4666606,3,B005ELVCPW,"If the set-up of this documentary had been a bit more straight forward, it would have engaged me more. The information is interesting and very well, if in painful detail, delivered.

However, it takes about fifteen minutes into the show before you realize that you're going to be examining recently discovered bones from Pompeii and why that is significant.",1369872000,,357,5.0508474576271185

8468557,1,B005ELVCPW,"The Discovery Channel is not in the business of education, but entertainment, which is why it repeatedly puts out programs like this that are not only short on facts, but often distort and misrepresent facts. Sometimes, they even stoop to making things up and presenting it to their unsuspecting audience as if it were, indeed, an established fact. Pompeii: Back from the Dead is a perfect case in point. Here are a few of the departures from reality featured in this ""documentary.""
1) The show's theme is the town of Pompeii; however the focus of the show is a group of skeletons found several miles away in a different town; Oplontis. There is no definite link between these skeletons and Pompeii, except that they died in the same volcanic eruption, but the show consistently refers to the bodies as being Pompeiian.
2) The show proclaims that one skeleton in the find is an ""African"" male. This is based on what??? Since it has been scientifically established that race cannot be determined from bones, how did they reach this startling conclusion?? Was there DNA found?
No---a little research reveals that one Italian anthropologist pronounced the skeleton to be African based on the shape of the skull---a practice long since debunked, and a conclusion discredited by the archaeological community: in short, everybody in the field has rejected this anthropologist's sensationalistic claims. The show never discusses any of this--it takes the false identification and runs with it.
3) The earthquake--and resulting claims of the show; The show presents the possibility that a major earthquake rattled the region of Pompeii a week before the eruption. More than likely true, given the typical geological activity leading up to a large volcanic event. However, the show postulates that this led to an evacuation of the local population a full week before the eruption. There's no such evidence. In fact, when a major earthquake rattled the region 17 years previous, in 62 AD, no such evacuation took place. People don't generally abandon their property and livelihoods following an earthquake. They pick up the pieces and get back to work. This whole line of reasoning is just put forth to support the show's premise---that the skeletons found at Oplontis were evacuees from Pompeii. Again zero evidence.
4) A gladiatorial show taking place at the time of the eruption; the show specifically claims that an ""ancient Roman source"" records said event. This is a blatant falsehood. The ""source"" is the Victorian author of the melodramatic novel ""The Last Days of Pompeii,"" in the 1800s. There is no such Roman account as the documentary claims.
There are plenty more misrepresentations, exaggerations, etc., but I've listed some of the more egregious ones that irked me.  I'm afraid you're not going to learn much from this show other than a lot of conjecture.
5) Herculeaneum: The show states that the nearby town of Herculeaneum was destroyed, like Pompeii, by the same pyroclastic flow. If you've done any study of this period and event, than you already know that this is not the case. Herculeaneum was destroyed by a volcanic mudslide of super-heated mud, which is somewhat different than the pyroclasim that obliterated Pompeii. This in itself may not seem that important, but it is representative of the sheer sloppiness and disregard for facts of this documentary. Obvious it was not intended for a knowledgeable audience, but I just can't stomach the idea that misinforming an uneducated audience is the way to go with a show that, at least, claims it is informative. In short, the only thing you will really learn from this show is a host of speculations and falsehoods.",1401408000,10,3680,5.042692939244663
