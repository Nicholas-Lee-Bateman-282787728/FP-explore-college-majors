7493,1,0767805534,"I first saw this film when it was released in 1969 and thought the critics of the day had gone collectively mad. Everyone in the entire film, whether it's ""heroes"" Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper or their antagonists,  are annoying. Jack Nicholson is the only one that attempts to create a  character out of his role. There is no story and theneverending vignettes  are pointless and/or pretentious. The script, if there was one, consists of  Dennis Hopper saying ""man"" every fifteen seconds. This film was  dated when it was released. Today, it's laughable.",913593600,22,556,4.935483870967742

7521,5,0767805534,"I was a young person in 1968 in America and one can't know what those times were like unless they were there. This was the period when Robert Kennedy, Martin Luther King were assassinated, the killings at Kent State, the Viet Nam War, and the outbreak of a nationwide counter-culture that created a divide between young people and the older generation. Mix that with weed and some of the best music ever made which was broadcast on our AM radios, sort of like forest tom-toms, to all young people. Revolution was in the air, and I don't mean theoretical revolution, or evolution. Things were that tense and earth-shattering in the country.

Along comes this film, which seemed to speak directly to us. The only film that did in those days. Because made by young people, not by tired old Hollywood directors out of touch with our generation.

This film's language of visuals has been borrowed by generations of later filmmakers. The stuttering cut, the road movie, the biker film and more. Scorsese used the wall-to-wall music soundtrack for ""Mean Streets"", which made his reputation. Francis Ford Coppola used the stuttering cut in ""The Godfather"". Easy Riders message is in Wyatt's single sentence, ""We blew it"". The film accurately predicted that the counter-culter would fail because of an over-fixation of drug taking. The two protagonists do a drug deal to make a big pile and go on a trip across the country on choppers.

Wyatt, played by Peter Fonda (his father had played Wyatt Earp) and Billy (think Billy the Kid) are the two faces of the counter-culture. Wyatt, soft-spoken, smart, thoughtful; Billy, played by Dennis Hopper, is in your face, out front emotional and inclined to look out only for his own interests. And a third minor character, played by Jack Nicholson (this film made his career).

The Amazon description of the film begins, ""Two hippy bikers.."" made me laugh out loud. There's no such thing as a ""hippy bikers"" and even if there were, Wyatt and Billy are not ""hippies"". They're not really even bikers, they're just fulfilling a dream to go across country on bikes. The film is layered with many meanings and is not a simplistic ""biker film"" nor just a ""road movie"" or adventure flick. It's a well-thought-out film, with some great images and scenes, and some of the best music ever, including songs by Bob Dylan, the Byrds, Jimi Hendrix, Steppenwolf and The Band.",1516492800,,2393,4.843520782396088

Can we all least agree that if you took the section of the movie where they played The Band's ""The Weight"" it would make one kickass 5 minute music video? That is the only part of the movie that I try to catch when I see it playing on tv.

Otherwise, even though I find the movie to have some redeeming qualities (at least it documented the aimlessness of the hippie/commune generation and the attitude of the mainstream toward them at that time) I agree that the plot is pointless (mirroring the aimlessness?).

Did anyone else recognize one of the commune leaders from Star Trek (TOS)? I believe he played a troubled teen named Charlie that had been raised by aliens that taught him the ability to use his mind to control humans. When the Enterprise picks him up to take him back to humans he has trouble adjusting and uses his powers negatively.",1493337600,,900,4.448484848484848

This film isn't what I expected. Initially, it begins on a happy note by showing Peter Fonda and Dennis Hooper traveling across America on their motorcycles. There's a feeling of euphoria and freedom as we see beautiful landscapes and people waving to them. They pick up travelers along the way, visit a commune, swim in lakes, camp, and smoke pot. Ahhh, what a life of adventure.

However, events take a darker turn through intolerance. They just aren't welcome because they have long hair and are unshaven. Jack Nicholson, who plays an alcoholic civil rights lawyer, observes that it's fear and, maybe, jealousy of their free lifestyle. Nicholson gives a good performance and isn't the caricature that he later became. Eventually, the two bikers experience a bad acid trip and, finally, a senseless shooting.

I enjoyed Peter Fonda's performance. He conveys a lot of compassion with only a few lines here and there.

The story is on the thin side with nice 60's music.",1491177600,,986,4.957575757575758

7903,1,0767805534,"My whole life (I'm over 50) I've read about how great this movie was supposed to be. I never really thought about it till after I watched this but not once in my lifetime had I ever actually heard somebody I know say they liked this movie. Now I know why.

I already know what all the fans of the movie would say to me. How they don't even want to waste their breath on somebody as ignorant as me or I had to be alive during the times. Well that argument isn't going to hold any water with me. I admit my favorite genre is science fiction but one of my favorite genre's is also drive-in movies of the 50's, 60's and 70's to which this movie belongs along with many Roger Corman movies.  I don't know how much I can say that hasn't already been said both by lovers of the movie and critics. I don't know what the movie critics were thinking. There is no way that today a movie like this would garner positive reviews. Not with the internet being what it is. I suppose many movie critics of the time were part of the hippie generation and were liberal minded. Even so, I don't know how you can possibly think this was a good movie.

After the first 5 minutes it was all downhill from there. There is nothing exceptional about this movie. I've seen much better biker movies or better movies of any genre you want to classify this as. The direction is poor. There is a reason nobody would give Dennis Hopper a job for a long time after this. His next movie was a bomb and I think Hollywood realized he just go lucky with the reviews. The editing is poor also. There are several inconsisticies. The acting is well below average also. Not to mention the 'locals' they used didn't help matters. While I was watching it I said to myself ""I'll bet they just used local people, these people can't act"" and sure enough I learned that's exactly what they did. It ends terribly and I learned nothing other than the hippie movement was a waste of time. There is nothing in this movie that stands the test of time. It appears to be a movie about a bunch of losers who did nothing with their lives. I don't want to make this sound like a political discussion but what good is all this 'freedom' they talk about so for you if you do nothing with it other than to live like an animal. Then again I don't spend my life smoking weed either so I guess I'll never understand.

The movie is boring, poorly acted, poorly directed, poorly edited, plot starts OK and slowly goes nowhere. In a way it reminded me of 'The Incredible Shrinking Man.' Eventually the main protagonist shrinks to nothingness. Same as this movie.

Unless they find all that lost footage and make this into a better movie, I will never watch it again and consider it a lesson learned. I have no idea what the AFI was thinking when they included this in their 100 greatest movies.

This opinion is not coming from the younger generation who just want to see action. I actually like slow movies, independent movies....low budget movies in particular. But this one is just ridiculous. I'll admit that movies sometimes seem worse when you have expectations (opposite is true too) but this one is just flat out ridiculously boring and it teaches you nothing despite it's pretentiousness. Just look at Dennis Hopper. Typical from the generation and he is just a burn out. Listen to the commentary on the additional making of feature. They talk about him ranting and raving about the government and how they knew what they were doing when making the movie. He sounds like a raving idiot.

The only good thing that came out of this was that Jack Nicholson got himself recognized. The only decent actor in the movie.

I couldn't be more disappointed when watching a movie.

Recommended for people who just have to see every movie on AFI's 100 greatest films. There is no other reason to watch this other than to use this movie as an example of the saying, ""opinion's are like ........ everybody has one.""",1462579200,3,3944,4.428965517241379

7915,5,0767805534,"Easy Rider is a movie that captured the counterculture atmosphere of the 1960s. Produced during the decline of the studio system, Easy Rider, directed by Dennis Hopper, was made on a small budget and is today regarded as a cinematic milestone, ushering in the New Hollywood movement.

Bikers Wyatt/Captain America (Peter Fonda) and Billy (Dennis Hopper), with money in their pockets from smuggling cocaine across the border, head from Los Angeles to New Orleans to celebrate Mardi Gras. En route, they are temporarily sidetracked by a commune of free spirits and later arrested for parading without a permit. In jail, they meet drunken lawyer George Hanson (Jack Nicholson), who agrees to join them on their road trip.

The movie is constructed episodically. One scene takes place at a roadside cafe where the trio is denied service. Another depicts a bad LSD trip in a cemetery, and yet another has the three guys smoking pot around a campfire and revealing more of their backgrounds. Though Wyatt and Billy are drug dealers hoping to live a life unanswerable to the establishment, they are portrayed as attractive characters bucking the system and  for a time  getting away with it.

Easy Rider didn't look or sound like any movie made in America up to that point. It was clearly groundbreaking for the film industry, but also had a dramatic effect on society in general, with baby boomers coming of age questioning the values, rules, and policies of the older generation. The movie is still powerful and still resonates as a commentary on a divided America and generational conflict.

Bonus features on the Blu-ray Special Edition include two audio commentaries with Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda, two documentaries about the making and history of the film, TV excerpts showing Hopper and Fonda at the Cannes Film Festival, and theatrical trailers.",1462233600,,1851,5.052459016393443

Though some scenes show their age in terms of dialogue and situation, on the whole the film captures the essence of that generation's belief in hope and potential for America that is so gutted in the harrowing final minutes. Such a prescient vision of the divisive decade on the horizon. Well worth the watching for those wanting simply a well-filmed road movie, but so rewarding for those looking deeper (like the horse-shoeing scene early on--a clear example of Hopper's recognition of America's shifting self-view).

These and others capture the spirit of the times that they were made.
  And Easy Rider EASILY captures what the 60's counter culture was & should have been about: Getting back to basics, Loving yourself, Loving your neighbors, being at one with your surroundings, etc.  So if one wants to see what the 1960's counter culture was like, than Easy Rider is the movie to see",1432080000,,696,4.655737704918033

8166,5,0767805534,"This is well worth the (minor) investment to have a copy of one of the seminal works of American cinema.  Born of naivete, made on an almost-impossibly short budget, filmed in actual locations and making use of pop-music stars as actors, actors as directors, directors as stuntmen, and real locals as (reluctant) actors, this may be the ultimate in independently-minded filmmaking.

When I first saw bits of this on American TV in the 1970s, I dismissed it as a story about dope addicts.  That was a very shortsighted (and inaccurate assessment.  Seeing it now I recognise a very profound story about two almost-lost souls searching for something uplifting and good about America during the Vietnam-war draft era.  Pay close attention to how Fonda admonishes Hopper for criticising the commune's food-- this is a guy with heart and compassion.  By the time they get to Mardi Gras, all he wants is to be cradled in the arms of his (long-gone) mother, a woman or just Jesus-- the LSD trip in the graveyard echoes with the Catholic rites and catechism reminding him that, for all his fruitless searching, he can never truly go home.

The new 'special edition' includes 'making-of' footages and interviews that really enlighten the viewer as to how and why this was made.  The best part of that is learning that the Louisiana rednecks and girls in the diner were actually locals, pressed into service as actors.  Hopper asked them if they could play the parts of local people who hate hippies-- no difficult task.  Imagine how the actors and crew felt in putting a real shotgun into the hands of these guys later!

Spoiler: the two motorcycles used for the principal characters were actually four: two were put into storage after the film and were subsequently stolen and two were left right where they ended up at the end of the film, being essentially junk by then.  No-one has EVER been able to credibly claim that they have a Harley that was *actually* used in the making of 'Easy Rider'.",1431216000,,1988,4.780701754385965

8268,5,0767805534,"""Easy Rider"" does more for movies than any other when it comes to dealing with the conclusion of the 1960's, one of the most turbulent tmes in American history. People wanted to live ""free"" lives and be their own self after the killings of President Kennedy, Martin Luther King and so many other prominent figures in U.S. society. Men and women wanted to be free spirits to find their own way in life which meant doing drugs, having sex when they wanted and basically being themselves.

 ""Easy Rider"" is one of the best buddy films in American cinema. In this case it deals with two bikers, Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper, who drive across the American South West to discover a better life. The film is well acted, well written and is extremely beautiful on Blu Ray as the studi did an amazing job with the transfer.

 Jack Nicholson has a small part in the film and the small amount of screen time he has in ""Easy Rider"" shows audiences the kind of actor who would become.

 The film was nominated for three well deserved Oscars.",1421971200,,1029,4.505376344086022

It's essentially a taste of the 1960s American counter-culture, glimpsed from the back of Fonda's motorcycle as it powers through the desert. His character is a guy in search of himself, much like that generation. He and Hopper's cross-country drive doubles as a spiritual awakening kind of experience. Experimentation with drugs, commune life, and the hippie ""free loving"" vibes are the cornerstones of this film. The American flag on Wyatt (Fonda)'s helmet and bike, as well as the familiar backdrop of the American Southwest, gives the whole movie an earthy, grassroots, Americana feeling. Not a lot of drive to the movie, as the main characters are kind of in personal limbo (rebels without a cause), but that's really the point. And can't we all relate?",1419811200,2,876,5.090277777777778
8298,5,0767805534,"Easy Rider is a road movie that tells the story of two bikers who travel through the American Southwest and South with the aim of achieving freedom. It represents the era of counterculture during its year of release. It stars Peter Fonda,Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson.

Tossing wristwatches away, two bikers hit the road to find America. After a major cocaine sale to an L.A. connection,free-wheeling potheads Billy,played by Hopper; and Wyatt aka Captain America,played by Peter Fonda,head eastward to party at Mardi Gras before going to Florida with the riches concealed in Wyatt's stars-and-stripes gas tank. As they ride through the Southwest, they take a hitchhiker to a struggling hippie commune before they get thrown in a small-town jail for ""parading without a permit."" Their cell mate,drunken ACLU lawyer George Hanson, does them a favor by getting them out of jail and then decides to join them. Babbling about Venusians, George discovers the joys of smoking grass, but an encounter with Southern rednecks soon proves how right he is about the danger posed by Billy's and Wyatt's unfettered life in a country that has lost its ideals. With the straight world closing in, Wyatt and Billy try to revel in New Orleans with some LSD and hookers but the acid trip is shot through with morbidity. Once they reach Florida, Billy raves about attaining the American dream; Wyatt, however, knows the truth: ""We blew it."" He knew that their financial success resulted in a spiritual failure.

Easy Rider represents the feeling of its time about counterculture and the anti-establishment movement. It also reflects the emotions and spirit of its time. I must say that this movie represents what sex,drugs and rock and roll is all about. Great performances were turned in by Fonda,Hopper and Nicholson. Overall,the film is about the times of the Vietnam War era and the spirit of its times.",1419638400,,1891,5.038338658146965

8337,4,0767805534,"Too bad Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper never released their 3 1/2 hour original cut of Easy Rider. I guess what nowadays would be called the ""Director's Cut"", or the ""Extended Edition"". Peter Fonda showed this cut to his father, Henry, who liked it, and talked of releasing it after the theatrical version had played out. Back then, that would have meant a theatrical release, in the days before VHS cassettes and DVD's. On the music: CSN&Y's ""Find The Cost of Freedom"", performed acappella on their live album ""Four Way Street"" was originally written by Stephen Stills for the ending of the movie, but Fonda/Hopper instead used ""Flow River Flow"", written by Roger (nee Jim) McGuinn, and performed by the latest incarnation of The Byrds at the time (1969).

Rip Torn was originally cast for the part subsequently played by Jack Nicholson. However, Dennis Hopper got into a huge argument with Rip Torn, and pulled a knife on him (most likely a Buck Folding Hunter). Torn, having been an MP in the Army, quickly ""subdued"" Hopper, and left the production. Opening the door for Jack Nicholson, who Peter Fonda had worked with when acting in some Roger Corman films (such as The Trip, which I'm sure is available from Amazon). And the rest, as they say, for Jack Nicholson's career, is history.

After the incredible success of Easy RiderThe Wild Angels, starring Peter Fonda, The Glory Stompers, starring Dennis Hopper, and Hell's Angels on Wheels, starring Jack Nicholson, were packaged and re-released on a triple bill. I'm sure all of those movies are available from Amazon as well.

PS: Maybe all this Easy Rider history is in that booklet accompanying the Duluxe Edition. I do not know, as I've never seen that booklet.",1413763200,2,1719,4.860068259385666

Now, decades later, I see much more in the film than I did back then.  The social issues.  Rebellion.  Drugs.  Freedom & travel.  Conformity & captivity. Love.  Hate.  Peace.  Violence.  The stars of the show remain the motorcycles (which  in this case, also served as vehicles of rebellion, escape, and non-conformity).

The Easy Rider bikes were super cool.  Peter Fonda in Easy Rider remains super cool.  And the film still captures my imagination.  It, along with Marlon Brando's ""The Wild One"", were foundational in driving my love affair with motorcycles over the years.

The movie shows the different experiences life was being viewed by different generations at that time. The open carefree attitudes of youth versus the cautiousness of older generations and socially closed mindedness of others.

The motorcycle carried Jack Nicholson, but he carried the movie. Easy Rider is about Captain American penetrating the darkness that was the south and the racism of the time. Fonda and Hopper created a theme, but the quality acting was Nicholson. It is a movie in context and has to be understood as a response to the Vietnam war and the injustice of our time in history.

8528,2,0767805534,"The movie is the embodiment of the existentialism philosophy.  [Spoiler Alert]  The road trip [life] has no larger meaning except as an avenue to explore one hedonistic experience after another.  There is no higher purpose and the two protagonists eventually end up dead on the side of the road.  The interesting part of the film is that it tried to portray the counterculture movement as the heirs to the traditional American life.  Wyatt and Billy are modern cowboys.  The hippie communes are the heirs of the traditional farmers and ranchers.  The sentiment is given voice by George Hanson [Jack Nicholson]:  ""You know, this used to be a helluva good country.  I can't understand what's gone wrong with it.""

Easy Rider also attempts to redefine the traditional American definition of ""freedom.""  In the same monolog previously mentioned, George Hanson explains that Wyatt and Billy make people nervous because they represent true freedom.  He then defines freedom as the ability to do what you want, when you want, without any societal restraints.  The Founding Fathers of the United States defined freedom [liberty] as the ability to do what was right.  They defined the ability to do whatever you wanted without restraint as licentiousness and warned that it would eventually lead to the loss of freedom and liberty.  Easy Rider and the existentialist culture succeeded in altering the concept of American liberty and freedom away from what the Founders envisioned.

Overall, the movie is a good representation of the existentialist life.  Otherwise, it is a boring and meandering journey with only a few highlights.  I am glad I watched it but it is not going to be a personal favorite.",1385596800,2,1693,5.050541516245487

But every time the urge comes to do just that I remember an interview with Peter Fonda where he said the key to the movie (my words probably) was a scene near the end when they're kicking back having accomplished all they set out to do & sitting on the precipice of the future; thinking back on the adventure, Captain America couldn't help but think he missed something;  'we f*@!ed up', he said to Billy his faithful companion, shortly before they rode off into the sunset.

Fonda said it was something like they should have stopped to live with some of the people they met along the way because they were really the ones who were living.  Kind of like the end of East Bound & Down.

But I didn't like it much then, and I feel about the same now. However, I did like the scenes of the American southwest as it is my favorite place to vacation. But the central theme of the movie: freedom? Uh, no thanks. Living that kind of life is just as deadening as any traditional way of life you can think of. Constantly getting high and saying ""groovy man"" ? Sorry. And the two main characters, Wyatt and Billy, are actually criminal drug-smugglers. But of course to the geniuses at Rolling Stone and other leftist, counter-culture outlets, they were ""heroes"" who were thumbing their noses at  America and the man. The South really takes it on the chin with the climax of the movie and all the scenes in-between. Jack Nicholson's career was kick-started (ha, ha) by this flick, but his oft-quoted line about people hating Wyatt and Billy because they represented freedom is a crock. Most adults looked at hippies as drug-addled lunatics who were wasting their lives. Which they were. Another myth left over from the sixties is that most kids were hippies like the dolts in the commune. The fact is only a tiny percentage of kids (less than 5%) were hippies. So as an entertaining medium Easy Rider barely satisfies. It's interesting to me for reasons other than being a realistic movie. Which it isn't.

I suppose if we were living in that era it's avant-garde message would have stuck us and we would have cheered the performance.  Today, not having lived in that era, and spoiled by modern techno-cinema, I missed a lot, but I did see many comparisons and points that were trying to be exposed.  Compare them to today.

8581,4,0767805534,"The 1960s saw a lot of social change. The hippie movement, the increased exposure of recreational drugs, and the idea of freedom were all on the rise. Easy Rider captures that time and tries to depict a feeling. For the most part, it succeeds.

Wyatt (Peter Fonda) and Billy (Dennis Hopper) star as two bikers who are riding across America on their choppers. We see them buying and selling drugs, and meeting up with other like-minded people. They are determined to leave behind the established system and make their own way in life. In a way, this is a road movie, but it's also much more.

The biggest source of conflict in the movie comes in the form of people who see Wyatt and Billy as dangerous non-conformists. They are arrested on dubious grounds and receive verbal abuse from some of the townspeople they meet along the way.

The story itself is actually pretty thin. This is a movie that is more about the lifestyle than the plot of its characters. The idea of communes and free love are not as shocking as when they first appeared, but imagine watching the ideas portrayed in this movie when it was released.

Jack Nicholson shows up as lawyer George Hanson, who helps out our rebellious heroes when they find themselves locked up in jail. Nicholson's role is brief, but memorable. Hopper and Fonda do a great job of portraying the free-spirited bikers.

Music plays a big part in the movie and helps to establish the 60s feel. Be ready for Hendrix, Steppenwolf, The Byrds, The Band, Roger McGuinn, and many other performers from the era. The other star is the American scenery. The mountain locations are particularly spectacular.

The movie is dated now, but I found it enjoyable nonetheless. I would recommend it for people born in the 50s or before, as well as younger people who are curious about what life might have been like at the end of the 60s.

The Blu-ray presentation from Criterion (in the America Lost and Found set) does a good job of restoring this important movie, and comes with commentaries and a choice of audio options.

For cinephiles, there's the rather radical use of sudden flash-forwards throughout the film--a technique that worked truly well and certainly showed a lot of us who were used to Hollywood linear film-think that you could play with time and space, exactly as our experiments with consciousness told us we could.

8717,1,0767805534,"The American Film Institute rated this movie #88 of the 100 best movies of all time.  While I tend to agree with the institute on their picks, I believe the Institute was likely stoned when they rated this film.  I understand the concept of the film: disillusioned anti-establishment pothead youths dropping out to find true freedom and true expression, but the filmatic means used to reach this end go absolutely nowhere.  The director, Dennis Hopper, (also a costar in this monument to the sixties), loads at least a third of the film with mostly meaningless, boring footage of the two cyclists touring through the American west using drug-culture inspired music from the 60's as the soundtrack. Honestly, I could have filmed better footage through my childhood super-8 camera. And with perhaps the exception of one or two songs (Born to Be Wild), the music is dreadfully dated, the lyrics incomprehensible, and incredibly boring.

It seems Peter Fonda's main role is to look cool, and he does this quite well, but he does little else in the entire film. His emotional range does not register on the Richter scale.  Dennis Hopper's character is one-dimensional as well - we know all about him in the first 15 minutes of the film.  Only Jack Nicholson's character lends any acting credence to the film.  Nicholson shines as the lawyer who seeks the freedom to throw off society's restraints, but even Nicholson cannot save this sinking ship.

There is a climatic scene at the end of the film when the duo reach New Orleans and celebrate Mardi Gras. They have a LSD drug trip and the camera tries to capture the ""trip"" experience.  Again, the sequence is poorly filmed, poorly edited, and is far too long.  The photographic special effects used are hopelessly antiquated and I am sure high school film students of today could surpass this effort.

As I compare this film to the great classics: Gone With the Wind, The Graduate, Citizen Kane, Rear Window, To Kill a Mockingbird, Easy Rider truly has no wheels to ride on.  It is not a film for the ages, on the contrary, it is a film for 1969, and it belongs buried in the failed American era that was the sixties.

8719,5,0767805534,"Dennis Hopper directed this early film about the hippies. It accurately shows what actually happened sometimes when you let your ""freak flag"" fly, in the words of Jimi Hendrix, out there in square America in 1968.

Two young guys (played by Hopper and Peter Fonda) score a big drug sale, so they head across the country with their cash, towards Florida, on motorcycles, but this is not a biker movie! It's about the hippie attitude, lifestyle, and its backlash.

Along the way they pick up their alcoholic hitchhiker (Jack Nicholson) who is murdered one night in an attack by country bumpkin locals as the guys were sleeping in the woods. The survivors proceed to New Orleans for Mardi gras as planned, and encounter two hookers (notably Karen Black for one), get mind blowingly high, where Hopper shows outstanding camera work and creativity in this masterpiece. Afterwards, moving on, the boys are fatally hasseled by a couple more rednecks, where the movie ends.

Easy Rider was filmed in many locations in the desert southwest and deep south, and the scenery almost steals the show. Many local folks were hand picked by Hopper to act in this film along the way. The sound track album was a big hit in 1969 as well.

As a special feature, Dennis Hopper's running commentary on the film brings special insight to one of the finest, most colorful period flicks ever made.",1359936000,3,1372,4.8008474576271185

8742,5,0767805534,"If you can't handle the counter culture movement of the late 60s and early 70s and all that went with it (hippies, drugs, free sex and communes) I suggest staying away from ""Easy Rider."" For everyone else, this is an excellent period piece from 1969 that explores the nature of freedom and the quest thereof.

Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper star as Wyatt and Billy, two hippies who travel by choppers from Los Angeles to New Orleans to attend the Mardi Gras. Along the way they experience gorgeous landscapes, a commune, jail, new friends, unexpected enemies, drugs galore and a whore house when they arrive.

Jack Nicholson stands out as one of the friends they meet; while the beautiful Karen black & Toni Basil star as two prostitutes in New Orleans.

What makes ""Easy Rider"" great is that it's more than just a road adventure with a modern Western garnish (i.e. cowboys on motorized ""horses""). The film has depth that separates it from the typical biker flicks of that era. It's really about freedom or the lack thereof. Wyatt and Billy certainly have some grasp of freedom - and they desperately pursue it - but they're ironically so shackled by their OWN carnal desires and growing addictions that the most they attain is a piece of it. Wyatt laments near the end of the film: ""We blew it; we really blew it"" as he realizes freedom has slipped through their fingers like water. Nicholson's character, George, has more of handle on what's going on, but he obviously has his own issues.

The hippies at the commune seem to have escaped society's shackles but to what end? There's a reason communes never really caught on in America, and the film shows why.

In an interview with Rolling Stone in the early 70s Fonda pointed out that Wyatt represented everybody who feels that freedom can be bought, that you can find freedom through other things, like riding motorcycles across the country or smoking pot. He confessed that ""Easy Rider"" is actually about the LACK of freedom in modern Western Civilization. Wyatt and Billy are not right, they're wrong. The only thing the writers (Fonda & Hopper) could do in the end was kill the characters. In a sense, committing self-destruction, which Fonda claimed America was doing. He said viewers often respond to the end by lamenting, ""Look at those terrible rednecks, they killed those two free souls, blah, blah, blah."" But ""Easy Rider,"" he pointed out, is a Southern term for a whore's man, not a pimp, but the dude who lives with her. He's got the easy ride. And that's what he claims happened to America - liberty's become a whore, and we're all taking the easy ride.

So what's the answer? The answer's there and it's pretty clear, but don't expect me to hand-feed it to you. Seek and you will find.

In any event, this might give you some food for thought the next time you catch the
film.

Some modern viewers with ADHD criticize the film as boring, but I find it strangely engrossing from beginning to end. The climax is equal parts sudden, powerful, shocking and unforgettable.

The film was shot in California, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah (Monument Valley) and Louisiana and runs 95 minutes.

8748,3,0767805534,"'Easy Rider' tells of two bikers (Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper) traveling through the Southwest and South set in the 1960s. Hippies and drug use are explored, as well as the general antagonism towards 'long-hairs.' Fonda dresses in a leather jacket with an American flag on the back, while Hopper wears Native American-style buckskin pants and shirts. Fonda is appreciative of others, while Hopper is often hostile and leery of outsiders. Money is provided from the sale of cocaine from Mexico in L.A.

The two are given some LSD after leaving a commune, and told to share it with 'the right people.' Jokingly riding within a small-town parade, the two are arrested and meet ACLU lawyer/local drunk Jack Nicholson who helps get them out of jail. Later the trio are beaten at night by locals; Nicholson is killed and the other two suffer minor injuries. The two then make it to Mardi Gras in New Orleans, and later Fonda realizes their 'freedom' isn't that rewarding.

The movie ends when two other rednecks spot them, decide to 'scare the hell out of them' with a shotgun, and end up killing both after Hopper gives the one the finger.

Overall, the dialogue is minimal, and the acting even worse - except for Nicholson. On the one hand, the movie was totally boring and centers around lifestyles I dislike. On the other hand, it does a fair job of depicting the counter-culture lifestyle. Regardless, Peter Fonda looks as much like a motorcyclist as I look like Mr. T.",1357862400,,1467,4.767716535433071

I ONLY PURCHASED THIS MOVIE BECAUSE I HAVR A HARLEY AND REMEMBERED THAT ONCE A GO THERE WAS THIS MOVIE AND I WANTED TO SEE IT AGAIN. FOR ME MOVIE HAS NO ARGUMENT.,1343174400,,288,3.8813559322033897
8759,5,0767805534,"What an interesting movie. Apparently Easy Rider gets its primary kudos, and placement on the AFI top 100 list at spot 88, for being a fully independent movie. It was one of the first to really make inroads in the high-power movie system. Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda pretty much made this movie on their own, funded it, and then filmed themselves riding motorcycles across the US.

The motorcycles are now iconic, although one has to wonder with their tiny gas tanks just how often the characters would have had to stop for gas on their cross-country trip through some fairly empty wastelands.

Much of the movie is full of the gorgeous scenery of the United States. Having driven many of these roads myself, I found myself remembering those trips fondly while watching the movie, and wishing I could go back and take those trips again. The beauty of Monument Valley and other locations is brought vividly to life. In many ways it's a celebration of the wild range of landscapes.

There are also a variety of cultures shown here, which is equally interesting. Yes, we get the hippie commune of ""city-folk"" men and women trying their best to live off the dry, dusty land. We see small-town deep south, where the teen girls are intrigued by the strangers and the men-folk are threatened. There are the prostitutes of New Orleans, the quiet farmer and his family, and more. Everyone has their own view on life and what it means to live.

This is definitely a ""guy's film"". Nearly all women who appear are nameless and are there to ogle or idolize the men. The only two women who seem to talk more than a word are two are the two prostitutes in New Orleans, who go on a long acid trip with the guys. Most of their ""talk"", though, is wild ramblings due to the drugs.

Some say that this is a 60s ode to the glory of drugs. I don't see that. If anything, it seems to show that their path of freedom didn't lead to joy. One of the characters sighs, near the end, that ""we blew it."" He praised the farmer who had a wife, a family, and a quiet homestead where he was able to live off the grid. That is praised as being of value. The commune is poked at for being unrealistic - they plant seed into dry sand. The LSD trip, far from being shown as fun and color-filled, is shown as scary and dangerous.

A great movie to see at least once, since there are so many other movies, TV shows, and novels that reference scenes in this and expect watchers to be familiar with what is going on. It's also a powerful glimpse into time, to see the forces that were at work in the US in the late 60s.",1338768000,4,2580,4.364583333333333

Their names were supposedly based on Billy the Kid and Wyatt Earp of Wild West fame. Their adventures take them from farming families to hippie communes, from rural southern towns to their final destination:  Mardi Gras New Orleans. Watch for Jack Nicholson in one of his earliest and most unforgettable performances as George: the boozing, small-town lawyer.  The movie explores the drug counterculture and social intolerance of the late 1960's. The film editing is at times odd but other times, brilliant....which best describes co-writer/director Dennis Hopper's personality.
I saw this on the big screen when I was fourteen.  It marked the beginning of my love for motorcycles (and hippies). Wyatt (Fonda) rides on perhaps the most iconic motorcycle in history: The ""Captain America"" Chopper (a heavily customized Harley-Davidson). The movie has an excellent 60's music soundtrack played alongside beautiful Americana landscapes: it is a biker's dream trip. The pot smoking scenes are perhaps too frequent and sometimes ludicrous. There is also a strange but interesting ""LSD"" scene which attempts to show the psychotic side of a ""trip"".  Dennis Hopper went on to have a fairly successful film career and succumbed to cancer in 2010.  Peter Fonda (Jane's brother and Henry's son) is still working and gave an Oscar nominated performance in 1997's ""Ulee's Gold"".

8790,3,0767805534,"I remember being blown away by this movie when it first came out in 1969. Just the bikers in the final scene, especially, left me breathless. I remember leaving the theater feeling depressed because the conflict between the hippy bikers and the rednecks who finally shoot them dead seemed so emblematic of the bigger divide in society then between the straights and the hippies. Of course, I was only 16 then. What did I know? Today, this film plays a little differently. You have to look at it in its own context. Yes, the dialogue is ridiculous. And there is really no plot, to speak of. The soundtrack, which was very cool and original in its day, has, of course, been superceeded many times over by newer films that make more sophisticated use of music. The New Orleans cemetery scene is the weakest section. It was shot out of context from the rest of the film, and was something done first as a way for the filmmakers to try to get some money to make this movie. Dennis Hopper was a Hollywood pariah at the time. No one wanted to work with him because of his crazed drugging and drinking. Jack Nicholson was largely unknown, then a star of many obscure B-movies. Peter Fonda was the big man then, ironic because today he is the most forgotten of the three, never having made much in the way of other hit movies.

8807,5,0767805534,"Dennis Hopper's recent passing was the final straw in a decades-old interest in seeing this film. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was blown away by this film. We all know the story - a couple of hippie bikers ride out on a west-to-east cross-country tour to retire in Florida after a lucrative drug deal. Along the way, they run into about every permutation of hippie life in the 1960s - commune livers, idealist back-to-earthers, heavy druggers, free-lovers and the like. And they also run into a not-so-nice slice of ""regular"" America as well. Racists, hippy-haters, long-hair loathers, corrupt cops, prostitutes and swamp dwellers round out what passes for normal in the movie's vision of America.

What amazed me about the film is that it worked as an insightful allegory of the path of the hippy movement - while the hippy movement was in full swing. The film was shot in early 1968 - before the assassinations of MLK and Bobby, the Chicago riots and the election of Richard Nixon had soured the counterculture. So it was wild to see the film suggest the fatuity of the movement, its self-contradictions (back to Nature + smoke/drink/pill-pop your brains out) and its eventual rejection by society at large.

Great performances by the stars. Peter Fonda was the suave and  mellow side of the youth culture. Decked in a leather jacket emblazoned with an American flag, he was the nave intellectual, trying everything and finding everything to be interesting and acceptable. Dennis Hopper was the movement's unthinking, manic side - just looking for the next high, the next lay, the next thrill. Jack Nicholson was the film's tragic, realistic voice. With one world in the straight world and one in the wild world of Fonda and Hopper, he was able to see dangers that the other two were oblivious to.

The 35th anniversary edition is one of the very few movies whose ""making of"" segments were worth watching. Using interviews with Fonda, Hopper and others, it tells the story of the disarray of filming the movie and the struggle to get it on screen. Hopper's original cut came in at a mind-bending 3-1/2 hours long. Luckily, wiser hands wrested editorial control from him and gave us the masterpiece we have now.

8832,4,0767805534,"In the recent Associated Press obituary for the late actor and director, Dennis Hooper, is quoted as believing that, for him, the 1969 counter-cultural classic motorcycle film that he directed, ""Easy Rider"", was more a statement about the political landscape of the times than a male-bonding biker ""road"" movie. I agree with him, or at least that is how I have always viewed the film. The subjects of drugs, using and selling, dressing for ""hippie' success, the hard road of rural communal living (or urban communal living, for that matter), and trying to cope with the ""squares"" and ""rednecks"" were all in a day's work back in the days for those of us committed to ""seeking a newer world."".

In that sense ""Easy Rider"" is a very, very different road trip from that of the literary one in Jack Kerouac's 1957 ""On The Road"" (although the ""action"" of that book actually took place in the late 1940s). That small generational difference in time probably in cultural time was a matter of different epochs. The action of ""On The Road"" speaks to an almost subterranean escape from the bleakness of American conformity in the immediate post-World War II period behind the backs of the squares. The bikers, Fonda and Hopper (Wyatt and Billy, alright), in ""Easy Rider"" are up front and public, as reflected the change in mores of their times, about their ""making and doing"" as they confronted their version of American conformity in the 1960s. In the end they lost that public battle, and we have been fighting a rearguard series of ""culture wars"" battles ever since. But watch this film to get a slice of 1960s Americana. And if you are too young to know some of the references just ask mother and father (or the grandparents, ouch!). They WILL know.

Note: The late Doctor Gonzo"", journalist Hunter Thompson, rather eloquently in HIS countercultural classic, ""Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas"", mentioned toward the end of that fearsome saga that sometime in the late 1960s he could almost see the high tide of the movement ebbing before his eyes signaling the end of all those fierce dreams that we had of that ""newer world"" and the beginning of the approach of the ""night of the long knives."" ""Easy Rider"" is the cinematic take on that proposition",1275350400,4,2240,4.770618556701031

The problem I have with `Easy Rider' is that it doesn't go anywhere for nearly half the film.  I usually adore this freelance style of filmmaking, but `Easy Rider' does not sit well with me at all.  In fact, the film is one gigantic fail for me until Jack Nicholson enters the story.  His performance is outstanding, but I'll get to that in a minute.  The film seems to just hang there, serving as a longwinded music video for some great classic rock tunes and some stunning (yet unrefined) cinematography.  The `profound' statement that this film is trying to make gets lost along the way, only unveiling itself in small doses (like when Nicholson gets preachy in a sleeping bag).

`Easy Rider' is sort of boring.

Dennis Hooper's direction can be distracting at times (the way he splices his scenes together is creative yet unnecessary) and the tonal shift of his film towards the end is rather questionable.  In fact, the whole Mardi gras sequence (that psychedelic cemetery trip scene) is staggeringly brilliant yet completely mind-numbing in that it is so out of place it becomes a deterrent to the film, not an aid.  The eventual ending, while wholly prolific and steeped in profound insight, is more of a head-scratcher than anything else.  I think that is my biggest complaint with the films second half (which is far better than the droned out first half).  It is entirely inconsistent and winds up lacking any cohesive feeling.

But, there is always Jack Nicholson.  His performance is one of the best supporting performances of all time.  It is slick with wit, intelligence, bravado and profound sentiment.  He ties together a lot of loose ends about the `meaning' here, without ever feeling out of place or forced.  His charisma is in tact and his humor is just what this film needed.  I won't demean him by using the phrase `comic relief', but I will say that he spices up a film in dire need of some `spice'.

Jack playing Jack to perfection.

In the end, I have to say that I am NOT impressed with this one.  I was really excited about seeing this, but halfway through I was aching to turn it off.  The only reason I watched it through to completion was the fact that I wanted to see what Nicholson did here, and I'm glad I witnessed that performance.  So, if you are a fan of Jack then see this, for it is one of his best turns (he should have won the Oscar for this), but the film as a whole is not only outdated but uninspired, clumsy and boring.

At the time, I was dealing with my application for Conscientious Objector status with the draft board.  I was also being hassled by the FBI as an outspoken critic of the Viet Nam war.

The movie poster of Fonda as Captain America with a flag-embossed jacket riding on a big bike with the caption ""A man went looking for American and couldn't find it anywhere"" resonated with me.

SPOILER ALERT: And at the end, when the redneck in the pickup with the bulging tumor shoots ""Billy"" and ""Wyatt (Fonda and Dennis Hopper)"" I was incensed.  I felt I was the victim! This was the same world I was in.  The same prejudice.  The same hate.  Reel life was real life. END SPOILER ALERT.

This film was the first big ""youth movie"" that perfectly targeted its already alienated audience.  It was a bulls-eye.  For me, it was a brave movie because I knew that the creative team of writer Terry Southern, director Dennis Hopper, actors Jack Nicholson and Peter Fonda truly believed what they put on the screen.  This movie empowered me.  I realized I was not alone in how I saw the world, the war and America.

As a film student, I was not just interested in film as propaganda, but also in how the film was shot.  I knew it was shot for cheap - less than $500K.  (Recently, I ran into Fonda and he told me the actual cost was $250,000!)  I liked ow the movie broke some cinematic rules, like the law of ""consistent screen direction"" by having the bikes go in all directions.  There was the innovative use of music I actually listened too.  Wow, the Electric Prunes!  How did they know?

I wondered if the dope they smoked on screen was real and I asked Fonda.  He smiled and said, ""Of course.""  I liked that.  I liked the stoned ""Freedom"" speech from Jack Nicholson.  I believed what Jack said.  Those were my words too!  This movie made Jack Nicholson a star, and with the perfect audience that identified with him from the start.

I still love the joyful, free, wide-angle moving shots of the bikes on the open road with Steppenwolf's ""Born to be Wild"" pulsating on the soundtrack.  ""Get your motor running...""  Oh yeah.

Watching the movie today with the hindsight of alleged maturity(?), I now see an amateurish film.  Indulgent and sloppy.  Silly in places.  But the core question of What Is America? rings truer than ever.

8840,5,0767805534,"In 1969, the film ""Easy Rider"" debuted with much fanfare in America.  Not only would the film receive distinction as an important film that depicted the late 60's in America but it would be the first Independent film to be created with a low budget (under $400,000) and made $19 million dollars in the box office.  And help install confidence for the film studios that a Independent films can be successful and also a film created on a low budget can be successful as well.  Not only that, the film would be groundbreaking in that it used contemporary rock music at that time by The Jimi Hendrix Experience, The Byrds, Steppenwolf and more.

""Easy Rider"" would star very good friends Dennis Hopper (""Colors"", ""The Last Movie"", ""Hoosiers"") and Peter Fonda (""The Last Movie"", ""South Beach"", ""3:10 to Yuma"") in which Hopper would direct and Fonda would produce.  The two also wrote the film along with Terry Southern (""Barbarella"", ""Casino Royale"", ""The Telephone"").

The film revolves around two bikers Wyatt (Fonda) and Billy (Hopper) who begin the movie by smuggling drugs from Mexico to Los Angeles and making a very good profit.  With the money, the two can do what they want and that is to go on a on a road trip on their Harley Davidson choppers and drive to New Orleans, Louisiana for Mardi Gras.

Wyatt hides the money in his motorcycle's gas tank and the two embark on a trip enjoying the scenery and the freedom of traveling America.  Throughout the trip, we see the two drive and see the scenery of the trees, mountains and the open road way with popular music at that time.

During their trip, they encounter a hitchhiker (Luke Askew, ""Manhunter"", ""The Quest"") who they pick up and drive to a hippie commune.  Then the two end up driving through a parade in which they don't have a permit and end up being put in jail.  This is where they meet ACLU lawyer George Hanson (Jack Nicholson, ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", ""Terms of Endearment"", ""As Good As It Gets"") and learn that he is a drunkard but has always wanted to go to Mardi Gras.

So, when the two are released, they head out to New Orleans but what they don't expect is that what may have seem like freedom so far, until they hit certain areas they learn that people's perception of them are different.  People with long hair or people wearing leather pants are being looked at as ""hippie queers"" and the prejudice runs deep in those parts of America.

""Easy Rider: 40th Anniversary"" was hailed by Time Magazine as ""one of the ten most important pictures of the decade"" and entered the Library of Congress National Registry in 1998 because the film showcases America during that volatile time back in the late 60's.

The independent film was also quite volatile behind-the-scenes as Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda who were close friends at the beginning of the film, because of the demands of the film, the two had a falling out.  The film featured a lot of fighting between the crew, there was a lot of drug use with not only the cast but also the crew.  In fact, some of the scenes used on the film, the talent were wasted on marijuana and some have said that it was remarkable how much the actors were able to work while high on drugs.

The famous choppers that the two drove, although there were four total, two for backup.  The person in charge of watching over the choppers, Tex Hall, had a robbery attempt at his home with a shotgun on him and his girlfriend and the motorcycles were stolen.

And as for the people in the small towns, Hopper used actual people not actors and thus what we are truly seeing in the film are real reactions by Southerners in Louisiana reacting to the men who had long hair (Hopper) and Fonda's black leather pants.  These were just a few things that happened behind-the-scenes of ""Easy Rider"".

Needless to say, ""Easy Rider"" is definitely a time capsule for that moment of time and not only do you get the film, you also get the ""Easy Rider: Shaking the Cage"" in which viewers get to learn from each cast and crew of how volatile things were while shooting the film and things that happened behind-the-scenes that will definitely surprise people.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Easy Rider"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1) for the first time.  For a film created back in 1968, the film looks absolutely great, not perfect but still great.  No blemishes and certain outdoor scenes look absolutely fantastic and for a film 40-years-old, I have to say that it looks better than many films that I have seen released back in the 1980's and 90's.  Grain is kept and for the most part, detail of the chopper's, Billy's clothing, Wyatt's sunglasses, you see that detail. There were some scenes, such as the visit to the commune where picture quality seems a little aged compared to the rest of the film but for the most part, this is the best looking version of ""Easy Rider"" to date.

As for audio, the film is presented in English, French and Portuguese Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  Also in Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital and the original English mono soundtrack.  For the most part, the film is front and center channel driven and during my first viewing, but that impressive soundtrack that this film is known for is nice and clear, dialogue is nice and clear and the revving of the motorcycles is nice and clear.  The film is dialogue and music driven and there is surround channel usage during the trippy drug-induced parts of the film when you hear voice all around you but also during that brief and tragic action sequence at the end of the film.  But the music...from hearing that bass guitar and percussion in union on ""If 6 was 9' from The Jimi Hendrix Experience to that electric guitar and well known vocals of Steppenwolf of ""Born to Be Wild"" with the men on their bikes, that's classic but to hear it on DolbyTrue HD is awesome!

Speaking of the film's soundtrack, ""Easy Rider"" was one of the first films to have an original score and feature popular contemporary rock songs at that time.  Included in the film are:

  * Steppenwolf - The Pusher
  * Steppenwolf - Born to Be Wild
  * The Byrds - Wasn't Born to Follow
  * The Band - The Weight
  * The Holy Modal Rounders - If You Want to Be a Bird
  * Fraternity of  Man - Don't Bogart Me
  * The Jimi Hendrix Experience - If 6 Was 9
  * Electric Prunes - Kyrie Eleison
  * The Electric Flag - Flash, Bam, Pow
  * Roger McGuinn - It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)
  * Roger McGuinn - Ballad of Easy Rider

As for subtitles, the subtitles are in English, English SDH, French, Portuguese and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES

""Easy Rider: 40th Anniversary"" receives Sony's special digibook packaging with a total of 36-pages and information on the music, the talent and an essay of the importance of the film and the beginning of New Hollywood.  As for special features, the following are included:

  * MovieIQ - Viewers can watch the film via BD-Live and get up-to-date details on the characters, behind-the-scene factoids, music and more.
  * Audio Commentary by Dennis Hopper - When it comes to ""Easy Rider"", as mentioned by the people who worked on the film, everyone has a story and in this case, we hear Dennis Hopper's commentary of the film.  For the most part its informative but Hopper tends to not speak for long stretches in time (I'm guessing he was engrossed in watching the film) and he's actually quite quiet.
  * Easy Rider, Shaking the Cage Documentary - (1:04:51) The crew and talent of ""Easy Rider"" give us a behind-the-scenes look at the creation of this film, how volatile things were and also dangerous.  An amazing documentary. Note: This documentary was featured in the DVD release and is featured in standard definition, English stereo and subtitles in Portuguese and Spanish.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Easy Rider: 40th Anniversary"" makes it's HD debut and for the most part, the result is making this Blu-ray release the definitive version to own with its impressive picture quality and for those who wanted to hear that awesome soundtrack in lossless audio, you have that option as well as the original theatrical mono version as well.

When I was watching the film, you can tell how special and how unique the film truly was.  It's one thing to have a motorcycle road film and showcasing the allure of someone that can be seen as an outlaw but in this film, it truly is a time capsule as we are watching something that captures America during that time.  From recreating the hippie commune of New Buffalo (in New Mexico) of many hippie men and women with kids all over the place to capturing that Southern feel towards hippies and men in leather (the guys weren't gay but because of they were outside of the norm of that area, they were considered offensive) and of course, the music, the motorcycles, the drug use.  That's the late 60's.

Also, some may view ""Easy Rider"" as a creative and artistic film as Hopper wanted to take advantage of creative editing styles but it would be interesting to see how his original 220 minute feature would be compared to the Henry Jaglom edited final 95 minute theatrical version.

""Easy Rider"" was also a first.  Being an independent film created less than $400,000 and making millions.  Jack Nicholson who was planning to quit from acting, was made a bonafide star thanks in part to this film and of course, ushering the new era of Hollywood and received the distinction of being in the American Film Institute's ""Top 100 Films of All Time"" (at #88) and Steppenwolf's ""Born to Be Wild"" at #29 for ""Top 100 Songs of All Time"".

And of course, the behind-the-scenes making of the film and knowing how drugged out the talent were during the filming and how some improvised scenes or scenes that were not in the script, ended up in the film is quite interesting.

If you have never owned ""Easy Rider"", this film deserves to be in your collection.  This is one of those rare films that manages to capture American culture at that time.  This film embodies the term ""sex, drugs and rock n' roll"" and once you are done with the film, ""Easy Rider: Shaking the Cage"", the documentary will definitely impress you.

If you are a cinema fan, ""Easy Rider: 40th Anniversary"" on Blu-ray is a film that deserves to be in your collection.  Even if you owned a previous version and not much is added in terms of special featuers content, the film is worth the double dip for that awesome HD presentation and it's rockin' lossless soundtrack.

When it came time to review this movie, I could not do it. That is, I could not do it without also reviewing it within the context of two other movies that I had just recently watched because all three of them have such a similar theme. In fact, they all have so many things in common that I decided to review all three of them at the same time as a medley, something I have never done before but which seems called for. If you'll follow me, you'll see what I'm getting at.

I was recently talking to a friend of mine at work when we happened to run into each other in the men's room. He asked me if I had ever seen the film EASY RIDER, and I answered that it was interesting and very synchronistic that he should ask me that because it was the last movie that I had just enjoyed watching at home on DVD. I said, ""Man, you know, I was JUST watching that last week! I LOVE that movie. I wanted to get the deluxe edition but I could not find it anywhere, so I just picked up the regular one at GIANT (the local supermarket) in the bargain bin for nine bucks."" My friend, Ian, then said, ""I only own three movies in my collection: EASY RIDER, THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES, and INTO THE WILD. Have you seen the other two?"" I answered that I had not and that I had always wanted to see the both of them, to which he quickly replied, ""You can borrow mine, man. I'll bring them in tomorrow for you."" ""Hey, thanks a lot, man,"" I replied with gratitude, and we both went back to work.

I watched both of those movies Ian let me borrow over the weekend of April 10, 11, 12, 2009 right on the heels of having watched EASY RIDER just weeks before. The amazing amount of similar themes running through all three of these films is impressive. All three of these movies express a preference for wandering and wonder over worrying and war for the characters involved. Each of them seems to express the plight of characters dealing with their own, personal rejection of the reality of petty worries and war (The Iliad), and choosing, instead, a life of venturing forth into the unknown world of wonder and wandering (The Odyssey). The characters in all three of these movies depict a great love of adventure and a great joy of being out on the open road. Jack Kerouac, author of ON THE ROAD, would have loved all three of these fantastic films, especially INTO THE WILD, as he was a great lover of the books of Jack London. Also, they all have a great, cinematic and panoramic, wide-angle viewpoint of the world. Watching these films gets one out of one's own head and puts one right into the world of the film. The scenery in all three films is stunning and absolutely breathtaking. The viewer is immediately projected ""into the wild"" world (if you will) of the characters. It's intense! You get taken along for a ride that goes not only far and wide out into the world but, also, deep into the hidden spaces of one's heart and mind. All three of these films will make you think about your own life in particular as well as the greater meaning of life in general. They are deep, psychological films that demand conscious labor of intellectual thought and emotional soul searching on the part of the viewer. You get taken for a ride, but it is definitely NOT ""easy!""

In my case, watching these films - especially INTO THE WILD - brought me back to a time when I myself, like the character in the movie, was 22 years old and questioning my place in life: what I wanted to be, what I wanted to do, where I wanted to live, how I wanted to live, and who I wanted to be with. I realize now that I was seeking a sense of place to fit in and a community to be a part of that I felt comfortable in more than merely trying to ""find myself."" But understanding that when you are going through it is another thing altogether. Watching INTO THE WILD hits home on all these points and more! I remember having just seen The Grateful Dead in concert in Hartford, Connecticut with my good buddy, Jimmy, in May of 1997, and feeling like I wanted to just bust loose of all of the constraints of society that seemed to be holding me back from my true calling - whatever that was. I was feeling like a wild animal caught in a trap, and I wanted to be free. I had dropped out of college almost two years before, and I had been working at two jobs back in my hometown of Lowell, Massachusetts. That summer, like the kid in INTO THE WILD, I planned to get away and I bought a bunch of camping equipment, quit my jobs, and hit the road. I first went up north to New York State to camp out with some members of the Neo-American Church in the region of Cranberry Lake. When I decided not to stay and started to trek back out to head off somewhere else, my glasses fell off of my head and into the muddy, swampy muck I had found myself in along the water's edge. It took me an hour to find them. I realized then and there that I was handicapped for this kind of wandering around with all this heavy weight on my shoulders. So, I hitchhiked back home, feeling just as lost and just as confused as ever. I continued to read hundreds of books to find an answer to my quest for authenticity and community, only to learn that I was just making the book stores richer. I tried yet again to break away that fall, and went back to western Massachusetts to see if I could find work out near my friends who were still going to school there. I could relate to the scene in INTO THE WILD where Christopher writes in his diary of all freedom seekers in the history of this country seeking it by going out ""west."" Whenever I would hear the lyrics to ""Stairway to Heaven"" by Led Zeppelin, when Robert Plants sings: ""There's a feeling I get when I look to the west and my spirit is crying for leaving,"" I would feel an urge inside me to head out west before I got too old to do it. Indeed, Christopher tries to inspire the old man who wanted to adopt him in the film (Hank Holbrook) to do the very same thing! After spending two weeks looking for work with no luck, and deciding not to move into a deserted cabin or tepee built out in the back woods of a local farmer's land because of the weather and being all alone, I left the generous hospitality of my good friend, Greg, and once more headed back home to find my way that way. Years later, after working an assortment of odd jobs over many years, I eventually ended up opening my own health food store in the summer of 1989 after deciding not to buy some land way up north in Maine or Vermont near the Canadian border - the only place I could afford land at the time. I concluded that if I bought the land, I would never be able to later do the health food store (one of the last business bastions left of hippiedom in corporate America), but if I opened the store and did not like it, I could always cash-in and then go off and buy some land somewhere out in the woods. I was always talking about ""moving to Alaska,"" to live in freedom and stuff like that - so I can really relate to what Christopher McCandless (the real character and promising young man of the true story of INTO THE WILD) was going through. I felt like I was looking at myself re-living my past. He took the path I almost took. I turned back. He never got the chance to. God only knows where he would be today if he had lived to tell his story!

I have a cousin who actually did the same thing once. He was even younger than me when he did it. My cousin, George, actually made it all the way to Alaska, and then Hawaii, and then Europe as well. He went all around the world. When he reached Alaska, he hooked up with some of his old friends from Dunstable, Massachusetts who had also moved up there to make money working on the pipeline and on fishing boats. He found work up there for a while, too, just like some of the characters in these three films. They worked along the way to help to make their journey. George ended up finding his friend, Jim Lavrakas, a famous photographer today for the Anchorage Daily News in Alaska. Ernesto and Alberto worked in a Leper Colony for a while in Peru. Christopher McCandless worked out in the fields cutting grain for a while to help pay his way. I have a good friend named Phil who actually did do what I had once intended on doing myself. He worked his butt off for years, saved a bunch of cash, and bought himself 25 acres of land up in Maine where he lives off the grid out in the woods as an independent, organic farmer and orchard grower. He says he did it to be able to live like a free man out on the land away from all of the social evils and urban ugliness of the city. He also wanted to be free and independent of his family, like Chris in INTO THE WILD. He did it. I guess I was too much of a homebody and a Hobbit to live alone all by myself out in the woods somewhere where no one knew me. It takes courage to live alone like Thoreau out in the wild. You need guts to do this kind of stuff. I know that one reason why I returned back home from my meager attempt at wandering through the woods was that I really missed music. I am a musician. There is no way to jam with other people and enjoy music and dance when you live alone out in the woods. It is impossible. Nevertheless, till this day, the TV series that ran in the early nineties about life up in a small town called Cicely, Alaska - NORTHERN EXPOSURE - is still my all-time, favorite television program. It had colorful characters. I guess some romantic ideas die hard.

It takes a lot of courage to leave the comforts of home and cut loose from all of your support system of family and friends and to just take off and hit the road to God knows where. It's a ""wild world,"" as Cat Stevens sings, and you've got to take care. All three films show the major characters getting into trouble out on the road. ""Alexander Supertramp"" (the vagabond name Christopher McCandless chose for himself after cutting up his social security card and all of his other documents of official identity before he hit the road) got the hell beaten out of him by railroad man one dark night when he was hobo-ing it out on a train. Both Ernesto and Alberto got chased out of town by a jealous husband and all of his hometown buddies after one of his friends saw the husband's wife flirting and dancing with Ernesto on the dance floor. In EASY RIDER, Peter Fonda's motorcycle gets a flat tire (the least of their troubles) just like Alberto's motorcycle kept on breaking down and eventually dying on them in THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES. These young characters in all of these films were not exactly experiencing the metaphysical revelations of Robert M. Pirsig in his masterful ZEN AND THE ART OF MOTORCYCLE MAINTENANCE - at least not at first - but they certainly all ran into a lot of trouble. The spiritual revelations began to come to them later, along the way. Indeed, all the major characters have major transformational experiences in one way or another as a result of their personal quests and traveling adventures. The road changes you. Also, there are many forks in the road, as Neil Young most recently informs us. It's hard to decide sometimes which way to go.

This changing of one's name seems to be a prerequisite to being a beat, road warrior out on the highway. Not only does Christopher change his name, but in EASY RIDER, the character played by Peter Fonda changes his name from Wyatt to ""Captain America,"" and the character played by Dennis Hopper begins to call himself ""Billy the Kid,"" both taking on the persona of Wild West characters of historical, American lore. In THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES, Ernesto begins to be called ""Fuser"" and ""Che"" (the name that stuck with him for the rest of his life!) while his buddy, Alberto, begins to be called ""Mial."" It's almost as if one has to shed one's former identity as a snake sheds its skin in order to take on one's true identity - and this requires the taking on of a new name, one which reflects one's true identity.

Another thing these movies have in common is the pairing of a more sensitive and reflective character with a more rough & tumble and more aggressive character. In the case of INTO THE WILD, the character - who is very sensitive and contemplative - is paired up against the people he meets on his journey along the way, many of which tend to be less graceful and sensitive as he is. In THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES, Ernesto is very much like the character that Peter Fonda portrays in EASY RIDER, and Alberto is, also, very much like the character that Dennis Hopper plays. The likeness is astounding. Ernesto, like Christopher McCandless in INTO THE WILD, is always writing in his journal and thinking about the deeper meaning of things. Peter Fonda, as well, is portrayed as the more thoughtful and contemplative one than the rambunctious and womanizing Dennis Hopper. One character is graceful and patient, full of compassion for other people, while the other is less refined and always in a hurry, and somewhat more selfish. They are like The Odd Couple - but riding on motorcycles!

Another theme that runs deeply through all three films is the powerful and destiny changing power of rivers! The awesome power of the natural world, exemplified by a river in all three films, is undeniable. You can't miss it. In the case of INTO THE WILD, it was the raging force of the rolling river rapids that prevented Chris from crossing back in the spring to the other side from which he came. It was too wide, too deep, and with waters gushing too fast to cross. He was forced to go back to the bus where he had been living all winter. It ultimately decided his destiny for him. He almost drowned in it on his attempt to cross it. In the end, it was because of the river which separated him from all that he cared about in his past that sealed his fate. The poison plants he mistakenly ingested while he was starving did not help, either. In the case of EASY RIDER, it was along the river that both characters met their fate, and got blown away by a couple of backwoods rednecks out for a spin in their pickup truck. Maybe it was their bad karma? Still, the injustice of the moment is profound, as one watches Peter Fonda's motorcycle go up in flames while Roger McGuinn of the Byrds sings Bob Dylan's song, ""The Ballad of Easy Rider,' as the lyrics ""flow, river flow"" repeat throughout the song like the flowing river itself. In the case of THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES, it was along the river where Ernesto found himself, in the sense of his true calling, while administering to a sick, leper woman who made him realize that there are other ways to heal people - and prevent them from getting sick in the first place - than by being a physician to individuals. Society itself can be in great need of a social healer. The river separated the sick lepers on one side from the hospital care workers on the other. Ernesto refused to wear the superstitious rubber gloves on his hands from the very first day. One night, on his birthday, he had a spiritual rebirth when he took a rite of passage and dove into the river, swimming all the way across to the other side where all of the sick lepers along the shore encouraged him on. On doing so, he once and for all proved to his friend, Alberto, that he was no wimp but a true man with determination and courage. He showed an inner strength that inspired all of those around him. How they cheered his victory over the river! He would not be stopped by anything. That came later, when he was ""Che Guevara"" the revolutionary in Bolivia, when the sneaky CIA killed him. His nobility still shines brightly! Like ""Alexander Supertramp"" in INTO THE WILD and ""Captain America"" in EASY RIDER, he had a huge heart and a great soul. He truly cared about people.

Another theme that runs through all three of these films is a sense of loneliness. The number on the bus that Christopher lived in depicted in INTO THE WILD is number 142. Numerologically, this adds up to a number 7 - the number of solitude and loneliness. In EASY RIDER, the character played by Peter Fonda ends up all alone in a New Orleans cemetery, perched atop a statue of the Virgin Mary while he's peaking on LSD in a death-rebirth acid trip-induced mystical experience, screaming out in tears to his real dead mother and asking her why she killed herself, leaving him all alone. In THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES, you find Ernesto feeling more and more isolated from his friend and feeling lonely after he receives the ""Dear John letter"" from his girlfriend who they had visited just weeks before. His sense of loss and isolation is profound. His shattered dream of a romantic relationship with this woman cleared the path to true enlightenment for him. The viewer can sense this profoundly at the end of the film when you see him saying goodbye to Alberto before getting alone onto the aeroplane waiting to take him away toward his ultimate destiny. All three of these characters experienced major spiritual transformations along their journey out on the road of life far away from home.

One last characteristic that all the major characters in these three films have in common is their persistent, uncompromising, diligently determined drive to all reach their goals - for good or ill. They are all absolutely hell-bent on following their dreams and dancing to the beat of their own drummer. They all choose freedom over security. Ironically, they all consciously choose the path of Odysseus - of wandering - but they all end up reaching the same end as Achilles - of dying young in a flame of glory. That's fate. The ancient Greeks called her ""Moira."" Even the Gods themselves are at her mercy. In EASY RIDER, Billy was always pushing his more contemplative partner onward toward their goal of reaching the famous whorehouse in New Orleans. It almost seems as if the only reason why ""Captain America"" wanted to also go was to pay his respects to their long lost companion, George (played dramatically by Jack Nicholson) the attorney who got them out of jail, whose idea it was to go there in the first place. Peter Fonda's character was loyal to a fault when it came to his friendship with Billy. In THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES, Alberto (the horny rascal) was always pushing Ernesto to go out of his spiritual centeredness and jump into the dangerous fray of the more seedy side of life. Finally, in INTO THE WILD, it was ""Alexander Supertramp's"" intense reaction to the constant, dysfunctional fighting between his mother and father back home that pushed him on and outward to not ever end up in the same situation himself. We must also acknowledge that all of these characters were young and anxious to sew some of their wild oats, a natural condition of youth everywhere.

One might ask what would have happened to all of these characters if they had changed their minds along the way of their respective, individual quests and decided, instead, to stay with companions they had met along the way, or turn back and go back home? I remember when I first saw EASY RIDER as a kid, when it first came out in 1969. We all went to the movie theater as a group and all watched it together, getting a kick out of hippies smoking real pot, live and on camera. Some of us thought they should have stayed in the hippie commune. If they had lived, would they have stayed together? Would ""Captain America"" have gone back to be with those people? The same goes for INTO THE WILD. What would have happened if Christopher had stayed longer with his hippie friends in the trailer park? What would have happened if he left Alaska before the ice melted and went back to be with the girl he sang with who was a musician and who clearly cared for him? In THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES, what would have happened if Ernesto changed his mind and went back to be with his girlfriend? Would there have ever been a Cuban revolution? It's interesting that the characters in EASY RIDER had the goal of reaching a whorehouse, and the character in THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES - ""Che Guevara"" - was instrumental in ridding CUBA of all of its underworld-controlled and corrupt, exploitative whorehouses and gambling casinos! Who woulda thunk that - coming from this bookish, sensitive doctor!

Ultimately, what one comes away learning from all three of these films, and which is expressed at the end of INTO THE WILD by Christopher McCandless, is that what really matters most in life is true happiness and peace of mind, and that the only way to be truly fulfilled and happy is by sharing it with other people. Happiness can only be found in community. To reach a real community where you can truly be yourself and live an authentic life is a real blessing. Billy and ""Captain America"" never got the chance. Christopher McCandless learned this truth - but too late to live it. Only Ernesto reached the higher octave of societal existence and sustained a life on a higher level of community involvement through his unbending will and indomitable spirit to ""work for the good of the whole,"" as my friend, Al, likes to say. He was true to himself; that is, he took what he learned from being alone on the road away from home and brought it back with him to transform society back home and, ultimately, everywhere. He may have fallen off that damn, rickety, old motorcycle one too many times to be content with the trust in machinery and mechanical living to the extent that most people allow themselves to fall prey to. He found true freedom from the fold by transforming the fold itself, and it was life on the road that transformed him.

Thoreau said it best: ""In wilderness is the preservation of the world."" Wandering through the wilderness is dynamically healing!

That anger was mostly used to strike at the different and extreme... the different and extreme according to low to mid class whites. The movie reveals a great friendship between two, then three, traveling partners. Their friendship wasn't any different or perverse than those of people in the states through which they traveled. However, the prejudice that lived among the angry, older generation of the southern states proved to be unaccepting, even violent.

There is a parade in the next town. Do they have a permit? They meet a local character in the jail. Will he go to the Mardi Gras? Is there another society that is highly evolved? Is this just pretentious babbling to pad out the movie? They stop at a small town. People make comments, and they leave. Will somebody come after them? They arrive at that house of blue light.

8890,3,0767805534,"This is certainly the best independent film ever made and is also one of the best films ever.  This film succeeds in documenting the 60s counter-culture a.k.a. hippy generation very well and explores even deeper issues in addressing questions such as what is freedom and does it really exist in the ""land of the free and the home of the brave?""  Fonda and Hopper play a couple of bikers who ironically in trying to live a free life become hated by the mainstream who fear what this freedom represents.  This eventually results in their persecution and destruction.  I really enjoyed all the symbolism that inundates throughout the film from the insertion of the money into the gas tank painted with the Stars and Stripes symbolising how drug money obtained from drug pushing is effectively screwing the nation for example to the murderous scenes at the end symbolising the hypocrisy of a nation that espouses freedom that kills the very citizens that strive to practice it in its purest form.

Jack Nicholson is excellent here as the drunken lawyer who is sympathetic to the bikers at the ultimate personal cost although the entire cast I thought was very good.  This film also must contain what must be one of the best ever movie soundtracks which has been very well remastered into Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound quality.  The only unfortunate thing about this dvd version though is the poor picture quality which is full of imperfections such as white spots throughout.  Here's hoping the future Blu-ray release will address this issue.

Otherwise, this is an excellent film that attempts to hide nothing and to fully show life in a certain period of the 60s warts and all.  No film buff's dvd library should be without this title but wait for a properly restored version perhaps on Blu-ray to surface and give this version a miss.

Inspired film-making that rewards repeated viewing.

Updated 29 May 2011:

As Amazon will not allow me to review this separately the Blu-Ray version of this film is a little of a mixed bag as both the picture and sound qualities although an improvement over the dvd version are only slightly so.  As this was a low budget affair I suspect the 16 mm film can only look so much better even on 1080p without a proper restoration which hasn't been done here.  Still, if you haven't already got this film then this blu-ray version is the best there is to date but if you already have the dvd, it's tough to justify the double dip.  Maybe you will want to wait to see if a proper full-scale restoration is done on the picture quality for every frame and if they will provide a proper DTS HD MA 5.1 surround option as well as the Dolby True HD and PCM Surround options for some reason are not much better than the dvd version.",1218326400,3,2757,4.6419753086419755

But hey, that was the 60s, so maybe I was just reacting to the times.

But no.

Twenty years later I was asked to teach a course called ""The Journey of Life"" and use it as one of the pieces.

I was afraid it would not hold up.

I am glad to say I was wrong.

It held up splendidly.

It is one of those films that transcends itself.  Despite the shoestring budget and no-name actors (Hopper and Fonda and Nicholson were practically unknown), it pole-vaults into the category of National Myth.

It instantly harks back to one of the elemental themes in America: Seeking Freedom by Hitting the Open Road.

This goes way back--past Kerouac, past Whitman, past Huck and Jim lighting out for the territories, past Ishmael and Queequeg, past Leatherstocking and Chingachkook, past even Hester Prynne and Pearl.

Amazing how this archetype resonates.

The simplicity, the scenery, the topical references (like the parade in the small town; the hippie commune), the strange drug-spirituality in New Orleans, the violence.

8906,5,0767805534,"Easy Rider captures a time and spirit in America when the people on the left were the voices of true liberation, individuality and total freedom while those on the right stood for thought control and conformity.  My how times have changed.  Now the lefties are all about political correctness and repressive government taxes and regulations and the rightists ""say"" they want less intrusive government even though they are building a police state to protect us from enemies we can't seem to find. Basically, the home of the brave and the land of the free the two main characters were trying to find in this movie is even harder to find today.
This is partly why the themes in this movie should actually be seen as timeless even though the action takes place in a very abbreviated time in our history.  In fact, the story line has a Don Quixote quality to it that may not seem obvious to those who did not live in the 60's and share the initial dream of a utopian hippe society.  It is a movie about idealism though it may not seem like it on first viewing. In fact, if you did not live in this era you might find the whole premise of the film challenging because the values it celebrates are so thoroughly buried today.
For those of you who don't ""get"" this movie, here's the deal:
The boys start out buying drugs from some poor Mexicans and selling them to a rich dude to finance their freedom.  Not necessariy the best way to budget for a road trip, but definitley an anti-establishment approach to financial liberation in days when most drug deals were between friends and violence wasn't a factor. With the proceeds of this transaction, they purchase their freedom in the form of two beautiful custom chopper motorcycles they ride throughout the movie.  After Wyatt throws his watch in the dust and he and Billy hop on their rides - today they are probably the two most recognized bikes in the world - their search for true freedom in America begins. This is why they are on motorcycles in the first place, riding through the empty expanses of the southwest, visiting a small ranch (a conventional approach to a sort of independence) and a hippie commune(a non conventional approach that doesn't work out so well either).
When the two meet up with Nicholson, they find a lost soul who also longs to escape the confines of his environment by joining the hippies, but ultimately can't escape his local culture.  As great as Jack's role is, he is merely a prop in the overall story to illustrate the complex emmotions and reactions society had about the 60's counter culture as embodied in Wyatt and Billy.
The bordelo and drug sequence too is about exploring and exploding two of the most sacred myths of the hippie movement. This is the idea that free sex and drugs are liberating to the human spirit.  Our friends find that ultimately they are not. Instead they see the experience as confusing and hurtful and lead Wyatt to say ""they blew it"" after the episode is done.
This movie is ultimatley a tragedy as everyone who has seen it knows, just as the hippie movement itself was a beautiful dream that ended in tragedy for many in our society.
The folk and psychodelic rock music selected for this film could not be better, and the sequences of our protagonists cruising the open roads of northern Arizona and New Mexico to the sounds of Steppenwolf's ""Born to Be Wild"" and Hendrix's ""If Six Were Nine"" are among the most unforgetable on film.",1202342400,3,3446,4.610114192495922

8909,5,0767805534,"I have loved this film since it was first released and began playing at drive-ins all over America back in the 60s. The teaming of Peter Fonda (his top film), Dennis Hopper, and Jack Nicholson was pure brillance in casting.

The story is about two free spirits who score a big dope/cash connection in Mexico and then head east, cross-country on their chopper motorcycles, for New Orleans where they intend to celebrate Mardi Gras with the masses. Along the way, they encounter all manner of people and societies including poor Mexican families, hippies in a commune, really mean rednecks, and many more.

The larger theme here is the perceived freedom of the sixties, which turns out at every intersection to be little more than a fantasy. But I need to say right here that the filmscore for this movie represents one of the top Classic Rock albums of the 20th Century. Jimi Hendrix, Steppenwolf.... need I say more?

The top performance in this film, no question, was by Jack Nicholson who plays a drunken, seedy, small-town lawyer who throws caution to the wind and permanently forsakes his small-town life to ride with the boys to Mardi Gras, his pilgrammage of sorts.

If you have any interest whatever in the 60s, in rock music, or in the sociology of the free-love society, you really cannot afford to miss this incredible art-film. It's just superb!",1192665600,,1356,4.8068669527897

The sound track is incredible and this 35th anniversary DVD collection has a CD that includes the theme, ""Born to be Wild"" and many more.  I watched this classic movie again tonight for a different reason.

For those Amazon friends that know me, I am a motorcycle enthusiast.  I love and have a passion for all motorcycles from dirt, speed and street.  I currently have a custom Harley (I had the photo of it on my profile, but had to remove it).  I do ride it on the dangerous streets in the city where I live.  If you never rode, as the driver, you cannot appreciate the feeling---being on the back is not the same.  Motorcycle riding has given me plenty of confidence, and it has taught me to be a better driver in a car or a boat.  When I have a bad day or week (which is currently happening), I hop on the bike and it's amazing---your problems disappear (for the moment).  I was taught to ride by a guy I was supposed to marry who was a motorcross racer, but it didn't work out.  I was a young stupid kid then and if I continued that way I would have surely been a statistic.  My husband, Darrell, suggested I learn the right way all over again.  I enrolled in a course.  I had the most incredible teacher who did not make fun of me or get angry during class and was very patient.  I am 5'3"" and weigh about 100 pounds---pretty small to hold up a Harley.  He saw I was determined and cheered me on. Long after, when I had my accident he went over with me on how it happened, never ridiculing, but still teaching.  I wouldn't have been hurt had I had on my proper riding gear.  This one person, my teacher, Daniel David Jorasz was killed on his bike this past week, riding the right way.  A b@#ch lost control of her car trying to avoid a ladder, spun her car around on the freeway and hit Dan (""Double D"") head on, he was killed instantly.  Proper riding attire didn't matter, though.

37 years after 'Easy Rider' was first shown, I viewed the movie again. I was prepared to think I remembered the story, the story of an American myth, with anitheroes riding from the West only this time on bikes into the evil of middle America. I thought the best thing about the film was the soundtrack. It was an important film but not a very good one. Then I watched it, and I was hooked from scene one. The film drew me in, such a very good film. Not perfect but very good. Dennis Hopper's character,was so real, the dishelveled, long-haired. I remember many people who dressed and acted just like him. He directed the film and gave the character's names Wyatt and Billy, old west names discovering new territory. The acting was natural, not self-conciuous. It covers alot of territory in 90 plus minutes. The landscapes so beautiful and unspoiled. The surprises were the fact that Phil Spectre was cast as the connection- how trite and real is that? The early scene with the rancher and his family was one of the beautiful scenes of the film. Wyatt tells the rancher: ""It's not everyman who can live off the land, you know, doing his own thing his own time. You should be proud.""

The film comes alive when George, played by Jack Nicholsen as an ACLU lawyer. What a handsome dude, a purveyor of many roles to come. I remembered wondering about his character and thinking his Southern accent was too much and his football helmet silly. Now I understand about the football helmet and George's speech about how America used to be ""a helluva good country"". That night around the campfire, he samples grass for the first time, ""Lord have mercy, is that what that is?"" But best of all, is Peter Fonda and the quiet, intelligent, Captain America/Wyatt. He moves through the movie with, as my best friend would say, a noblesse oblige, a retired drug pusher who casts away his past and his allegiance to time with his wristwatch. Captain America and Billy find the whorehouse George directed them to and drop acid in the cemetery with two hookers, Karen Black in a great role. It is a long acid trip that sets the standard for hallucination portrayals for years to come. It's a bad trip, but maybe they chose the wrong place with the wrong people. And all is not well in the land of the free. A brief run-in with a few local yokels leads to their undoing. I'd thought Easy Rider would seem dated. Turns out it's timeless.

Easy Rider is a lengthy music video for the '60s culture. But it is also an honest perspective on the counterculture movement. Fonda and Hopper's portrayal of that experience is free of the romanticized tone that characterizes so many other films from this era. Fonda's dialogue the night before his death is a purveyor of things to come. Hopper is happy because they've made it to their destination with their drug money. ""We blew it,"" Fonda tells him. ""We blew it, man."" Heavy.

""Easy Rider is the late 1960s ""road film"" tale of a search for freedom (or the illusion of freedom) in a conformist and corrupt America, in the midst of paranoia, bigotry and violence. Released in the year of the Woodstock concert, and made in a year of two tragic assassinations (Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King), the Vietnam War buildup and Nixon's election, the tone of this 'alternative' film is remarkably downbeat and bleak, reflecting the collapse of the idealistic 60s. Easy Rider, one of the first films of its kind, was a ritualistic experience and viewed (often repeatedly) by youthful audiences in the late 1960s as a reflection of their hopes of liberation and fears of the Establishment.""

If someone is going to put out a special edition, then supposing we finally see a second disk with the 3 or so hours of deleted scenes? And I mean- a director's cut movie, not just a bunch of isolated deleted scenes. Also, if you're going to add bonus soundtrack items, how about including the Hendrix tune from the movie, which I think is about the only one i remember from the movie that is not in the original movie soundtrack lp. But.. besides me wanting to know what the other 3 hours was like, this movie is all time classic independent american cinema and highly recommended to anyone over 18. It has great performances by many folks down to the louisiana locals who were used to make the movie more authentic. The trip scene was bizare for its time and arguably even for today, but very relatable, if you are 'experienced'. The scenery is absolutely stunning (watch it in WIDEscreen).

8952,1,0767805534,"This movie is offensive in the same way that any movie that is truly about hippies would have to be. What that meens is this movie does not consist of the typical slapstick hippie stereo type that we usually get in stupid cartoons. This shows hippies for what they are, degenerates, and at the same time it demonizes the south. For a hippie, this movie would seem to be a moral statement, but to me it just seems to show how awful people can be. Shame on hippies for being , lazy, pot smoking, anti-establishment degenerates. But shame on the south too, for being filled with such hatred. But while I'm sure there are some people in the south that would have no problem shooting hipppies on spot for no apparent reason other than that they looked funny, I can't help but feel that the south were exagerated to certain extent. In conclusion though, this movie was enjoyable . I don't know why, but it was. I guess its just a very amusing look into the late 60s (something thats usually sugarcoated)from the ""other side"" lol. i would like to rate it higher, but I just can't bring myself to do it.

8955,5,0767805534,"Despite having aged in the last 30+ years, ""Easy Rider"" remains one of the most important and influential films ever made. Written by Dennis Hopper & Peter Fonda (with Terry Southern) and directed by Hopper; Easy Rider is a film that introduced the world to a rising young star named Jack Nicholson, a film that is on The American Film Institute's Top 100 List (#88), and is a brilliant look at the drug/hippie culture of the 60's. Fonda and Hopper play Wyatt & Billy, two men who experience freedom by riding their motorcycles around. The movie has such a lack of plot; I'm not even entirely sure how to sum it up. Even more amazing is how detailed and elaborate this film actually is. Carrying cocaine in one of the gas tanks, they ride around while encountering various eccentric characters. They also encounter ignorance, bigotry, and, eventually, George Hanson (Nicholson), a drunken lawyer who joins the boys on their ride. Nicholson got an Oscar nomination for his role and receives star billing, but isn't actually in the movie very long. He definitely steals the show, though. The movie, for me, evoked memories of a film called ""Midnight Cowboy."" It too had star-making performances (by Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight), took a look at the hippie/Andy Warhol-drug culture, and has a similar grainy look and feel to it. While I think Midnight Cowboy is a better film, Easy Rider is a more important one. Almost anyone who watches it will agree that time hasn't been very kind to the movie, yet people still watch this movie to this day. It's #88 on The American Film Institute's List, but if that list was in order of watched most frequently it would place in the top 10 (probably below or next to Pulp Fiction, Casablanca, The Godfather, A Clockwork Orange, etc.). One of the best (and most haunting) moments comes in the end. That inevitable moment would be changed in today's Hollywood in favor for a happy ending. This is the only ending that could've worked for a movie about guys like these. This is an unforgettable motion picture experience.

8957,2,0767805534,"This is one of those movies that is on the AFI's ""Top 100 films of all time"" list. In my opinion that list is bogus. Only about a quarter of the films on that list deserve to be there. I don't think Easy Rider is anywhere close to one of the top 100 films of all time. Easy Rider seems fairly pointless. Billy(Dennis Hopper) and Wyatt (Peter Fonda) drive around on their choppers, pick up a hippie, and drive around some more. That sums up the first half of the film. Don't get me wrong, it isn't exactly boring, but it isn't exactly a great story either. To be honest this movie doesn't really have a story.

Dennis Hopper directed this film and the word is that he was completely stoned out of his mind. I can believe that. There is a scene at the end where the Billy and Wyatt drop some acid and go on a little trip with two hookers in a cemetary. To me it seems pretty easy to shoot an acid trip. Just shoot random stuff, cut it together randomly and voila! You have your scene. Or better yet, give the camera to a monkey. The out of focus shots and frenetic animal jerkiness will only add to the overall aesthetic of the scene. Its ok for the first 20 seconds, but anything longer than that gets monotonous.

Jack Nicholson is amazing as usual. He is so good, so convincing, and has such presence that he completely steals every scene that he is in. The other actors are good too in their own ways; Dennis Hopper made me laugh several times, but then again watching stoned guys do stupid things will usually make you laugh anyway.

The cinematography is very good. Lszl Kovcs does good work and he captures the scenery very well. God knows there is plenty of time for that during the course of the movie. There is a little incongruity towards the end when they try to match 16mm footage with the rest of the 35mm film, but other than that the picture is good. There are some weird things done with the editing that I didn't really understand or care for. There is a reoccuring theme of stuttering images before cutting to a new scene. It kind of seems like a film student experiment that was left in the film accidently.

I'll bet this movie was great back in the days of hippies and woodstock, but now it just comes off flat. It does give some insight into that time period, but there are many other better films that can do the same thing and tell you a story at the same time.

Well, considering the times it was made, it was a radical departure from the norm. Nudity, pot smoking and perhaps other no-nos of that period.

The story is kinda boring. Two motorcycle enthusiasts take a trip to New Orleans to go to Mardi Gras. There is tragedy because of prejudice and so there is a sad quality to this film. Still, it's not a great movie just ahead of it's time...maybe. Plus it introduced the great actor Jack Nicholson.",1155427200,,621,4.175
8959,3,0767805534,"I must say, this movie was interesting in how it carried itself. It reflected a nice idea of how the sub-culture of freedom was mashed with the majority of close-minded fools. It had some of the same ideals I tend to have about the mixing of beliefs.

The movie gave you plenty of images of how Wyatt and Billy's life could be. Buying their own farmland, living on a commune, or even catering to the majority and living in an all prejudice town. It even talks about the idea of perfect communism (Which is unachievable by man) in Jack Nickolson's UFO speech. You look at the lifestyles of the commune and the two bikers and see how redneck bigotism treats this change from the socially acceptable. There are plenty of subtle messages in this movie that you would have to think about to understand.

I bet almost anyone would tell you that Jack Nickolson portrayed George Hanson better than any being on earth. That's because it's true. Unless you are the redneck bigot as explained above, you can't help, but like George. Sure, he may be a drunkard, but he is the embodiment of activism for freedom and sanity in this world. He just wants everyone to get along. He also shows that even someone from the south does have common sense. This is perfect, considering many pre-judgements upon southern people. You just wish he didn't have to die, but because of how pro-freedom minds were treated, it was inevitable.

Although this movie has wonderful ideas and promotes a humanitarian view, it doesn't quite always get the ideas down well. I found the movie to be very plain in the beginning, because I found that to be one of the most boring drug runs I've ever seen on movie. I might have missed something with the planes going over the car, but that seemed like a waste of time to me. It trails you off until you reach the farm and start to see some ideas grow. Another part was Mardi Gras. I felt like that man could have done anything better than he did. It wasn't the drugs that bothered me. It was how they enacted self-demoralization, which I felt wasn't really important to what the movie was trying to say. I was so excited for Mardi Gras and a big let-down fell over me when I saw it. The prostitutes were fun, the idea of going out was amazing, and BAM! I already get proselytized enough. If these things were out of the movie, I would have enjoyed it more.

The ending couldn't have been more true. This was really the way it had to be, considering the time-frame they want to cover. It had all the things to leave you feeling cold inside. That's the way a strong tragedy ends. This ending was so good, it was covered by the Venture Brothers in the last episode of the first season where the two boys die.

To head onto the book, I found it almost pointless. It just seemed like a bunch of vanity rolled into ready made bong material. The book could have been perfect if it just had explained all the signs in the movie. No one cares about Fonda picking his nose. Unless you want to, of course.

The biggest failure of this movie is how corporate capitalism rips off the public with it's ""songtrack"". People want to watch the movie and if they like the music, listen to the full version soundtrack. If you want to buy this, get the non-special edition.

"" was more than the opening theme song of this the creation of two then little known counter culturalists, Hopper and Fonda, and their sidekick Nicholson. You have to remember when this was created, the summer of 1969 to 1970, we were faced with all sorts of stains on the theme of America, or as Codeleesa Rice once quipped, America with 'its birth defects.'

Captain America and Billy score big in a drug sale and take us on a tour of America, heading for Mardi Gras. Along the way they hit the highs and lows of the then American Dream. In a time only a few years after the murder of the Civil Rights workers in Philadelphia, Mississippi, Brown versus The Board of Education, and still dual drinking fountains, Wyatt (Fonda) and Billy (Hopper) try to get served in the South, pick up Nicholson, smoke a lot of herb, and eventually are crushed by their dream. It's a poetic piece which meant a lot to us when we saw it. Regrettably, there were wrongs with that America and Fonda and Hopper were subtle enough to point some of them out without being too heavy handed. They let us see the South they saw and listen to the rather haunting words of Nicholson.

8988,4,0767805534,"This review is for the 1999 (40th Anniversary Edition) Columbia DVD.

The movie in a nutshell involves two hippies, Wyatt (Peter Fonda) also known as ""Captain America"" and Billy (Dennis Hopper), who score a huge cocaine deal in Mexico and unload it on a rich guy (Phil Spector) in California.  The two then decide to travel by motorcycle to the Mardi Gras in New Orleans to have a great time.  This sets up the rest of the film for many offbeat and bizarre encounters on this free-spirited road trip.

I was only ten years old when 'Easy Rider' came out, and without even seeing it, I can recall how popular the movie was.  In fact, it was very common to see a large black & white poster of Peter Fonda on his chrome chopper, with the helmet and gas tank colorized in florescent red, white and blue.  For the counterculture/anti-establishment crowd, it would seem that traveling cross country on a Harley with a stash of money, drugs along with easy sexual encounters was the new American dream.  It wasn't until recently I had the chance to watch this film in its entirety on DVD, and the sense of free-spirited travel across scenic landscapes holds up well and so does a lot of the music, especially songs like ""Born to be Wild"" and several of the songs by the Byrds.  In addition, the movie has some great moments including just about every scene that features Jack Nicholson.  But sadly, communal living, acid trips, getting high on pot, having unprotected sex with prostitutes and dealing drugs for money just dates this film miserably.  All of this wouldn't be necessarily bad especially if it was a bust-your-gut comedy, but unfortunately the film idealizes this lifestyle and plays too heavy-handed against their stereotypical Southern oppressors - especially in the final scene.  Overall, I did like this movie for the cinemetography, music and nostalgia, but wasn't at all sold on the manipulative and outdated message.  However, it's definitely one of these movies like Woodstock, that brings insight, be it good or bad, into the hippie counter-culter of the late 1960's.

The DVD picture quality is great.  I can only recall seeing roughly four or five tiny specs of film deterioration during the entire film.  The colors and sharpness are fantastic and the stereo sound is excellent too.  The making of the movie bonus feature is very insightful as a lot of details about the motorcycles, the production and background of the film are brought to light.  Dennis Hopper also gives audio commentary for the main feature.

Easy Rider is, overall, a story about death. Capt. America (Peter Fonda) and Billy (Dennis Hopper), like a modern day Don Quixote, set out for Mardi Gras and the American Dream (freedom).

Instead, they wind up tripping in the Old Cemetery, with flashforwards to Capt. America's burning motorcycle. In the final campfire scene, Peter Fonda remarks, ""We blew it"".

The film represents the death of the American Dream; but, in respect to the KATRINA disaster, represents the death of New Orleans, and the Death of America itself in the aftermath of the hurricane. Capt. America comes to this realization, as did so many Americans in late August 2005, that ""We blew it"".

9011,5,0767805534,"I just bought the DVD to watch on a new big television when i get around to choosing one.

I can remember when the film came out. It was even adverised in Readers Digest.

By the time I had bought my first Harley and began to turn on it was the early 70's and the 60's were regarded as a definitive and Golden Time. The film was shown in Dampier in 1972 in a landscape similar to Southern California,.Red  scrubby rocky hills brooding on Time. Stained rivers run through sand. Startling glaring sunshine.

So I could relate to the landscape really well, and the tolerant stoned behaviour and the bigotted persecution.

The intolerance is noticed because as Hippies you want to make connection and seek recognition and acceptance from all the community.

 You have something major to contribute, namely perception free of attachment.

Thus you are working on being truly free.

The structures in society are not fully based on an authentic rational psychology, they are based on inflationary projection of  influential people usually in a state of denial. The broader societal culture needs to allow individuals to experiment,to get things wrong, to apologise without wanting a pound of flesh. It needs to nurture and us and to maintain authentic nurturing behavioural examples that guide us.

It is that insight and the practice of sincere positive sorting out your mind and your actions that makes Free people a threat to

any one in Denial.

 Control freaks need to control  the culture of society around them in order to maintain their equilibrium.

This is one of the messages of the film. In a conservative confomist culture like the USA what are social democratic norms in countries like Australia or Europe were and are seen as a threat to that society's status quo. The National Denial Structure is about to be unravelled. The conceptual reality is about to be changed and they don't seem to have to tools to travel into new ways of perception.

Any way would like a cd player on my Triumph so I can listen to the great soundtrack from this film.

Technically it may have its faults but overall it got the spirit correct. Also the documentary is invaluable.

9012,2,0767805534,"I finally got around to watching this ""landmark"" - this ""generational touchstone."" After 35 years of cultural saturation - the music, the Academy Award montages, the one-liners - I watched it. Or at least I tried. It was extraordinarily disappointing. I'll bet I ""had to be there.""

Here's a movie which deliberately portrays late-sixties counter-culture with the ""counter"" component completely missing from the self-awareness of its participants. The characters are portrayed not as culturally savvy human beings who have tuned in, turned on and dropped out, but rather as pie-eyed mildly retarded adults on chrome-moly hobbyhorses frolicking across the country occasionally bumping into folk who misunderstand their unmeasured, playful skinny-dipping innocence. If this film weren't so revered it would be endearing as an interesting museum piece - not as a cinematic record of 60's culture, but as an unwitting artifact of 60's culture. As a film to be revered it fails.  As an artifact it is as successful as a piece of Sumerian cuneiform.

But the film is preachy - in the non-verbal way that films can be - in the way that the choir can never quite notice. The scene where Jack Nicholson smokes ""grass"" is hilarious for all the wrong reasons. Here's an early-thirties ACLU lawyer in 1969 written to act all agog at the sight of weed. ""You mean...mar-i-wa-na??"" he gawks like he's being offered the ignition key to an alien spacecraft.

In fact the only salient problem with this movie is that it tells a small, feeble lie - and does so in a silly sales-pitchy way. It lies by underplaying the deliberate and wry character of 60's counter-culture in an effort to intersect its participants' motivations with traditionally appreciated dispositions like joy and innocence and googly-eyed curiosity - and it does so with a dishonest straight face. It is the inverse of Reefer Madness pitched dry. All bitternes, measurement and calculation is attributed to the capitalists, rednecks, homophobes and jingos who litter the woods, the coffee shops and the highways. The net-effect this film had on American culture was as a springboard for the American motorcycle aftermarket industry - as anyone who is IN that industry, such as myself, can attest to. Thousands of would-be Captain Americas rebelled against ""the man"" by giving ""the man"" their paychecks in exchange for fork tubes, flag helmets and chopper 'zines.

The superb music sounds like a replay of AM radio of that era, and the scenes still bring a hunger and longing of wanderlust and desire to crank up the bike.  The acting is, of course, what it is - a tad contrived in spots, artful in others, but comes together in mildly appalling reminiscences of those smoky campfire scenes of yore - how did we ever survive those years!

Although the couch potatoes often think so, the movie ending hostility and brutality wasn't all that contrived, and I can vividly recall being bodily run out of a much needed gas-stop in rural Mississippi back then, just for the crime of showing up on a bike wearing leather (it was November...) -- and even today, not every motel looks kindly on bikes unless they're of the Tupperware barge variety.  Never mind that Easy Rider starts with a drug buy, we were pretty naive back then, the general peaceful wandering of the two says as much about the era, and those of us who were too wiped out to truly remember the 60's, as, say, Star Trek says about the social issues we attempted to wrestle with...

There isn't to much naughty words but the drug use is FREQUENTLY and the 60's soundtrack like hard rock and country music is also frequently. This movie can be known as a hippie movie than a motorcycle movie.

The bad things were: NO action, NO high speed and a uncool ending.

P.S: If you are a 60's fan then you should also buy Midnight Cowboy and the Woodstock concert so you can have three movies including this one that represent it's time in a very COOL way!

Usually called ""The original biker movie"", Easy Rider is about two bikers from L.A. who take off on a cross-country trip to New Orleans for Mardi Gras. On the way, they make some new friends, one in particular named George Hansen played by Jack Nicholson, the ""lawyer with the ACLU"". Dennis Hopper won ""Best New Director"" at the 1969 Cannes Film Festival for his work on this movie. This movie also introduced the world to 3 time Academy Award winner Jack Nicholson. Also, this film was the first film that featured actors smoking REAL marijuana on screen. Yes, they were actually stoned, believe it or not. The 35th anniversary DVD is a re-release of the 30th anniversary edition. The only difference is that it features the Easy Rider soundtrack on CD and contains the 80-page British Film Institute Modern Classic book ""Easy Rider"". The transfer is flawless, especially for a 60's film. The 30th anniversary DVD contains a 1.85:1 widescreen presentation with Dolby Digital 5.1 and Dolby Surround 2.0 soundtracks, and extras such as the documentary ""Easy Rider: Shaking the Cage"", and a commentary by Dennis Hopper.

9018,5,0767805534,"Driven with an excellent sound track this is a film about two guys how throw their legs across their choppers and head out on the highway for adventure.  What could be any more ""biker"" than that?  As they wander with little direction they come across and leave, without recognizing it, the one thing they are searching for.  Near the end of the film one braggs about reaching the American dream while the other finally realizes they were fools and missed their dreams.  The film ends with audience pathos at the sadness of two high ideal losers who could have had it all.  Perhaps this is a commentary on the counter culture of the period.  We had high ideals and recognized the failures of the previous generation, but had trouble pulling it all together ourselves.

Now, everytime I throw my leg across my Harley and head out for a road trip I stick my Steppenwolf CD in and relive the adventure, in 21st century fashion of course.

TRIVIA:

My favorite song from the dvd, ""Born To Be Wild"" describes motorcycle engines as ""Heavy Metal Thunder"".  This reference gave birth to a new name for hard, driving, rock music.

The movie is disturbing, hard to follow, and born of the counter culture, circa 1970.",1119830400,3,1216,4.657276995305164

I lapped up every minute of Easy Rider, of course there is very little plot, but that is not the reason you watch it.  The stylised late sixties 'acid induced' camera work, fabulous sound track and wonderful male leads is a testament that even when people are doped to the eye balls some stories are begging to be told.  This film was so of its time - almost like the foretelling of the autumn and winter of the 'Summer of Love' when the warm fluffy ideaologies where crumbling and decaying and the establishment where again ascertaining their will.

Dennis Hopper is so wonderful in this he holds the screen.  His maniac/OCD behaviour is a foretaste of many of the great characters he portrayed in the 70's, but also a stern reminder of his own personal descent, that thankfully now he has overcome.  Of course like many films of this time and even now the females are just window dressing.  It does frustrate me a bit because I like many of my contemporaries imagine myself on a big Harley cruising through the landscape, any way 'the times they are a changing' and some day I hope we will see more strong, sassy and beautiful women on the screen.",1115856000,3,1252,4.464912280701754
9020,3,0767805534,"The best part of this DVD is the bonus ""Making of Easy Rider"" documentary.  It unintentionally helps to deflate all the current bloated ideas about the significance of this movie.  Take this movie for what it is: a film with two hippies enjoying freedom by riding cool bikes through beautiful scenery with cool music.  Add to it some good acting by Jack Nicholson (which offsets Peter Fonda's atrocious acting) and some fairly good documentation of the zeitgeist, and it's certainly worth 90 minutes of your time.  But don't look to this as a profound comment on life and society, because it's too mixed up and/or lightweight.

Why was it mixed up?  Partially because everyone except the cinematographer was stoned all the time, including the director Dennis Hopper.  No one was really in charge.  Everyone had big ideas for how things should go, more than half the dialogue was improvised, and lots of other things were determined on the fly as well (after huge arguments). The funniest revelation in the ""Making Of"" documentary was the fact that Hopper's original cut of the movie was three hours long! He apparently thought he was making a huge statement with this thing, but it really just shows his lack of directorial judgement and clear concept of what he was trying to accomplish.

There's a lot of silly, amateurish symbolism in the film: the scene where Peter Fonda throws off his watch, the simultaneous horseshoeing and motorcycle tire-fixing, the ""Wyatt"" and ""Billy"" cowboy stuff, etc.  The ""Making Of"" documentary reveals that the guys thought they were packing the film with a lot of other symbolism as well, none of it very well done: the cemetary statue that Peter Fonda talks to is supposed to represent the Statue of Liberty; when the plastic tube full of drug money is being shoved inside Peter Fonda's Stars and Stripes gas tank, that's supposed to represent money screwing America; and so on.

When the guys producing/directing a film have no real focus,  are making it up as they go along, have no self-editing abilities to begin with, then aggravate that problem by staying stoned all the time, it's expecting too much for there to be a coherent end product.  What is the message of this movie anyway?  There's probably a little morality tale in there somewhere, something along the lines of ""freedom is good, prejudice is bad"", but to read much more than that into it is to wander into a thicket of half-constructed themes that aren't very well thought out or presented.

So, don't take it too seriously.  It's definitely better than the rest of the biker films of the era, because it doesn't rely on the scandalous antics of depraved Hell's Angels-types.",1115078400,4,2680,4.857142857142857
9041,2,0767805534,"I can't help, but ask that question. I really wasn't that impressed with this movie. I feel that it really didn't explain what the 60's were all about. I feel that what it did was tell everyone ""Party, and you'll be alright."" It just didn't gel together enough for me as I feel that the 60's may have been just a complete waste of time. I know one scene that really gripped me was when the main characters go to this hippie commune, and we see a guy who's is obviously stoned out of his mind holding a little baby who's crying, and while it makes the guy disturbed he doesn't do anything about it; Let's face it to me what the father of that baby was wanting was to have someone take that baby away from him so he can get back to the free sex, and the drugs. You see I feel that the movie would've sold me better if it was more geared towards the values the people were trying to hold to back then. I know that the decade was about equality, and world peace, and how everybody wanted them so bad, but the movie looks more on the selfish side of the hippies. With the main characters scoring alot of money from a drug buy, and the carefree style of just traveling along the country without a care in the world. The only character I feel was worth something was played by Jack Nicholson. A lawyer who seemed so dissilousioned with the way things were that he joins Hopper and Fonda for awhile on the trip. I know that during this decade everyone was wondering what's going on? Was the way our parents raised us, and the values they tried to instill in us wrong? This is understandable considering everybody was starting to think more broader. I can't say if it was because of the drugs, or not that caused everyone to start challenging the values of thier parents, but that's where the movie should've been centered. I just can't help, but feel that Fonda's character was right ""We Blew It."" I know that's what happened with this movie here. A somewhat decent soundtrack, but it's not the masterpiece that everyone feels that it is. I know that this is tough stuff, but I've kept silent about it for 16 years, and it was time to release my feelings on this movie. I feel that it revealed to me that this hippie culture is one of self-indulgence, and escaping responsibilities. It's not about peace, or love. Now there is no resolution as the former hippies have gone on to represent the people they hated, and they've developed a callous attitude that the people they hated had, so what are we to believe? Are we to accept this on blind faith? Well some people may say yes as once again the movie left me feeling with one of the songs from the Blind Faith album ""Do What You Like"".",1114646400,7,2679,4.328031809145129
9042,5,0767805534,"Easy Rider, the winner of the Cannes Film Festival (Best Film by a new Director) speaks volumes about the time in which it was made: the pinnacle of one of the most socially tumultuous periods in U.S. history.

 Easy Rider falls roughly inside the lines of the master narrative of the western. The hero is an outlaw named Wyatt (Peter Fonda), his partner is Billy (The Kid, presumably, played by the film's director, Dennis Hopper). The sub-narrative is the road, and this time a couple of longhair hippies ride it on motorcycles.

 Billy is a loner who can't wait to get out of almost every place that he and Wyatt visit. It's the sense of family, and community, that Billy doesn't feel comfortable with. He's his own man, or wants to be, and community is anathema to his character. Wyatt takes it in stride, and besides, he tells Billy, ""We're eating their food.""

The ACLU lawyer, George Hanson (Jack Nicholson) joins the pair and finds inspiration and new joy in life from the road experience. Wyatt and Billy are not just longhairs but, as George tells Billy, ""No, what you represent to them (the hostile locals) is freedom.""

American Individualism, in 1969, was a classic thread running throughout American history, as was communalism. What was spectacular not only about Easy Rider but the sixties overall was the sense of blending of these two major threads in American history. The tension between Billy the Kid and the Hippie commune can be viewed, among other things, as the cinematic representation of the struggle for true Individualism in the Anglo American psyche. There is no ready resolution to this dichotomous past.

 What Easy Rider does is lay out the bare bones of a classic American dilemma and invite the viewer to piece them together. The film is European art-house style. This is no ordinary cowboy movie. Dennis Hopper's directing is not merely brilliant; innovative would be an understatement. Lazslo Kovakcs' cinematography is more than breathtaking; it's magical. A fine classic to own and watch through the years, to think about and enjoy.",1114300800,2,2071,4.91404011461318
9043,4,0767805534,"_Easy Rider_ is, of course, one of the most important pioneer independent films of the 1960s film movement.  It is the classic biker flick: two guys traveling across the Southwest United States searching for themselves and this country.  Thus, I have a hesitant recommendation.  Few other films that I have seen capture this time period with such accuracy, vision, and emotional power.  However, if you're not into ""road trip"" movies of the 1960s and 1970s, you might be bored by the film's spontaneous dialogue and long visual riding sequences set to great music.

This film reminded me, in many ways, of the movie _Vanishing Point_, most likely because that film came out two years after _Easy Rider_.  Both depict a lost generation, endlessly searching for something that isn't there, only to be sacrificed for their journey.  The acting in this film is terrific and the meaninglessness of the film's ending is heartbreaking for those audience members who desperately seek to find the same thing that these two free spirits are searching for.

I found the ""Making of"" featurette on this DVD edition to be very informative and really well done.  In fact, it is one of the better featurettes I have seen.  Hopper and Fonda (among others) take us behind the scenes into the magical making of this film and how it all just seemed to flow naturally, largely unscripted.  A word to the wise: you might want to check out the 35th anniversary edition.  While I have heard that the quality of the DVD is not improved, there is a soundtrack CD and a nice booklet for any true fan of the film.

9044,1,0767805534,"This is another work of liberal propoganda from the sixtys

designed to encourage children to turn on their country,

drop out and use drugs.

The story (if you can call it that) has two drug dealers riding

motorcycles across the american west.  They are smuggling drugs

the whole way.  Its less a movie than a music video because

nobody in the film can really act.  Endless motocycle panoramas

set to music followed by a seemingly endless trip-out scene

where our boys play around in a graveyard with whores and

mock the idea of religion.

The film is full of the liberal paranoid view of America.  That

Americans who work, have families, have jobs, are clean and

don't do drugs sit around all day plotting how to kill everyone

else.  Its always news to them, but real Americans are far too

busy working and living their lives to care much about what

a bunch of deadbeats are up to.

Peter Fonda spends the whole film in love with himself.  I can

imagine after every take him pulling out a mirror and grooming

himself.  The other guy (Hopper) is a dirtball.  He must have

been out of it nearly the whole time because they go out of their

way to reduce his lines down to nothing.  Nicholson is the only

person in the movie who can half-way act, and at best he gives

a B-grade supporing character actor performance.

And by hippie-liberal logic, since Nicolson is the only actor

here, he gets the least screen time and gets killed off real

quick.  As is always the case under socialism, the punishment

for showing that your better than other people is severe.

At the end of the film, our druggie heros get shot to death

out on the road by regular america for no reason.  The day

before they get shot, Fonda tells the dirty guy ""we blew it""

forshadowing that they were going to be punished and killed.

By liberal logic, Hopper and Fonda blew it (and brought death

on themselves) because as noble as liberals consider drug

smuggling, it also could be considered work.  Work for

these kind of guys is the ultimate crime against nature.

This film and its two dirtballs turn the concept of freedom

around.  Freedom was never about freedom from work or freedom

to use lots of drugs.  Freedom is about opportunity, not

being a parasite.",1110326400,20,2260,4.5363408521303255

And the book is a little dry for my liking - focused too much on the film-industry aspects and not enough on the times that generated the movie and what it meant to all of us who lived (even partially) during those times.
On the positive side, I'd never seen the documentary about the making of the film, and it was affirming to learn that most of the actors really were stoned out of their minds while they were making the movie...one always wonders about these things.

I truly enjoyed it though I wasn't a heavy pot smoker type in those days. I love bikes and the idea of riding across the country in the 60's was much more of an adventure than it is today. Believe me.

The philosophical viewpoints being expressed by Hopper and Fonda are a close look into the basic feelings many young Americans had in those days. The conflict in one's mind of the idea of what freedom means to different people is excellent reference material for anybody analyzing where they stand on such matters. It was amazing Dennis and Peter didn't want to make judgment on the Viet Nam War by talking about it or showing scenes they could have included. See the CD to see what I mean. I believe that was good choice. College profs should make a lesson plan based on this movie. Us old guys remember the times like it was yesterday. New young whippersnapper college students will see this as ancient history.

The best part of the documentary is the inclusion of real people along the way picked on the spur of the moment by Hopper. They give the film far and above what any actor could bring to the screen for authenticity. That's what makes this film a cult classic...a legend in the movie business if you will. Those real people are incredible. See it for yourself as they go over those scenes - shear brilliance on Hoppers part.

Among many of the kind Americans they run into along the way is the one and only Jack Nicholson, an alcoholic ACLU attorney who helps them out of jail. In return, they decide to take him to New Orleans with them and get him stoned in the process (the funniest scene in the movie--Nicholson offers an inspiring monologue concerning extraterrestrial intelligence). Enduring harassment and abuse from the rural locals, they arrive at Mardi Gras. Tony Basil(!) is one of the hookers they drop acid with in the graveyard (an unsettling psychedelic sequence only surpassed by the climax of ""2001: A Space Odyssey""). Sounds great, doesn't it? It is. Despite its flaws and shortcomings, this is an American classic not to be missed.

Any fan of independent films will adore this movie (check out ""Midnight Cowboy"", too, if you like this one). The acting is amateurish but the script is inspired, and the cinematography and soundtrack are terrific.

This movie is a symbolic snuff film, and the American Dream is the victim in the spotlight. It foreshadows the paranoia and hostility that would later precipitate the War On Drugs and, now, the War On Terror. Ironically, the alcoholic lawyer played by Jack Nicholson is the only person that has a clear and sober idea of what is going on, and he is quickly silenced by the barbaric locals. The two main characters themselves have a vague idea of it, but are too caught up in their own hedonism to see it clearly. Near the end of the film, Peter Fonda grimly concludes: ""We blew it.""

9071,5,0767805534,"""Easy Rider"" directed by Dennis Hopper, produced by Peter Fonda and written by Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper and Terry Southern was a low budget film ($340 grand) that surprisingly became a box office smash. The story is about two hippys (Fonda & Hopper) who buy choppers with cash they've gotten from a drug deal. They ride cross country heading to Louisianna (to Mardi Gras) and on their way meeting different people, visiting a commune of hippys, ending up in jail, going to a brothel, taking acid etc. The ending was disturbing in 1969 and still is, even in these days of non-stop violence in our country.

Frankly, I think it's quite prophetic. Look at our world today. 'nuf said.

I say this after attending a showing of ""Easy Rider"" and his directoral debut, ""The Hired Hand"", (which really was quite interesting), in Houston with Peter Fonda being present for commentary and pressing flesh. Afterwards, he spoke about each film. True, the quality of ""Easy Rider"" is low. It was made in the late 1960's, whad'da ya want? They used the best they had back then. Also, another problem due to Columbia throwing it in the vaults and to forget about it. This improper storage resulted in a reel suffering water damage. I believe it has been generously restored by Sundance.

""Easy Rider"" is about freedom, freedom being taken away. Sure, it's dated and funny to watch those 3 well-known actors in their early days getting baked around a campfire, but it has a message...",1096675200,7,1078,4.885245901639344
9073,3,0767805534,"""Easy Rider"" is the 60s counter-culture classic that seems to wreak slightly of formaldehyde today. It stars Peter Fonda (Wyatt) and Dennis Hopper (Bill) as a pair of drugged out loners who trade a formidable amount of cocaine to `Connection' (Phil Specter) for a sizable amount of cash. Unfortunately, the best that either Wyatt or Bill can think of doing with their new found wealth is to mount a pair of truly sweet cycles and roam the countryside - looking for trouble and, ultimately finding more than they bargained for.  Along the way they enter into an on again off again tempestuous relationship with loose canon George Hanson (Jack Nicholson). Together the boys go through a heap of money, a string of hookers and more than a few ounces of psychedelic trippin'. Nothing seems to help cleanse these reprobates of their rebel without a clue - little boys lost - syndrome. Fueled by a soundtrack that features Steppenwolf's classic ""Born to Be Wild,"" ""Easy Rider"" is anything but, and perhaps, the closest realization of the decade's hippy counterculture ever put on film. That it today seems quaint in its hostility toward authority only serves to reflect just how lost contemporary film culture is.

Previously, ""Easy Rider"" had been made available through Columbia Tristar in a moderately pleasing DVD transfer. If you're thinking of upgrading to this new 35th Anniversary edition for a better print of the film don't bother. This is the exact same transfer and extras previously made available. The only pluses to this edition are an extra CD of the film's soundtrack and a nicely put together pocket book on the making of the film. But the DVD quality remains the same. As for the quality of the transfer - beginning as it does with several long shots of the boys on their bikes, there is a remarkable amount of resolution to be had in the image. Fine details are nicely realized for the most part and colors, while slightly dated, exhibit a fairly accurate level of contrast and balance. Unfortunately, roughly mid-way through this transfer some strange digital happenings begin to occur, beginning with the flashback sequence in which Wyatt and Bill pick up a pair of hookers. Designed to reflect to an audience that the sequence is going on in the mind of the boys, its exceptionally grainy and slightly out of focus with a bleached out color scheme that is unflattering to say the least. On top of the inherent grain in the print we get an exceptional amount of digital grit which generally makes for a very harsh looking image. Also, the print quality after the flashback - which until its insertion had been moderately pleasing to very nicely done - is increasingly riddled with age related artifacts and grain which degrades the final third of the film's image quality. I really am unable to account for the reason this occurs but it does and is distracting. The audio is 5.1 and, as expected, dated. Dialogue is never natural sounding, obviously manufactured post production studio recordings that are tinny at best. The one kick that the audio gets is in its throbbing rock score that jumps to life with an explosive bass and vibrating treble.",1096156800,42,3164,4.846580406654343
9074,5,0767805534,"I was utterly surprised by this film. I was expecting nothing more than some short scenes of our now-infamous actors smoking marijuana followed by trippy Willy Wonka scenes . Oddly, this did occur, but this film was much more than that. This film should be shown in every American History class in the United States. It not only showed the beauty of the country of which we reside, but it also spoke about the people that reside in it. You know the old saying, ""Guns don`t kill people, people kill people"", well after watching this film, it is a very true statement. We are afraid of what is different. We are a culture that is afraid of change, yet seek it so badly. We are a society of hypocrites, androids, and ignorants. We thrive on the fact that we are the best country in the world, yet somebody shows any disassociation of routine, we are the first to question and get angry. I would dare say that we have moved so far from the 60s that I cannot see why our parents do not cry everyday. Their generations was a free-spirited, mind challenging culture that explored all possibilities no matter the cost. The experience was all they needed as a reward. Now, we are more concerned about money and the family-plan that we sometimes place ourselves on the backburner to life. Wake, eat, and pay the bills. What a sad daily structure that we have. When was the last time you considered the possibility of just jumping on your bike and riding until you hit water? Probably not for a long time ... why? It is called ""bills"" and ""responsibilities"". These are the choices that we chose to make, and for anyone to say that they cannot do it, I would have to challenge. You CAN do anything, it is whether you chose to do it is another question. I wonder what it will be like in another 30 years. Where will we be, and will the idea of individualism be lost? I can't wait to see ...

Outside of the deeply rooted themes of this film, I felt that Hopper (who also directed) knew exactly what he was doing behind the camera. He kept the talking short, the music loud and symbolic, and allowed the background to do the explaining. I loved the fact that we really knew nothing about Fonda or Hopper's characters. It allowed us to relate to them. You could easily add your story into their characters and have the life that you lead and wish to escape. Hopper was able to transform this film from a drug movie to a film about humanity. Fonda, who also helped write the film with Hopper, did a superb job of adding Nicholson's character into the mix.

Nicholson represented us, the American public and our love of liquor, football, and lies. I viewed Nicholson as the average American. He drank too much, was the product of a wealthy upbringing, but did not know much about the world. He was sheltered. He never smoked weed (in fact didn't even know what it was when presented to him), never left the state line, and never lived life. He constantly used the expression, ""I have always wanted to ..."". How many times do you hear this a day from either a family member or a co-worker? If you always wanted to do it, why haven't you? So, here we have Hanson, dreaming a dream but never following through, who is traveling with two guys that live the ultimate life and live by their own rules. They are complete opposites, but Hanson's words seemed to remain in my mind for a long time. He reminded me of one of my wife's students today that spoke about freedom. He knew exactly what it was, but never practiced it. Hopper and Fonda were walking (driving most of the time) representations of the word ""freedom"". It is tragic what happens to Harmon, because he (unfortunately) experienced the negative side of freedom ... hatred and fear of the unknown.

There was one scene that just jumped out at me. It occurs in the diner before the incident later that night where our travelers experience hatred in the country they admire so much. They go from peace and love to fear and hate. It is as if they witnessed night and day. It was frightening to hear the words coming from people in that restaurant. It was not only scary to wonder what was going to happen to our narrators, but mainly that people were speaking that way to fellow citizens. I know that it still occurs today, and it is surprising to me. We bomb a country because they do not follow the same principles that we do, but we need to start asking ourselves this question ... do we need another United States?

9075,5,0767805534,"I can recall the first time I saw this film.  Since I was only 6 years old in 1969 I didn't see it on it's original theatrical release.  I saw it on commercial television circa 1980 in the days before video stores and cable TV.  The movie was slotted in a two hour block and they started the film at the ""Born to be Wild"" opening credits segment.  When I saw it on video a few years later I was shocked that Fonda and Hopper made a drug deal prior to their trek to Mardi Gras.  There were other excisions, usually relating to drug use.  Why is this an important film?  Our heroes(?) aren't exactly noble individuals.  There is no real discernible plot.  The direction is haphazard at best(legend has it that director Dennis Hopper was probably stoned to the gills while making this film).  Well, this holds up as a picture of America at a time when social mores were changing.  The cinematography is beautiful.  Most impotantly, this film heralded the entrance of a new force in films, Jack Nicholson.  When Jack comes into the picture as the alcoholic ACLU lawyer the screen just lights up and maintains this aura in every scene he's in.  The scene where he smokes pot and explains the Venutian plot is classic.  The energy of this film deflates once he departs from the film.  I wonder though what relevance this picture has to a more youthful audience whose reference point to Jack is ""The Joker"".  To a younger audience Vietnam and the civil rights movement are things that may or may not have been taught in civics class.  I recommend watching this DVD (If you've seen it before) with Hopper's commentary on because it's a good one.  And the documentary on the disc isn't bad either.",1096070400,5,1688,4.511551155115511
9076,5,0767805534,"Easy Rider is definitely a movie for its period. There's no doubt that the film was a free-wheeling, pot-smoking, and other illicit drug type of movie that reflects the period that was - the counter-culture, anti-Vietnam War, and anti-establishment 1960s that came from the age of baby boomers. Peter Fonda's ""everything goes"" production was effective in producing a spontaneous film that has allowed continued analysis by scholars and anyone interested in the tumultuous period that was.

 The behind the scene commentary was interesting and insightful. Both Dennis Hopper and Fonda offered much discussion about the making of the film that reveals how difficult and how real the actors experienced what was happening in the southern part of the United States during the late '60s, which was much more intense -- bigotry and animosity towards the hippie or ""long-haired"" culture.

 The cinematography was excellent. The road scenes were just gorgeous, and the motorcycle drive through New Mexico was quite impressive. The most chilling scene was the ending with the panning out of the camera that gave a somewhat dark feeling that might depict a scene from war torn Vietnam. Or maybe a false sense of hope of a generation that fought for freedom.

 Besides the film's look, one cannot forget the soundtrack of the movie. It included a diverse selection of artists, and who can forget the Steppenwolf's overplayed Born To Be Wild, which opens the movie? Other than that, music of The Byrds, Jimi Hendrix, and Bob Dylan captured the film.

This picture, is  reflect of his own character. The tale about two renegades , every one of them trying of seeking his destiny, decide to make a journey (the mythical approach) to New Orleans Mardi Grass (evasion once more) , in his powerful motocycles .
This journey will allow Hopper to express the alienated existence of these guys and the people who surrounds in every point  they decide to rest. The violence is free ; and you watch in the visual  language of the people who simply don't accept their way of living , the way they dress ; they establish a spiritual rapport with that hippie community in the middle of the road, where the psichodelia images suggest you what's going on.
This film was a low budget . 394.000 bucks , but the script depicted as any other american film of its age the sense of going to nowhere abaout a generation tired of waiting for a change.
The increase dark shadows will cover the landscape and will carry to that magnificent and poetic ending.
I still have the original vynil soundtrack of this picture. If six was nine of Hendrix, Born to be wild and the Pusher of Steppenwolf , or the weight  were emblemeatic songs of its age which reflected wise and sincerely , the expecatations of a generation just in the year in which the man reached a superb scientific and technological triumph in Jul 29 1969 .

Produced and directed by, and starring Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda, and almost stolen by a then-unknown named Jack Nicholson playing a hippie lawyer, ""Easy Rider"" follows its two heroes across some of the most stunning scenery in the Southwest as they head towards Louisiana in search of ""freedom"", whatever that means.  ""Easy Rider"" not only brings us two (or three, counting Nicholson) of society's dropouts, we also meet a community of hippies, some narrow-minded small-town lawmen, and some rednecks in Louisiana who seem to have a more-than-passing relationship to Neanderthals.  We wonder if the film's perhaps unwitting message is that the search for meaningless ""freedom"" results in meaningless and wanton death and destruction.  More than any film of its time, ""Easy Rider"" caught the mood of the late 1960s in America and the fear of the ""establishment"" for society's rebels.

For viewers who weren't even alive during the 60s, this incredible and unforgettable film with Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper, and Jack Nicholson is an important one to watch. For those of us who can remember that era all too well, its worth a trip down memory lane.
Captain America (Fonda) and his buddy (Hopper, playing a paranoid Billy) set out on long, loud, flashy motorcycles, heading across the heartland of the US. Along the way, they pick up a drunk (Nicholson) in a small town and turn him on to, well, sex, drugs, and rock and roll.
A horrifying and all-too-plausible ending is what the movie is really about.

9094,5,0767805534,"Easy Rider is a truly landmark film in the true sense of the meaning of the term.  Produced on a very low budget and set in the late 60's it was, in my opinion, the first movie to really capture a particularly interesting moment in time.  While many films sort of used the notion of the late 60's, drugs, sex, rebellion, idealism, as a means to make money, this seemed really the first film to accurately reflect a realistic image of the time period with an unflinching eye.
Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper play Wyatt, or Captain America, and Billy, two free type spirits who, after a making quite a bit of money through a sale of drugs, decide to hit the road and drive cross country to Mardi Gras.  Along the way, they pick up George Hanson, a southern lawyer, played by Jack Nicholson.
While watching this movie, you may get a sense that it is sort of a western, with the western landscapes and the main characters riding 'iron' horses.  This was the intention of the filmmakers, especially the director, Dennis Hopper.  One of my favorite scenes was at the beginning, right before Wyatt and Billy are about to embark on their trip, Wyatt removes his watch and throws it on the ground.  This symbolized a sense of throwing off the constraints of the old world and an effort to embrace true freedom, if there is such a thing.
Nicholson tends to steal the scenes he is in, and gives a particularly wonderful piece about what freedom is, and why people are so afraid of it.  He sort of represented to me one who has been fed many misconceptions about the individuals and movement Wyatt and Billy represent, but once in their company, finds that much of what he has been told may not be true.  A sort of individual caught between the generations.
The film is dated, but that didn't detract anything for me.  The only scene I really didn't care for was when Wyatt, Billy, Mary (Toni Basil), and Karen (Karen Black) drop acid in a Louisiana cemetery and proceed to trip for an extended period of time.
Along with wonderful performances, much credit must go to the cinematographer, as the landscapes are beautiful, especially the wide shots of the western scenery.  They are truly breathtaking.  And the music used was exceptionally good, fitting each scene and helping to create the proper mood throughout the film.
The movie presented here looks excellent, in anamorphic wide screen, and includes a commentary by Dennis Hopper.  Also included is a wonderful 'Making of' featurette called Easy Rider:  Shaking the Cage which really helps to illustrate all that went into making this film.  The production, at time, often reflected the turbulent times of when the film was made, and helps to give more flavor to the movie, really enhancing the overall effect.  All in all, Easy Rider is a wonderful slice of outsider Hollywood that captured the true essence of an exceptionally turbulent time in America.",1074988800,69,2898,4.699604743083004
9095,5,0767805534,"It is as simple as this. There's nothing, really, to ""get"". This movie is about freedom and peace. It's about how the tyranny of the ""Status Quo"" stifles the spirit of man, and with bleak outcome, illustrates how this wreckless hatred of difference, and unacceptance of our fellows, ends in destruction of peace. Those with baseless pride, always quick to judge and condemn, are the real villains, despite the protagonists' lawlessness, they bring no harm to anyone, which is in stark contrast to the majority of those they encounter.
I keep reading reviews on how many ""sided with the rednecks"". All I can say is that if you find yourself doing just that, then you really must delve further into the nature of freedom. *REAL* freedom.
That is the essense of this film. It is the one word of description to label it and define it. The protagonists' are on a quest to discover what it is to be free, whilst indulging in it. The realisation of the farmer's existence is an example of where they see how freedom is manifest in different forms. Despite the choice of the expression, the farmer and the (anti)heroes share a similar viewpoint on life.
This may very well be the most patriotic film ever made. It is a shame that so many can't look past the surface to see that fact.",1074988800,11,1275,4.5964912280701755

9097,4,0767805534,"By the mid-60s, the traditional movie audience had changed from a middle-aged, high school-educated, middle-to lower-class viewing group to a younger, college-educated, more affluent, middle-class audience. This is the movie that revolutionized and redirected the industry by proving that phenomenal returns could be made from a modest investment, if it appealed to its new audience, as well as launching an interest in producing youth-cult pictures. At a glance, Easy Rider appears to be and has the charm of a cheaply made underground flick seeking to exploit the iridescent youth movement. Well it was cheaply made, as far as money goes, costing a meek $350,000, but it returned $60 million worldwide. It was the first independent film to be distributed by a major company, Columbia, and it remains one of the most vital additions to film history because it best articulated the angst and energies of this alienated mass we call the counter-culture.

Directed by Dennis Hopper, produced by Peter Fonda, and starring both as two shaggy haired, reefer-reveling vagabonds inhaling the southwestern countryside atop their motorcycles, an excursion financed by an earlier cocaine deal, the movie is fueled by a caustic, equally rebellious soundtrack. Indeed, the first half hour seems more like a continuous rock video, commenced by the ultimate road song, Steppenwolf's Born To Be Wild. They leave L.A., headed for Mardi Gras, and pass through various towns, a hippie commune, and the boundless, sun drenched American landscape, but also through areas where local residents are increasingly narrow-minded and hateful of their longhaired freedom and use of drugs. Watch as Fonda casts away his wristwatch in the beginning, a symbol of an inner escape from the constraints and complexities of modern living. The title also points to our anti-heroes' rootless natures, who's capricious decision to discover their world directs them to the road's infinite freedom.

 There's an interesting distinction to be made between Fonda's and Hopper's characters. Fonda plays the cool and introspective ""Captain America"" Wyatt astraddle a gleaming, low-riding bike with a 'stars-and-stripes' tear-drop gas tank, clad in tight leather pants and a black leather jacket with an American flag emblazoned on the back. Fonda said he actually soaked in a tub while wearing these pants, striding around in them afterwards until they had dried to give them the worn appearance. Hopper is the mustached, longhaired Billy, with a tan-colored bush hat, fringed buckskin jacket, and an Indian necklace of animals' teeth. Their names refer, of course, to the Western legends of Wyatt Earp and Billy the Kid, and this is indicative of their personalities. Wyatt is quiet, more mature, and content with any surrounding; the jive-spouting Billy is restless and easily irritated. It's easy to imagine these drifters instead as idealistic gunslingers trotting across the immortal, sun-dried West, seeking out the untarnished American Dream in a corrupt, conformist environment. A quote from the coarsely brilliant George Carlin comes to mind, who wrote ""The reason they call it the American Dream is because you have to be asleep to believe it."" As our exploration of the great civilization deepens into the bowels of the bigoted paranoia of the South, this becomes increasingly manifest.

Relish also Jack Nicholson in the performance that made him a star. After a decade or so of anonymity, he was contemplating giving acting up - lucky for him, and us, he did not. Playing the part of the jovial, rustic, and alcoholic lawyer, George Hanson, a part originally intended for Rip Torn, our hippie friends discover him in a jail after a night of obvious, though unstated, inebriation. He joins Wyatt and Billy on their quest and is bludgeoned to death one night as they camp in a forest on the outskirts of a terribly prejudiced, volatile Southern town. Think about what this represents: George, while he shares their longing for escape, is the least like Wyatt and Billy - he doesn't dress like them, doesn't speak their lingo, and doesn't have a shaggy mane. Even his addiction to alcohol seems to separate him even further from this equation - grass was a substance whose popularity belonged to the youth; alcohol was a more ancient addiction. So in him, we have a combination of both liberal and conservative values, in whose death the distinction between those dedicated to the rebellion (Wyatt and Billy) and those who're only innocent concomitants (George) diminishes. The locals are sort of killing a native son. Pay attention to what George tells Billy in campfire palaver:
  ""They're scared of what you represent to 'em (freedom)... But talkin' about it and bein' it - that's two different things. I mean, it's real hard to be free when you are bought and sold in the marketplace. 'Course, don't ever tell anybody that they're not free 'cause then they're gonna get real busy killin' and maimin' to prove to you that they are. Oh yeah, they're gonna talk to you, and talk to you, and talk to you about individual freedom, but they see a free individual, it's gonna scare 'em.""
Really, a fascinating picture. Once you get through Hopper's esoteric directorial methods and the rambling, improvisational nature of the script, I think its greater message will truly affect your viscera.",1068336000,7,5357,5.1658986175115205
9098,4,0767805534,"This is an enormously famous movie, one that has achieved iconic status.  That means it's great, right?  Well, not necessarily.  It's an incredibly amateurish and uneven flick, with gaping holes in the plot, in the dialog, in the editing.  The performances are (quite literally) stoned and dazed.  But in this birds nest of oddness there are enough true gems to put it firmly in the forefront of classic cinema.  These are the scenes we've all seen before: the famous ""This used to be a hell of a good country"" scene at the campfire comes to mind.  That soliloquy alone is worth the price of the DVD.  I think it all boils down to the fact that there is basically nothing worth getting too sentimental about from this time period.  The crazy crack pot adolescence of the American nation doesn't bear too much scrutiny or it becomes painfully obvious that if you weren't stoned, you didn't get it, and you won't get it now.  In other words, you have to believe it to see it.  I do believe some of it, sometimes, and this movie helps me glimpse that small part.  But it also shows me how painfully vaccuous and dreary and empty and pointless so much of the youth counterculture truly was.
 Any way, good flick, and it rings with an historical authenticity that is almost unequaled.  Its great contribution is that it was made at the peak of the era, and commented on that era very eloquently.  Usually the good commentary doesn't come along for many years, but Easy Rider pretty much hits the nail on the head.  Plus the bikes are great.
 I highly recommend a very similar film called ""Vanishing Point"", which is a better film, and another dose of very authentic and high-proof 60's/70's nihilism.  It ends just as happily, too.",1067644800,6,1726,4.60327868852459

The progeny of the folks who won World War II, these young boomer-drifters were aimless and lazy; the film opens with two of these bums equipping themselves with money via an illegal heroin deal (trashing, no doubt, the lives of the drug users and their families, not to mention the folks they had to rip off in order to fund their addictions).  We then watch this pair, one a sedated pot-head and the other a lunatic pot-head, drift toward New Orleans for a big drunk party, picking up along the way another equally purposeless bum (the great Jack, in a stunning role!).  The plot plays out in an appropriate fashion for people who live their lives in this repulsive manner.

9120,5,0767805534,"An uncomplicated film for complicated times; Easy Rider is the road movie to end all road movies. The plot is simple enough, 2 hippies (Fonda and Hopper) make one big score dealing cocaine, buy 2 fat hogs and saddle up to ride down to Mardi Gras. Well, along the way the boys encounter friends and enemies (mostly the latter) until they end up in jail for parading without a permit! Enter Nicholson...Jack plays a drunk ACLU lawyer named George who comes from a priviledged background. But, he can relate to these longhairs and in fact has more than a little in common with their world view. I don't want to give away any more of the plot as you must watch to be shocked, but let's just say it doesn't end pretty. Peter Fonda's Captain America character is a pure optimist and the embodiment of what America used to be. He is accepting, caring and fiercely original. Fonda turns in a strong understated performance. Hopper's character is more of the stereotypical hippie, complete with paranoid rants and goofy behavior. He's definitely not the straight man here and his performance is too over the top. Nicholson steals the show even for the brief amount of time he's actually in the film...a truly great performance. Easy Rider shares a commonality with Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas in fact the two plots are basically interchangable: 2 friends set out in search of America and couldn't find it anywhere. There are a few problem's like the acid trip scene which is ridiculously overdone and the ending which paints an overly pessimistic America to come. But, in the end there's no denying the simple genius here. The landscapes are breathtaking and so is the soundtrack (The Band, Grateful Dead, Hendrix, etc.). This is one trip you must take.

Over the years it has come to be considered as the spearhead of ""form without content"" cinema. Having seen it again since it's initial release, it is something of an embarassment and little more than a misguided curio and observation of a social movement as seen from a comfortable disengagued distance (no matter what people say about Corman, he was still in the business of selling tickets and this was just as much exploitation as ""Riot On Sunset Strip"" was a year or two earlier). Not just for the false notes it hits and stereotypes it depicts, it revels in its own smugness and conceit making, at least for this ageing hippy, a very uncomfortable experience. Sadly, this movie will be judged by many as ""the way it was"" and it will become something of a reference point for viewers and film makers who were not alive during this period to point to as a touchstone of accuracy.

Those of us who grew up in the late '60s are aware of Henry David Thoreau's comment that, ""The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation."" Well, Captain America (whose real name in the movie was Wyatt) and Billy didn't. They did it their way. Yeah, they ultimately paid the ultimate price (I assume everyone knows how it ends by NOW...), but man, oh, man did they have fun along the way. Jack Nicholson's role made him a star after he'd struggled through minor roles in movies like ""Angels Die Hard"" and ""Mister Roberts"" (or was it ""Ensign Pulver""?). The big debate among those of us back in the day was, should they have stayed at the commune or should they have moved on? I always voted for moving on and then returning to the commune. (Yeah, OK, some aspects of this movie are very, very dated...) And the other was, who did WE want to be, the cool Captain America or the antic, frantic Billy (the Kid...). (If you didn't catch it early, get the names: Wyatt (Earp) and Billy (the Kid)... Yeah, it's a cliche, but it was fun anyway.)

Reviewer: A viewer from Minneapolis, Minnesota United States
The scenery alone is enough to send chills down your spine. Add to that the killer soundtrack and Jack Nicholson's star making (and in my opinion, his best) performance and you've got yourself one hell of a film. Easy Rider (Directed by Dennis Hopper) is the story of two hippie bikers who take a trip on their motorcycles down to the Mardi-Gras festival in New Orleans. Along the way they stopped at a hippie commune, end up in a parade, and spend the night in jail before finally making it to Mardi-Gras. Where they proceed to have themselves a good old time ...
The big three things that make this movie special are the scenery (photographed to perfection, by Laslo Kovack) the music. Which just plain rocks and Jack Nicholson's performance. Nothing against Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper's performance but Nicholson steals every scene he's in. This movie is also a fasinating look at the 60's counterculture. Lots of ... great music, killer movie. Enjoy.",1034985600,3,1059,4.888888888888889

A  philosophical/psychadelic script (nominated for an academy award) describes precisely a unique part of modern society with nothing on their mind, but aspiration for creating a better future. Whether they are right or wrong, the film is an interesting document about America at the time of crisis, and the wishes of man to be released from cables of time and age.",1033257600,2,482,4.878048780487805

there shattered to see a whole new perspective of this movie.
In 1991 I was in the USA for two months. During that period I rode a Haley-Davidson through the States for five weeks and as I said at the Virginia State HOG Rally, 'When I saw the movie Easy Rider for the first time ""One day I'm going to go to the States and ride a Harley"" and I am doing it now'I will keep watching this movie and also listen to the great music which is part of the history of my generation.

9142,5,0767805534,"Most of the negative reviews here criticise this movie as being dated and for idolising the waster culture - possibly related criticisms - but it's difficult to see how you could justify either except on a very cursory consideration of the film.
Easy Rider absolutely refuses to idolise the sixties ideal, and it is not to my eyes even vaguely dated (I say this having seen it for the first time last night, thirty three years late).
The golden thread running through this film is that THE PARTY'S OVER, DUDES.
Fonda states this explicitly (""we blew it..."") and it's firmly implied in a devastatingly funny caricature of a dead beat hippy commune (as the city dropouts joyously commune with nature, scattering their seed on the barren land of the New Mexico desert, Fonda asks wryly, ""do you, ah, get much rain up here?"")
And (without wishing to spoil the ending) by the time the credits roll, our heroes haven't exactly profited from their wild lives. The ending of the film is profoundly pessimistic about the prospects for freedom and independence.
The film is certainly critical of the intolerant ""establishment"" (which nevertheless prevails), but if there is one character who does smell of roses, it is the farmer who takes the boys in for the night and who, says Fonda, should be proud simply for living off the land.
For my money this makes Easy Rider ahead, rather than behind its times. It's also rooted in a number of great cinematic traditions, aside from the Road Movie genre which it helped to invent. I like the idea (expressed in a review below) that this is a latter day western, even down to the character's names, Wyatt and Billy. Also, were you to draw a line between Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid and Thelma & Louise, it would intersect Easy Rider.
The performances of the cast are delightful - Nicholson's is rightly feted, and Hopper's is very Dennis Hopper - fans of Apocalypse Now will recognise this style in which Hopper doesn't really act so much as simply looning around - here in total contrast to Fonda's studied coolness, which holds the film together, reinforced with a cracking soundtrack (in this regard also, Easy Rider was well ahead of its time).
If you fancy a dash of counterpoint, try watching Easy Rider back to back with David Lynch's stunning recent work The Straight Story - as a compare and contrast job, I think they'd make a fascinating study.",1024790400,13,2394,4.743405275779376

9146,4,0767805534,"There really isn't any big mystery as to why EASY RIDER was such a massive hit when it was released in 1969.  On a budget of no more than half a million dollars, the director/producer team of Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda somehow captured the alienation that a lot of young people felt about America during that turbulent time.
Hopper and Fonda are, respectively, Billy and Wyatt, two Harley Davidson-riding hippie bikers who, after making a big drug score with a big-time dope dealer (played by record mogul Phil Spector), embark on a journey across America, ostensibly to enjoy a good time in New Orleans during Mardi Gras.  Along the way, they encounter, initially, the more idealistic side of America in a New Mexico hippie commune and a farm in Arizona.  But when they get into Texas, their joining a parade illegally gets them tossed into a redneck jail.  Not long after, though, they are bailed out by a very inebriated lawyer by the name of George Hanson (Jack Nicholson, in the role that made him a household word in Hollywood).
Nicholson cheerfully agrees to go along with them on their Harley sojourn.  Along the way, Hopper complains to him about how he and Fonda are constantly harrassed by the law and unable to get even a ""second rate motel"" to sleep in.  Nicholson gingerly explains to the pair that it's not just the length of the hair that bothers people; it's what they represent--individual freedom: ""They'll talk to you and talk to you about freedom, but when they see someone with real freedom, it's gonna scare them.""  One night, Louisiana rednecks savagely beat and kill Nicholson.  It is at this point that EASY RIDER starts getting bleaker in tone.
Fonda and Hopper arrive in New Orleans at the height of Mardi Gras, and cavort around an Orleans cemetary with two hookers (Toni Basil, Karen Black) during an acid trip.  But dismayed by what they've seen, they beat a hasty retreat and continue east.  Fonda realizes the futility of their journey now.  He tells Hopper, ""We blew it.""  Their journey comes to an end on a Florida highway when Hopper flicks off two rednecks in a truck, who then proceed to blow both him and Fonda off the road.
Unquestionably dated to a large extent, particularly in the strange editing of certain sequences and the acid trip, which looks less avant garde and more amateurish, EASY RIDER nevertheless has its merits.  The soundtrack is one of those merits, with 1960s classics like Steppenwolf's ""Born To Be Wild"" and the Band's ""The Weight"", and countryish tracks like ""Wasn't Born To Follow"" (the Byrds) and ""Don't Bogart Me"" (Fraternity of Man).  The other is, of course, Nicholson's star-making performance as George Hanson.  Before this, Nicholson was just a B-grade actor.  But his often-uproarious and, later, thoughtful performance here cemented his reputation as a top-notch movie star forever.
Featuring very fine cinematography by Laszlo Kovacs, who later went on to do portions of CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, EASY RIDER is a flawed film by today's standards, but in its day was a groundbreaking film that helped change Hollywood forever.  If one can get by its being highly dated, it still works as a period piece.",1019174400,4,3190,4.834558823529412

""A classic...a great film for its day...everyone is sure to love it"", those were the comments I had been hearing about Easy Rider before I rented it. I expected this movie to be great because it was called a counterculture classic and topped many people's lists of the best film of the 1960's. In my opinion, Easy Rider is a case of don't believe everything you read.
Sure, the movie has its good points. The music is fantastic. The songs are all very memorable and suit the road theme, styles of the film and the time in which it is set very well. Many of the songs of the movie have become classics since the films release. Easy Rider is also shot gorgeously, with heaps of great sunset shots and motorcycle journeys.
The performances in the movie are also very good. Jack Nicholson is the stand out as the innocent comic relief Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda meet when they go to jail. Nicholson deserved another Oscar for this role! Hopper clearly put a lot of effort into the film being a writer, director and lead actor, but his continuous ""man's"" and hippie references annoyed the heck out of me, as did his monologues about what he ""sees"" after he takes drugs. Peter Fonda was hailed as the leading actor of the movie but he really doesn't say that much and he has very little facial expression. His acting definitely got better.
There was also way too many drugs in this movie. In the film, this is basically the story: these 2 guys take drugs, encounter people, take drugs, make the people they encounter take drugs, take some drugs, sleep, take a couple more drugs, have sex, and then take drugs. And apparently this story is all about ""freedom"" according to Dennis Hopper. Yeah right. Also, Easy Rider doesn't present any ideas why or why not the characters should be doing this. Why are they doing it in the first place? Is taking drugs a way to make people free and express freedom? No. I found the use of drugs both pointless and excruciatingly unrealistic in this film.
So, the movie does have its good points - the cinematography, bikes and Jack Nicholson - but not enough to overcome the whole pointlessness of the entire production. This is one big disappointment for me, and I can't believe such a film that was hailed as a ""classic"" could be so banal and stupid.

The main idea of the film is freedom.  Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper take a motorcyle trip across the USA while heading for Mardi Gras.  Although this is the destination, Peter Fonda (is looking for something.  This something could be America, but you feel it is more profound than that.  You receive hints from the things he says to others.
For instance, he and Hopper have stopped at a farm to fix one of the bikes and to eat.  After talking with the farmer, Captain USA comments about how great it is to be here on the land doing your own thing.
Jack Nicholson has the best lines of the movie when he explains that we love to talk about freedom, but we are scared to death of people who actually live it.  A very important idea considering the war that was going on at the time of this movie.

ORIGINAL REVIEW 2002:

My dad rented this movie because we somehow stumbled upon talking about this movie when discussing war, well that's only logical I guess given the context of this film.

 I love this movie. It has truly sad moments, and many powerful scenes, this film is a time capsule in the best way possible, given a good state of hippie culture at the tie this film was released, and should be mandatory viewing along with ""Woodstock"" to give a broad picture of those turbulent times. This was the first movie to EVER to rock(I mean rock, not rock'n roll, which truly are two separate types of music) music in it  as the soundtrack. This is a landmark film, it has major killer tunes from The Byrds, Steppen Wolf, Jimmy Hendrix, and many others.

All I know is that if you are looking to learn a little more about the way the 60's were for hippies look no further then here, it couldn't be further from the truth...My dad talks so much, I learned a lot about the 1960's, even if I didn't live the 60's. Its definitely worth one watch at least. Not for young kids for sure, has nudity, quite a bit(we are talking about a hippy movie here), heavy drug use, and profuse violence. A great example of a well-made independent film. Just check it out, forget if it looks old WHO CARES?

When you look at this movie it seems really simple so why was it so successful? Well I can only say in my opinion that this movie had to be made in 1969 to be successful. If it was made today it just would not be the same.
That is what makes EASY RIDER so special. The fact that it is the ultimate sixties experience.

Not surprisingly, his portrayal of ""Billy"", the frantic companion to Peter Fonda's ""Wyatt"" is the constantly racing heart of Easy Rider, one of the most important films of the late sixties.
Filmed the year after the summer of love had ended, Rider is one of the few true portraits of the cultural landscape of that turbulent era. The mellow Fonda always represents a generations quest for a simple kind of peace while Hopper, who also directed, is the fatal drive towards a futile end, always pulling away from the obvious path. They ride their custom choppers like two cowboys headed through the wild west. It's an obvious analogy but a meaningful one, their dangers were no less great as we find out. Although a notoriously frazzled production, great performances (notably Jack Nicholson), and a supurb use of some of the great rock road anthems of the day help create something fascinating, if quite dated. Of course, whether you lived the era or not, today the movie stands as a great historical representation of the mood of a country during one of America's strangest periods. Hopper's direction seems subdued by contrast to his performance (outside of a depressing and sureal trip and acid trip through Mardi Gras and a rather blunt ending) although perhaps less so considering his admitted, much longer initial cut, before leveler heads prevailed. There is an obvious fly by night amateurish quality overall but It's still a good film, maybe even great in certain ways. Cultural sign posts like this are rare.

Now I am fascinated by it, and its controvery is far more apparent to me. My best recomendation to anyone who is going to see this for the first time and did not live in the 60s is to learn more about the time period first. That way, when you see Henry Fonda stuffing money into his gas tank so he can buy drugs on his road trip, you will realize that the mainstream reaction was ""Oh my lord, how can someone do such a thing, like actually plan out that they know that they will want drugs in the near future."" And there is even more to that shot besides what I have tried to articulate. So there is no sure fire way to explain this movie to anyone too young to remember when it first came out. However, if one makes the effort (and not an extreme one is needed) the times and feelings of the 60s can become intelligible.

There had other hippie movies before, but they were mostly bad films about drug use.  Easy Rider tells the story of two hippies, played by Dennis Hopper & Peter Fonda, who motorcycle across the country from California to New Orleans for Mardi Gras.  They had just made a big drug score and are using that money for the trip.  Along the way, they stay at a commune in the desert, get caught up in a dispute in a small town and of course take alot of drugs.

The film is visually pretty and well shot and they make great use of rock songs as no other movie had beforehand. The film was also a commentary by hippies about hippies.  It is supposed to show that hippies are just peace loving people who embody the freedom America is supposed to give people.  They are unfairly persecuted by small-minded people who judge them by the length of their hair.  At the time, this was all groundbreaking stuff.  The problem is that the film hasn't aged well in the 30 years since it's release.  It is still cemented back in 1969 and now is just a relic from that time.  The film's power should be more judged for the doors it opened up for other maverick film makers like Martin Scorcese, Peter Bogdanovich and other later ones like Quentin Tarantino and Spike Lee.

Different themes in the film - freedom, prejudice, community, and hypocrisy - are tossed around aimlessly, with no sense of cohesion, making the viewer wonder just what the film's point is (when he isn't yawning).  A classic it may be to some viewers, but to this one it is just a giant snooze.",975888000,18,686,4.581967213114754

As for Jack, I think his character is the worst. That bad accent stunk compared to the believable characters of Fonda and Hopper. Forget your politics in this. Forget what you think of drugs. This is about bigotry and hatred. ""Normal people see freedom and it makes them scared."" ""It don't make them runnin' scared."" It speaks to any generations disaffected youth.

9193,2,0767805534,"This is considered the classic 60's counterculture film. Released in 1969, the American Film Institute (AFI) ranks it the 88th best film ever made,  Time Magazine called it ""...one of the ten most important pictures of  the decade,"" and the LA Times said it remains ""...an astonishing  work of art and an overpowering motion picture experience."" It is the  movie that  rocketed Jack Nicholson to stardom. All that said, it has not  aged well!
The plot is; Let's buy drugs, then sell the drugs and use the  money to go to Mardi Gras on our motorcycles. Along the way, we'll stop at  a hippy commune, we'll have small-town girls sitting in a soda parlor think  we're cute and we'll have sex with prostitutes in a New Orleans house of  ill repute. All individuals in 'straight society' (in that term's original  sense) are portrayed as cretins.
No storyline, no character development,  no nuance, no maturation or lessons learned by the characters. No tension,  either based on time running out or options running out. Only obvious  metaphors, the editing doesn't come close to meeting the standards of the  time, there's no backstory, no flashbacks, no richness, no depth, NO  WAY.
I am writing this review because I was gullible enough to BUY this  movie on DVD, based on the AFI ranking and my eagerness to accept it as the  de facto standard drug culture movie of the sixties. I erred. There are  only two redeeming elements in this film. One is great Rock music from,  among others, Jimi Hendrixx and the Byrds. The other is Jack Nicholson, who  has the role of  a factoid spouting young, alcoholic lawyer. In effect, he  is playing himself and he does so magnificently. But, in spite of this  performance, the rest of variables that constitute a good movie or a good  story are either missing or  misused. Miss it!",967939200,15,1817,4.725239616613418

True, it launched the  careers of Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper, and Jack Nicholson.  It featured  some of the best rock music of the time in the soundtrack. The  cinematography is wonderful as well.  So what's the problem?  Well for one  thing the characters are not developed well at all.  By the film's end I  knew little more about them than I did when I started.  It was also fairly  boring too.  It did not move fast at all.  But it is worth a watch if you  want to see some great actors before they hit their prime.

9196,5,0767805534,"The VHS version does not do justice for hopper/fonda's masterpiece work.  DVD all the way.  I couldn't believe how 'new' it looked when i saw it for the first time on widescreen/dvd.  This was always a favorite flick of  mine.  It is a classic.  Yer basic story of 'drug-dealin' buddies, sell  their stuff, make money, get bigger bikes and go cross country on two  Harley's during the era of ""Beautify America"", a time of  revolution and peace, love rock and roll.  Rock and roll: Easy Rider has  one of THE best soundtracks as well; Steppenwolf's ""The Pusher""  and ""Born to Be Wild"" fit the scenes QUITE well.  The Byrd's  ""I wasn't born to follow"", The Band's  ""The Weight"" and  Jimi's ""If Six Was Nine"" made their marks in history by their  musical impact in this film.  Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper portray Wyatt  (Capt. America) and Billy (the Kid) in this biker/western cult classic.  ""Gotta get to Mardi Gras, man!"".  Luke Askew plays an awesome  hippie/guru head of a hippie haven located in the middle of the desert.  Jack Nicholson ""George Hanson/Blum-blum-blum-tang!"" plays a 'well  educated' lawyer tryin' to get outta jail....it all flows together so well.  The movie starts off with Wyatt and Billy snorting cocaine, then they  smoke grass then they drink wine/liquor and then they trip in the gravest  of places...a graveyard with two 'whores' from that house mentioned in that  Animals song.  After the first time I saw this film, i was inspired to go  out and make my own...I may do so, someday.  I think what makes this a  classic flick, the fact that when it was released we had wars going on in  Vietnam and at home in the US of A, between protestors and government.  This flick avoids government and Vietnam war, just the war between mellow  peace bikers against an irrate southern USA culture.....but it goes for the  sex, drugs, rock and roll....cornerstone of any nutrious-best movie of all  time.....This dvd version also features the making of the film which is  interesting to listen to Dennis, Pete, Luke and other writers and crew  about the troubles that made Easy Rider the classic that it is.....",964656000,8,2129,4.760330578512397

It states almost exactly what the youth of  that period was trying to relate to society. That true freedom starts with  accepting yourself & other people for who you or they are.  This is  one of them must-watch movies. Both Peter Fonda & Dennis Hopper did a  great job in this movie.  I recommend this movie alot.,959731200,5,484,4.431818181818182
9198,4,0767805534,"When ""Easy Rider"" was released in 1969, it marked a turning point in the history of the American cinema. It took the independent film movement--practiced for so long by Roger Corman and others--and thrust it forward into the spotlight and, eventually, the mainstream. Made for under a million dollars, ""Easy Rider"" eventually grossed close to fifty, and opened Hollywood's eyes to a whole new area of potential profits. The American film was never to be the same again.
The story is a simple one: two hippies (Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper) riding their motorcycles cross-country to New Orleans for Mardi Gras. Along the way they visit a commune, meet some girls, go to a whorehouse, and do lots and lots of drugs. They also get thrown in jail where they meet an alcoholic lawyer, terrifically played by Jack Nicholson in his breakthrough role. The trio then continues on together towards New Orleans, stopping occasionally to smoke some grass and philosophize about life. Eventually, they have a series of strange and violent conflicts with some rednecks that lead to the movie's rather abrupt conclusion.
The best aspects of the film are the on-target performances and Laszlo Kovacs' stark cinematography. Also of note is a stunning, hallucinatory montage of an acid trip, complete with a bizarre Catholic motif. The writing (by Fonda, Hopper, and Terry Southern) is strictly ordinary, providing only the barest structure to hang the story on, punctuated by mostly improvised dialog.
What made ""Easy Rider"" different from the ordinary Hollywood films of its time was its rebellious spirit and youthful exuberance, complemented by its loud hippie rock soundtrack. Directed by Hopper and produced by Fonda, ""Easy Rider"" was the first movie of its kind to reach such a wide audience and gain mainstream acceptance. Its casual portrayal of drug use and confrontational defiance of authority combined to make ""Easy Rider"" an anthem for young people. Although the film today seems inevitably dated, it still stands as an enduring emblem of its age.",959040000,5,2044,5.141141141141141

Granted, the film is a little outdated.  But one needs to see it as more of a time capsule of a lost era than  ""some sixties movie."" As for the DVD, the Steppenwolf soundtrack  never sounded better. And I enjoyed the audio commentary also, but that  could be because I like Dennis Hopper.

This film is so bad that I can't  even think of four other films to insult by including them in the same  list.

9211,5,0767805534,'Easy Rider' is a film which encaptures the 60s brilliantly. It is a film about people and about achieving the ultimate goal complete satisfaction and freedom- which as we find out during our journey with Hopper and Fonda  cannot be achieved. The film is a journey across America where the viewer  learns about people from all different walks of life through the eye's of  the main character. The film is shot magnificently and makes the world seem  unreal at times. Which paradoxically makes them feel they are experiencing  something more real than they could ever have imagined.

It'll get you that hippy vibe (the flower powery dope and love one, not the beat freight hopping whisky drinkin Kerouac one!). It's a film you have to see  to grasp modern American culture. It shows you some of what the hippies  thought they were doing, and some of what the rest of the world thought. It  may even encourage you to throw away your watch and swim naked in a  mountain pool. But it will surely give you a good evening in front of the  TV and a good feeling. Except that last scene - that's a bummer, man.",953078400,2,582,4.207207207207207
9213,2,0767805534,"Easy Rider is a legendary movie. This ofcourse is due to its cultural and box office impact rather then the quality of the film itself. Today the film is merely a curio-item, but as a film, it just doesn't work. Witness  for example the ludicrous dialogue, when a farmer invites Fonda and Hopper  to eat with his family, there is a close-up of Fonda's face as he says  ""Its great thing for a man to live off the land, you should be  proud."" Please, this sounds like a public service commercial for some  farmers union. Hopper as a director has this highly annoying gimmick of  falshing frames of the next scene twice before actually moving onto it, and  he doesn't do it once but throughout the film. Now I'm aware that this  gimmickry might have been revolutionary back in the sixties, but now it  only breaks the flow of a film that is already hard to sit through. The  movie consists of endless shots of Fonda and Hopper on their bike, and not  much else, but it does however recieve a major jolt with Jack Nicholson's  arrival, he briefly awakens this movie out of its slumber. Unfortunatly  he's not on for long, and we're back to Fonda and Hopper on bikes. The  movie then ends in an extended acid trip which despite being completely  pointless is far more entertaining then the rest of this tepid film. Watch  this if you're a serious film buff and want to know what the hoopla is  about, but once you've gotten through it once, I doubt you'll have it in  you to sit through it again.",952646400,8,1491,4.419117647058823
9214,3,0767805534,"OK.  To me, it is a classic, but that is in my world as it is in many others.
This film satisfied a void in the cinema of its time that was very underserved.  If you are very thirsty, the worst beer will be very  welcome.  In that way, Easy Rider offered some groovy music (the subset  which was made available for the soundtrack), drug themes, trite  counterculture, ...  And they didn't use sexual themes really at all to  sell it.
The characters, notably Hopper's, are thoroughly unlikable and I  find it funny how many people align with the film but would have to force  any real identification with the lead characters.
Fonda's ""we blew  it"" summation near the end hits on a variety of levels: their  filmmaking, the disillusioned culture that closed the 60s, as well as the  obvious plot direction.  The editing is abyssmal.  But there is a certain  charm in it all.  Waywardly adrift bastards of the generation (or any  generation) are portrayed as unsympathetic and directionless in a very  genuine and probably artistically accidental way in concert with the same  production qualities of the film.
I do still like to watch this one  periodically.  It brings back memories.  Unlike what some may assert, this  film doesn't reveal the 60s or 60s culture in any breadth.  As a longhair  of the times, I can say that it does remind that being a longhair at the  time wasn't so hip to most people.
Also, Phil Spector as the connection  at the beginning is a bizarre (in a good way) touch.
I think just about  anyone should see this movie.  Make up your own minds.  But take off the  rose-coloured glasses first.",951091200,10,1616,4.6007067137809186

This film is cinematically stunning,  backed by a superb soundtrack and top-notch cast (Jack Nicholson's first  major role).
