hell, and the U.S. does not always get it right,

mistakes of other countries. I watched the

3516738,5,B001CR499I,"This documentary looks at the violence of the 20th Century in new light. Harvard historian Niall Ferguson takes a comprehensive look at the totality of conflict from the turn of the century, up through to the end of the Cold War and turns some of the conventional wisdom on its head. Great powers did not just wage war in the two World Wars, but engaged in various hostilities throughout the century, which in hindsight, looks more like a global 100-years war. Economic volatility, ethnic disintegration, and empires in decline were the root causes of these many pitiful wars that persisted in what was otherwise a century of unprecedented human progress. Moreover, the disruptions to the distribution of global power favored the rise of the East, more so than the West, in what turned out to be a 'tainted victory' for the allies at the end of WWII. The ""Third World's War"" was the ultimate result, as dueling superpowers waged war by proxy in undeveloped nations. These key points make this truly one of the most compelling documentaries ever presented, covering the two World Wars and the events that link them -- definitely a must see for anyone seriously interested in the history of warfare.",1245628800,57,1197,4.872549019607843

3516742,4,B001CR499I,"Based on noted historian and commentator Niall Ferguson's book this series on PBS is quite enlightening and fascinating. It breaks apart our preconceived notions about the violent 20th Century, its many conflicts and root causes. How humans treated their earthly enemies as ""aliens"" or ""subhumans"" and drawing parallels with the prescient ""The War of the Worlds"" novel by H.G. Wells. As Niall explains the extreme violence of the 20th century can be explained by ethnic conflict, economic volatility and empires in decline.

3516783,1,B001CR499I,"This review is for ""The War of the World"" DVD. It has three segments, about 60 minutes each.

I was disappointed by this DVD. Other reviews saying ""must see"" and ""should be required viewing in every high school"" are nonsense, IMO. This DVD is a gross oversimplification and misrepresentation of 20th century history, and poorly produced. I think students would be poorly served by watching this DVD.

A main thesis is that the 20th century was a ""single, unrelenting war of the world"", that there was a ""global hundred years war"". That's nonsense. How can the Japanese Russian War, WWI, WWII, Vietnam, Cambodian genocide, Bosnian war and various other conflicts shown all be part of the same war? They are not. Obviously, there is some relation between the wars, and some of the countries are the same, but the reality is much more complex.

The DVD takes a well-established truth, that WWI and WWII were closely related, and tries to turn it into an over-arching notion of the 20th century as a ""global 100 years war"" that falls flat on it's face.

As indicated by the title and spelled out repeatedly, the DVD asserts that 20th century wars played out the scenario of HG Wells' ""War of the Worlds"", except that the ""Martians"" were humans. This is an incredible stretch. The heat beam is quite different from the flame thrower. HG Wells did NOT predict tanks, as the DVD visuals imply. The Martians invaded because their world was dying, not because of racial differences. I could go on, but the comparison of the 20th Century history with the HG Wells book is just silly, a kind of marketing ploy. And the author misses the only real comparison that I note, the gas attacks of WWI, which for some reason are never mentioned.

The author suggests that maybe the ""good guys"" did not win in WWII, that maybe Hitler and Stalin were not so bad. Later, at the end, he pretty much contradicts himself on this and admits how terrible their actions were.

The production is often irritating. There are modern sequences of 1) Russian navel cadets marching along, 2) Japanese soldiers saluting, and 3) the engineer of the Trans-Siberian Railway, and 4) rapidly shifting photos of different ""races"" (but none black) that are repeatedly shown, with jarring music, as if to signify something. But it doesn't signify anything, it's just filler, along with long sequences of Ferguson riding around on subways, walking through a night market to the bemusement of bystanders, or walking around other various sites. There is a relative shortage of historical footage.

The DVD makes a big deal of Leon Trotsky's Jewish background being a primary reason the 1905 Russian Revolution failed, that people lost faith in the revolution because Trotsky was Jewish. That is very questionable, the real history is much more complex.

The DVD plays fast and loose with the words ""East"" and ""West"", as part of it's thesis that the 20th Century was not the triumph of the west, but instead the resurgence of the east. In one part, the east is Japan, I'm OK with that. But in another part, the ""fault line"" between east and west supposedly lies in the Balkans. Then again Russia is the west and Siberia the east. But Russia is east of the Balkans. And are we to consider Germany part of the ""East"", as it was on the ""wrong side"" of both world wars? And is the USSR part of the east or west? It's all mixed up. Meanwhile, the images of various ""races"" flash by on the screen as a kind of enigmatic filler.

Supposedly, in WWII the reason the Japanese soldiers rarely if ever surrendered was that they knew American soldiers did not take prisoners, that the fight to the death was a reaction to widespread American atrocities. Certainly American soldiers committed atrocities, but I think almost all historians agree (and the facts indicate) it was the other way around, that fighting to the death was a requirement of Japanese soldiers in their training, that the Japanese committed many more atrocities, Japanese soldiers did not respect American soldiers that surrendered, and that the American soldiers figured out that Japanese soldiers did not surrender. The DVD is just flat wrong.

Many basic facts are necessarily omitted from a three hour DVD (eg, American entry into WWI, trench warfare, military collapse on eastern front in WWI, D-day, countless others) that unrealistically purports to be a ""History of the 20th Century"". On the other hand, some events such as the battle of Kursk and the assassination of Franz Ferdinand get a lot of time, though with not really that much insight derived. For example, it is suggested that Kursk, not Stalingrad, was the turning point of WWII, but that is debatable.

There is a paucity of maps. And one of the few maps used, that of Japanese expansion, is shown at the wrong time in the DVD, shows Japan invading the Phillipines in the 1930s. The exact same map is shown later, when Japan actually did invade.

The DVD says that the main cause of the wars in the 20th Century was not class differences, but race and ethnic differences. The reality about the origin of wars is more complex. I don't know the exact answers, but it's certainly not the gross oversimplifications presented in this DVD. The DVD even contradicts itself when it notes that Germany and Britain shared so many racial and class characteristics. This doesn't fit the thesis, but just gets glossed over.

The DVD asks the question why the German people fell in love with Hitler, while the US recovered from the Great Depression, did not descend into tyranny. It comes to the conclusion that it was because ""Germany produced Hitler and the US system produced FDR"". That doesn't explain anything, is just a silly one-liner.

The DVD says there was a ""third world war"", basically proxy wars between the west and communist countries. Certainly, there were proxy wars, but there was no WW III - this is just a misleading literary device used by the DVD. Again, the reality is more complex. There was not a single ""World War III"".

The DVD says of WWII that ""appeasement did not lead to war, but war led to appeasement"". That is ridiculous. This is just a provocative one-liner, and goes against the known facts.

At the end, the DVD very briefly shows an ambiguous image, perhaps of a Muslim, with the suggestion about a possible start of ""World War 4"". It's so brief and vague as to be meaningless. No matter what happens, the DVD can say ""we told you so"".

Obviously, there are some good things in this three hour DVD. Certainly the message that war is horrible and that the 20th century was very violent is worth pointing out. Certainly race is an important cause of conflict, and the enemy is demonized in war. Certainly millions died that we hardly hear about. Certainly every country has had it's share of atrocities, and a ""civilized"" country like Germany can commit some of the worst. But none of this is novel, and I think it gets lost in the inaccuracies and over-simplification.

My guess is the DVD is intentionally provocative. This is perhaps a way for Niall Ferguson to get popularity. But I think it should be shunned as factually incorrect. There are many other more factual DVD histories of 20th century wars, with better production values, and with less of the musings of one individual.",1391904000,5,7290,4.767644726407613

3516788,1,B001CR499I,"The tidal wave of war, barbarism and anti-western sentiment is again rising in the East, accrding to Ferguson's popular-genre film ""The War of the World"". What's worse, it is apparently already here -- in the heart of Vienna, Paris, and London! The final moments of the film, which depicted a group of young ""oriental-looking"" women clad in Islamic scarves with a backdrop of London's double-decker buses were particularly poignant. A picture is worth a thousand words.

In the old days, Dr. Ferguson reminds us, the ""Fault Lines"" separating the West from the rest were in the God-forsaken semi-oriental places like Sarajevo. But today, he claims, these ""fault lines"" run through every Western city. Chose your side, he implies. Are you, viewer, on the side of the Western Civilization?

Dr. Ferguson spent quite a bit of time in my native Russia making this film, digging for an interesting (and chilling) footage and stories, even taking the Trans-Siberian railroad voyage. The footage is good at times. But his point is that the barbaric and ""Asiatic"" Russians are culpable of starting wars, looks to me very much like demonizing. We all need to stem the tide coming from the East, he implies, to save the Western Civilization from the assault of the ""Non-West"".

The Serbians didn't fare much better - apparently, they started World War One by assassinating Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo on 28 June 1914 in an act ""state-sponsored terrorism"", as he calls it. (The real culprit, the Austro-Hungarian Empire who decided to teach Slavs a lesson even though they didn't possess proof that the Serbian State was involved in the plot, has been exonerated by Ferguson)

I didn't expect a well-known figure like Dr. Ferguson to become such an implausible cineaste of the pathetic ""Clash of Civilizations"". What a strange thing. Did he forget that the West's ""civilizational"" mission was mixed at best and often dismal?  Did he forget that the Nazism was an illegitimate child, but a child of the ""Western Civilization"" nevertheless? What about Communism? With straight face he tells his viewers that the ""large forces"" like the decaying empires, economic dislocation and ethnic hatred cause wars. That's a very implausible theory. I argue that these forces don't cause wars; they only increase the international anarchy, which in turn make wars more possible.

An important link in his logic seems to be missing. I cannot agree with him that the ""large"" impersonal forces start wars. The Great Powers start great wars, specifically -- the Great Britain, Russia, Germany, the US, Japan. They do it, because they rationally choose War. They think that wars advance their political goals, power and prestige. The Great Powers ""think"" like Clausewitz -- ""war is continuation of politics by other means"". Incidentally, no Great Power started wars more frequently than the British Empire. Dr. Ferguson was discreet on this topic, no doubt because the Britons were frequently ""goodies"", at least according to the prevailing version of historical discourse. But it's worth remembering that the Great Britain, rightly or wrongly, chose to declare war on Germany on August 4, 1914 and again on September 3, 1939. It CHOSE to declare war on Russia in 1854 (and invaded Crimea together with France, after some naval bombardment of the Russian cities). These few examples give you the taste, but they are really countless. Perhaps the first war of the 20th century - about which Ferguson was curiously silent -- was the British decision to wrestle control of the South Africa from the Boers.

The British war against the Boers was brutal and modern; complete with trenches, population reprisal and concentrations camps. It was an non-illustrious start, which set the tone for the rest of the terrible XX century. Today, the Great Britain CHOSE to go to war in both Iraq and Afghanistan as an America's junior partner. I would not recommend the film - it is an illustration to implausible theories.",1318032000,12,3987,5.087155963302752

3516791,4,B001CR499I,"This DVD serves as an excellent cliff-notes style synopsis of the approximately 900 page book it is based on. It covers, in a nutshell, the main theme of the book, that race, tensions between nation states in decline and on the rise, and economic depression were the main causes of the main causes of the largest conflicts (i.e., WWI and WWII) of the century. He also drives home the point that no matter what a nation states ideology, when it comes to fighting war, race has been much more important than it has been ""politically corrrect"" to say of late. Even states with very different ideologies and belief structures (i.e., Nazi Germany, Imperial Japan, Britain and the U.S.) can engage in warfare, along racial lines, in the most barbaric manners possible. As Ferguson repeatedly points out using the analogy with HG Well's ""War of the Worlds"", humans can see those of other races and members of other nation states, as little more than ""aliens"" and dole out the same treatment the Martians did to the humans in the Wells book.

If all one is interested in is a cliff-notes synopsis of the book, lasting 3 hours, this DVD fulfills that function. Naturally however, due to its short length, it does not provide the depth, nuances and tangents that the book does. For readers interested in these the book would be well worth the signficant investment in time required.",1273881600,7,1372,4.764705882352941
3516792,5,B001CR499I,"At the very first,I was most impressed by the Presenters efforts to cover what at 1st is ground that has been covered in great detail by other historians. (The Russo- Japanese War, The 1905 Russian Revolution, WWI, The Balkans problems,The Rise of Gangster States of Lenin, Stalin,Hitler, Imperial Japan & WWII)
  But what really grabbed my attention and respect, was his coverage of what he called the ""Third World"" war. Which was fought by the competing Super Powers of the ""Cold"" War era in the 3rd world in a series of ""Bush Wars"". (Which were devastating to the locals) I was only disappointed that no mention of the Korean War was made. What I also really enjoyed was the section on the Fall of the Soviet Empire. I was however surprised on was not mentioned. Like how flat footed the West was by the sudden collaspe of that Empire. But that is only real issue that I take with him.

8288809,5,B001CR499I,"Ferguson gives us a mostly conventional account of the 20th-century from WW1 to the present day. He focuses on the major wars and highlights examples of ethnic cleansing and genocide. The mass killings of tyrants like Hitler, Stalin, Mao, and Pol Pot are difficult to comprehend today. Ferguson leaves you with the impression that the human race may have a serious design flaw. Ferguson ends by discussing Islamism, another ""ism"" which has given itself permission to kill people who happen to be different.

Ferguson believes that what makes the 20th century different is its death toll: ""The hundred years after 1900 were without question the bloodiest century in history, far more violent in relative as well as absolute terms than any previous era."" In all, between 167 million and 188 million people died because of organized violence in the twentieth century -- as many as one in every 22 deaths in that period. He believes the main causes were ethnic hatred, economic upheavals, the end of ""old"" empires (Russia, Austria-Hungary, China, Ottoman Empire), and the creation of ""new"" empires (Germany, Japan, the Soviet Union).

Apart from the Holocaust, we seem to have forgotten about most of the ethnic killings of the last century. Ferguson discusses the Soviet gulags, the Armenian genocide, the Rape of Nanking, and the violence in Yugoslavia. Hitler hated Jews and Slavs. Stalin was another evil monster who distrusted the Soviet Unions ethnic minorities and whole peoples were ... marked down for destruction. The Russians and Germans treated the Poles in a similar manner  brutally. He tells us that the Japanese viewed the Chinese as vermin to be exterminated. Yugoslavia had been an integrated society under Tito's rule, but after he died neighbor killed neighbor. The war crimes described in the documentary are disturbing and hard to understand.

The Nazis mission to destroy the Jewish people was made much easier because of the public in most European countries, often acted as willing accomplices. Anti-Semitism wasn't just practiced by Germans. This is something that has been airbrushed from history. Ferguson points out that in order to win the war the Allies also behaved badly. American troops routinely shot Japanese prisoners of war and the British savagely bombed German cities, purposely killing civilians. At least 35,000 died in Dresden, and the raid was immortalized in Kurt Vonnegut's novel Slaughterhouse 5. The Allies came to believe that they had been too soft at the end of WW1. They did not invade Germany and the Germans began to believe that they had not lost the war. The strategy in WW2 was to crush the enemy and leave Germany and Japan in no doubt who won.

Ferguson believes that nationalism and theories of racial difference played a role in producing ideas of racial superiority. This was an unfortunate by-product of Darwins theories of evolution. The concept of a nation-state and its overlapping racist theories fractured apart a great deal of Europes diverse populations whom, by the turn of the century, were actually highly assimilated. Societies resorted to genocide believing that their neighbors were sub-human.

Ferguson implies that ethnic strife is part of the human condition and it will happen again. He believes that racial harmony cannot be guaranteed even in countries that appear integrated as in 1930s Germany. Violence can re-emerge when the economy is struggling or there are periods of upheaval. He finishes by showing lots of Muslims flooding into Europe. This is a subject that most historians tend to avoid and Ferguson is brave to discuss it. Multiculturism is viewed as the antidote by our leaders but Ferguson does not say whether it will work.

Ferguson uses Czechoslovakia as an example. The country was created by the politicians who drafted the Versailles Treaty. It was made up of 5 main ethnicities: Czechs, Germans, Poles, Slovaks, and Hungarians. The Czechs were the largest ethnic group, with about 51% of the population, and they looked down upon and repressed the other ethnic groups. This created an opening for Hitler and led to the country's downfall. In 1938, Poland, Hungary and Germany all seized part of Czechoslovakia and the people in those regions seemed glad to join their motherlands. The Germans gave the Slovaks independence and they fought on the German side in Poland and the Soviet Union. Allied leaders in the 1940s seemed to understand that ethnic strife could be a problem in post-war Europe. At the Potsdam Conference in 1945, there was a desire to create ethnically homogeneous nation-states. Winston Churchill said that the ""mixture of populations [will] ...cause endless trouble."" About 12 million Germans were expelled from Eastern Europe, and 2 million died on route.

Ferguson's documentary focuses on the dark side of human nature and tells us that military force has often been needed to keep ethnic tensions under control. The film is educational but also sad and depressing.",1462752000,,4989,5.150617283950617
