6440298,5,B00KQ82IRE,"This movie is an instant classic and collector's item.  It's a Zombie movie that ties into it the real life horror of the effects of pharmaceuticals, which happen to be the 4th leading cause of deaths in the U.S.  And it actually makes zombie apocalypse a plausible scenario for perhaps the first time in zombie flick history.  It possesses the campy scary movie style that attracts us horror flick fans like no other.  There are some great performances by folks like John Doe,  Kinky Friedman, Sid Haig, Malcolm McDowell, Corey Feldman, and various other real life characters of the musical world and pop culture.  It will take multiple viewings to discern them.  Emily Kaye is like a female Clint Eastwood.  Director, Jesse Dayton will go on to rule the world.",1413072000,,762,4.8076923076923075
6440299,1,B00KQ82IRE,"There is nothing different about this movie. Just the same ole zombie hodgepodge of gore, bad acting, ho hum scenery. A movie to skip.",1412467200,,134,4.625
6440300,4,B00KQ82IRE,"For surreal moments in cinema, you can't beat Malcolm McDowell (in a lab coat) meeting Corey Feldman (also in a lab coat) shaking hands like they're old pals from way back. Well, of course they are. Why wouldn't they be? This is a funny, weird little movie, inexpensively made (save for the cameos), with some not-so-sly commentary about how Prozac makes zombies of us all. Pretend you're in your car at a drive-in while watching this. Or have someone dress up as Svengoolie to introduce it. That'll get you in the spirit.",1412121600,5,522,4.684782608695652
6440301,1,B00KQ82IRE,"Just awful.
As a fan of zombie movies, I have seen some really good ones and some spectacularly bad ones.  This is one of the worst I have ever seen.  It fails not just as a zombie film, but as any type of entertainment.",1410739200,,220,3.977272727272727
6440302,4,B00KQ82IRE,"First off, David Christopher and Lew Temple drew me right in; director Jesse Dayton has style to burn! That was the key for me: a zombie movie  with an underlying feeling of dread primarily through the dreamy/nightmarish camera eye.  Then there's the chilling reality of our current street drugs (bath salts, meth) creating similar effects on people as do the ""anti-depressants""  presented in Zombex.

What up Tom! Hopefully you'll be a zombie in the sequel! Great to see you walking the road--I recognized you immediately. R.I.P. Hanneman. Slayer forever!!!

Zombex 2 anyone? Bring all the survivors back--I'd buy it w/o hesitation. This has been my first Amazon review.",1409961600,2,671,5.175925925925926

6440304,3,B00KQ82IRE,This was a n okay movie. Those zombies were too smart for their own good. They moved just a little too fast for me. Was corny but funny and believable. Characters were amusing. Seeing this one time is enough.,1409788800,,208,4.358974358974359
6440305,1,B00KQ82IRE,"If I could give this movie negative 10 stars I would.  There was no plot, no real acting, the 'stars' Sid Haig, Malcolm McDowell, and Corey Feldman were in the movie for a total of 3 minutes.  Oh yeah, there was also no ending.  The movie just stopped. I don't know if they ran out of time or ran out of film, but they didn't even try for an ending. Don't waste your time or money---this film is worth neither.  I've never reviewed a movie like this before, but I wish someone had tried to save me from wasting my time and money on this piece of garbage.",1409529600,3,554,4.101851851851852
6440306,2,B00KQ82IRE,"In post Katrina days, Chandler Pharmaceutical company distributes an anti-stress drug that turns people into zombies. Charlie (David Christopher) and conspiracy DJ Aldous (Lew Temple) fight their way out of Louisiana along with company that includes Black Rain security agent and dancer Katie Ann (Emily Kaye).

Let's see. Grindhouse, New Orleans, Zombies, and Sid Haig. What is not to like? The special zombie effects went from great to cheap. Sid Haig plays a straight military character and makes his first appearance 12 minutes from the end of the film. Malcolm McDowell has a slightly less cameo role. The film had some good scenes, but not great scenes. It also had too many scenes that didn't work well. In one scene they opt to spend the night in a boat to be safe, but stay tied up to the pier. Guess how that works out? The film spent too much time showing Aldous broadcasting about Chandler Pharmacy. Instead of constantly showing the guy talking in the studio, have it play in the background while faces are being eaten. David Christopher also gave us a boring character. The tough girl character of Katie Ann fell a little short.

Not the worse zombie film out there. Just don't expect too much from the over billed stars that make cameos.

8660723,3,B00KQ82IRE,"The music is GREAT. The effects look good. The way the scenes were shot - all that is good.  Storyline....not so much.  It's moving along well, then just sort of goes poof. The ending seems rushed.  The film could have benefited from maybe effort/money spent on the cake (story, direction) rather than the icing of recognizable actors. Trying to be constructive here, rather than negative. I dig Jesse Dayton's work and I know the guy put a lot of sweat into this project. Who knows though - this might become some huge cult classic.",1417219200,2,533,4.648936170212766
8660724,1,B00KQ82IRE,"let us hope these folks don't make part 2 or any sequel or prequel. I can't even give this horrible DVD a $5 rating.  not only a horrible work lacking any followable story or even good acting but it's even worse than that. I couldn't tell if I was watching someone scanning channels on their DVR between War in the middle east, the devil's rejects, dukes of hazard and cry baby. No Zombie Movie Classic has a real good ending but these guys just forgot to give the movie an ending. Since everyone so easily gave up before they accomplished anything I have to add that I wish the Director, Producer, Writers and Actors had given up before it even began. if you really intend on watching this sorry tale first borrow a copy from somebody and then drink at least a fifth of some good bourbon or scotch first. no it won't make the movie any better but you won't care.",1415232000,2,863,4.327160493827161
