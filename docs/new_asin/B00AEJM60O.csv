5412495,5,B00AEJM60O,"""Riddle"" is a pretty good, low budget mystery/thriller. Not really a horror, violence is tame (implied for the most part), no swearing or adult situations. This movie is about a teen girl whose mildly autistic brother disappears one day while joy riding with two teenage party boys and the discovery she makes three years later involving a Silent Hill type of town called Riddle.

5412512,2,B00AEJM60O,"Bad and melodramatic acting. I really can't believe that Val Kilmer is reduced to this kind of role. Actors (not all) said their lines like they were reading them; with no emotions. The storyline itself has the potential to become a good movie, though you can see the reveal coming.

5412517,3,B00AEJM60O,"Lots of suspense and mystery in the beginning that keeps the viewer engaged.  By the end, however, there are too many loose ends which is disappointing.  Rather than solving the mystery, the viewer has more questions in the end than the beginning of the story.  Some details that initially add to the mystery will never be explained and really have little to do with the plot.  The ""happy end"" is rather unsatisfactory.  Instead of conclusions, people who add to the mystery get conveniently killed taking their sinister secrets to the grave.  Too bad because this could have been a better suspense/mystery movie if some of the details had been expanded on.",1427068800,,657,4.873873873873874

While I wouldn't necessarily want to pay to see this movie, it certainly held my attention and was tense a few times.  The story line was interesting and just enough surprises throughout the movie to keep you pondering what will happen next.  While it would have been nice to have an explanation at the end. . .I think the clues within the movie are answer enough. I love mysteries of any kind and so that is why I enjoyed this movie.  And as for the reviewers who said the acting is bad. . .trust me, I have seen bad acting and this is not it.  The actors know what they are doing and it is not cheesy like other lame movies I have actually seen.

5412538,3,B00AEJM60O,I was not impressed with Val Kilmer's performance in this movie.  This is the best movie I have seen Elisabeth Harnois in.  It was quite surprising how the young people of Riddle helped her find her little brother.  I did not expect the cooperation from them that she received.  I don't understand why the sheriff of the town would allow such a sick person to run free.,1407456000,,369,4.462686567164179

The town and asylum both are creepy and there is gory violence, so if that turns your stomach, don't watch!  This is not great art cinema but certainly fun for a lazy afternoon in front of the TV.",1406851200,,415,4.447368421052632
5412541,1,B00AEJM60O,"Not my kind of movie at all.  Acting not that great. A Few things in plot don't add up, and cannot tell you how it ended because I cut it off when it started getting gory.",1406505600,,171,3.75
5412542,2,B00AEJM60O,"I rented this movie with the expectation that I was getting something of a mystery with Val Kilmer playing a key role. What I got was something along the lines of Scooby Doo meets Friday the 13th.

Holly and Nathan are a brother and sister attending the local high school.  Nathan is a little slow.  Two punks take Nathan for a ride, and we suspect that they are going to do something awful to Nathan, but before that can happen, Nathan just disappears. Flash-forward a few years and Holly is in college and - Quelle Surprise! - she spots Nathan at the local market, but he leaves in a pick-up truck.  She follows him, wrecks her car and gets stranded in the decaying mine town of Riddle, Pennsylvania.

Riddle is a town of mystery.  Everyone acts mysterious.  The town appears to be deserted, and, yet, there seems to be a population there somewhere.  Very mysterious.

Val Kilmer is very mysterious.  He's the sheriff but he doesn't want to help Holly.  Basically, during the entire movie Kilmer's role is to glower, bark at the young folk and not do anything. He accomplishes this acting assignment very well.

Holly meets up with the two punks who took her brother on a ride They've grown up a bit. She also reconnects with a high school friend. It seems that Riddle is the ""other side of the tracks"" from where she lives. Oddly, this friend is the daughter of Val Kilmer...or maybe the whole town has about 20 people living in it, so it's not that odd. That wasn't clear.

Suddenly, the movie goes from mystery to Scooby Doo, as the young people are chased by ""mean Mr. Smithers,"" except that Mr. Smithers isn't afraid of using an axe or a shovel to hide the mystery.

This movie features a lot of wooden acting and wooden dialogue and a feel that plot is being thrown together on the spot. It also features that essential trope of the genre - lots of time chewed up watching girls run poorly.  If you are fan of the teen slasher genre, then this might be your cup of joe, albeit you don't get a lot of that until the final 20 minutes.

Val Kilmer was obviously phoning it in.  As I watched the movie, I wondered, what's with the pony tail? Was that supposed to tweak his character in an interesting way?  Or was he just too uninvested in the role to get a hair cut?

On the other hand, the main character - Holly - played by Elizabeth Harnois - looks like she's got some acting chops.  Let's hope that is able to climb her way into something more coherent.",1405814400,,2462,4.392935982339956
5412543,3,B00AEJM60O,"This movie has such potential, but it took the wrong path to the end.  This is one of those cases where you have to use the phrase  such a shame.  The description for the film clearly states a child goes missing, so this is not a spoiler.  It is his sister who goes in search of him.  The beginning part, leading up the disappearance, was interesting since it doesnt happen the way you were expecting.  So, I was happy with that, and wanted to keep watching.  Then the child is sighted  or is he?

Now it is here the film really got me hooked, as the sister (Elisabeth Harnois) enters the mysterious town of Riddle.  When the words sanitarium and adoption are mentioned, I really perked up and thought  oh yeah, this can go in so many great directions and should really be a great mystery story (I was actually hoping something as mysterious as a modern version of Picnic at Hanging Rock).  Plus, there is a scene at a quarry mine that adds to the mystery, and for a second we wonder  who can be trusted in the town of Riddle?

But it is shortly after this that any hope of it being a mystery movie dies out.  Instead the film slowly changes from being a mystery to a chase the teens with a weapon movie (think Friday the 13th or any teen slasher flick).  I became disappointed, but at this point I had invested too much time to quit, and made myself watch it to the end  thinking maybe they will explain some of what happened.  While I was happy with the very ending of the film, and glad no cheap clichs were thrown in, I was just disappointed in what this movie could and should have been.

The film is worth watching because the lead actress, Elisabeth Harnois, is so adorable and the other female lead, Diora Baird, is so pretty that you could watch this with a group of people and then spend the rest of the evening debating on who was prettier (to me, it is a tie).  But this should not take away from their acting talents, as they are top notch and everyone else is credible, plus you have Val Kilmer and William Sadler on hand to add the heavy street cred.  So, if you are a member of Amazon Prime it is worth watching for free.  Maybe in 20 years this film will be remade, but then with a better third and fourth act  as a full-fledged mystery.",1405209600,3,2254,4.23943661971831
5412544,4,B00AEJM60O,"I make an attempt to read some of the reviews here and then try to make a determination if I want to watch a movie based on the two to four star reviews. After watching Riddle, I found that I must have been watching a different movie from those that rated it one or two stars. I keep thinking perhaps Amazon should include the age of the reviewer because  this was a pretty decent movie and I realize there might be some younger kids that review it expecting so much more that they give it low ratings. For example, one person said it was an ok movie....and then gave it one star. Huh?

Actually, it was more than an ok movie. No, it is not your typical teenage gore fest, thankfully. It's also not your Oscar worthy best picture, but it is a pretty decent movie that has plenty of suspense. My rating...four stars. I enjoyed it!",1405123200,5,829,4.273885350318471
5412545,1,B00AEJM60O,"There was no plot or character development to this farce.  The acting was terrible.

5412549,3,B00AEJM60O,I wanted to really like this movie but in the end I found it just ok. I'm not sure what the director was going for. It was not suspenseful enough to be a drama nor frightening enough to be a horror movie. And they tout Val Kilmer on the cover but he really had a minor part in the movie and seemed to be phoning it in when he did have screen time.

5412561,1,B00AEJM60O,"One of my favorite actors in an ingratiatingly horrible movie. How much was he paid for his ten or so one-line script readings? $50,000 per line maybe? I was about to stop watching after 30 minutes but continued watching in the hope that it would get better. It only got worse. The inconsistencies and clunky/corny script are laughable in the light that some people thought this was an OK movie. The only consistency is that cops are useless, self-serving imbeciles.

First this is a mystery, not horror.
Second, this is a mystery with suspense.  Not an action thriller.
Yes, it started off with the background story, and built the mystery of the boy's disappearance around that background. I didn't find the beginning slow at all, just a buildup to the main plot.
The story is good, and the acting better than adequate.
The story could have used a bit more build up of the supporting characters but if you don't have to have every detail spoon fed to you, you can infer quite a bit from the existing story line.
If you are looking for an action packed thriller mystery, this is not it.  If you are looking for an  entertaining mystery with a suspenseful ending this is more than adequate.",1383782400,22,769,4.478571428571429

5412586,4,B00AEJM60O,"Definitely worth watching, unlike most of the smut Hollywood is churning out these days...I don't understand all the negative reviews for this movie.  I can only imagine that they come from 1. horror fans who were expecting something completely different 2. those in some way against actors/creators/others involved in the movie's making.  It was actually a decent suspense/thriller (my fave type of movie)-the only bad thing is, once you've seen this type of film it doesn't usually warrant a second viewing bc the secret is out.  Was not terribly complicated, but it didn't give everything away, in other words kept the suspense up throughout, whcih is what the best suspense films do.  Beautiful cinematography, definitely didn't look B-movie-ish to me.  Although I miss Val in his heydey (and his heydey looks), I enjoy checking out his newer flicks as well.

SPOILER ALERT: Although I never understood a couple things: 1. Just how did an anti-social psychopath like the dad manage to abduct his son in about a ten-minute maximum timeframe from a town gas station without any outside help, when the boy lived in a different town to begin with...  and  2. Why did he light on fire so easily when the girl threw the matches on him, as if he had gasoline all over him?  and 3.  How did the girl survive the electic shocks without any brain damage or being unconsious?

One mesage I took from Riddle was that not everyone is as bad as they seem--since we are distrustful of all the characters through the movie, it is a relief to find out the truth in the end.  All in all a pleasing movie-watching experience.",1379462400,3,1610,4.751798561151079

But at least you can work on being positive about things in life that really suck. At the end, we basically laughed about how horrible of a movie we just watched.  As a matter of fact, the movie was so bad, we actually decided to write our first review.

5412594,1,B00AEJM60O,"This is a low budget horror flick that is not at all horrifying. William Sadler and Val Kilmer are fairly big names, but in today's rough economy, I reckon even the big boys gotta eat. Why anyone of their ilk would accept this script is beyond me. Time for a new agent, fellas!

This disjointed, absurd film had one good quality. I fell asleep about 30 minutes in and slept til the final scene. It was that boring. People new to horror flicks might find it worth a fright. If you are six years old, maybe. But in the realm of adult horror movies, this one leaves a lot to be desired. Some nice videography of rural PA. But nothing to write home about otherwise. This movie was filmed in 2010 but apparently (According to the description) was released in 2012? That is unusual since most investors want to recoup their money ASAP.

Anyway, if the pain has dried and the grass isn't growing, and there is nothing on TV except Oprah re-runs, take a chance and watch it. I saw it free on PRIME. I am GLAD I didn't pay to watch it, and I could not condone buying it.

Some of these movies are those ones I've never heard and I like that because I know nothing about the movie (no previous hype or trailers) and consequently no expectations.  So unless the movie is totally terrible, it provides an acceptable level of entertainment.  This is one of those movies.  I would not have paid to see it, but for what I do, it was okay.  The chubby Val Kilmer is in it along with a bunch of sorta unknowns.  It is a mystery that sort of turns a tad horror-ish in the last quarter, but the acting and production was not bad.

It was a quaint little town filled with stores, banks, theaters, apartments, taverns, a library, a post office, schools, bridges crossing the Monongahela River....just a lovely little town always full of people.

This is not a video game nor is it a slasher/gore bloodfest.  If that is what you are looking for then you are obviously in the wrong place.  A really good thriller takes it's time.  It slowly unveils itself.  This is how to build suspense and the director and the actors certainly understand that, if the viewer doesn't.  The production values are not ""poor"" as another viewer claimed.  It is an indie flick which means they have to make due with the funds at hand.  In the case of this story, the town, and how it looks are important and can be said to be a character just as the actors are.  There are questions that either don't get answered or that take awhile to develop.  We are on this journey with Holly, we learn as she does.  We come to know the characters through their actions as the story unfolds.  Is this Nightmare on Elm Street? No, and it is the better for it.  William Sadler is a master at being intimidating and a little bit creepy without even trying. We don't see much of him but we learn a great deal about him by the end.  Val Kilmer has been a rare talent for 30 years.  He is not in this film much and one wishes he were and that he had more to work with.  Even so he conveys a great deal with a look and we can feel frustrated and seen him battling his demons, especially in those moments he is failing those he is meant to serve.  I was not familiar with any of the young actors in this film but I will certainly be on the lookout from now on.  I would love to see more of Brian Lillis and Ben Bledsoe.

Three years later, his big sister swears she sees her brother and believes he's in Riddle.  She seeks the local sheriff's help to no avail so she takes matters into her own hands.  From there, it's a by the book chase movie heading to a fairly predictable conclusion.
Elizabeth Harnois (CSI, Criminal Minds) lacks the emotional range to be completely convincing.  A sleepwalking Val Kilmer plays the sheriff and William Sadler shows up as the town big shot.

Riddle is one I don't regret buying at all, and was much better than I thought it would be based on the negative reviews I read prior to watching it.  This was quite good and very tense in places.  My wife had to pause it toward the end, just because she was so stressed out and couldn't see how the characters were going to get out of their predicament.  It does a nice job of slowly bringing you more and more into an unsettled creepiness, with new revelations only adding to the disjointed feeling of not having anyone you can trust in a place that you certainly would never want to be at all.  By the end, it ramps up into out and out horror, with blood and body counts and a very scary climax.

The town itself is a character all on it's own.  The cinematography is amazing and very scary.  I don't think I'd ever want to go to an old mining town after watching this movie.  Val Kilmer gives a wonderfully subtle performance, making you sympathize with a troubled sheriff who has his own demons, and says so much with a simple glance.  I was glad to see him in this.  And finally the score stuck out to me, too.  I even looked it up to see if it was available on disc, because it stood out on its own in ways few scores manage to do.

RIDDLE is a somewhat underdeveloped but eminently watchable film that relies more on mystery and intrigue than it does gore and schlock, a pleasant change from many recent horror films. It would be strengthened by more complex layers of plot regarding the jinxed town, the condemned loony bin, and how they both tie-in to Nathan's disappearance. The pacing--too fast in certain places, too slow in others--also works against this film. Nevertheless, there are some interesting nuances, mostly realistic but with slight hints of the supernatural. Fine camera work with some really stunning rural Pennsylvanian scenery. While it's not Val Kilmer's finest hour, the character he plays is almost enhanced by tepid acting. The actors who play the teenagers all give impressive performances here.",1361404800,14,803,5.424
