1640602,3,B00005O5N5,"Sister Wendy's American collection box set is an interesting survey of art collected in six American museums. About two thirds of the works surveyed merit the time dedicated to them. Her comments on art and specific works in general are MOSTLY informative and insightful but the format is marred by her use of ""WE"" and US"" in describing HER feelings on specific works.  Also, can we ever find a documentary that is not catered to hide a politically correct message behind it? I want to learn and understand art history not be given a feminist lecture.",1146441600,3,551,4.739583333333333
1640603,5,B00005O5N5,If you love Sister Wendy then there is no need for a review on this collection. She has a wonderful persona and opens up a knew understanding of art for those who know little about this world. Art becomes more than simply a famous piece of artwork or an ancient artifact etc.. because Sister Wendy gives you a different prespective from the inside out! Great work! About time you could get her on DVD!,1128556800,3,401,4.4324324324324325
1640604,5,B00005O5N5,"Any half-decent or better University Art History class is sure to appreciate the perspectives Sister Wendy brings to these discs. Sister Wendy does a brillant job, as always, with the American Collection!  You will be a better person for watching and understanding this collection.",1115683200,12,281,5.386363636363637
1640605,5,B00005O5N5,"Sister Wendy Beckett has done for art appreciation and art history what the late Carl Sagan did for the science of astronomy: she has taken a subject that most people would like to know more about, but fear is beyond their ability to understand, and made it accessible and entertaining.  She has wrested art from the hands of intellectuals and elitists and given it back to the people, to whom it has always rightfully belonged.  Some people appear to resent this.  The rest of us should stand up and cheer.

In this charming series, Sister Wendy visits six of the United States' most renowned art museums and shares with her viewers some of their masterpieces.  Her opinions, sometimes whimsical, sometimes wistful and sometimes reverent, are delivered with great passion and enthusiasm.  This open love of her subject matter is infectious and draws the viewer to her and to the art works she so clearly loves.  This is what makes her so effective as a guide and teacher.

Sister Wendy also makes a wonderfully evocative use of language, at one point, during a discussion of Grant Wood's ""American Gothic"" she describes the woman's hair as having been ""...scraped back in a bun.""  This captured the woman's hairstyle with such economy and vividness that I, in my mind's eye, could see her combing her hair into a repressed little bun.  Except for that one tendril, which Sister Wendy also points out to her viewers.

Like all those who view a work of art, Sister Wendy brings her own, unique perspective to each work she has chosen to discuss.  Nowhere is this more powerfully shown than in her discussion of the Kinbell's ""An Exiled Emperor on Okinoshima.""  While most people would perceive the solitary figure on the Japanese screen as lonely and isolated, Sister Wendy, who spends most of her time alone in silent contemplation and prayer, at first sees a kindred spirit.  This leads her to identify with the Emperor in ways most people would never dream of and she shares her unique perspective with us.  And we are richer, not just for seeing the screen and hearing her interpretation, but also for having been given this tiny scrap of insight into a life most of us can't even imagine.

Through her books and television series, Sister Wendy has given us something she seems to greatly admire about the United States: Freedom.  The freedom to look at a work of art and interpret and enjoy it through our own particular lens, our own perspective.  By showing and telling us how she understands and appreciates art, Sister Wendy invites us to take the liberty to do likewise.

Thank you, Sister Wendy!",1093046400,27,2605,4.774553571428571
1640606,1,B00005O5N5,"I bought this ""American Collection"" based on the European series which aired on PBS.  The European experience I enjoyed, but this American jaunt was a journey to Tedium. This is a travelogue about cities and museums with some art tossed in to justify to whole production.  Sister Wendy chatters endlessly about her opinions, her living quarters, and more items than I wanted or cared to hear about.  The whole project is too ambitious for the time frame of six hours.  For example, Vermeer painted only 34 paintings that exist today.  One museum visted has 5 hanging.  Wow!  A chance to view 5 of the 34, but Sister Wendy blew buy the first 4, and went on endlessly about the 5th one.  The time would have been better  spent by viewing each for a few moments, whereby I could have done a freeze frame.  Save your money.",1007078400,22,819,4.5479452054794525

I was hoping the book would still be with the box set, but it wasn't. However the 3 DVDs are in pristine condition, they're really great :)",1456012800,,225,4.512195121951219
7948446,5,B00005O5N5,I love Sister Wendy.  She has the gift of bringing art to life.  Her knowledge is so extensive.  All of Sister Wendy's collections are excellent.  The time passes so fast when you travel with her and visit museums.,1403222400,,214,4.552631578947368
7948447,4,B00005O5N5,"I didn't see these programs when they were originally on PBS TV, but this collection visits six American art museums and she chose very interesting works of art in each museum.  She made a seventh museum visit in the US that is not in this collection and is not available anywhere other than the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena, but you can get it at their shop.  I like these museum visits better than the European ones she did!",1373328000,,429,4.417721518987341
7948448,5,B00005O5N5,Sister Wendy brings such fresh insight to art and a passion and joy that is completely infectious.  It's like touring the world's greatest museums with a close friend.,1367539200,,167,4.964285714285714

7948450,5,B00005O5N5,"So maybe listening to Sister Wendy's art-analysis it is not like going to the National Gallery (DC)  and hearing the latest, brilliant hotshot (and hot!) art scholar they have as one of the special fellows. But Sister Wendy is charming, and knows a thing or two. And she is pro-Gay de facto. That is, she acknowledges homo-eros unflinchingly and without opprobrium as part of the background for many a great work of art. That's good enough from someone of her age, and life-style, as it were. By that I mean, to be so compassionately worldly from a cloistered convent no less is a special virtue, and certainly adds to her charm. People can recognize the amplitude of religious tolerance, which is the real sign of the work of Grace in a life, that's why they like her.. God bless Sister Wendy! She's my kind of  religious gal.",1340496000,6,827,4.619047619047619
7948451,4,B00005O5N5,"Sister Wendy visits 6 museums in the US and criticizes about 10 works of art in each. Rather than focusing on the most famous pieces, she chooses works that speak to her. This results in fairly impassioned discussions, emphasizing the emotions each piece elicits in her.

I think this series is good for the casual art viewer who's looking for inspiration for their next museum visit. Sister Wendy's enthusiasm can be infectious, and I can see how she inspires people to look at art more closely and open themselves up to being ""spoken to"". If you're looking to become more educated in art history, this probably isn't the best place to start. While she generally gives good historical context and description of the artistic movement in which works reside, she jumps around far too much (from contemporary American abstract to ancient Egyptian reliefs) to establish any sense for the flow of history.",1335657600,,901,4.927631578947368
