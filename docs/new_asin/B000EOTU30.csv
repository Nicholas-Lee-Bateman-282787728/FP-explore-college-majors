8246948,5,B000EOTU30,this was the last one I needed to complete the collection. I'm very glad I have it.,1427068800,,83,3.9411764705882355
8246949,3,B000EOTU30,"I have to say that as a big fan of Godannar, I was let down by this volume. It was bad enough that it was only three episodes, but Goh and Anna and the others of Dannar Base were barely in it. Of course this is a couple of filler episodes, but upon a second and third viewing I came to like it a lot more. Its still not on par with the previous volumes but I liked finally seeing a little more backround on the allied teams, especially the Russian team and the Chinese team. As a matter of fact, I would place the last episode of the disc in my top 5 episodes, but thats not hard because of these 3 episodes, the Dannar team was in it the most and I love the English team, and with what happens to the Chinese team, it really furthered the overall storyline with a lot of heart and forshadowing. I could have done without the American team storyline but hey as we all know Godannar covers it all.  I invite anyone who likes this series or discussions on it to check out my website at community.webtv.net/GodannarJunkie",1152230400,,1018,4.1938775510204085
8246950,1,B000EOTU30,"Up till now the story has mainly focused on Goh and Anna, Vol 5 is all about the other pilots in the first volume. Vasconia, her Servant, and their relationship, She hates the way he never has an opinion of his own, but the truth is serving her with all his heart is the only way he feels he can show his love.  Genesister are two Girl pilots that love each other and, they KNOW its considered Taboo to be in love and wish they were opposite sexes, but Luna spends most of the episode Anguishing over that problem. They don't actually have sex, so it can't really be called hentai. Finally team GodDinner becomes engaged, and invites Goh and Anna to the wedding If you bought the first 5 volumes for the crazy relationships than this is right up your alley. Even thou the story with Goh and Anna is in the background for now, there is still a lot of Giant Robot fighting, and you get to see their powers.",1147392000,,904,4.255813953488372
8246951,5,B000EOTU30,"Up until now, Godannar has done a perfect job of keeping the perversion and girlyness under control. Girly shots go by fast, and aren't shown for the same perverted reasons used by all the stereotypical girly animes out there. Godannar is all about action, the mood is always serious, and the show is all about style.

But some of those restrictions got lifted for this volume.

Lesbians!!! I was expecting this volume to take a new turn towards the hentai side of things, but even I did not expect it to go quite this far. Viewers will be super shocked and/or super pleased to see Godannar do things it has never done before. It was sad to see Godannar degrade itself in the first ""lesbian"" scene, but the other lesbian scenes that came later were more serious and I thought they were good. Sometimes the stupid arguing and marriage crap that Goh and Anna go through gets on my nerves, and the Russian couple that started off in this volume was not any better. Fortunately, lesbians came to the rescue, erasing all those annoying marriage issues away. Hurray!

There was a death as well in this volume, but exactly who it is turns out to be a bit of a surprise. One mystery is explained, although there are still a lot left, which I hope get explained eventually.

The preview for Godannar Volume 6 is AMAZING!!! I think it has a good chance to surpass Volumes 1 and 3 as the best Godannar DVD. It looks to be 100% action, back to the level of the first episodes or more, if that is even possible. ADVision loves to create fake girly previews that do not reflect the actual show content, as we've seen before in the earlier Godannar DVDs. But they couldn't find anything girly to use for the Volume 6 preview so it contains all fighting. Hell's Wind!!!!!! Counter Knuckle!!

But those techniques might look like baby attacks after what we see in Godannar Volume 6, so I'm really looking forward to it!",1146700800,3,1902,4.517441860465116
