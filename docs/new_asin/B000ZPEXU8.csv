8236241,4,B000ZPEXU8,This was a movie that had more twist and turns than a road course in Europe. The ending was unforseen. Good movie never the least. Pierce B was excellent.,1280188800,,154,4.344827586206897
8236242,1,B000ZPEXU8,"""Entangled"" attempted to be a cryptic mystery, but instead achieved ""what the heck is going on"" status. Punctuated by nudity and sex scenes, one gets the feeling that someone added the  ""storyline"" AFTER they conceived the great idea to film a  softcore porn flick.
Characters are thin, motivations are thinner, and  you never actually get the full story.
Since there aren't any other  comments for this movie, I'll give a brief synopsis: American author wakes  up hysterical in the hospital, fully covered in casts and bandages.  Flashbacks ensue, and we learn that he has written one previous novel that  was killed by the critics, his lover is a french supermodel who is up to  something fishy, and he has just finished his second novel, which he  eventually enters in a literary contest under temporarily anonymous  authorship. Somehow he ends up mangled in the hospital, but how? We spend  the rest of the miserable movie wondering not that, but, why do we  care?
During the course of the movie, we find out about murder,  deception, lust, power plays, double crossings, greed, and betrayal. Sounds  interesting, but don't be tricked. It is forced, but worse, completely  unlikely and highly contrived; the plot twists are not intriguing, but  banal. A murky movie does not a mystery make.
Judd Nelson is completely  pretentious and uncharismatic. He appears to have some intellect, but  doesn't really lend believability to his lines (did he really understand  some of the words he said?). Also, he can play the bandaged, mangled,  be-stitched gimp to perfection, but the lover of a supermodel? I don't  believe it.
Why did Pierce Brosnan agree to do this movie? I know it was  in his pre-007, post-Remington Steele days when he wasn't too hot a  commodity, but this was truly an awful script, and his role was  farcical.
Run. Run far away from this movie, before you waste 90 minutes  of your precious time getting Entangled.",963446400,,1932,4.925465838509317
