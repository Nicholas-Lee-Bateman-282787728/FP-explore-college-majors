8061559,5,B0009IWFW4,I bought this to replace a video version which I wore out! I love it.,1439683200,,69,3.6666666666666665
8061560,5,B0009IWFW4,"If you have ever been to Colonial Williamsburg and visited Carter's Grove Plantation which now lays in ruins, you may wish to own this video.  It is one of the few places you can get to see inside it's once stately rooms.  Our family visited Williamsburg in 2015 and I was disappointed to know that we could no longer tour this great plantation as I wanted to share it with my teenage children.",1437523200,,394,4.383561643835616
8061561,4,B0009IWFW4,"I originally ordered this product only to open up the case and find no DVD disk inside.  Being from Australia its not like I could just go down the street and pick up another copy.  I wrote to Finley Holiday Films about this and they sent me out a disk which I received within a week.  I cannot thank Finley Holidays Films enough for their integrity and timely way they handled my order issue.  Having watched the dvd (72 mins) now I am glad I purchased this item as it gives you a good overview of the homes which for me not being able to travel to a few of them really gave me an insight into how families lived in the 18th and 19th centuries.  The DVD looks at the following plantations:

*Shirley, Berkley, Stratford Hall (Lee Family), Mount Vernon (George Washington), Gunston Hall, Kenmore (where George Washington's sister Betty lived in Fredericksburg), Monticello (Thomas Jefferson), Ash-Lawn Highland (James Monroe), Oatlands, Arlington House and Carter's Grove.

The DVD also comes with a Bonus video that features:

*Jamestown, Colonial Williamsburg, Yorktown, Manassas, Fredericksburg and Appomattox.

Well worth my purchase.  Thank you Finley Holiday Films, I look forward to purchasing more from your store in future.

Cheers
