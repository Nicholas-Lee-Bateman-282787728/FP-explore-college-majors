8616140,5,B00FJVWGSO,it is hard to get any concert type DVD of this music group. This DVD plays on my computer but not on the two DVD players that I attempted to play it on. It also played on an apple computer. It is from Germany and takes some time to get here but the sellers are honest. Sorry this group did not do more to produce a great DVD of a single concert where they sang all of their best songs at one time and in one place. people who like this group will be satisfied with this DVD.,1430092800,5,474,3.8469387755102042
