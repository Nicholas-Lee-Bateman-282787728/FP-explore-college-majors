4128370,4,B003IY498Y,"AFTER.LIFE (yes, that is a dot between the two words suggesting this may be a video game...or blog, or something created in cyberspace)  takes a long shot; can a one-line story keep an audience's attention for over 103 minutes? Not having noticed whether this played in theaters or is one of the direct to DVD films, that question is tough to answer.  The director and writer Agnieszka Wojtowicz-Vosloo (writing in tandem with Paul Vosloo and Jakub Korolczuk) asks us to suspend belief and muse about the idea that there is  a time between 'death' and the actual burial (or other means of final interment/disposal)  when the spirit may struggle with the idea of life ending.  It is an interesting hiatus to study and fortunately a cast was selected to portray the characters involved in this internet-like game that makes it watchable.

Schoolteacher Anna Taylor (Christina Ricci) and Paul Coleman (Justin Long) are in a rocky relationship: they could be headed toward marriage but Anna has trust issues that prevent her from committing to same.  In a rage she leaves the frustrated Coleman, subsequently is killed in a car accident, and is taken to a mortuary where mortician Elliot Deacon (Liam Neeson) begins preparing her body for the funeral.  Anna is unable to move anything but her mouth and denies that she is dead, a situation Deacon encounters with most every dead body he prepares for burial. And this is where the conundrum begins: is Anna dead or is she alive, kept prisoner by Deacon?  Anna's hateful mother (Celia Watson) visits her daughter's corpse and has few kind words to say.  Paul is devastated, comforted by his colleague Tom (Josh Charles),  that Anna is dead and visits the mortuary to see the body but is refused admittance by Deacon.  One of Anna's young students Jack (Chandler Canterbury) seems to have a special affinity for the dead and spies on the mortuary where he sees Anna standing in a window. Anna and Deacon have long talks about the after.life - that time when the soul is preparing to leave the corporal body - and Deacon continues to prepare Anna for her funeral.  As she is buried the facts of the story straighten out a bit, but to reveal those facts would ruin what little suspense there is in this film.

Though the moody atmosphere is well captured by both the director of photography Anastas N. Michos and the musical score by Paul Haslinger, and the presence of Liam Neeson who plays his role very straight  and Christina Ricci who plays her role almost entirely in the nude, give the story the requisite creepy effect.  Yes, it is corny in many ways, but at least it is a bit different from the formula movies that keep churning out of Hollywood. Grady Harp, August 10",1281139200,3,2718,4.738853503184713
4128371,2,B003IY498Y,"Let me start out by saying that I don't like horror movies or any movie where the entertainment is derived from someone intentionally and repeatedly inflicting physical and/or mental pain on someone else.  I do however enjoy a good suspenseful thriller that delivers some kind of spiritual message about life and death and was hoping that this movie would be such a film.

I knew nothing about this movie (had never even heard of it - that should have raised a flag right there) and picked it up on a whim, basing my decision soley on the strength of the cast and the potential of the story line.  The cast definitely delivered (and they are why I gave this movie any stars at all), given the script with which they were working.  Liam Neeson is excellent as the undertaker.  He comes across as benevolent, caring, calming and classy.  Justin Long delivers as the tormented by guilt, well-meaning boyfriend.  And Christina Ricci is great as someone who has seemingly lost her ability to truly love and be loved.

Through the first half of the movie, I kept flip-flopping on my understanding of what was going on:  Anna is dead, but is in denial and Eliot is really a Ghost Whisperer kind of a guy, trying to help her.  Then something would happen to make me think that Eliot is a wacko, holding a very much alive Anna against her will.  Then I'd go back to my original thinking.

By the end of the movie it becomes apparent (at least to me) that Eliot is indeed a wacko.  I just don't get WHY he does what he does:  causes accidents with his white van (which apparently no one ever witnesses at the accidents), gets to the victim first, drugs them to make them appear that they're dead, receives them at his funeral home so he can mess with their minds, and then buries them alive!?!

The GOOD: Acting, setting and cinematography.
The BAD: Implausible plot, wasted potential plot developments, gratuitous nudity (although if I looked as good as Christina Ricci, I may want to show it off too), continuity issues - Anna's hair kept changing from red to brunette, and weird flashback/dream sequences that didn't enhance the story.  Here's an example of the wasted plot development: I thought that the little boy, Jack, might actually be a ghost as I'm sure I saw his picture on the wall next to Mrs. Whitehall and his mother didn't come to pick him up at school.  Jack's mother didn't react to him when he was speaking to her, but she reacted to the sound of the door slamming when he left.  But apparently Jack wasn't a ghost, so why the ghost-like set up? Just more confusion in an already confusing movie.

I was really hoping that this would be one of those movies that has an ending that ties everything together and you say to yourself, ""Man, that was incredible - how did I miss that?""  Think ""Sixth Sense"".  But no - sadly this movie just left me with a very unpleasant, flat feeling.  There was almost a glimmer of hope for this movie when it seems like Paul and Anna reunite in the afterlife at the end.  But that was quickly shattered by the last scene.  What exactly was the point to this movie?  I wish now that I hadn't rented and watched it.  :(",1281139200,20,3158,4.4868651488616464

4128374,5,B003IY498Y,"It took me quite some time to get started in writing this review. You see, ""After. Life"" is a film unlike anything I have seen in a while. This doesn't mean, in any way, that the movie in bad - on the contrary, this is an unconventional picture that defies categorization: it can be a drama or it can be a mild horror film. At any rate, ""After. Life"" is smart and engaging, an unforgettable experience.

Christina Ricci stars as Anna Taylor, a young school teacher who is apparently engaged to Paul Coleman (Justin Long), a successful lawyer. Early in the movie, we watch her attending the funeral of a former piano teacher. It is there that we meet Eliot Deacon (Liam Neeson), funeral director of the cemetery in which the burial was taking place. She later joins Paul for dinner, and he informs her about some news that made her angry. After some loud arguing, she leaves the restaurant in a rush, and takes off by herself. Predictably, she had an accident and, as a result, she dies. Next thing, she wakes up at the funeral home in which Eliot is about to prepare her body for viewing. She has scars as a result from the accident that killed her. She argues with Eliot that she is still alive, and he informs her that she suffered massive internal trauma due to the car accident, which caused her death.  He also tells her that he has the capacity to hear and talk to the dead - he ""helps the dead to make the transition."" He claims that he hears their complaints all the time, and that hers is not new. She insists that she is still alive, and Eliot tries to convince her otherwise. The story slowly develops under this premise, and the director (Agnieszka Wojtowicz-Vosloo) provides clues throughout the movie about whether or not Anna is indeed alive.

""After. Life"" is dark, as expected, yet it has a beautiful, colorful production design and photography. Christina Ricci has to be commended for the choices she makes in films - she spends half the film with no clothes on and stills delivers like the best under those presumably uncomfortable conditions.  Neeson, on the other hand, also portrays his character with restraint, given the fact that his wife in real life recently died, and he has to make a film about death. The DVD includes a making-of documentary, commentary by the director, and more. (USA, 2009, color, 103 min plus additional materials).

4128376,3,B003IY498Y,"Is Christina Ricci really dead, killed in an automobile accident, or is she being held hostage by a mad mortician (Liam Neeson) who claims that he can talk his cadavers?

That's the question posed in AFTER.LIFE, ostensibly a thriller from director Agnieszka Wojtowicz-Vosloo.

Christina thinks she's alive and so does her boy friend (Justin Long), but Neeson keeps convincing both of them that they're mistaken.

After awhile, we as an audience, stop caring one way or another.

The actors are all excellent and whereas Ms. Wojtowicz-Vosloo delivers a creepy atmosphere for her well-photographed film, she is unable to create any feeling of suspense.  Indeed, this story might have made an effective half-hour episode of TWILIGHT ZONE or a like television series, but at 103 minutes, it really overstays its welcome.

4128394,3,B003IY498Y,"**This review may contain spoilers.**

To be clear, incredible in the title isn't used in the normal sense.  I actually mean it as a comment about how unbelievable the plot is.

I stumbled across this film by going through the ""Customers Also Watched"" section of a different movie.  Frankly, I chose to watch it because the main characters are all well-known and more-than-capable actors.  If I were to go by the cover art, I'd have dismissed it and moved on.  It looked silly.

I'll break down this review in a few areas.

ACTING

As I stated, Justin, Christina, and Liam are all worthy actors, with Christina keeping it safe with the role, Liam naturally turning in a great performance, and Justin, interestingly enough, showing an extensive range.

Generally, it was a credible experience.  Liam plays a funeral director and mortician whose attitude fits his career.  He's dark, somber.  His speaking is lugubrious.  Just listening to him, you just know something sinister is amiss, and you know you can't trust him.  His on-screen time is well-used and really moves the story along, but he keeps you guessing about the exact sort of relationship he has with the deceased.  You find out just the extent of the relationship he has near the end of the movie.

Even when she was on ""Adam's Family Values,"" Christina has always been a skilled actor, with her only growing her skill level as she's gotten older.  A lot of this is because of her film choices.  She normally chooses dark roles, and they mesh well with her overall dark persona.  In this film, she embraces those past film roles and plays a dead woman, or what we think is a dead woman, damn well.  A lot of her screen time involves confusion or walking in a depressing reverie, never quite understanding, spiritually speaking, where she is.  And you follow her inquisitively to see what the end's going to be.  At times  many times, actually  shes contending with Liams character, sometimes in a violent fashion.  It all contributes to making this a good movie.

Again, Liam has the most extensive experience and is the most comfortable playing this role, or any role for that matter.  Again, he's a funeral director, and he shows that he has a curious relationship with the people he's preparing for burial.  Nothing about him gives away what his goal is.  You genuinely believe that he has a special relationship with the dead.  And when he has the big reveal near the end, you are shocked about what his real intentions are.

FILMOGRAPHY

Everything was professional.  The angles were always just right for the moment.  The scenery was appropriate for a dark film.  They really didn't do a lot of bright shots.  Although there were shots of them in the sun, for the most part, everything was dreary.  It really keeps you from rushing to try to figure out what's really happening.

PLOT

This is why I rated an otherwise great movie three stars.  The plot is good, and the dnouement is worth watching.  The ending is sad.  The problem, however, is that the plot's not logical.  I'm not suggesting that all plots have to pass the logic test; far from it.  But this film is based on duties that a funeral director would assume.  But how Liam is able to obtain death certificates for all ""clients"" but they all turn out to really be alive, just paralyzed by chemicals administered by him is nonsensical.  How they can be pronounced dead before they arrive but suddenly be alive enough to have discussions with Liam's character is ridiculous.  It appears that everyone lives in a small town.  Whoever the coroner is should be fired and tried in court for utter stupidity for the number of people he/she claims is dead.

Second, while the chemicals Liam injects his ""customers"" with can cause hallucinations and other psychotic tendencies, it wouldn't explain how his customers can look in a mirror and see themselves as deceased.  Christina did this very thing and saw a pale, sickly, morbid-looking body, which was described in perfect detail by Liam.  How is this?

Third, while Christina was being prepared, we see Liam bring in a new body and starts have a conversation with him as if that person is responding to him.  Why would he do that?  To give the impression to Christina's character that he really can speak to the dead?  Who knows?

OVERALL

It's a good film, and it'll keep you watching to the end.  The acting is good, especially from Justin, and you always feel invested in what's happening with everyone and what they're going through.  It's just problems arise when you sit and think about how plausible it is for this many people to be buried alive without a single person knowing.

Disregard the logic, and you'll find this to be a definite must-watch.",1505174400,2,4733,4.72671568627451

Justin Long plays her boyfriend who skims over the clues; man, this guy stars with a lot of incredible beauties like Alison Lohman and Lindsay Lohan.

4128488,4,B003IY498Y,"Short version: If you're going to watch a more thoughtful horror movie, this is definitely the way to go.

Synopsis: Christina Rici plays a woman killed in a car crash and Liam Neeson is the undertaker with a gift helping her cope with the fact that her life has passed her by and preparing her for burial. Justin Long plays the obsessed ex boyfriend chasing after her.

If you could package up carpe diem (""seize the day"") as a horror movie, this is a fairly good package. I wouldn't call it a horror genre ""Dead Poets Society,"" but you could do worse.

=== Spoilers ahead ===

Watching the movie initially makes clear two points: Rici's character is actually dead and Neeson's character is some ghost whisperer. There's a lot of extra work done visually to tell this story. However, if you've watched any of these movies, you probably know there's a twist coming. Lo and behold, that was all just opera and the reality is that Rici's character isn't really dead and Justin Long is going to try and save her.

PROs

The film works thanks to an excellent cast, good photography, and a good story.

* Neeson's character is supposed to be a demented, if somehow angelic grim reaper that underlines the movie's theme. In murdering Rici's character, he highlights both her failures and ours. The best scene in the whole movie is when we wonder if Neison is sincere when offering Rici the chance to walk out of the funeral home, back to her life. Would we make the same choice?

* Needless to say, Rici is gorgeous. If you like the pale skin, dark eyed goth chicks, you are not missing out. The nudity was done tastefully for the most part but I felt like it was over-emphasized more than once. I know the director was trying to celebrate her youth and sexuality while highlighting her impotence to do anything but hide in her mother's shadow, but sometimes the camera seemed to drag on her figure. I suspect few will complain.

* The real winner of the movie is Justin Long's performance. If they'd selected an actor you weren't both rooting for and angry with, the movie wouldn't have worked. Kudos both to him and the director for hitting the right tone on something that could have easily gone off the rails into tedium or raw heroism.

CONs

* Red Herring Hallucinations - these really dead threw off the story's believability. I understand that this had to fit a horror convention of keeping the viewer guessing, but I wonder if it would have been more profound and drawn repeat viewings as you watch that inner play.  Perhaps a movie that talks about death, life, and meaning, and skips the false mystical dressing? Thought it could have easily swayed into Art House with too much philosophical and conversation-based content, a final scene where Rici's character is unable to leave the room would have been much more compelling with flashbacks to a life un-lived life rather than some weird ritualistic burial vision. It's a tough call that really lays with the producer rather than director.

* Creepy Kid Fail - I groaned a bit with the child they cast to follow in Neeson's character's footsteps. He mysteriously picks up on Neeson's ""gift"" and then gradually gets converted over into his obsession. There are some good, young actors out there with just a bit of nuance that could have added quite a bit of color to the film, with that much more tragedy and fear. As it was, I could probably best describe him as ""able to remember his lines"".",1423094400,,3448,4.632786885245902

The cover and premise promise something really original and different, but AFTER LIFE doesn't entirely deliver on that promise. Still, it should more or less appeal to fans of horror and/or Christina Ricci. It's suspenseful but often draggy, with a few fairly decent surprises. As you've probably guessed, this film is really grim and humorless with a number of vagaries. AFTER LIFE begins to touch on several concepts which are never completely fleshed-out (no pun intended) and don't always fit in with the rest of its plot, which is dissatisfying. There are also some interesting spiritual nuances and overtones--references to Jesus's ability to raise the dead, etc--which, again, could have really enhanced this with more development. Though it's basically interesting, AFTER LIFE is one of those films where the makers were obviously unsure of how to build the story and where to take it. Much is left entirely up to the viewer's interpretation. It would be hard to reveal what-all is going on here without being ruinous, but it seems they could have tried a little harder.",1374105600,,1102,5.156424581005586

4128523,3,B003IY498Y,"What is hugely disappointing about this film is that it's a really good idea for a story, and it's not badly implemented, but it could be a much better film if they had kept you questioning even after the end of the film - I'm trying SO hard not to ruin the ending - and it would have been easy to make it that little bit creepier. The script writing is a little poor at the start of the film, it made me think that this was going to turn out to be a terrible film, but once they get into the story the writing and acting greatly improves.

For Christina Ricci fans it's a good film to have, and if you're a fan of her looks you'll be pleased to know that she spends the vast majority of this film either in a flimsy red silk nightdress or totally naked. Good for Liam Neeson fans too, his performance is great as always. I'd say it's never going to be a favourite film, but it's not a bad film to watch. or buy.",1373414400,,912,3.9836065573770494

4128531,3,B003IY498Y,"I saw this on tv and I missed the first part.  The part when I started watching was when Anna was in the funeral home, wakes up and wants to know what she's doing there. The funeral director tells her she is dead and he is there to help her accept her death and make the transition.  To help her...he does absolutely nothing, but put her down. When she says she can't be dead because she is breathing, he angrily says, ""You people!! Just because you're breathing, you think you're alive!"" (Or something to that effect.) He seems to despise dead people that he claims to have so much compassion for and want to help them to the other side. He always refers to them as ""You people!!"" He also is very negative: ""There is nothing left for you here.""

Spoilers:
However, I never thought she was dead. She was whacking things around, and the funeral director, Deacon, did not like this at all. He didn't like that she got up and walked around and argued with him. He seemed to have so much vested interest in her being dead, that I never believed anything he said. Deacon also became extremely nervous any time anyone else was around Anna. So I believed that she was alive and he was trying to make her think that she was dead, so that he could kill her and bury her, because he really liked doing that sort of thing.  The funeral home was in a creepy old mansion (which would have been good in an old scary movie), and he lived there also.  He had a bunch of photos of ""dead"" people on his bedroom wall that he talked to. He believed he was doing something useful in killing these people (or maybe he just enjoyed it and rationalized it as useful) because in  his opinion they weren't really living, and they were just taking up space that could be better used by people who really did want to live. And he, Eliot Deacon, is the one who got to decide all this.  Clearly a psychopathic egomaniac.

The movie itself was not that great. Deacon would come into the room where the ""dead"" people were lying on metal gurneys, and kind of just walk around and not do very much. Not sure what his purpose was there.  He always locked the door, and it showed him turning down the thermostat to 40 degrees. It showed this several times, so apparently it got turned up again somehow.

Anna's boyfriend Paul, who she manages to call on a rotary phone, appears to not be able to understand her. He becomes upset thinking it's a prank call. I guess he didn't have caller ID. (Deacon tells her no one can hear her but him.) Sometimes Paul thinks she's still alive and sometimes he thinks she's dead. He talks to the cops about it and they are very rude to him and treat him like a child. Even though one of them went to see his ""dead"" brother and saw Anna move. He apparently was too stupid for that to register in his brain.

There is also a weird kid, Jack, who is one of Anna's students, and who sees her standing in her red slip in the window (with Deacon trying to convince her that she is dead).  Deacon convinces Jack that he also has the gift that Deacon has, which is to speak to the dead and help them on their way out of this life. He told him the first was his mother. So did Deacon kill his mother because she wasn't really living anyway?

Anna gets brainwashed, without much effort, into thinking that she is dead. Deacon does keep shooting her up with stuff though, apparently making her weak and docile.  She never gets hungry and she never has to go to the bathroom. Still, in the back of her mind, she has that belief that she really is alive. When he offers her the chance to go see her boyfriend and tell him that she does love him, she can barely walk. Suddenly she is having some nightmare vision that a bunch of witch-like women are spitting on her and Paul is just standing there watching. Maggots come out of her mouth.  Anna quickly hurries back to her gurney and hops on. Deacon jeers at her that he knew she didn't have the guts.

A lot of it makes no sense, but maybe it's to knock some sense into you. Jack is a budding killer (starting out with animals) who will now decide who lives and dies, since Deacon told him he can. Deacon has the perfect profession for it.  Apparently I missed the part where he causes accidents with his van, in order to get clients.

So if you are ever in this situation, and think you are alive, but somebody tells you you are dead, take for granted that they have their own agenda, and get the hell out!",1364947200,2,4443,4.275327771156138

4128533,2,B003IY498Y,"Some movies you know nothing about going into them and that's how best to view them. This is one of those movies.

Anna (Christina Ricci) has a mundane life. Her relationship with Paul (Justin Long) makes him happy but no longer seems to resonate with her at all. She is most at ease teaching at grade school, where her favorite student is the unusual and compassionate Jack (Chandler Canterbury). That particular day she must leave early for a funeral and on the way there, makes a spontaneous choice to have her hair dyed red. Afterward, she meets up with Paul at a restaurant, where he intends to propose but his bungled conversation beforehand convinces her that he intends to break up with her and she storms out of the restaurant in a rage. Refusing to listen to his side of the story, she cranks up the audio in her car and drives off into a storm.

The next thing she knows, Anna is waking up in the morgue where the gentle, mild-mannered but slightly sinister mortician, Eliot (Liam Neeson), informs her that she is dead. Everyone dies, and most of them don't believe it at first. They continue to fight to survive but their time grows short. He would like Anna to come to terms with her death, release her hold over the living, and enter the afterlife. He is the only one who can hear and see her, communicate with her. Anna is reluctant to believe him but cannot explain her situation otherwise. In the meantime, Paul attempts to come to terms with her death but cannot shake the feeling that she may still be alive. So which is it? Is she dead... or is she alive and in the hands of a twisted psychopath? Believe it or not, this film keeps you guessing right until the end -- and it concludes on a slightly ambiguous note. If you like straight out answers this will frustrate you, even though in my opinion the conclusion is made fairly obvious through the concluding evidence of the final scenes.

I love movies that really mess with your mind and this one does. It would have me convinced one moment that she was dead, the next it would raise some serious questions that made me doubt my earlier conclusion. In purely mind-bender terms, this one of the best scripts I have seen and if it has one flaw, it is that some of its illogical loop-holes aren't explained (at least, on screen... we are free to draw our own conclusions). It kept me riveted from beginning to end and after reaching the conclusion, I kind of wanted to watch it all over again. Therefore it pains me to say that there is no way I can recommend this film, because it is very casual about its nudity -- and there is a lot of it. The opening credits is the camera following the naked curves of a beautiful woman; the opening scene shows Paul and Anna having sex (she is bored by it); we see her breasts. She takes a shower; we see her shapely outline through the shower door. Later on, clothes are cut off her, clothes are put on her (always with breast nudity), she spends a portion of the film nude in the morgue (often interacting with Eliot, which is just creepy) and the camera framing shows us a lot more of her than I ever wanted to see. There's no full frontal nudity but some backside. Paul has a nightmare about her in which he discovers that while in the shower, she has ripped out her own heart -- she stands holding it in one hand, while blood flows down from the incision in her bare chest. While covered by a sheet, and unconscious, she is peeked at by a male visitor to the morgue. She spends much of the movie in only a short red silk slip.

There are about a dozen f-words, four uses of GD, two of Jesus' name, and a handful of references to s***. One thing that may offend Christian viewers is that when explaining his gift to someone, Eliot says that he's like Jesus -- who could also communicate with and raise the dead. Violence is limited to some eerie sequences in the morgue that never amount to anything; Anna threatens Eliot with a knife and scissors. A man hits a child (earning him the horror of passerby), a man assaults another man and shoves him into a wall, there are implications of car accidents, and on occasion gaping wounds that are sewn up (graphically). A man is stabbed with an embalming implement in order to drain him of blood. There are some especially creepy, symbolic, and frightening nightmare scenes in which Anna imagines being buried alive (maggots crawl out of her mouth), being surrounded by creepy-looking mourners, and accosted by other dead people. Either decision you make toward the end, the outcome is morbid.

Acting-wise, this film is stellar. Liam Neeson is brilliant as a man who you are unsure of, who scares you and at the same time makes you feel almost ""safe"" in his presence. I know that does not make any sense, but it's true. You like him. You feel for him. But there is something about him that you cannot entirely trust. The kid is fantastic and Christina has never impressed me more. I really, really wish this film had been more about building the continuing suspense rather than lingering on her naked body. There is a difference between atmosphere and intentional provocative material and from the shots they chose to incorporate, it's clear they went for the latter.

Ok, so many have been a bit confused on weather Anna (Ricci) is dead or alive.  SHE IS VERY MUCH ALIVE!

About The Mortician - He feels it is his ""duty"" to take ""ungrateful people"" off of this planet.  He gives them 3 days to come to terms that they are ""dead"" and to see what they ""did wrong in life"".  He then buries them alive.

*** CLUES TO WATCH FOR ***

1. Several scenes go to his photographs of all the people he has buried, some you will notice have closed eyes and others (most) have open eyes,  the ones with open eyes are people who were not dead and the ones with closed eyes had died and gone through all the normal ""funeral"" stuff.

2.  You will notice (or not, maybe I did because I work in funeral service) that he NEVER does any ""preparation"" of her body (ie: embalm, etc), this is given in clues by the following - you never see him doing it on her and there are no marks from the tools we use in prep.

3.  You also notice that he has to keep her locked in the preparation room so that she can not get out.

4.  Another on is, you see his white van behind her in the accident scene because he picked her up from the accident without a doctor ever seeing her (that is what he does with all his ""dead"", you will also notice him parked on the side of the road with the boyfriends accident), this is how he gets his prey.

5.  He keeps his ""dead"" dead like by using the injections of Hyrdo. in order to put the person in a dead like state (he tells them it is to relax their muscles and prevent rigor from setting in).  You will notice him look at his watch when the mother comes to see Anna because the solution only works for so long and he has to time it just right.  In the beginning of the movie you will notice that the dead man teacher exhales a breath as Anna (Ricci) is observing him in the casket, that is because his solution is starting to wear off.

6.  The student Jake see his very alive teacher Anna in the window of the funeral home (after she tries to escape), the mortician tells the boy that he has the same ""gift"" as him and then decides to train his protege to do what he is doing (you will see this towards the ending of the show).

Christina Ricci also did well for the material given, and as always, was beyond hot.  Lots of her throughout nude, if you're into that.  The ending is rather predictable, and throughout you are kept guessing to as to what really is going on.  Some of it didn't really make sense...like (spoiler) was she hallucinating on drugs, dreaming, dead and seeing ghosts or what?  That never really got a total answer, but I'd get it was the stuff injected into her.  It is surely watchable once, and with Christina in it flaunting her stuff, good for a second go-around for visuals only.

That's the source of suspense in the film, and it's not bad...but eventually, especially before the end credits, you might want to have that cleared up for us.

But I don't think it does.  And that seriously frustrates anyone who invests any caring at all in this film.

The one really good part of the movie: if you want to see Christina Ricci naked, you've hit pay dirt.  She spends quite a bit of time naked on the slab as Liam prepares her for her funeral.

After pondering this question for some time, I think I finally figured it out. [NOTE: SPOILER ALERT FROM HERE ON IN MY REVIEW.]  But first, I want to say that I thought the movie was very well done. It had very realistic sets (esp. the mortuary), and the actors were superb--all top flight professionals and the big names, Christina Ricci and Liam Neeson, give grade A+ performances.  Neeson has that calm, if somewhat morbid demeanor that you expect in an undertaker. Ricci was excellent in her role as a somewhat troubled young woman who meets an untimely end; she was still so young and still had so much of life to figure out and live.  But this is why I believe she was really dead.  She had a fatal car crash! (As does her boyfriend at the end.) I think what the movie really depicts is what the thoughts of someone in Ricci's circumstances would have to say, and do if they could, once they meet their untimely end.  Of course the mechanism in the movie for this is Neeson's ""special ability"" to communicate with the dead (without that we would have no plot).  So, dear friends,the lesson the movie also shows is that we should live life to the fullest so that we won't have any last regrets like poor Christina's character did.",1332979200,,1348,4.549586776859504

I will watch just about anything and I found myself starting to play games on my phone half-way through. No ""thriller"" aspect whatsoever.

Casting? Christina Ricci is perfect for the creepy, pale, dead girl role and she did a good job. Liam Neeson, not so much. If you want to see a good Liam Neeson movie, check out one of his action flicks (Taken, Unknown) - he is much better in that role.

Then there is the ending. I still do not understand what happened. I was able to follow ""Inception"" (for those of you that saw it, this makes sense) but I can't follow ""After. Life""? Who knows.

4128564,2,B003IY498Y,"I am going to discuss the thriller for and by nudists, After. Life.

Here's the gist...Christina Ricci is a school teacher who is full of ennui and malaise. She takes pills and dates Justin Long and generally has a pouty vacant look on her face all the time, which we all know is the visual depiction of depression in moviedom. Christina Ricci is cold and mean to Justin Long but he is just so infatuated with that ""Precious Moments"" face of hers, he has to fight for the love. The love that is painfully absent and never really existed in the first place if flashbacks are to be believed. Oh yeah, Christina Ricci also has a creepy student who is apparently supposed to be the love child of Danny from The Shining.

Anywho, depression and pills and the hysteria that comes with her lady parts causes Christina Ricci to get in an accident because we all know ladies can't drive. The next thing we know, Christina Ricci wakes up on a slab to Liam Neeson, the town's funeral director/mortician/creeper, leering over her and telling her she died in the accident. And Christina Ricci is all like ""Whuuuut?! Nuh uh!"" and Liam Neeson is like ""For real. Now I have to cut your clothes off so you can be naked for the next 90 minutes.""

And that's it. The suspense for the rest of the film hinges on whether Liam Neeson is telling truth about Christina Ricci's new status as dead-but-sexy zombie-ghost or if she is actually alive and Qui Gonn is just a psycho.

This film certainly asks you to make some leaps of logic. Like whatever town this is has the most inept emergency responders ever. This accident, which is supposed to be the worst car accident in the history of the world, results in Christina Ricci having a cut on her forehead. That's it. No bruises. No broken bones. Just a cut. On her forehead. Obviously, when the police and EMTs showed up, the rookie took one look at her and puked while the grizzled veteran said something like ""Poor bastard."" before they put her in a body bag and handed her over to the Nees. Or how about how Liam Neeson keeps injecting Christina Ricci with 10,000 CCs of ""muscle relaxer"" to prevent ""rigor""? Either Christina Ricci's school district has the laxest hiring requirements ever or she faked some credentials somewhere along the line because she is the dumbest teacher ever to fall for that bunk.

This proves to be the undoing of the film. The filmmakers keep making it seem pretty obvious which way this thing is going to turn out but then throw in these inexplicable ""or is it?"" moments that make you reevaluate your previous assumptions. That's all well and good to keep the suspense going but the whole fun of these movies is the reveal at the end where they tell you what is really going on. That never comes in this movie. They just keep making u-turns on the path through the whole damn thing, to the very last frame. LAME.

Liam Neeson gives a good performance and the film does have flashes of quality in it but it is ultimately disappointing. Justin Long is not charming or likable at all. Christina Ricci phones in her performance and let's her boobs do the talking on the other end of the line. I had high hopes but it was a disappointment.",1315353600,5,3193,4.515570934256055
4128565,5,B003IY498Y,"Yes there are plot holes, yes there are quite a few things in this movie that probably wouldn't happen in real life but then again I think that is why they call this a movie and not REALITY. I truly enjoyed this movie and thought it was pretty well done, maybe not the best movie of all time but most certainly not as terrible as it is made out to be. Let's be fair here and examine just a few gripes with the movie.
First of all this movie is NOT a documentary, if you wanted to see how real dead bodies are examined then watch Dr. G THIS is not your movie. I am extremely sorry that you can't take something for what it is.
Second is the plot holes, yes chances are that the body would go through WAY more examination to get to a mortuary table than just a few coroners and a quick medical examination but to be fair we are told that this is a small town and we are also made aware that Liam Niesson's character is fairly well liked and respected in the town. So would it really be out of the realm of possibility for him to have connections within the coroners office and or from medical examiners on the scene? What is the motivation? well it could be anything. I hope people do know that Morticians make quite a deal of money for what they do. Is it out of the realm of possibility to say that he could be bribing the medical examiner and coroner just so he could get his very sick jollies? I don't think so. Yeah the twist really wasn't all that well veiled but then again it wasn't all that poorly done either.
I won't bore you with too much detail and give away too much but overall I would have to say that this is a refreshing look at the horror genre that has been on the slab for years. It's definitely not perfect but it's something new and different for a dying genre. If you can put yourself in the position of the character it is a very suspenseful movie with a lot of great imagery. My gripe is that it is extremely long and I thought it would have been better had it been shorter which may not have given the story AS much development but probably would have been better for those with short attention spans that need to watch things explode every 5 minutes. It does get a little muddled but I can say this film has a lot of character and redeemable qualities.",1314662400,2,2278,4.144469525959368
4128566,3,B003IY498Y,Well I thought it was so so. Not very gory and not very scarey but mildly amusing. AS usual Christina looked as beautiful as ever. I thought the story tended to ramble a little.,1314403200,,177,4.235294117647059
4128567,5,B003IY498Y,"The content of this film is in the journey, not in the destination. Once again its all a matter of taste I suppose, but like the Masterful film THE BOX where the content is in the dialogue, this film has its moments in the dialogue, and if you miss the text/sub-text and/or pre-text ( however you want to interpret it ) the film is an exploration of how someone can be alive but dead to the possibilities of their own world.
  The director invents her own version of Succinylcholine for the purpose  of the movie conceit, but Liam plays the Psycho character to the hilt and uses it to justify his treatment of people who are ""alive but dead"".The way you view Ricci's nudity Depends on wether you see Ricci's character as resigning herself to being dead, or resigning herself to Liam's Character telling her she is dead, and so Ricci's character has dropped all defenses against the world ( and in the beginning of the film, the defenses against her boyfriend, the Justin Long Character).Either way the attitude is one of a corpse by definition.
  The level of structured interpretation comes close to the way Verhoeven  sees Total Recall in the main commentary, and the way the Cube ( Vincenzo Natali) is perceived in its rarified ""beingness"".For a first film, After Life is a fairly good attempt at an ambiguous interpretative event. The key to what happens in this film is in the commentary, and shows the layers the director is aiming for in the story. So, visually superb, and stunningly crafted, watch the film, and listen to the commentary, see if she has gained what she aimed for. I think she mostly has achieved her aim. For me, it was worth a long wait to get the film.
  Wether you are going to focus on the titillating factor, or what the Director sees as the central scene, her starting point in the writing process, the chill is in what you reply if you ask yourself the question that the director poses about the exchange between Liam and Christina on Liam's Characters ""Altar"" ; How would YOU feel, what would YOU answer.",1311465600,2,2037,4.59228650137741
4128568,1,B003IY498Y,"This is a horrible movie where the only remotely redeeming value is the generous exposure of Christina Ricci's nude body (although it's not that sexy since it's in the context of her laying nude on a morgue's gurney).

She plays a not so likeable teacher who is okay during her day job but overly disturbed in her personal life. She gets in a car accident and ends up in Liam Neeson's funeral home. He's a total weirdo who thinks he can talk to the dead because the dead do not really know that they are dead. All he does is ""put away and arrange things"" throughout the movie (it's so rampant and overdone that I found it comical).

The concept of the movie was is she or is she not dead? Frankly, I wanted to kill myself watching this garbage...and it is truly smoldering, rotting, stinky, festering garbage!

These actors must have only been in this for the paycheck. Ricci lays on a gurney naked, gets up walks around a little bit and then gets back on the gurney. Neeson just tends to things and rambles about how certain people don't really live their life anyway. Ricci's boyfriend ,Justin Long, has the dumbest role of being a worry wart about Ricci... even though she was a terrible girlfriend to him and running all over the place checking on her (he seems to be typecast with this role...see ""Drag Me to Hell"").

The good:

* Storyline - Is Anna Taylor (Christina Ricci) dead or alive. Keeps you guessing even after the conclusion
* Plot - Does the caretaker have special powers to bring the dead alive or is he seeing ghost that have the ability to interact with the real world.  Is the little boy dead or alive?
* Characters - Christina Ricci's character was developed enough that I cared about her.  I sort of cared about her boyfriend.  I cared about the little boy.  The caretaker, not so much.  The caretaker already seemed like he was dead inside.  A little boy's mother had too much of a ghost look on her face.  The paraplegic mother reminded me of some of the people in my life that I really don't like.

The bad:

* Slow progression - Takes forever for the storyline to get anywhere
* Low Climax - Don't expect a major climax.  Small anti-climax.  Just kind of expect it to be there.
* Little Action - Nothing really happens.  It's more about the story.
* The ending - It just kind of ends and leaves those to wander.

4128573,4,B003IY498Y,"A very different take on the 'buried alive' theme in horror that goes back centuries, ""After.life"" stars Cristina Ricci as a young schoolteacher who 'dies' in a freak automobile accident only to wake up alive and well in the town morgue.  Where she promptly meets the mortician/funeral parlor director (played by Liam Neeson), a haunted, weary man who explains to her that she is indeed deceased, the latest of a long line of deceased he's encountered who don't know they're dead, and because of his unique ability to see and interact with the dead, it's his job to prepare her for her imminent journey to the afterlife.

  What's real?  Is this scenario the truth, with Neeson a conductor of souls, or is he nuts or worse and Ricci is still alive, captive?  It sounds like this kind of scenario should fall apart in anything longer than a 20-minute segment of an anthology film but, surprisingly, it doesn't.  With great skill and suspense, it genuinely keeps the viewer guessing even as it keeps Ricci's character guessing.  She's initially convinced that the funeral home director is insane and she's very much alive, but begins to doubt.  The movie will throw a clue that indicates one conclusion, then minutes later throw a different hint that leads you back in the other direction.  All this while, Ricci's boyfriend (played by Justin Long), haunted by suspicions after one of her grade school students insists he's seen her alive, begins to search out whether something strange is going on, and wonders whether all his doubts are just the byproduct of grief and the guilt he's feeling over the fight they had the night of her death.

That being, the storyline is normally quite easy to understand requiring very little effort on the part of the viewers to actually think or grasp the events taking place on screen, but they are always entertaining and keep me watching nonetheless.  Plus Christina Ricci *is* quite the beautiful woman, and it's strange how her face (and her body, hehe) never seems to grow older.

Now what's especially worth noting about After. Life is that I was almost 100% totally convinced about 30 minutes before the conclusion that I knew exactly where the storyline was going.  It seemed like all the clues were headed in one particular direction.  To put it lightly, there is definitely a HUGE surprising twist at the very end that totally left me floored.  I did not see... *that* coming, hehe.  I won't dare spoil it though, and hopefully nobody else writing this review spoiled it either.

Anyway yeah, the storyline.  It's amazingly creepy because I believe for most people death is quite the difficult subject.  Difficult to grasp or understand, and just plain difficult to deal with.  It's about a girl who either believes she's dead or really is dead (I won't dare tell which one!) thanks to the old man playing the part of a funeral home worker (Liam Neeson, the second most popular character in the film next to Ricci's character) who's pretty warped and likes to fill Ricci's head with really bizarre things that nearly make the poor girl crazy.  Let's just leave it at that so as not to accidentally spoil anything storyline-related, hehe.

Overall, solid acting, a performance by Justin Long that finally DOES feel believable and pretty good, and just a really twisted take on the ever fascinating subject of death.

I know this was probably done on purpose(to throw us off the trail), but in the end it just makes for a confusing mess that leaves you less than satisfied.

Like so many child actresses before her (Anne Hathaway, Alyssa Milano, to name a few), this is a ""coming of age"" movie where Christina Ricci sheds her innocent adolescent guise.  How does she do that?  you ask.  Same way as Anne & Alyssa before her:  she traipses around nude for much of the movie.  Of course, this is not something I'm going to complain about ~ she has an exquisite body.  Even made out to be as pale as a corpse she STILL looks fantasic!

For me, the organic core of this movie seems to be a sort of tribute to the darkest fear of Edgar Allen Poe:  being buried alive.  Few things are more disturbing than the thought of ""waking up"" in your coffin with zero chance of escape.

She certainly has some talent in some areas so I won't sell her too short, but my thrusts at After. Life as a movie are at targets that are almost all directorial in essence.  Besides that what the hell is the deal with the dot between after and life in the film's title anyway?

After. Life follows Anna (Christina Ricci), who dies in a car accident after a fight with her boyfriend Paul (Justin Long).  Or does she?  Funeral home proprietor Eliot (Liam Neeson) would have her believe that she is dead, but how on Earth can he be a credible source when he's telling her this and she's supposed to be dead?  Anyway, Paul freaks out because he can't see her one last time and some twists I won't spoil unfold from there.

Liam Neeson is great here but he's miscast and equipped with both the film's best dialogue and the film's worst.  He pulls off slumming it quite nicely as only truly great actors can.  Justin Long is either hit or miss with me and here he stinks, but Celia Weston is great as Anna's cold but grieving mother.  Then there is Christina Ricci.  I love Christina Ricci.  I think she is simply put the very best American actress at turning caricatures we should despise into lovable human beings.  She had great roles as a child, teenager, and stunted adolescent in movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Addams-Family/dp/B000FIHN52/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Addams Family</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pumpkin/dp/B00005JLD1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pumpkin</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monster/dp/B00005JMUK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monster</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Man-Who-Cried/dp/B00005R87R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Man Who Cried</a>, among others.

Her turn as Anna in After. Life simply does not work and the movie relies heavily on her performance.  It's crazy because before this movie I would've swooned that she should be playing Catwoman in Nolan's next Batman project instead of Anne Hathaway.  Perhaps her next feature will prove that her performance here was more about casting and direction than her acting chops, but Neeson survived so that might be a stretch.  Oh well, hey, at least she's naked again.",1297036800,,3450,6.251585623678647
4128588,4,B003IY498Y,"""After. Life"" is a unique viewing experience for fans of horror movies or anyone looking for a film with plenty of twists and mystery.  With actors such as Liam Neeson, Justin Long, and Christina Ricci, the film does contain a high quality set of actors that deliver their roles and emotions perfectly.  The story is graphic and full of mystery.  However, this is where the problem of the film begins: it's plot is two-sided, trying to play with the minds of the viewers on two different levels.

Advertised as a ""supernatural horror"" film, ""After. Life"" tries to balance two different plot lines at the same time.  The story begins with an elementary teacher named Anna (Christina Ricci) who seems unsatisfied in her relationship with Paul (Justin Long).  She never appears interested in anything that Paul has to say, and it's quite obvious to the audience that the couple is having relationship problems.  After depicting the two of them in bed with one another, the film quickly cuts away to Anna at work, where a little boy seems to be a complete outcast from the class and from his own family.  The boy's name is Jack, and his only friend seems to be his teacher Anna.

Anna has to leave for a funeral for her deceased music teacher and Jack wants to tag along to see his first funeral in person.  Anna persuades the child to go home, even though his mother is shown simply watching television in a trance, unaware of the existence of her own child as he comes home.  Once Anna arrives at the funeral, she meets the funeral director, Eliot Deacon (Liam Neeson).  Deacon appears to be fascinated with Anna.  She leaves the funeral home and goes to meet Paul for dinner.

After Paul announces that he received a job offer in Chicago and would be moving, Anna goes into a fit of rage and storms out of the restaurant.  In her chaotic state of mind, she gets in a car crash and is pronounced dead on the scene.  The film cuts to the next scene, showing Anna lying on the metal gurney in the basement of the funeral home.  Anna's controlling and heartless mother blames Paul and appears unfazed by the sight of her dead daughter.

Here's where the film tries to play to two different plot lines at once.  It appears as if Anna is not dead, seeing how she is capable of walking and talking, yet it seems as if only Deacon is capable of hearing her.  Paul does not think that Anna is dead, and is in a desperate struggle to prove that Deacon is not the man everyone thinks he is.  The film tries to make the audience think that Anna is in fact dead and that Deacon is the only character capable of speaking to her, while at the same time making the audience think that perhaps she isn't dead at all.

The film's plot is quite difficult to understand at first, but with subtle hints here and there, it becomes clear what the truth about Anna's state of being truly is.  Liam Neeson does a great job of playing a role that feels quite out of character for man usually enlisted for roles in films like ""Taken"", ""Batman Begins"", ""Star Wars"" and ""The A-Team"".  However, he does a great job of portraying a dark, twisted character in a very convincing manner.  At times Liam makes Deacon into a character that the audience may feel sympathy towards, while in other scenes he is displays a creepy demeanor that can send chills down the viewer's spine with his actions.  The director and writer tried to make both sides of the plot feasible, however, this leads to a lot of distractions and confusion for the audience, and a second viewing is probably the best manner in which one can fully comprehend the film in its entirety.

Some plot holes hold back the film from being truly spectacular, such as when Deacon is told to by Anna's mother to dye Anna's her back to its natural brown color, there are still scenes afterwards in which Anna is shown having red hair despite the fact that the film already had Deacon dye it back to brown.  These are details that the director probably should have paid more attention to when filming, but it's a minor annoyance more than anything else.

Overall, the story of ""After. Life"" will keep the audience on their toes, guessing at every turn what will happen next.  Is Anna really dead and Deacon has the special ability to speak the deceased, as he suggests or is something deeper and more gruesome occurring?  ""After. Life"" is a film with enough suspense and mystery to warrant multiple viewings, all of which will provide further insight on the happenings of the story, making it even better as it begins to expand with each successive viewing session.  An excellent film with a dark, haunting ambience, powerful plot, and superior acting.  ""After. Life"" is worth checking out.",1296518400,,4712,4.564803804994055
4128589,4,B003IY498Y,"I saw this movie for the first time today (01/26/11 on cable) at 4am.  What woke me up, I don't know.  But, this movie kept me awake for the next 103 minutes - and had me very confused until the very end.  With the movie still fresh on my mind, I came to Amazon to see what my fellow reviewers had to say about the film (read the ""spoilers"" too)!  I really didn't put it together until the very last scene, when Justin's character gets his on the mortician's table.  In my opinion, both were very much alive when they arrived there.  One scene I found strange (until now), was the fact that when Ricci's character called Long's character, her speech was so garbled to as appear unintelligible.  At first, I thought to myself, ""a voice of the dead?""  But, then, it hit me.  The relaxing/paralyzing drugs that he administered to her - and WHERE he administered them - right in the throat!  In her mind, she'd make perfect sense in her speech, but in reality, all Long's character would hear is an unintelligent, garbled hub-bub of a one way conversation.  But, again, that didn't hit me until 12 hours after watching the movie.  As I had said earlier with Long's character - Neeson's character wasted NO TIME with him and took him straight away!

Conclusion:  The mortician was a ""freakin'"" psycopathic nut-job!!  But, he did have people there that were ""really"" dead, for they said not a word.  Credit Ricci's character for having the will to struggle, to reach for life, but in the end, it was all in what was left inside their minds!

This movie has affected me enough that most likely, I will NOT buy it, but I commend the director, cast and crew for making the most of what they had to work with.  In the end, it was a thought-provoking film that forced you to use your brain to keep up!

I rate ""After. Life:"" 4 stars!

I recommend you see it - judge for yourself!",1296000000,2,1868,4.406432748538012
4128590,3,B003IY498Y,"Having never heard of this movie, I rented it based on the acting talent. I didn't know what it was about or heard any reviews so didn't expect anything, really. Liam Neeson plays a funeral director who has a ""gift"" of being able to speak to the newly dead. Christina Ricci is his latest ""body"", Justin Long her boyfriend with whom she's having trouble. After a fight, Ricci is involved in a car accident and finds her on the slab at Neesons funeral home.

The twist is that you really don't know if Ricci is alive or dead. Neeson plays a lovely balance of creepy and endearing making you second guess what is going on right to the end of the movie. It's nice to see Long as a character totally different than what he usually plays, and he plays it very convincingly. Ricci plays pretty much the same character she always does, her acting range isn't very wide in my personal opinion, but I enjoyed her performance all the same. Her look and style are perfect for this genre.

There is quite a lot of nudity in it, but honestly, I was surpirsed there wasn't more seeing as she is supposedly a dead body getting ready for burial.

Is it the best thriller out there, no. Is it perfect? No. But it was surprising in its ability to give you enough clues to keep you guessing but not give away the ending.",1295740800,,1300,4.341563786008231
4128591,2,B003IY498Y,"In the thriller ""After. Life"" (not ""Afterlife""), directed and co-written by Agnieszka Wojtowicz-Vosloo, Christina Ricci plays Anna Taylor, a twenty-something schoolteacher who, after a car accident in the rainy night, finds herself in a funeral home of a morgue director Eliot Deacon (Liam Neeson). There Mr. Deacon calmly informs Anna that she is dead - even though she thinks she is still alive.

Just before the accident Anna had quarreled with her boyfriend Paul (Justin Long), who suspects that the local mortician has been hiding something from him. In the meanwhile, Anna attempts to ""escape"" from the basement room (her body still functions, it seems), ignoring what Eliot said, but one disturbing question is ... he might be really telling her truth.

Not a bad idea for a supernatural / psychological thriller, but ""After. Life"" fails to deliver the goods. The problem with the film is simple. With its confusing narrative and flat characters, the film really does not know what it wants to be. A thought-provoking drama about life and death? A melodrama about two lovers? A quasi-supernatural thriller with twists and turns? Even those who are attracted to its premise (and I found it pretty interesting) will find the story too illogical to be taken seriously.

More importantly, the film suffers under the weight of its own ambitions - or in short, pretentiousness. While it seems that ""After. Life"" thinks its conclusion very clever and even insightful, the fact is most audiences feel cheated or short-changed. What the meaning of her nose bleeding? What happened to her cell phone message? Also, the director heavily relies on clichd devices in following the twist-ridden storyline. ""After. Life"" keeps tantalizing us until the end for no other purpose than doing so.",1295568000,4,1783,5.141379310344828

to add my two cents.

Personally, I found this movie engaging from beginning to end, with a story that
is not a retelling of something I have already seen.  Personally, I like a good
ambiguous horror story and this one fits the bill.  Even after watching it (but
before watching the commentary) I found myself wondering what the ""real"" story
was.  The director;s commentary and a featurette do give it away, though there
are still several plot points that are not really explained that leave one wondering
exactly how the events could have taken place.

Since the plot is already pretty well outlined above, there is little point in repeating
the details here.  All I can say is that I found the performances good and the
story interesting enough to make me want to watch both the movie and the

There were 3 scenes (maybe about 4-5 mins each) that were almost hitting that ""spark"" and then they fade back to her laying on the morgue table...juuuust laying. I almost think that this was more of a directoral issue, because honestly the idea of what the movie is played on is a great structure. Oh well. I would suggest this to people just to hear what there thought on it are. It's definately not a terrible movie, it just lacks what make Hollywood famous. The only part I didn't like were the last 8-15 minutes or so, there really isn't a conclusion, and it left me feeling ""Really? I just watched this for 2 hours for that?""

You must have a brian in your head to appreciate this one....the plot line is NOT spoon feed to you as it is in most Hollywood films.

Yes the viewer is often wondering if the characters are alive or dead, but they are also wondering if something much more sinister is taking place.

That's what makes this film so intriguing.  Lots of questions are raised, and none completely answered.  The viewer is left to draw their own conclusions, which may require more than one viewing.

Giving the fine performances of Liam Neeson, Justin Long (one of his best performances), and Christina Ricci, additional viewings are a pleasure.

But the film does not work in terms of creating a tense, suspensful atmosphere - and that is not due to the lack of creepy effects, nor is it due to lack of trying. It fails because it assumes that a dark, dismal setting combined with repetitive spoken dialogue is tantamount to a tightly constructed story; one which maximizes the talents of the cast by developing the characters. Early in the film, the directors and writers waste that opportunity to a large degree. Basically the story develops around two struggling young lovers who have their own demons (which are never fully explained). After a fight, Ricci appears to die in a car accident. When in the morgue, her corpse awakens and begins to have dialogue with the mortician (Neeson) who we are told has some special power of external perception. In other words, he can talk to dead people.

Ricci tries to contact Long, and enters many emotional pleas to Neeson that she is not dead but in fact trapped between the dead and the living. Neeson has his own demons, too (which are never fully explained), and although he gives a stoic, creepy performance, he is bogged down by a bad script, banal dialogue, and trite one-liners. Long struggles to emote throughout the film, as this is one of his weaker performances. Of course, there is the obligatory ""big twist"" at the film's end, and as there is in every other film like this, there is a mysterious young boy who can talk to the dead.

If you have low expectations, or are a fan of the ""Twilight Zone"" (minus the intelligent dialogue), you might find this rewarding. But if you are a fan of 1970's horror, or even J-horror films like ""The Ring,"" this is probably not intense or frightening enough for you to enjoy. A better film similar to this one is ""Nightwatch"" starring Josh Brolin and Ewan MacGregor. It has twice the scares, and is generally creepy. Perhaps the director should have borrowed from that film a bit as opposed to trying to make this film too ""noir.""

She spends 75% of the movie walking, sitting and laying around nude.
Since she is cute, you can't find any fault with that !

What struck me as the most eerie in this film was how Liam Neeson made this movie so near the time of his own wife's death.

It is the same strange feeling when you see Christopher Reeve's last movie where he played a paralyzed cop and weeks later was of course really paralyzed.

But for any of those that really missed the ending, he was a psychopath, and those pictures that he had on the wall, those that still had their eyes open were still alive when he killed them and those that didn't died a natural death.

I found it a boring and predictable movie. It did keep my attention because I kept waiting for it to get better but it didn't. I would not recommend this movie.",1284940800,,458,4.597560975609756
4128614,3,B003IY498Y,"Hello DVD buyers of Amazon,
you are probably looking for a review that is helpful yet to the point.

Here is my take on After Life.

Save the money if you are not a fan of Liam Neeson Justin Long or Christina Ricci.

However, if you are not a fan but are intrigued by a subtle turn for Justin Long Check it out.

If you think Christina Ricci is hot and are a die hard fan...get it.

If you enjoy a sympathetic individual that you don't know is a serial killer but could pass as one...check it out LIAM NEESON...is the next best behind of course Christoph Waltz's oscar winning Bastards...in terms of sympathetic killers you love and hate in todays film history.

Otherwise...save the money but enjoy a night of entertainment if you decide it buy it.",1284854400,,749,4.391304347826087

The plot was plodding and I found myself wanting to fast forward waiting for something, anything, to happen.

Justin Long was consistently overacting throughout the entire film - moving my feelings for his character from sympathy to mere annoyance. There was no explanation of Christina Ricci's walking, talking corpse or how exactly Liam neeson was helping her to make a transition. There were simply no apparent rules as to what was going on, and even at the end where you would expect an 'oh!' moment of clarification, you're left with a 'huh?' instead.",1284336000,2,606,4.836538461538462

Anna laments that she was ungrateful for her life, and for neglecting her boyfriend, played by Justin Long.  She's also angry over the fact that she died prematurely.

*spoiler* The movie plays with the idea that she isn't really dead after all, and that the funeral director is merely injecting her with medication to keep her alive and somewhat paralyzed for his own twisted schemes.

4128619,4,B003IY498Y,"This movie had a chilliness to its sensory feel. It was about a beautiful young girl who was trapped in a life without happiness. She self medicated and fought with her boyfriend in a world of listlessness and aimless lack of purpose. One encounter in her life up until death was touching, her connection with one of her pupils. The young boy reached out to her and she was able to resonant warmth to his questions and desire for nurture. This was the only time that we see her get in touch with love. When she goes to meet with her boyfriend things again get dark. In a stormy nite, in frustration and rage she ends up in an accident. Earlier in the day she had went to a funeral and met up with a creepy director who followed her with his eyes. She wakes up in the basement of his funeral parlor, where he seems to be working on her white deathly pale body. He talks with her and tells her she is dead and that he can communicate with those who are in the afterlife before the transition. He has such disregard for those who die without the love of life and reeks contempt toward her. It is uncertain if Ricci is really dead, she doesnt believe him and this could be denial or it could be the truth. She breathes onto mirrors and it shows her breath warm the glass. Is it true, could  her death have been faked. Her boyfriend and her student wrestle with this thought. Something inside of them urges both to try to see if she is really dead before her funeral. Was it her spirit calling out to them from the place of pre transition or was it their intution. The movie reflects her process with the ongoing struggle with life and death. She reflects back upon her life and trys to reconnect with the realness and playfulness she had once shared with her boyfriend before time marched on in her polished unhappy life. Everything was perfect but not inside. The undertaker is able to see her flacid attempt at escape and lack of motivation to gain back her unlived life. The ending is eerie and somewhat ghoulish, the undertaker takes the small student under his wing using his innocent need for attention to turn his imagination into twisted fixations of burying someone alive. Ricci doesn't seem to find closure nor does her boyfriend in this freaky film with darks and reds.",1283990400,3,2276,4.419047619047619
4128620,3,B003IY498Y,"Spoiler Alert-Anna was alive, - I watched the extras on the DVD. Most of the funeral directors ""clients"" were alive. This was a good movie, however this storyline is completely implausible. A mortician acquiring bodies that apparently never go any further than the scene of an accident to directly to his funeral home.  And apparently somehow acquiring a death certificate from a Doctor in the mean-time. This is the most confusing part of the movie which had me saying Anna has to be truly dead. But in the extra's the director makes it clear she's alive with most of the funeral directors previous unfortunate clients.  He apparently causes their deaths on the highway, running them off the road with his white van, never getting caught, no one ever seeing him involved in these accidents, and no damage to his van or himself. No police reports? All these bodies are just taken from the scene of an accident to a funeral home. No ambulances? Is it saying the mortician is there placing his death like inducing drug into all his new clients right before the ambulance arrives, with this the ambulance crew can now tell the Doctor at a hospital this persons dead. In America, you need an official death certificate; you only get this from a Doctor.  Would not the ambulances, the doctors, the police begin to suspect something after 5-6 people are involved in an accident and the mortician from down the road is always there on the scene first? Also, I was convinced she was dead because when Anna fist saw herself in a full length mirror, she was as she said ""a corpse"".  They never explained this, her grey skin, sullen eyes. Too many oddities-like was the little boy dead? His picture certainly seemed to be on the morticians wall-shown at least twice. Was he the one true ghost the mortician could speak with? I say he might have been dead by the way his mother never responded to him, appeared to never hear him or know he was around, in addition to just looking completely sad in her two appearances. There are about twenty odd little things that didn't  add up in the movie-I won't go into them all, but just to say one glaring oddity, one mortician runs this big funeral house by himself? No staff, no help. I've never been to a funeral home where only one person can run the funeral from beginning to end by themselves, but this one had several going at the same time.  I have to say however, I liked this movie. It was choopy, many absurd situations, but it was entertaining.",1283817600,2,2485,4.598194130925508

All the way through, you are guessing and are given clues to help you along.  However, the clues were confusing. The movie did hold my interest with good acting and an erie sort of weirdness.  Unfortunately, the ending was strange and unclear to me, and it wasn't until I watched the Director's comments, that I actually knew the answer. The Blu-Ray quality is good, but I found it difficult to understand the actors at times, as they spoke in muffled, low voices.  After.life is a very different kind of movie and certainly not for everyone.",1283644800,,656,4.629310344827586
4128622,4,B003IY498Y,"Liam Neeson does a wonderful job portraying a mysterious undertaker. He's a sort of Charon, the mythic ferryman who conveyed the dead to Hades along the River Styx.

But are the dead he's incising really dead? Or are his subjects merely dreaming him and their deaths? Or more disturbing still, is Neeson a serial killer who convinces his victims that they are dead while he starts the intimate process of stitching them, dressing them, applying make-up to them?

Neeson skillfully combines the oily sympathy of a funeral director with the soft, sinister, convincing quality of a killer. So which is he? This film keeps us guessing - and then some. It layers anomaly on anachronism. In that respect, it's a little like ""The Shining"" in which all sorts of supernatural elements, from telepathy to reincarnation, were mixed so thrillingly that the viewer didn't notice the overall incoherence of it all. Here we get a similar random potpourri of mystic, mystifying elements.

For example, there's the boy who's fascinated by the undertaker's art and who is becoming Neeson's sorcerer's apprentice. Having a youngster hovering wanly in the morgue is odd and unlikely enough by any interpretation of the movie's meaning. But then we see the boy at home. His mother appears too old and strangely desiccated to have borne him just ten or eleven years previous. But more puzzling still - while the movie as a whole is set in the present, with modern cars and all the modern conveniences - the boy's mother is seen staring at an episode of ""Beat the Clock"" on TV, a game show hosted by Bud Collyer and last aired in the mid 1950's. There's also a 1950's phone in the morgue. What are these brief time displacements supposed to mean? And what is that mysterious dot between ""After"" and ""Life"" doing in the movie title?

Director Wojtowicz-Vosloo does supply a pat interpretation of the film in a brief bonus commentary. She says, ""Of course, the explanation is..."" I don't think there could be any ""of course"" about it though. There's no single interpretation that could cover all the actions and oddities of the characters in this film. The Director's reductionism detracts from the spell cast by the film.

Despite there being a few too many conflicting spirits here, the film is haunting and poignant. Under its shroud of uncertainty, it left me with a greater appreciation for the preciousness of life, and that's a rare sentiment to carry away from a movie these days.",1283385600,9,2463,4.854761904761904
4128623,3,B003IY498Y,"For the first hour of the movie, it keeps you engaged and guessing. You are wondering what everyone wants to know: is Anna alive or dead?  Here is a brief summary of what transpires:

A dinner in which her boyfriend plans on proposing to her becomes yet another argument, and a huge misunderstanding.  Anna bolts from the restaurant, crying, and crashes her car while attempting to make a call on her cell phone.  When she wakes up, she is in a funeral parlor that is run by Eliot.  Eliot informs her that she had died in the car crash, and is presently in a stage between life and death called ""after life.""  But Anna doesn't believe she is dead, because she can breathe, she can think, and she can do other things that a dead person simply cannot do.

There are certain clues that makes you think she HAS to be alive, i,e, having the ability to break things when Anna (Christina Ricci) trashes Eliot's (Liam Neeson)funeral room, or when Eliot keeps injecting her with meds that causes her muscles to stop moving (temporary paralysis).  Or when the 11 year old boy sees her in the window.  The acting is great, and you are left wondering whether Eliot is what he appears to be: a sympathetic man who has a unique ""gift"" to be able to communicate with the dead; or whether he is a killer and is trying to take her life away.

But then the movie ceases to be interesting, and the viewer is left wondering what the true motive of the movie really is.  The last forty five minutes of the movie goes back and forth to persuade us that yes, she really is dead, or no, she really is still alive.  By the end, which has a weird twist to it, you realize what the truth really is, but by then you no longer really care.",1283385600,4,1710,4.309375
4128624,5,B003IY498Y,"About ""After. Life"": A perfect scary movie to watch at home with friends and popcorn. Some people say that the argument is difficult to get, I wouldn't say that. Mss Ricci does an amazing job once again.
About the dvd: Fine. There's a video where the director gives us some clues about the storyline.

You shouldn't miss it!",1282867200,2,324,4.586206896551724
4128625,4,B003IY498Y,"I've seen so many thrillers, suspense films and horror films that is the rare occasion when one can surprise me or better yet make my skin crawl. I know, perhaps that's not an experience one might wish for. But I'm not talking about a movie that will revolt you like HOSTEL (which I hated), I'm talking about a movie that you know will stick with you, that will make you think and in so doing just give you a case of the willies. With the release of AFTER LIFE, a new film can be added to that list.

The movie starts with a couple that seem to be having problems. Paul (Justin Long) is definitely in love with Anna (Christina Ricci) but her responses to him seem hesitant. The pair begin the film in bed with Anna seeming somewhat detached. It isn't until later that you know why.

The film moves to her day as an elementary teacher. At school she helps out a student named Jack (Chandler Canterbury) when picked on by older kids. Later when she goes to leave the school, an ominous set of lights shutting down as she walks leaves one with a sense that something is going to happen. When Jack suddenly shows, everything is back to normal. Or is it? After all, we've watched Anna taking meds along the way.

That night Anna and Paul are having dinner out, with Paul planning on making the big leap and proposing to her. But misunderstood cues lead to an argument and Anna leaving the restaurant. It is their last conversation as Anna ends up in an accident on the way home.

Now the scene shifts to the eerie. Anna wakes to find herself on the mortician's table at the local funeral home run by Eliot (Liam Neeson). When she asks what she's doing here, he calmly tells her that she is dead. But Anna refuses to believe this even though she can't move. Eliot explains to her that everyone seems to face their mortality the same way, with a great amount of denial at first.

The movie focuses mainly on the interplay between these two from here on out, with the occasional side trip to the world outside the funeral home doors. We see that Anna's mother, an overbearing invalid who wanted Anna there to take care of her forever, wasn't fond of Paul. We see Paul dealing with the death of a woman he truly loved. And we see Jack trying to figure out just what is going on in this odd world.

But Eliot and Anna are involved in a back and forth discussion of life and death. Eliot takes to making speeches about how the living take for granted everything that they have. He continues to attempt to comfort Anna and ease her into the world of the hereafter. But Anna fights it all the way, clinging to life, or what she assumes is life.

Scenes involving nightmares for both Anna and Paul leave you wondering where their heads are at the moment. And as the conversations between Eliot and Anna progress, as he injects her with a drug that is supposed to help ease her muscles now succumbing to rigor mortis, you start to wonder...is Anna really dead or not?

And that becomes the creepiest part of this film. You watch and try to decipher any clues you are offered as you attempt to determine if Anna is really dead or not. And if she's not dead, why is it that Eliot continues to tell her that she is? What reason could he have for lying to her?

I was afraid that this movie would have one of those trite endings where everything was hunky dory by the last reel. And then I was afraid that it would have one of those artsy endings where everyone dies. But, in fact, the end of this movie offers an ending that is acceptable, logical and terrifying all at the same time. More importantly, it's a satisfying ending.

The look of the film is fantastic. The funeral home has a stately mansion look to it while the morgue in the basement has an antiseptic feel to it. The photography is wonderful with clear images to muddle the mind as you try to figure out the dead or not dead story.

All of the actors do a great job here. Long seems truly despondent over the loss of his fianc. Ricci seems confused and yet forceful in her belief that she is not dead. And Neeson gives a stand out performance as the subdued mortician who feels he has been given a gift to talk to the dead.

I can see this film as one that will make viewers sit around and discuss it when it's over. It's one that will stick with you when the lights come on. And (unless you skip to the extras) you won't know the answer for sure even when the film finishes. And at times that can be a good thing. This movie might not be everyone's cup of tea, but I found it a movie that I didn't watch with my finger poised on the fast forward button. And for me, those films are truly rare these days.",1282780800,,4652,4.279863481228669
4128626,5,B003IY498Y,"Agnieszka Wojtowicz-Vosloo's ""Afterlife"" is a rare film that, while certainly not being the feel good movie of the week, is a serious meditation on life and death. Actor Liam Neeson has taken a decidedly different turn in his career (""Taken"", ""The A-Team"") and his change of cinematic scenery consummates itself in his role as Eliot Deacon, a funeral home director (the character's last name is most certainly no accident.)

The movie is not at all frolicsome: most of the crucial events happen predictably in Deacon's very own ""after.life"", the funeral home in which he imagines himself and unfortunately for all practical purposes is a God.  Christini Ricci (one of my favorite actresses who I was somehow not surprised to see here) is Anna Taylor, a young woman who crashes her car into a truck on a stormy night after an argument with her boyfriend Paul Coleman (Justin Long, an actor with the emotional reaction time of a brain damaged Keanu Reeves).  It is here that she departs from her death-in-life to a life-in-death, awakening in the somehow  hands of Deacon and being told that she is indeed dead, though she moves and breathes.

Deacon creates a sort of netherworld, an unholy monastery of the living but dead with his chosen ""profession"".  He administers all the drugs that would normally be reserved for a corpse to Anna, because in his personal opinion she is indeed dead as Jimmy Hoffa.  Protesting that she is alive, he exclaims: ""You people always say the same
things!""  Lording over her compromised psyche, one can tell if one watches closely that he is actually insane enough to let her try and escape. He considers himself a sort of father to these wounded people, and treats them like they are ""his children"".  He wants to see if these people who with unlived lives are finally ready to make some plunges once they face what they've always been avoiding: death.  And there is indeed a part in which Anna concedes to her fate: he opens the door and tells her to go, go see her boyfriend (who understands the reality of the situation intermittently but never gets the punch line till it's much too late) and Ricci's character states bluntly: ""I'm glad it's over.  I'm glad I'm dead.""

Embalming fluid drenches every frame of this movie like a waterfall and you can smell it.  It is not for everyone.  The bleak outlook on human nature even extends to the higher-ups: it's pretty obvious that somebody in the police department is working for Deacon, because the autopsy reports are never really legitimate and some ambulance, somewhere, must be delivering these people to him.  Deacon's character is so insane and yet so methodical that at times you wonder if he actually believes in what he's doing on a moral level.  Edgar Allan Poe would have been envious of what the director has accomplished here.  Though again not for everyone, fans of horror/psychological horror will have a good time with this film which one might even say is close to being a cult masterpiece.",1282176000,4,2990,4.797270955165692
4128627,2,B003IY498Y,I saw this on demand.  Great cast but it never comes together.  The thrill was missing in this thriller.  The plot was plodding and predictable.  The movie felt very derivative of others that came before it and there was something lacking.  It is basically a movie about a dead girl who says she is not dead.  You have to wait 1 and 1/2 hours to find out if she is or not.  It's a long wait.,1281744000,22,391,4.065789473684211
4128628,3,B003IY498Y,"I have to say I liked this film.  I agree it was slow moving but thought provoking.  Some of the scenes were a bit contrived like the argument and accident scene, but still it kept me interested.  It reminded me of a little horror movie called ""Kissed"" where the heroine could not connect with living people and could only love the dead.

Ricci's character walks through life and misses out much like she is dead and when she really is ""dead"" she finds out what living is all about.  Neeson's character may be the stand in for the grim reaper himself taking people who have lost their lust for life.  In
any case he is the only one who can communicate with the recently dead.

I too was puzzled that Liam Neeson would chose this film, but perhaps it helped him work through his own grief.",1281571200,2,788,4.3561643835616435
4128629,2,B003IY498Y,"Warning:  this review contains ""spoiler"" information.

I decided this film deserved 2 stars instead of 3 stars because the good points -- top-notch acting, good score, nice scenes/setting, and beautiful cinematography -- could not outweigh the huge disadvantage of fragmented, imperfect storytelling littered with too many plotholes, red herrings, and loose ends as a substitute for ambiguity.

I ordered this film because of the cast and the impressive trailer. The trailer left me with the incorrect impression the film was a supernatural thriller.

In an effort to legimitimize itself as an ""artistic"" work, the film includes much skin-baring of Christina Ricci.  She spends most of the film in a clingy red slip.  A few gratuitous nude scenes are included, but they aren't sexy or titillating, some are quite gory.

The film is rife with cliche -- the child sociopath eager to graduate from torturing/killing animals to torturing/killing people.  The ingenue lost in a maelstrom of confusion and lacking the courage to save her own life.  The hateful, selfish, abusive mother.  The love interest, an attorney best friends with a cop, is convinced his girlfriend is still alive and promptly drinks himself under the table instead of doing something about it.

The biggest letdown is Deacon (Liam Neeson's character) and his motives.  I mean, come on! This guy justifies his compulsion as purging the world/society of ""lifeless"" people.  I saw nothing in the film depicting Deacon as somehow more interesting, productive, or worthy of life/living than his victims.

There's plot twisting and then there's self-indulgent, unreliable storytelling.  ""After. Life"" represents the second example.  If you enjoy stories of bland, generally unlikeable morticians who kidnap accident victims, employ psychological manipulation and ply the victim with drugs to convince them they're deceased, administer paralytic drugs to give them the appearance of death, and chat nonsensically with souvenir photographs of the victims after funerals and premature burials, this movie might work for you.",1281398400,7,2083,5.482758620689655
4128630,4,B003IY498Y,"I must admit that I was a bit confused after having watched this film. However, I felt compelled to go to the ""Extra Features"" after the movie was over. I normally do not do this. After having done so I saw a quick interview with the director. She described some information about the movie which makes a LOT more sense. I was rather ""riveted"" by what the director was saying while there were flashbacks from the movie to show what she was talking about and to fill in the blanks.

I would love to go into detail about all of it here but I think it would give too much away. I would recommend watching the movie and then watch the extra feature ""Delving Into the Afterlife."" I found the director to be rather clever in executing the entire storyline. But I will admit that it was a long movie and I was a tad confused. But after having heard the director comment I am now recollecting the entire movie in my mind and am able to put the pieces together. I am so tempted to go into detail and I just realized that some reviewers gave too much away already. ROTTEN SPOILERS YOU! I am glad I saw the movie first along with the director's comments before having seen the reviews here.

I did not know what to expect since I rented this movie from a machine (outside a grocery store) without knowing what to expect. I thought it was going to be a supernatural thriller. It was, indeed, thought provoking regarding the fact that we will all eventually die. If a few details could have been more polished I would give this movie five stars but I am giving it four. It is definitely an above average film. And I love the cast, by the way.",1281398400,2,1629,4.285714285714286
4128631,2,B003IY498Y,"After. Life has such a great cast but great cast doesn't always = great movie. I have nothing negative to say about the actors they all did their part. However, what can you say about a movie that honestly just isn't good. This is a psychological thriller that does little to make you think or play on the mind. You can honestly predict what is going to happen and that's never a good thing in psychological thriller. Your supposed to throw curves and keep the audience guessing and them blow them away with the conclusion. Nothing of the sort is to be seen here. The worse part of this mix in are awkward cheap spook you scenes. They don't fit in with the story and don't at all add in any relevant sense to the movie. With such a great cast I think the story should have been better. These actors were too good for this film. Without saying so much about the film (because there isn't much to say without spoiling the shallow plot) the best thing to do is skip it or watch it when it comes on cable. There's nothing note worthy about it and I honestly wish I spent my time watching something else. Bottom line great cast but horrible movie. The concept was good but could have and should have been written much much better. I'm actually very disappointed in this film I really wanted to enjoy this film but there wasn't anything about it worth commenting on.

4128635,1,B003IY498Y,"Liam Neeson continues his brief run of morally bankrupt thrillers (""Taken"") with this dreadful offering. The movie may appeal to viewers for whom plot plausibility does not matter; for whom continuity errors are negligible problems (note Ms. Ricci's hair color, which stays persistently red even after the undertaker has rinsed the dye from it); and for whom the sight of the frequently naked Ms. Ricci compensates for this dismal experience. And it will also appeal to, or not adversely affect, aficionados of torture porn, which  this repulsive piece of junk queasily resembles. Although it is hard to describe without giving away the fairly obvious ""twist,"" ""After.life"" tells the story of a deranged mortuary director (Neeson) who speaks to the not-yet-dead as they are about to take that great leap into the beyond. The film's director attempts to cover the grisly tale with a thin patina of cinematic or metaphysical ambiguity, but a moment's thought reveals that these efforts are merely incoherent, not complicating. Some examples of the film's slovenly failings: the movie forgets about Ricci's character's medical condition; the creepy kid who shadows Neeson and becomes his acolyte seems to have a dead mother who watches t.v. from the 1950s, but who quickly drops out of the movie; the cops somehow have no idea that there's anything shady about this undertaker; and, best of all, accident victims apparently go straight to the mortuary, still bloodied, bypassing hospitals and doctors, or are hastily pronounced dead so that they can suffer at the weirdo's hands (a procedural implausibility that could only be explained if the cops were somehow complicit in Neeson's character's perversions). The excellent Josh Charles (not to mention Ricci) is wasted in a throwaway role, and Justin Long looks lost, as usual. A really terrible movie.",1281225600,14,1850,5.25
4128636,5,B003IY498Y,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this film.  I like all the actors and thought the story sounded very intruiging but today so many films released in no way match their potential.  The film stars Christina Ricci as Anna, a school teacher who is involved with lawyer Paul Coleman who is played by Justin Long.  The movie is filmed with a mysteriousness to it from the very beginning.  These two are a couple yet they are fighting from the very beginning.  It is hard to get a grasp at first on how we are to connect to them.  But if you have read anything about this film you know that Anna gets in an accident and dies.  Yet the question becomes is she really dead or not?  Saying this much is giving away none of the plot.  Most of the movie takes place with Anna's body in the funeral home where she is being prepared for her funeral and burial by the funeral director Deacon played by Liam Neeson.  But Christina Ricci is not lying still as the dead do.  She is awake, alert and very confused by her surroundings and predicament.  Liam Neeson supposedly has a special sense where he can communicate with the dead and he explains all to her as he tries to get her prepared for her next step in death.  Many people view Anna's body and all they see is a dead corpse.  It is only Deacon who can interact with the woman.

But the movie is in no way this simple.  We have a young boy, one of Anna's students, who can also see her and Paul never believes that she is indeed dead.  I was caught up in the film from the beginning but was delighted when the script introduced many twists and turns that answered all and any questions and also brought up many issues all people have about living life, experiencing love and accepting fate.  Christina Ricci is superb as Anna.  Yes, she is naked throughout a great deal of the film but her skills are so extreme that it is in no way gratuitous.  It is necessary for the plot and though she is a very beautiful woman you will find yourself following her superb acting more than dwelling on the lack of clothing.  Liam Neeson is also excellent and Justin Long was an excellent choice as the solid everyman type boyfriend.  He is a good person with no motives.  He merely loves Anna deeply.

The twists and turns make sense here and the director weaves it all together with skill and great intelligence.  This film is a psychological drama but also a very high suspense film.  It pulls you in, gets you to care for these characters be they good or bad and then the twists get tossed in.  Like I said, they all work and they will send you on a headspin which is what a good suspense film does.  I was so enthralled in the last half I did not want it to end.  Is Anna dead or alive?  This question is the basis for what is an excellent strong drama with heaps of believable suspense.  And the film also stayed with me long after with many thoughts runing through my head.  Another sign of a great film.  I highly recommend this film but just remember it is not your regular nonsensical thriller.  You must pay attention with this one and never let your guard down.  And then it will be a great experience.",1281225600,4,3142,4.285714285714286

8397753,3,B003IY498Y,"I just don't know how to feel about this movie.

Liam Neeson is great as always, Christina Ricci is terrible, the plot is interesting and unique. The boyfriend's scenes just wasted time where a psychological thriller could have been expanded on.

The story was good but my biggest regret is watching the end. The fact that they give you a definitive answer at the end of the movie absolutely ruins it. It bothers me so much and I can't quite figure out why.

This movie has stuck with me and I've even had nightmares regarding it. It wasn't even that good. It's just pissing me off at this point.",1527638400,,596,4.4495412844036695

8397758,2,B003IY498Y,Liam Neeson and Christina Ricci get my 2 stars because I just love them and their acting abilities. But this was a very badly written script and a boring movie from start to finish . I waited and there is nothing worse then waiting for something to happen that never does . This is just a disappointment and a low budget film horrid script that 2 great actors stared in and I don't know why .,1522800000,,392,4.171052631578948

8397760,5,B003IY498Y,"The movie is very dark and disturbing. Pretty good though. It let me know exactly what goes on at a funeral home. I had no idea that morticians/funeral home directors could talk with the dead. Who knew! I called a friend that does this and he said it was not true. What a liar! Oh, almost forgot the most important part.....Christina Ricci is naked almost the whole time. Man she's hot. Also, I think the movie had a little kid and some guy that cried alot.",1521763200,,457,4.325581395348837
