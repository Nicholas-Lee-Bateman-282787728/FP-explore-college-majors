8254043,3,B00141VKC6,"Mortuary is a direct to video and Sci-fi channel rumpus that deals with a family moving into a small town funeral home to revive business so to speak.  It's only marginally scary or gory as it seems to be aimed at the 16 year old crowd but some of the humor is dead on and it moves very quickly.  Prom night did tons of biz in the early eighties and some consider it a minor classic(I don't)but I've seen far worse. It's your standard story of teens getting their come- uppance for something they did last summer (sound familiar? started here). It's not a bad movie just too predictable and rather light on the blood for my tastes. For the price, lovers of the genre should have a good time and buy with confidence. The company shipped it fast and both movies look great. Haven't check out special features yet but both disccs have them I believe.

8254044,4,B00141VKC6,"Prom Night with Jamie Lee Curtis is a classic, and the reason I bought this DVD, but I was pleasantly surprised with the bonus feature here Mortuary, it starts Denise Crosby who played Tasha Yar on Star Trek TNG it was fun seeing her again, and I thought the movie was done really well, and I'm happy to have it in my collection, so if your shopping for Prom Night on DVD I recommend this one with the added bonus of Mortuary.",1257379200,2,426,4.2073170731707314
