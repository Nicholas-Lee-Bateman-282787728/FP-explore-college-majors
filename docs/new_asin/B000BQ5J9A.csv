8208611,4,B000BQ5J9A,"Well-done, High energy show at Hmmrsmth Odn '85. Lineup: Lemmy,  Mike ""Wurzel"" Burston (sp?)Phil Cambell, Pete Gill. Very good sound quality. Not the best in terms of visuals, shots of Lem during the guitar solos, bad lighting, etc. Actually 'live', as opposed to ""Best of MH"", which is a collection of videos and not a concert.  Special guest appearance by Wendy O. Williams on ""No Class"", but she is too low in the mix. For the final rendition of 'Motorhead' (the song), every member of MH, past or present (up till '85) is on stage, plus Phil Lynott of Thin Lizzy. This isn't so great, as we see each of them for 0.23 seconds

the best MH concert vid is of the '82 show in Toronto, because it has the ""Fast and Philthy"" lineup and the sound is incredibly good. unfortuneately, that one is only available as a bootleg.",1156723200,3,820,4.489932885906041
