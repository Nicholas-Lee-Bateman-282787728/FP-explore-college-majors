3611835,5,B001GJOL4K,"My favorite extension of Dancing with the Stars! Lisa Rinna is just as great as she was on the show- she really pushed me to get my cardio up and her cute outfits only made me want to work it harder! Not much of a fitness fiend, but learning key steps from my favorite dances is enough motivation. For anyone that loves dancing- this video is an A plus!",1231113600,6,353,4.130434782608695
3611836,5,B001GJOL4K,I lost more than 5 pounds with this workout video. Lisa Rinnas DVD: Jive Jump Ballroom Bump really worked for me. I haven't found a workout this simple and entertaining EVER. I highly recommend it to anyone that doesn't have time to leave the house. I just popped it in the DVD player and danced off all my extra calories.,1231113600,3,322,4.383333333333334
3611837,2,B001GJOL4K,"The other reviews convinced me to give this a try. Although I really enjoy Lisa's attitude and confidence, there are several drawbacks to the workout.

1) The cueing is spotty.  Because the routines are complex and fast, this is an important omission.

2) When she says ""turn left"" - to the audience, she actually means, "" turn right.""  I was always in the reverse image. EVERY other exercise video I've tried accounts for this.

3) There isn't enough awareness about safety when stretching or moving fast.

With some coaching Lisa could be a terrific instructor. She has the body, motivation, and good energy to inspire.  The routines were close, too, and fun, but I couldn't overcome the drawbacks.  The ability to move well and have great rhythm is a huge plus, but she needs to study with instructors who've made successful videos. Till then, I humbly suggest that she not quit her day job;)",1307577600,2,895,4.766233766233766
3611838,4,B001GJOL4K,"This is a really fun dance video! Moves are easy and instruction segment is pretty straight forward. The only complaint I would have is that Lisa is a little ""lazy"" about keeping you on count and preparing you for the next move. It is alot of fun though and she is motivating and I have always loved her! You will sweat with this one, too!! Have fun w/ it!!",1252368000,,357,4.188405797101449
3611839,5,B001GJOL4K,"After a rocky start this is now my favorite cardio video and I have tried too many to count.  Please don't feel discouraged by the jive in the first segment.  That is by far the trickiest to get down but not impossible.  The choreography is AMAZING.  The steps SEEM simple but they make you feel like a professional dancer. I love that they are challenging but that the steps repeat in a pattern so a regular person can follow along.  I did the video twice before adding my own music with the video on mute.  This makes the video SO great and different than others - the steps stay the same but the music can change as often as you like. This difference is key.  I can't dance to music that is boring so being able to have simple steps that repeat is really a revelation to me.  I also appreciate that there are not too many traveling steps...for those of us that live in small apartments.  Lisa won me over with her personality that is so warm and friendly. There is a great group of pro dancers who put there own spin on the steps.  I did this video with my teenage niece and she loved it too (we both were chanting ""single, single, double on the same side""  Thanks for making these great workouts.  I am a convert and can't wait until more come out!!!",1236556800,13,1254,4.244725738396625
3611840,5,B001GJOL4K,"Since I am both a fitness instructor for the YWCA and a Ballroom Dancer I was naturally curious to see what this video contained.  I love it!!  My husband & I have watched Dancing with the Stars since it started and think Louie VanAmstel a very sharp dancer, teacher & choreographer.  Lisa is cute and a button and does a great job of explaining and demonstrating the dance steps.  It is already beginning to pay off for me.  I would highly recommend the video to anyone wanting to improve their physical fitness and have fun doing it.",1236211200,2,535,4.474226804123711
3611841,4,B001GJOL4K,"I really enjoy doing this workout, it feels good and it is somewhat of a challenge as I seem to have two left feet now that I am almost 40! This is a great alternative to aerobics - which I have never liked.",1235779200,2,207,3.8372093023255816
3611842,4,B001GJOL4K,I don't understand what people are talking about. Lisa Rinna's Dance Body Beautiful DVD's are some of my favorite. She is adorable in teaching it and the moves and dances are great. Really gets you moving and working up a sweat. Cant wait for more of her Dvd'S to come out!!!!!!! I will buy them all. IT's A GREAT WORKOUT!,1234742400,,322,4.383333333333334
3611843,3,B001GJOL4K,"I found this dance/exercise video difficult to follow.  Although the back ground participants were able to be in step with Lisa, I was often seeking her beat..... I had my own which is steady.",1234137600,,192,4.647058823529412
3611844,1,B001GJOL4K,"I loved Lisa on ""Dancing with the Stars"" and really thought this would be a great DVD. I was wrong. It is very hard to follow. Her cues were off and too often the camera is focused on her face instead of on her feet or full body. I'm not trying to learn how to smile. I'm trying to learn the workout. Great idea, bad video. I would love for you to try it again and focus on the student not the star.",1233360000,8,399,3.819277108433735
3611845,3,B001GJOL4K,"I just tried this video, & as a beginner I found it very hard to follow. The only workout that I could attempt with any confidence was the first one (the Super Rumba). The remaining 3 dance steps were broke down very poorly (she shows you the steps way too quickly & with unhelpful screen shots -- if you're going to show us dance steps, show us your feet the whole time, & from angles that actually show us how to do the steps!). And then the ""slow"" versions of last 3 dance steps are way too fast for someone who is just starting out. The bonus abs workout was ok & I'll probably start doing that more often.

I'll keep trying it, but I wish the creators of this workout would have chosen less complicated steps, or at least broke down these steps in a more user-friendly way.",1231891200,2,778,4.221476510067114
3611846,5,B001GJOL4K,"I know why Lisa has that rock hard body now - it's not as easy as it looks! At first I struggled to keep up, but because its building on basic dance moves, I caught on very quickly. Good warm ups too- nice and slow.",1231286400,5,215,3.8
8305674,1,B001GJOL4K,"The dance routines on this video are fun and energetic, and I particularly like the way the movements work my calves. But either Lisa Rinna has no sense of rhythm, or the sound editors don't know how to sync her steps with the music. I suspect the problem lies with Rinna, because I have noticed the same issue with all of her other dance videos. As a musician it drives me nuts that she is way off the beat throughout. Once I learn the steps, I have to keep my eyes closed so I can just follow the music. It throws me off to watch her doing the dances hopelessly out of sync. Why in the world would her handlers allow her to embarrass herself like this?",1498435200,,654,4.15748031496063

8305680,3,B001GJOL4K,"Lisa Rinna: Dance Body Beautiful: Jive, Jump, Ballroom Bump

Bought MANY of these types of music trying to figure out how I come to have Diabetes. Didn't work....",1400112000,,162,4.785714285714286
8305681,3,B001GJOL4K,Not much to say about this product but that its okay nothing amazing but not horrible. Didnt really feel motivated by the dvd,1354233600,,125,4.478260869565218
8305682,4,B001GJOL4K,"After reading several reviews about Lisa Rinna's ""Dance Body Beautiful"" series being poorly produced, I was a bit apprehensive about this DVD.  It seemed many people said she danced off beat, didn't cue well, and was altogether a horrible instructor.  I'm not necessarily going to say that the people who said that were wrong, but I will say that all of those comments are a bit exaggerated.  While this series isn't perhaps the most professionally produced and Lisa isn't the most graceful hostess, I still really enjoyed the routines in this workout and felt like they were pretty effective!

With the exception of the warm up and cool down, all of the routines consisted of four sections: breakdown, slow, medium, and fast.  Breakdown was Lisa alone showing you how to do the moves in the routine.  It only lasts a few minutes, but it's very helpful for the choreography.  The screen will be split, showing a full body shot of Lisa on one side, with the other side being a zoomed in picture of her feet.  I thought this was great for someone who has never danced before; you really can get the routine down before moving on.  Slow, medium, and fast were exactly what they sounded like; you would do the routine that you've just learned to 3 different songs which are at 3 different speeds.

WARM UP - You start off the DVD with very simple steps to get the body moving.  All that Lisa does is lead the viewer through some marching and step touching.  After doing that for 2-3 minutes, she'll do some basic stretches and then hold a squat for a long time.  Your legs will probably be burning by the end of the warm-up, and you will most definitely be warm.

JIVE - I really liked the Jive routine.  It only had about four different steps, but they were all high energy and fun to do.  This section worked my calves while still giving me a great cardio workout.  Moves included triple steps and rock steps, if you are familiar with either of those.

CHA CHA - While this routine was good, I wish I had done it before Jive.  I felt like it wasn't as intense or intricate, but it was still fun.  The cha-cha beat is really emphasized by Lisa, which is great for people who have never done this dance before.  If you have danced cha-cha before, you will recognize some moving cha-cha steps such as new yorkers.

SALSA - This routine is the main reason the DVD got 4 stars instead of 5; it's composed of baby moves, and I hated it.  The choreography is basically the same step over and over again, only in different directions.  It wasn't cardio for me at all, and I feel like even extreme beginners will get bored easily doing this Salsa.  In case you have danced Salsa before, the salsa basic is the move repeated the entire time (forward/back, to the side, diagonal).

DISCO - Technically Disco isn't a ballroom dance, but I'm so glad Lisa included this style on the DVD!  This routine is my favorite; I had a blast while still getting a great cardio workout.  You'll recognize some triple steps that you did in Jive; you'll also being doing some hip shaking and rolling arms.  Every step is really energetic and fun!

COOL DOWN - There really isn't much to say about the cool down.  Lisa leads you through a few stretches, then congratulates you on completing the workout.  I wish that a few more stretches had been included, but I feel that this cool down is sufficient for the workout that I did.

BONUS - There's a bonus on every DVD in the series.  On ""Jive, Jump, Ballroom Bump"" the bonus is a three-minute interview with Lisa.  She discusses the series as a whole and how being on Dancing with the Start inspired her.

Now that I've broken down the workout for you, let me break down the instructor.  Lisa has many flaws; however, that makes her extremely easy to relate with.  You'll almost feel like you're just dancing with a friend instead of working out.  She is constantly pushing that she's not a professional, and if she can do it, you can do it, too.  It may seem cheesy at first, but it's surprisingly motivational at the same time.  Her cuing is definitely funky, especially since she will call out the moves from her perspective (her right and left instead of yours).  She's also off beat a few times during the DVD, but I didn't find it incredibly distracting; I just stayed on beat, and she caught up.  She also messed up a few moves, but it wasn't particularly frustrating.  I was expecting a lot worse.  If you go into this workout knowing that it's not perfect and Lisa makes a few mistakes, you shouldn't have too much trouble keeping up.

Overall, I'm really impressed with Lisa's first workout DVD.  I'm excited to try the others!  I recommend this video to people who enjoy ballroom dance or want to try it out.  I think it's mostly beginner-friendly because of the breakdown, but intermediates will still get a good workout, and advanced exercisers can use it as an effective off-day workout, too.

8305683,1,B001GJOL4K,"I am SHOCKED that anybody enjoys or uses this video. It's insanely boring, Lisa is lost half of the time, and you can barely hear the music. Perhaps it serves a purpose of teaching very basic dance steps, but it's laughable as a workout video. The fast version of each dance lasts 90 seconds. That's a whopping six minutes of cardio. And if you want to skip the tutorials and just get to work, you'll have to use the menu again and again. Horrible. Really, I can't believe how bad it is.  Do not waste your money!",1308960000,,513,4.288659793814433
