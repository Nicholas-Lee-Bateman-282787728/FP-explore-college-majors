7125670,4,B00W7AHDIS,"Yes! It has come to this:
A [seperate] BONUS FEATURES release.

The Assylum has sucked ME into their franchise, er, uh...
hook; line; and sinker!

At 77-minutes---with a Diet Coke---I can, now, hear about
inappropriate humour involving shark attacks... something
that, normally, wouldn't raise a grin, but would, a grimace.

Starts out with NINE up-front preview-trailers; ends with a sneak-peek of Sharknado 3: Oh hell no!

Not Academy/Emmy Award winning stuff, but like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Supernatural/dp/B00T5D4QIA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Supernatural</a>;

subject that's more popular than important matters such as VOTING.

I may not believe in The President... or a-c-t-u-a-l ancient aliens,
but, I believe in rubber sharks that KILL! Put ME in ""The Assylum""!",1438646400,5,1281,8.9765625
