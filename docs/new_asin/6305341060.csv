1022658,3,6305341060,"A tyrannesaurus with a spike on its nose?  Well, I guess all the old movies got it wrong.  We now know that if these meat eating dinosaurs walked upright they would break their backs.  Here they do so with no trouble, in a lumbering walk fashion, and make nasty faces at visitors to the island.  Would there be enough food for these monsters on an island ten miles square?  Ah, real science is ruining these movies for me.
Unlike most films of this genre from the 40's and 50's, it is filmed in expensive CINECOLOR.  Not rated, it was released in 1948 by Albert Jay Cohen Productions Inc.  The DVD is released through Image Entertainment and runs 72 minutes with no extras.
It is a picture reminescent of King Kong with the sea journey and an island of jungle and prehistoric beasts.
Stereotypes abound in the characters and the plot is totally predictable.  Viewers may recognize scenes that were salvaged for the film, HORROR OF THE BLOOD MONSTERS (1970) with John Carradine.
The plot is simple.  Philip Reed, played by Ted Osborne and Virginia Grey, played by Carole Lane hire Captain Tarnowski, played by Barton MacLane, to take them by steamer to an uncharted island.  During the war, Reed flew over the island and caught sight of prehistoric creatures.  He wants to return and take photographs to prove his discovery.  They are introduced to John Fairbanks, played by Richard Denning, the lone survivor from a shipwreck upon its shores.  Surviving mutiny at sea, they reach their objective and the native crew become fodder for the beasts and the sea.  The captain suffers from malaria, is a drunkard, wants a specimen for the return journey, and also wants the girl.  Here is where the real plot tension emerges.  Reed shows himself more interested in his photos than in Grey who sponsored the expedition.  A romance buds between Fairbanks and Grey.  Not giving any more away, that is about it.
Richard Denning has done several films in science fiction/horror, including CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON and THE DAY THE WORLD ENDED.  He gives a good performance although his sailor suit is rather silly.
There is a giant sloth on the island that has taken to killing people, looks rather ape-like.  The man in the suit was Ray Corrigan, who often dressed up for the movies, i.e. DR. RENAULT'S SECRET, THE WHITE GORILLA, NABONGA, and ""It"" in IT! THE TERROR FROM BEYOND SPACE.  Like the dinosaurs, the costumes look silly, but hey, even Godzilla is a man in a rubber suit.
The script could have used more work.  Note these lines from Fairbanks:  ""It's quicker having your throat cut by a lascar's knife than to be crushed by a monster you don't even see or hear until a shadow as big as a mountain falls on you."" Huh?  Where's the logic in that?  Despite the danger, Fairbanks permits Grey to go off into the jungle by herself (unarmed) saying simply, ""Stay on the path.""  Pleeeeease!  Do the dinosaurs avoid the path?
As for the dinosaurs, I liked them, not because they were good, but because they were funny looking.  Hey, at least they did not strap ridges and hornes to lizards and pretend they were giants!  The dinosaurs get a kill but you would have to be a one-legged stroke victim to really be caught by these guys, they are so slow.  The alignment in the mouthes of the creatures is a bit off and they remind me of Henson's early sock puppets.
The full-screen DVD is not too bad and even younger kids can probably watch it in ease.
>No nudity.
>The Captain makes unwanted advances upon Grey.
>Fight scenes and murder (hey even pirate and cowboy movies have these).

1022659,3,6305341060,"Call me crazy, but I actually like this movie.  It's a reminder of a time when a good adventure story was all it took to keep a kids attention glued to the screen.  The special effects are far from special, but that's part of the charm of this rather obscure man vs. dinosaur film.
I've been an enthusiast of b-movies for years, but wasn't familiar with this one until I caught it on AMC recently.  I was intrigued by the well-worn story, the wretched dino costumes, and the truly horrible acting. (just watch the ship captain!)  All this and color, too.  That must be the cause of the total lack of budget for the remainder of the production, as color was something special in the '40s, and usually reserved for only the high-end films.  This isn't art, but if you're in the mood for a bit of mindless retro-adventure, this may be the ticket.",1002067200,12,843,4.441558441558442
1022660,2,6305341060,"I'm usually a sucker for this genre but I found myself agreeing with Maltin for once.  The acting and dinosaur effects were good enough for this type of movie.  It was the storyline and lack of creativity with the effects that killed it for me.  I also feel that this being filmed in color all but destroyed the b/w Saturday matinee atmosphere that makes these movies so fun to watch.  Overall, worth a watch, but I'd recommend investing in 1957's 'The Land Unknown' with Jock Mahoney before you spent a dollar on this one.

One of the few sci-fi films from its time to be filmed in color, the character development is not only excellently done, particularly the ship's captain, but surprisingly frank for a film of its era.

Poor Richard Denning is shanghaied into being their tour guide once they get to the Unknown Island.  Id blow my brains out first before Id go back to that island!  Easier said than done.
The unfortunate cover art aside, this movie is obviously low low how low can you go low budget, as can be appreciated with the rubberized monsters.  Surprisingly, the actors manage to ignore their sad surroundings and deliver some believable performances.  The plot though, is pretty standard for this type of movie.  There are no surprises but for the truly abysmal creatures that waddle and roam the island like misshapen pull toys.  If you can get past the lack of originality and just think of it as another crazy adventure, you might like it.  I think its a hoot.

1023721,4,6305341060,"Image Entertainment has released a staple of sixties television, Director Jack Bernhard's 'UNKNOWN ISLAND', a pulpy cross between thrills reminiscent of Ernest B.Schoedsack's 'KING KONG' (but without the quality) and 'BOY'S LIFE' magazine hi-jinks rounding out a 75 minute guilty pleasure.  The film is peppered with Warner Brothers wiseguy attitudes but has a charming poverty row feel.  Actor Barton MacLane and Richard Denning provide the male testosterone and Virginia Grey the cigarette smoking tough gal with the heart of gold and greedy, namby-pamby Philip Reed as Grey's beau who gets everyone to go on the wild expedition balances the rest.  The film has the legend of having the worst man-in-a-suit dinosaurs but at least it doesn't steal footage from Director Hal Roach Jr.'s 'ONE MILLION B.C.'-1940 and yet , some Sci-Fi titles of the fifties borrowed footage from 'UNKNOWN ISLAND'.  The highlight is the gorilla passing as a prehistoric sloth played by Ray Crash Corrigan in his suit used in Director Edward Dymytrik's 'CAPTIVE WILD WOMEN'- 1943.  If anyone is curious about the Cinecolor process, this negative is the one to view because the transfer is beautiful considering its age.  Director Bernhard who also helmed Lon Chaney Jr.s first Horror exercise 'MAN MADE MONSTER'-1941 and did some early television directs with workman like precision and the sauntering, nostalgic music score by Rauol Kraushaar enhances the mayhem. The film came along right before Ernest B. Schoedsack's 'KONG' hommage 'MIGHTY JOE YOUNG'-1948 which contained better effects and has a better reputation but 'ISLAND' is always remembered by baby boomers who viewed it on their primitive black and white TV sets in the late fifties and sixties. It's great to see Richard Denning cutting his teeth on this type of role which he would own in fifties Sci-Fi classics and Virginia Grey never looked more beautiful.  As a boy, I never saw this film in color, and this release was a revelation and still holds up well in this age of CGI eye candy.",1311120000,4,2034,5.126888217522659

Once I discovered this movie was dated 1948, it all fell into place. Although the film is watchable... the negative has definitely seen some wear... as had some of the actors.

This is definitely a throwback to the B movies of the 50s and early 60s. That said, I enjoyed it. Take it for what it is, and you may enjoy it, too.

Most of the characters are unlikeable, including the female lead.  Fairbanks is the only character you care about.  In any case, it is a fun ride and if you aren't the type who will spend the entire time nit-picking, you'll enjoy it.

1023857,2,6305341060,"This movie is forgettable and laughable. I purchased it on the strength of a previous review, which was sadly inaccurate.

The movie's stars are well-known for the many films they did. The acting in this one is better than expected. The plot is predictable, but could have worked if the special effects had been better than cheap, childish Halloween costumes. I have never been a fan of the Godilla movies because I found the man in the rubber suit more distracting and laughable than scary. The producers of this film used men in rubber suits to portray tyrannasaurs. Can you imagine a pack of such monsters attacking? The final battle between a sloth monster and a tyrannasaur is so fake even small children wouldn't be either intrigued or scared.

This film was made in 1948 and used actors of ability and talent in a poorly written, badly presented product. Even the editing was amaturish. I was embarrassed for the actors when I watched it. I'm sure the stars don't list this film in their credits without blushing. The only thing that could be called a plus for this movie is the talents of the stars. They alone put this film in the B catagory. Without them, this film would be deservedly lying on the cutting room floor in its entirety.

This film is a fine example of how NOT to make a film. This could have been a memorable, but mediocre film, if the producers had bothered to take advantage of available special effects.

1023858,3,6305341060,"My brother and I saw this film on TV (in B/W) on a Sunday afternoon in the late 1950s. We missed the opening and tuned in when the crew was already on the island. Our attention was caught by roaring sounds off-screen.  We yelled to our Mom, who was in the kitchen, saying that the roars might be from dinosaurs (which the two of us were nuts about back then).  She disagreed, saying that it was probably lions.  A few moments later we two kids were vindicated when the Ceratosauri appeared.  What a thrill!  However, by the time the film had finished I was anything but thrilled.  I was very disturbed and frightened.  Not because of the monsters themselves, but because of the film's eerie, unpleasant atmosphere.  The most upsetting thing was the final fight between the ape/sloth and the dinosaur. During one quick closeup it appeared that the ape had had one of its eyes gouged out.  Whether it actually had or was just an effect of the lighting I can't say, but it looked like it to me.  I'm not sure why, but for some reason this detail, combined with the film's hostile and in ways almost surrealistic feel, mildly traumatized me. The effect lasted for the rest of the day and into the night. I recall being badly spooked that night and having a hard time getting to sleep.

An odd detail was that when my brother and I looked in the TV Guide to find out the name of the film, it showed the title ""Rocky"".  This was obviously a mistake, yet for years we both thought that this was the film's name.

I know that this low-budget production seems crude and even laughable nowadays, but to me it has always held a special place in my mind, a one-of-a-kind film experience.  Nothing extreme, just unique.  And weird.",1258243200,,1718,4.461538461538462

1023860,3,6305341060,"UNKNOWN ISLAND is the kind of dinosaur movie that you take seriously, even with some pretty cut rate special effects.  What elevates this movie above its bottom feeder competitors is the surprisingly strong acting.  Virginia Grey and Phillip Reed are a couple who hire a barge captained by Barton MacLane to sail to the ""unknown"" island of the title because Reed knows that it is full of dinosaurs that have somehow survived from the Cretaceous to the present.  They hire Richard Denning, who had actually been on the island before barely escaping with his life, to accompany them as a guide.  The idea is for Reed to take pictures which they can sell for a fortune.  Up to the point where they actually land on the island, director Jack Bernhard shows considerable respect for the audience as he sets in motion a convoluted four sided triangle between the captain, who clearly lusts after Miss Grey and Reed, who seems strangely unconcerned about the dangers to which he is subjecting his fiance.  Complicating things is a growing affection between Miss Grey and Richard Denning, who starts out as a lush but winds up as heroic.  After the appearance of the dinosaurs, the director plays overly free with hard science.  Now I know that the movie calls for a tropical island full of lumbering beasts of various sorts, but the captain did admit that the island was 10 miles around.  This would make it 100 square miles, far too little to support even a fraction of the dinosaurs on screen.  Further, as the shrunken wooley mammoths of Wrangle Island proved, that when huge beasts are cut off from the mainland to populate a much smaller land mass like an island, evolution will cause them to shrink to better fit in with a reduced land mass. Further, the island included a Dimetrodon, a fin-backed reptile that became extinct in the Permian, some 100 million years before the Cretaceous.  There was also a weird half-gorilloid species that does not fit in easily anywhere in an ecological niche.  Putting aside the aforementioned scientific blunders, UNKNOWN ISLAND worked for me because of the intense interaction among the four protagonists.  Phillip Reed as the camera man fiance comes off as an insensitive clod who does not appreciate Miss Grey.  Richard Denning grows in dramatic stature until the closing credits.  Surprisingly enough, it falls to Barton MacLane to provide the dramatic forward movement.  MacLane is oily, untrustworthy, and sleazy--but nevertheless a tough guy and courageous for that.  It is he who emerges as the film's most round character.  UNKNOWN ISLAND is good enough for its genre that it deserves to lose its ""unknown"" status to take its place as a rightful member of high class big lizard films.",1245801600,7,2729,4.895652173913043
1023861,3,6305341060,"Ive watched this film on and off for over 20 years. I like it because I enjoy lost world/dinosaur movies & B movies. This has a small group of people (4 to be exact) going on an expedition to an island to explore & photograph actual living dinosaurs. The effects in this are lousy, but I like it anyway. The Tyrannosaurus Rex dinosaurs were totally harmless looking and looked like limp rubber toys. Watch for the scene where a TRex fights a giant sloth , in homage to the 1933 epic King Kong. This comes nowhere remotely close to being as good as Kong or the 1925 Lost World, but this has a special campy lost world feel that I just enjoy. I liked that this was shot in color. This is one my guilty pleasure films. The subplot in this as a  couple about to be married that start realizing they aren't meant for each other(the man wants to be a rich photographer, while his fiancee would rather be an adventurer along with Richard Denning, the hero in this picture)

While not nearly as good as The Land Unknown, this is still a fun flick that I'm glad to have in my collection, and this Image DVD is a very good print of it.

Now granted, the monsters are pretty hokey in this one and it's clear that the ""beach"" is a studio one... but, somehow, I still liked it. This flick is sort of a King Kong rip-off with no central monster to love or to hate. So, the principals shoot at darn near every one that they see.

The best part is when the crazed captain gets his from what is called a giant sloth but is best described as a gigantopithecus.  The color is surprisingly good.
