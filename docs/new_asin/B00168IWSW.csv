3153929,5,B00168IWSW,"I really can't understand why Season 5 is so delayed.  The shows ratings were remarkable and the ratings share was something the shows of today would kill for.  Other lesser series have released the complete series, but this show has been very slow.  CBS Paramount enjoyed the success with this show (and other Gary Marshall shows) originally and now, appears to not care about the fans who have bought seasons 1-4(even pre order). Come on powers that be...good family values, a more innocent time...how can you not carry on at a reasonable pace with the release of these shows on DVD?",1246147200,3,585,4.772277227722772
3153930,4,B00168IWSW,"I love L/S until they leave for California.  Not the same.  Cowboy Bob's - not the same as Pizza Bowl.  Ed Marinaro? - annoying.  Rhonda? - very annoying.  When Shirley leaves the show?  Those are the worst episodes.  My favorite moments in Milwaukee?  - Shirley teaches Squiggy to drive, using cans, and fruit, as substitutes for the steering wheel, and break and gas peddle.  Then at one point, Shirley and Squiggy collide their tricycle and scooter and run into Boo-Boo kitty in the living room.
  Also, I like when Shirley's snobby mother visits and refers to Lenny and Squiggy as ""Squiggly and Iggly"".  I love the 'bald man' murder mystery on the train.  I love when they go on a double date with 2 little people and get BIG kisses by them at the end of the evening.  I love all the fights with Rosie Greenbaum (dunking the mink into the punch bowl).  I especially love when L/S attend a party when one of them is sleep deprived and the other is hungry.  I LOVE when the girls break into the brewery after hours to investigate something.  And at one point, they are in a huge vat of beer.  And for some reason that I cannot remember, Shirley ticks off Laverne, and Laverne tries to run after Shirley in the beer, as though to beat her up.  And of course, you can't run at all in liquid, so they are running in circles in beer in slow motion, and Shirley is screaming because Laverne is 'chasing' her.  In that same episode, the bad guys, hang them up on coat hooks.  And they try to 'jump' off the hooks even though their feet are not touching the ground.  You have to see it to see what I mean.

Worst episodes in Milwaukee?  2 downer episodes - Ted Danson as a fireman who is going to marry Laverne until he dies during a fire.  And, when Laverne's mother dies and she slaps Lenny in the face for thinking she didn't love her mother, just as he said he did not love his.",1242432000,2,1877,4.2942857142857145

3153933,5,B00168IWSW,"You might know, dang it, that Paramount would stop cranking out the Laverne and Shirley seasons only one short of that final year that the girls lived in Milwaukee (and one year before, according to many, the show jumped the shark).

Of course, the episodes that EVERY Laverne and Shirley fan longs to collect are the two parts of ""Murder on the Moosejaw Express,"" featuring guest appearances by Charlene Tilton, Wilfrid Hyde-White, and Scatman Crothers. But then there's the heartbreaking Ted Danson episode - one that I quite frankly never liked to revisit because it was so sad, but nevertheless a special episode in the series run. And the girls' visit to boot camp, run by a formidable drill sergeant played by Vicki Lawrence.

At the very least, I truly hope Paramount indulges the series' fans with just one more season. While I'd like to see the whole series released, I would settle for just one more set. For a Laverne and Shirley fan, season 5 is certainly a must-have.",1229299200,26,980,4.758823529411765

They have absolutely enjoyed season 1-4 so far.  They have even said that this show, and others like it from that time frame, are better than what is on TV now!!!  They have asked when the next season is going to be available.  Can I tell them soon??!!!!!

3153951,5,B00168IWSW,"This season is hilarious.  I seem to write that with each new season i go through but this one truly is awesome and has so many incredible episodes.  If you had to try just one season of L & S this would certainly be an excellent place to start.  The first season is tepid by comparison.  Actually season 2 is where the show first starts getting its groove on.  They've just kept getting better with each one that follows.  The writing is so good.  The show was seriously funky by this point.  It's as much a reflection of great 70s writing as it is a show about girls going through the late 50s and early 60s.  I realize in its day this was just sitcom fare, but watching these episodes now, I can't help but feel great injustice was done in never giving this show and Emmy.  The writing is so crisp, so comic.  Their singing and dancing abilities were incredible - looked at now, relics of a bygone age. Their acting and the friendship of the girls, with cohorts Lenny and Squiggy - - it's an aspect of 70s glory that while if not recognized then, can at least be recognized now.  I've been going through consecutive shows during this season.  I can't push it as far with Happy Days, but Laverne and Shirley, in this season, is really on fire.  It's not the first season either (I add again) that they've been excellent, but there are more than your average allotment of ""good ones"" in this season.",1426982400,,1400,4.355212355212355

I really like when they have more dramatic episodes, it gets to show what talented and underrated actresses Marshall and Williams are. ""What do you do with a drunken sailor"" and the Ted Danson are two episodes where the girls really shine. Powerful and touching. We get to see the love these two gals have for one another and how protective they are. What ever went on ""behind the scenes"" you'd never know it here. One highlight is Frank and Edna getting married in a black church-I think I wet my pants laughing so hard. ""Dead Lazlo's Place"" and ""Almost south of the Border"" also show some great comedic acting. A true fan has to have this season!",1397433600,,700,4.563492063492063

I finally had the money to buy the fifth season and I have to say, it was not as good as the previous four seasons, but it did have it's moments. This season delved into some very serious matters which had little to no comical elements such as death and alcoholism. My favorite ones were the episodes with Vickie Lawrence. That woman can play anything! I enjoyed many episodes on this DVD set, but I wasn't fond of the depressing ones.

3153978,5,B00168IWSW,"I used to watch ""Laverne & Shirley"" faithfully when I was a kid.  I absolutely adored the show and I still do.  I believe this was the final season before Shirley (Cindy Williams) left the show and Laverne's character moved to California.  The subsequent seasons set in California were a huge disappointment to me, so I really cherish the seasons leading up to that change.  You know a television program was outstanding when the jokes still hold up and it's still hugely entertaining after a number of years.  ""Laverne & Shirley"" certainly fits the bill.  I'm very happy with my purchase of this season and and so glad to add it to my library of great, classic television.",1360713600,2,673,4.661016949152542

3153983,3,B00168IWSW,I am sorry but this was the worst season of Laverne and Shirley ever. There were so many boring episodes its was not even funny. The slapstick is really getting ridiculous. The cross over Happy Days episode was the worst quality you could put on dvd very washed out and fade colors. The Fonze and Richie in a cow suit please and the stupid fight scenes were dumb. This will be the last l and S dvd I will buy up to season four is fun but after that its just repetitious and childish.

Carmine, Lennie and Squiggy and the girls in their humorous poverty and hilarious everyday struggles makes Laverne and Shirley a show that unlifts the common person.

3153986,5,B00168IWSW,"""Laverne & Shirley"" regardless of which season I've been viewing, always makes me laugh-out-loud with each episode. The antics the girls get into, the situations which arise, and the comedic expertise of all the cast involved, makes this a most memorable, hilarious and enjoyable season one can watch over and over. I feel this is the kind of television comedy we sorely lack in today's programming, so I enjoy going ""back in time"" and reliving some of these classics.

Both Laverne and Shirley, along with Carmine, Laverne's dad, Frank, Lenny and Squiggy, and all the other loveable characters that made this series such a success have the wonderful bond of friendship and love that underscores their various funny capers yet bonds these characters to make them each so very likeable. Each cast member is so talented and unique in their own way of comedic expression that one can't help but love them each individually. Despite all the various antics everyone gets into, they all are rooted with a strong sense of caring and love for one another - giving definitely a wonderful sense of being even in a comedy series such as this. There is a message, if even in a comedic way, that there are more important things in the world than what the outer issues appear to be. One such episode comes to mind from this particular season: the girls are chosen to spend a weekend at something like ROTC training, where they compete with the men's group to prove that females are also strong in combat and can handle themselves as well as the guys. In the end, when the girls end up saving the life of an opposing male recruit (who won't, of course, recognize that they lost the race because of saving him) they, although in their hilariously funny way, show that it's better to have lost the race of who's better/faster/longer able to exist in the cold wilderness when it means they gave up the race to save the life of an injured man. Vicki Lawrence does a fantastically funny presentation in the role of their sergeant.

Laverne & Shirley is a hilarious yet feel-good series. Sure wish there were more shows today like it!",1345248000,,2113,4.692722371967655
3153987,5,B00168IWSW,"At long last, fans of this iconic show are treated to the 'complete' fifth season on DVD. The picture looks marvelous, the sound is great, and I am personally very pleased with this release. After a somewhat disappointing fourth season (my least favorite of the series thus far), Laverne & Shirley really bounced back with the fifth season. In fact, after the second season episode 'The Haunted House', season five features my second favorite episodes of all time, the two-part 'Murder on the Moosejaw Express.' Thankfully, for once, Paramount tried to give back to their fans and gave us consumers some special treats on this release. Special features like the original episodic promos and the first part of the Happy Days mash-up episode, 'Shotgun Wedding', are a real treat for fans. To my delight, a gag reel is also included!

Really, you just can't go wrong with this show. It's as timeless now as I Love Lucy or other classic small screen comedies. There are so many wonderful episodes presented here, I can't even begin to describe them all! Yes, the music can still be an issue from time to time (as in the 'The Right to Light', when Laverne and Shirley attempt to teach Lenny and Squiggy a dance called The Monkey, the song that has been inserted is really odd), but other than a small quibbles like that, I urge you to pick this set up TODAY! You will not be disappointed. Now Paramount, bring on the last three seasons!",1343692800,2,1431,4.678571428571429
3153988,3,B00168IWSW,"I love this series, especially the first four seasons.  However although there are a few good episodes on season 5, as a whole, I could have skipped it.  The slapstick is bit over kill and it is loud and annoying.  Also Big Rosie has no episodes and she was fantastic as Lavernne's foyl.  Love Rosie!!  She should have been in more episodes.
  This is the last season that takes place in Milwaukee... the California seasons are useless.  I cannot give a stellar review for this set.  It lacked the magic of the first three seasons,,, even season four kinda waned, but as a big fan over all of the chemistry between Cindy and Penny, I had to give it a shot.",1343088000,4,656,4.355371900826446
3153989,4,B00168IWSW,"Season 5 starts with a special two-part crossover, featuring Ron Howard and Henry Winkler from Happy Days. These laughs are followed with numerous other memorable episodes, including ""You're in the Army Now,"" a two-parter guest starring Vicki Lawrence as an obnoxious sargeant when the girls are forced to leave Shotz and decide the Army might be a career option. There's also the annual Shotz Talent Show episode, full of bizarre talents, and of course, Squiggy's malapropisms, as when he dubs the Civil War ""Silverware.""

Not all episodes are slapstick and fun, however. Several are more poignant, tackling deeper issues, such as ""What Do You Do With a Drunken Sailor"" where Shirley is forced to confront the fact that her beloved older brother is an alcoholic. There's also ""The Wedding,"" where the girls' landlord Edna Babish marries Laverne's father Frank.

3153993,5,B00168IWSW,"FINALLY, after a four-year gap and believing that Laverne & Shirley was shelved indefinitely, Season 5 is upon us.  Paramount left many fans in suspense and wonder of whether or not the series had been abandoned, and I had honestly lost all hope that we'd ever see S5 released. We need not worry anymore! This long-awaited set focuses on what I(and many others)consider to be the best season yet.  The two-parter ""Murder on the Moose-Jaw Express"" will finally be seen in its entirety(not the edited version that was shown on reruns), the much anticipated ""Diner"" episode where L&S go to work for Lenny & Squiggy running a greasy-spoon diner and of course everything that can go wrong does, to the tragic ""Why did the Fireman?"" episode, starring a then unknown Ted Danson as Laverne's boyfriend who ends up being killed in the line of duty.  That particular episode displayed how versatile the characters could be at times, mixing comedy in the face of tragedy, yet somehow it seemed to work here which is more that can be said about many other TV shows today.

However, with that said, I think this should be a wrap, folks.  Frankly something changed when the series and characters moved to California, although the first season in Burbank had a few funny moments(the earthquake episode), and the girls misadventures working at Bardwell's Department Store, it was all downhill from here. The very atmosphere of the show changed.  I could never quite put my finger on it, but something just didn't seem ""right"" after the move out west. The new format, change of scenery, and chemistry between the new characters just never seemed to ""click""(I always found Rhonda(Leslie Easterbrook)to be annoying as hell and I don't think her character added much to the plot or scripts). Many agree that the show definitely lost something. I say perhaps release the 6th season as a reminder of how great the ""Milwaukee Years"" were, and then call it quits.  The show pretty much had run its course by that time. Ed Marinaro left after only 1 season in California, Betty Garrett left by 1981, Cindy Williams left in '82, and Michael McKean was missing from the final episodes. This is usually the first clue that a series is essentially on borrowed time. Everyone was jumping ship and by the time Eddie Mekka's character bid farewell to the cast, the show had honestly become unwatchable by then.

In any case, this is THE one we've all been waiting for and I'm glad CBS/Paramount finally caved in to our demands and heard our voices.  Others have previously mentioned how the series was not very well received on DVD and that's why they've been slow in coming with the subsequent releases.  Personally I think Laverne & Shirley caters to a certain demographic.  Namely Generation X'ers and their parents who grew up watching it(remember the Happy Days/Laverne&Shirley/Three's Company lineup), and working class folks who found the ""blue collar"" theme of the show easy to relate to.  Sure some of the episodes have aged better than others, and looking back now some don't seem as funny as they were back then but that's besides the point.  I think part of it is the ""kitsch"" factor too.  Or maybe perhaps you just had to be there living in that particular time to ""get it"".  Nonetheless, I'm glad we finally have Season 5 to add to our collection and can reflect on when L&S was one of the most popular and celebrated series on prime-time TV.  Thanks for listening, CBS.

ENJOY folks!",1331164800,17,3466,4.7885906040268456
3153994,5,B00168IWSW,"Season 5 was one of my favorite seasons of the series with episodes such as:
 The Diner' aka ''Betty Please'', 'Take Two, Their Small','Murder on the Moosejaw Express','Not Quite South of the Border','Upstairs, Downstairs', and my all time favorite, 'Fat City Holiday'. Why ABC moved this season to Thursday nights is beyond me. ABC pawned Tuesday nights in the late 70's and early 80's with HAPPY DAYS, LAVERNE and SHIRLEY, and THREE'S COMPANY. If it's not broken, don't fix it. Now I just wish Sony would release season 5 of CHARLIE'S ANGELS.",1330819200,2,544,4.913043478260869
3153995,5,B00168IWSW,"By far the best season.  I love this show.  I was a teen when it was on and would die if i couldn't watch it.  Moosejaw was Great. Dead  Lazlo's place was  great.  But I love the two part army episode.  Vicki Lawrence is perfect in it. But I hate that episode when they go to make an army training film.  Shirley likes that tall blond guy who she is matched up with and he says ""I'm gay.""  Hello.  This is suppose to be the late 50's early 60's.  Gay didn't mean that back then.  Plus no one would just come out and say it back then, in the late 50's early 60's.  Even the late 70's it was kind of taboo.  Look at all the flack SOAP got.  A horrible attempt to be PC.  And before ya bash me. I am gay.",1329523200,3,701,3.797202797202797
3153996,5,B00168IWSW,"Season 5 was the last funny season of Laverne & Shirley. Some of the best episodes they ever did were in season 5, including ""Why Did the Fireman"" with Ted Danson. Once they moved to LA it was downhill from there. I can't wait to get this!!!",1328659200,4,241,4.148936170212766
3153997,5,B00168IWSW,"This is by far the best year for the series. Laverne and Shirley had fallen from the Neilson Ratings top 5 shows only because ABC with all of its ""intelligence"" decided to move it to Thursdays to allow a show called Angie to have the spot after Happy Days on Tuesday nights. The late 70s and early 80s were a big time for networks to shuffle series in order to compete. Most of the time it never worked. Remember the series Taxi was moved to two different time slots on ABC then it moved to another network? Needless to say Laverne & Shirley was moved back to Tuesdays but in terms of ratings numbers it never recovered. For this season it did remain in the top 30. It's a shame because this season was when it fully hit its stride. The Diner- ""Dead Lazlo's Place"" with ""Betty please pick up your hash blacks!"" and ""Murder on the Moosejaw Express"" with ""We're knife targets for a bald guy"" and ""Frank and Edna's Wedding"" - In an African American Baptist Church are the three quintessential L & S episodes.
Laverne and Shirley was a huge hit for ABC yet I believe it was looked down upon by Hollywood. It never won a single Emmy award for acting or writing yet the public loved the show and it was number 1 for two seasons prior to this one. This is the season just before they moved to Hollywood which was when the series ""jumped the shark"" and spiraled downward with lackluster writing and Cindy Williams suing and leaving the series. Then they just let it fade away. The last episode of this huge hit centered on Carmine becoming a working actor/dancer. A forgetful end to a wonderfully funny television show that centered on two independent women navigating through life after high school. I see how shows like Friends- Monica in the fat suit, Three's Company- the physical comedy, and other shows borrowed from Laverne and Shirley which set a standard. I miss the family hour of television. I miss shows like Laverne and Shirley. I'll buy this dvd set for my kids to enjoy. Thanks for reading.",1328313600,38,1997,4.489010989010989

I seem to be in the minority, as I loved the show as it continued on the coast. Just as many good episodes as before in Season 6 and 7. Williams leaving for Season 8 trashed the final year, as often happens. When an integral character leaves, the chemistry is gone. Sign me up for Seasons 6 and 7.",1327795200,2,433,4.228915662650603

3154001,5,B00168IWSW,"Long overdue, and seemingly forgotten by Paramount, the announcement of the fifth seasons release to CBS/Paramount DVD on April 6, 2012 is a fan boy dream come true.  While I already own the series, thanks to the many airings of the syndicated versions on multiple television networks over the past twenty years, it will be great to see this great season of classic show finally be released properly and hopefully without many edits.

To Paramount's the first four seasons of what has been presented for home viewing and fans of the series, has been stunning.  Never before has the show been presented with such amazing sound, or most importantly, shined with color.  Not with standing the few music edits that have taken place, it is the most complete that the show has been presented since it's original airings when it debuted in January of 1976.

Penny Marshall and Cindy Williams are equals when it comes to delivering the laughs and physical comedy needs in line with such greats as Lucille Ball with Vivian Vance or Carol Burnett.  Michael McKean and David L. Landers are their sexual opposites.  Season five finds some of the best material for them all to share and be highlighted in.

In a season that features many wonderful high points, such as ""The Dinner"", ""Fat City Holiday"", and ""You Ought To Be In Pictures"" the cast is second to none.  This season also starts with the wonderful crossover episode from ""Happy Days"" called ""Shot Gun Wedding"" (though, to its credit, through excellent writing, the episode does stand on it's own).  Not be shy from guest stars, the two-part episode ""Murder on The Moose Jaw Express"" is a who's who of 70's Icon's such as Scatman Crothers and Charlene Tilton.  The Carol Burnett's Show very own Vicki Lawrence, arrives twice as Sgt. Alvinia T. Plout in episodes 9-10 and again episode 22.

As delighted as I am for this release, it also marks a four year lag time, almost to the date, between seasons.  I am hoping that with this renewed interest on Paramount's part, that they will not keep the fans waiting for the remaning seasons to be released.  While it is easy to site that the series `jumped the shark"" there are many episodes for which the series continues to sparkle with gang in California, plus the inclusion of the wonderful Leslie Easterbrook as Rhonda Lee.  I for one know that I am in this series all the way, including if Paramount was to go the route of a complete box set for the remaining seasons, maybe with outtakes, interviews, the reunions and the cartoon series.  I proudly have the rare vinyl of ""Laverne and Shirley Sing"" hanging in my office.

This is classic television at it's finest and with Ms. Marshall's autobiography coming this year as well, it's a great time to not only revisit but to introduce people to the girls from Scotz Bewery.  On April 10th, we should all raise a tall and frosty milk and Pepsi in honor

This is the last season to feature the girls in their original locale of Milwaukee and contains several classic episodes, perhaps the most memorable being ""The Diner"" in which Laverne and Shirley toil in a greasy spoon Lenny has inherited from his late uncle. The title of this review is a line from the episode that everyone seems to remember.

Also included among the 26 episodes to be found on this set are ""Shotgun Wedding"", which was originally the conclusion of a story arc that began on a ""Happy Days"" episode (which will be included as a Bonus Feature so we fans will get both parts); as well as two separate two-parters: ""Murder on the Moosejaw Express"" and ""You're In The Army Now"" which features Vicki Lawrence as the intimidating Seargant Plout. The girls perform ""Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay"" in the episode ""The Fourth Annual Shotz Talent Show"".

The following episodes will be included on the set and Episode Promos for ALL of them are included. The single bonus feature is a Blooper Reel which is fun but a little short at only three minutes.

Or perhaps they're going to pull a stunt like Fox did with the Mary Tyler Moore series? Whatever happens, you can bet your bottom dollar that when(and if) season 5 is released it will probably be edited, just like ""Happy Days"" was.

3388427,4,B00168IWSW,"I love L/S until they leave for California.  Not the same.  Cowboy Bob's - not the same as Pizza Bowl.  Ed Marinaro? - annoying.  Rhonda? - very annoying.  When Shirley leaves the show?  Those are the worst episodes.  My favorite moments in Milwaukee?  - Shirley teaches Squiggy to drive, using cans, and fruit, as substitutes for the steering wheel, and break and gas peddle.  Then at one point, Shirley and Squiggy collide their tricycle and scooter and run into Boo-Boo kitty in the living room.
  Also, I like when Shirley's snobby mother visits and refers to Lenny and Squiggy as ""Squiggly and Iggly"".  I love the 'bald man' murder mystery on the train.  I love when they go on a double date with 2 little people and get BIG kisses by them at the end of the evening.  I love all the fights with Rosie Greenbaum (dunking the mink into the punch bowl).  I especially love when L/S attend a party when one of them is sleep deprived and the other is hungry.  I LOVE when the girls break into the brewery after hours to investigate something.  And at one point, they are in a huge vat of beer.  And for some reason that I cannot remember, Shirley ticks off Laverne, and Laverne tries to run after Shirley in the beer, as though to beat her up.  And of course, you can't run at all in liquid, so they are running in circles in beer in slow motion, and Shirley is screaming because Laverne is 'chasing' her.  In that same episode, the bad guys, hang them up on coat hooks.  And they try to 'jump' off the hooks even though their feet are not touching the ground.  You have to see it to see what I mean.

Worst episodes in Milwaukee?  2 downer episodes - Ted Danson as a fireman who is going to marry Laverne until he dies during a fire.

3388430,5,B00168IWSW,"You might know, dang it, that Paramount would stop cranking out the Laverne and Shirley seasons only one short of that final year that the girls lived in Milwaukee (and one year before, according to many, the show jumped the shark).

Of course, the episodes that EVERY Laverne and Shirley fan longs to collect are the two parts of ""Murder on the Moosejaw Express,"" featuring guest appearances by Charlene Tilton, Wilfrid Hyde-White, and Scatman Crothers. But then there's the heartbreaking Ted Danson episode - one that I quite frankly never liked to revisit because it was so sad, but nevertheless a special episode in the series run. And the girls' visit to boot camp, run by a formidable drill sergeant played by Vicki Lawrence.

At the very least, I truly hope Paramount indulges the series' fans with just one more season. While I'd like to see the whole series released, I would settle for just one more set. For a Laverne and Shirley fan, season 5 is certainly a must-have.",1229299200,26,980,4.758823529411765

If you had to try just one season of L & S this would certainly be an excellent place to start.  The first season is tepid by comparison.  Actually season 2 is where the show first starts getting its groove on.  They've just kept getting better with each one that follows.  The writing is so good.  The show was seriously funky by this point.  It's as much a reflection of great 70s writing as it is a show about girls going through the late 50s and early 60s.  I realize in its day this was just sitcom fare, but watching these episodes now, I can't help but feel great injustice was done in never giving this show and Emmy.  The writing is so crisp, so comic.  Their singing and dancing abilities were incredible - looked at now, relics of a bygone age. Their acting and the friendship of the girls, with cohorts Lenny and Squiggy - - it's an aspect of 70s glory that while if not recognized then, can at least be recognized now.  I've been going through consecutive shows during this season.  I can't push it as far with Happy Days, but Laverne and Shirley, in this season, is really on fire.  It's not the first season either (I add again) that they've been excellent, but there are more than your average allotment of ""good ones"" in this season.",1426982400,,1400,4.355212355212355

The subsequent seasons set in California were a huge disappointment to me, so I really cherish the seasons leading up to that change.  You know a television program was outstanding when the jokes still hold up and it's still hugely entertaining after a number of years.  ""Laverne & Shirley"" certainly fits the bill.

3388483,5,B00168IWSW,"""Laverne & Shirley"" regardless of which season I've been viewing, always makes me laugh-out-loud with each episode. The antics the girls get into, the situations which arise, and the comedic expertise of all the cast involved, makes this a most memorable, hilarious and enjoyable season one can watch over and over. I feel this is the kind of television comedy we sorely lack in today's programming, so I enjoy going ""back in time"" and reliving some of these classics.

Both Laverne and Shirley, along with Carmine, Laverne's dad, Frank, Lenny and Squiggy, and all the other loveable characters that made this series such a success have the wonderful bond of friendship and love that underscores their various funny capers yet bonds these characters to make them each so very likeable. Each cast member is so talented and unique in their own way of comedic expression that one can't help but love them each individually. Despite all the various antics everyone gets into, they all are rooted with a strong sense of caring and love for one another - giving definitely a wonderful sense of being even in a comedy series such as this. There is a message, if even in a comedic way, that there are more important things in the world than what the outer issues appear to be. One such episode comes to mind from this particular season: the girls are chosen to spend a weekend at something like ROTC training, where they compete with the men's group to prove that females are also strong in combat and can handle themselves as well as the guys. In the end, when the girls end up saving the life of an opposing male recruit (who won't, of course, recognize that they lost the race because of saving him) they, although in their hilariously funny way, show that it's better to have lost the race of who's better/faster/longer able to exist in the cold wilderness when it means they gave up the race to save the life of an injured man. Vicki Lawrence does a fantastically funny presentation in the role of their sergeant.

Laverne & Shirley is a hilarious yet feel-good series. Sure wish there were more shows today like it!",1345248000,,2113,4.692722371967655
3388484,5,B00168IWSW,"At long last, fans of this iconic show are treated to the 'complete' fifth season on DVD. The picture looks marvelous, the sound is great, and I am personally very pleased with this release. After a somewhat disappointing fourth season (my least favorite of the series thus far), Laverne & Shirley really bounced back with the fifth season. In fact, after the second season episode 'The Haunted House', season five features my second favorite episodes of all time, the two-part 'Murder on the Moosejaw Express.' Thankfully, for once, Paramount tried to give back to their fans and gave us consumers some special treats on this release. Special features like the original episodic promos and the first part of the Happy Days mash-up episode, 'Shotgun Wedding', are a real treat for fans. To my delight, a gag reel is also included!

Really, you just can't go wrong with this show. It's as timeless now as I Love Lucy or other classic small screen comedies. There are so many wonderful episodes presented here, I can't even begin to describe them all! Yes, the music can still be an issue from time to time (as in the 'The Right to Light', when Laverne and Shirley attempt to teach Lenny and Squiggy a dance called The Monkey, the song that has been inserted is really odd), but other than a small quibbles like that, I urge you to pick this set up TODAY! You will not be disappointed. Now Paramount, bring on the last three seasons!",1343692800,2,1431,4.678571428571429

The slapstick is bit over kill and it is loud and annoying.  Also Big Rosie has no episodes and she was fantastic as Lavernne's foyl.  Love Rosie!!  She should have been in more episodes.
  This is the last season that takes place in Milwaukee... the California seasons are useless.  I cannot give a stellar review for this set.  It lacked the magic of the first three seasons,,, even season four kinda waned, but as a big fan over all of the chemistry between Cindy and Penny, I had to give it a shot.",1343088000,4,656,4.355371900826446
3388486,4,B00168IWSW,"Season 5 starts with a special two-part crossover, featuring Ron Howard and Henry Winkler from Happy Days. These laughs are followed with numerous other memorable episodes, including ""You're in the Army Now,"" a two-parter guest starring Vicki Lawrence as an obnoxious sargeant when the girls are forced to leave Shotz and decide the Army might be a career option. There's also the annual Shotz Talent Show episode, full of bizarre talents, and of course, Squiggy's malapropisms, as when he dubs the Civil War ""Silverware.""

Not all episodes are slapstick and fun, however. Several are more poignant, tackling deeper issues, such as ""What Do You Do With a Drunken Sailor"" where Shirley is forced to confront the fact that her beloved older brother is an alcoholic. There's also ""The Wedding,"" where the girls' landlord Edna Babish marries Laverne's father Frank.

3388490,5,B00168IWSW,"FINALLY, after a four-year gap and believing that Laverne & Shirley was shelved indefinitely, Season 5 is upon us.  Paramount left many fans in suspense and wonder of whether or not the series had been abandoned, and I had honestly lost all hope that we'd ever see S5 released. We need not worry anymore! This long-awaited set focuses on what I(and many others)consider to be the best season yet.  The two-parter ""Murder on the Moose-Jaw Express"" will finally be seen in its entirety(not the edited version that was shown on reruns), the much anticipated ""Diner"" episode where L&S go to work for Lenny & Squiggy running a greasy-spoon diner and of course everything that can go wrong does, to the tragic ""Why did the Fireman?"" episode, starring a then unknown Ted Danson as Laverne's boyfriend who ends up being killed in the line of duty.  That particular episode displayed how versatile the characters could be at times, mixing comedy in the face of tragedy, yet somehow it seemed to work here which is more that can be said about many other TV shows today.

However, with that said, I think this should be a wrap, folks.  Frankly something changed when the series and characters moved to California, although the first season in Burbank had a few funny moments(the earthquake episode), and the girls misadventures working at Bardwell's Department Store, it was all downhill from here. The very atmosphere of the show changed.  I could never quite put my finger on it, but something just didn't seem ""right"" after the move out west. The new format, change of scenery, and chemistry between the new characters just never seemed to ""click""(I always found Rhonda(Leslie Easterbrook)to be annoying as hell and I don't think her character added much to the plot or scripts). Many agree that the show definitely lost something. I say perhaps release the 6th season as a reminder of how great the ""Milwaukee Years"" were, and then call it quits.  The show pretty much had run its course by that time. Ed Marinaro left after only 1 season in California, Betty Garrett left by 1981, Cindy Williams left in '82, and Michael McKean was missing from the final episodes. This is usually the first clue that a series is essentially on borrowed time. Everyone was jumping ship and by the time Eddie Mekka's character bid farewell to the cast, the show had honestly become unwatchable by then.

In any case, this is THE one we've all been waiting for and I'm glad CBS/Paramount finally caved in to our demands and heard our voices.  Others have previously mentioned how the series was not very well received on DVD and that's why they've been slow in coming with the subsequent releases.  Personally I think Laverne & Shirley caters to a certain demographic.  Namely Generation X'ers and their parents who grew up watching it(remember the Happy Days/Laverne&Shirley/Three's Company lineup), and working class folks who found the ""blue collar"" theme of the show easy to relate to.  Sure some of the episodes have aged better than others, and looking back now some don't seem as funny as they were back then but that's besides the point.  I think part of it is the ""kitsch"" factor too.  Or maybe perhaps you just had to be there living in that particular time to ""get it"".  Nonetheless, I'm glad we finally have Season 5 to add to our collection and can reflect on when L&S was one of the most popular and celebrated series on prime-time TV.  Thanks for listening, CBS.

ENJOY folks!",1331164800,17,3466,4.7885906040268456
3388491,5,B00168IWSW,"Season 5 was one of my favorite seasons of the series with episodes such as:
 The Diner' aka ''Betty Please'', 'Take Two, Their Small','Murder on the Moosejaw Express','Not Quite South of the Border','Upstairs, Downstairs', and my all time favorite, 'Fat City Holiday'. Why ABC moved this season to Thursday nights is beyond me. ABC pawned Tuesday nights in the late 70's and early 80's with HAPPY DAYS, LAVERNE and SHIRLEY, and THREE'S COMPANY. If it's not broken, don't fix it. Now I just wish Sony would release season 5 of CHARLIE'S ANGELS.",1330819200,2,544,4.913043478260869
3388492,5,B00168IWSW,"By far the best season.  I love this show.  I was a teen when it was on and would die if i couldn't watch it.  Moosejaw was Great. Dead  Lazlo's place was  great.  But I love the two part army episode.  Vicki Lawrence is perfect in it. But I hate that episode when they go to make an army training film.  Shirley likes that tall blond guy who she is matched up with and he says ""I'm gay.""  Hello.  This is suppose to be the late 50's early 60's.  Gay didn't mean that back then.  Plus no one would just come out and say it back then, in the late 50's early 60's.  Even the late 70's it was kind of taboo.  Look at all the flack SOAP got.  A horrible attempt to be PC.  And before ya bash me. I am gay.",1329523200,3,701,3.797202797202797
3388493,5,B00168IWSW,"Season 5 was the last funny season of Laverne & Shirley. Some of the best episodes they ever did were in season 5, including ""Why Did the Fireman"" with Ted Danson. Once they moved to LA it was downhill from there. I can't wait to get this!!!",1328659200,4,241,4.148936170212766
3388494,5,B00168IWSW,"This is by far the best year for the series. Laverne and Shirley had fallen from the Neilson Ratings top 5 shows only because ABC with all of its ""intelligence"" decided to move it to Thursdays to allow a show called Angie to have the spot after Happy Days on Tuesday nights. The late 70s and early 80s were a big time for networks to shuffle series in order to compete. Most of the time it never worked. Remember the series Taxi was moved to two different time slots on ABC then it moved to another network? Needless to say Laverne & Shirley was moved back to Tuesdays but in terms of ratings numbers it never recovered. For this season it did remain in the top 30. It's a shame because this season was when it fully hit its stride. The Diner- ""Dead Lazlo's Place"" with ""Betty please pick up your hash blacks!"" and ""Murder on the Moosejaw Express"" with ""We're knife targets for a bald guy"" and ""Frank and Edna's Wedding"" - In an African American Baptist Church are the three quintessential L & S episodes.
Laverne and Shirley was a huge hit for ABC yet I believe it was looked down upon by Hollywood. It never won a single Emmy award for acting or writing yet the public loved the show and it was number 1 for two seasons prior to this one. This is the season just before they moved to Hollywood which was when the series ""jumped the shark"" and spiraled downward with lackluster writing and Cindy Williams suing and leaving the series. Then they just let it fade away. The last episode of this huge hit centered on Carmine becoming a working actor/dancer. A forgetful end to a wonderfully funny television show that centered on two independent women navigating through life after high school. I see how shows like Friends- Monica in the fat suit, Three's Company- the physical comedy, and other shows borrowed from Laverne and Shirley which set a standard. I miss the family hour of television. I miss shows like Laverne and Shirley. I'll buy this dvd set for my kids to enjoy. Thanks for reading.",1328313600,38,1997,4.489010989010989

3388496,5,B00168IWSW,"It's about time. The show continued to get better. The girls last show in their Milwaukee digs and then its 'California, here we come'. I seem to be in the minority, as I loved the show as it continued on the coast. Just as many good episodes as before in Season 6 and 7. Williams leaving for Season 8 trashed the final year, as often happens. When an integral character leaves, the chemistry is gone. Sign me up for Seasons 6 and 7.",1327795200,2,433,4.228915662650603

Aside from my favorite 2-parter, Murder on the Moosejaw, there is, of course, the classic featuring those hash...blacks, haha.  But one of my favorites, and the ONE I haven't seen in YEARS - is The Wedding - where L&S get more than carried away singing in the chorus & Shirl wonders who is singing with them, and Laverne remarks, ""Well, they aint my relatives from Brooklyn."" HILARIOUS!!!  Can't wait!!!!!  :D",1326672000,3,460,4.7
3388498,5,B00168IWSW,"Long overdue, and seemingly forgotten by Paramount, the announcement of the fifth seasons release to CBS/Paramount DVD on April 6, 2012 is a fan boy dream come true.  While I already own the series, thanks to the many airings of the syndicated versions on multiple television networks over the past twenty years, it will be great to see this great season of classic show finally be released properly and hopefully without many edits.

To Paramount's the first four seasons of what has been presented for home viewing and fans of the series, has been stunning.  Never before has the show been presented with such amazing sound, or most importantly, shined with color.  Not with standing the few music edits that have taken place, it is the most complete that the show has been presented since it's original airings when it debuted in January of 1976.

Penny Marshall and Cindy Williams are equals when it comes to delivering the laughs and physical comedy needs in line with such greats as Lucille Ball with Vivian Vance or Carol Burnett.  Michael McKean and David L. Landers are their sexual opposites.  Season five finds some of the best material for them all to share and be highlighted in.

In a season that features many wonderful high points, such as ""The Dinner"", ""Fat City Holiday"", and ""You Ought To Be In Pictures"" the cast is second to none.  This season also starts with the wonderful crossover episode from ""Happy Days"" called ""Shot Gun Wedding"" (though, to its credit, through excellent writing, the episode does stand on it's own).  Not be shy from guest stars, the two-part episode ""Murder on The Moose Jaw Express"" is a who's who of 70's Icon's such as Scatman Crothers and Charlene Tilton.  The Carol Burnett's Show very own Vicki Lawrence, arrives twice as Sgt. Alvinia T. Plout in episodes 9-10 and again episode 22.

As delighted as I am for this release, it also marks a four year lag time, almost to the date, between seasons.  I am hoping that with this renewed interest on Paramount's part, that they will not keep the fans waiting for the remaning seasons to be released.  While it is easy to site that the series `jumped the shark"" there are many episodes for which the series continues to sparkle with gang in California, plus the inclusion of the wonderful Leslie Easterbrook as Rhonda Lee.  I for one know that I am in this series all the way, including if Paramount was to go the route of a complete box set for the remaining seasons, maybe with outtakes, interviews, the reunions and the cartoon series.  I proudly have the rare vinyl of ""Laverne and Shirley Sing"" hanging in my office.

This is classic television at it's finest and with Ms. Marshall's autobiography coming this year as well, it's a great time to not only revisit but to introduce people to the girls from Scotz Bewery.  On April 10th, we should all raise a tall and frosty milk and Pepsi in honor

3388500,5,B00168IWSW,"I was dead-certain ""Laverne & Shirley"" was stalled indefinitely on DVD because it's been four long years since Season Four was released, but CBS shocked everybody by announcing Season Five will come out April 10, 2012.

This is the last season to feature the girls in their original locale of Milwaukee and contains several classic episodes, perhaps the most memorable being ""The Diner"" in which Laverne and Shirley toil in a greasy spoon Lenny has inherited from his late uncle. The title of this review is a line from the episode that everyone seems to remember.

Also included among the 26 episodes to be found on this set are ""Shotgun Wedding"", which was originally the conclusion of a story arc that began on a ""Happy Days"" episode (which will be included as a Bonus Feature so we fans will get both parts); as well as two separate two-parters: ""Murder on the Moosejaw Express"" and ""You're In The Army Now"" which features Vicki Lawrence as the intimidating Seargant Plout. The girls perform ""Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay"" in the episode ""The Fourth Annual Shotz Talent Show"".

The following episodes will be included on the set and Episode Promos for ALL of them are included. The single bonus feature is a Blooper Reel which is fun but a little short at only three minutes.

With all the awful cheap crap that's out there on DVD couldn't these at least be outsourced so the fans could get our hands on them?

3388511,5,B00168IWSW,"This is typical of how big studios operate, and why I'm becoming increasingly frustrated and disillusioned with supporting them.  What is the problem, Paramount?  Of course it figures you're going to cheat us out of the best season that contains some of the most memorable episodes: (Murder on the Moose-Jaw Express, Why Did the Fireman?, and The Diner--just to name a few). Or perhaps they're going to pull a stunt like Fox did with the Mary Tyler Moore series? Whatever happens, you can bet your bottom dollar that when(and if) season 5 is released it will probably be edited, just like ""Happy Days"" was.  In summary, I never thought much of Paramount and this is just one reason why.  As far as Laverne and Shirley goes, I agree with the other reviewers.  I could careless about the California episodes.  Let's just release the last season of the ""Milwaukee Years"" and call it quits.  It was all downhill after that anyway.  Come on Paramount. Get with the program--literally.
