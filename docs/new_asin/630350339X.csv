7848773,5,630350339X,I use this video in my college classroom to introduce my students to the concept of the Hero Journey story and Joseph Campbell's Hero with a Thousand Faces. It is a great starting point for the journey into his ideas.,1224892800,,217,4.45
7848774,5,630350339X,"A hero is, ""someone who has found or achieved or done something beyond the normal range of achievement and experience.""  Campbell goes on to illuminate the hero sequence, loosely explained here as: departure  (from the comfortable range of experience);  trials (transformation of  consciousness and revelation); fulfillment (enlightenment); and return.  For the western intellectual, Joseph Campbell can seem disturbingly  unsettling.
One cannot deny the breadth of his cultural connection to  mythologies of many different human traditions.  He can carry on in a very  intense almost hypnotic associational mode of dialogue switching from one  mythological system to another making striking and compelling analogies  between them.  It makes taking notes from him quite a challenge, and  listening in rapture quite easy.  He describes mythology as an interface  with the source of life.  Campbell seems to have mastered this interface  quite well.  He sees himself as a maverick in intellectual terms, and this  maverick nature seems to even manifest in subtly anti-intellectual  terms.
In this video, Star Wars presents the recurrent western example  that Moyers and Campbell both return to, though he also connects into  Christianity and other western pagan mythologies.  At one point Campbell  analogizes Darth Vader and the ""dark side"" to the intellectual  side of humanity.  I must admit, that this still disturbs me, though I can  honestly say that this disturbs me as much for state of western  intellectual traditions as it does for Joseph Campbell's attitude toward  the state of this tradition.  I wish that Campbell could appreciate some of  the cognitive breakthroughs that have occurred since his death within  western intellectualism in the works of Lakoff and Johnson, hinted at in  ""Metaphors we Live By"" and partially fulfilled in  ""Philosophy in the Flesh"", and independently through the theology  of Don Cupitt laid out in ""After God: The Future of Religion""  (all three also reviewed by me).
This video represents my first firsthand  encounter with Joseph Campbell, though I have encountered overwhelming  references to him before.  Though I felt disturbed, challenged, and  enlightened, I felt no disappointment in it.  Throughout the video, I felt  as though I had listened to a child prodigy caught in the body of an older  man, with a vitality and imagination that defies rational criticism.  He  endures as a fascinating storyteller with a great intuition in finding the  power in those stories.  In this, I think any intellectual can envy him in  his broad expertise in this fading spontaneous art form.
""We have  not even to risk the adventure alone, for the heroes of all time have gone  before us.  The labyrinth is thoroughly known.  We have only to follow the  thread of the hero path.  And where we had thought to find an abomination,  we shall find a god; and where we had thought to slay another we shall slay  ourselves; where we had thought to travel outward, we shall come to the  center of our own existence; and where we had thought to be alone, we shall  be with all the world.""
Such passages weave seamlessly into the  visual accompaniment to Joseph Campbell's words, and the work truly  transports us into the soul of the hero to gather strength for our own  lives.",958348800,23,3307,5.126415094339623
