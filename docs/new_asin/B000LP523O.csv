8162688,4,B000LP523O,"Not a bad video. It is in Chinese, but the English subtitles are easy to follow. It starts with the 12 animal forms, with an explanation of each. Then it moves to the 5 fists, with an explanation of each (and different versions of doing the fists). It then finishes with the 5 fist linking form.

Not bad at all.",1335830400,,312,4.2
8162689,5,B000LP523O,"Having studied Hsing i in Taiwan, my first impression was the stylistic differences between the Dragon Style I learned and the 'sliding' low strike presented here.  That said, the footwork explanations are great -- and the real difference between the five elements and the animals are accentuated footwork and handwork variations (each of the animals is based in the five initial moves).

You won't learn hsing i from a DVD: you'll still need a decent instructor to explain and deconstruct the forms -- and some sparring interaction -- but for learning the forms and some interesting stylistic variations (explained in detail on this DVD) this product can't be beat.",1243555200,2,666,5.10091743119266
8162690,3,B000LP523O,"The DVD is Chinese with English subtitles. There were reasonably frequent chapter markers, but it still required a fair bit of rewinding and fast forwarding to focus on specific areas. The twelve styles were presented first, before the five elements, which seemed counter-intuitive. Some attention is given to instruction but it is predominantly a demonstration of forms (often multiple forms per style/element).

I am not qualified to comment on the quality of the Xing Yi, but the demonstrations were clearly presented, from a couple angles, and were very thorough. A beginner could follow most of the forms. The practice forms did not look overly ornate either - very practically oriented. There was no instruction concerning applications (at least in the subtitles).

This was good value for me. I would have liked better DVD navigation and some more instructional material for a five star rating, but it was worth the very reasonable price.",1186272000,5,945,5.2105263157894735
