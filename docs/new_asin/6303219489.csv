7841392,5,6303219489,"This rare Hanna-Barbera Christmas classic stars the masterminds of the company themselves, Bill Hanna and Joe Barbera, hosting a Christmas party to a gang of kids, with traditional Christmas songs AND some from their earlier Christmas specials, plus an exclusive song made just for this video (That being ""Hey Now"", at the beginning and the end credits). I don't know why, but only a few of the songs have their lyrics on the screen; why not all of them, like Disney's Sing Along Songs usually did? This is yet another Hanna-Barbera Christmas classic that's never been on DVD as of 2015, but many of the specials seen and heard in this one are on authorized DVDs of their own, except The Nativity of course. Like with The Nativity, I also found Hanna-Barbera's Christmas Sing-A-Long on VHS online and quite enjoyed it. I'd previously seen it on YouTube in 2008, and hoped to get it on DVD someday (the Warner Archive isn't listening to us about this and The Greatest Adventure series for once). Be it on VHS or DVD, this special program is always a Yabba-Dabba-Doo Yule Time for kids AND grownups! It's a wonder that most of the KidSongs volumes on VHS are now on DVD, but most of Disney's Sing Along Songs volumes remain unavailable on DVD since fall 2006! That's even nuttier than Cindy Bear with mistletoe, as her song from Yogi's First Christmas is in this program! Merry Christmas to y'all!",1418774400,2,1395,4.697959183673469
