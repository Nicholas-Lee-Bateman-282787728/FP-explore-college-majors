2153665,4,B0002ZMIV2,"Courage to love provides a fascinating insight to a little known period in Louisiana's history. A period when free women of colour were groomed by their mothers for the sole purpose of finding a rich man to take care of them- though due to Louisiana law, were unable to marry. Venessa Williams gives a good performance as a ""gens de colour."" I highly recommend.",1121126400,27,361,4.65625
2153666,4,B0002ZMIV2,"very attractive and talented Creole woman named Henriette Delille, who chose the rigors of convent life over a very comfortable placage with a wealthy white benefactor who could gave her the world if she wants it.  She saw the evil in placage and didn't want any part of it because it would be against God's law against living in sin.  She seen it firsthand with her parents.  Her father wanted out of it so he could marry a white woman in order to have legitimate offspring while her mother slowly goes insane not only of her lover's abandonment but also of her daughter's refusal to follow her footsteps in taking a white lover without being married.

All her life, Henriette deLille devoted her life to helping the poor and enslaved of Louisiana, even going against the authorities to do so.  It's not an easy life to live but it's a purposeful one. One that emphasize a life of service and devotion to spiritual matters.

Vanessa L. Williams has done a great job in portraying Henriette Delille.",1105228800,68,999,4.6477272727272725

2153700,1,B0002ZMIV2,"New Orleans suffered extensively in 2005 by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. it was times of devastation as we follow up with the loss of precious lives and horrors that are still part of the area because the flooding broke a special location and city with damages from loss of weaker residential areas creating homeless people who will have to deal with disastrous economical status. It makes me angry that many of the politicians and the various offices and organizations, all whom were scandalously late in preparing New Orleans but also response during the crisis I cannot discuss. What was shocking to me is the reaction and redevelopment of NO as a city after health and crisis management did their work. The people were neglected and so did everything else.
- This poorly written, acted, and directed C grade movie reminded what was lost of rich News Orleans over the age. The damaged houses and many landmarks were erased but were not standard poverty housing arrangements. The less wealthy actually created housings and arranged for practicality in conducting the construction of New Orleans. Before Louisiana was meddled with as an ambition, New Orleans has already established itself as a city and a port that was the talk of US. Paris historically in the last few centuries was the icon of fashion, romantic languages, art, and intellect. The sea access created a beautiful new allow of cultural originality. everyone tried to engulf their manners and fashion according to social classes like Europeans. Still less fortunate citizens understood how to create structures respecting symmetry, stability, and rejecting the crude concrete of the cities beyond. Similarly sirens of beautiful offspring resulted from the peaceful coexistence of a number of settlers. The women were specially desired because of their exotic skin colour and the actual enhancement of beauty and accomplishment.

THE MOVIE SUDDENLY INTRODUCES a set of EXTENSIVE TOPICS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN REPLACED BY THE FUSION OF MUSIC AND FOOD even early on that will stay special because of the French. They hinted that black individuals was not an issue until the US both politically ans socially moved there. The movie suddenly makes the gorgeous mixed race women as concubines under US law? They cannot bare legitimate children but are accepted into society? They started introducing rape and religion in a strange way. They are saints and the main character who was the sensible sister of two, thinks she has a religious gift because an 18 century well educated lady in love with a physician would suddenly fight with him about the uselessness of medicine.
Her doctor suitor likes her but decides to move to Paris in a time of so much change because his parents he thinks will not approve. As if he a noble who needs an heiress. The main character abandons her mother and leaves the house like she is in the 21st century because she simply wants her best at that time which is a better husband than her father. The way she ill treats  her mom for a while shows how immature she is. Finally, I stopped watching when the main character who teaches black children ABC and is a saint and a nun, refusing indulgence, finds nothing wrong with sleeping wth the doctor.

2153741,5,B0002ZMIV2,"Courage to Love is a poignant, historically-accurate portrayal of one womans strength to stand up for her beliefs, all the while surrounded by the pleadings of others to abandon them.  This is not your typical love story.

In this saga, Vanessa Williams perfectly portrays the compelling story of Henriette Delille, a young Creole turned Catholic nun who lived in pre-Civil War New Orleans. While it was customary and acceptable in Henriettes world for women of mixed races to become the paid concubines of the local aristocracy, Henriette could not in good conscience do the same. A woman of conviction and intelligence, she found herself opposed to these practices, which seemed to stand in direct contrast to the values her faith embodied.

Not satisfied with the notion of following her mothers and sisters footsteps by allowing herself to be sold to the highest bidder, Henriette sought solace and acceptance in the church where she served as a primary teacher. Her desire to help others at the expense of her own happiness is a demonstration of the highest form of love one can find in this life. It is only when Delille found the courage to love others more than herself that she realized her purpose in life.

While the story begins rather stiltedly, viewers will soon find themselves captured by the characters in this movie. The costumes, music, and setting of this film work harmoniously together to depict what starts as the fairy tale love story of Henriette and Gerard, her twin-souled earthly love, and ends as a depiction of an even greater affection for others, rather than ones self.

This feel-good movie will leave viewers wanting to know more about the seldom spoke of practice of placage, from the French word placer  meaning to place with. This practice lasted from the 17th through the 19th century in New Orleans and throughout the Caribbean. Men would place themselves with these other women  pledging to financially support them, for a time - outside of marriage.  The resulting practice allowed these men to lead double-lives with two families  one comprised of quadroon outcasts, and the other, socially acceptable white households.

Both Williams and Gil Bellows, who plays her French soul-mate, are believable and captivating in the characters they embody.  Supporting cast members provide depth to the movie as viewers wonder how Henriettes priest, parents, and community will react to her dilemma. Will she follow her heart and run away to marry her beloved French doctor, or will she remain true to her calling and support those who need her in New Orleans? The results may be predictable on the movie screen, but the real life drama makes this plot-line all the more unforgettable.

This film is a pure joy to behold. Its lessons will remain with viewers long after the closing credits have run.",1484438400,15,2830,4.985138004246284

2153759,3,B0002ZMIV2,"[Spoiler Alert!]  It would be interesting to know how much of this film, which is based upon a true storyis fact, and how much embellished. The movie, about a mixed race woman who tries to shirk the societal status quo but encountersprejudice and injustice-- while also growing in her commitment to the church--is inspiring but the romantic aspect is a disappointment.

Iftold rightly, the audience would somehow approve of the heroine's choice to spurn love for thesake of her calling. The problem is, we don't. Was the romance embellished forthe film? One wonders. Because it would more fittingly be called, The Courage to Forsake Love, unless it is love of God referred to.

In other aspects, it's a rewarding story, (period ambiance, costume, history)but the romance is made too much of for the outcome to be considered a happy ending. If you don't need a thoroughly happy ending, then consider it a four star film.",1482969600,2,919,4.916129032258064

I find it interesting that the cover of the film depicts Henriette standing courageously while the doctor she loved is far behind. This is just one aspect of Henriette's courage that is displayed in the movie. Courage is one of Henriette's main strengths, as you will see. I am so glad I found this gem on Amazon!",1478390400,10,470,4.607142857142857

The one exception in Keach, who plays her father, but he isn't in enough scenes to make much of a difference. Secondly, sorry, but she is too old for the part. She was hardly the ""budding"" Creole debutant she was portrayed to be. Lastly, it was not historically accurate. Slaves could not just leave the plantation whenever they wanted to and go visit around town. That is an insult to the men and women who lived through that time period.

2154047,3,B0002ZMIV2,"The Courage of Love progressed like a true made-for-tv movie. It was enjoyable, but in the way of a movie that you might watch on a sick day or a lazy Sunday afternoon with nothing else to do.

Vanessa Williams plays Henriette Delille, a young woman who finds herself dissatisfied with the status quo of her life.  As a mixed-race woman in New Orleans, Louisiana, Henriette is destined to a life as a mistress to wealthy white man.  In fact, she was raised to be the perfect companion for such a man.  Henriette does not abhor the idea of loving a white man. She has a loving relationship with her white father and her status in her community does not lead her to feel any contempt for the white people around. She just hates the thought of being an unrecognized or illegitimate lover/partner to any man. This resolution seems to be caused by both her pride and her increasing devotion to God. In the early 1800s, blacks (even those of mixed race) and whites were not permitted to marry each other, and Henriette does not want to offend God by not marrying the man she chooses to be with.  Henriette subtly rages against the expectations of her parents, and decides not to take on a lover/benefactor. Instead, she meets a young white doctor, Dr. Gerard Gautier, and falls in love with him. Despite their love and mutual respect for each other, laws and societal attitudes make being together difficult.  Furthermore, Henriette relationship with God deepens while caring for the disenfranchised slaves in her community. Henriette must ultimately choose between God, love, and her community.

Vanessa Williams did a wonderful job portraying Henriette.  She conveyed the conviction, boldness, and strength inherent in the character.  Unfortunately, as another reviewer noted, Williams appeared a bit old for the role. She looked significantly older than the actress playing her older sister. And for that reason, it detracted from the story. Gil Bellows who played Williams' love interest, Dr. Gautier, was fortunate to be cast as the near perfect man. He is faithful and dedicated, which makes him swoon-worthy. My only complaint was that there was something a bit off about his French accent; it seemed a tad over the top, which was distracting.  The real treat of this film was the appearance of Ms. Diahann Carroll, as Henriette's mother. She is a truly great actress, and she was underused in this film.

This movie was not great.  It progressed a bit too slowly, and at times seemed unrealistic. For instance, at one point in the film, Henriette goes to a white slave owner's home while he is entertaining guests and confronts him about raping one of his slaves.  She also spoke back frequently to the white members of her community.  This film was based on a true story, but it's hard to believe that a black women, a mixed woman, or even a white woman could have gotten away with such behavior in 1813. I hope every bit of this movie was true, but it felt like the history was softened for this telling of the story.

Nevertheless, I don't regret taking the time to watch this film. It is always a pleasure to watch Diahann Carroll and Vanessa Williams perform. I'll always make some time for a cast of this caliber.  Furthermore, because of the film, I really want to learn more about Henriette Delille and her 1813 New Orleans community.  This wasn't the best film.  However, it was entertaining, which is enough for me to suggest you give it a watch.",1451520000,4,3458,4.74457429048414

But the big issues of racial privilege and disparity, treatment of the poor, health care for the needy, etc that are so relevant to today weren't fully explored in this film, but rather just kind of glossed over, as if the producers were running out of budget or the writer couldn't figure out how to interweave the story of a real person with the climate of her times and ours.

You come away from this movie wishing you personally knew and worked with many of the characters.  It reminds us, also, that the Lord gives us strength and perseverance when we place our trust in Him.  Definitely worth the watch.

In fact, I think this movie is so well done that it could be a very interesting series about New Orleans and the times. It's such an interesting area of the country and the dynamics of the cultural clashes that exist between the Europeans that were there, the freed people of color, the slaves and the American settlers that arrived later, is really interesting!

The dialogue was stilted, the characters one-dimensional, and sadly, the beautiful Miss Vanessa Williams was too old for her part (which I hate saying because I think she is amazingly beautiful). I just couldn't imagine her as a blossoming young lady. :-(

I soldiered on and watched the movie in its entirety because I'm stubborn. I wanted to movie to redeem itself in the end. *sigh* I should have let go of the dream. The movie petered out to a slow ending that gave me no satisfaction.

2154194,4,B0002ZMIV2,"Henriette DeLille was an American nun who founded the Roman Catholic order of the Sisters of the Holy Family in New Orleans, which was composed of free women of color. The order provided nursing care and a home for orphans, later establishing schools as well.  Henriette Delille was born in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1813. Her father Jean-Baptiste Lille Sarpy (var. de Lille) was born about 1758 in Fumel, Lot-et-Garonne, France.[2] Her mother, Marie-Josphe ""Pouponne"" Das, was a free woman of color.  In 1836 Henriette drew up the rules and regulations for devout Christian women, which would eventually become the Society of the Holy Family. The group was foundedfor the purpose of nursing the sick, caring for the poor, and instructing the ignorant.  Venerable Henriette Delille is the first United States native born African American whose cause for canonization has been officially opened by the Catholic Church. What remains for the process to be complete is the validation of an alleged miracle which is now being processed. If all goes well and Pope Benedict XVI issues the decree of the alleged miracle's authenticity, then Henriette will be proclaimed blessed.  Though she gave up a life of wealth for her convictions to God, in her heart, Henriette Delille herself refused to follow the practice of her mother and two siblings and identify as white, and she also defied her mother to work with slaves, nonwhites, and whites among the poor of New Orleans.  This story reflects on the early purpose of Venerable Henriette Delille beginnings beautifully portrayed by Vanessa Williams.",1433808000,3,1592,5.1312741312741315

Too many tropes introduced with surface-level exploration of their inherent ideas. HAHAH. As a filmmaker myself, I can say that this movie was a complete and utter waste of effort. The only reason I give it two stars instead of one is because the costumes were great. This movie has plot lines that don't pan out, but seems to be focused entirely on furthering a christian agenda more than actual storytelling and good cinema. Ugh. Not to mention (and this is going to get a bit personal) I hate it when I see black people spouting Christian idealisms. I can't for the life of me understand why my people have so largely adopted the religion of our oppressors!! The only thing this story did even remotely accurately was demonstrate a small extent of the cruelty of white folks. Otherwise, I got nothing out of this bland portrait of a concept that might have actually stood to be quite compelling. Editing sucked too. Plus, should have casted a hotter faux-Frenchie in the leading male role. But that probably wouldn't have stopped their romance from being robotic and hollow anyways. I hated this aspect of the story immensely. HOW IS THIS MOVIE CALLED ""THE COURAGE TO LOVE"" WHEN NOBODY NOT ONE PERSON EVER HAS THE ""COURAGE TO LOVE."" ????????. This movie is so dumb. Here's a more appropriate title for it: ""Christian Propaganda Thinly-Veiled by Laughable Attempt to Make a Narrative Film."" There. That wasn't so hard, right, writers? You're welcome.

It's really the story of the founding of a religious order based in New Orleans centering largely on the women behind it. The love story here is contrived and superfluous, it's only there to fill screen time while they tell the story of the heroine. This would have made an interesting 30 minute History channel drama. 60 minutes, max. The rest is filler, but I'll give them credit for at least trying to shed some light on a very obscure piece of American and religious history. Most of the acting never rises above two stars. Oddly enough, the best performances are by the background actors, the leads alternate between self-righteousness and camp. A big ho hum.",1397952000,2,783,4.7226277372262775

2154232,5,B0002ZMIV2,"For Lifetime Channel, this is an unusually honest and heartfelt historical drama about a rarely filmed historical setting, namely pre-Civil War New Orleans. It is also unique for depicting the racial tensions of this period through the eyes of a Creole (mixture of African and French parentage) Catholic saint named Henriette Delille. Young Henriette begins this film wrestling with the injustice of placage, a social arrangement whereby Louisiana Frenchmen took Creole women as their concubines, agreeing to support them financially as a sort of ""shadow family"" without challenging existing social taboos by attempting to marry them. Dissatisfied with the ""quadroon balls"" where she is expected to promise herself without marriage to one of these Frenchmen, Henriette finds solace in teaching literacy to the children of slaves in her parish's catechism classes, but her peace is interrupted by the ongoing influx of white Southerners in the wake of U.S. acquisition (Louisiana purchase) of French territory. Attracted to a young French doctor, Henriette is drawn to a choice between being with him (possibly through marriage in France) and dedicating her life to the poor, and the cover of this DVD might cause you to be surprised when you learn what ""the courage to love"" really means in this film.

As this 90-minute production depicts very well, Henriette's ultimate decision is influenced by the pressures of existing social realities, but it's also motivated by her great compassion for the suffering of fellow Creoles in New Orleans. Her spiritual growth in the latter parts of the film is depicted as a gradual and sensitive acceptance of God's will for her life. As a look at early American religious tensions and race relations, this film might be equally ideal for Black History Month and for a religion class. The production quality and acting is generally top drawer. Stacy Keach plays Henriette's father in a way that is simultaneously cowardly and sympathetic, Dianne Carahan plays her mother with affecting psychological distress, and Gil Bellows plays her love interest -- an atheistic doctor -- as someone who generally has the right instincts but lacks the courage to really stand up for his principles. All minor players in the film -- with the possible exception of the main racist antagonist, who comes across as caricatured by a weak actor -- are likewise excellent. Ecclesiastical figures like Henriette's pastor, a mother superior, and Bishop Antoine Blanc of New Orleans (1850-1860) are depicted with sympathy as shrewd supportive figures who are not necessarily willing to put themselves on the line for Henriette, but who do their best to arrange things in her favor because they want her to succeed almost as badly as they want to rebuke American Southern influence on the French culture of New Orleans.

One final note: Vanessa Williams, despite her contemporary sensibilities, brings a warm empathy and likability to the lead role of Henriette that really make the film worthwhile. Although it might have been more historically accurate to hire a classically trained actress who could portray Henriette with greater attention to period values, Williams succeeds in allowing contemporary viewers to connect with this long-dead Catholic saint without sacrificing the historical essence of who she is portraying. She also does a great job of portraying Henriette's inner strength and firm principles, quietly offering a ""girl power"" performance that draws attention to itself only by comparison to the weak and indecisive male characters who surround her in most scenes. Williams gives a nuanced, difficult, and reverential performance that is arguably her best acting work. To be frank, I was initially surprised this film was made for Lifetime, as it is generally free of the hokiest forms of melodrama that one finds in other original productions on that channel. This may well be the only (it is certainly the best) film on Creole Catholicism and placage you will find.",1383609600,25,4002,5.241809672386895

2154236,3,B0002ZMIV2,"Vanessa Williams is a lovely person and an adequate actor - but miss-matched with her would-be love interest in this film.  He did not fit the part, nor did he play it well.  I could not suspend my ""dis-belief"" to become involved with the characters.  It seemed that each scene was filmed without regard for that thread of character development necessary to draw the viewer into the story.  The predicament in which these women found themselves was real, but the script was written without regard for how their situations would have been played out in reality.  The dialogue was far to contemporary; the actions and reactions of the characters seemed like listening into conversations of modern day people, and not at all like conversations that happened at this period in history.  Many years were covered in the film, yet no one seemed to age.  I liked the costumes, the sets (some seemed authentic) and stuck it out to see all of them.

I don't want to criticize the actors, but the costumes were amazing.  The subject matter, criminalizing interracial relationships was difficult to see on film, but all too true a piece of American history.  Still, I was more intrigued by Henriette's allegiance to God and the French doctor's challenge of grappling with the concept of God when he was more invested in science.  Being an interracial couple is one thing, but being unequally yoked is another.  According to Scripture their union would not be proper because of Henriette's faith and the doctor's seemingly disbelief in God, as nice as he was.  Had they both been the same religion they would be ""one in the Spirit"" and that unity could help them overcome prejudices through prayer as opposed to relying strictly on the law to save them.

2154254,1,B0002ZMIV2,"This is one of those movies that extoll the lives of the religious in a totally unrealistic and boring fashion.  Not that I have anything against religiously-inclined people - it's just that the portrayal of them on screen is generally a snore.  One can't help but get the impression from these epics that the individual turned to religion because they lacked a personality and have been totally de-humanized, sanitized and put through a blender.  In real life, I would think the opposite would be true.  I don't think it was yellow fever that killed off the populace, it was catatonia.

The acting is bland, the plot predictable and it strains credulity to ask us to believe that Ms. Williams - pushing 40 at the time, is capable of portraying someone 20-plus years younger.  The scenes of her at the Creole version of a debutante ball are ludicrous. Sorry, but the wrinkles kind of blow the look. And make-up doesn't disguise the fact that Diahann Carroll, who was 65 at the time, is trying to pull the same stunt.  Both ladies have been great singers and actresses in other productions but maybe it's time to pass the baton or at least find something congruent with their age.  Hi-def is a career killer when it comes to close-ups.

Additionally, Vanessa Williams was listed as a producer - it's sort of sad when the only time you can get a part is when you pay for the production.  This would have been much better if Williams had played the mother and mentored any number of younger actresses in the title role.",1297987200,6,1516,4.623134328358209

The free black people of this time also had their own slaves.  These black people were separated by status, but still unequal to whites.

I would never have believed that Vanessa Williams could play a part like this and pull it off, not just well, but with excellence I am certain the storyline took a few historical  liberties, but overall I liked it very much.  I even got emotionally involved in it.  Even free blacks weren't free and even in a city like New Orleans where there were many more than in any other southern city in that era.  I read a lot of comments complaining about it not being a love story, but a story about religion and glorifying religion.  Well, can any of us today imagine what life must have been like for black people in that era - and as this movie shows, what it was like even for those who were free blacks?  Religion exists for several reasons, but one reason is that people who have hopeless, miserable lives need something to help them get by day after day.  Yes, this movie shows the value of religion to these people who were treated so cruelly, and but for their faith, what could sustain them?  I didn't feel it was ""bible thumping preachy"".  I felt it was almost searing in its honesty about why these people in this time needed religion, and it was all they had to cling to..  And the blatant and cruel hatred of blacks, even those who were more white than black and who were free was unpleasant to see, but it was real.  Yeah, as a white person I don't want to be reminded of that - but ""facts are troublesome things"" aren't they?  Maybe this movie should have ben titled the Courage to Live.  This woman's love was for life, and to help others cling to life, and to help them see what little good there was in their life.
