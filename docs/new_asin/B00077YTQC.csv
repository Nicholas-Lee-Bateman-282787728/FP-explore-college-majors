No Longer My Twin is fun and intelligent, and decidedly low budget.  The story line is cohesive.  There is a build-up of suspense, and an interesting twist to the ending.  Robert G Christie overacts his part, but the other players seem to do a nice job with the material they are given to work with.  Sandra Lynn O'Brien plays her part effectively; and, Fran Lane is believable as the haunted woman whom almost everyone else thinks is losing it.  The movie was filmed in Northeast Baltimore, near where I grew up, and so my favorite performance came from Norm Rebadow as the Cemetery Guard, who, in his very limited screen time, nailed the personality to a tee of the unskilled, workaday Baltimorean laborer.  Visual and sound effects are a bit heavy-handed, but commensurate within the genre.  Think ""Troma Films"".

This film is family-friendly once the kiddies get past being afraid of the boogie man; although, if I am ever afflicted with a boogie man, I hope mine looks (and dresses) like Adrianna .  There is no gratuitous sex, nudity, or foul language, and only minimal and mostly implied violence, that is so often a part of these low-budget offerings.  I found that quite refreshing.

All in all, a nice late night, B-minus-movie that is fun to watch!",1472169600,,1391,4.8474576271186445

It is so bad that it is not even funny.  There is absolutely no continuity in this film at all.  The main actress walks out of her house, and it is winter time, 20 seconds later, she is in the forest in the middle of summer, with green leafy trees LOL.  This film ""stars"" failed actor/filmaker Robert G. Christie.  He basically ruins the entire film by his unmatched lack of talent.  I would normally suggest aspiring actors/directors/DPs to watch a poor film like this to ensure they understand the basics DONT'S are...  This film is so bad, that you can't even get a laugh out of it.  Well, in the end the ""Lead"" ""actor"" Robert G. Christie puts on a stellar performance as he runs through a cemetery wearing his old clothes and Velcro sneakers.",1127174400,,918,4.570552147239264
