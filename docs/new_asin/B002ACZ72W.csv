3883959,5,B002ACZ72W,I am just getting back into exercising after many years.  Back in the 90s I watched Gilad and his sister on TV and I remember how well their programs worked for me.  I have started using some of Gildad's workout videos again and I now realize that the reason his excercises work so well is because he is the best I have seen at explaining how to do the exercise and repeating it over and over until even non-coordinated dopes like me get it.  I get better results with his workouts that anyone else's.  I think his work is underappreciated and I feel this video merits 5 stars.,1290297600,12,577,4.314814814814815
3883960,4,B002ACZ72W,"I have many of Gilad's workouts, and I find that they are the ones I go to the most when I want to hit all areas + get a good aerobic workout. This one is no exception and I'm glad to have a more recent version but it is basically 2 of the new TV shows - no problem with that except that the ""commercial breaks"" are still there. There isn't an actual break of course but he leaves you with orders to do more reps during the break so you shortchange yourself as the video keeps going. You either have to pause it to get all of your reps in, or you miss out on completing all of the exercises.",1288828800,25,591,3.8925619834710745
3883961,5,B002ACZ72W,"I think this is a bit easier than the Peak Performance with Gilad workouts. To repeat what I feel is important in my review of Gilad Peak Performance, I don't think Gilad knows this, but those people who used to be athletically active in younger years but now find themselves stamina-limited in older years, have a good solution to fitness with Gilad exercise routines. He motivates me but not over-motivates me.",1265760000,18,412,4.816901408450704
3883962,5,B002ACZ72W,"This is a new series of  three videos put out by Gilad. I bought them for my wife, who was looking for new routines to do. She started back in the 80's when it was more ""High impact"" and over time she has endured foot problems due to the pounding. Then more awareness of how high impact can do more harm in the late 90's came out the exercise industry had to change. Well, she still craves that high energy work out, but hard to find in a video without the high impact activity. So these videos of Gilad's do the trick for her, for they blend strong body movements with weights helps her get that feeling of, ""I feel like I have exercised"" feeling again. Gilad keeps her motivated and on target.",1264204800,36,695,4.225563909774436

3883964,5,B002ACZ72W,Gilad truly gives you a total body workout and can be modified to whatever level you want. Own many other DVDs of his.,1428883200,,118,4.173913043478261

3883966,5,B002ACZ72W,"Good without with full body workout. A bit of cardio mixed with a little weight lifting. Good for maintenance.the breaks where commercials were for its tv viewing c commercials are a bit awkward. Overall, I'm glad I purchased.",1392940800,,226,4.973684210526316
3883967,5,B002ACZ72W,"I bought all three of Gilads new workout ""total body sculpt"" dvd's.  I've been working out with Gilad for many years off and on.  These are all easy to follow and you can do them at your own fitness level from beginner to seasoned.  I like that I control which workouts I will do by selecting warm-up, cardio, weights, abs or cooldown depending on how much time I have. I'm looking forward to his next set of videos.",1384300800,,416,4.3076923076923075
3883968,5,B002ACZ72W,"After this workout, my rear end is SORE.
I have been working out all my life and this targets my rear end so well.
Gilad and his crew are great to work out with because they demonstrate perfect form.
My knees and back are never sore with Gilad's workouts as they are with so many other DVDs I have tried.
I have all three of the Total Body Sculpt series (Functional Fitness, Cutting Edge and Peak Performance) and they are all THE BEST.  Challenging and effective and easy on the joints!",1382227200,,487,4.351648351648351
3883969,5,B002ACZ72W,"I have a few different personal home video's but nothing ever tops Gilad.  I used to watch his show on the fitness network, and totally love that you only need minimal weight if any at all to feel the effects.  I recommend any and all of his work outs.",1372982400,,252,4.122448979591836
3883970,4,B002ACZ72W,45 minutes goes by soooo fast with this video. I have 45/45 split video already and have used that for years (I won't say how many).Love Gilad!,1367625600,2,143,4.333333333333333
3883971,5,B002ACZ72W,"Workout fads come and go, but Gilad is a classic, and the classics never go out of style. These are my go-to workout videos because they're fun, challenging, and most of all, effective.",1363564800,,185,4.636363636363637
3883972,5,B002ACZ72W,"If you are ready to change your muscles and burn a lot of fat, buy this DVD. It is wonderful and you'll have fun while you're at it.",1359763200,,132,3.75
3883973,3,B002ACZ72W,"My wife has been using these DVDs on occasion to work out when she can't get to her regular classes.  She feels these disks are OK, but not really intense enough for her liking.  She uses these DVDs to provide an example, and then she improvises.",1358294400,,246,4.326086956521739
3883974,4,B002ACZ72W,"I bought a set of 3 Gilad DVDs in the Total Body Sculpt Plus series.  They are great workouts.  The only complaint I have is that between sets, the previous set is not complete.  It appears these were recorded from the FitTV series and the end of each segment (except for the last one) is missing the full workout.  Unless you pause the DVD to finish, you are missing perhaps a minute or two of the each workout.",1348099200,,412,4.243589743589744
3883975,4,B002ACZ72W,"For over a year now I've been doing this workout in rotation with the other two recommended as a set. My only complaint is that it (and the other two) allow for non-existent commercial breaks, but I manage to keep up with the resulting increased pace.

The first show's primary feature focuses on squats and lunges. For those of us with knee issues, this can be a problem. Combined with my toe surgery I have trouble utilizing the full depth of the moves. On the plus side, I'm still seeing improvements in my muscle tone, and gradually challenge myself to reach deeper as long as I don't cause undue stress on the joints. The only thing I wish Gilad had done differently is to make each sculpt segment completely different in how the lower body is worked.

The second show features routines with and without weights, partly to help warm up the muscles. I love it! He stresses which muscle groups are being focused, yet coaches to hold in the abs, how to breathe, how far to turn, and exactly where your knee should align with your heel to avoid injury. This is a high-paced workout. It includes a cardio segment, which in my opinion isn't needed as such, but it certainly provides a break from weights!

Even after all this time, each use of the dvd programs challenges me. I'm free to mix it up, shortening the session if need by by eliminating a segment. Rather than 2 workouts I create 4, and even those can be changed.",1336867200,,1423,4.486486486486487
3883976,5,B002ACZ72W,Gilad is awesome. He gets you off the couch and moving. If you want a total body work out this one will do it. I love it.,1332028800,,121,3.5185185185185186
3883977,4,B002ACZ72W,"The Gilad exercise tape is just what I expected it to be.  It has 2 different shows so you have a choice of what exerices you want to do.  I received it in a timely manner and it was in good condition. It would have been nice to know a bit more about the DVD before I purchased it, like exactly what exerices were on it but I am not disappointed.",1328400000,2,346,3.859154929577465
3883978,4,B002ACZ72W,"I had recorded workouts with Gilad before I purchased this DVD.  The 45 min workouts did not disappoint me.  The DVD is made up of different parts of his shows only without commercials.  When he says he'll be back after the break and to keep doing a certain exercise, I just pause it to finish the exercise. When I get tired of doing these two workouts, I will probably order more.",1328227200,2,381,4.338028169014085
3883979,5,B002ACZ72W,"I discovered Gilad's television program on Comcast On Demand and have been a fan for years.  I worked out to Gilad when I couldn't make it to the gym and now that I have a home gym, I have three of his DVDs that I alternate - which promises a great workout every time.

I'm a professional blogger who sits at a computer all day writing. I need a convenient work out that I can do in less than an hour that will keep me fit and trim.  With Gilad, I can work out every other day, 3 days a week, whatever my schedule will allow.  I can even take him on the road with me.

Gilad's work outs are a great diversion, relieving stress, keeping me healthy and fit, and leaving my body sore the next day and proving that he lead me in a great work out.

3883980,5,B002ACZ72W,"Gilad's Total Body Sculpt workouts help you tone, shape and work your muscles. Each workout is balanced with a warm up, body sculpting segment, abs, and a stretch. The Total Body Sculpt PLUS videos are even more intense and include an extra sculpting segment PLUS a kickboxing cardio segment that will let you know you've had a serious workout. Excellent for anyone who wants to challenge their body and get in shape.",1315699200,,417,4.805555555555555
3883981,5,B002ACZ72W,"I liked getting two 45 minute workouts on one DVD.  Both workouts are effective and worth the time.  These aren't extreme workouts that make you hurt, but they do sculpt your body.  Alternating Gilad with Jillian Michaels has worked very well for me.",1306281600,,250,4.767441860465116
3883982,2,B002ACZ72W,"Years ago I did the exercises every day and loved it.

I walk and ride my bike daily, for about 5,6 miles, but there are muscles which are out of shape. So I wanted workouts aimed at advanced beginners.

I purchased this DVD, but was disappointed. It looks like it was copied from a poor quality video tape. Multiple times it turned almost black and that lasted for minutes. It looks cheap and unprofessional.
And there are breaks as if there are commercials, but what are they doing on a DVD? Sometimes you don't have the time to continue the exercise through the 'commercial break'.

I don't care for the music either, while I loved the music years ago.
The music on this DVD doesn't help me to enjoy the exercises and sometimes the exercises don't quite follow the rhythm of the beat.

The first workout is not my style. The exercise that focuses on a sort of boxing choreography is to complicated, it's not suited for beginners, I think.

The second workout is more what I hoped to see, but all in all I wouldn't have ordered this DVD.
I would now order a DVD from the earlier seasons, but first I would want to make sure the quality isn't as poor as this one.",1303948800,5,1164,4.37037037037037
