8508776,2,B0072A12E4,I like sci-fi so the premise of being on the ISS and losing contact with Earth intrigued me.  I wish I could say it was 87 minutes well spent but it was quite the opposite. The movie started out good but quickly became mundane and boring resulting in a struggle just to stay awake.  Several times I found myself nodding off but thanks to sheer will power managed to watch it to the end.  Sadly I can't recommend it.,1481500800,,415,4.227848101265823
