7903565,3,6302782732,"This had to be one of LDP 1st films. It was filmed in Frisco, TX (population aboout 1,500 at the time) in about 1985. I was asked to appear in the film as one of the members of the band - but my family was going on vacation at the time. I later saw the film with my youth group and met the cast. I remember thinking that it was a fun movie with Christian morals. It was also fun to see my friends and home town on film. Would be fun to own for memory sake.",1267401600,,456,3.711340206185567
7903566,5,6302782732,I really loved this movie. We all have had hard times growing up and it's good to hear a positive end to things. In today's age it's hard to find clean Christian movies that teach family values. Movies that teach character and values are very important. In a bad society we can at the very least keep what we watch clean and healthy. Hope this becomes available on dvd soon.,1241481600,,374,4.357142857142857
