7949620,5,B00005Q3VG,I have rarely seen better.  They went traditional yet with magic creating a perfect blend here.  ALL OUT DVD sells the series now for $50.00 region free for those of us that need it.  Excellent job done here and it can not get much better.  They also have the new series airing in Britian OCT 2006.,1162080000,4,298,4.267857142857143
7949621,5,B00005Q3VG,"Please, please let this series be on DVD someday soon.  This series was the most exquisitely crafted work of art...it would be a tragedy if it were never to be released on DVD.  This series was magnificent...beautiful & talented actors, historically impressive, a VERY REAL, raw and inspirational experience.  The performances given by Michael Praed were so powerful...no one will ever be a better Robin Hood (not even Jason Connery in the later episodes!)  As another viewer mentioned, I also grew up watching this series.  It is in my top 5 all-time favorites!  My tapes are worn-out as well...I would also seriously buy every single episode if it were ever realeased on DVD, regardless of price.",1142726400,8,698,4.974137931034483
