723230,5,6303917194,"Love it!  I am a busy wife and mother of 2.  I can fit the 15 minute routine into my schedule.  If time allows, I can do more than one segment.  I have given several copies as gifts.",975196800,,182,3.710526315789474
723231,5,6303917194,"Donna Richardson is the best part of this tape--she's down-to- Earth, motivating, and her cueing is impeccable. You always know when a change is coming because she tells you!  There are 4 15-minute segments: Upper Body, Hips & Thighs, Buns, and Abs. She gives some of the segments cute names like, ""This is Abs with Attitude.""  She has two friends with her who keep the ambience fun.  Each section is self-contained, with its own warm-up and cool-down.  You could do each section on a different day, or combine them in whichever ways work for you, or do them all in one day.  The exercises are effective and some are quite unique.  I think the tape would be suitable for beginners, intermediates, and advanced, by using heavier weights, adding ankle weights, and/or doing more sets of the exercises. She covers all major muscle groups. This tape is wonderful for someone who is extremely busy, like myself, but who wants to keep in shape.  One of my favorites!",973814400,14,960,4.746987951807229
723232,5,6303917194,"This is a great workout for all levels.  Beginners can start with no weights, intermediates can go for small weights and as you progress you can add ankle weights and heavier dumbells.  You can break the video up into 1  segment a day or do any combination.  Its great because each segment has  it's own warm-up and cool down.  I recommend this video because she is a  great instructor and very motivating.",947894400,16,406,4.555555555555555
723233,4,6303917194,"Finally a workout I can do in the morning, even after I sleep in. 15 minutes a day and you rotate your workouts so it's not boring. I recommend it for the easily bored, and/or over scheduled excerciser.",939168000,,202,4.342105263157895

I was very pleased, impressed and quite satisfied, because the seller handled my order with such promptness and on December 23, 2006 I received my tape.

723315,4,6303917194,This was a pretty effective exercise video.  The routines on this video are realistic to follow.,1135123200,,96,5.0
723316,4,6303917194,"I agree with the reviewer who wished to edit out the comments of the workout partners.  Donna is upbeat enough -- she doesn't need two annoying personalities cheering behind her (I swear, sometimes Donna seems annoyed too, but maybe I'm projecting).
Nevertheless, these 4 workouts are very efficient, and each has its own warm up and cool down fit into the 15 minutes.  I recently got a lot of new tapes for variety, and I now appreciate Donna's workouts even more.",1083542400,5,465,4.728395061728395
723317,5,6303917194,"definitely a keeper.  My VCR ate my first video and I'm just shopping for the same one new!  This is a great workout.  And in only 15 minutes a day, you'll see results in a couple of weeks!!",1051488000,7,190,3.9473684210526314

This is an excellent toning video.  Donna provides very specific, comprehensive workout routines that quickly and effectively tone all the problem areas of the body--arms, abs, buttocks, and thighs.  The exercises are intermediate level, including warm-ups and cool down exercises all in a flexible format that allows you to focus on any part of the body you choose in a variety of different ways.  I use this video everyday and alternate it with either one of Donna's ""30 Days to Firmer Arms and Abs"" or ""30 Days to Firmer Thighs"".  That way I get a complete workout everyday along with the fat burning exercises offered in the 30-day videos.  If you use these, you will lose weight quickly and safely.",1046390400,,718,4.852459016393443
723319,4,6303917194,"This vdieo consists of four separate 15-minute workouts--arms/shoulders, hips/thighs, buttocks, and abs--each with its own brief warm-up and cool-down.  The upper body section contains traditional exercises for each of the major muscle groups, while the hips & thighs section adds some unique twists to the usual squats and lunges.  The buttocks program is tough, and I especially liked the abs section, which again contains unique variations of traditional moves.  Donna is an enthusiastic instructor who sometimes goes a little over-the-top, but mostly, she acts as a motivating workout buddy.  She has two background exercisers, and it's nice to see that they have varied body types.  This video would be very appropriate for beginners using light weights or more experienced exercisers using heavier weights; it's perfect for virtually anyone looking to incorporate short strength workouts into their fitness schedule.",1016582400,8,922,5.6521739130434785
723320,5,6303917194,"Say what you want but Donna Richardson is a great motivator, great instructor and the exercises work!  This four day rotation isall a person needs when they are looking to supplement their fitness routine or are looking for a quick workout on those busy (or lazy) days.
There are four sections(abs, buns, arms and thighs) each section has its own warm-up and cool down and traditional exercise routines that will effectively tone each body part.
Donna is full of energy always encouraging anmd motivating you and she has such a down to earth feel that the exercises are not even a chore.
This is an excellent video to add to your library and is worth every penny.",1012348800,8,663,4.666666666666667
723321,5,6303917194,"This is a very effective workout video by my favorite instructor.  I have all of her videos (except Step & Awesome Abs, because I don't have a step.)  There are 4 segments, each around 15 minutes in length.  They all have their own warm-up, stretch & cool-down.  Her video Donna-Mite came out at the same time as this, & would be a good choice to do before this one.
The 1st part is arms.  This segment is all standing, although you go into a lunge position for a few moves.
Part 2 is the thigh workout (the best segment, in my opinion.)  It's divided into standing squat & lunge moves, then moves on to floorwork, which consists of inner & outer-thigh raises.
Next comes probably the most challenging part of the video, butt & hamstrings.  Just like the thigh segment, it starts off with standing moves.  You'll need balance for these, so a chair would be helpful if needed.  Then, just like the thigh segment, it moves on to floorwork, but instead of laying on your side, you're on your hands & knees toning your butt & hamstrings.  It can get tiring, because I have long legs, so it's hard to keep it going, but of course it's okay to rest.
Finally, abs & waist.  It's a great segment, & feels good to lie down after all that standing & balancing in the previous 2 segments.  She mixes traditional moves with some new variations making for a complete mid-section workout.
Donna is a master at cuing, but since this is a slower-paced toning video her skills at that aren't quite as noticeable.  4-Day Rotation is a must have to tone your body, & don't forget to check-out her funky aerobics videos too!",992390400,28,1604,4.4520547945205475
