7621576,5,B01B4LJ392,"It's a cute movie which will have more meaning for those with an affinity for the UK and especially for those who lived through the war.  My parents are British and were kids during the war so they really enjoyed it.  It is also based on a long running British sitcom, so it would have more meaning for those who were familiar with the sitcom as well.",1483401600,6,351,4.223880597014926
7621577,3,B01B4LJ392,"Typical British mid level humor. Well preformed,

7621578,4,B01B4LJ392,"If like me you loved the original tv series then the movie is worth watching at least once. Of course it isn't the same as the show. How could it be? The original cast could never be replaced and they worked together so well it seems like they were born to play their roles. The cast of this movie however do a fitting tribute. Toby Jones' voice sounds remarkably like Arthur Lowe, and you do see two familiar faces from the original cast. Ian Lavender (Private Pike) makes a cameo, as does the original vicar Frank Williams who is once again playing the Reverend Timothy Farthing. Also most viewers will see a few folks they might recognize such as Catherine Zeta-Jones, Michael Gambon, and Mark Gatiss.

If you've never watched the original Dad's Army then I doubt you will enjoy this movie very much. But if you are already familiar with the characters then I think at the very least you will get a smile on your face and watch to rewatch the old episodes again. The ending scene on the beach shows that even though the characters are meant to be laughed at, in the end they were all very brave people who would give their lives to protect the England that they all love. Give this movie a try if you love classic British comedy, and don't panic, don't panic!",1483228800,2,1262,4.439655172413793

7621583,2,B01B4LJ392,Pathetically bad and with no entertainment value. It is really very bad and an insult to the original TV series. Almost none of the characters are believable and often almost unrecognizable from the originals.  Whoever thought to make this absurd movie really should have done their homework first and insisted that the modern actors tried to assume the parts with some degree of veracity. But really its an impossible task and the real failure of the director is not to realize that the original TV series was just those characters; the stories are just an incidental. What this Zeta woman is doing is quite beyond me.,1481328000,6,619,4.839622641509434
7621584,4,B01B4LJ392,"Having never seen the original TV series or films I went into this modern adaptation a complete newbie. Charming, witty and classical are just a few words i could use to describe this film, very reminiscent of other shows available on the UK TV Gold channel or whatever its called now days, i have now been convinced to go back and watch the originals. I mean if i really enjoyed this and its a remake/spin off then the original should hopefully be amazing.
With a strong and loveable cast, including a handful of recognisable and iconic British actors this was always set for greatness. Although a couple of the scenes were overly far-fetched and unbelievable this still adds to the charm of the retro scripting and over all deliverance of the film.
I also fear this film may never be as successful as it should be seeing as i rarely saw it advertised before its release and it may unfortunately be overshadowed by bigger block buster films such Deadpool and Zoolander which were both heavily marketed. I hope that im wrong as this should have a place in every true British citizens heart and proves that classic approaches can still provide substance. (If it aint broke don't fix it). Very well done to everyone involved.",1469145600,8,1223,4.693023255813953
7621585,4,B01B4LJ392,"In the spring of 1944 a group of guardsmen protect the town of ""Walington on the Sea."" They take on aspects of the ""Keystone Cops"" as they fumble through their drills, lead by George (Toby Jones) ""a man with vision"" when he is wearing his glasses. When the refined Rose Wilson (Catherine Zeta-Jones) shows up as a journalist doing a story, the men fall all over themselves as the woman folk of the town work to protect their claim. Rose is a spy for the Germans, something two elderly women figure out early in the film.

I liked the film because it reminded me of my own father who served in WWII, not in the front lines, but guarding the coast of North Carolina...but that didn't deter him from telling ""war"" stories. Today his tall tales would brand him as a liar and a disgrace to everyone who served, etc. But I still loved them. Bill Nighy did his type cast job as a former Oxford professor.

The film had its humorous moments as the women come to the rescue.

Granted, if you're going to compare it to the original, you will be disappointed, and yes, the on screen presence of Elizabeth is somewhat disappointed as it ruins the mystery of the original series.
  However, if you view it for what it is, a new movie for a new generation, which does a good job of paying homage to the original then I think, like me, you will enjoy it. This is how most ""reboots"" are intended to be watched after all",1496448000,3,529,4.333333333333333

Remakes are doomed from the start but that's not what makes this movie such a failure to me. Ignoring the fact that major characters were already given their identities by actors who spent 9 years playing these roles, Dad's Army just does not work as a feature film. It is like trying to make Faulty Towers into a feature length film. It sounds like a pretty cool idea but it doesn't work. It takes too long to set up the comic bits in the context of the story, and far longer than what fans of these shows are used to. In a 27 minute episode, the humor is vibrant and quick. One joke follows another and then another. Proving this is not just a case of me being prejudice against all remakes with different actors is my feeling that the original feature film attempt at ""Dad's Army"" (released in 1971 with all of the original cast) suffers from the same problem I have with this. Rent it if you must but you'd probably be better off enjoying the original TV series and ignoring the attempts to bring the characters to life in a feature length film.",1524960000,,1180,4.368181818181818

Thought all the actors did a great job, and this cast was stellar!  And I have to say, it is nice to see Catherine Zeta-Jones back in a starring role.
But the writing and plot of this movie was mediocre...

Was hoping by the end of it, I would be cheering on the couch as this misfit band saved the day, but was really just ready to hit the loo and put my popcorn bowl away...",1519430400,,499,4.123711340206185
