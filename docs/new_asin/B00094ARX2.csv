2265825,5,B00094ARX2,"Within Yu's invigorating movie we take an extremely intense and magical trip into the litte-known art of Henry Darger. In The Realms of The Unreal introduces us to the brooding and often horrific mind of Henry Darger which is brought to life by amazing voice actors such as Dakota Fanning and Larry Pine.

 Yu's treatment of Henry's art is just as sensitive (and engrossing) as her treatment of his art. The surreal dream-like landscapes that Henry Darger created in his huge novel are animated perfectly by Yu. Birds streak across technicolor skies while the children of Albeannia fight the evil Glandelinians in startling motion.

Never before has Darger's life and art been so sensitively told, and I highly suggest this movie to anyone interested in art of any kind.  Darger's work is now imitated by thousands of artists across the world and his subversive and disturbing imagery is entirely unqiue and very exciting to see. Not only does Yu truly do justice to this art (she shows at least half of Darger's work) but she uses it to tell the heartbreaking story of a man who only wanted a person to love.

Yu has created a truly great movie and it is, most definitely, a must buy.",1116720000,9,1185,4.705314009661835
2265826,4,B00094ARX2,"The film introduces the outsider artist/writer whose madness and talent have been studied in psychology, visual art, and other fields. The film, I think, has a limitation of dealing with this complex, peculiar, and unique individual, but I certainly think the film did a good job in introducing Henry and his work.

The film was not enough for me to conclude as to whether he was mad or not. Yes, he was talking to lots of ""beings"" in his apartment when he was actually alone, but he seems to have bothered no one while he lived, and I wonder if he was not completely clinically ill. Like I said, the film did not provide me with enough information to decide if he was mad. Considering he was able to hold a job though he was poor, I feel like assuming his was a borderline case. I think his being religious had helped him staying within functional human life, let alone the act of painting and story writing helping him to live. I somehow feel that he was aware of his delusion being unreal but couldn't help living in the fantasy because he loved his realms he was able to create.

This film casts an open-ended question - what does living own life mean? We may have what Henry didn't have, but how can we say that we live happier than Henry did?",1113350400,2,1248,4.375

2265868,5,B00094ARX2,I have watched this video 10 times and it is still fascinating.  Henry Darger's work is very complex and deserves the artistic recognition.  He should actually be a part of MoMA and not the Folk Art Museum.  As a painter I find his work brilliant.  Artistically I never tire of his compositions and subject matter.  This DVD was done so extremely well and the woman who did this film deserves ENORMOUS applause.  Watch all the interviews and extras on the DVD.,1401926400,,460,4.617283950617284

2265870,1,B00094ARX2,"So many have profited from someone who had absolutely no awareness of any of this. He never had the opportunity to witness any of his ""art"" going public it was taken by his landlords of all people to do with what they wish without any real consent from Henry Darger, or awareness. He never got anything out of this industry that crept up in his name. Thoroughly, thoughtlessly and shamelessly exploited by people who really have limited feeling and no clue.  A real disgrace to humanity that people  would do this to someone who has suffered so much hardship and pain in life.
I give Henry Darger infinite stars being able to free himself as much as he could and the courage to do what he could with his difficult circumstances. As for the landlords and everyone else who shamelessly profited off his sufferings, I would give ZERO stars if I could.
It both outrages and disgusts me to know people are so interested in only their own profit at the expense of anything else that they would put someone's personal belongings and put them on such public display without the knowledge of the person who created them.

VULTURES!

And you can bet the ones who are profiting off all this haven't got the guts or desire to put all their personal junk on the table for all to see, every little detail for the entire world to consider, mull over and judge.  Would you like every aspect of your life exposed without your knowledge or consent and not get anything out of the deal? Think about that.

2265874,1,B00094ARX2,"This ""documentary"" is a blatant attempt to contribute to and fester the 'myth' of Henry Darger, a reclusive, backward man who concocted a trite and repetitive story (18,000 pages) filled with extreme inconsistencies (his ""Christian"" army is involved in bloody warfare - tenets of Christ were those of a pacifist, etc) and sadomasochistic tendencies. It seems he lived in his own sullied world, formed mostly by an extreme fascination with children and the sufferings of Christ (he had upon his wall 13,000 representations of crucifixes). His landlords found his room after he died, stuffed with inumerable articles of junk, stacks of wet papers, hairballs, empty bottles and yet, being artists and entrepreneurs themselves, they hatched a theme to create Henry Darger as a genius of 'outsider art', their attempts succeeded, Darger's immature works, mostly traced drawings, slapped on with some vivid color schemata, in every sense lacking any cohesive aesthetic, have sold for millions now.

The room itself was photographed, cataloged and inducted into the 'folk art' hall of fame. Darger was seemingly a lunatic, at odds with his warped Christian conditioning and society itself, he would hide in his room for hours on end, lusting after children and cut out articles and trace faces onto pieces of toilet paper (he was poor). There's no doubt that he holds some fascination for us, mainly because of his weirdness but eventually even that is usurped by the painstaking tediousness and forcefulness of accepting such unworthy levels of art into our consciousness, as this documentary begs us to do.

Since he is dead, he can not speak for himself, and thus, his 'myth' is assurred, bringing the curious to worship at his feet and sell his works for staggering prices.",1386201600,,1770,5.142361111111111

His landlords were money grubbing exploiters of his legacy, selling 1/3, keeping a 1/3 and giving only a third to the American Folk art museum.

I only wanted to share something with the movie's fans. I think you should definitely read a book by Wilhelm Reich, ""The Murder of Christ"". It's not a book about religion as such. It's not a book about Jesus Christ himself. You don't have to be neither a believer nor a non-believer, to appreciate its content. In fact, the murder of Christ, the way Reich means it, is the historically systematic murder of the purity and innocence of little children. If you dearly love children and feel like they should be protected from contemporary madness at all costs, read it. It is as much of a poignant book as Darger's art was. It seems to me like the Vivian Girls are beautiful Reichian creatures. One day people will look back and realize how people like Reich and Darger had already understood, during the 20th century, what many, many, many children are facing on a daily basis.",1293408000,,1036,4.51595744680851

2265914,4,B00094ARX2,"In the Realms of the Unreal (Jessica Yu, 2004)

Rising star Jessica Yu has been making a name for herself in the television world, directing episodes of such shows as The West Wing and Grey's Anatomy. She does enter the feature-film world every once in a while, though, and for that we should all be thankful. Here she didn't really need to do too much; when you've got a subject so intrinsically fascinating as the late janitor/artist Henry Darger, all you have to do is not screw up. That said, the difference between a director who simply doesn't screw up and an accomplished documentary filmmaker is ineffable, at least to me, but I know it when I see it; Frederick Wiseman and Errol Morris (usually) can make anything interesting. I mean, come on, you have to be a genius to make a documentary called Public Housing and have it be gripping. Yu has a far more interesting subject, which makes it tougher to tell whether she's got the goods. I understand some of the controversy surrounding the film, but after watching it, I firmly believe she does. She could make a documentary about the most boring public figure in America (I'll leave you to fill in that blank yourself) and it'd be awesome.

Henry Darger is not that person. His story is interesting enough on its own--a lifelong janitor who labored on a piece of art spanning many thousands of pages in secret--but when you combine it with that piece of art, wow. It's obvious that an artist's particular neuroses are encapsulated, and often emphasized, in that artist's work, and Darger was a guy with a whole lot of neuroses. He poured them out into an alternate universe that's not like anything you've ever seen before.

And that, in most cases, seems to be the problem. The world Darger created, according to many critics of both the man and the documentary, shows unequivocally that Darger was a pedophile and a rapist. (Much of the controversy surrounding the documentary, ironically, seems to stem from Yu's adoption of the more conventional viewpoint that Darger was slow--possibly autistic--and that his views on young women were innocent, childlike.) To me, the controversy itself is more than enough reason to check this out, so you have at least some sort of base to form your own opinion. (It should go without saying given the reaction to the film that Yu does not downplay the controversial bits. As always, they're the most fascinating.) But the way in which the documentary is made is fascinating as well. There are a lot of people who don't like it, because some of the conventions Yu uses are things you see in, for example, historic center videos. I think those people are missing the vast difference in artistry here; this is what would happen if you contracted a top-level B-list director to make your historic center video.

I loved this. I may be in the minority on that, but I highly recommend it for anyone with even a casual interest in Darger, and even those who have never heard of the guy before. His story is either inspirational or horrifying, depending on your interpretation, and that alone is interesting enough to make him worth your while. Pick it up. ****",1248739200,,3153,4.7272727272727275
2265915,4,B00094ARX2,"IN THE REALMS OF THE UNREAL is a 2004 documentary film by Jessica Yu introducing the life and work of Henry Darger. A major figure of ""outsider art"", Darger's work was only discovered after his death when his landlords found thousands of pages of text and paintings in his room. Through his long life, he was known to his few friends and associates only as a janitor in a local hospital. Secretly, he wrote a massive manuscript chronicling the rebellion of girl slaves in a fantasy world, painted with watercolors of the heroines and battles.

Yu has chosen three main narrators for the documentary. A little girl (Dakota Fanning, even) narrates Darger's biographical facts, while excerpts from Darger's autobiography are reads by an old man (Larry Pine), and texts from his fantasy epic are read by some fellow with a radio play delivery. In addition, we find interviews with people who knew Darger. Kiyoko Lerner, his landlady and now the caretaker of his legacy, is of course featured, as are some of his neighbours and an altar boy from his church. While everyone reports him to be an odd fellow, Yu avoids the controversial issue of Darger's mental health, preserving the ambiguity of whether he was mad or a mere eccentric. Similarly, the relation of Darger's work to sexual frustrations or the possibility of sexual abuse as a child are left out. But this is a mere introduction, and it's reasonable to expect the viewer to move on to other sources for contentious matters. My only real complaint is that Yu is not always content to let Darger's paintings speak for themselves. Rather, she has animated certain of Darger's scenes, which I feel distorts the paintings to a degree. While I think the film does not deserve a one-star rating for this as another reviewer awarded it, it is troubling.

Nonetheless, all in all this is a fine presentation of a remarkable figure. And if Darger's intrigues you, I'd recommend also discovering Adolf Wolfli, a Swiss madman whose life and work resembles Darger in several years.",1241222400,,2025,4.8497109826589595
2265916,5,B00094ARX2,"This video is a must for any admirer of Henry Darger's artwork. The combination of interviews with those who knew Darger, the narration by actress Dakota Fanning as the Vivian girls and the animations of Darger's drawings/collages provided insight into Henry Darger's mind and creative motivations.
Most videos about artists bore me because they are too reverent and put the artist on a pedestal unattainable by us mere mortals. Almost invariably some art historian or curator will attempt a too facile linear connection between the artist's inner creative life and the outward events/experiences of that life.
This is one of the best films about an artist I've ever seen. Jessuca Yu is compassionate about her subject without pitying him.",1234915200,,739,5.218487394957983

2265939,5,B00094ARX2,"I'm not going to get as serious as some with my review.  I think this film is very well done and artistic in it's own right.  However, sometimes I felt like the filmmaker was taking liberties that should not have been taken.  At points the narration and animation of Darger's work takes away from the art itself.  It is also hard to form an opinion on Darger's work/life/situation when so much of the filmmaking is done to the filmmakers belief.
It is difficult to say this film is anything less than 5 stars, though, because of its beauty and the amount of information it contains.  It is worth seeing and owning due to its importance in the mystery of Darger.  See this, enjoy it and learn more about the Realms of the Unreal.",1213574400,,728,4.43609022556391
2265940,4,B00094ARX2,"Maybe I should confess first that I didn't know the name of Henry Darger before watching this documentary. They say there are many artists inspired by his extraordinary works - a manuscript with more than 15,000 pages, for instance - but sorry, I didn't know his seven ""Vivian Girls"" fighting the evil, or the illustrations he created for the fantasy story.

But the story of Henry Darger himself is intriguing enough, partly because it is, or seems, so uneventful except his early days. He had lived in a small apartment room in Chicago for 40 years before he died in 1973 and very few people knew him - they are not still sure how to pronounce his surname - and no one knew what he was doing in his room until the landlords stepped in after his death to find the manuscript and hundreds of drawings. The life of Henry Darger himself is a mystery. Not a mystery of which answer everyone wants to know, yes, I know, but still interesting for me as a portrait of a lonely man. Or was he?

Unfortunately, the documentary directed by Jessica Yu doesn't answer the question as to what kind of person Henry Darger was. The people around him are interviewed, but what they reveal is not particularly amazing or illuminating. It was a long time ago after all and any details of episodes, if any, have been irrevocably lost (there are only three known photos of Henry Darger).

Probably this is why the director decided to use an unconventional method to introduce the world of the elusive artist's imagination. Henry Darger's pictures are made into Terry Gilliam-style animation with the voice of Dakota Fanning. While some would say it is a brilliant way to introduce the creativity of the artist, or even the personalities of him, others may disagree saying we should not meddle with the artist's works and life which should be left alone.

I liked the animation part, but if you ask me if ""In the Realms of the Unreal"" is a success as an attempt on directors' side to re-evaluate the unique works reclusive Henry Darger left behind, I am not sure. Is he a modern-day William Blake? Frankly I don't know. Like any outsider artists it is hard to judge and it takes more time for us to know.",1211500800,,2184,4.563775510204081
2265941,5,B00094ARX2,"I realized while watching this film that I first heard of Henry Darger only a few blocks from where he lived and worshipped.  I had taken my daughter to guitar lessons at the former location of the Old Town School of Folk Music, about three blocks south from the address listed as Darger's address on the letter in the film he wrote expressing sorrow over his friend's death.  The church at which he worshipped is only a few blocks west of that address.  I write this only a few blocks from St. Joseph's Hospital, where Darger worked as a janitor for many years.  All of this brings his story home to me in a particularly poignant way.  My neighborhood was also his.

Darger is, of course, one of the best known and most celebrated outsider artists, the author of a staggeringly large illustrated novel IN THE REALMS OF THE UNREAL, about a war between Christian and anti-Christian forces in a make believe land.  The most compelling part of Darger's story is that he was completely untrained as an artist and writer and that except for a single friend was a lifelong recluse.  His neighbors and the few who knew him elsewhere had no idea that he was the author of a 15,000 page illustrated novel.

The filmmaker made several interesting decisions in making the documentary, all of which I think were done successfully.  No critics or experts or outside commentators were employed.  All interviews were with people who knew Darger, including the landlady who helped preserve Darger's room after realizing what he had achieved there.  There are actors who portray Darger and who read passages from Darger's work, but no art critics.  The narration is by the then very young Dakota Fanning, appropriate given Darger's fascination with young girls.  More controversially, the director decided to animate many of his images, of which more below.

Anyone viewing this film will get a good sense of what Darger's work is about.  There are sadly no books in print summarizing his work or giving good examples of it.  The books that have been produced are all out of print.  By any measure Darger's story is an amazing one and it deserves to be even more widely known than it is.  The film also brings out both Darger's virtues as an artist and his quirks.  One of the best examples of the latter is that he may not have had a very good understanding of female anatomy, always drawing nude female figures (as an expression of innocence) with decidedly male genitalia.

Finally, to the reviewers who are outraged that the filmmaker manipulated Darger's paintings to create animated images I can only ask:  precisely what is the problem?  One reviewer says that this manipulation violates a sacred rule.  Where, precisely is that rule articulated?  And what could possibly make it sacrosanct?  I actually think that the animation of his paintings made them more visually interesting for the medium in which they were being presented.  Would I want this in a book of his work?  Of course not.  But whatever imaginary sins were committed were obscure to me.  The manipulation of Darger's images were always deeply respectful and loving.  The critics here are acting as if the filmmaker was sinning against Darger instead of affectionately trying to tell his story.  They may not like the decision that was made, but there is absolutely nothing inherently wrong in it.",1209772800,5,3354,4.809440559440559
2265942,3,B00094ARX2,"His work is amazing. What a prolific artist. If only I could be so productive with my work. Henry Darger lived in his world though. He was creating an alternative world in which he could control what happens. It sometimes felt like therapy, company or maddness. His genious is evident in his story telling and artwork. You never know who may be living next door to you. He may not have been much to notice in life but his work will hopefully live on forever.",1207526400,,458,4.4
2265943,4,B00094ARX2,"""In the Realms of the Unreal"" is the story of Henry Darger, a janitor who lived a quiet but troubled existence in Chicago. Suffering over the death of his parents, the adoption of his sister, and years in homes for unwanted children, Henry spends his adult life sequestered in a make-believe one room world trying to work out the pain of his childhood through art.

After Henry is moved to a nursing home in the 1970's, his neighbors find his art work and are amazed at Henry's rich imaginary life. His room, drawings and novels are preserved in their original state until 2000. The film tells the story of Henry Darger's life from three points of view-his neighbors, his own words as found in his novel, and the voice of a child who narrates from a omnipresent point of view.

Henry's novels and art are obsessed with themes of justice-particularly for children, theology, and family. Wars are fought to end child slavery. ""General"" Henry Darger is his own hero, enlisted for the cause because he is a ""known defender of children"". In real life, Henry prayed, often going to mass several  times a day, begging God for an adopted child. The Catholic Charities turn down Henry's application for adoption. His rage and pain are turned to the page where Henry enlists the ""General"" to the other side to defeat the Christian armies. Eventually the ""General"" becomes afraid of hell and becomes a defender of the Christian faith again. Henry resigns himself to a life of quiet desperation and poverty in his old age. He even denies himself the dog he so desperately wants because sadly, he does not think he can afford the five dollars a month upkeep. In Henry's life, the paint and pencil and scrap paper found in dumpsters are the only refuge of fairness.

This is a good film, but sadly some of the issues which are so glaringly present are never addressed. For example, it seems obvious to me that Henry was sexually abused as a child and was almost obsessively guilty over it, but the topic never comes up by the film maker. In the end, you'll have more questions about Henry Darger than you'll have answers. But this may be the way Henry would have wanted his life presented. He did, afterall, tell his landlord that ""life had many questions, and not very many answers"".",1204329600,7,2270,4.653366583541147

2265958,3,B00094ARX2,"Henry Darger is very inspirational. To characterize his art, as some have, as an offshoot of mental illness is insulting to Darger's legacy. Because he was different, solitary, does not make him mentally ill - he seemed to function as a person, hold a job, etc - why does this make him insane? Choosing solitude should not be considered an illness.

The director took too much liberty in the choice to animate his drawings, and did it badly, to add insult to injury. Underemphasis on the Catholicism is also a problem. I hate to bring it up, but perhaps being Asian might be a slight barrier to fully understanding the Catholic aspect.

The little girl voice is especially irritating, as it sounds like she needs to blow her nose really badly throughout all her narrations. I kept wanting to shout ""Hey, somebody get the litte girl a kleenex!""",1182816000,2,843,4.6891891891891895
2265959,4,B00094ARX2,"This is a fascinating film of one of the 20th Centuries most important artists: Henry Darger. Filmmaker Jessica Yu had some hard choices to make, but presents a Darger self portrait, an observers portrait, and partial exploration of Darger's interior world in the film's three narrative veins.

My own criticism, and this is frankly a minor quibble, is that too little is made of Darger's Catholicism. Henry Darger assisted (read: attended) at Mass sometimes five times a day, this in addition to his life's work, and his job, and his weather observations. Too little is made of this dimension of Darger's self-construct and in the way others saw him.

But this is a forgivable flaw. Jessica Yu's portrait is an excellent first approximation of a fascinating artist and man, and her film invokes the lesson amplified by Walker Percy and commanded by the Church: there is an infinity in any human soul. May we meet Henry Darger in paradise now that we have been given the grace to see his interior world this side of the veil.",1176422400,,1025,4.785310734463277
2265960,5,B00094ARX2,"To me, the most fascinating aspect of this movie is that Henry seemed to be utterly ignorant of the differences between boys and girls.  When I was growing up, nudity between the sexes was utterly taboo - we had to be very careful to explore each other without alerting out parents.  Those little kids who did not have or take those opportunities invariably said the sexual differences were that boys had short hair and wore pants and girls had long hair and wore dresses.  Henry either never was able to see the physical differences between the sexes, or he did so late he was psychologically unable to accept the differences.  Thus, he drew his naked little girls as he would have imagined them as a little boy - like his body, but with long hair.

Unable to relate to the opposite sex, which also would have made him an oddity to his own sex, he withdrew more and more into his own imaginary world.  In an effort to make sense of his life, and possibly to find some social acceptance, he grew into a faithful Catholic.  He might have felt at home in the Church because he learned sexual mores through the Catholic orphanages he grew up in, and then those mores were reinforced through the Church in homilies and other teachings of the late 19th Century and early 20th Century.

This movie is a study of this interrelation between his utter lack of knowledge, yet fascination with little girls and his absorption of the catechism of the Catholic Church.  To create his own reality since he couldn't comprehend the larger social actuality, he wrote and drew the world as he saw it within this context.  The movie, especially to one who is interested in sexual paraphilias or sexual immaturity in an adult, is interesting in this respect.",1156464000,5,1738,4.613636363636363
2265961,5,B00094ARX2,"Every time I learn about a new artist, a writer or an otherwise creative genius, I wonder where the heck I've been! This same sense of wonderment, alternating with a tad bit of embarrassment, always makes me want to find out more about a creative force who had been in our midst all along!

Scholars can argue the deep religious overtones while others try to dissect and ferret out hidden meanings. It would take years of studying the pictures & the text, and even then, we ultimately would never know what REALLY was in Henry Darger's mind all the years he was spinning the tales of the Glandelinians and the Vivian Girls.

Sit back, watch & try to grasp the sheer volumes of work that Henry poured out over the course of his life! Was he crazy-mad? Who wouldn't be with the type of real-world existence he lived. Perhaps, escaping into his fantasy world kept him from going over the edge. Who will ever know? I, myself, was MESMERIZED by this unknown but gifted man who used everyday things around him to fashion an intriguing legacy of wild imagination!

After first seeing this on PBS, I rushed to the computer to research and find out MORE about this reclusive man. I HAD to buy the DVD & intend to share it with those around me who hold the same type of fascination with learning about new talents.

Too bad that Henry Darger didn't live long enough to be interviewed for this documentary. I wonder what he would think about being declared a new American Folk Artist? We can only guess. Simply enjoy the voluminous works that he so graciously left behind for generations to enjoy.",1152144000,2,1586,4.554385964912281
2265962,1,B00094ARX2,"Here's a fantastic idea: Let's make a documentary about someone about whom there is virtually NO information, just bits and pieces culled from the memories of strangers who came into contact with him once or twice some 30-odd years ago, who accomplished absolutely nothing save for writing and illustrating a voluminous fantasy novel that no one will ever read.

I guess his art is okay, I just don't really think there is ANYTHING about a reclusive old janitor who wrote a book that is remotely interesting, and in my opinion, the filmmakers did nothing to convince me otherwise.",1151452800,4,580,4.918367346938775
2265963,4,B00094ARX2,"Henry Darger was a janitor. He lived in one room. He cleaned a Catholic hospital for fifty years, and then died with a 15,000 page manuscript and yards and yards of artwork, unknown and unpublished, in his room. You can find out more about Henry Darger and his life work, chronicling the adventures of ""The Vivian Girls"" at the Henry Darger entry on Wikipedia.

""In the Realms of the Unreal"" is a documentary about his life. The narrative comes through a few different sources: There are interviews with those who knew of Darger in his last days, including the landlords who discovered his work. There is an old man's voice reading Darger's autobiography. There are pieces of Darger's novel. Then there is a narrator who is about 5 years old, providing a little summary and connectivity now and then. The visuals behind the readings are sometimes photos of relevant locations, like the state farm where Darger spent his late childhood, or the hospital where he worked most of his life. Sometimes they are stills or animations of Darger's artwork.

The life of Henry Darger is fascinating. It's especially intriguing to think that there are people around us who are silently, secretly living these incredibly rich and complicated internal lives. It's sad that Darger was never ""discovered,"" but even that sadness is complicated. I'm not sure what the world would have done with him, had we known what he was about. His was not the type of art that's comfortable to package and sell. Hard to contemplate a lonely old man drawing pictures of naked children, unless you put it in the context of his whole life. Not easy to reduce to a few key words.

The movie was kind of distancing. I came away knowing more about Darger but I felt unsatisfied somehow, like some primary source had been held back, like everything had been too filtered, too disjointed. Maybe it just goes with the subject matter -- Darger was a recluse, not open to interpretation or summary. The most meaningful parts to me were the pieces read from his autobiography. It was surprisingly kind, chatty, a bit apologetic, and patient. No bitterness. No angst. Isn't that strange.",1144713600,4,2144,4.820652173913044
2265964,1,B00094ARX2,"This ""documentary"" is a blatant attempt to contribute to and fester the 'myth' of Henry Darger, a reclusive, backward man who concocted a trite and repetitive story (18,000 pages) filled with extreme inconsistencies (his ""Christian"" army is involved in bloody warfare - tenets of Christ were those of a pacifist, etc) and sadomasochistic tendencies.  It seems he lived in his own sullied world, formed mostly by an extreme fascination with children and the sufferings of Christ (he had upon his wall 13,000 representations of crucifixes).  His landlords found his room after he died, stuffed with inumerable articles of junk, stacks of wet papers, hairballs, empty bottles and yet, being artists and entrepreneurs themselves, they hatched a theme to create Henry Darger as a genius of 'outsider art', their attempts succeeded, Darger's immature works, mostly traced drawings, slapped on with some vivid color schemata, in every sense lacking any cohesive aesthetic, have sold for millions now.

  The room itself was photographed, cataloged and inducted into the 'folk art' hall of fame.  Darger was seemingly a lunatic, at odds with his warped Christian conditioning and society itself, he would hide in his room for hours on end, lusting after children and cut out articles and trace faces onto pieces of toilet paper (he was poor).  There's no doubt that he holds some fascination for us, mainly because of his weirdness but eventually even that is usurped by the painstaking tediousness and forcefulness of accepting such unworthy levels of art into our consciousness, as this documentary begs us to do.

Since he is dead, he can not speak for himself, and thus, his 'myth' is assurred, bringing the curious to worship at his feet and sell his works for staggering prices.",1143504000,9,1776,5.142361111111111

Henry Darger was an egg of another shape, a different kind of life for sure.

You owe it yourself to see this film. If nothing else it speaks brialliantly to variety in human experience. And I love his vendetta against the weatherman.

2265986,3,B00094ARX2,"I must agree with some of the previous reviews.  This Darger character is pretty interesting and the works he produced are quite astounding, if not a bit infantile.

Nevertheless, I found the documentary difficult to follow.  For me, I was definitely not a fan of using Dakota Fanning, or any other child's voice to narrate many portions of the film.  The kid's voice was simply grating.  One shouldn't be constantly reminded of ""poltergeist"" (theeey're here...) when trying to  watch a film about a Chicago janitor.

What is truly unconscionable is the fact that the director choose to ""animate"" Darger's paintings.  This is very disappointing and suggests that the director did not have enough confidence in either the subject matter or the audience.  When showing Darger's paintings, I didn't need to see little soldier's arms moving in some rip-off Monty Python-esque style.  To me, this ploy reflected inexperience not artistry.  Just imagine a film about Ed Paschke in which his flourescent wrestlers and other characters ""came alive"" and started moving their arms and speaking--it would be ridiculous and an insulting move by the director (note, in no way am I comparing Paschke to Darger).

It's worth noting that most of the reviews posted here give people's opinions about Darger himself, not the movie.  Darger's idiosyncratic lifestyle is more than suitable for a documentary, I just didn't particularly care for the style that Yu chose to represent the story.

In all, this could have been a much more watchable documentary had it simply followed a more basic format.  Sure, I can understand that documentary filmmakers, like other artists, should push the boundaries of their genre.  However, the sign of a good filmmaker is someone who knows when to push the boundaries and when to simply let the material speak for itself.  Yu does way too much of the former, and the result is a film that seems  to promote its own cleverness at the expense of Darger's.",1126828800,6,1970,5.009230769230769

The idea of using a b acting stereotypical sothern normal voice to be his voice is assuming everything,stupid and not even interesting or creative. The animation world created by animating the paintings may be presenting a pyschological flavor not of darger at all. So in the end there is no movie just the illusion of one.
Harris flug-ps the director in her interview is very pure in thought&emotion&so is in contrast to the film.

2265988,2,B00094ARX2,"This ""film"" is a documentary about a recluse who, it was found after his death, wrote a 15,000 page tale, with illustrations. We, the audience, are lead to believe that this tale is a masterpiece, due to the fact that it was created over the course of a lifetime. But what we find is a disjointed, poorly written child's story that could have been less than 100 pages.

The novel was the only outlet for the author, a fanatically religious man with a terrible childhood. We learn throughout the documentary that the man, Darger, was a quiet man who took all his personal troubles throughout his days, and spilled them out onto the pages of his story at night. It works better as a personal journal into Darger's own mind than as a work of fiction. Many of the characters are named after people he had known (his impression of them is evident as to whether the character is good or bad), and some situations were directly related to his own quarrels with faith.

The only thing of true interest here is examining his illustrations, and Jessica Yu's animations (using the illustrations). I can say many things about his writing, but his paintings/sketches/cut and pastings are wonderful.

While Darger made a living in jobs such as janitor, he never sought fame nor monetary rewards.  The output of his obsessive behavior was totally unknown to others, and not discovered until after his death. Luckily these works were appreciated when found by his landlord, who recognized the creative effort for what it was.

2265992,4,B00094ARX2,"""In the Realms of the Unreal"" explores the life and work of Henry Darger, a reclusive Chicago janitor who died in 1973, leaving behind 30,000 pages of writings and hundreds of pieces of artwork which no one knew existed while he lived. Director Jessica Yu approaches Darger's story from three points of view: that of Henry, himself, which he recorded in an autobiography; how those who knew him saw Henry; and the story told in Henry's magnum opus, a 15,000-page novel, laboriously entitled ""The Story of the Vivian Girls, in What is known as the Realms of the Unreal, of the Glandeco-Angelinnian War Storm, Caused by the Child Slave Rebellion"".

Larry Pine provides Henry's voice, as he narrates his Dickensonian childhood and youth, thorough an adulthood of self-imposed isolation and struggles with faith, to this reluctant retirement. Luckily, his autobiography is frank, because Henry avoided interaction with people and spent every spare moment in his room creating the universe of his novel. Interviews with neighbors, landlords, and acquaintances allow us to see Henry as others did. As Henry's life unfolds, his novel, which he began in 1909 at the age of 17, progresses. The book is about a war between the Christian nation of Abbieannia and the land of Glandelinia, where children are enslaved. The heroes are the 7 cheeky, brave, and saint-like Vivian girl princesses, who lead the child slave rebellion. The novel is narrated by Dakota Fanning. And animators have brought Darger's fascinating illustrations to life in stunning visuals.

Jessica Yu is to be commended for encouraging viewers to come to their own conclusions about Henry Darger. The vibrancy, overwhelming innocence, and creativity of Darger's artwork has made it valuable today. But the artist chose to exist primarily within a fantasy of his own making, writing and painting only for himself. To me, the most fascinating aspect of Henry Darger's work is that it seems like a complete account of someone's fantasy life -which is a rare thing to find. Artists may wonder at the implications of Henry's creating art for ""an audience of one"". ""In the Realms of the Unreal"" is an intriguing, beautiful look at art, isolation, and the world within.
