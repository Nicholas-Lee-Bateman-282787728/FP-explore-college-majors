8304,5,0767813421,"It's very funny comedy about a genie named Jeannie who stuck inside a bottle for 2000 years before finally discovered by astronout named Major Anthony Nelson. Jeannie swore that whoever set her free from the bottle  will become her master. Jeannie can make all major nelson's wishes come  true. But, Jeannie's magic always cause him in trouble. It's one of the  best comedy I have ever seen. two tumbs up !!",923356800,11,407,4.704225352112676
8365,4,0767813421,Eden was superb in the lead. She was amazing at conveying both sex appeal and innocence at the same time. The characters on the show are sometimes a little uneven by the way they're written from ep to ep but the talent of the actors overcomes this small fault. I liked the show much better when it switched to color (it was rather dour in black and white). And I like the married Genie stories as much as the eps where's she is single.,1101600000,,435,4.190476190476191
8366,5,0767813421,"I love this tape of the early 'I Dream of Jeannie' shows.  I remembered seeing the series in color during my childhood.  It was in 1981 (when I was a teenager) I discovered the series was originally shot in black-and-white.

In addition, I heard for the first time - and came to love - the series' ORIGINAL theme score.  Unlike the familiar perky theme heard in the later 'Color' episodes, the score for the black-and-white series is slower, and romantic.  The original theme song is featured on this tape for both episodes, ""The Lady in the Bottle"" and ""My Hero"".  The first season for ""I Dream of Jeannie"" was in 1965.

In ""The Lady in the Bottle"" pilot, Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut, gets stranded on a South Pacific beach after a space mission he's on suddenly goes wrong, forcing him to make an emergency landing.  He writes S.O.S. in large letters on the sand.

As he waits for help to arrive, Nelson comes across an unusual-looking bottle lying on the sand.  After unsuccessfully placing it aside (twice, the bottle intentionally rolls at his feet), Nelson takes it up.  He unwittingly rubs it, only to release - to his surprise, a beautiful 2,000 year-old female genie (whom he calls 'Jeannie').  Kneeling and speaking in Persian, Jeannie promises to serve her 'Master' for the rest of his life, and to grant him any wish.  Jeannie seals this promise when she rises, goes over, and tenderly kisses Captain Nelson. Jeannie later helps Tony get rescued; but Tony cannot bring her with him since nobody believes in genies as they don't exist.

Jeannie returns to her bottle and sneaks into Tony's kit bag.  She later ends up in his home in Coco Beach, Florida.  Yes, this was how Jeannie and Master came together ...with many loveable, amusing mishaps to follow in future episodes to come!

In the second episode, ""My Hero"", Jeannie transports Tony back to ancient Baghdad with assorted comic situations.  Captain Nelson, as always, gets the brunt of things happening to him.  In one cute scene in the episode's beginning, Tony, after having breakfast with Jeannie, verbally wishes he could go swimming instead of going to work.  Jeannie immediately grants his wish (with her familiar blink), and Tony ends up plunging into a swimming pool that has suddenly materialized at his feet.  Jeannie laughs as Tony, surfacing, mildly reprimands her.

""My Hero"" also features a shortened version of the odd couple's romantic meeting on the beach in the opening segment.  A male narrator's voiceover informs the viewers of how the couple met, soon followed by the original romantic 'Jeannie' theme played.  This was the black-and-white episode I saw for the first time in 1981.

And for a bit of trivia:  It was in this episode that Barbara Eden was pregnant.  The extensive veil from her headpiece wrapped about her midsection hid her pregnancy.  Eden's first husband would later play the wicked genie - 'The Blue Djinn' - who imprisoned Jeannie in the first color episode of the series.  These facts are from the book ""Dreaming of Jeannie: TV's Primetime in a Bottle"", by Steve Cox -- which I own.

An interesting detail for ""The Lady In the Bottle"" episode is that the videotape version features English subtitles as Jeannie, upon being released from her bottle, speaks to Captain Nelson in Persian (before Nelson wishes that she could speak in English - which she thankfully does!). However when this episode recently aired again on TVLand, there were no subtitles.

Barbara Eden would re-create her and Captain Nelson's meeting in the 1985 T.V. movie ""I Dream of Jeannie: 15 Years Later"" - minus both Larry Hagman (who, at the time, became mean and greedy J.R. of ""Dallas""), and without the early 'Jeannie' theme song.

But the original episode is the way to go.  Get this video gem, instead.  In fact, try to get it as copies of this ""I Dream of Jeannie"" pilot episode are becoming hard-to-find.",1093737600,9,3902,4.826807228915663
8367,4,0767813421,"The three episodes collected on ""Jeannie's Seeing Stars"" come from late in the run of the classic television sitcom ""I Dream of Jeannie.""  By this point Jeannie (Barbara Eden) is married to her master, Major Anthony Nelson (Larry Hagman), with best friend Major Roger Healy (Bill Daily) still in on the secret, which is more than can be said for Dr. Alfred Bellows (Hayden Rorke).  None of these episodes would really be considered classics, but they are all certainly representative of the show:
""The Biggest Star in Hollywood"" (Episode #106) finds Tony heading for Hollywood, so Jeannie prepares a goodbye that shows up in a mirror.  The producers of ""Laugh-In"" are impressed by the trick and just have to have her on the show.  Seeing yet another opportunity to become rich and famous, Roger becomes the manager for the Princess Armena, and promises to have her on the show.  ""Laugh-In"" regulars Arte Johnson, Judy Carne, and Gary Owens appear in this average outing.
""Help, Help, a Shark"" (Episode #134) features Jim Backus as General Fitzhugh, the longtime rival of General Schaeffer (Vinton Hayworth), who are competing for a spot in the All-Military Pool Championships.  When Tony ruins Schaeffer's big game his only chance to avoid being sent to the North Pole is to play Fitzhugh in a rematch.  The good news is that with Jeannie on his side, Tony is sure to win.  The bad news is that Fitzhugh refuses to play with a woman in the room.  Of course a large part of the pleasure here is the guest appearance by Thurston Howell III himself, which makes this the best episode of this particular trio.
""My Master the Chili King"" (Episode #139) has Arvel (Gabriel Dell), who is Tony's cousin (twice removed) showing up and convincing Jeannie to invest $1,000 in his great recipe for Texas chili.  She buys his story that Tony has agreed to endorse the product and promptly blinks up cans with his picture on them and gets them on the shelves in every grocery store in the area.  The only problem is that NASA does not let its astronauts endorse products.  A solid outing as far as such things go, the episode also has Dick Van Patten as the clerk at the market.
As is usually the case, the big surprise is noting how good of a comic actor Larry Hagman was on this show, before he made his mark as J.R. Ewing on ""Dallas.""  Just watch how many times he gets to do an over the top reaction to Jeannie's antics in ""Help, Help, a Shark.""  Just do not look for Barbara Eden's navel, because although it did get seen a couple of times, these are not those episodes.",1075766400,7,2561,4.6
8368,5,0767813421,I love I Dream Of Jeannie. I watch I Dream Of Jeannie on TVLand. I like this first episode in Black & White is when Major Anthony Nelson found Jeannie on the beach. I like it when Jeannie turns into pink smoke to get into her bottle & to get out of her bottle. And also like it when Jeannie blink herself to make herself disappear. Barbara Eden did a good job playing both Jeannie & her sister. And Larry Hagman did a good job playing Major Anthony Nelson.,1068595200,,456,4.134831460674158
8369,1,0767813421,"The I dream of Jeannie series is great, however, when I bought this box set I was under the impression, from the review that is, that it contained earlier episodes (first season).  It does not.  The box set is merely the other two VHS' together. If I had known this in the beginning I would have not purchased this item.",1057795200,31,320,4.316666666666666
8370,5,0767813421,"""Genie in Training"" features three above-average episodes of ""I Dream of Jeannie,"" the NBC sitcom that aired from 1965 to 1970 and introduced television to Larry Hagman while making sure we never saw Barbara Eden's navel.  First up is ""Happy Anniversary"" (Episode 31), written by series creator Sidney Sheldon.  This is the opening episode of the show's second season, the first shown in living color, with a new cartoon opening and the familiar theme song.  Jeannie has big plans for enjoying the first anniversary of her bottle being discovered by Tony, who, of course, has forgotten all about it and is due to be sent into orbit.  History repeats itself as Tony crash lands on their island, but this time the bottle holds not Jeanie, but the Blue Djinn (Michael Ansara), the evil genie who imprisoned our heroine two thousand years ago.  Looks like Major Nelson will appreciate Jeannie a lot more after this one.
In ""My Master, the Weakling"" (Episode 66), Don Rickles plays physical trainer Commander ""Killer"" Kiski, who decides Tony and Roger (Billy Daily) are weaklings and need to be whipped into shape.  However, Jeannie will only put up for this nonsense for so long before turns the tables on ""Killer"" by giving him the temperament of his sweet old auntie.  Look quick for David Soul as an orderly, years before he went on to fame in ""Starsky & Hutch.""
Finally, ""My Son the Genie"" (Episode 74), has Bob Denver visiting the Nelsons as Harold, an apprentice genie who has to spend the day with Jeannie to complete his training.  The problem is that the President of the United States is coming to dinner to congratulate Tony on his latest trip into space and Harold insists on making the dinner.  Wackiness ensues, as you would expect with any sit com on which Bob Denver appears.  For fans of Jeannie this is one of the better tapes available.",1012608000,28,1851,4.75625
8371,5,0767813421,"In these episodes, Jeannie charms not only the viewers,but famous actors from the 60's,including stars from the hit shows, ""Laugh-In""& """"Gilligan's Island."" This is truly some of my favorite  episodes! A must see!",961372800,5,213,5.454545454545454

7788797,4,0767813421,"Sony has released a collection of ""Fan Favourites"" DVD titles, taken from several of their most popular back-catalogue TV series. These are specially-priced for those who only want a small sampling of episodes from their favourite show, or even for a budget Christmas stocking stuffer. Whether or not the company actually approached ""fans"" to vote for their ""favourites"" is very suspect, however, because the episodes featured here are presented in their original order, just like on the Complete Fifth Season set from which they originate.  Any real ""fan favourites"" disc would surely include the Pilot episode and other stories from the first season, where the show was at it's freshest.

This I DREAM OF JEANNIE disc features seven episodes from the fifth (and final) season.

""The Blood of a Jeannie"" - Things get sticky when Jeannie (Barbara Eden) informs Tony (Larry Hagman) that genies have green corpuscles instead of red ones.  The problem is that she has to pass a blood test before they are married!

""See You in C.U.B.A."" - Jeannie repeatedly blinks Tony down from an experimental aircraft on it's way to Puerto Rico (say hello to ""The Flying Nun""!).  Everything goes wrong when Jeannie accidentally blinks Tony - and the aircraft - to Havana Cuba instead.

""Jeannie and the Mad Home Wrecker"" - As an early wedding gift, Dr. and Amanda Bellows give Jeannie and Tony a grotesque piece of modern art.  Things only get worse when the NASA staff chips in to have the same artist re-decorate Tony's entire house!

""Uncles a Go-Go"" - In order for Jeannie to marry, one of her uncles must approve of her husband-to-be.  The only problem is that two uncles show up, and Tony has to make BOTH of the men happy.

""The Wedding"" - Camera-shy Jeannie must come up with a reason why she cannot allow photography at her wedding...genies don't photograph!  Too bad that half the press in Washington has descended for the big day!

""My Sister, the Homewrecker"" - Jeannie's brunette twin makes one final grab for the affections of Tony.  This time, she poses as Jeannie and leads Roger and the Bellows' to believe that she's cheating on Tony.

""Jeannie, the Matchmaker"" - Feeling sorry for Roger, Jeannie finds him a date at the computer dating agency.  At the same time, Tony arranges a date for Roger with the General's niece...on the same night!",1283126400,7,2342,4.846733668341709
7788798,1,0767813421,"This is a terrible DVD.  Sony has decided to take Disc 2 of the Season 5 DVD set and sell it as a Fan Favorites DVD.  A real Fan Favorites DVD would have included the Pilot and the first Djinn Djinn episode.  In this case, Disc 2 from Season 5 featured episodes that aired around the wedding episode.  Shameless and lazy marketing from Sony.

If you really want to buy this DVD, you're better off just buying it as part of the entire Season 5 set.  Or better yet, buy the whole series if you don't already own it.",1255651200,18,513,4.1313131313131315
