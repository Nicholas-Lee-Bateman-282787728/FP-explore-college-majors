This series begins all anew with more human elements. the only real transformers in the sense of sentient robot life forms are the pretenders and they maintain human for most of the time. The humans end up finding the ""godmasters"" which we would know as powermasters in the US which are basically lifeless machines that the humans themselves end up combining with and controlling. Powermaster Optimus Prime is really God Ginrai in this series and ill admit at first i was dissapointed that it wasn't prime but eventually the storytelling is so great that you immerse yourself in the Ginrai character and forget that he even looks like Prime and he is able to stand on his own. ALL IN ALL a GREAT series a little pricy i would like to see a north american release but well worth checking out if you're a true Transformers fan. This series is followed by VICTORY with the great STAR SABER in my opinion the greatest of the transformers series and masterforce does lend itself to that series as well.",1325980800,3,1113,4.649746192893401
8639261,5,7884068818,"When I watched the first episode, I thought it was revolting at face-value, and a little too violent nothing like G1. As a manual describes ""more human""  than mechinanized characteristics. In retrospect it has the premise of Dragonballz, they have similar qualities.i.e. The Saiyans and Frieza...Transform. Allow the story to unfold one episode after another and you will see how hot it gets. Possibly the hottest of all The Transformers epics. Masterforce has good moments of heroism.
