3176336,4,B0017XRLSI,"It's a cheapo, B-grade movie with no one in it you ever heard of.

Having said that...it's fantastic!

It's a little slow getting started, but once things start to go downhill for the main characters, the movie is extremely suspenseful, exciting, and entirely realistic.

I enjoyed this a lot more than some recent big-budget A-list thrillers.",1219017600,3,343,5.089285714285714

8267821,5,B0017XRLSI,"When I got this movie, it was just because...no real reason I 5thought a good way to kill some time. I was so wrong. I grant you the characters are typical for this kind of movie and the plot is typical too but it is the young actors that make the difference here. I know it is the we should never have come to this place type of story but give it a shot, really. Young me go to a rave and tick off the locals. Go from there. The performances are whgat make the difference and they are all great, Eric Christian Olsen, Rider Strong, Bumper Robinson and Wayne Young. the female lead is terrific too and she is Genevieve Cortese. The bad guy and he is bad and threatening and scary is Dash Mihok. Gie this movie a shot. some violence and a few other things make this not for kids at all, late teens and up.",1411430400,,804,4.062893081761007

8267823,5,B0017XRLSI,"I picked this movie up at the weekend here in Australia for just $5.00.

I love watching movies at home but usually when doing so I always take a break to get a cup of coffee or whatever, but this movie kept me glued to my seat.

I agree with the other reviews that the movie is a bit slow to start off with, but once it gets going, there's no stopping it!  Great acting, direction and storyline. It's a survival type movie set in the desert, but not from the elements, it's from a crazed gang out to get a group of innocent friends.",1315094400,3,533,4.057142857142857
8267824,2,B0017XRLSI,"'Death Valley' is a little frustrating at first becasue we all know what this film is about, but the makers of this film want to bore us to death before getting on with the show! Once it gets there it's a pretty good survial horror tale with some fairly realistic reactions. The cast is pretty good for this type of stuff, but the slow first half really takes this one down a notch. I've seen worse, but I've seen a lot better too. It's worth a look on cable or a cheap rental for a few thrills.",1250380800,2,495,4.11340206185567
8267825,4,B0017XRLSI,"I didn't think this movie had much of a chance of winning me over at first, since the development of the story in the beginning was so slow, not to mention quite typical of the ""teenagers party and do drugs"" routine that's in so many movies nowadays.

But then the main part of the storyline kicked in where these punks out in the desert came into the picture and started threatening and torturing the group of young teens, forcing them to do what the bad guys said.

The punks themselves were quite young, perhaps even younger than the innocent teens. They did a good job striking fear into the minds of the innocent teens.

One of the bad guys dies, while his friend manages to get away on his motorcycle. He returns a short time later with a BUNCH of his thug friends (along with more guns) and this is where the storyline really picks up and why I'm giving the movie four stars out of five.

The only problem is that the movie is quite short overall, and the main part of the storyline with the innocent teens trying to find a way to outsmart the bad guys by killing them when they least expect it was only about 30 minutes long. There needed to be more to it since this is supposed to be the main reason we're watching the movie in the first place, but other than that, the story delivered with suspense, kills, violence, and excitement.

Oh, and MAN does the young blonde-haired guy who plays the main character in the film look exactly like the guy from the hit TV show Criminal Minds!",1248825600,2,1492,4.35251798561151
8267826,4,B0017XRLSI,"""Death Valley"" is a good,well acted survival revenge thriller.
With great actors such as Rider Storm""Cabin Fever"" and ""Borderland"" and gorgeous Eric Christian Olsen .
The quality is not that good as this is a a B movie  but I prefer the more grainy look this movie has opposed to B movies that look like a home movie..
It starts off a little slow but once the action starts it never lets up and the ending was satisfying to me as well.
I recommend it to anyone who likes the ""stuck in the middle of nowhere with a bunch of socipaths flicks""
think of it as ""The Hills Have Eyes "" with regular people not mutants ,it's light on gore but it still delivers.",1226793600,5,653,4.266129032258065
8267827,1,B0017XRLSI,"I really wanted to see this film as I was on the set for one day.  The content of the film is good; an interesting horror film.  The one bad thing is that when the film producers transfered it from film to DVD, they did not correct the color, nor had the DOP there when they did it. the DOP certainly would not have let it go to DVD the way it was done.  So much of the film is almost too black to really enjoy it.  There are times when the actors faces seemed like they had some neon lights on them-black with odd green patches. Bumper's face was almost impossible to see in close-ups.  You could not really see the facial expressions in a lot of the scenes so you could not really get a feel for what they were going through. For me it was a waste of money just buying the DVD.",1219708800,,779,3.967948717948718
