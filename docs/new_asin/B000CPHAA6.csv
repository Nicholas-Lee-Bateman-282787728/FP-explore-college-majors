2468588,5,B000CPHAA6,"This is a wonderful documentary that follows the lives of two boys, Chris and Cody, growing up in Eastern Kentucky from ages 15-18.  Each boy has significant family problems to deal with.  Chris's father is unemployed and a severe alcoholic.  Cody is an orphan being raised by his step-grandmother.  They go to an alternative private school, which is a last resort for troubled kids.  They are trying hard, and you can't help hoping they'll beat the odds.  Highly recommended.",1137369600,5,476,4.962025316455696
2468589,5,B000CPHAA6,"If anyone ever needs a reminder of the old maxim ""life isn't fair"", they needn't look much further than this absolutely amazing documentary.

""Country Boys"" is just as frustrating and disheartening to watch as it is uplifting and optimistic; very few movies contain such dichotomy of human emotion without coming off as contrived, but this one really makes it happen. The story of these boys lives dance wildly between tragedy, cautionary tale and uplifting tear-jerker and as you watch, with each passing minute, you never know where you're going to wind up.

In my opinion, there are a few criticisms from a film-making standpoint.

Some of the voice editing was done for dramatic effect and clearly doesn't coincide with what's happening on the screen. For example, a scene of one character driving away in the car while having an argument with his mother contains after-added dialog that obviously didn't occur at that very moment, but due to clever editing, it probably fools most of the viewers into thinking that what they're hearing is what was said.

Also, in my opinion, the story of one character is- clearly- far more interesting than the other (I won't bother saying which one, but I think everyone who has seen the film knows, as I have yet to encounter anyone who disagrees) yet a great deal of time was expended on detailing the minutiae of the less interesting storyline of the other main participant.

Nevertheless, this movie is- in every way, shape and form- five strong stars. I find myself thinking about these people to this day, almost a year after I first viewed the picture.

It's one of those DVD's that if you buy it, you won't ever resell it.",1183420800,,1671,4.804878048780488
2468590,4,B000CPHAA6,"Here are about 5 years in the life of two young boys from the Appalachian mountains of Kentucky. They go to an alternative school, and we observe their daily lives go by up to the time they graduate from High School. The filmmaker is never heard or seen, which is good: this way we can relate more fully with Cody and Chris, who soon get used to carrying the mike on their clothes and they carry on with their lives in the most natural way possible (still, I wonder how much influence did this fact, being taped for a documentary, play in their daily decisions, in the outcome of the film. I think it helped them more than not. Knowledge of being watched and taped constantly must have made them, at least, a little more responsible for the decisions they were making).

The good thing about documentaries like this one is that you can pick up whatever interests you most. Here are some samples:  1. Who's: who is more (and why) likable; who had it toughest; who do I identify most with; 2. What's: what are the things I don't like (or approve) of them; what were the critical decisions they had to make; what would I have done differently. You can also focus on the secondary characters: the principal and teachers; how important a role did they play in these kids' lives, and would I have done something differently? And, of course, we can look at the social and economical conditions of both their families. One kid had it much easier financially than the other, but how much did that influence at the finish line?

There are lots of things you can look into. One of the most interesting ones to me was their familiar surroundings, their relatives, and immediate family members. Or rather lack of family. Put the terrible familiar conditions in which both kids started out in a more global perspective (say, the whole US), and think how many kids in America start out in life with that huge burden. Lack of fatherhood is the biggest problem in the our Western societies. Little else is needed to overload our kids. Our welfare systems can't cope with all this; actually it's (in my modest opinion) the growing presence of the welfare system that keeps pushing away parents from the responsibilities that are theirs by nature's law.

The director, David Sutherland, seems to take aim at the implications of the ever present religious billboards; and at Cody's obvious religious sentiments, however confused they are. The implications are there for us to figure out; and every person will probably make his own conclusions.

One final thing: I think we are putting too much responsibility on the backs of kids; everything, and all the time, was about them. It all depended on their choices. But they had NOBODY TO BE ACCOUNTABLE TO. This is what we have taught them: they can do whatever they want, it's their lives, and we only give advise but don't implicate ourselves. All the adults are very (outwardly) concerned about their ""making it"" to the finish line, and this meaning graduating and going to college. But why should that be the only goal. Are we so downright materialists? Well, somebody may not ""make it"" there, then what? game over? In this sense the film was really saddening because it tell us pretty loudly that our whole society is missing the point. If graduating going to college to become a money thirsty lawyer is all we have to inculcate to our kids, we are in bad shape indeed. Where's the love, altruism, compassion, respect; where are the dreams? No family. No values. Not even dreams (besides becoming rich). The message is not optimistic.",1181606400,2,3566,4.6900958466453675
2468591,5,B000CPHAA6,I actually bought this as a gift for a friend because I had seen it when it was on PBS. It is a remarkable story and I highly recommend it. My friend is now also a believer and thought the story was very inspirational.,1163030400,3,218,3.977272727272727
2468592,5,B000CPHAA6,I am only 15 and my friend told me to watch it and i thought it was an amazing movie. I really felt like I knew them. I think that every person my age should watch it because it opens your eyes to people who don't have it as good as you do. But still they strive for more. I could never get tired of it.,1155600000,3,303,3.606060606060606

2468594,5,B000CPHAA6,"I saw this documentary when it was shown earlier this year on PBS & I am still thinking about Chris & Cody & wonder how they're doing. I can't express how much this film touched me. It's a magnificent piece of work. Thank you, David Sutherland, AND Chris & Cody!",1142899200,6,262,4.26
2468595,5,B000CPHAA6,"Perhaps my rating of this film is a bit biased.  I'm from Knott County, KY, which borders Floyd County where the film takes place.  I know boys just like Chris Johnson and Cody Perkins, struggling to make it through high school because of various tragic reasons.  The duality of both ""needing"" an education and ""not getting above your raisings"" echos strongly throughout this film and throughout this region.  It is a struggle for many young people to balance strong family ties and their own personal ambitions.  I appreciate Sutherland's truthfulness to the reality of eastern Kentucky and to the very real struggles young people go through without using stereotype or judgement.

I will remember Country Boys for years to come as a film important to local and Appalachian studies.  Apart from its stance as a regional piece, this is an entertaining documentary. Beautifully-shot and well-directed.",1140739200,7,900,5.165517241379311

2468598,5,B000CPHAA6,"I first saw ""Country Boys"" one evening after groggily scrolling through the channels until I got to PBS. There, I found an ""docudrama"" about two appalachian boys called Cody and Chris, following their trials and tribulations while attending a private high school. So engrossed was I, I watched the next two ""installments,"" staying up past my ""bedtime"" to do so. Now, of course, I won't have to stay up beause I just ordered this beautiful film on DVD.

""Country Boys"" had all the fixin's for being a ""pitying"" film. That is, it is a film about two poor boys attending a school for the academically struggling in Eastern Kentucky. Cody does not have parents (his father murdered his mother when he was very young.) Chris had an alcoholic father and a mother trying to make it any way she can. But far from pitying its subjects, we get to see not only the dark side, but the bright side, of each boy's life. We get to see not only failures (there are some of those), but successes. You will think about these boys and this town long after the 6 hours of film is over.

What really affected me about the film was that you get a real sense not only of who these boys are, but what the community is like. From the close-knit family that is the David School (the private high school for the acedemically challenged) to Cody and Chris's respective support ""networks,"" you see both the ugliness and beauty that is Appalachia.

This is one of the few films that I have had trouble not thinking too much about after it was over. Now, all I have to do is wait for the DVD to come.",1137542400,14,1569,4.403448275862069
8100060,5,B000CPHAA6,"A stunning and poignant look at the realities of life in Eastern Kentucky. The only thing that stings is that life for kids in Chris and Cody's agre group has only gotten far harder since fantastic director David Sutherland visited there for this documentary. I'd love to see what Sutherland could do with a return visit and new documentary on either of the Country Boys--or a new angle altogether. I was hooked on this documentary as it aired live on PBS in 2006, and it has never left my mind since.",1489881600,,501,4.516483516483516
8100061,5,B000CPHAA6,"A true story about two boys from Kentucky and their struggle to survive. Based on Cody, a young kid,trying to survive after his father killed his mother when he was younger,now living with his step grandmother Liz. A strict religious woman who took in a boy that needed her. While under Liz's care, Cody learns his Aunts and Uncles were stealing his inheritance money awarded to hi after his mother's death. He's seen going to a continuation school in the early 2000's. Trying to live a normal life of a young man his age,dating a nice girl He will come to later marry. Next the film speaks to Chris, A nice kid..again lot's of family problems stopping him from becoming who He would really want to be. Has to help his family most days instead of going to school. His father is an alcoholic with cirrhosis,his mother soon leaves the family inevitably making Chris the head of the household by his Senior year of high school taking care of the traylor payment,and his little sister! I won't tell you how the film ends, this is a beautiful film of true life and a journey you should really watch and experience. My husband and I when we first got married and one night in our new home, turned on Frontline on PBS, We were immediately intrigued with these realer than real life folks,trying to live a normal life. You need to remember this is before all the reality shows! After 12 years of us using the phrase, CODY CODY CODY!!!I I was so happy to see a reasonable price for a good quality used cd. I purchased and presented it to him on Father's day,his smile said enough. These boys are part of our families beginning in a way. I must say, the way the boys were brought up was hugely different than anything I ever experienced throughout those years they filmed, yet at the same time I could see some of my  own struggles they where presenting.  Again, a beautiful, beautiful film. Follows both the boys throughout their high school years. I would also like to add, I spoke to Cody on social media soon after We recieved the disks. He's remarried, has a few kids, still rockin the goth look!!! Party on Cody,glad to see you doing so well. You deserve it! Chris on the other hand has not been seen much throughout the years. He's rumored to be working up at the coal mines as security. I wish him the best~",1468368000,,2305,4.446808510638298
8100062,2,B000CPHAA6,"The first kid is named Cody.  Cody intentionally estranges himself with the local community by painting his nails black, dying his long hair, and playing heavy metal music in rural Appalachia.  He talks back to his teachers and every authority figure he encounters and has the attitude of a sage, even though he is an underachieving teenager.  He seems very difficult to deal with as he doesn't seem to listen to a word that is said. He's too busy trying to challenge adults and their beliefs.

The second kid is named Chris.  This guy got on my nerves after about five minutes.  He is utterly EXHAUSTING to deal with.  This is a classic example of someone who has been dealing with 'the system' for so long that he knows exactly what to say at any time to get off the hook for a few more days.  He agrees with everything the adults around him say, ""Yea, a college degree is the way to go.""  That way they'll leave him alone for the next few days so he can sit on his ass and smoke cigarettes.  They'll ask him a week later where his homework is, and he'll come up with a sad sorry excuse like, my dad is a drunk and I don't have a ride.  So some poor sap teacher will drive him around for a while and extend his deadline once again while he goes back to doing nothing.  He seems to enjoy failing as he signs up for responsibilities and then bails on them.  Nothing is ever his fault, he uses his failures to gain sympathy.  He never has anything positive to say.  Nothing in his life is ever finite.  It's always, ""I'll try.""  or ""We'll see.""  or ""I SHOULD be able to get it done.""  He's just EXHAUSTING and his only existence is to just peddle his self loathing from one authority figure to the next.  Always trying to buy just a few more days so he can mope around do nothing.",1350691200,,1779,4.238095238095238
8100063,1,B000CPHAA6,"My wife and I both have family in Appalachia. So, we thought that the documentary Country Boys would be great. We were wrong. After about 20 minutes, we were giving each other puzzled looks. Then things got worse.

Country Boys focuses on two impoverished teens in eastern Kentucky. Both come from dysfunctional families and attend an alternative high school. Neither is interesting or likable.

Chris Johnson is reasonably intelligent, but can't leave the alternative school because his family will lose the check that they receive for his fake disability. Chris volunteers to start a school newspaper then disappears for weeks so that he won't have to finish it. He whines because he can't get a driver's license unless he stays in school.

Cody Perkins inanely mumbles about Christianity and his hair while fighting with his teachers. He spends long, boring stretches with his girlfriend Jessica. Cody's grandmother finds evidence of their love in the form of a used condom that Cody threw on his bedroom's floor.

As the film wore on, we both gave in and started laughing at things that weren't supposed to be funny. Cody's hard rock Christian songwriting is much worse than any Spinal Tap song. The school that the boys attend coddles its students while pushing fundamentalism. In one scene, Cody's science class discusses reproduction. Cody mumbles that men are now getting pregnant and the teacher responds that God is against it.

What were the filmmakers thinking? Maybe they got a grant or couldn't bear to admit defeat. I can't believe that they followed these guys for three years.

In the end, we managed just 90 minutes of this six-hour dud. I'm not sure what the other reviewers saw. I've never posted a one-star review, but Country Boys earned that dubious distinction.",1281225600,2,1785,5.013513513513513
8100064,1,B000CPHAA6,"This documentary is very convincing to outsiders but terribly inaccurate. The biography of one of the main characters (Cody) is very misleading. The tragic events that occurred in his life (i.e. the murder of his mother) never occurred in the ""country."" These events occurred in Lexington Ky. As a matter of fact during the filming he lived with his upper middle class relatives from the country. While his life is tragic, his association with ""the country"" played no part in it. He was a poor inner-city teen with an alcoholic father.  The other character is from a very poor family who, in no way, represents the typical family in this area. I have intimate knowledge of the locations and people in this film; way too many inaccuracies to write here. I cannot stress enough how inaccurate this film is. Even the director wrote about how he stayed in a ""poor"" local neighborhood while filming this; even placing pictures of this old run down trailer on his website. What he didn't mention was that the old abandoned trailer he found was next to some of the largest mansions in the Eastern United States. One of which that has been featured on Better Homes and Gardens. Don't believe me; but please do your own research before believing this documentary. For me, having a rare opportunity to see 1st hand both sides of this story has made me really examine information put out by the media.",1276732800,3,1390,4.720164609053498
8100065,5,B000CPHAA6,"I was heartened to see the five star average of the reviews here.  Perhaps people who don't care for this type of thing just didn't watch it so weren't around to criticise it.  I love documentaries.  I have to admit, though, that I found this a bit long and draggy in parts. Obviously it's paced for TV and watching it all in one sitting may be overwhelming. I watched it over two evenings.

As others have said, this is a look at the lives of two teenagers in Appalachia over a three year period.  I suppose everyone will have their favorite of the two and of the supporting cast of characters.  Personally I found it hard to warm up to Cody, and was relieved when the camera turned to Chris.  Yet Cody was the class valedictorian and appeared to have some sort of charisma that attracted his classmates to him.  It just didn't come across on film to me.  I did really like his girlfriend's father, Roy, though.  Roy was a handsome charming guy who sang and played guitar like the best of any Country singer I've heard.  He should be a star!

Chris, on the other hand, was the one who won my heart early on.  He was heroic in his struggle between trying to take care of his highly dysfunctional family and getting on with his education. He's the one I'll be thinking about for a long time, wishing him well.

The film maker gives us generous pictures of the supporting characters and some of them come across as heroic, too.  The wonderful principal of David School gets highest grades for her no-nonsense, but extremely compassionate help for Chris.  I teared up, as others did, when she announced her resignation and I had to wonder why....It was great to see her appear again at Chris's graduation.  The quality of caring that the school staff showed for these kids was amazing.  Maybe some of it was staged for the camera, but some of it must have been real.

My only complaint regarding the film making was the staged feeling to so many of the conversation.  We saw many of them, between the one of the boys and: the step-grandmother, the principal, the mother, a teacher,the pastor, etc.  They had a rehearsed quality that seemed artificial and even tedious after a while.  However the boys, themselves seemed perfectly natural for the most part, which is amazing.  Chalk it up to youth.

This is a film that will keep you thinking  for a long time. I add too, that it's refreshing to see something in mainstream media (well, not exactly mainstream) that shows Christianity in a positive light.",1274054400,4,2501,4.541387024608501

David Sutherland ventures into these two boy's lives for three years, three of the most stressful years of their lives: graduating from high school and trying to make a start in the world despite perhaps unpromising circumstances.  There's so much here that can be taken for social and political commentary: the breakdown of the role of the father in the American family, the breakdown of the family itself, rural poverty and trying to get by in America today.  But there's no agenda here, it's about the details, trying to overcome challenges that will arise regardless how hard we work.",1218240000,4,785,4.75

The filmmakers have managed to capture the poignance of life for the economically challenged in Eastern Kentucky, and they have also created something more universal, as there are qualities in Chris and Cody that we can all identify with.  If you're a fan of Elizabeth Barret's documentaries or Gurney Norman's literature you will find yourself in familiar territory here.  Strongly recommended.",1195948800,,556,5.441860465116279
