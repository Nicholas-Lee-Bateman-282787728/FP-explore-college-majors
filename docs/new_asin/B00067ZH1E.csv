8039951,4,B00067ZH1E,Great old shows. I try to find as many from that era I can.,1491523200,,59,3.2857142857142856
8039952,5,B00067ZH1E,"This collection (in decent kinescope quality) is worth it just for the Frank Sinatra-Harold Arlen medley in the first (Cantor) show; as one author put it, ""..a master class in the art of popular singing."" Frank at his Absolute Best. As a stark contrast, listen for Eddie Fisher and the orchestra performing in two different keys in the second song of Fisher's ""hits"" medley (Anytime""), until conductor Al Goodman kills the accompaniment to let Fisher finish acapella! Also features some hilarious improvising by Lou Costello in a sketch with an uncooperative mule.",1462492800,,564,5.141304347826087
8039953,5,B00067ZH1E,"This is so much fun to watch.  Good, clean, old-fashioned humor.  A bit physically slap-stick'ish maybe for some who don't care for those kinds of things, but when you consider the era these were produced in and the culture of that day, this is simply good, clean, family entertainment.  I highly recommend it!",1371772800,,310,4.811320754716981
8039954,5,B00067ZH1E,"Comedy: Classic Black & White: Condition - New/Sealed: REGION FREE - Interactive Menus - Scene Selection -Featuring shows telecast from 1950 to 1955. STARS: Eddie Cantor, Frank Sinatra, Eddie Fisher, Abbott and Costello, Victor Borge. 83 minutes. Digitally Remastered 2005 by Miracle Pictures div. of PMC Corp. Shows of this time period were originally made by aiming a motion picture film camera at a live T.V. monitor of the live show being broadcast (Kinescope) as there were no Video recorders in those days and then these films were remastered to DVD. This DVD takes Public Domain material (entertainment that original copyright date has expired) like all reissue companies from film or video and converts them to DVD for reissue. Unfortunately reissue entertainment companies do not have the $25,000 per frame cost (30 frames per minute) or $100,000 New Cover Mastering costs to to restore old films or video tapes audio & video masters to the modern digital possibilities but do offer us a window on the past and interesting or entertaining subjects like these LIVE TV SHOWS of the 1950's!",1175385600,6,1096,5.094444444444444
8039955,5,B00067ZH1E,"What a joy to see these old television classics.  The quality of the picture is poor, but the sound is excellent.  If you're old enough to remember Eddie Cantor you'll love seeing him again.  The Abbott and Costello program includes a live performance of their classic ""Who's on First.""  We also get a chance to see a young Frank Sinatra singing in his prime.  This DVD is priceless.",1131753600,6,383,4.573529411764706
