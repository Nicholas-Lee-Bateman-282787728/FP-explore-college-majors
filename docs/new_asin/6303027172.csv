7834367,5,6303027172,"This became my favorite aerobics video of all time, and I wore out the VHS tape.  I wish she would put it on DVD.  The steps are a bit complicated to learn at first, but once you get them, it's a good workout, fast-moving and no too long, keeping me interested over many years.  I like the arm workout with the band and the cooldown as well. I have tried the following other aerobics instructors: Jane Fonda, Kathy Smith, Cher, Donna Richardson, Gilad, Callenetics, Denise Austin, The Firm, Ginn Miller and Christi Taylor.  My favorites are this one and Kathy Smith's Power Step.",1216166400,,579,4.592233009708738

7834369,5,6303027172,"Kari Anderson's Bench Works is a fun, challenging thorough work-out. The step segment includes innovative coreography to keep you interested and busy with Kari's great ability to cue well and build difficult moves  together step by step. The resistance/strengthening segment is tough (but  not impossible) and very effective. The ab section works all areas of the  abdominal muscles without wasting time. Emphasis throughout is on good form  and safe technique and includes good warm-up, cool down and stretching. It  will keep you interested for years as you watch your fitness levels  inprove.
