6681091,4,B00NVJ1E4S,"Some of these shorts were created to salvage footage from a scrapped 1930 feature film first called ""The Hollywood Revue of 1930"" and latter re-titled ""The March of Time"" before production stopped.
When one sees these musical numbers performed with bad dancing and jiggling cellulite you will wonder why MGM even started filming these after rehearsals!

The Warner Archive has these in a sequence differing from their original release sequence.
Here is the original release sequence: (My viewing suggestion is at the bottom.)

1933
1) Nertsery Rhymes (July 6) (Color) prod #685 - Shot in 2-color Technicolor, probably because the scrapped musical numbers included here were shot in 2-color Technicolor. Ted invites his girlfriend Bonnie into his children's bedroom to tell them musical nursery rhymes.  At one point the awful Bonny appears to start a dance and thankfully she stops. ""The Woman in the Shoe"" sequence was from Lord Byron of Broadway (1930).

2) Beer and Pretzels (August 26) prod #690 - This comedy about the boys becoming waiters after failing as performers plays the most like their Columbia Comedies.  The musical numbers fit in better with the story line.  Bonnie is such a bad dancer that she is unintentionally funny.

3) Hello Pop! (September 16) (Color) prod #696 - A welcome discovery! This 2-color Technicolor film is more of a comedy about putting on a show rather than using the boys to bridge musical numbers (one number, ""Sailing On A Sunbeam"" from ""Its A Great Life (1929) is tagged on at the very end). Like in Nertsery Rhymes, the boys play children to father Ted Healy.

4) Plane Nuts (October 14) prod #680 - This one feels earlier (the production number indicates it is the second produced), probably because it is recreating what Ted Healy & His Stooges were doing in Vaudeville.  The musical numbers ""Happy Landing"" and ""Dance Until Dawn"" were lifted from the MGM feature film Flying High (1931)

1934
5) Roast Beef and Movies (Feb 10) (Color) prod #701 (c) is 1933 - NOT a Stooge comedy, this is a short subject starring George Givot, along with Curly Howard (billed as ""Jerry Howard""), Bobby Callahan, and the Albertina Rasch Dancers. (The film does not feature Ted Healy or the other Stooges.) The music is by Dmitri Tiomkin, who was married to Rasch at the time.
Notable in this film is Howard being more of a ""middle stooge,"" similar to Larry Fine's character in the Three Stooges films, and using his real voice without the ""Curly"" inflections. Calahan played the ""dumb"" character that Howard would normally play.
The short, filmed in two-strip Technicolor, uses the ""Chinese Ballet"" segment from the MGM movie Children of Pleasure (1930) and ""Raising The Dust"" from Children Of Pleasure (1930).

6) The Big Idea (May 12) prod #628 - is a BIG misnomer as this is the worst of the bunch.  The Stooges are reduced to three brief walk-ons, re-working the same gag over & over again.  You will be hitting the ""Fast Forward"" button to get the the brief Stooge routines.  The radio recreation of an Amos 'N Andy show (not with the original stars) may be unsettling to today's viewers. The musical number with Tut Mace and the MGM Dancing Girls is an outtake from That's the Rhythm of the Day from DANCING LADY (1933), and the Three Radio Rogues' performance was filmed for, but not used in the MGM feature GOING HOLLYWOOD (1933) starring Bing Crosby.

I first saw all of these (except Hello Pop!) at a theatrical revival in the 1980's.  The audience was very unhappy as they were expecting comedies the quality of the early Columbia Shorts.  So if you view this DVD collection expecting that, you will be disappointed.  If you view this as a historical piece  showing off what the Stooges did in Vaudeville with Ted Healy then you will be thoroughly happy with this as I am.

Here is MY suggested viewing order, it is close to what is on the DVD:
1) ROAST BEEF AND MOVIES #701- because it is Curly teamed with other comedians as if he had not joined the Stooges yet.
2) PLANE NUTS #680 - because is shows the Stooges doing their Vaudeville stage routines.
3) NERTSERY RHYMES #685 - because it feels disjointed from the music numbers like Roast Beef does, the Stooges are only bridging material.
4) HELLO POP #696 - because the Stooges continue their performance as children like in Nertsery Rhymes.
5) BEER AND PRETZELS #690 - because it feels the most like the 3 Stooges comedies they would do at Columbia.

Then if you have time to kill:
6) THE BIG IDEA #628 - because there is only a few minutes worth watching.",1418342400,16,4551,4.742712294043092

6681094,5,B00NVJ1E4S,"For the first time The Three Stooges ""Hello Pop!"" Is released on DVD. While all of the other shorts on the disc have been released before, this collection does have the complete version of ""Beer and Pretzels"" which is arguably the best short during the Stooges working with Ted Healy. It's unique watching the Stooges playing off of the lead of Healy, and while not as funny as when they worked on their own, there are still some very funny moments.",1412812800,11,449,4.555555555555555
6681095,4,B00NVJ1E4S,"If you are a Stooges fan you need this DVD to complete your collection of Stooges shorts. But just to let everyone know that while the previous ""Shorts"" collections released by Warner Archive would usually have between 30-50 shorts this set just has the 6 Stooges Shorts made at MGM with Ted Healy. And 5 of those have been released before. So you are really only spending $20 for the one Stooges Short, ""Hello Pop!"" that had been thought to be a ""Lost"" film but was discovered in Australia in 2013. They don't even present the shorts in chronological order. ""Hello Pop"" from 1933 is the last short on the disc while shorts from 1934 are on the disc before it.",1412035200,10,660,4.462809917355372

These are the earliest short films featuring the beloved Stooges. However, the non-film historian must proceed with caution. These are mostly subpar and grossly unfunny films that include the trio's talentless, hammy, and unappealing early mentor Ted Healy from 1933 and 1934 that proceeded the Columbia Curly Classics they are loved for today, who spends most of the proceedings insufferably berating and slapping the Stooges in a manner that lacks the charm of Moe Howard. Had our heroes' film career been limited to NERTSEY RHYMES, THE BIG IDEA, HELLO POP, and ROAST BEEF AND MOVIES, they would have been forgotten footnotes in cinema, or arrested for impersonating comedians.

NERTSERY RHYMES is a humorless extended skit about the stooges as children being told bad bedtime stories by Ted Healy and Bonny, the would be femme fatale of these films  who is down on Healy's level when it comes to talent and charm. ROAST BEEF AND MOVIES raises more question marks than laughs in a strange story of Curly (minus Larry and Moe, Ted Healy isn't here either, but that makes no real difference) with a Greek dialect comic and a lesser third banana as they try to convince a movie producer to support their junk ideas. One would be hard pressed to crack a smile at this tale, or THE BIG IDEA, whose only remotely amusing moment is a segment that may offend some today with other comedians doing an accurate imitation of Amos & Andy.

HELLO POP was lost until recently, and one can see why. Ted Healy is at his most loud, insufferable,, and downright annoying as a bullying producer screaming at everyone in sight. The Stooges play his children dressed in Little Lord Fauntleroy/Buster Brown type outfits, and Bonny's running gag is so poorly acted that it doesn't rate a faint snicker. The best part of this one is an insert of a musical scene from an earlier musical, Irving Berlin's ""Sailing on a Sunbeam,"" which is a rather peppy and appealing number.

Now for the two passably good films in this set. PLANE NUTS is an amusing look at our heroes (alas, with Healy dragging things down somewhat) doing a recreation of their vaudeville act. It is said that this was part of a more elaborate story of our heroes flying around the world backwards to win a bet. That now-lost footage would have been interesting, but as it is, its a good look at what their live stage show was like. Some interesting pre-code sexual gags. In the words of Larry Fine, HEY! HEY!

BEER AND PRETZELS is the best of the bunch. Healy and our heroes are out of luck vaudevillians (thanks to Healy's fooling around with showgirls) who find a job as waiters. Bonny does a horrific song and dance early on, but the rest of the film puts our heroes out front clowning as they do best.

So on the whole, if you have to have everything the Stooges made, along with the Shemp Howard, Joe Besser, and Curly Joe DeRita abominations, then this is for you. Casual Stooge fans of the Curly Columbia Classics will avoid this like the plague. However, if you ever want to chase away a houseful of annoying and unwanted guests, put on this DVD. It will do the trick and clear them out.",1480636800,,3304,4.6279863481228665

8680438,4,B00NVJ1E4S,"Great early efforts by the Stooges. In color no less. Most of their classic mannerisms are starting to take shape. There timing is flawless at this early stage in their career....As for the picture, absolutely nothing has been done by way of restoration in any way shape or form. Which is a crying shame. The Stooges, and the fans, deserve much better. In some places the film and sound actually skips...It's twice as sad that with todays technological advances these shorts should remain in such terrible condition. It seems that still, some 80 years later, the powers that be don't give the trio the respect they richly deserve.  So Five stars for Curly, Larry, and Moe. And no stars for Warner bros.",1429833600,3,702,4.754098360655738
