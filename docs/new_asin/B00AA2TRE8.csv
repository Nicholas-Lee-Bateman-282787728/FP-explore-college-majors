8548887,1,B00AA2TRE8,"Someone showed a clip of this movie on Face Book, and since ""Leverage"", I'm a fan of Gina Bellman, so I wanted to order it. Since I am hearing impaired, I could not make out what they were saying in English, so I wanted to order the show from Amazon, but then I saw, Audio: English and Sub-titles: Spanish.  In behalf of the 20% to 30% (it keeps rising) of the population who are hearing impaired, I must ask, why not have closed captions on ALL films in which they speak English?",1403827200,,480,4.217391304347826
