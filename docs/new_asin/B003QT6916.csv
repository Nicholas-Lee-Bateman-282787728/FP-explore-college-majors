4171876,5,B003QT6916,This was one of my favorite Saturday morning tv shows so of course I love my dvd set; I just wish they'd release the rest of the seasons for us to buy as well.,1382572800,,159,3.7058823529411766
4171877,5,B003QT6916,"Received the item (DVD) as promised, thank you.  I would gladly do future business any time.  Enjoyed watching this version of Robin Hood.",1382486400,,138,4.956521739130435
4171878,4,B003QT6916,"This was a really fun DVD.  I've been waiting a long time for this to come out and am anxious for Season 2.  The characters have great charisma and really play well off one another.  I particularly like the chemistry between the actors playing Robin and Marian in Season 1.  There is just enough sexual tension to let you know they have a thing for each other, but not so much that it takes away the intrigue of trying to find out when they are finally going to give in to their feelings.  There's plenty of action and interesting story lines too.  Please don't drag out the release of Season 2.  It's been way too long already.",1371081600,,628,4.316239316239316
4171879,4,B003QT6916,"If you like stories and movies of this sort, you'll probably enjoy this dvd set.

I'm now waiting for season 2 of this.

It showed on local TV here in  the early to mid 90s, I believe.

It stars Matthew Porretta, who was in Robin Hood Men in Tights, a hilarious movie... he was Will Scarlett O'hara... from Georgia.  [that edited line makes sense if you've seen the movie.]

Enjoy!",1357430400,,381,4.371428571428571
4171880,5,B003QT6916,"I remembering watching this show early Saturday morning when I started college back in 1997.  The chemistry between the characters was great (I prefered Anna Galvin as Marion - she seemed feistier than Barbara Griffin), Little John was the ""gentle giant"" and Friar Tuck always seemed to be eating!  Of course, Matthew Porreta as the eponymous Robin Hood nailed the part perfectly.  There are no special features on this DVD set but that's OK since you come to relive the adventures.  I hope that the powers-to-be will release Season 2 soon.",1316649600,,540,4.9010989010989015
4171881,3,B003QT6916,"With the release of Ridley's Scott's latest big screen version of Robin Hood, every previous film and TV version has been getting a new lease on life as studios try to strike while the iron is still hot.  One of those TV versions is ""The New Adventures of Robin Hood"" which ran for a total of 52 episodes in 1997 - 1998 on the TNT network.  It was inspired by shows such as ""Hercules: The Legendary Journeys"" and ""Xena Warrior Princess"" that were less concerned with realism and more concerned with action and campy humor.  The first season consists of 13 episodes in all.

The cast is a light version of Robin Hood and his Merry Men consisting of Robin (Matthew Poretta), Lady Marion (Anna Galvin), Little John (Richard Ashton), and Friar Tuck (Martyn Ellis).  The series begins with little in the way of setup or introduction to the characters in the episode titled ""Rage of the Mongols"".  In what is a recurring plot throughout the series, Robin and his comrades come to the aid of a small village, this time from band of raiding Mongols.  Never mind that the Mongols are a little out of the territory, Genghis Khan's empire extended only into the far eastern part of Europe.  Historical accuracy is not one of the show's strong points.  The opening episode is heavily influenced (read ripped off) of the western film ""The Magnificent Seven"" as the heroes teach the villagers to defend themselves from the bandits.

In Episode two we have another village but essentially the same plot as this time Robin and the gang have to help a village besieged by Viking raiders in ""Attack of the Vikings"".  This episode introduces us to Robin's arch-nemesis Prince John as the pair are captured and held for ransom by the Vikings.

""Robin and the Golden Arrow"" is one of the best episodes of season one, primarily due to the presence of legendary actor, Christopher Lee.  Prince John employs a knight who wears magical armor that makes him invulnerable.  The knight has kidnapped Friar Tuck and Little John's sister.  Lee plays a wizard who sends Robin on a quest to find a golden arrow, the only weapon capable of piercing the armor.

Another solid outing is ""A Price for His Soul"".  A monster is stalking the people of yet another generic village, killing them and drinking their blood.  The monster is a sorcerer who needs the blood to regain his youth.  His demonic lord tells him he can permanently restore his youth by taking the life force of a man pure of heart...Robin Hood!

The New Adventures of Robin Hood was rock bottom in terms of budget and because of this it simply could not compare to shows like Hercules and Xena.  The acting of most of the non-main cast members was woefully amateurish but that could be largely attributed to the terrible dialog.  The fighting scenes were often laughable and poorly choreographed.  The props such as the swords and other weapons looked like they were made out of plastic or wood.

Poretta was dashing and charismatic as Robin and easily the best part of the cast.  He was an athletic guy who looked comfortable in the role.  Anna Galvin cut a strikingly beautiful and buxom figure as Lady Marion and did an admirable job in her action scenes.  Regrettably she left the show after the first season.  With his long hair and lean frame, Richard Ashton seemed like he would be more at home in a Whitesnake video than playing the rugged Little John, however.

Given the cheap budgets and lack of talented supporting actors, The New Adventures of Robin Hood made the best out of what they had to work with.  It may not have always been good, but it wasn't dull.",1286841600,9,3602,4.635646687697161
4171882,3,B003QT6916,"The series were good but without being able to get the rest it remains incomplete.
Have a slight problem concerning the colour, as it keeps going black and white, have no idea what is causing it?",1285459200,3,195,4.444444444444445
4171883,4,B003QT6916,I LOVED this show when it was on the air for the first two seasons (with Matthew Porretta) as Robin Hood. Of course I was in my teens then and had yet to inundate myself with all things production-wise. Watching it now that I'm older... apart from some dialogue and design things most likely due to the budget they had... I STILL LOVE IT!! I love the fantasy elements and some of the cheesiness. The show never promised anything more than roughly 45 minutes entertainment (rest of time for commercials) and family fun when it was on. It is like 'Hercules: The Legendary Journeys' in that respect. And watching both shows now with the education I've had... I still love them for what they are. I just hope the decision is made to release the second season! There was--what I recall to be--an awesome episode with Montel Williams as a guest star!,1282262400,5,844,4.559210526315789
4171884,4,B003QT6916,"First off, the cover of this DVD is actually from the second season, not the first. I must add that the second season was far superior to the first, and I really hope Warner Brothers will follow the first season closely with the second.

This series is one of a long line of movies and TV series based on the legendary outlaw who robbed from the rich and gave to the poor, and that famous characteristic is demonstrated in this series.  In this version, the very athletic Matthrew Porretta takes the role of the title character.  Richard Ashton is convincing as Little John, Anna Galvin is the surprisingly short-skirted Marion, and Martyn Ellis is the lovable Friar Tuck.  Also present is Andrew Bicknell as the evil Prince John, Christopher Lee in a recurring role as the mystical Olwyn, and Greg Porretta (Matthrew's brother) also in a recurring role as Sir Guy of Gisborne, Robin's rival for Marion's affection.

That said, the writing doesn't quite live up to the talent of this excellent cast. I really hate to admit it, since I count this series one of my favorites, but there are some episodes that come pretty close to being silly. On the other hand, most of the episodes are simply fun and interesting, a new take on an old story.  One excellent episode deals with how young Robert of Locksley took the name of Robin Hood and went to live in the forest.  Be on the lookout for Matthew Porretta's backflips and handsprings.  The man's talent is not limited to his acting ability!

In my opinion, the talented and likeable cast manage to pull this series up enough to make it worth seeing, enough that I can overlook some questionable script writing.  In a word, Porretta IS Robin Hood in this series.",1277510400,14,1709,4.629139072847682
8402517,5,B003QT6916,I ordered the DVD for one of my best friends as this was a series she watched during her teens. And she is hooked again. She is playing the dvds over and over again. She can't wait till season 2 will be released.,1517443200,,212,3.953488372093023

8402520,5,B003QT6916,"I've enjoyed most versions of Robin Hood, especially the Errol Flynn, Disney live action with Richard Todd and the Richard Greene TV series.  While not as good as those, this series was a different take on Robin Hood created in the footsteps of the Hercules and Xena shows.  I did enjoy it even though they recast Maid Marian after season 1 and Robin Hood after season 2!  So it was nice to add it to my DVD collection so I could watch it again.  Now if only they'd follow it up with series 2-4!  And having Christopher Lee as a magician was an added bonus!",1504569600,,557,4.266666666666667

8402522,5,B003QT6916,"I loved these episodes when they first aired and wasn't sure I would enjoy them again as an adult but they are so much fun! Robin Hood has always been a great love of mine and I have watched it every chance I get and this one is still one of my favorites. Really wish they would release Season's 2, 3 & 4 now! Amazon does need to pack this item better as when mine arrived some of the discs were being moved around from the case being broken in transport. 2 of the DVD's do not fit properly in the case now. Highly recommend this show to anyone who loves Robin Hood and enjoys some fantasy and magic.",1436400000,,600,4.050420168067227
