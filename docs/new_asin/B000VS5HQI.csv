2953634,5,B000VS5HQI,I am very pleased with my purchase. I would not hesitate to make more purchases.,1284422400,2,80,4.4
2953635,5,B000VS5HQI,"This is a wonderful movie based on an even better book by the legendary Craig Rice. Those of us of a certain age are very familiar with it; it was regularly shown on New York's WNEW-TV, Channel 5, back in the 60s, when I was a kid. The book is geared toward an adult reader, but the movie adaption is meant to be enjoyed by audiences of all ages. I have repeatedly requested the Fox Movie Channel to air it, to no avail. I have a VHS copy, the one that comes in the box pictured. Certainly not a great print, for a purist like myself, but definitely watchable. I was surprised to read a customer review discussing this movie as if TCM retains the rights, because that's certainly not the case. Turner owns the rights to NO 20th Century Fox releases! There's a very bizarre mistaken notion floating around that TCM owns the rights to all the classics; how silly.",1257292800,5,861,4.354037267080745
2953636,5,B000VS5HQI,"The kind of movie a whole family can enjoy.  No blood and guts or psychological mumbo jumbo.  I love these types of movies, my father and I used to watch them.  We also collected Charlie Chan movies.",1256169600,5,199,4.324324324324325
2953637,4,B000VS5HQI,"If you're a fan of the good old movies for kids when ""you"" were a kid, then you'll enjoy this movie.  The print is the best I can find and the movie is great fun.

This is an update from my original review and I'm wondering why Fox doesn't release a version of this movie on their newer Archive Films.  When I wrote this review in
2009 the film was released by an outfit that now is charging over one hundred dollars for the film.  It's not that good a print and certainly not worth that kind of money.  If Fox can finally release ""The Late George Apley"", I'd think they could make a print of this film for all of us that remember it so fondly.  When I wrote my first review of this, there were virtually no comments on the movie.  Now, there are a lot more and it's a film that is really remembered and enjoyed.  I'll keep on trying and maybe there will be a ground swell of interest.  I hope so--it's worth it.  Thanks.  Judy B.",1244678400,20,930,4.082872928176796

2953639,5,B000VS5HQI,"Thanks so much Randolph Scott, I appreciate its quick arrival and it made my day. I had looked for that film most of my lifetime. I always loved this film with Dean Stockwell. I always trust Amazon's sellers and the Amazon organization.",1379548800,,236,4.642857142857143

2953641,4,B000VS5HQI,"Saw this movie quite a while back when I was in my 20's (I'm in my EARLY 60's now) and always tried to find it after. A great old mystery movie with some pretty good stars. My favorite child actor, Peggy Ann Garner and also Dean Stockwell as her younger brother. Three very savvy kids try to solve the mystery murder which took place in their neighborhood. If you like to feel like your back of your own childhood when TV and Radio were great, this is a good movie to start with. Brought back lots of memories!",1373414400,,510,4.214285714285714
2953642,2,B000VS5HQI,"This film has got to come down in price. $124.95 No movie is worth that kind of a price. I have been waiting for years for this film to come out on DVD and I don't think this is nothing more than a home made copy like the VHS version was. That's right, I don't think this wonderful film has legally come out on DVD or VHS.If anybody knows better, please let me know. Why don't some real studio release this fine family mystery film. It is really one of those old classics that as slipped thru the cracks. It should be discovered again.
There is another great obscure film that should be discovered again ""Lady In The Dark"". It was Ginger Rogers' one great musicals without Fred Astaire. You can see snatches of it o utube and their beautiful. Especially Gingers ""Saga of Jenny"" number. I don't believe this film was ever released on VHS even.

2953643,4,B000VS5HQI,"The movie is excellent. The VHS tape is fair, but well worth purchasing to see this fine old film. Remembered it from my youth and it was wonderful to revisit the story.",1350086400,,169,4.3125
2953644,4,B000VS5HQI,"When I purchased this film, I realized that it was very old. However when I received it, it was not of the best quality. I contacted the seller and they went out of their way to contact their supplier to see if they could get a better version of this film. They also contacted another supplier and purchased a film from them to see if their film was of a better quality. They sent both versions to me (reviewing them both before sending them to me and giving me their opinion as to their quality) so that I could determine whether I wanted to exchange one of them for my original purchase.  I reviewed the two new versions and determined that one of them was of the quality that was acceptable.  I want to let the sellers know how much I appreciate their going out of their way to accommodate me. They also indicated that they were going to change suppliers so that this did not happen again.  I would not hesitate to do business with them again. They represent what customers need (which we somehow don't receive too often) and that is a company that represents responsibility and cooperation. Thanx again!",1334102400,2,1107,4.47029702970297

Many of my fellow Baby Boomers also love this movie, which we grew up watching on WNEW-TV Channel 5 in Metro New York. It's outrageous that these third-party sellers are offering what I'm sure are bootleg copies for exorbitant prices. Years ago I bought a bootleg VHS copy of it, and the quality is appalling. My advice is to wait until Fox decides to release it in its movies-on-demand series.",1449273600,,486,4.47191011235955

8220165,5,B000VS5HQI,This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  The sweet innocence of the children is so refreshing.  Just a sweet little mystery with love as the underlying theme.,1418774400,,165,4.466666666666667
