2833178,5,B000NJM2FO,"Season 6 episodes:
""Fade in to Murder"" (with William Shatner)
""Old Fashioned Murder"" (with Joyce Van Patten---great to do about ""one gold belt buckle"")
""The Bye-Bye Sky High IQ Murder Case"" (with Theodore Bikel)

Season 7 episodes:
""Try and Catch Me""
(with a wonderful performance by Ruth Gordon as Abigail Mitchell:
I'm beginning to be very fond of you, Lieutenant. I think you're a very nice man.
Lt. Columbo: Don't count on that. Miss Mitchell. Don't count on it.)

""Murder Under Glass"" (with Louis Jourdan)

""Make Me a Perfect Murder""
(with Trish Van Devere as a TV executive willing to do anything to get to the top. Also with Patrick O'Neal)
""How to Dial a Murder"" (with Nicol Williamson and his trained doberman pinchers)

""The Conspirators""
(One of the best episodes with Clive Rivell as a supporter of the IRA trying to get guns to Ireland and has Columbo drinking Irish whiskey down to ""This line and no further!"")

The standouts here are ""Make Me a Perfect Murder"" (a fine mystery and a great behind the scenes look at film production), the ending wrap-up of an ""Old Fashioned Murder"" and ""The Conspirators"" and ""Try and Catch me,"" 2 of the best acted Columbo episodes.",1391472000,12,1180,4.764705882352941

2833191,5,B000NJM2FO,"Simply the best detective series ever! Even though Columbo's formula remains the same throughout his entire career, it is Peter Falk's personality and character that always make me want to see how he will handle the next murder suspect.",1482278400,6,236,5.076923076923077
2833192,3,B000NJM2FO,Glad it's the last two seasons because we're getting tired of Columbo.  Good they ended it at the seventh season because it becomes to redundant after too many episodes.,1481155200,,169,4.827586206896552
