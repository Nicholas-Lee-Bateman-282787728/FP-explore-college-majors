3666642,5,B001KN3MTC,"I confess to watching zombie films, and that sort of thing - some sometimes I do like GOOD Christian movies about the End Times...and this is good, its a docudrama, not just a dry documentary, (but there are lots of Bible facts in it for the Christian viewer). ...  I think it was made for giving to folks who are not believers, because it is kinda convincing....perhaps I'll think about it... :)

anyway, if you like end of the world movies, you'll enjoy this one too!",1239753600,,469,4.441860465116279
3666643,5,B001KN3MTC,"This is a must see for every member of the human race, no matter what their beliefs!  A major production docudrama - applying the Bible and current events into a powerful compelling presentation in modern language.

Watch it, and pass it on!  Praise the Lord!",1237939200,,259,4.711111111111111

With so many fundamentalist sectarian religions out there and more popping up every day, every different one has their view of the end of the world while condemning the other for their beliefs, as well as societies of people that are better, but it is true that so many people who don't believe and aren't of Native American backgrounds or know the right way, are continuing to destroy mother earth! This movie does help in telling and proving that there is so much 'hate' and 'greed' out there in society today, while it's also telling the truth of its destruction! I look around and cringe at how cities are growing while covering the land with concrete, and killing trees like Pines that take many years to grow and are another source of the air that we breathe, with some of them doing it in the name of 'greed'! Also with all the wars and constant fighting amongst religions for total control is another addition to destroying mother earth! I could go on, but its so sad to see how ruined our planet is becoming, while 'greed, self-servitude, and hate' is taking over to the point that many other people that do care, are looking for other means of 'living' and 'sharing' while leaving society as a whole knowing they're no longer a part of it! If noting else, this movie gives a lot of insight for those who are turning their backs on the reality of life, their brethren, and our planet - mother earth!",1233360000,5,1561,4.980842911877395
3666645,5,B001KN3MTC,"As an agnostic, I have read many religious texts such as the Bible, the Koran, and the Torah. All three books have tales and prophesies about Armageddon and the end of days.'  I am pretty firm in my convictions but this DVD; ""The Final Events"" really made me stop and think. Presented in a news story type format, you can feel the fear as reporters talk about present day disasters and report on disasters that are to come on the path to Armageddon.  Director John Drakes presents today's events that are pulled directly from the Bible and demonstrates the power of God in a way that  can change the mind of any person who has doubts about their creator and how the world will end.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dark-Side-of-Colorado-Murder-Mayhem-and-Massacre/dp/1440466319/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dark Side of Colorado: Murder, Mayhem, and Massacre</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Jack-Russell-Terrier-Canine-Companion-or-Demon-Dog/dp/1434848906/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Jack Russell Terrier Canine Companion or Demon Dog</a>",1232841600,12,1128,6.659863945578231
3666646,5,B001KN3MTC,"I have never had events, such as, explained in this manner.  It was crisp, clear, devestating and inspirational.  Thank you!",1232323200,11,124,5.15
3666647,5,B001KN3MTC,"WOW!  I just watched this DVD and I'm excited about these `Final Events' - I Can't WAIT!!!  As good as this DVD is, the even greater thing is that even non-believers will have a hard time explaining away all the facts presented!  Plus, I really liked the `CNN like' news reports.  But one of the best things about this DVD on the End Times, is the fact that it does not promote any Preacher, it's only about the End of Days, Daniel and Revelation.  There is no promotion of any Church, mailing list, request for donations, etc, so you can use it for your Church, group, or pass it to anyone knowing there is no pitch for money at the end.  Money is important, but sometimes requests for donations never seem to end and I get embarrassed to loan items that include it!  Get a copy of this and pass it around - it's getting right down to the `End Times'!!!",1231804800,,854,4.267080745341615
3666648,5,B001KN3MTC,"Well, this is a nice little piece of Christian propaganda!  If I was not a VERY confirmed non-believer I might actually be persuaded that the `end was near'!  I only ordered and watched this because I like `end of the world' fiction, and sometimes I delve into Christian Armageddon material, (a guilty pleasure of mine was the Left Behind series of DVDs)...so with that in mind I ordered this, and was impressed with it, it's more to the point than a lot of this sort of thing, and it's not all `nice-nice' Christian syrup - its hard line and edgy, (but of course it ends with god winning).  Anyway, if you like docudramas and a good story, good propaganda, you'll like this even if you don't believe in the `invisible friend' - so you see all you Christians out there: Atheists' are honest and NOT all going to lie - sure this is a good film so 5/5 for the content and presentation - but still, I'm clinging to NO life after death.",1231804800,,932,4.375722543352601
3666649,5,B001KN3MTC,"I just received and watched this DVD.  First, I can say it really did live up to its claims, well, it lived up more than its claims!  I guess some people are just non-believers and want to attack Christian videos that could do some of God's work...well... anyway, it was very good  It used the Bible well to put today's events into perspective, I even learned more than I expected.  This was made for the 'Art Bell' and 'Coast to Coast' generation - who need these sort of docu-dramas to explain God's plan.  News reports, actual clips, Bible passages, it was all very good, and it will do some good in today's world.  My recommendation:  Get it, and pass it on!",1231804800,,662,4.421487603305785
3666650,1,B001KN3MTC,I expected much more content and up to date information on this subject. The advertisement of this dvd was somewhat misleading. I would not encourage the more progressive mind purchase this dvd. Don't waste your money!!,1231200000,,219,5.111111111111111
3666651,5,B001KN3MTC,"this scared me more than anything I've ever seen alone these lines, and I'm a Christian - I really liked the News reports....very believable ...this will convince any non-believer",1227398400,,179,5.206896551724138
8315458,5,B001KN3MTC,"This is a must see for all people - for all people in the world!

First, it tells the truth, and it shows clearly we are in the end times, the final events, the end of days....this is number one.

Second, it tells this very important message in a way that is perfect for views of today, it matches Bible language with current events in a way I have never seen before.

Do not heritage, you will enjoy this - even thought its a Bible message its also very entertaining.

I give it 100% full marks!",1261267200,,496,4.135416666666667
8315459,5,B001KN3MTC,"Wow!  This is sort of a Christian movie about the end of the world, Satan coming...the final fight....lots of things I had been taught in Sunday school but forgot, it is chilling and very sad and uplifting in a strange way.

Its very real and well presented.",1255392000,,258,4.468085106382978
8315460,5,B001KN3MTC,"Powerful DVD showing the prophecy of our Bible directly linked to the events of the recent years, right down to the weather!

Christians will cheer, and find this a 'preaching to the converted' but for us its still a great show to watch: the greatest show on earth!

However, for the non-Christians, this is a powerful weapon to zero in on issues they can not refute: its here in black and white!

What makes it even more exciting is watching the 'false Christ' winning over followers, until the 'Final Events'.

Great use of 'news' like TV and radio reports to make it feel real and very scary!

Loved it!",1255392000,,606,4.522935779816514
8315461,5,B001KN3MTC,"It's encouraging to know there is warnings of the events of the end time. There's diffently going to be an end really soon! It behooves anyone and everyone to be ready for the return of our Lord Jesus. It's a wonder how such realistic movies can be made of the end times. And to what is going to really happen! This DVD is highly reccomended!
Very inspirational!

8315462,5,B001KN3MTC,"I know that there is a fight to stop books, DVD's etc like this, but we know who is behind that - on the other hand we have to use what we can to learn and to show the truth to others.

This DVD will help you show others the truth behind todays TV news headlines and what you read in the newspaper.

I have had a few groups over to my apartment to watch this DVD and many are buying it to show others.  This is a powerful drama of what is happening and will happen - too soon!

Great production too!",1248393600,4,499,3.8155339805825244
8315463,5,B001KN3MTC,"This film will make you stop and think, regardless of your previously held opinions. The Final Events definitely challenged me---I hadn't really given it much of a thought beforehand. But watching these prophesied events gave me pause. It is a serious production and should be widely viewed.",1243036800,11,291,5.212765957446808

8315465,5,B001KN3MTC,"Powerful Christian docudrama on the End of Days, showing the 'Final Events' as per Bible prophecy.  I know this is correct as far as the Bible says, and the DVD brought the message home very strongly, (and powerfully), but I am still undecided... this DVD did NEARLY put me over to the side of being a 100% believer.  I must watch it again, which is a good recommendation for the DVD.",1240444800,,384,4.394366197183099
8315466,5,B001KN3MTC,"Great Prophecy and Great entertainment!  I love the mix of real Bible Prophecy and the CNN news reports.  Clearly the End Times are upon us....and there are many sent to deceived, even some on these very pages...but this presentation should be seen by all who still wonder and need to know.

Great DVD!  Bless you!",1240272000,,314,4.654545454545454
8315467,1,B001KN3MTC,While this DVD tries to use the Bible as it's source it is not correct in it's timeline. It's based on the rapture being at the end of the tribulation period and that during the 1000 year reign of Christ all belivers will be in Heaven and nothing but demons will be on the earth. These are just two of the many doctrines I disagree with but there are many more. I would not waste my money on this DVD nor would I use it for evangelism. If you believe in the literal interpretation of the Sciptures then this DVD is not for you!! Unfortunately I'm out $19.95 and just trashed the DVD.,1239840000,7,583,4.168141592920354
