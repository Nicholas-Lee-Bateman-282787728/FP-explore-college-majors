8211324,5,B000TXQHQE,It s very difficult to find Errol Garner's DVDs. As far as I know only three have been released. The DVD quality is good and his performances were outstanding as usual . Unforgettable concerts...I wish I have been there. To summarize if you like Errol Garner's music you should buy it!!!,1264896000,2,287,4.647058823529412
8211325,1,B000TXQHQE,These same performances appear on YouTube and are in color with very good sound. This DVD is a disgrace and should be avoided.  Don't waste your money. There was a similar review which Amazon took down (shame on them).  I didn't believe it and ordered it anyway. The other reviewer was right. The good thing is that the original material still exists and lets hope it is released in its original full color with great sound condition. I gave it one star but it really should get minus 5 stars!!,1262995200,5,494,4.477777777777778
