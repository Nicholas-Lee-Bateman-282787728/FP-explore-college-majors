2822953,3,B000PHVY7G,"Even though Jeff Gordon is my favorite driver, I found this to be too overindulgent. Oh, he's such a great guy, so wonderful...blah, blah, blah. Enough already. I get it. He's great. Now get lost, and follow Jeff around like you're supposed to! How much filler did they need anyway? How many times did they have to have such celebs as Wayne Gretzky, Troy Aikman, Jay Leno, Pat Riley, Mario Andretti, Tony Hawk and  Charles Barkley talk to the camera about how fantastic Jeff is? Only Kelly Ripa's brief comments didn't seem to be overkill. Once with each of these people would be enough, instead we're forced to hear from them several times throughout this 80 minute, widescreen, feature (2 minutes are end credits). Plus why is it in mono (LPCM)? Only the ugly menu screens are in stereo. Also, so many of the outdoor scenes are badly lit and look like they were filmed in a cave--talk about low budget.

There's not much narration in this Dvd. It's mostly just Jeff and others talking, which is fine. The announcer sounds like the guy that did the ""NASCAR Beyond the Wheel"" shows on the Speed channel. In addition, Patrick Dempsey (""Grey's Anatomy"") does a credible job of asking Jeff the typical softball questions that Larry King might ask, and we learn that Jeff likes to watch ""The Price is Right"". Throughout the feature, we even get to hear from Jeff's new wife, Ingrid, as well as his teammate, Jimmie Johnson and some of Jeff's crew chiefs.

Some of the things I enjoyed from the main feature, that elevated it to 3 stars, instead of just 2 or 2.5 stars were the following: the brief clip from the NASCAR Awards Banquet Dinner, where Jeff  toasts Dale Earnhardt Sr. with a glass of milk; some funny clips from his appearances on ""Saturday Night Live"" and some footage from ""Live with Regis and Kelly"" (where he's co-hosting with Kelly). In addition, I liked some of the fan interviews. One guy jokingly thought that Jeff wasn't redneck enough because he ""annunciated"" his words too well. As well, the husband (a Dale Earnhardt Jr. fan) of one married couple, (whose wife is a Jeff  Gordon fan), would intentionally fly the Gordon 24 car flag, upside down, below his right-side up, Earnhardt Jr. one. His wife points it out and the husband admits to her that it's never done by accident.

Following Jeff Gordon around turned out to be a mostly dull affair. He went fishing, cage-diving with sharks (unfortunately nobody was eaten alive), did a photo shoot, signed stuff for fans and visited his newly built, Jeff Gordon's Children's Hospital with his wife. That part was actually quite touching.

Yes, there was some actual racing footage in this feature, but it was all too brief to be of much value. Still, it was better than nothing and at least there was also some of Jeff's childhood racing footage included as well.

DVD SPECIAL FEATURES (19.5 minutes-all in widescreen):

Three Deleted scenes (15 min.): Featuring two meet-and-greets, and a look at his new Nicorette (green) car.

Outtakes (4.5 min.): Virtually useless, except for Kelly Ripa's funny answers to the following questions:

1) Who would she save if a boat containing Jeff Gordon and her agent capsized ?

2) Where will Jeff Gordon be in 5-10 years?

So, if you're a Jeff Gordon fan like myself, it's worth a rental. If you can't find it for rent, it's cheap enough to buy anyway. If you're curious about Kelly's Ripa's answers to the above questions, then I'll list them BACKWARDS (so as not to spoil them for buyers), below.

2822954,5,B000PHVY7G,"For anyone who wants to know what a nascar driver's life is like when they're not racing, this is the DVD.... even if you're not a Gordon fan. We only see what goes on Sunday and there is a lot more to this Man's life. The program is well shot and offers a fresh insight to one of the sports' most competitive drivers.",1191628800,,318,4.063492063492063
2822955,2,B000PHVY7G,"A big fan of NASCAR I looked forward to this take on the behind the scenes of Jeff Gordon documentary. The DVD was fairly good, but seemed a little dry and slow in its delivery. As expected there are a lot of wonderful comments made about Jeff and his successes but it is taken a little too far and becomes repetitious.  I think this DVD actually is somewhat of an injustice to Jeff and his accomplishments based simply on the way the thing is put together and delivered. Whether you're a Gordon fan or not, there is really nothing on this DVD that you don't already know or have seen. I would save your money until a better documentary comes out.

The 2 star rating is based entirely on the way this thing is produced and not on Jeff Gordon himself who as I mentioned is much more deserving than what this DVD delivers.",1187827200,,820,4.318181818181818
2822956,5,B000PHVY7G,Loved the video and really enjoyed it.  Had a lot more on than what was on the TV program.,1187827200,,90,3.736842105263158
2822957,5,B000PHVY7G,I loved the dve about Jeff Gordon. I loved hearing stuff about what he does on his days off. Also about his life growing up.,1186012800,,124,4.0
2822958,3,B000PHVY7G,"I happen to be a big Jeff fan, and have been
since he started. This video is good for the
fact that it shares a little of his day to day
activities, and some personal downtime, and a
little about his business.
As far as racing moments, could have been a lot
better. Like the title says it is kinda' 24 hours
with Jeff, although I didn't come away sure that
most of it was filmed in ONE 24hr period.
If you want his career highlights and a lot of
racing action, this is probably not going to
satisy you. I'm sure the best of that is yet to
come.
Picture quality is subpar, I thought the lighting
and look was a little on the dark side.
I still liked it, but probably not his best DVD.",1184371200,4,683,3.9927007299270074
2822959,5,B000PHVY7G,"From what I am reading, and what I am hearing inside the industry, this documentary will provide unparalleled access to Jeff.  As I understand it, Jeff allowed the camera crews to follow him just about everywhere - into the team hauler for pre-race pep talks, inside the compound at Hendrick Motorsports, aboard his private jet, into business meetings with his sponors and on and on.  This is a unique chance for all of us fans to get to know the real Jeff, both on and off the track.

The show is narrated by Patrick Dempsey, and contains a host of celebrity interviews ranging from Rick Hendrick and Ray Evernham to Jay Leno and Wayne Gretzy.  This is really cool!

The TV version will air on TNT right before the Pepsi 400 on July 7th.  But, the DVD version contains a lot more footage.

Gordon fans will love this.",1182384000,18,818,4.486486486486487

I wish it had been longer and showed a little more of his home, cars, lifestyle.  But I enjoyed watching him go through his days of running his business.  The best thing about this DVD is watching Jeff climb into that #24....he is the best.",1196294400,,341,4.28125
