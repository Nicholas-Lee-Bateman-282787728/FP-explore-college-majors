8051451,5,B0007TKOUU,John McCarthy is an awesome teacher. He goes over the material then plays it and then spices it up for you.  Just wish I lived in the same city so I could take lessons from him in person.,1383264000,,187,3.9210526315789473
8051452,3,B0007TKOUU,"its ok for beginners i did pick up a few tricks, guess i need to try 3 for more advanced lessons if they have  a 3rd. good for beginners for sure.",1378857600,,146,3.7096774193548385
8051453,2,B0007TKOUU,This method is not very well organized and is not something a person trying to learn the blues with something that can help them grow along the way. There are a few things of use but not much for the price. The flashy dvd guitar playing is over done and not necessary. People buy this stuff so that they can learn and not something to watch someone else show them how good they are after years of playing.  I would not recommend this to anyone but would advise them to look for something with better instruction and not just bits and pieces. Try something with a book/cd like the book by John Ganapes...Blues You Can Use.  It is put together as a real teaching method.,1245542400,13,668,4.336
8051454,5,B0007TKOUU,"My husband is liking the Level 1 Blues guitar lessons so much that I've ordered the Level 2. He hasn't started it yet, but if it's as understandable as the level 1 then he'll be happy.",1210204800,,184,4.138888888888889
8051455,2,B0007TKOUU,"Not very good at getting one to where they think this book will take them.  Not very well organized. It is just another showcase for the artists that produced it... keep looking.  It's presentation suggest it's all about them, not the wanna bee blues player. Not a quality item.  I know, I have reviewed more than 40 such learning books in blues guitar.  This one is not as effective as it should be.",1205366400,4,400,4.438356164383562
8051456,5,B0007TKOUU,"I started out with Learn to play the blues (Guitar) Level 1, by John McCarthy, & because of the excellent instruction methods used, with the follow along DVD, & the comparible booklet that came with the package, I decided to go ahead & purchase the Level 2 package. As yet I'm still on Level 1, which is really for beginner, blues , guitar players, but as I'm making good progress with the backing tracks, which can be dowloaded free from the membership access included in this package, I decided to buy the Level 2 as well. It is in my opinion, the best instruction method around, which normally cost 5 times as much. You will not regret this purchase.",1201392000,4,653,4.495798319327731
8051457,5,B0007TKOUU,This teacher is the best you'll find on DVD buy this and buy all the house of blues instructional DVDs,1193875200,,102,4.15
