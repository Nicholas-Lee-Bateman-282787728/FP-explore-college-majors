894585,5,6304501684,"This cinematic look into nature takes us into the much smaller, slower world of the ""Microcosmos"". I have never before seen such beautiful, almost majestically captured sound and video. This movie takes you into the world of the tiny, little worlds of the insects and the other small organisms that co-exist with us on earth. No other nature documentary has spent this much hard work, time, and money to design and produce the most complex macro lenses and proprietary microphones needed to truly capture the world of the insect. The sheer beauty and sometimes bizarre world of the Microcosmos transforms us into children again as we focus completely on this once in a lifetime chance to leave your world, and enter the smaller universe, amazed at everything your eyes can take in.",1494633600,,781,4.924242424242424
894586,5,6304501684,"Micro Cosmos is a nature documentary by French biologists and filmmakers Claude Nuridsany and Marie Perennou that features incredible close-up photography with high-powered lenses of the insect world. In a nearly wordless 75 minutes, the filmmakers take the viewer on a fascinating journey into a world seldom seen in such startling detail. Though the lack of narration might be frustrating to those who want to know more about what they're seeing, the result is an almost poetic look into a world of some of the smallest creatures on Earth.

 The action (if you can call it that) takes place on a single sunny summer day in the meadow of the French countryside. With an obvious attempt to make the images both beautiful and amusing, the film focuses on ladybugs, swallowtail butterflies, caterpillars, pheasants, snails, bees, beetles, spiders and red ants as they go about their daily activities, which include fighting, gathering food, and sex.

The film score by Bruno Coulais is frequently synchronized to the insects movements, providing a cinematic version of a dance. Micro Cosmos does for insects what Winged Migration did for birds  showing us a world from points-of-view never explored before. This is a great film for anyone fascinated with the mysteries of the insect world. Its an especially enjoyable movie for kids, offering a pleasant change of pace from cartoons or dopey comedies. Its certainly educational, though not heavy handed. Its the entertainment value that will glue kids to the screen.

Bonus features on the G-rated Blu-ray release include a making-of documentary, interview with directors Claude Nuridsany and Marie Perennou, and a trailer.",1493078400,,1671,5.2434456928838955

A French meadow on a summer's day is the setting for this incredible, highly-acclaimed film that takes its microscopic cameras into the heart of the insect world.

In this miniature environment where a single raindrop can cause havoc, we are treated to an array of jaw-dropping moments: an underwater spider makes a home out of an air bubble, a colony of ants face a massacre when a pheasant attacks; a determined beetle struggles to relocate his ball of dung.

There's drama, comedy, action and even a little love in this astonishing film that invites us to share the trials and tribulations of its wonderful cast. The film features English narration, and the bonus features including a French narration with English subtitles.

Studio: Second Sight Films UK / Galate Films [France]

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Second Sight Films UK has released a heart-warming nature documentary about myriad species of animals nurturing their young, along with a well-known stunning awesome insect film. MICROCOSMOS focuses on a community of insects going about their short existence, as told from the point of view of millions of colourful bugs living in a peaceful meadow in the French countryside.

Wildlife documentaries are popular for giving the viewer an intimate view into the world of animals, reptiles, insects and so forth, allowing us to see things we normally wouldnt get to see due to both the dangers, and geographical logistics involved. While there have been many documentary segments done on various insects around the globe, none have gotten as astonishingly close-up to these living organisms during such pivotal moments in their existence as MICROCOSMOS does.

It took fifteen years of research, and three years of shooting on cameras that took two years to create just for this film in order to complete this documentary, and if thats not dedication to something you love, Im not sure what is. Luckily for Claude Nuridsany and Marie Perennou, who co-wrote and co-directed the film together, their labour of love paid off, as MICROCOSMOS is definitely a rare experience to be had.

There are a great many moments during the films 75-minute runtime that are just shocking to see so close. While the hatching of a butterfly from a cocoon is wonderful to watch in its own right, it was the birth of a bee, though it could have been a wasp, from its larva state all the way to it building its own cocoon, to it breaking free as a full grown bee (or wasp). Its really amazing to see such a thing so close, as there is no privacy to be had for these insects in this documentary. There are multiple moments where mating is shown, and who knew that the biggest exhibitionist would be the snail? But they are, and as the two go at it, albeit in an affectionate looking way their romance is met with an orchestrated score that just screams, These two snails are in love, now watch nature in all its glory.

Another shocking sequence is watching a rainfall up close and how it affects this world of insects. Whenever theres a quick shower, or a day of rain, its a pain for us because we get a little wet while running to the car, or we cant have a Barbecue. Well, in the world of insects that exists right below our feet, a small shower can mean the difference between life and death, and a few hours of heavy rain is the equivalent of a flash flood for us. Anthills are destroyed and caved in, while other insects are stranded as the waters rage around them. Once the storm subsides, its back to work, as the ants rebuild their home, and those insects lucky enough to not get caught up in the flood regain their footing and move forward. Its these up close encounters that one never really thinks about that really make MICROCOSMOS an interesting watch.

Of course, not all of the footage was captured in the wild, as Claude Nuridsany and Marie Perennou rebuilt certain sections of the habitat in order to capture the truly up close shots that they desired to match what they had laid out in pre-production. Its also crazy to learn that certain shots they wanted. such as the dragonflies laying their eggs, which only happened once a year, and if their schedule for that particular insect overlapped with another, they would have had to wait another full year to get the footage of that particular shot. MICROCOSMOS is a very interesting look into the world of insects, and it still stands strong today, even though it was filmed back in 1996. Its definitely worth seeking out, and it will make you think twice next time before you swat a spider or a fly. Youll likely still swat it because, well, its a bug; but youll very likely think twice about it beforehand.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The awesome stunning 1080p encoded image of the documentary is sharp and crisp, filled with vibrant colours, and solid darks. Presented in an enhanced [Anamorphic] for widescreen in an 1.66:1 aspect ratio. MICROCOSMOS looks excellent for the most part. Some scenes did have a little bit of dust on them, but mainly the time-lapse shots, but everything else was so crisp and clear that individual hairs on a bees thorax were visible at all times. Colours were deep and very true to life, especially noticeable after the rainstorm when the lighting conditions change slightly. Please Note: Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The 5.1 DTS-HD Surround Sound audio for the film is beautifully transferred, with the orchestrated score coming through loud and clear, especially crisp at all times. The various sounds of the insects throughout are also perfectly transferred, helping bring the entire world to life. Just like the video, it's tough not to be happy with this stereo only presentation. The sounds packed a punch when it needed to, like during close ups of newly hatched wasps drying their wings, or when the beak of the pheasant was pounding the ground while devouring ants. But most impressive is when a fly zooms all around your back speakers.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: The World of Microcosmos: An Interview with the Director [1080p] This feature runs at 40-minutes in length and sees Claude Nuridsany and Marie Prennou talk about their love of nature, and everything that went into the building of the film. They are French, so the feature is presented with subtitles, yet their passion for the topic helps make it all the more interesting.

Special Feature: The Making of Microcosmos [1080p] This feature is 13-minutes in length, and is basically a behind-the-scenes look at how the filmmakers went out into the fields around their studio in order to find some of the principle cast for the documentary. We get to see the cameras they built for the piece, as well as the homemade set they used to get a number of the close-up shots.

Special Feature: The Story of Five Cesars [1080p] This is a 48-minute feature that covers the musical side of the film, as well as the editing and sound aspects. Its filled with interviews that are also subtitled, but it really shows how much time and effort went into putting together this documentary.

Finally, MICROCOSMOS is something that everyone should see at least once, as it gives an unbelievable perspective into a world that literally functions right below our feet. Not all sequences in the film are as interesting as others, but more often than not, the scenarios caught on film are things you won't find anywhere else. When something is as well put together as MICROCOSMOS it is only right to recommend this awesome fantastic Blu-ray disc. As mentioned before, as popping this stunning Region B/2 Blu-ray disc in the player gave me such a thrill, in fact I've watched it loads of times since receiving it and just to marvel at how well it is put together. I think the fact that there is no human voice or scenes with humans in it is a blessing, because you can become fully immersed into this tiny world and enjoy all it has to offer without any distractions. I would imagine that children would be even more fascinated by this film than adults would be, and based on my desire to watch it repeatedly, I could see the replay value of this to be extremely high. Ever since I purchased this in 1996 via a French PAL LaserDisc, and I have loved this brilliant French Documentary film ever since and I never get tired of watching it, as the 5.1 DTS-HD Surround Sound really fires up the Homes Cinema surround sound and really gets you up close and personal to all the fascinating creatures you get to view on your Smart 3D Flat screen Television and as mentioned above, and it has won numerous Awards and it deserved everyone, especially how long it took to make and the people behind the scene certainly had some very amazing patience in getting the fantastic images, and how it shows, especially in High Definition, but I am personally disappointed that it could not of been produced in 3D, especially with the latest technology in turning a 2D film, into 3D images. Still despite that, it is still a stunning Blu-ray disc and will give you endless hours of pleasure, as well impress all your friends and family, especially if they are heavily into nature, as each time you view the disc, you will see something totally new. Very Highly Recommended!

894806,4,6304501684,"There are about 950,000 species of insects on Earth. This was an amazing movie that lets us see just a few of them in their everyday lives - caterpillars, ladybugs, bees, wasp, butterflies, beetles, snails, grass hoppers, spiders and many more.

The cinematography is breath taking. I still wonder how they got a camera tiny enough to fit into an ant colony so we could watch them store food. Watching a spider eat a shrimp under water is head tilting.

It is an amazing film which lets you watch insects being born. I never thought of bugs as cute before. Well, maybe a lady bug and I do have a pet preying mantis but, this film actually made me want to pet a few of them. You could actually see that bumble buzzes are cute and fluffy, that snails fall in love and ants like to have clean faces. The birth of the insects is fascinating. They all come from eggs and eat them when they are born. Then they dry off and are ready to play in the world.

My favorite scene is watching a butterfly come out of its cocoon.  They are stunning and you get to see every detail of their beautiful wings. I also loved watching the lady bugs take off and fly with their hard, bright red spotted shells and hidden wings for flight.
The caterpillars are very cute. There is a large variety of them, all with different faces. Viewing the flowers waking up each morning and how they wrap themselves up for a good night sleep was stunning. I never knew how insects got pollen and now I do.

The time lapse photography of watching a Venus fly trap capture a bee is another wow moment in this movie. This is a visual film with the audio being that of the surroundings. Insects don't really talk so it is all about natural sounds. I recommend this film for ages 4 to 18. I think an audience as young as 4 would love this movie.  It might seem a bit long so I would split it up into a few viewings. For bugs lovers, this is a must see. I give this movie 4  Twinkling Stars.

Even though this movie gave me a new prospective on insects and I found them to be incredible I think I will still keep my fly swatter handy.

Allows me to take in God's beauty as per his design.  I would compare this move to the movie ""One Life"".  In that they both do a superb job of capturing nature as it unfolds in front of you.  The difference being ""One Life"" explains the animals in great detail but in a manner a child would still enjoy.  My only negative to ""One Life"" would be the evolutionary undertones.",1387324800,,669,4.1

895085,5,6304501684,"""Microcosmos"" may just be the perfect cure for arachnophobia.  Never have bugs (at least the non-Pixar bugs) ever been so fascinating and adorable.

And this comes from someone who has had a life-long case of the heeby-jeebies when it comes to bugs, thanks to a demented older brother and a gallon-jug full of carpenter ants.

""Microcosmos"" brings bugs into your home in the most enjoyable manner possible - in lush widescreen.  The filmmakers take great care to emphasize the beauty and variety of the bug world, although they show us plenty of bugs we have seen in our own back yard.  Sure, we'd be shocked at what you might find in Costa Rica or Madagascar, but this film reveals the glories that can be found etched in the wings of an everyday moth, the engineering genius of an underwater spider, and the defenseless innocence of an ant colony facing a hungry pheasant.

The filmmakers are smart, however, to keep most of the ""violence"" in the film relatively tame.  No trapdoor spiders leaping out to snag friendly ladybugs, no preying mantises devouring mates.  Instead we see stag beetles going buggo-a-buggo, to little effect.  This is a movie that revels in the beauty that is the insect world, not its horrors.  No tarantulas - hooray!

This is one of the great family movies - the kids will love it, and the adults will be fascinating by it.  Like BBC's ""Planet Earth"" or the heavenly ""Winged Migration,"" this is required viewing if you have ever been fascinated or disgusted by a bug.",1248048000,,1497,4.737451737451737
895086,4,6304501684,"Claude Nuridsany and Marie Perennou created one of the most arresting nature films of the year in 1996 with their Microcosmos which won the Technical Grand Prize at the Cannes Film Festival. The film depicts in stunning close up the  lives of the insects in a meadow in Aveyron, France. We see ants and bees as they go about the business of pollination, we have the mating ritual of snails, the battle of horned beetles and perhaps most stunning the metamorphosis of a caterpillar into a butterfly and the birth of a mosquito.

The photography is stunning and carries the film. The dialogue by Kristen Scott Thomas is minimal. The idea here is to show that mother nature is the greatest special effects creator of all. The music by  Bruno Coulais fits the mood perfectly. This is a great film for the entire family and comes highly recommended.

Some of the shots are so close that, at first, you don't know what insect you're seeing. Other insects are not familiar ones you'd recognize, anyway. Some are really strange-looking.

The colors, the wild shapes and actions of these creatures all make a for a fascinating movie in parts, one that literally all ages should enjoy, as the clich goes. I found, however, that with no dialog, it was tough to watch more than 30 minutes at one time. You might want to break this up into two or three segments. There is sound, however: the sound these insects make. With the camera-work, it makes you feel as if you, too, were a small object on the ground listening to these strange sounds.

895142,1,6304501684,"If you are looking for a Nature documentary and would like to learn more about invertebrate biology, then look elsewhere. This movie is a bit like a silent-era movie, but played by small, incognito alien creatures. In Microcosmos, no effort is made to explain or describe, the scenes that are presented. Though or perhaps because the images are gorgeous, the movie feels even more vacuous and futile.

This is an incredible movie.  I don't know how they did this, but it certainly enriches the students' learning.

We were expecting the unsurpassed life-capturing video technology displayed in ""Winged Migration"" with its musical score uniqueness that captured the magnificence of flight in all the world's arenas. But ""MicroCosmos"" of bug life was a dud; all-dreary in comparison.

However, being interested in biology, I read the reviews and gave it a go. I was not disappointed.  This movie is everything the description and reviews says it is. You will like it most for the incredible close-ups of the ""smaller majority"". Insects by far outnumber every other living thing in our world, yet we hardly notice them and take them for granted. This movie will show you THEIR world and all the amazing forms ""bugs"" take.

There are mating scenes, fighting scenes, and everything in between. All is suitable for kids and adults of all ages. I found the very best part was when watching it with my 6 and 3 year old sons, they asked lots of great questions and it gave me the opportunity to explain all sorts of important concepts like ecology, predatory-prey relationship, etc. Of course, how do you not smile watching a dung beetle and talking about an animal that eats ""poo-poo"".

I think the most important concept communicated is the one of relativity - the movie shows you that the world really looks different through other creature's eyes. A great example of this was a series of scenes that showed a rainstorm; first, as a human would see it (with the camera zoomed out) and then close up. You see a ladybug launched off a leaf after just one raindrop hit the leaf; you see a grasshopper struggling through a ""raging river""; and you see raindrops hit the ground like artillery fire.

Now, after witnessing Microcosmos, the file name will remain the same, but the urgency with which I comingled ten years of expectations remains too, incomplete.

I find insects both fascinating and brilliant. I don't shy from them, and I respect them and their significance on Earth deeply. What Microcosmos does very effectively is enhace, through a kind of anthropomorphic scoring and direction-is it possible not to?-the existence of insects. With fabulous cinematography and technical wizardry I saw the amazing world of these creatures and came to love them even more.

But my habit of wanting more prevented me from completely accepting this finished piece. Though shortness is appreciated, the lack of narrative or explanation left me intellectually reaching. I like in a documentary such as this for the equally awesome intricacies that research and biological understanding produce, to be layered with the visual wonderment.

Sensual, slimy and sticky snails, beetles on the battle branch, a humorous chorus of caterpillars, foolish grasshoppers laid waste to by the patience precient spider....

There is no denying the awesomeness of the smaller, microcosmic world of Microcosmos. I know this is re-watchable to many degrees and particularly fantastic for children.",1170115200,2,1451,5.402654867256637

The photography is truly mind-boggling, as micro-cameras and super-sensitive microphones lead us to the small-scale life in European meadows and forests. We see the bugs eating, making baby bugs, fighting, watching for prey or predators, coping with rain and sun, and enjoying daily life. However, the lack of narrative sometimes left me confused as to what kind of insect I was watching, and why the creature was behaving in that way. There are only a few sentences spoken aloud by an unseen woman in the whole 90 minutes. The silence, to me, rather than increasing the artfulness of the documentary, deprived me of knowledge and understanding. I think documentaries exist to help us learn things we don't already know, and in this respect, ""Microcosmos"" fails. I suspect that it will bore most kids, rather than inspire them.

However, Jacques Perrin's other acclaimed film Winged Migration is much better, in my opinion.  If you really want to see a masterpiece, you MUST watch that film.  Actually, just watch the film.  Amazing.  Absolutely. Amazing.

Microcosmos feels rushed in comparison.  The ending is also weak.  I was expecting a strong ending to wrap up the story, but instead I was left leaning forward in my seat expecting another 15 minutes of film.  It almost feels like Jacques wasn't quite sure how to end the movie and was rushed into producing the whole film.

I can't really call it a documentary... It's more of an art film. The only human speech occurs at the beginning at the end, and it's minimal. The images are mostly of insects going about their daily lives. You might not think that sounds interesting, but I sat in rapt wonder, my breakfast forgotten and my eyeballs drying out because I didn't want to blink.

If insects make you squirm and freak out, then this film probably isn't for you. But if you find them at all fascinating... Well, I think I've made my point.

There are no actors and special effect as nature takes front stage and manages to impress, captivate and astound the viewer. There is very little talking involved as Kristin Scott Thomas narrates quickly in the beginning and lets the music takes over to the beat of the Earth itself.

From the beginning I was transported back to the meadows of Poland where I spent many happy warm childhood days on my grandparent's farm in the summer. The red poppies, filed flowers, birds and animals were both familiar and foreign at the same time. The incredibly detailed close-ups and ultra sharp picture quality made every grass strand sway and dance in the wind, each water droplet glisten, each feather, tentacle and grain of sand was in high display as if in a museum for everyone to admire.

The day in the life of a bug on a French meadow, in the ponds and sandy plateaus was incredible to watch. The struggles for survival and their daily grind was shown in a rather beautiful light with pleasurable disposition. I felt an intimate connection with Mother Nature as I got a glimpse of uninterrupted life of the many beautiful and complex creatures that cover out planet and form such a huge part of the eco system. Their life and death goes unnoticed yet their vital role is really wonderfully portrayed in Microcosmos with careful and painstakingly filmed moments which reveal so much in depth information that it can be mind boggling at times. These tiny titans live and fight, love and reproduce even when some of those insects only have a twenty four hour life span they still make the most of it. I love the snails; ants, salamanders; even the scary spiders and beetles, ladybugs, millipedes and dozens of other mini masters of our planet roam around and live almost unnoticed right under our noses.",1150588800,10,1912,4.756024096385542

Being familiar with other works of Jacques Perrin and his various collaborateurs (e.g. Le Peuple Migrateur/Winged Migration, and Himalaya) one appreciates their unique contribution in capturing and bringing to life on screen the enormous beauty of landscapes and animal life.  Their achievement is in transforming the audience experience from one of observer to participant.  They do this by deliberately creating multiple objectives . . . balancing artistic, scientific and cultural perspectives with technical innovations (new cameras and filming techniques). The emergence of a truly outstanding onscreen experience is the result of blending and bending these different perspectives. The credits at the end point to the variety of disciplines and contributers. Try to let go of your need to ""learn something"" in a conventional way, or to see a film typical of the Discovery Channel.

I purchased ""Microcosmos"" on the advice of a good friend whose opinion I value a great deal. Unable to find it anywhere to rent, I decided that it was probably worth the money... and the worst-case scenario would be that I would donate it after watching it to the local library.

I'm keeping it. The videography is absolutely STUNNING, and the subject matter is fascinating. It's rather ironic, actually. Forty years ago, the best ""Star Trek"" could muster was some pointy rubber ears to denote an alien... when in reality, the diversity of form of creatures under our very feet makes the concept of a ""true"" alien having no discernable difference from us other than pointy ears rather laughable. ***

In fact, some of the living, breathing creatures that walk, crawl, fly over, and skitter in the waters around us... would seem absurd if they were depicted as aliens in a science fiction film. Reality really is stranger than fiction.

As for the narration in ""Microcosmos"" it is all but absent. There are two brief interludes where a female narrator says perhaps 20 words... and frankly, she is describing something self evident (along the lines of: ""...another day begins..."")

While the film stands on its own WITHOUT a narrative, and I personally knew enough about insects to (mostly) know what was going on, I think it's unfortunate that some form of narrative is not available... even optionally as ""bonus"" material.

For someone who DOESN'T know much, if anything about the insect world, ""Microcosmos"" won't teach them a thing. They might find it beautiful and intriguing, but they won't learn anything.

*** Before some Trekkie gets really upset with me, I DO understand that part of their rationale was financial. They didn't have enough MONEY to make really interesting aliens!

895373,5,6304501684,"In similar vein to Reggio's seminal Koyaanisqatsi, Microcosmos is a film without commentary, other than a one-sentence introduction and a few poetic words at the close.
It presents the viewer with a gorgeous series of tableaux starring the amazing micro-fauna occupying a meadow. I guarantee the first thing that springs to mind when viewing Microcosmos  for the first time is ""how did they film that?!!""  Achingly beautiful close-ups of ants, caterpillars, butterflies, snails, ladybirds, the bizarrely alien-looking mantis and dozens more give us an unique insight into the oft-ignored world beneath our feet.
The whole 72 minutes is one great therapeutic trip - just sit in your comfiest chair and let the vivid colours and sumptuous sound (natural insect noises occasionally punctuated with minimalist ambient music) wash over you.
Favourite scenes include the sissyphus-like dung-beetle, the ants at the ""waterhole"", the snail lovers, the spider's ""aqualung"", the stag beetles' battle and the jaw-droppingly stunning finale of the nascent mosquito breaking free of the meniscus of the pond on its impossibly long legs. Even the moment of microcosmic horror, when a strangely prehistoric looking pheasant perpetrates some genocide, is magnificently filmed and utterly satisfying.
Possibly the first wildlife film to cross the boundary into pure art.
I guarantee you will feel a better and more harmonious person for having viewed Microcosmos.",1088035200,8,1446,5.568181818181818

  The movie is originally in french, but it was theatrically released in the U.S. to very favorable reviews.  It starts off as if you are in a dream and then allows you to enter into the world of insects...like no other movie ever...
  The camera work puts you on the same level as the insects because it really gets close up with spectacular detail...The 5.1 soundtrack might be one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard, it has crisp clean detail and powerful bass...I really recommend this Dvd.  Ever since I bought the  laserdisc years ago I have been a big fan of this documentary.

The people that made this movie spend 3 YEARS developing their lenses and cameras for this specific project and it shows! The detail on these highly magnified insects is breath taking. Literally. I was in awe for ever second that I watch this. And by amplifying the sounds I was sucked right in. I felt like I was there, surrounded by GIGANTIC insects!

895381,5,6304501684,"I have never been particularly interested in bugs. In fact, I have in most cases viewed them with a mixture of disgust, disinterest or (in the case of flies and mosquitoes, particularly) loathing. After watching this film, I want to become an amateur entomologist. It really is that revelatory and inspiring.
  A team of Swiss, Italian and French cinematographers and naturalists take us to a lush meadow in the south of France and reveal, through microphotography, the unseen (or at least, generally unnoticed) inhabitants at work and play there.

 This is nature documentary at its finest. Insects that we all take for granted are displayed close-up, and are revealed to be perfect in their symmetry of form, their coloration, their awesome design. It does give one a renewed sense of appreciation for creation in all its myriad forms: nature is diverse and abundantly versatile.
  The film's creators, by supplying a sometimes playful, sometimes dramatic, soundtrack, add to the anthropomorphic qualities of the micro vignettes. For instance, the long, languid scene depicting snails mating is accompanied by a Puccini aria. Though this may sound trite (how many Puccini arias have been overused in recent years?), even loathsome, if one had the opinion of snails as slimy, ugly creatures that I  had,  it is instead one of the most beautiful, and dare I say, sensuous, scenes I`ve ever witnessed. Instead of noxious looking, the snails are beautiful, their intricately shaded and colored shells gleaming , as they engage in a pas-de-deux that would put Nureyev and Fonteyne to shame.
  Also especially memorable is the segment involving a dung beetle, doggedly engaged in rolling a ball of dung up a slope of gravel. As he plods on, one can't help but admire his determination and his fortitude. He is a miniature Sisyphus, engaged in an eternal struggle in his uphill battle for survival. The ball of dung (about five times his size) becomes stuck on a sharp shoot sticking up out of the ground. He doesn't know why the ball won't move, yet he doesn't give up. He rolls and prods and shoves until finally he goes over to the side on which the ball is stuck and succeeds in removing it. Nature rewards perseverance. Actually, this could be thought of as one of the themes of the movie. All of these Hymenoptera, Neuropterans, and Heptira, etc., are hard workers, ceaselessly engaged in what they were put on earth to do.
  Even the most detested of insects, the mosquito, is shown to be a part of the grand design at the conclusion of the film. In one of the marvelous time-lapse birth sequences that are a thread in the movie, a mosquito is shown forming from its larval  stage on the surface of a pond. The viewer is not sure exactly what sort of creature it is until it finally flies off and we hear its all-too-familiar buzzing.
  One way of thinking of this film is that it is the Cirque de Soleil of nature documentaries. The same sort of outside the  box creativity went into this production. It's magnificent in every respect and should be seen and appreciated by viewers of all ages.",1027900800,182,3096,4.80225988700565

This film exposes one to the beautiful, fearsome, and even romantic world of stag beetles, snails, ants, and more. The scene of the re-birth of a mosquito from its larval stage is as graceful and inspiring as any ballet. Caterpillars are comical and the viewer can see every hair shimmer upon their chubby bodies. Stag beetles lock horns over territory while their battle resounds from the speakers as if they were the size of rams.
This film inspires anyone at any age. I will never tire of seeing it.",1015286400,,584,4.735294117647059

The original needed no words to be effective, but I have to admit to being curious about the details-just what are some of those creatures and how/why do they do that?  FANTASTIC!",1015027200,,468,4.2727272727272725

You are absolutely IN the extremely small, lush green world of brave carpenter ants and sensuous snails.  Not to mention a bunch of other previously creepy and now fabulously, gloriously creepy creatures.  The music score completes the picture ranging from triumphant to sublime.
Since this world is a bit closer to a child's recent experience than an adult, you might think it's for kids.  But the production values make it a great escape movie, full youthful feelings of wonder for adults.
WE NEED IT ON DVD. A HOME THEATER EXPERIENCE OF THIS FILM WOULD BE TREMENDOUS.",1003190400,,673,4.920353982300885
895396,4,6304501684,"This is one of the strangest movies I have ever seen.  It shows everyday life among bugs in a European meadow.  It shows snails mating, ants scrambling for shelter to avoid being eaten by a pheasant, a dung beetle rolling his delicious (?) dinner up a hill, and other things bugs do in their everyday lives. That's it, there's no real plot to it, it's just a documentary.
Okay, so it's not exactly something you'd take a girl on a date to see, but it's a very well-made film.  The camerawork is truly astounding.  I don't know how they got such incredible close-ups.  I became totally engrossed in this fascinating tale of everyday life in a world that nobody notices, yet it's right in our very own backyards.  ""Microcosmos"" is a great movie to show to anyone who is interested in nature (I myself saw it in a high school biology class), and it's kid-friendly too!
The one thing I did not like about ""Microcosmos"" was the overly bombastic music played during several scenes of the film.",1002585600,82,987,4.548022598870056
895397,3,6304501684,"Insects have had a bit of a run in movies recently.  But rather than relying on anthropomorphism too much, it is worth taking a while to look at what they are really like.
'Microcosmos' is a movie supposedly about one day in a field.  Since it took three years to film, we know this isn't quite true...  With no storyline, we are simply treated to nature in her infinite variety with snippets of the lives of insects forming a montage of scenes which allows us, as viewers, to infer how big and busy a simple field really is.
The filming is excellent, and I am sure that Claude Nuridsany and Marie Perennou were delighted with the ad lib performances their cast gave them - real animals do amazing things that no amount of computer animation can ever compare to.
My one complaint: a movie of this kind is likely to appeal to people who enjoyed such films as 'Koyaanisqatsi' and 'Baraka'.  One of the way those movies succeeded that 'Microcosmos' doesn't is in the soundtrack.  In ""Microcosmos', some scenes are accompanied by strong musical scores, whilst others are virtually silent.  This shifting of aural gears becomes distracting, and I believe detracts from the film.  It would have benefited from either a strong score throughout the film, or minimal or no music.",972604800,14,1270,4.719457013574661
895398,5,6304501684,"In addition to the great cinematography and sound, the best thing about Microcosmos is the lack of narration.  Throughout the movie you will find yourself wondering why an insect behaves a certain way.  Why did it EVOLVE  to behave that way, etc.  You will have theories about what an insect is  doing, and sometimes you will see things that corroborate your theory or  disprove it.  More often than not you never really know for sure what the  point or the details of a particular behavior is.  I had to do some  research the day after I saw it to find out what really was going on with  some of the bugs.",952387200,9,606,4.36936936936937
895399,5,6304501684,"I rented this video, because I had heard lots of good things about it.  However, it was with the assumption that I was not going to sit in front of the TV for the duration of the film, but rather, that I would play the  video while going about my business at home, and check to see what was on  the screen from time to time.  Much to my surprise, I found myself stopping  in front of the TV, unable to pull myself away, especially when I witnessed  what looked like a black beetle, as  he vigorously strove to move a rock to  an obviously desired location (perhaps his ""home""?).  I was in  awe of his determination, as each time the rock would rock backwards, he  would start all over again, and kept at it, until he got the rock to where  he wanted it.  I was also amazed at the way the film was able to depict the  beauty of insects, many of which I would consider ""yucky"" in the  real world.  I always knew that insects were amazing, and that ants in  particular were highly organized, but I don't think I'll ever look at  insects quite the same way again!",950227200,28,1059,4.158415841584159

Anyway, not just death  and destruction here. Also, the creation, of life, caught on camera. Even  though they were just snails, the opera music really made their love scene  romantic, and inspiring.
