1033398,1,6305451613,"Assassin is a great movie I remember from the 1980s and I was eager to see it again. Good acting and a great story about a robot assassin hunting government officials. The only problem is the video itself. First of all, there was no opening credits and the entire start of the movie was missing. From the quality and color of the actual picture, I could tell that it was just a VHS tape converted to DVD. The quality was really that bad and very difficult to watch in some scenes. Plus, the main menu doesnt work. You press start and it takes you back to the main menu again. So I tried just pressing scene 1 from the scenes list and the movie starts but well into the picture. This was a television movie and it would be nice if the network that originally made it would release it with superior quality. I doubt that will happen so save your money. I purchased this movie through Tower.com in the U.S. which is linked to Amazon. I'm hoping it will show on television some time so I can tape it myself and have the complete picture. There are other copies with different covers available but I was worried the quality would be the same as this one so I didn't try ordering any of them. If anyone out there does order one of them and you have no problems with it then please leave a review stating so for the rest of us Robert Conrad fans.",1385856000,4,1339,4.234375

1033400,2,6305451613,"A robot named Golem (Richard Young) has been given a hit list. He also knows all the people in the agency. In order to kill the robot a retired agent is brought back out of retirement (Robert Conrad as Henry Stanton). He believes he is protecting the flirty Mary Casallas (Karen Austin) from some rouge assassin. When he finds out it is actually a robot, he punches everyone around him, like a scene in ""Airplane.""

The movie reminded me of a low budget made for TV ""Terminator"" knock off complete with the roommate of Sarah Connor. The ending was a bit comical and I never did understand the twist they suddenly tossed in. A real yawner for a science fiction action film.",1354752000,,672,4.508196721311475

1033403,3,6305451613,"This science-fiction film stars Robert Conrad as Henry Stanton, a retired C.I.A. operative who is persuaded by his former supervisor (Robert Webber) to accept another mission, one in which it is hoped that he may be able to address a problem of a rogue agent, Robert Golem (Richard Young), who is homicidal, with his victims being Agency and high government officials. Stanton is accompanied in his efforts to locate the vicious renegade by another former Agency employee, now one of Golem's targets, Mary Cassales (Karen Austin) who reveals to her new partner that the killer as an almost indestructible robot, designed for assassination purposes, and that she was instrumental in its production. The script, by director Sandor Stern, contains some interesting material, and neatly explains Asimov's three laws of robotics, but elements of romantic love between the two protagonists and between Golem and a smitten woman (Jessica Nelson) seem extraneous, and a point of view is difficult to find throughout. Conrad is most effective during the film's first half, when he is able to use his deceptively simple naturalistic skills, and Austin always contributes a developed interpretation, with only a lack of any sensual chemistry between Conrad and her serving to somewhat hamper the narrative's rhythm. Stern directs well and the work never becomes dull; however, his scenario is rather serried with story lines and he loses his way as the picture moves along, inevitably giving most emphasis to a series of frenetic action scenes, most of which demonstrate the android's superhuman physical talents. Although obviously derivative, the score by Anthony Guefen is effective, and particularly so in connection with scenes meant to generate feelings of suspense, while Chuck Arnold handles the cinematography nicely and there is crisp editing as always by James Calloway.",1146528000,5,1870,5.363945578231292

Truth be told it is very much on par with most television at the time.  The worst part comes at the end (I won't spoil it for you) but ""disappointing"" is the only way to describe it. I did like the sci fi element to the story but as much potential as the idea had it is never full taken advantage of and in fact is pretty much squandered.

1033774,1,6305451613,Video quality is extremely bad.,1439683200,,31,5.4
1033775,3,6305451613,"Part of the problems with ""Assassin"" is that the premise (a killer robot hunting down humans) has been done much better, many times, in the years since the movie was made. It's pre-CGI, and low budget, so you can't blame it really for having poor special FX.  But even as a period piece, bearing in mind what was and wasn't possible when it was made, it's a major flop.

The production values are poor. The resolution is very low.  The print is so dark in places that it's often hard to tell what's going on.  It was made for television and it shows: the scenes seem designed to be viewed on a small television screen, with a preponderance of closeups and medium shots.  The audio sounds like it was made for television too, from the days when TV sets had poor sound systems and tinny speakers. Assassin was made in the 80s but has the feeling of early 70s television, like an overly long episode of some show like Six Million Dollar Man.

If the story was interesting it might still be worth watching, but it's dull and lackluster, a thriller with little or no suspense.  Scenes come and go without advancing the plot.  The robot wanders around killing people we have not had a chance to get to know or care about. Or trying to kill them.  The ones it does kill are such bland bozos that it's not sad to see them die.  In one scene it picks up a woman and spends the night with her.  She giggles and implies they had sex all night.  But the scene, the sex and the woman have nothing to do with the story and none of them are ever referred to again.  They appear to be filler to make the movie last the required number of minutes.

The narrative is predictable and gives us no real reason to care about any of the characters.  Even the fact that it's a robot turns out to be irrelevant. It's a robot that shoots people. But so what? Is it worse to be shot by a robot than a person?

Here I should stick in a ******** SPOILER WARNING******** for anyone who keeps watching all the way to the end:

SPOILER 1: The robot dies at the end. (Surprise.) However, the hero doesn't kill it.  In fact he doesn't end up doing much at all. I couldn't really figure out, by the end of the movie, why he had even been in the film.

Spoiler 2:  After killing a bunch of boring guys and trying to kill some other guys, the robot  gets stuck in a room but can't leave because the door gets stuck, so it's locked in.  That's all. It gets locked in a room.  This apparently is too much for its high tech sophisticated humanoid killing machine brain. It does not do anything a human might do in that situation, such as finding something in the room to break down the door (or break it down itself... it was shown punching through a few walls and breaking through a locked door earlier.)  Instead, it gets wigged out and starts spinning around in circles making an irritating high pitched sound, then blows up. (It may have just felt like exiting the movie, and blowing up was the easiest way to do so.)

If you can watch Assassin for free as part of Amazon Prime, just to blow some time when there's nothing else to do, Assassin should work for that; otherwise I'd skip this one.",1432512000,,3158,4.276094276094276
