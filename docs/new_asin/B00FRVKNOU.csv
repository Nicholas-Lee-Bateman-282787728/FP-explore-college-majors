8618411,2,B00FRVKNOU,"How's your Spanish? Though the case prominently blazons that this Blu-Ray disk has English subtitles, DG weirdly and inexplicably (or stupidly and lazily, more likely) makes English subtitles available only for all of the sections of the disk and performance where Erwin Schrott is speaking English. Get it? Whenever he speaks English in his introductions to the music, you can read English in the subtitles. But whenever he sings in Spanish (which is for all of the songs, every last one of them, 95 percent of the content of this disk), no subtitles are available. None. So you're on your own, pal. You let yourself be tricked by the case. Who does quality control on these releases anyway?",1416355200,2,692,4.872881355932203
