2763769,2,B000NA6CQI,"One of my primary problems with this series is the main character's state-of-mind. She's angry, irrational, and out-of-control. There is no way someone in that condition would be allowed anywhere near a police investigation. In the very least she'd be under investigation for attacking people. She might wind up in then hospital for her own safety. The characters are interesting and the initial plot pulled me in. But the switch between cities, the sudden change from murder investigation to organized crime, and the unrealistic main character makes it impossible to continue watching.",1502496000,,586,5.380434782608695
2763770,4,B000NA6CQI,"I found this movie to be VERY entertaining and intriguing, especially for a seemingly small/independent film.  Well acted and written.  I wonder if this actually happens in hollywood.....",1338768000,,187,5.642857142857143
2763771,5,B000NA6CQI,"I saw ""In The Dark"" at a film festival in Los Angeles and thought it was just fantastic. I would call it a dramedy leaning more towards the drama. There are a few twists and turns to keep your attention until the very end and that's what I like in a movie. I love the fact that a little indie film can be so much better than most studio films. Cheers to the film-makers for living the dream!",1182384000,,391,4.0256410256410255
2763772,5,B000NA6CQI,I was pleasantly surprised by the acting in this movie. The agents made you cheer for the good guys...or the guys you thought were good...they did such a good job acting bad. I love the ending! This was a low budget film with great direction and writing. It's well worth the watch.,1181174400,,281,4.423076923076923
2763773,5,B000NA6CQI,"I'm a hypocrite.  I admit it.  I whine and whine about movie like Pirates 3 and Spider-man 3 and Driving Miss Daisy 3 and yet continue to find myself in the theatres watching these big budget films.  Don't get me wrong, these movies serve a purpose and are ultimately unapologetic about the entertainment they provide.

But for every movie you roll your eyes at, there is a little film like this one.  A good movie with a cool story that made me laugh out loud more than once.

The only reason this movie is ""small"" or ""indie"" is because there is no million dollar actor walking through the scenes.  And when you watch the behind-the-scenes clip, you'll know why.  These guys wanted to make a good movie and didn't strive to shoehorn in some actor in some vain attempt to get notice from Sundance.

They wanted to make a movie and they did it.  I didn't want to check it out- I'm honest about it.  I wasn't out there searching the indie scene to alleviate my Hollywood-worn heart.  I just saw it on Netflix, and since I consistently look for ways to stick it to the man, I put as many movies as I can on my queue.

I watched it, shoved it back in its red envelope and then bought it.  I've watched it twice since then and still laugh at some of there idiotically fun extras.

If you've ever come out of a film moaning and groaning about how bad it is and screamed out into the night ""I could have made a better movie on my own,"" then you need to get this movie.  These guys made a fun, smart movie and I truly believe it should be seen.",1180483200,2,1536,4.208904109589041
2763774,5,B000NA6CQI,"Hi, all. I was one of the composers for this film. Matt Clouston (writer and actor) is the older brother of one of my college buddies, Christian (bartender in the film). I had done some music for one of Christian's projects while we were at the University of Michigan, so when Matt had this movie idea, Christian suggested my name. I had done several soundtracks before, both for movies and documentaries, so I knew what I was getting myself into. I sent a CD of my music to Matt, and he and the rest of his team approved. They formally asked me to write the soundtrack, but I told them I would only do it if it was a good movie. I had done work on terrible movies before, and I wasn't going to waste my time again.

Well, they sent me the first rough cut, and I was shocked at what I saw. It was actually good! I told them I'd do it. I knew I was going to be rather busy over the next several months with graduate school, so I asked my buddy, Sam Bottoni, to help me out. Sam is incredibly talented and has a similar style, so I knew it'd all work out.

It was a blast working on this film, and I hope you all enjoy it.

2763775,4,B000NA6CQI,"When I sat down for the first time to view IN THE DARK I had prepared myself for yet another esoteric Indy film characterized by a sketchy plot line and bland unlikeable characters which requires a good amount of patience and persistence in order to just get though it.  What I discovered was this Hollywood fable worthy of Aesop.  The story is well written and moves along at a comfortable pace developing the characters and plot while holding the viewers interest right up to the O Henry/Hitchcockesque twist at the end. Presented as an indictment of the Hollywood film scene it becomes a metaphor of our society as a whole.  Luna and Clouston head a solid cast of actors some of whom seem might seem familiar to many viewers.  They play a likable pair whose friendship runs deep and true. The three movie agents are petty and self-serving as one would expect of men of their vocation.  The directing and cinematography are superb, belying the low budget nature of low budget film making. The film reminded me of the ""morality plays"" of early television which left the viewer feeling that good prevails over evil and all is right with the world.",1178409600,5,1147,4.686567164179104
2763816,3,B000NA6CQI,"First time watching it. Acting was enjoyable. But then there was a MAJOR continuity error that I just could not get past.  When they were driving out to meet her childhood friend (whose husband was accused of taking 2 girls) it was pouring the rain.  MAJOR rain.  But you can see in the sky the sun was shining and the type of clouds were not rain clouds.  Okay so it could have been coming from the other direction right? No.  When they drive through the village the reflection on the windows to the opposite side of the car also showed the same non existent rain.  I mean this shoudl have been caught.  I am sorry, but it lost me after that.",1508112000,,643,4.264462809917355
2763817,5,B000NA6CQI,"Perfect storyline, acting, everything.",1507939200,2,38,8.75
2763818,3,B000NA6CQI,"I wish once, jut once, writers would not succumb to the temptation to always, always make the bad guy the one you don't want it to be!! Of all the possible bad guys, it had to be the one guy she needed it not to be. Other than that most disappointing plot failure, it was a good show. Of course, I did find it very hard to believe that Helen was running around like a drill instructor while so very pregnant and carrying a very large case of guilt and grief on her back.  God forbid anything close to resembling a happy ending anymore. Just saying.",1507420800,2,548,4.169811320754717
2763819,5,B000NA6CQI,Excellent!  Thanks!  I can't wait for the next season!,1505174400,,54,4.888888888888889
2763820,5,B000NA6CQI,"I was skeptical at first, a few minutes in...I was hooked. And I'm picky. I thought the writing was good, and acting well done, direction and editing created a cohesive and riveting series. It was contemporary without trying to be too quirky in a predictable, cheesy way. Highly recommended.",1504656000,3,291,4.959183673469388
2763821,3,B000NA6CQI,"It starts off really well but the the lead acts like such s moron by the 4th episode I found very off putting. Among other things she sleeps with a  very sleazy stalker like guy she has spent the first three episode avoiding. Then even though she knows she is being followed she stops by at her apartment she moved out of for her own protection just to pack up a few things then decides  to have a long hot bath  before she actually moves.
These are just  a few of the ridiculous things she does in episode 4. In short great cast really, bad writing. Message to the producers it helps a show if your lead doesn't devolve into an idiot.",1504569600,7,635,4.180327868852459
2763822,5,B000NA6CQI,I would recommend this show for all ages.,1504483200,,41,4.25

2763825,5,B000NA6CQI,"8/23/17 -- Loved this!  Great script, lots of plot twists along the way, the characters were real human beings.  Where is season 2?",1503446400,3,131,4.6521739130434785
8176334,5,B000NA6CQI,I really  liked it. Hope there will be more. Strong woman character. Thought all the actors did a good job.,1520726400,,107,4.35
8176335,5,B000NA6CQI,I Liked it. Kept you guess till the last episode. Too bad there was one season.,1520294400,,79,4.0
8176336,4,B000NA6CQI,"If I'd stopped before the last episode, I'd have given this a solid 5. Even though the second to last episode was starting to drag a bit, it was still a good series up until then. But the last episode is chock full of irritatingly unbelievable set ups. Let's start with the most basic one. That baby bump Helen's sporting in the final episode would be an embarrassment in a kids Halloween costume. It's lumpy, it shifts around, it's the wrong shape & it's way too big. Trust me. I've done the real thing a few times. That particular costume fail is epic. Also, and this is true of any faux pregnant woman on the screen....WHY are they constantly cradling or holding on to their belly? It's not going anywhere. Again, from experience, this is a glaring oops! Then, there she is, a white, middle class, hugely pregnant woman waddling around the projects randomly questioning people about some drive by shootings. Credible? Then there's the impromptu decision to take a bath in the midst of preparing to vacate and apt. because you aren't safe there. Like you do. What was the point of that? How did that advance the plot?
Such a shame. Like topping a beautiful chocolate cake with a rotten egg.",1520121600,,1192,4.60093896713615
8176337,5,B000NA6CQI,I will never understand the bad reviews some are just picky picky picky as if they could actually do better you know the type the ones in the theater behind you bashing out loud every little thing only they see. And to anyone who was blessed enough not to have been molested at a young or any age you will never understand her character. This is a greatly written series on a complicated woman and the acting is superb.,1518825600,,419,4.3164556962025316
8176338,3,B000NA6CQI,"So So.......If you like to see every stereotype represented, it's here. Didn't find any of the characters worth developing any further....",1515628800,,138,5.619047619047619
8176339,1,B000NA6CQI,"Well, Amazon rejected my first review because it was not specific enough.  Is this specific enough?! This is yet another British TV show that shows a poor story line, terrible acting, and a perverted liberal agenda that is not appreciated!",1514505600,,239,4.975
8176340,4,B000NA6CQI,"I am really enjoying this series. But WHY kill off the most likeable character? Absolutely made me furious. Perhaps he got another show but I really hated this plot twist.
Otherwise, well written, well acted.
Some people object to the main character going off angrily on people, punching people. It happens. Especially with a background like hers (abused as a young teenager). I worked at a big city police dept. There were always some cops/detectives who shoved people up against the wall, etc. I don't like that behavior but it is realistic.",1512691200,3,543,4.913043478260869
8176341,5,B000NA6CQI,Another brilliant Brit crime series.,1510704000,,36,6.4
8176342,5,B000NA6CQI,"Excellent suspense
MyAnna is always a good watch. As a detective, she is fascinatingly fierce and for good reason..her unborn child, her love and partner and for her very life. Lots of twists and gut wrenching conclusions. Just when you think you may have it all figured out, it twists again!
I am begging for another season.",1510704000,2,325,4.719298245614035
8176343,5,B000NA6CQI,No one does police procedural like the Brits. This is a great example.,1508371200,3,70,4.461538461538462
