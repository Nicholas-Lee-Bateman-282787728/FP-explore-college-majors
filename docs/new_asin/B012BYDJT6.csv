8725925,3,B012BYDJT6,"The reason I'm only giving this movie three stars is because it doesn't make much sense.

Here are all the reason's:

1. Too much blood shoots out of Glen's bed when he's killed.

(This makes it more dramatic looking, but come on,nobody has that much blood in their body.  Obviously Glen was murdered by Freddy in a pool full of other victims blood).

2. Freddy tells Nancy he's her boyfriend now.....but wants to kill her .

(Doesn't add up)

3. Nancy's in the third movie, too?
But got defeated by Freddy in this one with her friends in her boyfriend's car.

(How in the world does Nancy survive and defeat Freddy, get all her friends and her mom back,yet get trapped with everyone else in Glen's car after Freddy kills her mom again and the movie ends with the trapped teens getting driven down the road, but yet Nancy is the only one trapped in the car that somehow survives and is in the third movie?)

Nobody can make sense of this.
But i mainly got the movie because Johnny Depp (Glen Lantz) is in it.

I love him in this movie.

Glen and Nancy make a cute couple",1511827200,,1070,4.326633165829146
