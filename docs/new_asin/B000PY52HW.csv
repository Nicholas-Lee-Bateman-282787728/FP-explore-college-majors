8193817,5,B000PY52HW,"An interesting representation that keeps your attention.  My 7th grade science classes liked it.  The Bonus Program on ""Bite Force"" is also good.  Has some interesting facts and is entertaining.",1238976000,3,194,5.4
8193818,3,B000PY52HW,"Granted the video is interesting and has some good facts but this is a video, not a book.  I wanted to see some action and everything seems to be a good hunt only last for about a second or 2.  Twelve fascinating creatures of both India and Africa (24 in total) are to many to cover adequately in one disc.  This should have been a 2 disc feature to demonstrate each animals capabilities, hunting abilities or just what makes then so deadly, rather than just narrating it.  You mostly just see the animals walking in their natural habitat.",1206662400,8,539,4.469387755102041
