8268309,5,B00182FWDO,"These four movies are the start of a wonderful series set in the second half of the nineteenth century.

BUT I'm going to recommend that you not buy this set. For the same price, you can purchase the Tenth Anniversary Edition that contains TEN movies, average price less that a dollar per movie.

I recommend: . . . LOVE COMES SOFTLY - 10TH ANNIVERSARY COLLECTION (see picture)

In the first two movies, we see life on the prairie, as two widows find each other and get married as platonic friends, a friendship that grows into love. We see the man's daughter grow from not wanting another mother to being very glad to have a mother again. In ""Love's Enduring Promise,"" the first movie in this 2-movie set, the daughter, now a teacher, meets and must choose between two very different suitors, but there is so much more in the movie. In ""Love's Long Journey,"" we see Missy and Willie leave the prairie to become cattle ranchers and start a new family.",1428192000,,951,4.549707602339181

8268315,4,B00182FWDO,"This series is touching, but it drags on a bit too long. The first movie can stand alone (Love Comes Softly), the rest just kind of create too much drama. I can understand that life has challenges but really for it to drag on for so long it was a little annoying.
Overall I liked Love Comes Softly. If you can stop with that you will have seen the best.  Unfortunately most people are probably like me and just have a dying itch to scratch and watch the rest in the series. It isn't a waste of time really. They are all enjoyable, just a little tedious at parts.",1225411200,2,562,4.155963302752293
