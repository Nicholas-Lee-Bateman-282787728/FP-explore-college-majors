2933970,4,B000V8ZN3U,"TNA Wrestling The Instant Classic Christian Cage

I really enjoyed this dvd I enjoyed the interview part of it I kind of wish they would do like wwe dvds and interview alot of Christian's fellow wrestlers but it didn't heavily disappoint me. The disappointing thing for me is they do not include what Christian is best at on this dvd and that's his promos. How can you make a dvd for someone who is a king of cutting promos, a master of the mic and not put his greatest TNA promos on it? Whats up with that TNA? Now the matches were pretty good but most all of them except one have been previously released on dvd, here's the match rundown.

Against All Odds February 2006
NWA World Heavyweight Championship
Christian Cage Vs. Jeff Jarrett (C)
This was a good match, I watched it live on pay per view back in February of 06 and I enjoyed it. It was refreshing to see Jeff Jarrett realize how over Cage was and decide to drop the belt to him. The after match celebration was a pretty special moment in TNA wrestling history as well. Rating 4.5/5

Bound For Glory October 2006
8 Mile Street Fight
Christian Vs. Rhino
This was an excellent hardcore match. These 2 guys really put on a good show, the match actually starts outside and works its way into the arena and eventually the ring. The storyline was great too, best friends are now even better enemies. Rating 5/5

TNA Impact November 16 2006
Six Sides Of Steel
Christian Cage Vs. Rhino
This was an awesome match for it being on Impact and not pay per view. This was a good rivalry Rhino and Cage work well against each other. Rating 5/5

TNA Impact November 23 2006
Christian Cage Vs. ""The Icon"" Sting
This match was very short and not as good as it should've been but it did serve it's purpose and that was for Tomko to debut. So I understand why it was put on this dvd. Rating 3/5

Final Resolution January 2007
NWA World Heavyweight Championship
Christian Cage Vs. Sting Vs. Abyss (C)
This was a pretty good match I just wish it could've been a little longer, but the match added more to the Abyss-Sting storyline. Rating 4/5

Against All Odds February 2007
NWA World Heavyweight Championship
Christian Cage (C) Vs. Kurt Angle
This was a good wrestling match and a great main event, the addition of Samoa Joe as the special enforcer helped keep the coalition out of the match. Rating 5/5

Destination X March 2007
NWA World Heavyweight Championship
Christian Cage (C) Vs. Samoa Joe
This was a great wrestling match I would like to see these two wrestle each other a couple more times. Excellent ending. Rating 5/5

I am giving this dvd 4 out of 5 stars and I will recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Christian Cage to go out and get this dvd if you haven't already. If ya don't know now you know, Cause that's how i roll!",1202688000,12,2783,4.388349514563107
2933971,4,B000V8ZN3U,"Christian Cage was someone in the WWF/E who as was part of a tag team revolution during their ""Attitude Era"" and a solid midcard performer who showed the potential & qualifications to be a main eventer but hit the ""glass ceiling"" when it came to getting an opportunity to compete at that level.  So he went to TNA, got that opportunity, and became an ""Instant Classic"".  Now here's his DVD set...one of TNA's best to this day.

One of the big attractions of this DVD would be his interview where he touches on various subjects.  Going up & moving around; his college years & previous jobs including how he was scared of getting his hand cut off at one place; how an injury as a kid helped him became a wrestling fan; how his relationship with edge developed from a toy ninja star; how they broke into the business and eventually met Rhino; his worst injury: the story behind Jim Cornette helping him get into WWF; how he met his wife; his reasoning behind leaving WWE for TNA; favorite TNA moments; and what he wants to do after he retires.  Throughout the interview is where you'll see the archival footage from his independent days as well.

Matches Include:
vs. NWA Champion Jeff Jarrett - Before the match, all night Larry Zbyszko was implying that there would be no outside interference in this match & Earl Hebner would be the official. With those stipulations in place, this wasn't the typical Jarrett match with brawling & non-stop interference until Jarrett wins. These two wrestled with Jeff pulling out every dirty trick he could until Christian finally pulled out the win the end. The celebration was really something to see as all the fans jumped into the ring & hoisted Christian high into the air.
Against All Odds '06

8 Mile Street Fight vs. Rhino - They have the formula of starting outside the building, brawling through backstage, and making it into the ring. Christian was the cocky heel & Rhino was the hometown boy who never quit. This was a great non-stop weapons brawl.
Bound For Glory '06

Barbed Wire Cage Match vs. Rhino - This cage match had various stipulations in that Christian & Rhino had certain objects (key to the cage, bolt cutters, straightjacket, chairs) that were given to them through the cage when they asked for it & the only way to win was escaping the cage. In a nutshell, this was a match that had Christian constantly trying to win the match by escaping while Rhino was more focued on revenge which resulted in Cage being the bloodiest I've ever seen him. Look out for the ending which Mike Tenay put best ""Christian may have won the battle but Rhino won the war.""
""Impact"" Nov. '06
(Best Of The Bloodiest Brawls: Scars & Stitches)

vs. Sting - This match was really nothing special past the debut of Christian's old ""problem solver"" in Tomko.
""Impact"" Nov. '06

vs. NWA Champion Abyss vs. Sting - This was the 3 way rematch from Turning Point however instead of this being a triple threat match (first man to get the fall wins), this was a 3 way dance (both men have to be eliminated to win) with Tomko locked in ringside cage so he wouldn't get involved in the match.  This for the most part had the formula of two men fighting against each other at various times with one guy staying out of the way but this focused more on the story with Abyss & Sting more than anything else as Christian once again regained the NWA Championship.
Final Resolution '07

vs. Kurt Angle - Samoa Joe was the unofficial ringside enforcer for this match to prevent outside involvement from Styles & Tomko.  The other twist here is that Cage kept teasing for weeks that he had a ""consultant"" to help him out against Kurt Angle which was revealed to be Scott Steiner.  This was a match that went back & forth between both men with Christian taking some big punishment like an Olympic Slam into the ringpost & 7 german suplexes in a row at one point.  Again, great match.
Against All Odds' 07

vs. Samoa Joe - With the exception of the Kurt Angle series, Joe's first World Title match saw him & Christian deliver the wrestling clinic that we haven't seen since his X division days. Back & forth action, counter for counter, plenty of nearfalls, and really just kept you on the edge of your set with the ending having you begging for a rematch. This was a definate TNA Match of the year canidate and match of the night.
Destination X '07

DVD extras include a match from early in his independent career against Simon Diamond with commentary by Christian & Diamond, one of his first ever interviews with Edge as part of The Suicide Blondes, and a photo gallery.  You also get a ""MTV Cribs"" view of his house...the same one Abyss beat him up in back in April 2006, which Christian does remind us of from time to time.  You get to see his cars, pet cats, various rooms like his ""dance studio"", and a rare ""Bashin' Brawlers"" plush toys...and if you watch, you'll see why it's a ""Big Sexy"" rare toy.

My title for this review says it all, this was TNA's best efforts put into a DVD set for a superstar. They didn't use the old format where they had just their matches with little clips of an interview inbetween each one & unlike the Sting DVD, footage from his early days in wrestling were used instead of just still photos.  The only downfall for this DVD was the Sting match which was really forgettable just it was a small knick on a DVD that's an ""Instant Classic"" for TNA.  I recommend.",1193529600,3,5412,4.501020408163265
2933972,5,B000V8ZN3U,"Bound for Glory was in Atlanta, so I went to the Fanfest last Saturday and had the option of getting the DVD early. He even signed it, which was really neat.

First the Bonus features on the DVD:
There is an extensive interview from the man, himself. He basically talks about his childhood(where he was born and raised sort of thing), his education(college and what he did with his financial aid money), his jobs, his early days and what got him into wrestling, Edge(Adam Copeland), his injuries from the sport, his marriage, what he does in his spare time, he touches on why he left the WWE and what made him sign with TNA, and he talks about what the future might have for him.

Another cool thing was the tour he gave of his Tampa Bay home much like Cribs.

The Matches:
Against All Odds 2006: Christian Cage vs. Jeff Jarrett(for the NWA world title)- I was glad to see Jarrett put Cage over and drop the belt to him, and the fans reacted appropriately b/c they wanted to see Cage win a major championship. This match was well played and it had the back and forth that made the viewer wonder if Cage was going to win or just be another victim to Jarrett long list of people he coulda or shoulda jobbed to. 8/10

Bound For Glory 2006: 8 Mile Street Fight Cage vs. Rhino
This was a match b/w two former friends and it showed. This match was brutal and hardcore with Cage and Rhino pulling out all the stops. 10/10

Impact Barbed Wire 6 Sides of Steel (Nov. 16, 2006)- Awesome match that is not on a PPV. Cage was simply dominated, but came out victorious due to Rhino spearing Cage through the door. Cage sold the complete obliteration done to the gore through the door. He didn't look much like a winner. 8/10

Impact (Nov. 23, 2006) Cage vs. Sting- I felt this match was not that good and was too short and shouldn't have been included in a Best of Cage DVD. I think Styles vs. AJ Styles would've been better. The only highlight was the debut of Tomko.

Final Resolution 2007: Christian Cage vs. Abyss vs. Sting(NWA Heavyweight title)-Tomko was taken out for most of this match, so Cage had to go it alone for quite some time. Very action packed and I didn't expect Abyss to be the first eliminated setting up a new champion or the fact that Abyss would still help Cage win even though an apparent bond b/w him and Sting was beginning to matieralize. 8.5/10

Against All Odds 2007: Christian Cage vs. Kurt Angle(NWA World Heavyweight Title) Samoa Joe was at ringside to keep people from interfering- This was well fought by both superstars with Angle having the edge due to his mat skills, but Cage made use of every dirty trick in the book. AJ Styles makes an appearance as he just recently joined the coalition. Tomko and Steiner try to interfere with Samoa Joe making the save. It took many Unprettiers to score the victory. 10/10

Destination X 2007: Christian Cage vs. Samoa Joe(NWA World Heavyweight Title)- a great match which had a finish that reminded me of the WM match of Bret Hart and Roddy Piper based on the finish(roll up while in a submission victory) 10/10

I would definitely give this DVD a serious look, b/c it is a good collection of matches, interviews, and tour.

One last thing: All WWE toys and I think a poster were blurred. I thought the Kevin Nash voiced action figure was neat. He really does have a nice house.",1192406400,7,3343,4.437194127243067
2933973,4,B000V8ZN3U,"Christian Cage has always been a favorite wrestler of mine. He's interviews are always a highlight and I was excited to see him get a dvd. He can put on a good match now and again, but I love him in ladder matches. This was before his match with Kaz took place. I hesitated at first because I had all the matches on this set but I bought it anyways. The problems with this set is how Cage does his interviews. He is very laid back and not his energetic self, but then again he is at home and not doing a wrestling show. Overall, the interview segement was very boring. The matches are the only reason to get this set, even though you might have 90% of them.

Christian Cage VS Jeff Jarrett: Wrestling fans wanted Cage as a world champion. He had to leave WWE to do it but it was a huge gain for TNA. Of course Cage would win this match and his first world title. A good match.

VS Rhino in a Eight Mile Street Fight: A generic street fight, and Rhino loses anther hardcore gimmick match. The highlight was it was this match took place in Rhino's home town and the fans reaction after Cage won was priceless.

VS Rhino in a Cage match from Impact: Anther loss for Rhino, but this is the only reason to buy this set.

VS Sting could have been a good match but Tomko debuts and it was on Impact.

VS Abyss VS Sting: The worst triple threat match ive seen in awhile. Hated the ended. Only reason it was added was because it was Cage's second world title win.

VS Kurt ""I ruined TNA"" Angle: A good match. Angle was so much better in WWE but thats anther story.

VS Samoa Joe: This two can put on a hell of a match. Excellent.

I cant really say much. About half of the matches were excellent but the half sucked.

Overall, if your a Cage fan-you own it.",1188691200,,1748,4.117647058823529

8217299,4,B000V8ZN3U,"I thought this dvd was great. In short the documentary could have been longer and there could have been more matches and an extra disc. They were mostly all hits on disc in terms of matches. Cage came into TNA to become the main event star WWE would never allow him despite wins over Shawn Michaels and Chris Jericho he was lost in the shuffle. In TNA he got the chance to prove himself. I remember being so excited when he came. He came around the same time as Sting and you could feel TNA gaining some momentum. It's too bad Cage doesn't look back at TNA with his fondest memories because he did a lot to help that company and made an impact. I think TNA helped him and he helped TNA so it worked out for both sides. My favorite match on the set is the one he has against Jarrett when he beats him winning the title. It was a great match and a defining moment in his career and a big moment for TNA. Christian's matches with Rhino were both awesome as those two being good friends helped make those matches extra good. Those are some of the best matches on the set. There is a match between Cage and Sting which was short but sweet. The three way dance between Cage, Abyss and Sting was a great match in the set. Two of the best matches on the set have Cage defending the title against Joe and Angle. Those matches were both great. I would have liked to see some more matches and a second disc. I think at the time Cage didn't have enough matches to put on there but he had a couple great matches with Monty Brown. I was never crazy about Brown but he had some solid matches with Cage. Cage also had a great match with Abyss. Overall you get almost all his best matches with no filler matches. It's a great dvd I recommend it to all wrestling fans new or old. For TNA fans I think this represents a great time in TNA when there was a lot of excitement they were big names from the WWE defecting to TNA to have awesome matches and young up and coming talent like Samoa Joe stepping right into the mix. Cage had a great run in TNA and this dvd is a good way to remember it and show what an overlooked wrestler Cage was. Enjoy!",1393804800,,2126,4.112980769230769
8217300,2,B000V8ZN3U,"I'm reading several people on here talk about the fact that this is the best TNA ""documentary"" that's been released, and if so, I think that's pretty sad. I've been a fan of Christian since The Brood, and it was actually a Christian ECW match that got me back into wrestling in 2009, for the first time in eight years or so, so he is, hands down, my favorite wrestler. I say all that background so people will understand that I really, really, like Christian... and I still couldn't manage to like this DVD.

I only bridged the TNA gap because I was excited to watch a documentary about Christian, and I was sorely disappointed. I don't know if this is TNA's standard format, but if so, I'm gonna pass on that Kurt Angle release I was looking at. Instead of a two hour documentary, with interviews with both the star and his friends, family, and even rivals, you get Christian, and only Christian, talking to a camera for 40 minutes, giving us some pretty basic info. Given that I love some of the work Christian has done on-mic, I wondered what had happened to Captain Charisma's charisma. He showed no real passion or energy, he just kinda... shot the breeze with the cameraman.

In terms of other special features, we got a Cribs style tour of his house, which did nothing for me. We also got an ancient Suicide Blondes promo, which was pretty cool, while also being pretty awful- but hey, they were still kids playing in front of a camera, more or less. The high point in the special features was a match between Christian and Simon Diamond from ages and ages ago, with the wrestlers involved doing a voice-over commentary. This part, at least, was pretty entertaining.

Finally, we are left with the matches. I don't really have much to say here. I thought they were all pretty uninspiring. There were some sorta kinda cool spots, but somehow I just didn't really feel the energy I get from WWE matches. I don't know if it was a difference in the production values, or some difference in the timing of the matches, but I actually got bored enough watching the match segment that I was just waiting for them to be over so I could go watch a Christian match from his ECW title run.

Overall, I think some of my issues may just come from missing the flashier production values WWE is able to put into their products, but I was woefully unimpressed with this DVD. I guess I'll have to wait till Christian retires, and hope WWE FINALLY gives him some kind of DVD release then...",1388707200,,2478,4.487804878048781
8217301,5,B000V8ZN3U,"CHRISTIAN CAGE
THE INSTANT CLASSIC

I really like Christian and was one of those people who always thought he was getting screwed over in WWE before he jumped to TNA. So I am sure you can all tell that I was very excited by his coming to TNA. At the time it was the biggest thing to happen to them in a while. I loved his time in TNA and to be honest I was a little upset that he left. But before all of that TNA produced this DVD. We get some matches of course but it is the interview and special features that make this great. The interview is excellent and you find out all kinds of things about him. This of course includes how he met Edge and why he left the WWE. You also get a match between him and Simon Diamond from their indie days with them providing commentary. But one of my favorite things about this set is the ""cribs"" like segment as he gives a tour of his house, just a fun little bonus.

1.[WORLD TITLE]VS JEFF JARRETT-the first match on this set is the only one in which Cage is the face. This was a pretty good match even with the typical Double J antics of the time, which includes the guitar shot. Both guys do well here and the crowd gets very into it more and more as the match goes on. Christian was very much the fan favorite here as the ending showcases after he finally wins a World title [NWA]. The fans rush into the ring as Rhino raises Cage into the air. This match took place at ""Against All Odds"" 2006.

2.[8 MILE STREET FIGHT]VS RHINO-taking place in Rhino's home town of Detroit at ""Bound for Glory"" 2006 this is the first match featuring Cage as a heel. This is a brutal match with both guys getting beaten with multiple weapons. I liked how this match started outside and made its way into the building and eventually to the ring. The home town boy loses this one but it was a really fun match.

3.[SIX SIDES OF STEEL]VS RHINO-this was a rematch that occurred on Impact that year inside the six sides of steel, with barbed wire across the top of the cage. There were added bonuses to this match like they had to ask for the key or could get bolt cutters and even a straight jacket, which you may remember from the previous match. In all honesty from the way these guys performed together and it being a cage match I think this could have easily been a PPV bout. Like the last this is violent and Cage even gets busted open, wide open. The ending occurs when Rhino ""gores"" Christian to the outside breaking open the cage, there Cage escaped the cage and wins.

4. VS STING-this match happened a week after that cage match on the next Impact. This was a good match and was a fitting one for the weekly TV show but I think a better match could have been put on this set. I get that they put this here to showcase the storyline and the debut of Tomko, this sets up the storyline that lead to the next match on the set.

5.[WORLD TITLE]VS ABYSS VS STING-this match came about because Cage and Sting did not settle who was next in line for a shot at Abyss's title. This was a triple threat elimination match that is more fun than anything. The action is good here and has the typical three way battles going on in it. The champ Abyss is the first eliminated which kinda surprised me at the time. This leaves Cage and Sting to do battle while Tomko is locked up in a cage. After a nice back and forth Christian regains his World Title. This match took place at Final Resolution 2007.

6.[WORLD TITLE]VS KURT ANGLE-this was an excellent match and very worthy of any DVD collection. This was for Christian's title and Angle brought it from the very beginning. Both men looked great here but Kurt was all over Cage, even hitting seven German suplexes in a row. Also at ringside was Samoa Joe to keep Christian's crew from getting involved. Now while he was successful Cage still gets the win in a very hard fought match.

7.[WORLD TITLE]VS SAMOA JOE-another excellent match and how could it not be with these two guys. Anytime one of these two or Kurt wrestles one another it usually equals greatness. This is another highly competitive contest with constant back and forth with the edge going to Joe. The finish to this match is excellent that like one review I have read said is reminiscent of the Bret Hart/Roddy Piper Mania 8 finish. This one has a bit of a twist on it that makes it great, Christian retains the belt.

This is a great set and if you come across it I say pick it up. It is one of the better TNA DVD releases they have focusing on an individual.",1370304000,,4493,4.257913247362251

8217303,4,B000V8ZN3U,This is a pretty decent collection of some of Christians career in tna. I wouldve preferred more of his time there as a heel included on the disc since I feel he was more entertaing at that time. If you're a fan of his it's worth picking up.,1302912000,,241,4.041666666666667

Rhino impressed me here with his intensity. He was way over with the crowd due to it being in Michigan. Christian picked up the intensity as well at the end of the match when it took all he had to pin Rhino to the mat. 4/5

Some of the bonus features here are invaluable such as:

* Edge and Christian as the Suicide Blondes cutting a brutal promo.

* Simon Diamond and Christian doing hilarious mock-commentary on one of their old matches from way back when in Pennsylvania.

* A look at the Reso home (Christian's house). He takes you through his palace and man cave and it's a real treat hearing his stories and anecdotes.
