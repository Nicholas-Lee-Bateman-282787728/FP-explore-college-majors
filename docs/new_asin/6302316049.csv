7824818,5,6302316049,"Where No One Has Gone Before is a dazzling episode with amazing special effects and a great story of a travler from far away coming as a assistant with a ""expert"" warp field consultant, then accidently sending the Enterprise hearlding through galaxies and systems at an unchartable speed. And the expert taking the credit. But it was really the travler's doing and now he's dying. He is the only one how can get them home. This was a episode that was very exciting and wonderful. A gem in a other wise, weak first season.",1106092800,,521,4.553191489361702
7824819,4,6302316049,"The Enterprise is to be the subject of an experiment. An arrogant Starfleet propulsion expert comes on board with his alien assistant, claiming to be able to boost the output of the ship's engines. Even though his formulas appear to be nonsense, Picard rather tartly consents to the test, over the objections of his crew. They certainly get more than they expected, being propelled millions of light years beyond their goal. Everyone puts it down to a malfunction, but only Wesley Crusher understands that it was somehow the result of the actions of the expert's assistant.
 That assistant is the only one who can return them, but in the first attempt, they enter a nether region where thoughts can become reality and the assistant, who is actually a ""Traveler"", grows sick and is on the verge of dying.  Nevertheless, by marshalling all their thoughts, the crew of the Enterprise provides enough assistance to the Traveler so that they are able to return to their own galaxy.
  This is the episode where Wesley Crusher makes the transition from ""the boy"" to Ensign Crusher. At the start, Picard and Riker refer to him as the boy, to the point where he has to remind them that his name is Wesley. Picard is also much more rigid in this episode than in others, until the end when he ""promotes"" Wesley, he is unwilling to accept dissent, cutting off all who try to explain circumstances to him.
 Like some of the other early episodes, the principals are rigid and overly authoritative in their behavior. In my opinion, one of the primary reasons why the quality improves in later episodes is that the main characters become much less rigid in their actions, no doubt due in part to the actors adjusting to their roles. This episode is not one of the best, I rank it right in the middle of the group. It is most memorable for the fact that Wesley becomes a full member of the crew, opening up many plot possibilities for future episodes.",1072310400,,1934,4.659824046920821

The U.S.S. Enterprise and crew bring aboard a cocky warp engines mechanic and his assistant to do tests on the starships new warp engines and even more.
The U.S.S. Enterprise has intercepted the U.S.S. Fearless and brings aboard a cocky warp engines mechanic named Kosinski and his assistant on board the Enterprise.
They head to Engineering and begin the first test, with the Enterprise going at warp 1.5. The assistant does a mistake and begins to dematerialize in the engine room. After that, the Enterprise goes into super-warp, going past warp 10. On the viewscreen, quasars and pulsars go flying past the Enterprise. Picard orders the starship to come to a full stop. The starship Enterprise ends up in a different galaxy than their own. La Forge calculates that the Enterprise has ended up on the far side of the Triangulum Galaxy, also known as M-33 and they left their own galaxy and passed two other ones. Picard asks Data how far they have traveled. Data says that the Enterprise has gone 2,700,000 light-years from their former position. Thats impossible! La Forge calculates that it will take the starship three centuries even at their fastest speed. Kosinski explains what happened to the Enterprise when they were in warp.
Picard asks Kosinski to do the same thing as before to get back to the galaxy they live in, and Kosinski agrees and heads back to the Engine Room. They do it again and the assistant begins dematerializing again and this time Riker sees what is happening to the ship. The Enterprise goes into super-warp and suddenly, disappears from the Triangulum Galaxy. The starship starts to shake violently. They stop again, and they aren't in their galaxy but in another strange one. Picard asks what the place is called.  Data says for his friend, Where none have gone before. The U.S.S. Enterprises present position is at least over a billion light-years from their own galaxy. Picard heads to the Engine Room and sees the alien dying.  Later, in Sickbay, the alien calls himself a traveler. The reason the Enterprise is in this galaxy because the warp formula had thought in it. He also tells him that Wesley is special and must get the best attention like Mozart, the famous composer of the 17th and 18th centuries. As Picard tries to get to the Bridge, a crewman is thinking of fire and is trapped. Picard tells the crewman to put it out in his thoughts. It works, and he continues his duties.  Picard talks to the crew to think of the Traveler or his or her duty, it might be enough to get the crew back to the Milky Way Galaxy.
Picard puts the starship on Red Alert and gets ready to go back to the Milky Way Galaxy. Counselor Troi and Lt. Yar tell Picard that there will be stress and general fear by the crew. Picard orders La Forge to set a retroactive course to get back to the Milky Way Galaxy, and The Enterprise goes to warp speed. They are getting faster and it is not enough yet. Whats worse, is that the alien is trying to dematerialize again. It was enough, and the alien disappears. Whats also great, is that the Enterprise is back in the Alpha Quadrant and back in their galaxy.
La Forge calls this trip through the universe a sleigh ride. Captain Picard summons Wesley and has been commissioned Acting Ensign Until Starfleet Academy can accept him. He is greatly pleased and accepts the offer.
This is my favourite TNG first season episode.",1058054400,,3442,4.68595041322314
7824821,5,6302316049,"First Appearance of the Traveler
In this Next Generation classic; an engineering quack by the name of ""Kosinski"" claims he can upgrade the warp engine efficiency.  The information turns out to be nonsense. It's the assistant; ""The Traveler"" who is behind the discovery.  It turns out this alien can bend space and time.  After a warp experiment, the Enterprise speeds to a dimension where ""none have gone before"". It's too bad they didn't see what species lived in this strange place.  The Traveler notices Wesley Crusher.  He tells Wes that he has a talent for bending dimensional reality as he does. It can be developed; if only he allows himself to.
This episode marks the first time the Enterprise journeys to somewhere other than conventional ""space.""  There is a terrific special effects sequence. When the big E travels beyond space and time; via the Traveler, and not because of Kosinski's ""Genius."" The scenes between Wesley and the alien make this one a standout from the rest.",978739200,,987,4.9156626506024095
