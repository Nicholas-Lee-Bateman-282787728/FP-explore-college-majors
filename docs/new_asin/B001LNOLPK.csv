8318955,5,B001LNOLPK,"The professional critics don't really like this movie. I love it. Gorgeous Rosanna Schiaffino(passed away in 2009-RIP) would be sexy wearing a tent.

In this 1966 movie, she is a elderly witch that temporarily becomes young again by killing domestic cats. She bewitches men that interest her. These men become captives in a crumbling Rome mansion. One finally breaks free of the witch's spell.

Atmospheric with beautiful black and white photography. A very risque seduction scene for 1966. Highly recommended!",1280966400,,510,5.3625
