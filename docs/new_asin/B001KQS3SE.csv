8315875,5,B001KQS3SE,"I bought this video for my father.  He worked at Lockheed during WWII and assembled B-17's (along with Venturas, P-38s and various other warbirds).  Yes, I know that the B-17 was a Boeing plane--but during the war, the country made good use of ALL relevant manufacturing facilities and there was a lot of 'sharing' of intellecutal property.

Dad loved the video.  Given that 'he was there', I took that as high praise.",1371859200,12,418,4.763888888888889
