8176298,1,B000NA6DLC,"Anytime one can introduce even the most basic art history ideas to children I get excited! I was greatly disappointed to view this old school approach - especially in an era where technology is at our fingertips and can liven up even the most dull things. This was slow, boring, tedious....and I enjoy art history! I would not show this to my students for fear of making them dislike art history. Off to find another art history piece as I will not be using this one...ever.",1391299200,4,474,4.523255813953488
8176299,1,B000NA6DLC,"I bought the DVD version for our children hoping that they would learn to appreciate art history and understand art trends that have impacted culture throughout history.  Boy, was I disappointed.  The DVD says it is intended for children age 5 through 11.  However, the author, Patricia Robinson, delivers her lectures in this DVD by talking about art in a dry and erudite manner.  I did not want lectures but rather a compilation of major art works throughout history with a trend emerging from the presentation.  Clearly this was not the case.",1232409600,9,545,4.880434782608695
