4553007,4,B0053YNEK6,The DVD arrived only after 2 weeks here in Australia and it worked just fine. The children really enjoyed it as it was packed with action and good humour. The story line was good and it had a few twists to make it interesting. Altogether a great DVD that children would enjoy.,1317772800,3,276,4.326923076923077

4553014,5,B0053YNEK6,I really enjoyed this movie. Not to say it was perfect or had the largest budget but I still loved it.,1456876800,2,102,3.9047619047619047
4553015,2,B0053YNEK6,"Maybe you've had a long day at work and want to relax when you get home. You're thinking pizza and an action movie but you're wife's thinking something with a little bit of romance. You compromise and decide to watch this. . . bad decision. You're still tired from work but are now also troubled because you've had your eyes and ears assaulted with everything that you saw in the movie. . . plus the pizza gave you gas. Next time choose something better. You won't regret it.

(I actually thought the book was okay but this big-screen adaptation isn't exactly a masterpiece. The acting could be better, the script could flow better, the special effects were lacking and it overall I was just ""underwhelmed."" It's not the worst thing to ever hit the big screens, but don't expect to be blown away.)",1453766400,,797,4.573426573426573
4553016,3,B0053YNEK6,Kind of boring.,1453075200,,15,4.333333333333333
4553017,4,B0053YNEK6,"great family movie, needs a longer ending though .... never followed up with their family services case. you would think they would show the father regaining custody after finding out hes still alive. they never did leaves a big hole at the end especially since there was no sequel.",1447891200,2,282,4.775510204081633
4553018,1,B0053YNEK6,"This was recommends based on some other films such as Mythica. Those films were good, this one was lousy.  Too many plots, too poorly developed, cheesy acting.",1445644800,,159,4.888888888888889
4553019,1,B0053YNEK6,Not at all that I expected it to be. It is on the borderline of a childish B movie. It was just not my forte. But children will probably find it amusing.. Just my opinion.,1438041600,,171,3.914285714285714
4553020,5,B0053YNEK6,Wonderful!!  I really love movies like this and actress Summer Naomi Smart is fantastic.  I loved her in Belle and the Beast and I love her here.  I wish that she was in more films - such a great actress.  I loved how they did the whole otherworld within a world theme.  I love to read books like this so it was great to see this in a movie.  Completely family friendly!!!!!  It is so hard to find films like this nowadays.  Such a great film to watch!!!,1437436800,2,454,4.079545454545454
4553021,4,B0053YNEK6,"Very nice storyline. Well acted, and great production values for an independent film. Thanks Chris!",1436140800,2,99,5.666666666666667
4553022,3,B0053YNEK6,Not a bad movie at all for lower budget movie.,1434240000,,46,3.7
4553023,3,B0053YNEK6,"If you have patience, it is like a Mormon church play turned into a film with limited production values and mixed acting abilities. The leading man's wig is a little distracting. They would have been better off to just let him have short hair. It was kind of interesting as a non-Mormon to get a peek into their belief that the lost tribes ended up in North America and created a flourishing civilization despite any evidence in the physical record. This film if anything makes the idea even more ridiculous. But all that said, It works as a family film if you want to get your kids curious about Mormon doctrine and the final message of the film (quite literally) is ""read and study the Book"".",1431216000,2,694,4.515873015873016
4553024,4,B0053YNEK6,"I wish they would make movies of the Tennis Shoes among the Nephites series; it is better written and the characters are more fully developed.  Nevertheless, this is worth watching.  The religion wasn't a big part of the movie, but if you are ultra-sensitive to anything not sanctioned by the liberal media, stay away.  Personally, I like watching movies that show a little about different cultures and religions.  It opens your mind and helps you understand people who are misrepresented by the popular media in general.  If you are open-minded, I also recommend the movie, ""Arranged.""  It is beautifully done and shows what can happen when people ignore society prejudice and get to know each other in person.  There's a lot to be said for turning off the news and learning from the people themselves what they are really like.  There is so much good in the bad of us, and so much bad in the good of us, that it behooves none of us to judge the other.
Relax and enjoy a great fantasy that the whole family can watch together.",1429920000,2,1027,4.604395604395604
4553025,4,B0053YNEK6,"Great story with some added humor as a bonus, which both my teenagers appreciated. My daughter commented the whole way through about how the special effects were ""so fake"" and that she thought the story line was weird; but she was totally glued to it the whole time and even cried at the end! So give it a chance!",1426636800,2,313,4.322033898305085
4553026,5,B0053YNEK6,My grandaughter whose is 8 years old loved this movie in fact we watched it twice. It is a beautifully written story and a wonderful love story,1422144000,2,143,4.333333333333333
4553027,4,B0053YNEK6,Loved this story.  Wish they would do more of these movies.,1419811200,3,59,4.363636363636363
4553028,5,B0053YNEK6,I had seen this movie before and I felt a need to own it.,1418169600,,57,3.142857142857143
4553029,1,B0053YNEK6,"Mormon fantasy, poorly acted, script written by a three year old, not worth the one star but they don't go lower.",1414454400,3,113,4.428571428571429
4553030,5,B0053YNEK6,Good entertainment for the evening,1410566400,2,34,6.0
4553031,1,B0053YNEK6,"This movie was terrible. I saw in other reviews that it has something to do with the Book of Mormon, that may be part of the reason for some of the better reviews. This movie would receive a C at best in a high school introductory to film class. I have to disclose I did not make it for the last twenty minutes. If you are looking to watch a movie tonight, save yourself and pick something else.",1407974400,,395,4.076923076923077
4553032,5,B0053YNEK6,My children enjoyed this movie. They talked about it for days and days. It is a nice clean family film.,1402704000,3,103,4.2
4553033,5,B0053YNEK6,"We found this movie very entertaining! I love movies that take you to a different dimension of time, like journey to the center of the earth and back to the future. This was great to see with Book of Mormon characters and tribes. Great Movie!",1381968000,4,242,4.4
4553034,5,B0053YNEK6,"Good movie, Little corny in the beginning but really comes to life after.
Good effects and a good inside look at past time.",1378857600,2,123,4.391304347826087
4553035,1,B0053YNEK6,"the acting was second rate, plot was even shallower the only reference to zarahemla was a time traveler, saying Zarahemla is over that hill. It involved  some modern juveniles travelling across an imaginary line in the forest to a time bout  thosand years ago, after stealing a car to get to an aunt in utah to avoid being sent to a foster home
Very lousy movie, should be removed from the shelves. I asked for a refund from shipper and told too bad so threw movie in the trash",1355097600,4,477,4.348314606741573
4553036,3,B0053YNEK6,Very fun movie to watch as a family!!!  I read the book first and then watched the movie.  The movie stayed real with the story and they did a very good job with a low budget.,1341187200,2,175,3.8333333333333335
4553037,5,B0053YNEK6,This movie is one of the best I have seen in a long time. The acting is great and the entertainment value makes this a must see. Chris Heimerdinger is a great writer and I love his work. This movie made me want to read the second book and now I can't wait for it to go to film.,1338508800,4,277,3.711864406779661

8455949,5,B0053YNEK6,"My kids and I  love this movie - we had rented it before -  and they had been asking to see it again . I  ordered it from the seller FrostCave Heimerdinger, not realizing that I was ordering it from the  author himself! I  was surprised and pleased to receive it in a timely order, and discover that he had signed it for me. That was much more than I had expected!  Thanks Chris for the signed DVD and for the prompt delivery!  I will be happy to order from you again!",1512000000,,468,4.021739130434782
8455950,5,B0053YNEK6,"Very fun film.  Pretty good acting from main characters. I'll probably watch it again. The Lamanites were scary looking, but hilarious!",1502496000,2,135,5.428571428571429
