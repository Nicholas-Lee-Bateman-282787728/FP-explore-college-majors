612658,3,6303269834,tommy lee jones and susan surandon are awesome actors! together they sizzle!,928713600,,76,5.416666666666667
612659,5,6303269834,"This is a very enjoyable movie. The actors are all from the first class (Susan Sarandon, Tommy Lee Jones, Brad Renfro, from Apt Pupil, Mary-Louise Parker, from Fried Green Tomatoes, J.T. Walsh, from Breakdown, Will Patton  from Armaggedon, Anthony Edwards, from E.R. What else could U want?). The  film never gets boring, the tension never ends, the story is intelligent  and very beliveble. Although the director is the same as the one who worked  on Batman and Robin years after, THIS film is far, far, far and REALLY far  better. I have watched this movie about 3 or 4 times, and I allways can  watch it again. I loved this film so much, that I'm pretending to read the  book from John Grisham, but I'm worried the book isn't so worth than the  movie",916704000,,753,4.567164179104478

612747,5,6303269834,I have watched this movie so many times its amazing I love it so much.  It's better than the book in some cases...but that's because of the three lead actors.,1521417600,,158,4.266666666666667
612748,5,6303269834,I wasn't impressed with this one. The story is a bit fragmented. It does depict a fantasy sense of justice. I don't feel that it was either Sarandon's or Lee Jones best roles.,1520899200,,175,4.333333333333333

612754,1,6303269834,Well I seem to be one of the odd ducks here but I think this movie sucks.  To me every one of the actors are whores.  The movie is LOOSELY based on the book and John Grisham should have his pocket book examined for letting this be made into a movie.  And I hope Grisham reads this at some time.  Sad.,1516492800,,300,3.8688524590163933

612927,4,6303269834,The Client is a fine movie about the burearcracy of the Justice system. I haven't seen it in a long time. Its a good lawyer thriller of the 90s.

613453,5,6303269834,"Having read the book, I think this film is a good job.  It various from the book of course, because the story has to be compressed into 90 minutes or so, but the screen writer did a good job at not destroying the intentions and plot and characters that John Grisham, the book author, presented in his book.  The only think I think is wrong is that the boy is supposed to be only 11 years old: from the way the kid performs, I think he would have to be older than that.  Also the actor for that part looks to be 14 years old or so.  Apparently the casting director doesn't have any children!!",1444694400,,591,4.113043478260869

Of course too many of Grisham's recent books sound like a man trying to meet a deadline while the family is in the car waiting to go out to dinner.  Not even the incredible story ""The Firm"" was untouched in this manner.  But The Client is close and it shows in the opening scene with the terrified mob lawyer killing himself and setting in motion the festivities.  And why should I need to go on and on about an obviously good movie.  Now, how about ""The Brethren"" and ""The Testament"" ?  Or better yet, why doesn't someone do the obviously right thing and make a movie based on Jimmy Buffet's ""Where Is Joe Merchant?"" ?",1429488000,,763,4.375886524822695

613659,4,6303269834,"The Sway brothers come from a single parent home, one that is so poor, that they have to be left unsupervised. Often times, they go exploring in the woods behind their trailer, but on this particular day, they run into another person, a man intent on killing himself. When young Mark (Brad Renfro) interferes, the man takes him prisoner and before taking his own life, he opens up to the boy about some things he never should have told anyone. Mark calls the police and ultimately lies to them, the way any kid would, but they know it and when the FBI comes into the investigation, the smart twelve year old decides it's time for him to go out and find a lawyer. It took me a long time to watch this film because as a fan of John Grisham, I prefer to read his books before I see his films. As is the case in the Client, a lot of those films are directed by Joel Shumacher, who remains true to the story and produces a tremendous movie. After a nationwide search, Brad Renfro was selected to star in the first role of his brief, but brilliant career. Renfro unfortunately died of a drug overdose fourteen years later, but was well on his way to becoming a superstar. Even in his very first performance, you could see that this kid had what it takes to star in a film like this and really held his own with the all-star cast. Here he's paired with Susan Sarandon, who despite her reputation is often times someone I find unimpressive. She can be fantastic, but rarely seems to fit the roles she's cast in, but not here. As Mark's lawyer, Reggie Love, Sarandon portrays one of her most interesting characters to date and gives a flawless performance. The Client is a story written by one of America's favorite novelists, and what makes Grisham's stories so good is the fact that he is a lawyer, so everything is accurate as well as exciting. Together with a terrific cast, the Client had all the action, twists, and turns a fantastic court room drama should have. This story may have been a little more out there than some of Grisham's other films, nevertheless it is still a film that will hold your interest and keep you on the edge of your seat.",1422144000,,2145,4.405541561712846

Second the part where Mark storms into Reggie's office and following his line ""I'm not talking to the FBI today"", instead of looking tough and determined, he's looking at her with a soft puppy dog look. Third, in regards to dialogue, people in the south usually call their parents Mama and Daddy. Not mom or mother and father.

I was really looking forward to FINALLY seeing this movie but can't say I was all that impressed. The acting for the most part was ok but it certainly isn't one of my fav. Grisham films to date. The Rainmaker is my absolute favorite in that regard, I just LOVED that movie from start to finish.

spoiler alert!!!

I can't really pinpoint why I didn't like this film but it just didn't grab and hold my attention throughout.

A couple of things were rather unbelievable too such as: how the young boy got his heart revved up fast enough to get transported to the hospital as an emergency case.

Why he would be left in a big, for the most part unguarded cellblock all alone, when his life was in serious danger.

And the trip to the boathouse in the middle of the night to find the body seemed far fetched too.

I hope there are more Grisham movies and books to come soon. I would love to see: The Street Lawyer or The Litigators made into movies.

Hopefully they will be a LOT better movies  than The Client was.",1410307200,,1027,4.307291666666667

613870,4,6303269834,"While not in the same league as The Rainmaker, this adaptation of John Grisham's novel of the same name is certainly not to be ignored.  In his acting debut, Brad Renfro shines as a young boy in Tennessee who, along with his little brother, witnesses a man's suicide, but not before the man discloses his reasons for taking his own life, reasons that the U.S. Attorney's Office is very interested in.  Wanting to protect himself and his family, the young boy recruits a local attorney, played by Susan Sarandon, to help him stay out of trouble for not telling what he knows as some mobsters have already threatened him into keeping his silence.  I do wonder why, in the book or the film, everyone either bends or is bent to the will of this kid, who is basing all of his brilliant decisions on stuff he's seen on TV.  If anything, this plot point should serve as a lesson to parents about monitoring the stuff your offspring sees on the screen.  I know he was threatened, but the kid, and more importantly, his lawyer, should have brought that to the attention of the U.S. Attorney who, if he so badly wanted that information, would have then bent over backwards twice to ensure protection.  The man may be an ambitious, self-serving annoyance, all qualities properly portrayed by Tommy Lee Jones in this film, but he'd surely do anything to preserve his case, and the witnesses in front of him.  But if this ""kid genius"" wasn't the main character, we wouldn't have this plot point, or the story for that matter, to begin with.  Regardless of this glaring problem, which cost this film a star in my rating, it was still well-acted and well-paced.  While certain things in the book were changed, some might have been for the better given that books and movies are different media and others didn't hurt the story.  It's a solid film and one of the better adaptations of John Grisham's work, right behind ""The Rainmaker"", ""A Time to Kill"", ""The Firm"", and tied with ""Runaway Jury"".  Enjoy.",1403049600,,1987,4.632478632478633
613871,3,6303269834,"Nice story, but the motivations of the characters were askew and hard to get a handle on.  The kid has witnessed a death and has information the authorities need to solve a crime, but he is scared of reprisal and doesn't want to testify, so his goal through the story is NOT to have to do something rather than struggling for a positive change.  He retains a lawyer whose primary goal is to keep the kid from having to cooperate with the authorities, to NOT bring about justice but rather avoid it.  Meanwhile, the prosecutors, FBI, and other ""good guys"" are portrayed as self-serving, lying, scheming bad guys as they try to force the kid to tell what he knows, which puts Justice on the side of wrong.  As for the resolution, I won't spoil the ending except to say that all the kid ever had to do was cooperate with the authorities in the first place and save himself a whole movie's worth of unnecessary trouble.  As the story is, the world is exactly the same after all the struggle as it would have been if there had been no struggle at all, which makes the story unsatisfying.",1403049600,,1082,4.417085427135678

613874,4,6303269834,"The Client is a slick thriller and another one of the better adaptations of a John Grisham novel after The Pelican Brief was shown into the big screen. It is based on the bestselling novel that tells a story of a street-wise kid, Mark Sway, sees the suicide of Jerome Clifford, a prominent Louisiana lawyer, whose current client is Barry 'The Blade' Muldano, a Mafia hit-man who killed Senator Boyd Boyette. Mark's brother is traumatized into a coma by the incident and he runs in desperation arriving at the office of Reggie Love,a recovering alcoholic lawyer. With the Mob trying to kill them and a ruthless federal attorney trying to force Mark to reveal what he knows, Love battles to guarantee the safety of her young client and his family.

While the film isn't really a great one considering that it is formulaic and one already knows what will eventually happen to Reggie and her client,it is still worth watching considering it had its moments of tension and suspense. At the same time,we get to see great performances particularly Susan Sarandon as Reggie,who was able to show redemption from being an alcoholic to someone who can provide protection and safety to her young client. At the same time,she was able to manifest great relationship with her young client Mark that the viewer can definitely relate to.",1401840000,,1321,4.845132743362832

The cast is superb, with Brad Renfro firing the first, brilliant flare in a career that should have outshone James Dean in its trajectory, and Susan Sarandon and Tommy Lee Jones at their best, in roles that would formulate their stereotypes and define their depth. The plot was uniquely uncomplicated but sufficiently intricate. And, best of all, it carried with it the satisfaction of seeing a spectrum of good triumphing over a variety of evils, delivered with an elegantly broad span of humor and dark drama",1400544000,2,660,4.798245614035087

However, while in high school, I read the book, and was glued to it. It was the only book I've ever read that I actually lost myself in. Time just whizzed by as I read it. Then I found out there was a movie, so I just had to get it on DVD.

When I watched the DVD, that's when I realized that I had already seen bits and pieces of it. Finally, several years later, I find there's a Bluray version of the movie and I just had to snatch it up.

There's nothing special about the movie itself. It's the same as the DVD, just better quality, however, I won't deny that it was disappointing that it was pretty much a 'port' from DVD to Bluray. It had no different special features from the DVD, even though by watching the 'Trailer' there were obviously deleted scenes that could have been added. Really a waste of Bluray disc since they didn't take advantage of the space Bluray discs have. But I'm still happy to have this movie in HD.",1393545600,,1087,4.221153846153846

for 'The Client', so I went to my local library and put my name on the waiting list.  I finally got it, showed it to my husband, who
is not a book reader.  He loved it!  Seven days later, sadly I had to return it to the public library.

I thought about how much I wanted to see it again and went on Amazon to find it.  Low and behold, there it was, so I placed my
order.  It is supposed to arrive on Monday, Jan. 13th, but I knew, hands down, I could write my review now.  I just had to include it in my DVD collection of favorite 'all time' movies!

I would recommend 'The Client' to anyone who loves a good murder mystery!  Thanks for having it it stock Amazon,

614139,2,6303269834,"A mob lawyer commits suicide (first tries via carbon monoxide in an isolated area where two boys are playing, then succeeds via 'eating a bullet') because he fears a mob enforcer will murder him for knowing where to find the body of one of their victim. A 9-year-old boy prevents the first attempts by removing the hose, is grabbed by the mob lawyers, and barely escapes after forced into the car while the CO2 poisoning continues. But not before he's also told the location of the body. His brother goes comatose after they return home (PTSD), the FBI wants to talk to the older boy (witness), and he defies them after hiring a lawyer. Eventually it's all sorted out, but not before one will check every other channel out for something better.

The film is extremely unrealistic for several reasons: 1)Why should the lawyer kill himself to avoid being killed? 2)Prolonged coma is not a symptom of PTSD. 3)The nine-year boy continually acts like one 29 with more knowledge of the legal system than most adults. 4)One cannot take the 5th to avoid being questioned as a witness, as he did. 5)The boy's actions, supported by his attorney, were totally senseless - they could have immediately removed any threat from the mob by telling the FBI where the original body was stashed, allowing the FBI to quickly pick up the entire gang.",1387238400,,1329,4.728448275862069

It doesn't have its own identity, but instead feels like a variation of the same.  Still, the cast is very strong, especially Susan Sarandon, who manages to unearth a great shade of character and backstory to create someone moving and memorable.

614491,5,6303269834,"Last night's bargain-rack movie was ""The Client."" I found it on the five-dollar shelf at a nearby Wal-Mart. It's quite a good movie. The story has to do with two young trailer-trash boys who inadvertently become witnesses to the suicide of a mob lawyer. Before the suicide, one of the boys has personal contact with the lawyer. The lawyer was involved in the murder of a senator and the boys were hunted down with the idea that they might have knowledge of the location of the body. One of the boys is in a coma as a result of the traumatic experience. The other (Brad Renfro) is relentlessly pursued until he hires a lawyer (Susan Sarandon) for a  dollar and she steps in to protect his rights and look out after his safety. Thus, he becomes ""The Client"" of the movie title.

It's an interesting story with a lot of twists and turns and will probably hold your attention with little difficulty. It provides an interesting perspective on the legal system, especially as it might apply to children. The acting of Sarandon and Renfro is excellent, and the supporting cast backs them up well. The movie is nicely filmed and directed. I'd regard it as a fairly fast-moving, fairly thrilling and very interesting movie.

Mark gets involved because everyone suspects he knows things about the lawyer he's not telling. He manages to contact Susan Sarandon, a lawyer in recovery from some very hard times indeed.

What a mess! How will they ever get out of this? Like I said before, John Grisham loves to write about smart people, and these two seemingly fragile people add up to one smart team.

614546,4,6303269834,"One of the strongest messages of the film is the idea that those without resources are vulnerable indeed to just about everything that can happen.

It opens with two unsupervised young boys sneaking off to try to give themselves the cigarette habit after their too-young mother goes off to work.  She is barely out of sight before they burst from the old trailer and make off to the river where the older boy lights them both up after giving a suitable big brother lecture about the way a habit must be managed.  As they sit there smoking, up comes a big black auto with a suicidal Mob lawyer who knows his career is over and sets up a rubber hose from the exhaust into the cab.  The oldest boy knows this will kill the guy so he sneaks up and pulls out the hose.  The Mobster is disappointed in the results, checks the exhaust and mutters something about lousing everything up again.  He reconnects the hose and gets back in his car.  Repeat.  This time, he sees the kid in the rearview mirror.  He catches him in the act of removing the hose again, forces him into the car and, since he is planning to do himself in anyway, gets it all off his chest and tells the boy everything he needs to know to become a prime hit target of the Bosses; detailing the whacking of a senator who probably reneged on a deal he made with them, and the location of the body.  All sorts of things happen next; his little brother is traumatized by the sight of the suicide, their mother loses her job over it, what can go wrong does.

Enter the cops, the FBI and Susan Sarandon, who takes the kid's case after he sneaks into her office to find help.  Tommy Lee Jones in his role as the brilliant FBI man, is TommyLeeJonesesque and that's always OK with me.  Susan Sarandon is the very pro bono lawyer with a cause - a kid who will surely be killed if he is not handled right in the system.  Court room sparring, sleazy questioning without miranda rights, and a midnight sortie into a New Orleans swamp in search of the body all are woven into this tale of juvenile justice and adult crime.  The plot is fast moving, interesting and well written with catchy dialog.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.",1328918400,,2171,4.349875930521092
614547,3,6303269834,"The Client, 1994 film

Two boys wander off into the woods to smoke a cigarette, then hide when a car drives up. They watch as a hose is connects the exhaust to a car window. One boy disconnects the hose, but the man in the car revives and captures him. He tells Mark why he wants to die (he knows too much). The boys get away. Back in New Orleans we see Barry ""the blade"" in action. The police find the body in that car, and the boys in the woods. Young Ricky suffers from shock and stress. There is a missing state senator, his body can't be found. Mark's fingerprints were in that car! Mark goes to find a lawyer and tells what he saw. The FBI questions Mark. Does he need a lawyer? Reggie Love shows up to question the FBI. There is a surprise! A reporter shows up at the charity hospital with a camera. That private investigator meets Mark and questions him. That night a masked man threatens Mark if he talks to anyone!

We learn why that missing state senator was in trouble (he took money but didn't deliver). Reggie stands up for Mark. Can the FBI take Mark into protective custody? Later Mark tells about his family history to Reggie, and what happened. Mark's trailer is burned down by the mob! His mother is quite upset. Mark is taken into protective custody. Judge Roosevelt holds a court hearing, when Mark testifies he invoked the Fifth Amendment! He will stay in protective custody. Can he escape? A man chases him [for action or suspense]. Mark calls Reggie for help. Does he have a dangerous plan to find a body? They find that boathouse. Will the bad guys also go there? The body is under a thin layer of concrete. There is a surprise: an alarm goes off, the bad guys run away. Reggie makes a deal with Roy to safeguard Mark's family in the Witness Protection program. This is done quickly. Barry ""the blade"" goes on a ride with two pals. Mark's family goes to a new location and will live in a real home ""with walk-in closets"". Reggie says goodby to Roy. There seems to be a happy ending for the good guys.

There seems to be too much comedy for a crime drama. Mark seems to be way too smart for his age (maybe twelve?). This movie seems to mock the Federal prosecutor and his staff, and others. Some humor is often used in dramas to relieve the tension. Was it done correctly here? All in all, it is an interesting story but incredible in parts. Was the book better? The suicide of that lawyer seems like a gimmick to create a story. Making a murder victim disappear goes back to Judge Crater (or Jimmy Hoffa). Putting a body in a shallow grave near housing doesn't seem realistic. Overall, this movie would have been better if it was more serious.",1328659200,3,2668,4.364185110663984

614552,4,6303269834,"Oh, hey, remember when Hollywood was all gaga about John Grisham? When people made much ado about THE FIRM? Nowadays Grisham isn't as much the cinematic darling, although he still gets his stuff adapted to film here and there. Today, he doesn't register so strongly on the public's awareness meter. Which is sad, because I still pick up his legal thrillers. I should maybe harp on that adage about familiarity breeding contempt. But no.

The topic for discussion, THE CLIENT, isn't as engrossing or entertaining a film as THE FIRM or THE RAINMAKER or RUNAWAY JURY. But it's better than THE CHAMBER or A TIME TO KILL. THE CLIENT's powerhouse cast, more than anything else, makes this worth a peek. The thin premise relies on your cooperation, on your buying that a trailer home kid in Memphis, Tennessee would scorn the protection of the police and keep mum about what he witnessed. And I get it; there are folks out there who want no truck with the authorities. So the premise is thin but, I guess, plausible.

Savvy eleven-year-old Mark Sway (a likable Brad Renfro) comes from one of them down and out families, what social workers label as ""indigent."" Like his hard-working young mother, Mark has never gotten a break in life, this maybe accounting for his street smarts and his fierce independence and how he's so slow to trust. In Memphis, Tennessee, one day, Mark and his younger brother are out playing in the nearby woods when they witness the suicide shooting of a mob lawyer. Except that before the lawyer offed himself, he confessed to Mark certain unsavory facts. And maybe if that cop hadn't been so suspicious and condescending, Mark would've come across.

Much of Mark's awareness of how the world works is based on what he's seen on television. He figures he's stepped deep in it and decides to go fetch himself legal representation. A flier discarded by an ambulance chaser leads him to a law firm, and in that building he stumbles across Reggie Love (Susan Sarandon), inexperienced woman attorney and recovering alcoholic. Except that Reggie doesn't talk down to Mark, and sometimes all a body needs is to not be talked down to. Also she takes on the case for only a dollar.

Reggie's got her work cut out for her as everyone - the press, the mob, the FBI, and especially the spotlight-hogging, Scriptures-quoting federal prosecutor ""Reverend"" Roy Foltrigg (Tommy Lee Jones) - is trying to make her young client talk. Her two years of practicing law put her at a disadvantage. Reggie goes out on a limb anyway, puts her career at risk. Susan Sarandon, who would be nominated for an Oscar for this role, invests her character with plenty of fight. Reggie Love is marvelously scrappy. She even tries her hand at being nurturing.

THE CLIENT is a taut legal thriller in its own right, although there are only a very few scenes that take place in the courtroom. But it's more of a crime drama, what with the mob presence and the chase scenes. The film's strength is in its cast. Really, only the rash, dumb hood played by Anthony La Paglia comes off as weak and obvious. Will Patton is very effective as the menacing cop who sets Mark on his path of nondisclosure. Ossie Davis is a regal and sympathetic judge who must rule on whether he should order Mark to 'fess up in court. Mary Louise Parker does more than expected with her thankless role of Mark's plaintive and impoverished single mother. Anthony Edwards, a very good actor, is shamefully relegated to playing background prop. But on the credits, he's Reggie's law partner.

Susan Sarandon and Tommy Lee Jones are commanding and impeccable, and I relished those moments in which they bared their teeth at each other, Sarandon's defiant, heavy-lidded gaze against Jones' dead-eye stare. Don't be surprised if you draw parallels between Jones' performance here and his U.S. Marshall from THE FUGITIVE. Sarandon and Renfro also make the most of their characters' strong emotional bond, Reggie Love having rapidly become Mark's one trusted friend, champion, and surrogate mom. Reggie gets so invested in her client that some of the measures she takes to protect Mark constitute straight-up grounds for disbarment. THE CLIENT, polished and expertly crafted, isn't as ambitious or artistic as THE FIRM, what with director Joel Schumacher content to be a crowd-pleasing technician rather than aspire to the aesthetic heights achieved by Sydney Pollack. And because THE CLIENT doesn't dare to be great, and because Schumacher opts for the common denominator thrills, what we get is a solid and enjoyable enough film. But there's a reason I rank it below three other Grisham adaptations. 3.5 out of 5 stars for THE CLIENT.

The DVD's paltry bonus stuff: ""A Nationwide Search"" - text article recalling the nationwide search for a child actor to play ""Mark Sway""; ""Behind the Scenes"" notes on THE CLIENT; the theatrical trailer; and cast & crew credits.",1316390400,,4913,4.862604540023895
614553,5,6303269834,"Really good movie. Taut script with crisp direction. Susan Sarandon was excellent as Reggie Love, and Mark Renfro was absolutely believable as Mark Sway. Tommy Lee Jones was a regular hard-case who turns out alright in the end, and Mary Louise-Parker was terrific as Dianne Sway. I wanted to see this movie ever since it came out in 1994, but i was only 8 years old then. Whoever wrote the script did a fine job. Had I written the screenplay, though, I would have added several more scenes, just to flesh out Mark and Reggie a little more and provide closure to the murder case. The only part I didn't really like was when Reggie says that Foltrigg knows the Bible better than God Himself, which I feel is blasphemy. Other than that, terrific movie.",1310515200,,749,4.555555555555555
614554,3,6303269834,"Generally, I enjoy the movies made from Grisham's novels--suspenseful thrillers. This one, ehh, just OK. The mystery element wasn't that strong, for one thing--where's the body buried--whoop tee do. And the kid, well....he's one AWFULLY SMART kid with a highly clever, quick-thinking wit for the son of a trailer-trash mom. Just a little incredible how one minute he's just a kid who's in big trouble, and the next minute, he's the hero of the day, making everybody else look stupid--lol. Entertaining, I guess but... And how exactly did he fake his illness that got him sent to the hospital? I guess I missed that.

I never read the book, so I can't say whether or not this was just a bad adaptation of Grisham's novel to the big screen, but I just wasn't too impressed by it. The characters are well portrayed and acted--no complaints there--just not a lot of action or mystery to offset the farfetched parts of it.",1289606400,,917,4.73125
614555,4,6303269834,"A nice little thriller. The heroes are two kids who, by accident, some summer afternoon, witness a suicide, well witness: in fact a little bit more. The two kids are living with their mother in a trailer, a mobile home. There is no father. They are indigent people. One kid gets into some kind of a coma caused by the post-traumatic syndrome of the event and the other hates cops, super-hates the FBI, does not trust lawyers and yet he picks one more or less by accident. The suicide is connected to some important murder by some kind of mafia and the whole gist of the case is to find the body of this dead person. Then of course the kid does not want to speak being afraid for his family. The lawyer has to support him but she cannot do anything illegal. The child is an enterprising young man of maybe 12 and he is as difficult to keep in one place as the north wind itself, except that he is coming from and going to all the cardinal points at the same time. The rest is detail and you will love to discover these gritty details. Keep in mind the central element in this film is a compass. And enjoy the chase.

It was fun watching all the smart people trying to outsmart each other.  Susan Sarandon was her usual sexy, smart, stubborn and soulful self.  Tommy Lee Jones gave her a good run for her money...they are an excellent match. It would have been interesting to see some more sparks fly between those two, but that would have been a different story. Jones brings his enormous charm and intelligence to what could have been a one-dimensional character.  The boy, Brad Renfro did an amazing job for a non-actor.  The rest of the supporting cast was good too.

The relationship between Sarandon as the lawyer and Renfro, as the boy, is very well written and wonderfully played.  Sarandon walks the line between tender and tough beautifully and she deserved the Oscar nomination for a memorable performance.

I wouldn't call it realistic; rather as Raymond Chandler said of his ""gritty"" stories of  Bay City, California, and environs, they are romances, not sociology.  From its earliest moments, one knows that this kid is in trouble, the question is what happens to him once the law and the killers know he has information helpful to the first, damning to the second.  Tommy Lee Jones, as the ambitious U.S. Attorney is directed to give an over the top performance but the last, more human scenes, save the film from falling into the pit of farce. Susan Sarandon does a fine job  as the kid's attorney and Renfro, as the kid with dangerous knowledge, does a fine job of being a pain in the neck without losing the special qualities of an eleven year old.

On the topic of mothers, Mark's mother was fairly mis-cast.  She was too pretty and didn't really fit the bill of chain smoking trailer trash that Grisham's novel portrayed her as - one of the many things that broke the spell of beleivability for me.  I really felt all the star power got in the way of this story and let me just say that I liked the book a lot - the movie left me more or less unmoved.  There were so many familiar faces in the movie, all calling to mind other movies I'd seen them in, I had a hard time believing in this one.  The doctor at the first hospital is the guy in Fargo.  Reggie's assistant (whose name I don't know) I've seen in a bunch of other movies.  Most of the FBI group is pretty recognizable.  Tommy Lee Jones was good as the arrogant politician.

Nobody ever thought Sarandon was in danger when she finally told the FBI where the body was, so why all the bother with the Witness Protection Program?  Yes, the plot was silly, but the kid was good, and Jones and Sarandon are always easy to watch.  And the actress who played the mother was very good.

From his southern accent to his bullheaded obstination, Renfro creates a portrait of a child looking for love and leadership.  He and his little brother witness the suicide of a gangland lawyer, who before dying tells Renfro where the body of a murdered senator is hidden.  Tommy Lee Jones as a slick Federal attorney decides that Renfro knows the location and wants the boy to talk.  Bright Renfro decides he needs a lawyer and ends up with Susan Sarandon, in her fourth Oscar nominated performance.  Of course, since the little boy has become a media darling, the bad guys want him too.  The expected chase begins, but not before some touching and exciting sequences occur.
Director Joel Schumacher keeps things moving nicely and elicits strong performances from a rather starstudded cast: Mary Louise Parker as Renfro's mom; Ossie Davis as a no nonsense judge; Micole Mercurio as Sarandon's nice mama; Anthony LaPaglia as the slimy murderer; Anthony Edwards as Sarandon's assistant, and Bradley Whitford as the yuppie lawyer.  Ultimately though, it's the power of Renfro and Sarandon's performances that catapult this movie into its stratosphere.

Well, the director thinks it's enough that he smirks and snickers and bites his lips. He is repellent. Saradon is
always an intelligent actress though I suspect she is mainly
a nice person so her roles are roles for nice people. If
this turns you on, then there is at least one things in the movie that might please you. As for the photography
(pedestrian) and the music (out of place, sugar + epic
feeling = big meaningful spponfuls of sugar sounds), well,
you only have two hands, so chose your poison--watch or
listen? Did I mention the plot: Basically good but poor and 'tough' (read cute) kid is chased by bad guys and
selfishly used by corrupt (but cute) polititian. Kid is protected by woman lawyer (cute but weary) who identifies
with kid and wants to help despite kid's misguided rejection of her. Every issue that needs to be touched on (abusive father, alcoholic recovery, nosy press) is touched on, loudly and clearly. And, for those who  care about such things,  everything turns out well: the ending is predictable and

614895,4,6303269834,"I had to read and watch the Client at the same time at school. John Grisham is a great author I know. So I thought that this story would be very thrilling. And it was!  Well, the book is from ""Penguin  Readers"". This is a short form of the original - too short for me. But  the DVD is really good.  The actors are famous. Tommy Lee Jones and Susan  Sharandon are great and I think they played their roles very well. The only  point I didn`t like too much is, like in a lot of other films, the end.  It`s too simple. But on the whole it is a great thriller.",949363200,2,556,3.9107142857142856
614896,4,6303269834,"I think the Client is one of the best stories by John Grisham. The film is very thrilling and interesting, but I find it a pity, that many good scenes are missing on DVD.

614897,4,6303269834,"I think it`s a thrilling story. First we had to read the book and after that, we saw the DVD. Some scenes are a bit boring. That`s why I gave the DVD only 4 stars! I like to see Tommy Lee Jones as a lawyer. It`s a perfect  role for him. And all the other actors did their job really well,too.",949363200,,292,3.7868852459016393

I had not read the book until I had seen the movie a few times, and I think the movie was about as close as you can  get.  I hate Tommy Lee (Not Pamela's Hubbie), but he was bearable in this  movie.  This puts ""The Firm"" to shame.  I thik this is a must  see, and a must own.",940464000,,384,3.5421686746987953

Anthony LaPaglia(from Without a Trace) is exceptional as sleazy killer and Tommy Lee Jones puts on a great performance.

Typical pre-teen from indigent, fatherless, family.  Susan Sarandon was awesome.  I love women with balls.  Tommy Lee is Tommy Lee, a great actor. I'm sure that both attorneys; Susan, the defense attorney and Tommy Lee, prosecutor wanted to kill this kid at times.  Whoever wrote the script was awesome.",1524873600,,456,4.658227848101266

7842206,2,6303269834,"It is fairly entertaining but it's one more movie that spreads the false stereotype of Southerners being crass and stupid.  There is an apparent exception in the Susan Sarandon character where she is the hero, but she is also a former alcoholic who lost custody of her children and has no man in her life so she is a largely a negative character as well.  I question why the casting directors of these stereotyping movies set in the South cast non-Southerners in the main parts so the actors put on exaggerated accents and mannerisms that negatively associate a Southern accent with buffoonery and cupidity.  They also like to have pictures of Jesus, crosses and other Christian symbols and pictures in the background while the unattractive Southern and at times hypocritically ""Christian"" character is throwing out sanctimonious Bible quotes to negatively associate the genuine piety of Christians with falseness and deception.  This basically uses the thin entertainment factor as a vehicle for anti-Southern, anti-Christian propaganda.",1523318400,,1038,5.310975609756097
