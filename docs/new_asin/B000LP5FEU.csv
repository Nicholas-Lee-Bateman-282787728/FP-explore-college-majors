The acting is a little stiff and at times worse however Alain Rangel who played Miguel did have some great facial expressions. He may have been the best actor in the movie. The English subtitles have problems, and I can tell this without understanding the original language. Still I had no trouble understanding the dialogue.
The story is set around a school where six children have recently been murdered and dismembered. Two boys who are each dealing with the death of loved ones (prior to, and unrelated to the current murders) become friends, or at least try to become friends.
This movie is not really a murder mystery, a third of the way through the movie the audience knows for sure who is committing the murders, and should have figured it out way before that. The movie instead is a drama about the boys, their motives, their feelings, their reactions and how they relate to each other and with others around them.
The movie does a fair job of creating an atmosphere of suspense in the last thirty minutes as the plot reaches its conclusion.
I liked the movie, but it had the potential to be much better if it had had better production.",1406764800,,1313,4.567796610169491

8162805,2,B000LP5FEU,"This looked like a very interesting story, and it is.  If they had a few million bucks they could have made a great film out of this story.  So, while the story is there, the production values are, um, lacking to say the least.  I appreciate independant film makers, and I give Leopoldo Laborde credit for getting this one out there.  I'm sure his later films are just fine.  This film was made with no lighting (which is why everything happens during the day), no microphones save the one ""on the camera"", and I have a feeling he used his own house for the set.  The subtitles get a little humorous with typos.  Overall the low-budget nature becomes just distracting, taking the viewers mind off of the story, which is fairly well played.",1213920000,12,739,4.511278195488722
