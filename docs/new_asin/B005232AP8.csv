4526754,4,B005232AP8,"A troubled and rebellious teen (Lon McCallister) is sent to live with his aunt (Charlotte Greenwood) and uncle (Walter Brennan) on a rundown former horse breeding farm. His love for horses helps him bond with his uncle and they attempt to turn a foal into a champion harness racer. This Technicolor homespun tale is part animal movie (think NATIONAL VELVET) and part young romance as sophisticated June Haver and tomboyish Jeanne Crain both attract McCallister's attention. It's the horse movie that features the more compelling storyline. The young players are attractive with enough spark (it's easy to see why Crain quickly became a popular fan favorite) to hold their own with the horses. It may be corn but there's enough impartial emotion that you don't have to feel manipulated when you get teary eyed at the film's end. The color cinematography by Edward Conjager (1943's HEAVEN CAN WAIT) was nominated for an Oscar. Directed by the veteran Henry Hathaway, musical score by Hugo Friedhofer. With Ward Bond, Willie Best, Charles Dingle, Robert Condon and George Reed. Remade in 1957 as APRIL LOVE.

The Fox DVD from Spain is a slightly faded Technicolor print but other than that, it's a clear transfer in its accurate 1.33 aspect ratio.",1315353600,8,1244,5.009661835748792
4526755,5,B005232AP8,"I was just a kid in Boy Scout camp back in the mid forties when I first saw ""Home in Indiana"" with Lon McCallister and Jeanne Crain. Seeing this old movie today brought be back across the years to that moment. What a great experience. The print is old and somewhat faded, but the nostalgia and innocence of a bye-gone age are  still there. What a rare treat. Times have certainly changed, but for anyone who remembers the ""good old days,"" this movie is a must. Highly recommended.",1311206400,13,480,4.454545454545454

4526767,4,B005232AP8,"I collect copies of classic films. (Best Academy Award movies, Silents  etc).
The AFI will never add this film to it's list of favorites, but all who view Home in Indiana will be hooked.  II have been a fan of this picture since the local channel, Sunday afternoon viewings in the 1970's. I've sat down and watched this film many times and never get tired of it. I own a DVD and VHS copy.
In 1944, this was considered just another wartime feature turned out by 20th Century Fox. with an upcoming young cast.
Many of the leading men were off fighting the war. This was a chance for talented, young stars to be seen in a feature film. Lon McCallister was already an extra with cameos at other major studios.  Jeanne Crain went on to become a leading actress opposite some of Hollywood's handsome male stars. June Haver (Mrs. Fred MacMurray) reteamed with Lon and Walter Brennan in Scudda Hoy, Scudda Hay. (early cameo with Marilyn Monroe.) and became a stock Fox player along with Betty Grable, John Payne etc.

Indiana is a feelgood film. You won't be disappointed. This was life in a quite time and place, an escape from the tragedy of WW II.  The casting fit all the characters so well. I also enjoy  the soundtrack music ,composed by Emil Newman, Randy Newman's Uncle. I like to watch the film and remember when my Dad and I spent time talking and watching classic films together.  I'm waiting for a beautiful DVD or Blu Ray print that would pay homage to Natalie Kalmus Technicolor process. Fox has been tardy with releasing some of their early classics. The film is highly recommended by me, (three to three and half stars) so, invest in a cheap copy for now and campaign for a better release in the future.

4526768,5,B005232AP8,"I just bought Home In Indiana and was so happy to see it in DVD.  I was ll years old when I was in Kentucky with my parents to see the horse races  that my Dad loved to go to.  Just my good luck I was there to see the making of this movie. Byron Perry, one of the race drivers who was a friend of my Dads said he would take me around and introduce me to all the stars.  Boy, was I thrilled!  I met and got autographs of stars like- Jeanne Crain June Haver, Ward Bond and Lon McCallister.  I still have the autographs in a small notebook.  Also met Walter Brennan but didn't get his autograph as he was due on the set for the next scene.  I also got the autograph of the director, Henry Hathaway.  I must say all the stars were so nice and I will never forget that wonderful day in Lexington, Ky.  How lucky I was to meet them and they took the time to write their names in my little notebook.  This is a good family movie and I would suggest you have it in your library of movies.  Peggy Eggleston",1411257600,3,997,3.9054726368159205
4526769,5,B005232AP8,I really enjoyed this.  Was it academy award material.no.but it was a good sentimental Sunday afternoon movie!,1405209600,,110,5.470588235294118
4526770,1,B005232AP8,"How is it possible for a major studio like 20th Century Fox to be so cavalier about its vintage product? Doesn't the person responsible for deciding what appears on DVD realize that one of the glories of the studio was its stunning use of Technicolor? To release films such as Wabash Avenue and now Home in Indiana in murky washed-out prints insults not only this great studio's integrity but shows a shameful indifference to the potential customer who is asked to fork out $20 or so for a bad print. I guess the DVD release of The Best Things In Life Are Free in a panned-and-scanned (!!) print says it all. They just don't know what they're doing. What a pity those in charge don't have the same sense of the studio's history as, say, the people responsible for the Warner Archive.

4526771,1,B005232AP8,"I was interested to read mr morris' review as I do not buy any Fox Archive discs now unless I have read an account of the quality from a purchaser.  It is so sad for film enthusiasts, who have waited for years for these rare movies to appear on DVD, that a once admired company is treating its customers so disgustingly.  Warners have shown what can be done, and I have purchased over 200 discs from them in the past few years.  I have bought just five from Fox, and feel guilty at supporting them at all.  Home in Indiana, though, joins the dozens of discs I will not purchase because of poor quallity such as Appartment for Peggy, Wabash Avenue, the panned and scanned (how could they?) Best Things in Life are Free etc.
I've been watching out for Margie to appear, but probably won't buy it when it does.  What will they have done to the beautiful colour that helps make the film such a classic?  tonval",1391731200,12,906,4.331360946745562
4526772,1,B005232AP8,"When I read that Fox Cinema Archives was going to be releasing ""Home in Indiana"" on DVD, I was really excited. I saw this movie on the FX channel a few years back and enjoyed it. It's a forgotten little gem, featuring Jeanne Crain, Lon McCallister, and June Haver in early career performances. (For more on the movie, including a plot summary, feel free to visit IMDb.)

Unfortunately, the Fox Archive program has gotten a reputation for being hit or miss with the quality of their releases, and this particular release is sadly one of their misses. The print quality isn't terrible by any means, but it IS pretty soft, with a fair amount of blemishing / dirt / debris throughout. It would have been great to have a crisp, clean print of this. Instead, it feels like the Fox Archive crew simply pulled the existing VHS version of this movie off the shelf and duped it onto DVD, for a quick buck. [UPDATE: I have a friend who owns an official studio-released VHS version of ""Home in Indiana"" and when we compared the VHS version and the DVD version, it looks like Fox did indeed just dupe the new DVD release from the old VHS version.]

If Fox is going to charge almost $20 for this (and their other Archive releases), they really should have the courtesy to at least strike a brand new print of the movie(s) first. I'm not even talking about doing any restoration work, which I know would probably be prohibitively expensive, especially with small movies like this one, that aren't likely to sell a ton of copies. However, having been spoiled by the pretty consistently great quality of DVD releases under the Warner Archive program, I've come to expect other studios to deliver the same kind of quality, but maybe that's too much to ask.

Bottom line, I hate to turn anyone away from this sweet little film, but at the same time, I really hate to reward Fox for putting out second-rate product. They can -- and have -- done better with (some of their) previous releases under the Fox Cinema Archive banner. Very disappointing...",1391212800,33,2029,4.599447513812155
4526773,2,B005232AP8,"My rating isn't based on the movie itself but the quality of the dvd. I was under the impression the dvd was new, however on receiving it the dvd looked like a home made job. About three quarters of the way through it started to pixilate and then freeze. I will contact the seller and see what they will do.",1386115200,5,307,4.133333333333334
4526774,5,B005232AP8,I already have this movie on VHS tape but decided to also have the DVD. I have already enjoyed the movie twice. It is the earlier version that also was done as APRIL LOVE. (I have not been able to add the DVD of that version to its VHS copy.) Thank you for offering these grand old films.,1362873600,3,288,3.9827586206896552
4526775,5,B005232AP8,"This is not a great film, and I am not interested in horses or racing, but from 1945 when I was a movie-struck 15 year old and went to Adelaide's magnificent Regent Theatre to enjoy the ambience and the Wurlitzer organ music, not caring about what was on the programme, I have loved this movie. Now in my eighties, I have a signed photograph of Lon McCallister in my cinema room and an original day-bill..

The charm of 'Home in Indiana' lay in the fine cast of young actors - Lon,  Jeanne Crain and June Haver, ably supported by experienced and loveable adults, and the relations between them, plus the magnificent Technicolor photography. It made Indiana seem like a paradise on Earth to an impressionable young Australian, so much so that on one of my adult visits to the USA I made a special effort to visit that state. I was far from the only person who fell under its spell. It was, I think, the top box-office movie of the year.

I cannot understand why Twentieth Century-Fox has never released the film on DVD, particularly as they remade the story as 'April Love'. The two would make a very good double disk album. There is a dearth of films without violence and with 'feel-good' values in these days of mindless action and special effects, and a reminder of the time when film makers mainly depicted the world in a positive light would indeed be refreshing.",1320451200,24,1367,4.548780487804878
8453475,5,B005232AP8,I think this is a fun movie for people who like horses--especially harness racing.  I saw it when I was much younger in the late 1940s and enjoyed it then.
