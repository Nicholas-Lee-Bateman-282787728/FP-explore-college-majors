6561680,3,B00M574A3O,"This set was poorly described. The cover is very misleading. The pictures shown are not the representation of the actors. Kiefer and Keenu are only in one movie, together. Which is when they were really young. Titled ""Brotherhood of justice"" Plot is weak, and all other movies though some are better then others are three star films. I tried to place a longer review earlier which showed all movies and plots, and my opinion but was unaccepted, I suppose it was too long. Either way, I was disappointed in this purchase. Mainly, because I thought it would be a better Kiefer movie to watch, he barely had 7 scenes in ""Brotherhood."". Some movies though are good, just I felt like if I had known this knowledge beforehand, I would have skipped this set. So I felt a little robbed. But if you can get it cheap, then by all mends, take a gamble, you might actually like some of them.",1432166400,13,879,4.5
6561681,3,B00M574A3O,"First of all, Kiefer Sutherland is not in every story.  The several stories I've seen are not all bad; I was just disappointed in what I thought would be a continuation of ""24"".",1425945600,3,177,4.363636363636363

6561683,5,B00M574A3O,"Either this past Friday night (January 16) or Saturday night (January  17) was when I purchased this 17 movie set on four dvds from my Walmart job for just five dollars. My husband thinks it might have more likely been this past Friday night (January 16th). The front of the dvd cover includes a photo of Kiefer Sutherland and the back of the dvd photo includes Keanu Reeves and Dolph Lundgren. I admit that I did not have time to watch all the movies yet. However, I intend to update this review by March 2015 on a longer review for all 17 of the movies. So far, I have only watched CIA II; Target Alexa (starring Lorenzo Llamas, Kathleen Kinmont, and Jon Savage). In CIA II the character of Mark Graver  (Lorenzo Lamas) teams up with Alexa (Kathleen Kinmount) to take care of some unfinished business involving Franz Kluge (John Salvage).  Kluge is a very dangerous man, especially because his female partner in crime is just as violent, if not more so than he is. What complicates matters is the fact that Alexa and Kluge are strongly linked because Alexa became pregnant by Kluge and had a daughter named Tanya. However, the catch to the dvd set is that none of the three men on the dvd cover (Kiefer Sutherland, Keanu Reeves, and Dolph  Lundgren) are not necessarily in every movie featured such as CIA II. The following are the other 16 movies listed for those who understandably would like to decide before March on whether or not to get this 17 movie dvd set; 1-Brotherhood of Justice, Black Jack, Choke, The Contract, Crosshairs, Alone In The Neon Jungle, South Bronx Heroes, Zero Tolerance, Tunnel Vision, Spenser; Pale Kings & Princes, Nightmare At Bittercreek, The Fall, Crash Landing, Burning Daylight, Running Red, and Second Story Man.",1421971200,21,1750,4.709150326797386
6561684,2,B00M574A3O,"The ad was misleading.  I had searched for Kiefer Sutherland and when this came up I thought he was in lots of the movies.  It turned out he was only in two, or possibly three tops.",1421539200,29,181,4.0

8670369,1,B00M574A3O,"Extremely misleading. OK, I knew that not all 17 movies would have Kiefer Sutherland in them. However I was very disappointed to find that only one movie has Kiefer in it and its a movie he was in before he made The Lost Boys. Even the picture on the front of the DVD is misleading as it's a picture from a movie that isn't even included. If you flip the DVD case over there's another picture of Keanu Reeves and it also says 17 movies featuring Keanu Reeves and Dolph Lundgren. Most of the movies don't have any of these actors in them. I would return it, but it cost less to keep it, then to send it back. Not buying from Delightful Home Entertainment again.",1481068800,40,660,4.246031746031746
