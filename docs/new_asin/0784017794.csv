7795643,5,0784017794,"This is the only workout video that I ever use regularly.  4 ten-minute workouts are the perfect length/intensity/variety!  Denise is very positive, which is one of my favorite aspects of the video.  I only wish it was converted to DVD!!!",1317600000,,238,4.9
7795644,5,0784017794,I use to do this ab tape in high school and had excellent results on my stomach.  10 years and 2 kids later I hadn't done any ab exercises and looked online for workout videos.  Any ab workouts I've done do not compare to this tape.  I still remembered it from high school so went online and ordered it.  I have had great results with it yet again and am very happy I ordered it.  Denise has 3 different segments in this video and each is 10 minutes.  However I really enjoy the first two (Classic Abs and Non-Stop Abs)  I do both of them everyday.  If you're not familiar with Denise Austin she encourages you throughout the workout and talks to you as she's preforming the exercise.  She tells you you're doing great and that you're going to look great. She's not too forceful and constant with it in case some people are annoyed by that.,1314835200,,840,4.2993630573248405
7795645,3,0784017794,I ususally love denise austin with her goofy attitude and her energy.  I also like the fact that im clumsy and have no dance skills she makes her choreography easy to follow.  However i was a little dissapointed in this video.  I didn't get a good ab work out.  i thought it was ineffective and way too easy.  the second and third session is somewhat challenging but ill stick with the firm 5 day abs.,1012435200,,401,4.293333333333333
