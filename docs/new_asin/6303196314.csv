602693,4,6303196314,"I'm guessing that a lot of the people who have seen Lily C.A.T. are more anime people without a horror background.  I have owned this movie on VHS for close to 15 years now, and I'm begging to see it released on DVD!  This movie IS (if nothing else) a classic!

There are few anime titles that approach the horror genre in this manner.  It is far more like an American horror from the 80's than a Japanese horror from any time frame.

If you grew up watching the 1980's space/underwater horror titles.  Buy this now.  You will get to see one of the rare instances where an anime pays homage to those great movies.

If you have seen ""Leviathan"" then you will recognize this horror.  Though it happens in space, it is a very similar situation - but remember this is an anime that predates Akira - It is a classic.

Enjoy classic anime/horror fans!",1221091200,4,845,4.358974358974359
602694,3,6303196314,"While blatantly reminiscient of Aliens, this flick still holds a soft spot in my heart as it was the first anime feature movie I had seen (remember this is circa 1987)... of course, not withstanding episode anime such as Speed Racer and Astro Boy.
If you like sci-fi/horror/thrillers like Aliens, you will like this. Quality of renderings were very stylized/advanced when reminded of its release date (two years before the classic AKIRA).  The violence, while graphic, was not too gratuitous.  Americanesque characters, yet Japanese quality renderings (it is Japanese produced and directed) and its unlikely subject genre for an anime make it an interesting watch.
Do to its age and story line, it really cannot be compared to other anime feature films, but I do consider it a classic if only for its age and attempt to mirror live action hollywood flicks.
Worth renting or buying on the cheap for those who wish to build serious collections.",1017187200,6,942,4.993630573248407

7841447,5,6303196314,"I've read a few reviews for this movie and although I have to agree with some that say this movie seemed to be copying what was already done - I try to look at it as a film that is paying homage to prior films that might've inspired, rather than copying. Either way, I enjoyed it and am very glad it is apart of my collection.",1433894400,5,326,3.9545454545454546
7841448,3,6303196314,"This is a anime that follows the role of the first ALIEN film and John Carpenters THE THING , same backgrounds and elements. Only the alien life form is a strain of bacteria that feeds on flesh and dissolves its victims. This anime is more of an Americanized animation other than most anime films. Good film, only they would show more of the monsters.",1423440000,,351,4.5
7841449,3,6303196314,"Lily C.A.T is pure 80's anime, and sports some great production values.  The animation is fluid and top notch, the character designs are strong and distinctive (although one character does kind of look like Abe Lincoln), and it has some very interesting ideas.  The problem is, the film doesn't capitalize on those ideas.

The basic plot is that there are a bunch of people trapped on a space ship, two people are not who they say they are, something has taken over control of the ship, and an alien bacteria is quickly bumping off the cast.

While there are a few twists and turns, the majority of the film is just one giant chase scene, followed by a lot of characters making dumb decisions, which usually leads to their (off screen) deaths.  Lily C.A.T actually shows a great deal of promise.  The story, while derivative of several major Hollywood movies (Alien and The Thing being the most obvious), is fairly interesting, and holds some initial promise.  The problem is that the movie's short run time, and lightening speed pacing strip the story of any actual development. Still, there is a surprising amount of atmosphere.  There are some very creepy, tense moments, especially early on, when the camera follows the cat around the ship.  The use of lighting, music and sound work perfectly to create a sense of dread and fear, something that I have found very hard to create in animation.

Lily C.A.T sports a very large cast, but you will really only get to know four characters in any detail, although little moments are scattered through out the film to try and build up the rest of the cast, they aren't always effective enough to make the audience care.  Outside of the main four characters, the majority of the cast is dispatched VERY quickly with some deaths seemingly coming out of nowhere.  While there are a few shockingly gory moments, the majority of the action takes place off screen, with only a few, brief flashes of the creature and any kind of real gore.  The creature, when you see it, is wonderfully designed, and very grotesque, although most of the film you only catch glimpses of it.

The one thing that truly saves Lily C.A.T is the nostalgia factor.  From the art to the music, the whole film screams the 1980's.  The animation is surprisingly solid, and the ship designs are down right stunning.  The characters, while not the most attractive, are like a little time capsule of bad fashion choices, and Saturday morning cartoons gone wrong (some of the characters look like they just stepped out of Jem).  The designs are distinctive, and the art reflects the racially diverse nature of the cast very well.  The one exception is the lone black character who looks like a bad caricature.  Still, the film is perfect for a glimpse of anime before it was all big eyes, bouncing boobs and cute girls.

The disc itself is pretty good.  I listened to the English language track, which is a port of the old Streamline dub.  The audio was strong, although at times it sounded oddly digitized and crackly.  It didn't strike me so much as an error with the disc, but instead as a failed attempt to give some of the voices a slight echo, to make it sound like they were bouncing off the steel walls of the ship.  The dub itself is very strong, with some great performances.  Considering the majority of the cast is American, the English language version feels more natural.

The video is fine, although it reflects the source material's age.  The image is clear, while still retaining the grain from a production that was shot on film.  I doubt there will ever be a better looking release of this film, and all things considered, visually it holds up quite well.

Lily C.A.T is not an easy recommendation.  The film is short, clocking in at just over an hour, and while the premise is interesting, the execution leaves something to be desired.  Still, those looking for an old school flashback might find something to enjoy, and the film is a wonderful example of hand drawn animation done well.  This one is for fans of old school anime, and sci-fi/horror die hards only.",1396915200,9,4094,4.673184357541899
7841450,5,6303196314,"I rented this one time at a Video Store I used to go to when it was still open. There it was on the one shelf with the
small Anime section they had, Lilly Cat on VHS and English Dubbed only. I saw it and really loved it. It was another great ANIME from Japan I wanted to add to my collection. I tried to find it on dvd on Amazon whom I love buying from but it was not found. I even tried finding a DVD-R copy from another website but none to be found. But now I finally have it on dvd thanks to DISCOTECK. keep up the great work you guys and release some other great stuff too. when you buy it, it is just the movie only. there are no extra features. A behind the scenes thing would have been great but no. there is just the scenes and the languages for you to select. For languages you select either the old VHS English Dub or finally the Japanese Language with optional english subtitles. that of course is how I want to watch it. Also there is a extra button on the menu that says JAPANESE CREDITS. when you select this you can watch the opening and ending with the credits in japanese if that counts as a little extra feature.
anyway very happy with my purchase from AMAZON like always!!!!!",1393632000,6,1194,4.085106382978723
7841451,5,6303196314,"I remember this as one of the first anime purchases I ever made, at a comics convention back in the late 80's.  Raw Japanese, no subtitles, but the influences of Alien and Aliens (and other US movies that were based off/ripped off those two) were also present (as well as shades of John Carpenter's The Thing).

Surprisingly violent and gory in a couple of spots, and with its own spring-loaded cat a la Alien, this will always be a classic to me simply because it was one of the first anime I bought that wasn't brought over for American TV (Star Blazers/Yamato, Battle of the Planets/Science Ninja Team Gatchaman).

I think if you enjoyed Alien or Aliens (or the John Carpenter Thing), you should enjoy this film, complete with alien menace, people being done away with in dark, twisting corridors, and an animation style that really WAS the 1980's.  You can also see how American cinema of the day heavily influenced not just the stories being told, but the LOOK of them, too.

If you prefer the newer anime, this might be a bit tame or staid for you, but if you grew up with 1970's and 1980's anime and pop culture, this is a great item to add to the anime library.

NOT for kids.  I know some people equate anime to cartoons and therefore kiddie-fare.  This is not for little kids unless they are already watching slasher and gorefest movies.

Enjoy!",1393372800,4,1355,4.54320987654321
7841452,5,6303196314,"You'd probably used to find this flick airing on the old sci fi channel in it's better days,and yeah one might think this a copy of alien and leviathan,but it mixes the two together and makes one of the best anime classics around. The amano artwork is well detailed,and the characters,even though almost all of them died,were all very interesting.

The alien creature itself is also quite hideous it would make the h.r.giger created aliens look like cuddly pikachus in comparison,yikes!

A definite must have for fans of sci fi anime.",1330041600,2,534,4.857142857142857
