6290466,5,B00IS6WPT2,"An excellent ten part series of the origins, politics and battles of the First World War.  I have seen these episodes several times on the Military Channel and wanted to add it to my collection. Considered the first industrial war WWI also created new nations and new animosities.  It is a relevant documentary as witnessed by the conflicts in the Middle East and the continued attempts by the Atlantists to dominate Africa.

The quality of transfer is fine and the amount of archived films is vast.  There is plenty of educational value to :""The First World War"" and a strong moral lesson to be learned.  Unfortunately this lesson fell on deaf ears.  One hundred years after the start of WWI every nation that was involved is still trying to fix the mistakes only to create a bigger mess.  IMHO we are still fighting World War One with no end in site.",1405468800,44,852,4.602649006622516
6290467,5,B00IS6WPT2,"I have been studying WWI in a number of formats over the past three years.  This series put it all together for me.  It did a tremendous and thorough job of explaining the insanity and why certain things were done and not done.  It certainly opened my eyes to some of the stupidity about which I was clueless... like Britain turning the Pacific over to the Japanese against China, eventually leading to Pearl Harbor.  And that is but one example of many that you'll find in this extremely well done series.",1404864000,4,506,4.527472527472527

6290470,4,B00IS6WPT2,"My copy arrived the other day.  Amazon glossed over the technical specs but the new copy is different than the older OOP Image set.  The Image set was listed as 1.33:1 AR but the new set is 16:9 widescreen anamorphic.  The film comprises original WWI vintage BW film intermixed with still photos and recent color footage of the towns and countryside of interest as they appear today.

Entertainment One got the set onto 3 discs whereas Image required 4 discs.  If the Image set truly was 1.33:1 AR then the new set is vastly superior as the film makes extensive use of the widescreen format in its composition.  The quality of the BW film footage varies but the modern color footage is of high quality.

Ten episodes of 50 minutes each.  I've watched the first three thus far.  Knowing what I do I strongly recommend the new set versus looking for a copy of the Image set.",1400630400,25,872,4.503184713375796
6290471,4,B00IS6WPT2,"To Arms 1914
The complex origins of the Great War, and how seemingly insignificant local tensions in the Balkans exploded into World War

Under the Eagle 1914 - 1915
The German invasion of Belgium and France was brutal and fanned the flames of war

Global War 1914 - 1916
The European Empires clashed all across the world, from the South Atlantic Seas to the plains of Africa

 Jihad 1914 - 1916
The Turkish Ottoman Empire proved a formidable foe, as Allies found to their cost at Gallipoli and in the Middle East

Shackled to a Corpse 1914 - 1916
As the Germans and Austrians clashed with the Russians on the bitter Eastern Front, Italy became embroiled in a terrible slaughter

Breaking the Deadlock 1915 - 1917
The Somme and Verdun saw carnage on an unprecedented scale, as armies fought to break the stalemate on the Western Front

Blockade 1916 - 1917
The war at sea was every bit as bitter as the war on land. The battle at Jutland proved inconclusive, but the U-Boat menace threatened Britain as never before. Meanwhile America entered the war.

Revolution 1917
The effects of The Great War shattered nations, inspired mass mutinies by desperate troops, caused great upheaval on the home front and changed the world forever.

Germany's Last Gamble 1918
Over 1 million German troops were committed to Kaiserschlacht - the last great offensive of the war, while conflict still raged on many other fronts

War Without End
The dramatic Allied victory at Amiens led to victory in just 100 days and the signing of a bitterly resented peace, while other nations stumbled towards their own ceasefire agreements",1395964800,66,1609,4.818181818181818

6290483,5,B00IS6WPT2,"Quite comprehensive and covers less-popular topics, highly recommend this for introduction to the breadth of impact of the war. When last episode ended, I just wanted more.",1503360000,2,172,5.407407407407407
6290484,3,B00IS6WPT2,"The approach of this documentary is to build it out of observations and quotes from a wide variety of generally obscure individuals  -  an interesting take, but vulnerable to cherry-picking and more than a little misleading in many places. Not a single recognised authority is interviewed, the result being more a history of personal human suffering than military or political accuracy  - and I am sure there is more footage of corpses here than in necrophiliac's film festival.

Nonetheless, it has some interesting and useful vignettes which are usually ignored by mainstream productions, but as already averred, some episodes are so painfully simplistic that they are actually mischievously misleading eg. the discussion of the factions/factors that precipitated the outbreak of the war completely exonerates all  -  except the Central Powers of course. France in particular is portrayed as utterly innocent of any complicity in the outbreak, and generally presented as virtue personified and the victim of 'Hun militarism'  -  the fact that it had invaded German territory 31 times in the previous two centuries is conveniently omitted.

Perhaps more unfortunately (because the events occurred more than a century ago), most episodes have a strange barely concealed Germanophobic bias, (but produced and directed by Marcus Kiggell and Corinna Sturmer et al??) some so blatant as to suggest and imply that the 'usual' barbarities of war ( ie. the brutalities, savagery, looting and general excesses etc - they forgot raping for some reason?) were the exclusive proclivity of the 'bestial Hun'  - no other combatants stooping that low.

Similarly, every idiotic utterance of the Kaiser is faithfully reproduced, but his English cousin's equally inane comments are tactfully omitted (not that royalty has ever been known for profundity)

Thus overall, although sprinkled with a few different and interesting insights and of course rare restored footage (corpses aside), its simplistic and slyly slanted treatment qualifies it as being 'definitive' only in a propaganda sense.",1503014400,3,2076,5.453125

6290488,3,B00IS6WPT2,"This series focuses mainly on the political aspects of the First World War.  While it was informative on that part of the subject, I was looking more for what the combat soldier went through, and there is very little of that.  Also greatly neglected in the series, was the part the airmen played in the battles.  Not only with the single engine aircraft in aerial combat , but with the two-seat reconnaissance pilots who, with great courage, flew slow and vulnerable aircraft to gather photos of the lines and spot artillery positions.
The series 'Apocalypse, WWI' is far superior but it is no longer available, sorry to say.",1494806400,,625,4.768518518518518

6290537,5,B00IS6WPT2,"This is a 10 episode study of World War I.  What I liked about the series that it dealt with the World War of the war. There was an Episode about the war fought against the Turks in the Mid-East, war in parts of Europe that were never discussed in school or most text books.  A lot of the film is actual footage from the war and interesting to watch.  World War I was the end of the Aristocracy in Europe.  The Russian Czar lost is life and brought to an end the Romanov rule in Russia, The rule of the German Kaiser was replaced with a democracy called the Wimmer Republic, The Turkish lost their hold on the Mid-East and set the stage for the creation of Israel and further Arab conflict in the region.  Each episode is full of interesting historical facts and stories.  It has been 100 years since the beginning of War.  The War to end all War's set the stage for World War II.  We mostly think of WWI as endless tedious trench fighting, but as this documentary shows there was so much more to the war than just men running into machine gun fire after climbing from mud soaked trenches. This is a very well done documentary and worth watching.",1431820800,18,1146,4.273148148148148

6290561,5,B00IS6WPT2,"I first watched this series on the Military Channel years ago and when I saw it here I knew I had to have it! This collection is by far the best documentary on World War I I've seen.

The Pros:

The narration is very well scripted and informative. Never once was I lost on what was going on.

Each of the ten episodes focus on a different aspect of the war, from Turkey's motivations and participation in the war to the beginnings of the Russian Revolution.

The backgrounds and motives of the major players of the war are explored, adding to understanding of the conflict.

Great quotes from soldiers and political figures from both sides of the fighting.

Greater encompassing of the scale of the war. Something that I've noticed with many productions on World War I (at least here in the US) is that they tend to focus on the Western Front and ignore the other theaters of combat. This documentary shows the viewer the other areas of operation of the war, from south and east Africa to actions in the Pacific Ocean.

Shows how the peace treaty at Versailles in many ways led to the outbreak of World War II some twenty years later.

The Cons:

It would've been interesting if the series also touched on the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War in 1918. They knew the Bolsheviks were pulling Russia out of the Eastern Front; so Britain, France, America, and Japan invaded Russia to defeat the communists and bring the country back into the war. The operation was ultimately moot once Germany surrendered later that year, but it was also part of the overall conflict.

Like the above, I would've liked to see them touch on the Allied partition of Turkey and the subsequent Turkish War of Independence. But that in itself would be better told in a documentary of its own.

Ultimately those are minor quibbles that don't take away my enjoyment of this series. I'd highly recommend The First World War to anyone who's interested in ""the war to end all wars."" You won't be disappointed!",1418774400,33,1991,4.611898016997167
6290562,3,B00IS6WPT2,"Almost very good. What is in the series is great. But they left out a lot, a whole hell of a lot. Some things were mentioned, barely. Examples: their were planes used a reconnaissance, someone dropped a bomb this one time so they did a bit more now. Oh and their was this Red Barron dude who had a flying circus. he killed about of guys but he was shot down so the British buried him with flowers and gun salutes.(done) By the way, this was spread out between episodes, so if you got a soda during the 3 times airplanes were mention. you missed it.
The Middle East is mentioned, Lawrence was this guy who blow up RR with Arabs and English lied about giving Arabs freedom.(Done) Considering this is the start of the Middle East hating the West so much, they could have added more than 2 min.
OH and the Americans didn't want to declare war, Allies wanted them, Germans didn't but weren't too worried about it. Then the Americans came. They sucked but it gave the British moral so we won. (done)
The French were mentioned a couple of times, mostly about how many men were killed by the offensive strategy.
 Lots of stuff about the refuges, hunger, . Ok civilians suffered too, do we have to show it after every battle? People are hungry
On and On  about how hard work it was at home. Women had to work a lot and it was dirty with long hours, we get it.
National moral National Moral....Propaganda Propaganda. They show entire movie theater commercials ""loose lips sink ships"" stuff. Yeah, got it.  more on food shortages. give it a rest.
More time was spent on Italians that surrendered, the Irish rebellion, Germans being sinking of the Lusitania, and other things that could have taken about 5 minutes to mention.
I'm being a bit flippant but seriously, so much was left out, I liked everything that was in it, lots of cool details but when you have so much detail but leave huge gaps in the story? Just add a few more hours. With so many episodes, a few more wouldn't have mattered.
 You can tell it was made in Britain, good thing because apparently they won the war mostly by themselves.",1416009600,7,2090,4.434895833333333

8644907,5,B00IS6WPT2,It was very thorough and very educational. I also learned much more about the political dynamics. I highly recommend this three disc compilation for serious history buffs. You won't be sorry.,1521676800,,191,5.193548387096774
8644908,5,B00IS6WPT2,"Product came as advertised and in mint condition.  Overall, very satisfied and would purchase again from this seller.  As for the series itself, I found it to be a nice sampling of key events and situations that occurred during the First World War.  An enjoyable watch for those who are fans of this material.  How much is new to you though will depend on your how much exposure to the subject matter you have had previously.",1519430400,2,425,4.552631578947368
8644909,5,B00IS6WPT2,"A great documentary of the ""Great War"" and what made it so ""Great""?:  the extreme loss of life (ie, senselessness of war), trench warfare, and how a tribal war can engulf the entire world  with JUST the assassination of an oligarch and his wife at the beginning of the 20th century.  It comes with 3 discs, multiple episodes with real-time black and white film and scenes after (ie, how battle fields etc. look today in color).  A great collector's item of a World War that led up to the start of WWII.",1518652800,3,502,4.423913043478261
8644910,3,B00IS6WPT2,"BEWARE:  This excellent series was shot in 4:3 format, but this boxed set of DVDs is in 16:9 format.  I know this because I've seen it several times, always in 4:3 format.  The result is that much of the visual content is missing, but there are lots of ridiculous close-ups, plus panning and scanning.
 Five stars for content.  One star for ruining an excellent documentary.",1515974400,,374,4.6923076923076925
8644911,1,B00IS6WPT2,"Horrible production values, essentially unwatchable. The music is especially overbearing and just an overall awful documentary experience.",1513468800,,138,7.176470588235294
