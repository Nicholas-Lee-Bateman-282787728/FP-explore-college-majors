1836462,1,B00008DDTI,"My husband and I hated this movie but my 11 year old son liked it.  I couldn't even sit through
the whole thing, the acting is poor and the plot is ridiculous.",1359676800,,159,3.96875

1836464,4,B00008DDTI,I like this film I saw this 27 years ago on the Disney channel...It is a good family movie. With action and adventure with no cussing.

1836465,5,B00008DDTI,"The simple life, when hard work made the soul push for excellence. Now we have people complaining, 17,000 a minute, because they are too lazy to spend a dollar a month on Sesame Street.",1349481600,,185,4.470588235294118
1836466,4,B00008DDTI,"Fun movie for the whole family - if a little predictable, the gorgeous scenery makes it well worthwhile. I grew up watching these films and still enjoy them. When I was small, the wildlife and mountains thrilled me; now as an adult mom, I must admit watching Robert Logan holds a bit more than a passing interest!",1328486400,,313,4.508771929824562

Great family movie to watch over & over again.",1431388800,,219,3.489795918367347
1836618,1,B00008DDTI,Horrible and depressing movie.  I won't bother watching the 3rd.  The first movie was okthis one was abysmal.,1428364800,,109,5.0

1836625,5,B00008DDTI,A wonderful wholesome movie!,1416182400,,28,6.25

1836665,4,B00008DDTI,"Loved it as a child, and I still love it as an adult! Great movie for a family movie night!",1401321600,,91,3.6
1836666,1,B00008DDTI,"The video quality was comparable to painting with a mop. Dim, grainy, and no talent at all. The video kept starting & stopping in a jerky fashion. The voice over was stilting and inane. An outstanding example of extereme amaturism. Sincw Amazon has no refud policy for movies, I'm stuck with the price!!",1396742400,,303,4.735849056603773
1836667,5,B00008DDTI,"Like the first one this is a really good family movie.  It is too bad that there are not more family movies like this one anymore.  This family had to work together to survive.  They became good friends with many of the animals but they also had problems with a few of the animals.  It is really sad that there are only three of these movies.  I wish there were many more and many more movies that a family could sit down watch and enjoy, most of the stuff on television now days is just pure garbage.",1396310400,,501,4.123711340206185
1836668,4,B00008DDTI,A five would have been perfect and I had a small issue that was resolved. So I rated a four.,1395705600,,92,3.65
1836669,3,B00008DDTI,"Well, Ehhh.  What can I say.  It was a followup to WF 1.  Ehhhh.  It was an OK family movie for an afternoon.",1394496000,,109,3.608695652173913
1836670,5,B00008DDTI,"As I said in my review of the first movie, the entire series of 3 movies is so inspiring.  I had these movies on VHS when my boys were young and now I have purchased these DVDs for the grandchildren.....they think I am so cool!  Buy them and enjoy your family time!",1393804800,,265,4.076923076923077
1836671,4,B00008DDTI,"Good sequel to the first, though I wish they would have kept the same actor for Jenny. The new actor did a great job, just would have been nice to keep the same family. This one moves a little slower than the first and has a few less animal encounters and action scenes but is filmed in the winter so it's fun to see the snow scenes. Kids LOVE the first one and like this one. I'm with them :).",1391644800,,394,3.9375
1836672,5,B00008DDTI,It's always good to be able to get back to the classics. Kids loved it and I didn't have to worry about censoring any inappropriate content which you seem to find so much of in today's movies. THAT is a true bonus!,1389139200,,214,4.119047619047619
1836673,5,B00008DDTI,My entire family enjoyed this movie very much.  My son enjoyed it very much because it had a wonderful family oriented story.  Would recommend to a friend.  Thanks to Amazon for having this wholesome family movie.,1386547200,,213,4.861111111111111
1836734,5,B00008DDTI,"Just like the first, we thoroughly enjoyed this one.  The winter comes this time and let's see how they survive this one.  Definite must see if you liked the first.",1384732800,2,164,4.433333333333334
1836735,5,B00008DDTI,I love this movie I watched as a kid I wish it was still on tv now days what a great show,1380326400,2,89,3.090909090909091
1836736,4,B00008DDTI,"This is goofy but it was fun to watch with our little kids. They were a little scared, but it wasn't too bad. We definitely got tired of the endless animal attacks. Not the best plot line, but entertaining none the less. Not exactly Swiss Family Robinson, but headed that direction.",1379030400,,282,4.549019607843137
1836737,4,B00008DDTI,"Good thing the first one was so incredible, or more of the same would have been really upsetting. But it was okay. I admit, I did just want more of the same. But the animal attacks and random severe, life-threatening illness thing is ridiculous. How can you even get sick living where there are no germs from other humans? It's nearly impossible. Trust me, I've tried.",1376179200,2,368,4.590909090909091
1836738,5,B00008DDTI,Fun family movie. Saw this movie years ago. Still a fun family movie. So happy I found this one. They are great for the whole Family.,1375228800,,133,4.153846153846154
1836739,5,B00008DDTI,This is a great show and a reason we don't watch much broadcast TV.  what is on TV anymore is just garbage with no moral values like this show.  We will be buying all the episodes and not worring about our children watching them as much as they want.,1373155200,,250,4.081632653061225
1836740,5,B00008DDTI,"The series was a great movie to watch with my kids, we all loved them!!  I would recommend these to any family.",1370995200,,111,4.045454545454546
1836741,4,B00008DDTI,"I have not seen this movie in a while, but me and my family saw it on amazon and deciced to rent it... it is a very beautiful movie, and we were all very impressed with the quality!",1366761600,,181,3.789473684210526
1836742,5,B00008DDTI,My kids keep begging to watch Part 3. They loved this and the first movie.  There are enough animals and gorgeous Rocky Mountain scenes to keep adults engaged too. Clean family fun.,1366156800,,181,4.65625
1836743,5,B00008DDTI,Rented this movie and watched with my 3 sons (6-10 yrs old).  They all enjoyed it.  I watched all of these movies when I was a kid and was glad to find them.  Good family movie.,1362182400,,177,3.861111111111111

7981845,4,B00008DDTI,I think this is a good movie for family night..,1517011200,,47,3.8
7981846,4,B00008DDTI,"The story itself is good.  This is the second installment of three movies about a family who, fed up with the smog and traffic of LA, and worried about the daughter's asthma, decide to sell out and move to the wilderness.  Not just the country, but the wilderness, where it's miles and miles to the nearest neighbor, let alone a town.  The problem comes with the fact that the movie was made to be a ""feel good"" family film showing idealistic scenery and scenes of them all playing in the snow, making pets of the animals, etc.  It's irritating to me because they simply have no sense at all.  In the wilderness, you don't go ANYWHERE without a gun.  The animals you encounter are likely to be bigger and stronger than you and, since this movie takes place in the winter, they will be hungry and wild animals WILL try to kill humans if they get hungry enough.  The parents have two kids; an older girl and an 8 year old boy.  The boy is little for his age and would be a prime target.  He is also incredibly thoughtless (I hated to say dumb) and is always doing things that endanger them, including breaking, not one, but TWO different radios.  Since your radio is your only lifeline to the world, you have to take care of it. Since they persist in doing things constantly that endanger them all; it's important that they have a way to call for help.  He also insists on keeping wild animals in the cabin with them (which caused the radio incidents) and one of them causes a fire in the cabin.  I could make a big list of the senseless and dangerous (to them) things that they are constantly doing or not doing in the three movies, but I won't.  Let's just say that this one and the other two are enjoyable but should not be used as examples of how to do things when you are out where wild things live.  In the wild, tests are given every day and failing the test can mean you die.  As you've probably  figured out, the movies annoy me, even though I think they are enjoyable in a way.  I just wish that the people responsible for making them had worried a bit less about making happy little ""let's enjoy nature and play with the animals"" films and a little bit more about portraying reality.  Still, most kids will like them and they could be turned into a learning opportunity as you discuss how NOT to act in the wilderness.",1493596800,,2327,4.32258064516129
