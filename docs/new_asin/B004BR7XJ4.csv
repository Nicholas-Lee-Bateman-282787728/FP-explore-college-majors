8422292,1,B004BR7XJ4,"Full Moon productions churned out some fairly decent horror in it's day...but what happened?

What's wrong with this stinker? Just about everything. The plot just drags along. This is a slow, slow, dull movie. It's ultra low budget. There are errors galore. For example, in the opening an old man and a young woman enter the building for an inspection. They start up a staircase together, but in the next scene, he is the only one to make it to the top. He has enough time to start the inspection through several rooms before he is killed. At that point, the woman arrives at the top of the staircase. What took her so long?

This movie is just bad, and not in a Ed Wood kind of way.",1323561600,2,683,4.328125
