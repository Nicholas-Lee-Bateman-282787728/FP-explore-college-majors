1200565,5,B00000F0HV,"At the outset, I must emphasize that I'm not reviewing this item as a whole.  Rather, I am only considering the abs workout.  I never tried the buns section, so please consult other reviews if that's what you're interested in.
At any rate, it is my hypothesis that more people have / will buy this video for the abs section than anything else.  So, the good news first:  I have lost nearly 40lbs in the past 4 months IN PART because of this exercise video.  However, it must be noted that I also rode my exercise bike 15 minutes a day & have been under a exceptionally restricted diet of deli sandwiches, lowfat / nofat milk & cereal and soups.  That said, this video did have something to do with my successfull weight loss.
Now the bad news:  if you want results, you HAVE to be consistent.  I know, I know;  saying this is a bit like a broken record, but it's true.  Doing this exercise video (or any other exercise video) a few times a week won't do you any good @ all.  Trust me on this one.
You start out with a 5 minute warmup.  So, the warmup + the 12 minute abs workout = 17 minutes.  The workout itself is pretty much what I've seen in articles in magazines such as GQ.  They might be tough @ first, especially if you're significantly overweight (as I was when I started).  They will get easier gradually, IF you do them consistently.  The trick of doing the exercises is to do 3 things simultaneously:  1)  Breathe  2)  Tighten up your stomach muscles - make your abs do all the work  3)  Do the exercises themselves while doing 1 & 2. Just remember:  if your abs are sore, that means the program is working!
Joining Kathy for the exercises are 4 people; 2 guys, 1 girl + Kathy's mom.  Be forewarned, much of the commentary by Kathy's mom & one of the guys is exceedingly annoying.  Once I got the sequence of the program down, I muted the sound ever after and did the program either in silence or with a CD going on the stereo.
One more note:  pay attention to the way Kathy does the individual exercises.  The other 4 people gundeck about 90% of them.  If you do the program the way they do, you'll be wasting your time.  I'm actually surprised that Kathy let the video out with so much of it half-baked insofar as the other participants are concerned.
I would highly recommend this video to anyone who wants to get in better shape and / or lose weight.  Remember:  if you happen to be obese, it will take more than losing weight alone to make you look good.  Exercise programs like these are designed to reshape your abs, and that's what is needed to tighten up your stomach muscles.",1011744000,8,2597,4.301652892561983
1200566,5,B00000F0HV,"I've done many ab workouts and I have never seen such great results as what I got with this video. This is the first time you can actually see my six-pack! And it's great because it's short! About twelve minutes a day and there's a workout for every day of the week M-F. But, because it's short if you need to loose body fat you should also do cardio to see the results better. Kathy is a very qualified fitness instructor, unlike many of the models that put out aerobics videos. She teaches the correct form on all the excersizes and how to modify them if you can't keep up. I would definately recomend this video to anyone.",985651200,17,625,4.305084745762712
1200567,5,B00000F0HV,"All I can say is Wow! I have never been a big fan of exercising because it always feels like it takes forever. I end up watching the clock and trying to figure out how much time I still have left. But with this video I never looked at the clock. I got a great workout, but it went by fast. I feel like I could do it two times over if I had the time. It's a great video for anyone who is just beginning a routine. It's working for me great so good luck.",984441600,7,452,3.71875

7906344,5,B00000F0HV,I love this VHS tape I did this work  many years ago and had great results. Unfortunately my tape was damaged when it came . But the good news is I got 100% refund.,1434499200,,164,3.823529411764706
7906345,5,B00000F0HV,I LOVE THIS EXERCISE VIDEO IT IS NOT TOO STRENUOUS AND IT REALLY WORKS. IT REALLY KEEPS ME IN SHAPE WITHOUT TRYING. THANKS AMAZON AND KATHY.,1342656000,,140,4.423076923076923
7906346,5,B00000F0HV,"Love this workout!!!! Easy workout to follow; you burn calories and see results (as long as you stick with it :-).  It can also be easily modified for those who cannot yet complete the exact workout. For example, when she ask you to put your legs straight in the air and then lift in order to work your lower abs, you can easily put your bend legs in a chair and then to crunches, which also works your lower abs. When doing staying leg exercises you also do not (at first) raise your legs as high as they do on video. Get the video, watch it, and then work it to your best ability. You will love how you feel and how you look afterwards.",1313884800,,638,4.104
7906347,4,B00000F0HV,"It's hard to keep up with when you first start out, but all 3 workouts are great & you can go at your own pace. I'd definitely recommend it. I do one 12 minute workout each day after doing some aerobic exercises, & I started seeing a difference after just a few weeks.",1124582400,,268,4.0754716981132075
7906348,5,B00000F0HV,"i really like this tape. the workout is challenging but well paced and after nearly two weeks i am definitely seeing results in my biggest problem area: the ABS!

my one peeve is that the audio seems a bit muffled but that could be this particular copy of the tape, but its just at the beginning and clears itself up right away.",1117756800,,328,4.290322580645161
7906349,5,B00000F0HV,"I have only used the ab portion of this video, but the results are great and quick. I do not have the flattest belly, but when I use this I can see a huge difference within a week or two. The best part is that you only need to really do it 3 times a week, minimum. The reason I think it works is because, though it is only 12 minutes, it's 12 minutes non-stop ab work. As soon as you start saying ""ouch"" she moves onto the next exercise. I've lost my original copy so I just ordered a new one........I'm so glad it's still in print. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1081296000,3,552,4.027272727272727
7906350,5,B00000F0HV,"Yeah! I am so excited to find that this video is still available. I worked out to this video every afternoon in high school and it was really and truly my favorite workout tape. Unfortunately, my VCR ate the tape a few years back and I have been unable to find another copy. Now that I have finally located another copy, I will DEFINITELY be purchasing this one and putting it back into rotation. I really like Kathy's attitude. She is encouraging without being too perky, and she emphasizes proper form. Also, Kathy suggests that you work up to all the reps (valuable advice in this case). Some of the other folks in this video are dowmright goofy, but this can be a good thing if you enjoy making fun of others during your regular workout, as I do (I find the male excercisers in this one particularly hilarious for some reason). Oh, yeah, one more thing. After your first few workouts with this one, you will probably be wanting to dog-cuss Kathy to the ends of the earth - it's a toughie, especially the ab section.  BUT, stick with it, because I swear it's effective. Once you master all the movements, you can actually FEEL yourself getting stronger and yes, much more toned and sexy. You will come to crave your time with Kathy, and on your days off you will miss the sight of that old guy (who I'm sure will crack you up, too)!",1042761600,5,1335,4.4048582995951415
