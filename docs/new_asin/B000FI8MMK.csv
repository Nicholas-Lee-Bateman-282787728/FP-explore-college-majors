(At which time I was too young and naive to suffer.)",1154131200,3,309,4.618181818181818

It stars the great Barry Prima too. One of the best fantasies out there and this gorgeous transfer from Mondo Macabro is truly eyepopping. Be sure to check out the Prima interview... very very strange!

Highly recommended",1149984000,6,393,4.954545454545454

8122649,4,B000FI8MMK,"Little in this world is more other-worldly than foreign sword and sorcery films.  Don't believe me?  Watch Conquest (1983), Lucio Fulci's Italian lunacy.  But for now let's focus on southeast Asia

A meteor crashes to Earth near some sort of elderly Zen monk dude, who then uses its ore to forge a sword--called the ""Devil's Sword"" for probably no other reason than a poor translation to English.  Because why not, right?

We are then introduced to the Invisible Queen who, after the butt-naked sacrifice of a young Indonesian warrior, becomes renamed the Crocodile Queen for the remainder of the movie and summons a harem of men for a public make-out session to appease her carnal desires (which apparently require no nudity).  At this point you're already thinking ""this makes no sense.""  Trust me, I know.  There was no better way to explain the story so far.

At first the plot seems to be about combating this Crocodile Queen's lust for male sacrifices, but then we steer in the direction of insurrection among her assassins who are all willing to kill whomever they must (including each other) to claim the ""other"" Devil's Sword and rule all of the warriors of the world.  So we saw an old guy forge onebut now all the sudden we are to understand there are two?  Sure.  WTF do I have to lose.

The action in this fantasy/martial arts movie is insane and abundant--and abundantly insane.  It's a combination of classic kung fu theater and horrible knockoff Hong Kong cinema.  We have long fight clips with choppy choreography--some of it lame and simple, some of it technically cool, but none of it matching the modern technically sound work of Tony Jaa (Ong Bak, Furious 7), Scott Adkins (El Gringo, Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning) or Iko Uwais (The Raid: Redemption, Merantau).  It smacks a dash of Riki-Oh: The Story of Riki (1991)not to the same slapstick level, but with several severed heads rifling through the air and Dragonball-kicking a boulder and then ""riding"" it to your destination does give it quite a cartoon feel.

Complementing the lunacy are scenes of summoning crocodile men from the earth who teleport-hop all over the place, surgical amputations, a lame cannibal pit, warriors burrowing in the sand like Tremors (1990), water crocodile warriors, an undead boatman, a dungeons and dragons lair complete with booby traps and secret doors, the worst ever Cyclops monster and laser beams.  Yes, I said laser beams!  Complete lunacy!

Director Ratno Timoer would later go on to do Revenge of the Ninja (1984), not to be confused with the ""other"" famous B-movie Revenge of the Ninja (1983).  In other words, you probably haven't heard of the cheap knock off he directed.  And while Devil's Sword is no obvious knock off--it's somewhat original in its own insane little microcosm-- it's to be treated as one when making a serious (or completely unserious) choice in whether or not to watch it.",1459468800,,2918,4.874239350912779
8122650,5,B000FI8MMK,"DVD Review: The picture quality is Grindhouse good in 2:35 ratio and the sound is HAPPY! The extras includes some historical thing on swards and a Barry Prima featurette which I don't care about.

Movie Review: I think this is a sequel to The Warrior. I don't f***in' know. Anyways this is like The Warrior movie with lousy choreographed martial arts action, blood and some gore, neat characters, horrid acting, silly FX and a story. The major downfall to this film is the pacing. The sex scene was horrible and at time the fight scenes can get tedious. But it's not enough for me to feel disappointment. MY FAT WAS STILL ENTERTAINED!!

Conclusion: 5 stars for the DVD and 4 stars for The Devil's Sword",1433203200,,702,4.608
8122651,4,B000FI8MMK,"When Mondo Macabro declares that it trucks in ""the wild side of world cinema,"" they're not exaggerating. That's more than marketing. Here's a release to prove it (you can add it to the list that includes ""Queen of Black Magic"" and ""Mystics in Bali""). Capitalizing on the thankfully short-lived 80s sword and sorcery boom whose best film, arguably, is the still not very good ""Conan the Barbarian"", Indonesia turned out one of its takes on the genre in 1983. I'm happy to report that THE DEVIL'S SWORD is more entertaining by far than the American stuff hitting the screens at the time. Might not have been as ""serious"" a film but it's a lot more entertaining. THE DEVIL'S SWORD has as much to do with martial arts cinema as the fantasy genre, though the latter is far from ignored. There are tons of crazy fight scenes with improbably feats, decapitations and amputations, jumping around, sword-swinging - there's even a warrior crone who gets cut in half and decapitated and still manages to keep things together. But the villain of the piece is the Crocodile Queen whose cave domain is underwater apparently (though it suffers from none of the effects you'd expect being underwater and all), complete with a bed that, rather than being four poster, instead is nestled in the giant stone maw of a croc's mouth. There's also a croc statue slash killing mechanism over near the fire pool. This doesn't even begin to describe the wacky that wanders amok throughout the movie. THE DEVIL'S SWORD keeps sailing right along at a nice clip - no worries on pacing here - and throws weirdness after weirdness at you. If you've seen heavily fantasy laden martial arts movies from China circa the 70s/80s and you suffered through any interminable 80s Western sword and sorcery epics, then you begin to get an idea of the insanity being channeled quite deliberately it seems by the filmmakers. Our hero, played by Barry Prima, who got some recognition outside his homeland, runs up not only against the croc queen in his quest for the titular sword - fashioned from meteorite metal by a wizard, so it's pretty bad-ass (I guess, since the film doesn't actually put it to much use, preferring to use it as a MacGuffin) - but also other warriors hellbent on getting their hands on the weapon. Everything here is over the top, which is pretty much what I've come to expect from Indonesian genre cinema, but that's exactly why it works. Example: Prima's character kicks a giant rock, sending it flying through the air, then JUMPS ON IT TO USE IT AS A RIDE. (Very Remo Williams, if you ask me.) Yeah. Example: The most ridiculous crocodile men soldiers ever, even if there never were any other such things in other films. Goofy special effects. Gore. And bizarre ideas whose conceptualization in a script meeting somewhere I can't for the life of me visualize. ""Hey, how about this completely random thing nobody's thought of happens?"" Well, it works. I'm pleased. And that's what counts.",1370304000,2,2970,4.780155642023346
8122652,3,B000FI8MMK,"This is an Indonesian sword & sorcery epic, built around the country's top leading man, Barry Prima, a tae kwon do expert and fairly handsome guy if not exactly a great actor. There was a huge and worldwide, if fairly short-lived upswing in cheapo barbarian/fantasy films in the wake of the success of CONAN THE BARBARIAN (1982) - dozens of crappy American and Italian films in particular featuring beefy loin-cloth clad bodybuilder-types and equally scantily clad ladies - and Indonesia's burgeoning film industry seems to have turned out quite a few of them as well, though they're not so well known in the west. This looks to be one of the more popular in the genre and it's probably an appropriate choice for my first-ever film from the country.

The story can be dispensed with fairly quickly - the movie does, why shouldn't I? At the beginning, ominous electronic music (the score throughout is like cheap John Carpenter) signals the forging of THE DEVIL SWORD!!!!  Old master-dude finds a meteorite and forges a sword in primitive conditions...cut to evil sorcerer-queen underground who has grown weary of her male sex-slaves and wants a new one - she sends her best henchman to steal a young bridegroom away from his wedding. Cool if cheesy effect as the evil warrior appears on top of a mountain, knocks a piece of rock off and flies down to the village on it. Travelling swordsman/martial artist Mandala (Barry Prima) appears in the village just as evil warrior has dispatched most of the town's top fighters (as in a great many martial arts films, everybody it seems can go kung fu fighting), fights him but is beaten as the bad guy summons magical help in the form of crocodile-people. Bad guy goes off with bridegroom, while the bride (the best fighter of the villagers) is left alone.

Our hero leaves too, to visit his master who it turns out is the heir to the secret of the Devil Sword, desired by good and bad warriors and magicians alike (this is one of those films where everybody is, in fact, good or bad and they even refer to themselves that way -- subtlety ain't what you should be looking for here). The master has been gravely injured in battle. After seeing to him, our hero goes off to find the devil sword, and after joining up with the bride from the previous scene, we're off to save the sword and defeat the evil queen.

Basically there is an action-to-plot/talk ratio of about 3:1 here; very brief and minimal expository scenes are followed by quite lengthy martial arts sequences that are mostly quite cheap-looking and not well-choreographed -- but who cares? Nothing makes much sense, the widescreen photography is great, the English dubbing is awesome (all the men sound pretty much the same; there are some great insults thrown around like ""you'll...regret this, you...polluted [...]"", said during a long death scene by a warrior to the old witch who helps to kill him) and the special effects would have looked bad in some 50s American sci-fi films.  Lots and lots of decapitations, spears through chests, etc, and the Devil Sword turns out to be pretty much nothing.",1254960000,,3106,4.765799256505576
8122653,5,B000FI8MMK,"The reason why this movie for me excels leaps and bounds above the works of Lynch and Shinya Tsukamoto (Tetsuo: Iron Man) is because the makers of this movie don't even seem to be aware just how damn strange a film they are making. People are tossed in the air, impaled, then ridden like flying surf boards, there are kingdoms of massive glowing mushrooms, every fight is a mind bending implausible atrocity of physics accomplished by wires, gore and deranged ""oh no you didn't"" editing tricks.

Mainly, I was rolling on the floor laughing the entire time, if you're really into film and want to see what happens when one dares to ""go there"" check this monstrosity out. I love this movie!",1244592000,,688,4.639344262295082
8122654,3,B000FI8MMK,"""The Devil's Sword"" is a tough movie to get your mind around: it's an Indonesian fantasy film inspired by Dungeons and Dragons featuring some of the worst production values ever. The film opens with a crazy old guy making a magical sword, and abruptly changes course to show us an underwater village in Indonesia where they are welcoming the ""invisible queen"" back from the briny depths. Through the spectacle of special effects (involving a towel dangling on a string by the looks of it) the queen becomes visible: she is revealed to be the ""crocodile queen,"" and has decorated her abode accordingly. Please note the tasteful bed in the giant golden jaws of a crocodile, and the large gold crocodile statue ornamenting her personal fire pit. Around this time in the film the credits decide to show up, and continue to do so intermittently for about the next fifteen minutes. The music (by Gatot Soedarto) is an annoying 1980's electronic variety and plagues the film for the duration; likewise, please note that E. Muksin Hamzah edited the film. Perhaps someone could take away his scissors now; this is one of the choppiest, most ineptly presented films ever.

The premise of the film is that the queen has an insatiable desire for young men, so she sends for her evil minion and uber-warrior, Banyu Jaga (Advent Bangun) to capture a young groom from a wedding. Banyu Jaga interrupts the wedding to kidnap the groom, but, starting a trend, fighting breaks out. There is magic and sorcery to go along with a lot of leaping around, kung fu, and knifeplay. The fight seems to last forever, but just when the issue seems decided the good uber-warrior, Mandala (Barry Prima, Indonesia's biggest film star) shows up, and it starts all over, but not before mystical ""crocodile men"" emerge from the ground (wearing hilarious costumes) to confound the forces of good.

Mandala's guru is then bitten by a red snake which results in huge amounts of blood on his pants, and knees that look like gangrenous coconuts: it turns out that the best treatment for this condition is amputation by white-hot sword, but only after Mandala finds exploding, glowing mushrooms to help with the first aid process. (Mr. Hamzah does us no favors in the comprehensibility department here.) After surgery the guru explains that the forces of evil are trying to eradicate all the good warriors from the earth, which leads to a flashback of the guru battling the four evilest warriors in the world, whose chosen weapons are a stick, a whip, hooked knives, and a flying wok on a string (capable of pulling peoples heads off.)

Mandala and the wife of the kidnapped loser seek revenge on horseback. The queen's pot of glowing gravel shows her that they are heading for ""the Mountain of Swords,"" to get the devil's sword. Along the way there is a battle with alligator men on a raft piloted by a skeleton. I am still laughing about the alligator that got beheaded, but still dogpaddled away after arterial spurting reminiscent of the lion in the ""Scott of the Antarctic"" sketch in ""Monty Python's Flying Circus."" Needless to say, the four evil guys also want the sword and show up first, with Banyu Jaga wearing ultra-masculine culottes. The evil foursome decide to fight to the death for the right to the sword (crocodile men join the fisticuffs as well,) and after much mayhem resembling the ""Three Stooges"" (especially the ""eye poke"" gag...really) Banyu Jaga kidnaps the jilted wife while Mandala finds the devil's sword in a bat-infested cave protected by the most ludicrous Cyclops in cinema history.

When emerging from the cave Mandala and Banyu Jaga go at it again first with conventional weapons, then with laser beams from their wrists. The battle ends in a draw, but Banyu Jaga is punished by the queen for failing to bring her the sword. This is when we first realize that her large decorative crocodile statue is not only stylish, but functional, too, as it blasts Banyu Jaga with fire and laser beams.

Mandala and the jilted wife swim to the queen's cave. I bet you can't guess what happens next. I'm sorry, ""more fighting"" is the correct answer. The queen hypnotizes Mandala, and the guru and the guru's guru telepathically intervene to snap Mandala out of the spell. We then learn that the queen is really ""the devil in disguise,"" and not the one Elvis sang about: she turns into a hideous hag and uses her scarf as a weapon (and a walkway) during the ensuing battle with the forces of good. Only Mandala and the husband and wife duo make it out of the cave alive, though the queen's status is unclear as she first turns from hag to crocodile then disappears into the swamp. After a bit of marriage counseling, Mandala rides away on horseback majestically.

This film is beyond bad on a conventional scale, but I gave it three stars for camp value. The DVD also features several extras including the trailer (wonderfully cheesy) and an interview with Barry Prima, who seems cantankerous. Please also note the biography of Prima, where we find he was born Bertus Knoch, and that he has come out of retirement recently (2006) to play a cross-dresser in ""Reality, Love and Rock 'n' Roll."" If you are looking to laugh at a movie, this one definitely fits the bill, though I recommend it only for hardened veterans of grade-Z films. The extras note that the film is ""one of the best Indonesian fantasy films,"" but one major newspaper recently ran a review of the film with the much more appropriate headline ""The Citizen Kane of Crap."" You be the judge.",1171929600,5,5532,4.763295099061523
8122655,1,B000FI8MMK,"But it is not.

Hey, I'm no snob.  I love horrible films, the ones so bad that you LOVE them. But this one does not cut it.

Yeah, there are a lot, in fact numerous, promising features to this film. Crocodile queen, glowing swords from outerspace, dudes running around in cheap alligator costumes, laser statues....but IT SUCKED!

I may laughed times but it was too far and in between. I think i laughed at the crocodile attack on the raft and when some chick got her head taken off but that was it.  Other than that, it wasn't memorable enough.

I had to watch it twice.  The first time I kept falling asleep.  The second time, I was annoyed I spent [...] on it.

I guess it all had to do with the pacing and lifeless acting and all the people who look like they have fish-faces and buggy eyes.  It was just there, like a piece of your mom's old furniture you keep around your apartment.  Lots of great ideas wasted on that crap-face named Barry Prima.

8122656,4,B000FI8MMK,"The Devil's Sword (1984) aka Golok setan came out at a time when the Indonesian film industry was thriving (it subsequently crashed in the 1990s), cashing in on various genres popular at the time including the fantasy genre, which came about primarily due to the popularization of the game Dungeons & Dragons in the late 1970s.  Directed by Ratno Timoer (Revenge of the Ninja), the film stars popular Indonesian actor Barry Prima (Primitif, Special Silencers), who's probably best known for his character Jaka Sembung from the `Warrior' films.  Also appearing is Gudi Sintara, Advent Bangun (The Warrior and the Blind Swordsman), Enny Christina, and Kandar Sinyo, most of who seem to have had a very limited career in film, appearing only in this feature.

As the film begins we see a wizened old man sitting on the ground, his meditations interrupted by a meteorite crashing to Earth.  From the meteorite the old man fashions a mystical weapon (it's very glittery) so powerful, he ends up stashing it away for fear it might fall into the wrong hands.  Anyway, seems there's evil power about in the form of a being known as the Invincible Crocodile Queen (Sintara), who resides in an underground lair (complete with crocodile motif) and takes sacrifices from a local village in the form of young men to satiate her lusty needs (which seem to be unquenchable).  As of late the village has been slacking, so the queen calls upon a powerful warrior minion named Banyu Jaga (Bangun), who appears from exploding rocks, to disrupt a marriage ceremony for the village chieftain's daughter (Christina) by kidnapping the groom, which he does.  Eventually this leads to another warrior getting involved, one named Mandala (Prima) as Mandala and Banyu Jaga both studied under the same master.  Eventually Mandala confers with his master, who was seriously wounded and left for dead while fending off an attack of evil warriors, to which the old man passes along the secret location to the Devil's Sword, which happens to now reside somewhere within the Mountain of Swords.  As Mandala starts off on his quest to retrieve the powerful weapon (with the princess in tow), the Crocodile Queen calls upon Banyu Jaga to recover the sword, the intent being to use it to rule the world...um, okay.  Turns out the sword is coveted by a number of Banyu Jaga's brethren, enough so they battle each other, all while Mandala makes the perilous journey to the mountain where he eventually must face off against a slew of even greater challenges, including a shoddy looking ten foot tall Cyclops guarding the sword.  As you can imagine things ultimately come to a head as Mandala and the princess (who's got some skills) end up facing off against the Crocodile Queen and her flunkies, many of which are dressed like crocodiles, in the age old battle of good versus evil...

This is one hell of a funky movie as the makers of the film seem to have taken a whole mess of elements, thrown them into a pot, mixed rigorously, boiled it up good, and spilled out the contents onto celluloid, the result being a story that doesn't make a whole lot of sense (there's a lot of little bits I filled in for myself based on speculation), but is actually entertaining in a markedly cheap and sleazy sort of way.  At the very least the story did have some linear qualities, so it really wasn't all that difficult to fill in the blanks once things got moving, and speaking of getting moving, know this, the opening credits are spread out through the first ten minutes which was kind of odd as while you're watching whatever it is you're watching, some credits will pop up initiating a `what the hell?' response.  What the story may lack in sense it makes up for in wild and wooly action sequences, which are spread fairly evenly throughout.  The choreography isn't all that hot, but I did enjoy the copious blood spurting sequences as various peons and flunkies meet their demise through numerous forms of dispatch including, disembowelment, amputation, decapitation, and so on...as is usually the case the villains were far more interesting than the heroes, sporting cat-o-nine tails whips, snake staves, flying guillotines, etc.  As far as Banyu Jaga, he utilized dual, curved swords that he would often stick together to form a wicked pair of hedge clippers, extremely useful in removing victim's body parts, particularly their heads.  And then there's the Crocodile Queen herself...as I said, she lives in an underground lair, her throne made up to look like the maw of a giant crocodile, surrounded by a legion of crocodile men (guys in cheap reptile suits).  Also present is a giant, silver crocodile statue, standing on its hind legs.  The statue is functional as well as ornamental, as it spews fire from its mouth along with laser beams from its eyes.  The queen, who's about the best looking female in the film (at least until the end when she reveals her true self), can often be found engaging in a group canoodle, taking on up to seven(!) guys at a time (I guess it's good to be the queen).  Surprisingly, given the amount of snogging within the film, there's almost no nekkidness, except for a faraway behind shot of some female minions.  There's a couple of really funny bits throughout the film, probably the funniest for me occurring during Banyu Jaga disrupting the wedding early on...nearly everyone gets involved in fighting Banyu Jaga including the villagers, the chieftain, his daughter (who's getting married), and so on...the only one who doesn't get into the scuffle is the groom, who seemed to me somewhat of a milquetoast, and certainly not worth battling a horde of enemies over to retrieve.  I did learn quite a bit from this film including the following...

1. The best swords are those forged from glowing meteorites.

2. Crocodile queens are easy to get into the sack.

3. Crocodile queens have a problem with snogging (they can't get enough).

4. A blessing from a crocodile queen usually involves some between-the-sheets action.

5. Boulders can be used as modes of transportation, specifically if you kick a large enough one into the air and then jump on top of it (that's one sweet ride).

6. A parasol can be used effectively to keep a powerful enemy at bay.

7. A cannibal pit is a useful feature for getting rid of minions who've outlived their usefulness.

8. The best way to deal with snakebite is amputation with a white hot sword.

9. If you want to keep a powerful, mystical sword out of the hands of evil, it's probably best to hide it somewhere other than in a place known as the Mountain of Swords as that'd be the first place I'd probably look if'n I were hankering to get my hands on it.

10. A flying guillotine weapons is a pretty cool way to remove one's melon.

11. Having a legion of crocodile men at your disposal is not as cool as it would seem especially given the fact they can not fight for squat.

12. The cycloptic guardian within the Mountain of Swords is ridiculously easy to beat (hint, go for the ocular strike).

13. One would think given the build up tied to a weapon in a movie like this (heck, it's even in title of the film) one would see a whole lot of action involving said weapon, but one would be wrong.

14. Nothing gives a fantasy film that `fantasy' feel like smoke emanating from tons of dry ice thrown in the water.

The picture on this Mondo Macabro DVD release, presented in widescreen (2.35:1), enhanced for 16X9 TVs, looks clean and decent, while the Dolby Digital stereo audio comes through clearly.  There are a few extras including a poor looking original theatrical trailer for the film, a featurette titled An Encounter with Barry Prima, which amounts to an impromptu interview with the star who doesn't seem all that keen on being interviewed, a text history about the film, a text piece titled Heavenly Swords: A History of the Sword, and a preview montage of other Mondo Macabro DVD releases.
