8241727,5,B0011FOVYE,The first 2 reviews really did a great job in explaining what this 3 workout set is comprised of. This particular set can only be obtained through the second hand market as it is no longer in print .. but.. it is a part of the Classical Stretch Vintage II Set. You will receive the 3 workout from this plus another 1 hour routine called Full Body II. Excellent buy at the CS Site for appx $45.00 + shipping. CS keeps me moving and flexible!,1367193600,8,440,4.188235294117647
8241728,5,B0011FOVYE,"The previous review thoroughly explains this DVD and I agree with her points.  I have been doing Miranda Esmonde White's original Classical Stretch workout for years and really find it the most thorough of all her workouts.  However, this 30 minute workout DVD comes very close the original Classical Stretch effectiveness in only half the workout time.  I recommend using the Original Classical Stretch workout DVD when you have a full hour and using these 30 minute workouts daily or when you can't fit in a full hour.  It complements my yoga and biking workouts nicely.

Miranda always picks beautiful spa settings and classical music for her workouts, so you find it more a mini vacation than a workout.  With three separate workouts on the DVD, you can pick what you want to focus on each day.  I prefer Poolside Garden myself because it mimicks the effect of Miranda's full body Classical Stretch workout.  I gave my copy away and regret it, I'll have to order another one...  Try it out and give your body a relaxing treat that you can really get used to!",1277596800,21,1062,4.697297297297298
8241729,5,B0011FOVYE,"This DVD was my first experience with Classical Stretch, an exercise system based on the PBS series led by Canadian instructor MIranda Esmonde-White (it's also known as the Esmonde Technique). It is difficult to explain exactly what it is like, although it incorporates elements of ballet, yoga, Tai Chi, and other disciplines. Most of the moves are performed in a gentle flow, somewhat similar to the video Yoga in the Garden of Serenity. You are stretching your body, but you are working it, too--in fact, the one thing that surprised me about this video was how challenging some of the moves were.

In addition to the three workouts, the video contains an 8.5 minute instructional portion. I would recommend that you watch this prior to trying any of the workouts, as Miranda explains proper stance (usually maintaining a pelvic tuck position), modifications, use of props, etc. Below are brief breakdowns of each of the three workouts on this DVD:

1) Spanish Hallways (performed in a covered outdoor area of a tropical hotel). I decided to try this workout first, as it was described on the DVD cover as ""Standing and barre workout: focus on upper body toning plus deep hamstring and hip stretches."" So, I thought I'd be mainly stretching my lower body, but I had to work it first! The workout begins with a vigorous warm-up--lots of arm movements and marching in place--and then moves right into a very challenging arm series. With all of Miranda's arm work, you are holding the arms up at shoulder level and then performing a variety of movements for as long as five minutes or so; even though you are not using weights, your arms will definitely be fatigued! Next she moves into some plie work for the legs which was also quite tough. She then incorporates a chair for barre work, using more range of motion than I've seen in other barre exercises. Finally, the last 8 minutes or so of this workout does contain some really nice stretches for the hips, hamstrings, and lower body in general; it concludes with some Tai Chi moves and a neck release.

2) Oceanside (like the name suggests, right on the beach at water's edge). This workout is described as ""Standing only: focus on tonigh upper body and arms plus improving posture."" I found this workout to be the most relaxing of the three, with a lot of movements that definitely did seem to stretch and release my upper body area, including the shoulders. There is a plie series in this one as well, but there are no additional leg exercises. There is also what Miranda calls a ""nasty little exercise for the arms"" towards the end where you will definitely feel the burn. Overall, however, this workout felt the most relaxing and gentle.

3) Poolside Garden (performed by the pool with the hotel garden in the background). This is the only workout of the three that incorporates floor work, and it's described as ""Standing and floor work: focus on upper body toning, plus abs and hip strengthening, groin stretches, and saddle bag reduction."" The first half of the workout is standing and focused mainly on the upper body; you'll do lots of stretching plus a short more challenging series. There is also a very brief plie segment before transitioning to the floor for abs work. Here Miranda is mostly performing variations on basic crunches, but I found that her form pointers helped me to feel the burn more, and so this segment was short but fairly intense. There is also some side lying work for hips/outer thighs, and then Miranda leads you into an excellent series of lying stretches for the hamstrings and lower body. Again, there is nothing really new here, but I like the way the Miranda instructs the stretches. She ends with a short series of stretches from a seated position.

In summary, I really like the variety of the three workouts (although there are some of the same moves in all three), and the 30-minute length works very well for me.  Also, I do yoga on a regular basis, but these workouts seem to offer something a bit different than what I get from my yoga practice.  Since I first purchased this DVD just over two years ago, I've acquired several more Classical Stretch DVDs which I use regularly; I feel that doing so has increased my flexibility and enhanced my yoga practice.  If you have never tried Classical Stretch before and are curious, I think this DVD is an excellent place to start, and I'd highly recommend it.",1249344000,37,4406,4.720416124837452
