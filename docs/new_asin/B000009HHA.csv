7905416,5,B000009HHA,"Sure it's a bit like Lethal Weapon, but then again, every buddy-cop movie is compared to that one.  The martial arts scenes are mainly handled by Conan Lee while Chow Yun Fat stays solid as a guy who can handle a gun fairly well and can hold his own in a fight even without the fancy moves.  On top of that, the comedy is great.  This movie has plenty of laugh-out-loud moments, especially the last line in the movie.

But of course, the main reason to see this movie is the finale, where they pull out all the stops, thrown in the kitchen sink and the kitchen, drop the bombshell, blow the roof off...  ahem, it's great.  Pistols, magnums, and shotguns are used (Chow makes pretty good use with his weapon using a really neat trick that will makes you clap your hands in glee), Conan uses his martial arts which don't stand out as much as the likes of Jackie Chan, but are still solid.  But the main thing that everyone remembers the movie for, the one thing that makes buying this movie a requirement for anyone who is a lover of actioners, is the chainsaw duel between Conan and the villain.  Oh man, I was blown away when I first saw that sequence, and it never gets old.  They use real chainsaws, the sparks really fly on impact, wood and vests and clothing really get cut up with each swipe, and they fight at such a hectic pace for fairly long takes it's amazing no one was killed making this sequence.  It is a masterpiece of action filming, up there with the shootout scene in Heat, the fight between Bruce Lee and Chuck Norris, Jackie Chan vs. Benny Urquidez, the finale in A Better Tomorrow 2, the car chase scene in Bulitt, etc.  That sequence is worth viewing of this movie alone, and is enough of a reason to give the movie 5 stars.  Chainsaw duel aside, the rest of the movie is a solid enjoyable popcorn flick that isn't meant to be taken too seriously.  Just have fun with it.",1311638400,,1893,4.328611898016997

7905418,4,B000009HHA,"Outside of Kowloon, Chow Yun Fat is seen as an action star, and who could be blamed for thinking so. Given the popularity of ""The Killer"" and the ""Better Tomorrow"" series, it seems that you couldn't  watch Fat unless he was racking up a body count. So, you can imagine how  much of a departure ""Tiger On The Beat"" may seem for him.
In  all actuality, Chow is an actor with a broad range, with most of his recent  Hong Kong films more drama-based than anything else. Still, he doesn't let  you down with this one.
Paired with a straight-laced cop (Conan Lee) Chow  is the Jim Belushi to Lee's Schwarznegger. Tracking a drug ring in Hong  Kong, the action comes at the right moments and the comedy is enough to  tide you over until the high-speed ending.
When compared to his more  well known work, this doesn't rank as high a body count, but with the  comedic edge, this is worth adding to any hard-boiled Woo fan's collection.  Oh, and is there anything cooler then when CYF brings out the machette?",912384000,,999,4.434065934065934
