Great love story and family values.

8218713,5,B000VI6T8S,These movies let you sink into them feeling like you're there. The characters in the movie fall in love without even knowing it until it's already happened. The scenery is magnigicent showing the great wide outdoors with vineyards being prevalent in both. Watch these with a loved one or by yourself. They're feeling movies that leave you feeling happy and moved.,1255046400,2,363,4.967213114754099
