8493355,5,B000VDNHRY,"A great, if grim, portrayal of the depredations and exploitation of young inmates within the Turkish prison system during the turbulent 1970s. Guney illustrates that there is no fundamental difference between political and economic prisoners living under a corrupt and barbaric dictatorship, indeed the prison itself stands as a metaphor for Turkish society under the generals, divided by the walls of many false divisions...The boys in the film, many unjustly held, are bullied by the 'top dogs' in the dormitory and are beaten and sexually abused by the black uniformed prison officers, they live out a miserable existance, half-starved, and forced to beg off the adult inmates.  The only glimmer of hope, or resistance to this system of tyranny, are the anarchist prisoners who, although segregated, present an organised, disciplined front against the authorities.  Their rebellion (which later inspires the boys to do likewise) is accompanied by the symbolic, visceral, birth of a child in the women's block- new life is created amidst the horror of the present...The boys bid for freedom through revolt ends with the realisation that there are no better prisons to go to, that they are all the same, and, by extension, society outside is a prison itself...
My only criticism of this print of the film are the subtitles, since I saw this many years ago on UK TV, some of the translations are a bit rough- and where the anarchist prisoners are referred to as the 'Comrades', this has been translated as the 'friends'.
Worth seeing if only because it was banned for so many years in Turkey for its 'subversive' content, and for the fact that Guney was persecuted for having made it in the first place...",1322352000,3,1705,5.0
