2152265,1,B0002ZDVFY,"The DVD is really a deception. All the experts invited are the ones that support Gnostic theory. I was hoping that I can see a balanced view related to this subject. Instead, I only see the point of view of the pro Dan Brown's experts. I think we should invite the famous evangelists, theologists, and scholars from the protestant, cathodic and liberal to discuss the issue. The DVD does not even discuss why the Gnostic theory was rejected in the first century.",1125964800,10,462,4.646341463414634
2152266,5,B0002ZDVFY,"I recently attempted to research the authenticity (or lack therof) of the Shroud of Turin. I quickly discovered that most sources are so biased that it was almost impossible to get any reliable information. I expected the same when I ordered this DVD, and was curious to see if DVD was ""for"" or ""against"" the ""Da Vinci Code"".  Imagine my shock when I found all of the speakers to be completely objective, in my opinion. I was so fascinated by what the speakers had to say that I have done a lot more research and have ordered several books on the subjects covered. I'm glad I ordered the DVD instead of the book version because it is much easier to judge the veracity of someone when you are watching them speak, instead of reading their words on a page.  I highly recommend this DVD to the many people who were intrigued by the ""Da Vince Code"" and want to discover how much of the book, if any, is true.",1123286400,8,904,4.34319526627219
2152267,5,B0002ZDVFY,"I took a chance buying this DVD based on the glowing reviews posted on Amazon.  I am very happy with my purchase!  While the production of the DVD is somewhat amateurish, the content is top notch.  If you are a fan of Dan Brown's novel, you will enjoy the many perspectives from the authors interviewed on this DVD, most of whom were resources for Dan Browns work.  I especially enjoyed the interviews with the eccentric but charming Henry Lincoln, author of Holy Blood Holy Grail.  Best of all, this DVD convinced me to read the source materials for Brown's novel, as all of the authors here present more theories to support a history that is quite different, and possibly more believable, than what has been handed down the last 2000 years.  Well worth the money, and it may inspire you to read more about the themes Dan Brown so eloquently (and cleverly) brought to millions in the Da Vinci Code.",1123113600,3,899,4.5875
2152268,5,B0002ZDVFY,This DVD is just stating the facts for you to contemplate on your own...definitely a must see for anybody who has a religion!,1110067200,6,125,4.478260869565218
2152269,5,B0002ZDVFY,"I picked up the Da Vinci Code about a year ago to read on a long train ride, and of course I wasn't disappointed-as we all know it was immensely entertaining and exciting, a great read all around (and now I can't wait to see Tom Hanks in the movie!) But then my husband Bernie, who noticed how much I liked the book (don't you just love it when men pay attention for once?) bought this DVD for me for my birthday. There was so much new information inside that I had to watch it several times, so I was glad that I owned it. I had never heard of ""Gnosticism"" before or any of the other stunning data contained inside, it was like a whole treasure chest opened up of stuff they never told you in Sunday school that makes religion exciting all over again. Now I've got Bernie reading the Dead Sea Scrolls! A great value for the money.",1100736000,60,831,4.167701863354037
2152270,5,B0002ZDVFY,"If you are looking for the expert dope on all things Da Vinci Code, this is it - no need to look elsewhere. Henry Lincoln, Dan Burstein, Picknett and Prince and even Dan Brown - basically everyone you'd want to explain the back story of The Da Vinci Code. The only omission is anything the naysayers who wrote lots of books denouncing the novel as anti-catholic, etc., but that's not to say that the people who are interviewed, especially Holy Blood Holy Grail's Henry Lincoln, don't question some of the wilder leaps made by some enthusiasts.

It's really well produced, and organized so that you can drop in or out of any chapter on the DVD to learn about whichever topics interest you most. If there was a criticism it would be that some of the talking heads really go into detail, perhaps more so than you might want - but that depends on your level of interest.

Overall, 5 stars and a suggestion to look no further, except perhaps Dan Burstein's excellent book Secrets of the Code and/or Martin Lunn's book Da Vinci Code Decoded, which despite having the same name as this DVD doesn't really cover the subject matter in the same way.",1100736000,62,1139,4.5512195121951216
2152271,5,B0002ZDVFY,"It's hard for me to describe the 9 million Americans and growing who have read The Da Vinci Code as a cultural clich - Dan Brown's novel has resonated with many people in this country who are curious about the roots of Christianity and its development throughout history.

As I watched this DVD, I didn't think Da Vinci Code Decoded was anti-ANYTHING. What Dan Brown and the other thinkers featured in this film discuss is who Jesus was - living as a Jewish man in Roman-occupied Palestine 2,000 years ago.  To speculate on how Jesus, as a man, might have lived in his time on this earth - in no way shape or form degenerates my faith or the beliefs of millions of Catholics and Christians in this country and across the world.

In fact, Henry Lincoln in the film explicitly makes this point.

I say watch it for yourself, and make up your own mind.  You probably will learn something new, I certainly did.",1100649600,96,906,4.466666666666667
2152272,1,B0002ZDVFY,"For those who enjoyed Mr. Brown's The Da Vinci Code, the 'movie already in his mind' thriller of religious and cultural cliche, you will dislike this DVD. Dan Brown appears for a short 20 seconds and is followed by a conglomeration of talking heads. Please enjoy the story from the reader/writer standpoint, as story, since it is fiction. Let this Decoded DVD rest on the shelf.

NOW, for those who see The Da Vinci Code as the watershed moment in religious/cultural span of `it all' and that this book has cracked open 2000 years of cover-up, lies, and dastardly Roman Catholic (usually Jesuitical trickery, but here clever substituted with Opus Deic trickery) behavior, you will get what you want in this roundtable of `undeniable scholarship and genius'.

However, be advised that these particular talking heads are 1) anti-Christian, 2) anti-Catholic, 3) not biblical scholars by any stretch of the imagination, 4) vain-glorious, Brit-accented pseudo-intellectuals. If THIS is what you are in search of, then, by all means, buy three copies, one for the neighbor.

This world of The Da Vinci Code is a clever, fictitious world of mythology and successful story-telling around the suspected religious/political view of Leonardo Da Vinci. Most folks do come to The Da Vinci Code, not for the story telling, but for the background and earth-shattering under-story of the true story of Jesus and Mary Magdalene. But for one, ie Mr. Dan Burnstein, to  say that ""Dan Brown is on pretty good historical ground"" is pure and absolute rubbish.

This book's historical ""fact-ion"" (not fiction) exist in a small pseudo-scholarly community of 4-5 strong, represented by Lunn, Picknett, Lincoln, Starbird, and Burstein. Their books are not works of biblical and historical exegesis but clever workings of what ifs into their own super-secular, often uber-feminist-minded (in the case of Mrs. Picknett), anti-Catholic world view. This `documentary' is a decoder ring developed by these aforementioned persons to understand simply the world they themselves have created and where they dwell.",1100563200,57,2079,5.268882175226586
2152273,5,B0002ZDVFY,"For those that have read Dan Brown's 'The Da Vinci Code' and have been inspired by his fabulous work, enough to seek out further knowledge, then this is the DVD for you. Be forewarned however that this isn't, under any stretch of the imagination, a light and easy going DVD..... you will have to pay attention to be able to appreciate the wealth of knowledge imparted by the seven renowned authors/professors and researchers ....

This DVD is divided into two sections, Chapters and Extras,  the first having five topics, and the second, Extras, nine topics of discussion ... The running time for these topics are anywhere from 37 minutes to 3 minutes depending on the material discussed. Actually, the difference between the Chapters and the Extras is ONLY the fact that the Chapters are dedicated to more specific discussion of Dan Brown's book and the Da Vinci references in the book.

Certainly one of the central themes of the DVD, and the book, is the 'sacred feminine' and the proposition that Jesus was, in effect, married to Mary Magdalene, and he had children by her.

For those viewers that have studied the the works of Da Vinci, the bible, theology or the history of the Christianity the authors in this DVD, particularily, Henry Lincoln, author of Holy Blood Holy Grail, will most certainly be known to you...

Certainly the origins of Christianity and the important role that the Roman General Constantine, having to fight with mostly very pacific Christian soldiers, is discussed in some detail and makes the viewer think about all those things that perhaps the Church never wanted us to think about. Constantine was one of the first that set the dates of Christian holidays so that they may more accurately fall at the same time as the pagan and sun worshippers of Rome, Greece and Egypt of the time. For example, there is no proof that Jesus was born on December 25th, nor is there any specific reason that if the birth of Jesus was pinned to one specific day, His the death and resurrection is also not a specific day, but rather a floating holiday that is pegged to crop and fertility cycles and, a Sunday after the first moon of the solstice... or something like that .... The Christian holidays fall on the same days as the old Sun and Pagan worshippers timetable ......

Just think, back in the days of Jesus, the most powerfull people were all considered the 'Son of God', most of them in Greek, Roman and Egyptian mythology were born of virgin mothers, since as you know many Greek fables .... where the gods used to come to earth and take advantage of the most beautifull virgins.... and of course as well the pagan religions of the day most certainly belived in the resurrection of the dead after 3 days .... The fact that the Christian God is monoeithic, God is still described as multiple with The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit ... HMMMMMM

OK enough of that, most of the DVD is done in a lecture form by the authors, there are some snippets of pictures of the Da Vinci works but, like I said, consider this DVD to be a two hour lecture ... FABULOUSLY, and clearly done. The authors do not speak down to the viewer while imparting a wealth of information for futher thought or study. It is by no means an anti-Christian work nor is it presented in a negative way to try to shake a religious person's faith, on the contrary, it makes one think more deeply about one's faith and the origins of the Christianity and the Church in much much greater depth that I ever got in Catechism class  ......

Finally, for Dan Brown readers that do not want to listen to this heavy lecture DVD, I strongly suggest you consider buying the 'Unlocking Da Vinci's Code' narrated by Patrick Mcnee ... a fabulous piece of work as well, but much much more specific to Dan Brown's book and with narrated tours of some of the churches and locations used in Brown's book ....

Two exceptional and thought provoking DVD's",1099958400,112,3923,4.615494978479196

8035253,4,B0002ZDVFY,"This DVD proved to be well balanced and informative. The commentary was by some of the better scholars in the field, in addition to the usual cast of characters that seem to appear in all of the Da Vinci documentaries.  The extras were well worth the 40 minutes to watch, and should be viewed in addition to the regular show.  I would have liked to see more on the development of the canon and early church history discussed, but in general the documentary actually proved to be one - not a fantastic tale or wild speculation.

8035254,4,B0002ZDVFY,"Dan Brown's DA VINCI CODE is pure fiction yet being based upon the latest theories about the Leonard, Da Vinci Jesus's bloodline and Holy Grail studies.

If you want to explore deeper into such studies upon which Dan Brown's bastseller novel based, this DVD is a nice guide.

While this DVD may serve well for Davinci Code enthusiasts, it lacks or ignores the serious criticism cast upon from a number of researchers and theologists. So it is by no way well-balanced and may not fit for the material for serious debate.

Enjoy it as pure entertainment. It gives you more insights than King Solomon's Mines series or Indie Jones series.

Verdict: Typically has the TV documentary flaw...For pro- Da Vinci Code fans.

8035255,2,B0002ZDVFY,"This was a poor attempt at capitalizing on the success of The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown. The book, which is wildly successful and has sparked controversy throughout the world, and the movie, which is milder but still controversial both attract a lot of attention. This DVD simply tries to take that attention and turn it in to profit for the producers.

There is nothing profoundly interesting about this DVD. There is no new information and the DVD fails to truly point at the myths and facts from the book/movie. It merely states what the book says and why the book says it or what the book is based on without any corroboration.

Truly disappointing to a conspiracy theorist at heart. I expected more.",1178409600,,705,4.632
8035256,3,B0002ZDVFY,"Update as of 4/3/07  (See below for update.)

I have watched this DVD several times after borrowing from my local library.  I give it three stars because I think it's worthy of at least looking at one point of view regarding the Da Vinci Code phenomenon, yet right now I have a few issues with it.

First, I personally do not agree with Dan Brown's assertion that (and I'm paraphrasing here) since the beginning of recorded time, history has ALWAYS been written by the winners.  I suppose it's because I'm very cautious about writing in ""absolutes"" as I've often found that new information will come along to disprove what was thought to be absolute.

As well, some of the transitions between interviews left me feeling annoyed at times because it appeared that the interviewee(s) may have had more to say.  This makes me wonder if the editing was done to serve the purpose of the subject of the DVD instead of presenting a more objective point-of-view.

I found it very interesting that Henry Lincoln, one of the co-author's of ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail,"" stated that his book had absolutely had no validity at all.  (I have the book, but haven't read it yet.)  In any case, my initial thought was then, ""Well, why write the book at all?""  Perhaps being an artist is where my confusion is stemming from.  What I mean is that in producing a work, to me it's valid to me, it's coming from some place inside of me that believes in what I'm doing.  So, I'm a bit perplexed here and if anyone has insight in regard to this, I'm open to hearing it.

I do personally agree with Lincoln that anyone can write any sort of document, but that doesn't constitute it's validity.  He also states that whatever we do know is based on heresay, guesswork and interpretation.  I'm still undecided about my thoughts on that.

In any case, I'll probably watch the DVD again and update my review as I let things sink in and continue my research.

That all being said, I think the DVD is worth watching.  I like to look at all sides of an issue and this is just another side to be taken into account and considered whether you agree with it or not.

UPDATE:

I am in the middle of reading, ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail.""  Hence, I can understand a bit more where Henry Lincoln is coming from when he states his book, etc. has no validity at all.  I do wonder if the statement is his way of getting off the hook at having written a book which, when you see, ""The Real DaVinci Code"" DVD proposes (and with a good deal of sense, although I don't like the interviewer's sarcasm) that the whole basis of the book is based on a hoax.  Ultimately, whether or not the ""facts"" were a hoax...I have absolutely no idea.  But I do tend to lean more on the side of the DVD ""The Real DaVinci Code"" after seeing it many times.  That being said, I'd look into all the info and determine for yourself.",1169251200,,2856,4.402671755725191
8035257,1,B0002ZDVFY,"Like most people, before I spend money on a DVD, I read all the cover descriptions first.

The back cover starts with a breathless announcement about Dan Brown's book. Then it lists a series of questions by the book's detractors.

Based on the cover description, I honestly thought this DVD was going to be a reasoned ""second opinion"" regarding the historical information that Dan Brown uses as part of his novel.

I had no idea that the DVD was actually just a rehash of the same theories minus the mystery-thriller context. I'm guessing the marketers deliberately meant to ensnare people of faith into thinking they were purchasing an opposing view.

This DVD should be called: ""The Da Vinci Code,"" Part Deux.",1148688000,7,711,4.851239669421488
8035258,1,B0002ZDVFY,"'Da Vinci Code Decoded' is merely an uncritical rehash of the same, supposed, 'facts' that Dan Brown attempts to put forth in his book, much of which was co-opted from 'Holy Blood, Holy Grail' (as Mr. Brown himself attributes in his book).  The many fabrications and outright frauds he puts forth are effectively debunked in the far superior video 'Breaking Da Vinci's Code' where actual, reputable scholars dubunk his numerous errors.

The pseudopigraphical writings known as the Gnostic (so-called) Gospels have been known to history since the 2nd Century and did not come to light for the first time at Nag Hammadi, although this cache of writings from that Egyptian city did increase our understanding of Gnosticism.  But the fact remains that these writings come from the 2nd century while the New Testament writings are demonstrably from the 1st century and carry the weight of Apostolic Authority, something the Gnostic writings never had.  By far the majority of mainstream historical and theological scholarship still rests on the side of the New Testament as the legitimate historical writings of the Christian Church, despite the efforts of a minority of Gnostic advocates, like Elaine Pagels.

It should also be clearly understood that the claims put forth in 'Holy Blood, Holy Grail' and 'The Da Vinci Code' are entirely rejected by mainstream scholarship, both liberal and conservative.  This is primarily because both books suffer from the same fatal flaw, that is the so-called 'Priory of Sion' and the 'Dossier Secret' claims advanced by these authors are known and establshed FRAUDS.  These are the fabrications of a circle of anti-semitic French nationalists (and certifiable nut-cases) who revolve around the figure of Pierre Plantard - who was a primary source in 'Holy Blood, Holy Grail' (as readers of that book should be aware).  This is established by the excellent video 'Breaking Da Vinci's Code' as well as CBS's 60 Minutes, which did an investigative report into Mr. Brown's 'facts' and came to the same conclusions as above (this was aired most recently on April 30th).  Many other researchers have done reviews of the 'facts' of HBHG and DVC and come to the same conclusions.

As a former Bible Seminary student and historical researcher, I can attest from my own research on these matters that the Da Vinci code is entirely a work of fiction and shouldn't be understood in any other light.  As far as 'Holy Blood, Holy Grail' is concerned, even it's own authors admit to it's highly speculative nature, not the type of writing one is going to draw serious historical or theological conclusions from.

The bottom line, don't be taken in by the light-weight, air-thin 'research' as presented in 'Da Vinci Decoded' or the two books that inspired this current mania into the long debunked Gnostic writings.  By far the great weight of history and scholarship rest on the New Testament as the legitimate and authentic history of Christianity.",1146960000,22,2969,5.0718685831622174
8035259,1,B0002ZDVFY,"Dan Brown is so full of bunk that his breath smells bad! This is a compilation of much of the same garbage that he included in his book. He tries, not very convincingly to prove his points. Someone reading his garbage that does not have a strong Bible based upbringing would be confused by Brown's fiction. I would recommend any other DVD, preferably something more uplifting.",1140825600,13,376,4.712121212121212
8035260,5,B0002ZDVFY,"The documentary delivers what should be expected, which is a lot of interview time with the people who wrote the books that Brown built his story around.  It's well done, and the interviews put good perspective on the content of those books in the context of what Brown used for some good storytelling.  But what makes it really interesting are the provocative questions that are raised, and the answers that are presented in turn.

You'll notice that the high ratings for most of the reviews here reflect the fact that this documentary was well done, and well worth watching.

If you do want to see this and want to view it with others in the same room, be advised that people who are tightly wrapped in dogma and blind faith in gospel are most likely to 1) React to this documentary in the same way that my dog responds to a math problem, or 2) Be highly offended.  Either reaction involves the same level of intelligence, but a highly offended Christian generally provides more entertainment value.",1139356800,10,1001,4.6647727272727275

I tried to keep them interested and have the DVD help explain some of the underlying theories that I found so interesting in Dan Brown's book, but the ""expert"" interviews were sloppy and not engaging.  When I switched to the extras, hoping to get some visuals on the sites mentioned in the book, the glimpses of Westminster Abbey and The Louvre were very brief while the Rosslyn Church segment made me nauseous with all the spinning camera work.  I wish they would have held still a little bit and let us LOOK at the place!
