8169646,3,B000MKXEXS,"The sound quality is not there but the workout is really there. It is almost too hard for me. I was sweating like crazy. When she says it is a intermediate  video, believe it.  Great workout",1483920000,,190,4.25
8169647,4,B000MKXEXS,"I love this routine!  Eva is an excellent instructor and the routine she puts together is interesting, fun and most importantly, the instructions given are sound.  My one and only issue is the sound quality.  If not for that, I'd give it 5 stars.",1288051200,,246,4.545454545454546
8169648,5,B000MKXEXS,"I love this dvd, is hard, it has lots of twist, standing poses, like worrior, triangle etc., lots of down dogs, the standing poses fill almost half an hour of the dvd. This is a good dvd to sweat, loose weight, detox, strenght, and feel so good after doing it. If you like standing poses like me, and an energetic class, with a exellent teacher,this dvd is for you.",1258761600,2,365,4.304347826086956
8169649,4,B000MKXEXS,"The fact Eva the does it in the living room is great, she's sweet, like working out with a joyous, very energetic girlfriend. She's very encouraging, she gives both the Sanskrit & English pose names, she tells you how to move your body well, she uses great analogies such as, ""Like your left ribs are chasing your right"" for one of the twisted poses to help keep your torso facing fwd. She has good body awareness & has a very long, detailed instruction on several poses in the library. Because of that, I think this is fine for beginner yoga practitioners or even novices.

Library: Eva Barash w/a male & female students to show how to properly do mountain, downward facing dog, learning a vinyasa (plank, chataranga, upward facing dog), full wheel, why we do relaxation. 30 min.

Savasana for 2 min w/her quiet, knees to chest, sit back up.

Cons:
Though the camera angles are great as well as the lighting, when she bends fwd her voice is muffled to the point it's hard to hear or can't understand her at all. Just like her Strength & Lengthen dvd, she is a bit jittery when she speaks, but very calm when she doesn't have to. Because she is probably nervous, it isn't as calming as yoga should be. I think it would have been perfect if she did a voice over after so she can be aware of her body during filming & relaxed voice separately.
Those looking to work out with a knowledgeable, very upbeat, energetic girlfriend style instructor will love this. Those looking for a more relaxed narration who need that for body awareness should look to Rodney Yee, Rainbeau Mars, Seane Corn, Better Sex w/yoga (upbeat, but still relaxing), Yoga w/Ateeka, Elena Brower, Wai Lana (more Qi Gong which stimulates meridians), Kristen Strohecker, Kristen McGee & Kabbalah Yoga (has no instruction).",1237939200,8,3037,4.949019607843137
8169650,3,B000MKXEXS,"I bought this DVD on a recommendation from a fitness magazine.  I was really looking forward to it, but was disappointed with the sound quality.  Everytime the instructor put her head down, what she was saying was muffled, like she was speaking out of the bottom of a barrel.  I was also very confused by her reference to ""Monday's"" class, since there is only one class on the DVD.  The instruction, what you could hear of it was good, but I would not recommend it based upon the poor sound quality.",1208908800,4,499,4.450549450549451
8169651,5,B000MKXEXS,"I was very happy with the first DVD in the series, Strengthen and Lengthen, and I'm really happy with this one for all the same reasons. I love Eva's approach. She's just so accessible and down-to-earth. And when she says stuff like, ""Don't you feel taller here?"" or ""Don't you feel different?"" I ALWAYS do. I definitely recommend this series.",1203897600,,343,4.733333333333333
8169652,5,B000MKXEXS,This DVD is a must have for the busy yoga enthusiast.  Eva Barash is a fantastic instructor.  She makes you so comfortable with her calm narration that you actually feel like she's really in your living room.  Don't let the title fool you.  This is a great yoga workout.  All this in the comfort of your home.  I loved it and highly recommend.,1201478400,2,343,4.365079365079365
8169653,5,B000MKXEXS,"Great yoga DVD! Eva's positive energy shines through the entire class! She has a great ""yoga voice"" that inspires and enlivens. Good verbal and visual instructions, all in all a fabulous yoga class in my very own living room. Highly recomended!",1200873600,2,244,4.975609756097561
8169654,5,B000MKXEXS,"Eva has done it again! This dvd is just great! She continues with her unique style and great personality, while delivering an excellent yoga practice. I highly recommend both of the dvd's in the Livingroom Yoga series!",1200614400,2,218,4.918918918918919
