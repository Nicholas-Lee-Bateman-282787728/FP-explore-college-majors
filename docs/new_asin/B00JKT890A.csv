6373501,4,B00JKT890A,"I got my copy as it got released.
Packaging was ok. Nothing special.
4 star for the physical part .
But 5 star for the anime.

I really love this anime when it came out in Japanese via Funimation..., I laughed so many times, the characters are likable and the chemistry between Emilia and Mao Sama was just awesome. The McRonald parody and all was pretty good. From a Demon KIng to McRonal employee was just too funny. Overall, the comedic writting was pretty good in Japanese.

 And so I was curious how the ADR version would come out and or translate . So what I did was not to watch the Japanese version but directly go to the english version and I am happy that I find it as funny as I remembered it to be.

Although  I would prefer Emy to have a much lower voice because her and Chie voice talent has similar voice quality , so they both sound high pitchy at the same time, which is very annoying to listen in the long run . She sound more like a teenager and than  an adult. Thats my only gripe in the 4 start area.

But  I was laughing at the gibbirish russian/italian/german  for their former language .

 Well I don't know what demon language is ...latin? LOL",1406678400,,1168,4.216216216216216
6373502,5,B00JKT890A,"The demon king and his minion escape a war in their world to modern day Japan, only to find their primary archenemy has followed. Only the archenemy finds it difficult to blatantly attack someone who, now as a human, has a personal goal of world domination, once ""MgRonalds"" makes him a fulltime employee. The short series is full of likeable characters, good writing, and a plot amusing to anyone trapped in a dead-end part time or low paying job.

This release includes both a Blu-Ray and DVD copy of the series, both English and Japanese versions, as well as a small sampling of extras. Funimation has also released a BR/DVD combo pack, but it seems harder to find, but this does include both. It's why the box is so thick.",1406419200,,726,4.584615384615384
6373503,5,B00JKT890A,"Love it, I have the subbed and dubbed version watched them both several times. It is a funny show. Get it.",1406160000,,106,4.095238095238095
6373504,5,B00JKT890A,Had a lot of fun watching this despite it only being 13 episodes I was not bored at all and will definitely be re watching it,1405641600,2,125,3.8461538461538463
6373505,5,B00JKT890A,"My husband and I really enjoyed this series. It's very fun, but not in a ridiculous or childish way that some anime can be. My only negative would be that this set is very expensive for how many episodes it had. Maybe I am missing something since it's still in pre-order mode.",1402444800,9,276,4.326923076923077
6373506,5,B00JKT890A,"I found this series thoroughly enjoyable, and have already rewatched it several times, and plan to share it with my wife when I can get an English dub* (anime is already a reach for her, I don't want subtitles to make it even harder for her to enjoy). I am fairly new to anime, so perhaps the genre mishmash is not as bothersome to me. I guess many wine experts find rose to be a vulgar blend of red and white wines, but there are lots of people who enjoy drinking it nevertheless. So I wouldn't let this series' genre-bending stand in your way of checking it out.

I will grant there has to be a fair amount of suspension of disbelief, especially in the degree to which Maou becomes such an ethical and law-abiding member of society. But in fact, that is the source of so much of the ironic and subtle humor. Many conversations between characters take place at crosswalks while waiting for the light to change - Maou won't even jaywalk! - but this little touch is easily missed on the first viewing.

I've also read anime fans' comments about the magic system - don't get too wrapped up in it. The action parts are interesting, and give us some plot tension, but ultimately they are secondary. Suffice to say that Maou (or somebody) will get just enough magic when he needs it, but it will be all used up when the battle is over, so he can't return to Ente Isla.

The subtle and cultural humor is the source of the real gems in this series. Ashiya's frugality with the household budget turns up in a number of unexpected times and places; Chiho-chan's crush on Maou is so pure and innocent (the ""bento box from another girl"" bit is so awesome it spans two episodes), and yet she also knows a thing or two about flaunting her assets in a bikini.

The most difficult character is Emi, who must reconcile the evil Ente Isla Maou, whose army slaughtered her village, with the law-abiding Earth/Japan/Tokyo/Sasazuka Maou. Over time she realizes that her identity in Ente Isla was defined completely by her opposition to the evil Maou - now that he doesn't seem so bad, what's she supposed to do with herself?

Overall: a good mix of humor, action, and characters, very fun to watch.

(*Note: this review is of the series watched with English subtitles - the product listed is purportedly dubbed in English.)",1401321600,25,2303,4.510791366906475
6373507,5,B00JKT890A,"The Maou (Demon King) Satan is well on his way to world domination when he is predictably thwarted by a valiant hero. He makes a hasty retreat to another world - modern day Tokyo. What is a demon king to do in a world without magic? Flip burgers of course.

Ah how the mighty are brought low. Without his magic, Maou becomes a hard working, honest, and generally good guy. Of course, it is possible he was a nice guy before and only wanted to conquer Ente Isla for the peoples own good, but that side of him is never really explored, so it is hard to tell (too bad, it would have been interesting). But as the dedicated part timer, he strives hard so that he and his friend are able to eat and pay rent. He continues to claim that his plan is to work to the top and take over Japan, but as other characters point out, that is very unlikely to happen, even with his elongated life span.

Most of the story is slice of life and the rest magical battles. The story takes place almost exclusively on Earth, but naturally characters from Ente Isla make there way towards Maou for various reasons. There isn't a whole lot of overall plot, but the story does move along as Satan advances through the ranks of McRonalds and makes new friends.

I thoroughly enjoyed the humor of the series and Maou's dedicated work ethic. I liked most of the characters and surprisingly the magic system as well (not very complicated, but something different from normal). I watched it with a group of friends and we all enjoyed it. We watched it streaming on Funimation, but I am planning to buy the series on DVD.",1401148800,65,1590,4.364864864864865

6373510,3,B00JKT890A,"Unfortunately it's missing scenes from the original anime, not a HUGE deal as they're not big to the story line, just little losses of some fun background and side stuff which was a little disappointing considering it's not some cheap bootleg. There was also a point where the picture bounced and fluctuated but I haven't had the chance to double check and make sure it wasn't just the television.",1497657600,,397,4.768115942028985

6373513,5,B00JKT890A,A fun premise and well executed. Some parts were fairly easy to figure out but there were enough surprises to keep it interesting. I really enjoyed the plot and how it developed.

6373516,1,B00JKT890A,"Paid 70+ dollars for this, but to keep the cases within the chipboard box from falling out, someone put tape around it, which seems good in theory, but it was incredibly hard to get off, and when I did finally get it off, it actually ripped off bits of the box on the front of it. Not to mention there's also stickers on the bottom left of the back of it that I imagine will also rip off the covering of the box, so I won't bother touching it. I probably won't see any compensation for a product I paid so much for that they ruined, but oh well. Thanks for nothing.",1489363200,,565,4.053571428571429

6373518,4,B00JKT890A,"**No Spoilers**

The Devil is a Part-timer is one of those Anime's that makes up its own rules and runs with it forgoing a detailed explanation. In this case, that is a good thing. The story is set up like a sit-com with its moments of seriousness. Also, there is not really any Fan Service in this so depending on your preference, that can be good or bad. The only real down side is the series feels too short and you are left wanting more and knowing more. As of writing this review I am unaware of any Season 2 prospects.

Overall, if you want a short, humorous story of  good versus evil, this is for you.",1488931200,3,609,4.188034188034188
6373519,5,B00JKT890A,This is still a great show.  I can't stop watching it.  Maoh is such a likeable character and it works for him.  He gets to experience humanity and I think it suits him well.,1488153600,,174,4.0588235294117645
6373520,5,B00JKT890A,"- Synopsis: The story takes us to the end of a long and bloody war. Slowly, the human side is gaining momentum as they stomp out all opposition from the demon side one by one. Until finally, they reach the final boss. It was a hard-fought battle, but the demons were slightly outmatched and were forced to escape. When they regained their composure, they found they were in a different world: Japan. After some trial-and-error, they decided to establish their base of operations and learn of their new world. However, one of the heroes also managed to traverse to Japan. Tune in to find out how this unique group of demons and humans come together in a not-so-common story.
===========================================================================================================

- Comments: An excellent comedy that is relatable and refreshing with their unique presentation of demons and humans. They managed to change an otherwise serious and dramatic plot, to a silly one that will typically have the viewer laughing and smiling. Though of course, there still has to be some seriousness which is overshadowed as the anime progresses. This anime is great for anybody looking for some comedy; Whether you are a viewer with dry-humor or not.

- Analysis: The story of a hero and demon king isn't anything new. That is, until this anime decided to relegate their top-notch status to those that are working at minimum wage. So, instead of the usual commanding of armies and preparing for war, they do so in a different way as they are the ones following orders. How the mighty have fallen. A much appreciated detail that shows the complexities and duties of grunt-work.

This anime has a heavy emphasis on socialization, among other things. This may infer to the fact that life revolves around relationships and that many things cannot be done alone, as many people within a social circle can contribute or accommodate for one's strengths and weaknesses. Or the simple reason that having friends just makes life more tolerable and interesting.

One of the other concepts that is addressed in this anime, is that many people want to find meaning in their lives. For many, this may be simply living paycheck-to-paycheck. Others may have more trouble as they ponder their existence and role within society. In this case, the cast is relatively content simply living out their daily lives and experiencing the joys of learning new experiences. This adds much relevance to the reality that many of  us perceive.

- Features: English and Japanese audio with English subtitles. Contains 13 episodes on 2 Blu-rays, and 13 on 2 DVDs for a total of 4 discs. Approximate run-time of 5 hours and is rated TV-14 for fantasy violence, blood, and some fan-service.

- Conclusion: A refreshing adventure about Satan working at MgRonald's and a hero that works in a call center. Loaded with exposition, drama, silliness, relevance, satire, slight fan-service, and more, this anime will have you laughing for days while also invoking a warm-feeling inside due to the likable cast, and the whacky situations. If you are a viewer that enjoys comedy, this is a must-watch for anime fans.

6373534,5,B00JKT890A,"As a longtime Anime watcher, I love this series! Both the English and Japanese dubs are excellent, even though this comedy series is the type that normally would pass completely under the radar. As someone tired of the typical High School formula, the fact that the main characters here are young adults (demons/half-angels) struggling to live in the human world with actual jobs instead of relying so much on suspension of disbelief and a more gothic-style that would give them megabucks and keep them focused on the typical ""kill the demon king"" plot really speaks to me now that I have been out of High School for years now, and am seeking something that's closer to my new-adult sensibilities. If you love Devil is a Part Timer and are looking for something similar, I would also suggest checking out Yu-Sibu - though I think it's telling that even though Yu-Sibu is older (in terms of its anime adaptation which is what got me into either series to begin with), I actually opened up the old wallet and purchased Devil Is a Part Timer first ;p

Devil Is a Part Timer also has a Light Novel (and a fairly well written and translated one at that) that goes far beyond the anime, as well as a number of manga adaptations (one of which sets our heroes and villains in a High School for those curious of how it would have turned out with the typical formula), so this is definitely a series that is capable of providing plenty of entertainment in a fresh, familiar, yet very different world!",1473292800,4,1490,4.580524344569288

It's not a huge climactic ending, but it fits the series, and it gives the feeling things will turn out the way you want them to. It's pretty entertaining to see the demon king go to such lengths to fit in and be a law abiding, productive member of society (on a budget). It's a much better series than I was expecting, I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who likes anime. (possible spoiler?) And it's *not* a harem anime.

6373557,4,B00JKT890A,"The Devil is a Part-Timer! is a Japanese fantasy, comedy anime series released in 2013, based on the light novels written by Satoshi Wagahara.  After being defeated by the hero Emilia Justina, The Dark Lord Satan and his General Alciel flee to the Earth dimension and land in Japan.  There, with their magic slowly depleting, they are forced to assume lives of normal human beings in order to survive.

Rather than review this, since reviews are entirely subjective, I've decided to try something new.  Below, you will find simple points that will help you determine whether to watch this series or not.

Fun Factor
Silly.

Harem Factor
Minor.  Three (possibly four) girls are seeking the affection of one guy, with one of them in denial.  However, only one of them is obsessive about it.

Sex Factor
None.

Nudity Factor
None.  However, some cleavage is emphasized.

Oddity Factor
High.  The first episode starts in the other dimension, where no one is speaking a real language.  Certain characters continue this trend throughout the series, leaving the viewer confused.

Gore Factor
None.

Language Factor
Minor. There is a running commentary on the breast size of two characters.

Violence Factor
Minor.  The series is mostly based on the comedic drama between the main characters with spurts of occasional violence.

Verdict
Excellent.  The Devil is a Part-Timer! is a very funny and engaging anime filled with interesting characters, silly situations, and a satisfying soundtrack.  Sadly, it only has one season.",1447545600,,1517,5.110204081632653

6373562,5,B00JKT890A,"The Devil is a Part-Timer Season 1 is a 13 episode anime that my husband introduced me to and is definitely not what it at first appears to be with the title (with obviously favorable results). The dvd centers around the characters of Sadao Mao, Shiro Ashiya, Chiho,and Emilia Justinia who came from the world of Ente Isla and end up in modern day Japan for various reasons. They end up having to help each other as one of the characters works at MgRonalds while dealing with a rival busness across the street (Sentucky Fried chicken). Additionally, the characters of Sadao Mao and Shiro Ashiya improve for the better which confuses Emilia Justinia even more due to one of the reasons that brought her to Japan in the first place. There is obviously more to the series than what Im writing, yet  something compels me to avoid revealing more for those who have yet to see this distinctive anime series.",1441843200,,901,4.63125
6373563,5,B00JKT890A,"The best anime series I have watched with the kids.  A little content inappropriate for the youngest kids, and some mild fan service.

6373565,5,B00JKT890A,"Let's be honest here. I bought this series in a flash sale for 40-50% off or something, and I have never regretted it. This is one of my favorite anime series of all time because it's not too long for my short attention span, but it also feels like you're not missing out on anything when it ends. The characters are hilarious and vibrant, so if you're feeling like crap, I recommend you watch this series. 10/10, would do everything all over again.",1440547200,,449,4.421686746987952
6373566,5,B00JKT890A,"An extremely fun show with a wonderfully well done dub, this show really grew on me until now I'm completely in love with it. The show doesn't take itself too seriously, usually throwing the audience for a loop with clever one-liners that take the attention away from the fairly cliche storyline. However what really caught my attention was the dub for this show. The Devil and the Hero Emilia are really well done and they really made the show for me. I always felt like the story could have taken a more serious tone and they started out like that at the beginning. But it slowly gets more light-hearted along the way, even if the seriousness of the main story keeps popping up to keep it moving along. Overall I'd highly recommend this show if you're looking for a funny semi-action anime that will definitely keep your attention.",1438905600,,833,4.635135135135135
6373567,5,B00JKT890A,"I can't even count the number of times I have watched this anime. The story is refreshing and will at least have you grinning throughout the entire show.

The main character, Maou, is the demon king of another world known as Ente Isla. He was well on his way to complete world domination before a near-assassination by the hero, Emilia. Close to defeated, he and his right-hand general Alciel escape to modern-day Tokyo through a magical gate.

And that...is the beginning. It's a must-watch! You'll smirk and shake your head along with these quirky and well-developed characters.",1438732800,,580,4.969072164948454

Overall its great, the only issue that is slightly distressing is the cardboard case around the bluray case is pretty big, so it slids out pretty easily. Since I move around alot, it is slightly disconcerting to me, but some may have no issues with this. I'd recommend this because it also has DVD for those without bluray but want it one day. The show of course is one of my favorite anime of all time and so regadrless, its will be money well spent! My only complaint for the show is that its only one season... oh well, I can still pray and hope for a second season haha.",1437955200,,729,4.2898550724637685

Sadao gets a job as a part-time fast food worker at MgRonalds.

After reading the description of the show I was a bit more skeptical, it read like the typical clich&eacute; type of show but I decided that if that many people liked it enough that they would wear an outfit based on fast food service I had to check it out. This show was much more than I expected. Rather than being able to come from another world to earth and magically being able to speak the local language they actually had to learn to be part of the society. The characters have quite a bit of depth and thought out. The animation quality is excellent. They really put in lots of tiny little details which make this show great.

6373611,5,B00JKT890A,"Their are some similar recent anime series that have a good deal of similar humor, but the plot usually boils down to something more serious.  The Index series for instance, or the currently playing Maria the Virgin Witch.  It's priceless to watch the hero, (a girl) who has followed the devil and his devoted follower to this dimension, try to spy on them.  She manages to overhear just enough to think they are hatching some evil plots, which turn out to be, either going to the bathhouse, or standing in line at the grocery to get a bargain price on eggs.

I'm sometimes stuck about the Japanese overall view of the Christian religions as often times they become the heavy as with this kind of anime.  That plotline is easy enough to forget here, but as I said demands more attention in other recent anime, Spice and Wolf comes to mind.  Here it just works enough to drive the humor without the heavy hand in those other series.

Other parts of the humor expose some of the lacking in our own children and the mundane menial work they often distain.  The Devil shows that diligence and proper dedication will typically result in moving up the ranks quickly and not becoming mired in the low end of the business.  It is a subtle lesson, and it should maybe be taken to heart by some of the target audience of this series.  Sustained humor in anime is hard to do, I've known some series that bored me long before they reached the halfway point.  This one does it well, but would probably not be sustainable to have sequels.  Hayete the Combat Butler, only existed as long as it did because it used parody of a number of other anime series to create and sustain that humor.  Fairly original humor is hard to find, but there is some of that here, and more than enough to enjoy.",1425427200,,1776,4.444444444444445

6373628,5,B00JKT890A,"I absolutely loved this show.  I watched it because of GR's review, though Arkada's view of it didn't really excite me.  It just seemed an interesting concept:  a slice-of-life
show not about high school-age kids (which put it on the level of ""Honey and Clover""), with the twist of all the characters (except Chi) being supernatural beings from another reality.

For once, the protagonist is not a hapless, nervous, inexperienced adolescent, but a being that had been on the verge of conquering an entire world.  What a pleasure to have a lead that isn't constantly blushing, falling down, and apologizing, but instead is confident but not arrogant.  Arkada -- and The Hero (Emi), in-universe -- both wondered why a being intent on conquering his world by iron and fire would suddenly become considerate and helpful in our world.  I don't know why either, but it's a wonderful thematic ju-jitsu, leaving everyone from the ""good"" side of Ente Isla (translated by Google as ""Entity Island) striving to defeat Sadao, while on his part he seems to be far more interested in being a success in his job at MgRonald's.  It's never explained, and it never may be explained, but it's a great source of humor.

I haven't yet listened to the Japanese dub yet, but the English dub is great.  Nice to see such voice talent without any of the usual suspects in sight, and the ""topical"" humor is still old enough that everyone has heard it.  When Sadao mentioned in the ""Seven Wonders"" episode that the Internet was like ""a series of magical tubes,"" I chuckled, and when Ashiya, overhearing Emi and Suzuno discussing Sadao in the ""Sentucky Fried Chicken"" restaurant, interrupts them with ""I WOULD NOT SAY SUCH THINGS IF I WERE YOU!!!"" -- straight from ""The Princess Bride"" -- I almost fell off the couch.

I just bought my copy in HD video from Amazon. Perhaps a second season will be made.  I haven't read the manga yet, so I don't know where the anime ended up, but I'll follow up with that ASAP.  This show is definitely worth buying, though, as Arkada suggested.  It's a pleasant modification of a classic type of anime, so there's that at least.",1421971200,2,2135,4.716981132075472

Minus 1 star for lack of humor.
Minus 1 star for lack of action.

Plus 1 star for animation quality.
Plus 1 star for potential.

I must admit that if it were a S.A.V.E. for about fifteen bucks I would consider buying it just to see if it gets any better.

6373636,2,B00JKT890A,"(Please note I watched dubbed version only)

Put simply ""The Devil Is a Part Timer"" is boring. The plot is jerky and new elements of the story aren't introduced in a way that flows smoothly. Characters lack any unique qualities that would make them interesting or memorable. The voice acting, soundtrack, and animation are average. In the end there just isn't an element that pulls you into the show. There was potential here, but at $28.49 for 12 episodes ""The Devils Is a Part Timer"" is not worth it. If your in between good anime and just looking for a filler show you should still wait until this anime is $15 or less.

6373648,4,B00JKT890A,"Pros:
1. Eng VAs really put their hearts into this one. The Jap VAs were almost lackluster especially on the female front as there was no appreciable difference between Emilia the Hero in Japanese to any other random girl happily living a peaceful life in Japan where fun things happen to cute gir...zzz.... English Emilia on the other hand was by no means great by you can glimpse the battle born PTSD that anyone and certainly a child would have developed when thrust into battle against literally Satan himself.
2. Fun story and good pacing. At only 13 episodes long this show could not afford to waste entire episodes on frivolity and does not make this mistake. Typical contrived situations such as the swimsuit episode still served to advance the story while adding in humor and fan service.

Cons:
1. 13 episodes for such a potentially rich story leaves the viewer wondering but there are always the LNs to go for if you can't wait.
2. Emilia is shown to have a miserable childhood and a war torn coming of age all courtesy of Satan but she does not often display this in ways easily distinguishable from generic tsun behavior.

Thoughts:
The original creator of the LNs clearly must have either done a stint at McDick's or had informative friends who worked in one. The dissonance between the idyllic and poverty stricken life that Satan lives VS the intrigue laden albeit luxurious nature of politics in the land he came from make for fun and the sense that the imagination of the human mind can sometimes break the chains of a mundane life.
Also, Alciel's VA was clearly devoted to his role and whatever Funimation paid was not enough considering the results.",1415836800,3,1669,4.712328767123288

6373654,5,B00JKT890A,"The Devil is a Part Timer is a very funny series that combines fantasy, action and slice-of-life humor. The premise is that the devil and his servant have been chased out of their magical land of Ente Isla and end up on Earth. Here, their magic powers are very limited, so they have to find part time jobs to make a living until they can return to Ente Isla and take it over again. But the devil finds that humans are, all in all, pretty easy to get along with, and his plans for domination get sidetracked by his desire to move up the management chain of the fast food restaurant where he works, much to the surprise of both his servant and of Ente Isla's hero, who has followed the devil to Earth to keep an eye on him.

I've watched the series both in Japanese with English subtitles and with an English overdub and I have to say the dubbing is very good. There were only a couple of times through the whole series where the dubs were bad enough to be distracting. Given that this is a show whose main character is Satan, it's also a surprisingly family-friendly series. There's some light blood in the action scenes and a couple of jokes about breast size (which has unfortunately become standard for anime), but overall it's PG-rated stuff. This show isn't about sex and violence, it's about watching characters adapt to new situations and how their relationships with each other change as they adapt. And it's very, very funny without being too over-the-top with its humor.

The audio and video of the blu-ray are excellent, and the first episode includes a commentary track by the directors of the English dub that's both engaging and informative. Highly recommended!",1413417600,6,1674,4.595317725752508

Furthermore, this limited edition set comes in a premium chipboard artbox that looks awesome!  I also thought that the dubbing was very good, and just as good as the original Japanese audio.

This is the first season consisting of a little over 20 episodes.  Not particularly work the cost, given the size.  More than Game of Thrones, and that's one of the most expensive shows to purchase.

Regarding the quality of show, please refer to other reviews.  I loved it, and highly recommend it.",1412553600,,456,4.782051282051282
6373660,5,B00JKT890A,"I have to say I love this anime. It takes two contrastive elements and slams them together, and does it well. It takes the Demon King, Satan, a being of lore and otherworldly history we associate with as evil; dark; dangerous, and mixes him with humor, friendship, and living an average, human life as a hardworking ""McRonalds"" employee. Taking the name Sadao Maou in present day Japan, he and his servant Alsiel flee Ente Isla as his army/ies were falling to the Hero, Emilia.

At first, I watched in curiosity, wondering how the formula could work. And I fell in love with it. Yeah, like with most every anime, it has teenage girl bouncing boob fan service, but that's where my irritation ended (partly because the show did it seriously, maybe, twice, and the rest of the time they were mocking the fan derive, acknowledging their own ridiculousness). I cannot really say it enough, it's just a really hilarious show, and, I have to say, it has heart and just doesn't take itself seriously; considering the content of the show, and the lives and background these characters are from, any other anime/story, I don't think, could pull off the humor as convincingly as The Devil is a Part Timer did for me.

I won't go into any more spoilers other than what the basic summary/information box tells you, but this is a show I would buy. I have yet been unable to do so, but it is on my list to do just that. I do hate paying $40 for 13 episodes, but it could be a heck of a lot more (and in many cases, is). I look forward to adding it to my collection. If you're on the fence, it is streaming. I understand that money is money and dropping almost $50 on a product you have no idea about is a stretch.

I give this 5 stars because The Devil is a Part Timer is a fun show with smart content. It doesn't take itself seriously, despite its serious content and ideas and themes it contains. Despite its light heartedness, the show presents its viewer with real struggle both in our present day world, whether it has to do with working a meager 9 to 5 job, to living on minimum wage, paying off appliances and registering your bike to the city. As well, it delves into deeper issues, and also gives its audience intelligent content about a parallel world up to its ears in corruption and war, the question of ""who are the real monsters"" incredibly prevalent. The English dub is great, every voice didn't seem out of place and fit the animation/character it was assigned to (Sometimes, you just get an anime that has a character whose voice makes your eye twitch a little. This did not happen in TDPT.). I won't go into who voices who, but, as usual Funimation brings its best voices and A-game. I can't give it enough praise and haven't much room for negative in this case. There is nothing I have to criticize in this case, and I hope there is a second season in the works.

Yen Press, I believe, has licensed the light novels to come out by next year, too. So that is another thing to be excited about, if you come to love this story and its characters as much as I do.",1412467200,,3063,4.387323943661972

The characters are well done, and their interactions are hilarious. The writing is good, not the best, but far from the worst. The original and English voice overs have their pros and cons. I preferred the original. The animation quality is good. As of this post the light novels have been recently picked up by Yen press, so if their are not future installments of the anime, hopefully the LNs will be successful enough so we can see what happens after the events of the anime.

6373671,5,B00JKT890A,"The Devil King Satan tried to take over the world of Esta Isla, but was thwarted by a hero and forced to run to another world with his right hand man.  Except the world they ended up in is our world, and while there is magic here, it is not easy to access so they cannot restore their magics and return to exact vengence.  So the King is a part timer at a fast food restaurant to make ends meet, and is actually fitting in - he has friends, the respect of the manager, and a very cute girl crushing on him (though he does not get a clue until explained to him later)- until the Hero from his old world appears to try to kill him.  Now how is this former evil lord going to be able to avoid being slain by a holy sowrd, all while trying to become shift manager, deal with rebellious minions, and confront the most dangerous evil known, a competing fast food chain trying to put them out of business.

Honestly, I enjoyed this series.  The characters were relatable (especially for those who did time in the fast food industry), the humor is enjoyable, and you get drawn to Satan and Ema - two opposites, but yet in the same boat.  And to see someone who once sat at the top of his race being able to put everything aside to show that he has a good work ethic and as he lives in our world, and shows that he actually cares for this world and those he has become close with (including a red haired Hero) is something not many people would expect.  Like others I wish they explained why he did what he did in the old world, I do think that there is more than meets the eye.  But there could always be another season.

This will be in my collection for a long time and i will enjoy it again after I catch up on a few other series I have on disk.  I strongly recommend this for all viewers.",1408579200,9,1784,4.071428571428571

Upon their arrival in japan they must face the fact that they are almost completely powerless and must adapt to this world. King satan's conquest to rule this world is a fun one with lots of funny moments of everyday life and other world oddities. I would completely recommend this show, ive watched it over a dozen times since receiving it and im still laughing. I also thought they did a really great job on the dub all the voices matched the characters very well.

6373679,5,B00JKT890A,"This show is charming. As a guy that went through college on a budget, the dilemma of trying to live on minimum wage was really funny to me. The biggest surprise was that it is not a ""fanservice"" show. It's NOT bait for Yaoi Fangirls, nor is it that softcore porn that you have to hide in your room. It's just a good show.

In another dimension, Angels and Demons fight for control of the country Ente Isla. After a big battle, two demons - Satan and Alciel, escape and land in modern day Japan without their powers. They have to wait for their magic to be restored, so they have to survive as humans, which means getting a job so they can eat. Its basically a slice of life anime, with fantasy elements.

Funimation did a great job adapting the series. They kept the off-brand names, MagRonalds and Sentucky. Plus we get two commentaries, on Episodes 01 and 13.

If I had to complain about something, it's the names. Clearly, the creators didn't know Satan and Lucifer are the same Devil. Also, Sadou (Satan) isn't THE Devil, he's A Devil. But that's just me being Catholic.

So pick it up if you like Slice of Life Anime, or is you've ever worked in Fast Food. I would love a second season. Five-out-of-Five.",1407888000,,1210,4.4125560538116595
6373680,5,B00JKT890A,"This series is definitely worth the 5 star rank! The humor in this series is the major draw in my opinion, and they definitely don't disappoint. I love how they put this story together, basically the Devil is forced out of his castle in Ente Isla and now has to figure out how to live on earth. He (the Devil) and his loyal servant Alciel wind up in so many ridiculous situations, such as the new job that they realize they need in order to support themselves! The humor in this is portrayed on so many different levels that it is easy to miss some of the more hilarious bits if you aren't paying attention, and I like that because everything isn't right on the surface. If I had any complaints about this, it would be that they leave you set up for another season, however I think that the stopping point that was chosen was appropriate. If you enjoy comedy, great art, a good score and decent plot then this is for you! There are slight moments of fan service, but nothing over the top and there is no nudity.

Basic story - the Devil leads a war of demons against humans and finally has to run away to Earth.  He ends up in Tokyo, with no money, no power, and needing a source of both - so he gets a job flipping burgers.  From there, you can imagine what he goes through next as he adapts to life among the humans and we find out that he's not the evil person that every one believes.  He is helped by his General - also weak - who cannot seem to find a job and so ends up playing house ""wife"" to his leader.  A troubling issue arrives in the form of the ""Hero"" which had driven him out of their original dimension, and then discovers the difficultly of matching the known Devil with what is subsequently observed.

8651921,5,B00JKT890A,"On Ente Isle the demons have decided to take over. Satan's armies led by four demon generals are about to take control when a hero throws back Satan's forces. Satan and General Alciel are forced to flee to another world. Where do they end up? Modern Tokyo of course. They find out that their magic doesn't work so our demonic twosome have to find a place to live, get ID cards and earn some cash. What does King Satan do to earn a living? Work at a fast food joint whilst plotting a way to go home. Their idyllic life is distrubed when they find that they've been followed by the hero who plans to stop their plans.
This is the story of how heroes and demons cope with modern living. Their are two story arcs which are similar in extent. In my opinion the first story arc is better, better paced and with a more satisfying ending. That's not to say that the last six episodes are bad; they aren't but the first story arc is more interesting.
This series has a sly and sarcastic sense oh humour running all the way through it. I enjoyed this aspect but some may not. The script is generally good and the characters are well balanced and plausible given the concept.
The animation on the DVD and blu-ray is good. Now here's the bad part. And it's really bad. I first watched this as a stream and then watched the blu-ray and DVD versions. As a stream in Japanese the the sound quality was great. This si not the case on either disc format. The Japanese sound track is okay, not great but okay. The English soundtrack is truly awful. The voice acting is actually reasonable but the sound quality is appalling. The voice actors sound as if they had socks stuffed in their mouths and then were recorded through a wall. This is unacceptably bad sound editing and if you only listened to the English soundtrack thisd would be a real disappointment. I'd say go with the Japanese version with somewhat quirky translations.
This reminded me a little bit of ""I couldn't be a hero so I reluctantly decided to get a job (Yu SIbu). There's no fan service in Devil is a Part Timer and it's not missed at all. It's better than Yu Sibu, more consistent and much funnier. I liked the streamed version so much I bought the discs and apart from the English soundtrack this is highly recommeded if you like sly humour with good action and characters.",1522368000,,2329,4.406032482598608
