1879251,5,B000095J2Y,"What a classic! Like many cult classics such as Evil Dead, this movie was made with a low budget, and like many cult classics wins due to being just damn cool!
A simple story, 2 just escaped prisoners arrange to meet some dodgy gang characters to make their getaway, at the edge of a large forest. Unknown to our cast the forest contains a portal to many other times, and is a bit dangerous. The meeting goes foul and the gang members chase the escapees into the forest. The gang has previously killed and buried many former victims in this forest, but to their misfortune the portal awakens them into an onslaught of Zombies.
A magnificent blend of martial arts and gunplay, not forgetting the traditional Samurai swordplay, gives an altogether fast paced action blood fest. This film is not for the feint-hearted, but is great fun for the slasher fan!
Having already achieved worldwide cult status, a US dvd release will only help in creating an even larger fan base.
The acting is not excellent, the special effects are not the greatest, the plotline is thin, it has moments of cheese, it lacks Hollywood refinement and won't win an Oscar. For fans of this genre it will excite and bring a bit of fun onto your TV screen.
I have only seen the uncut version, therefore I cannot comment on the R-rated version which will be released.
If you are unsure, then this film is probably not for you. But don't take my word for it, search the web for other reviews of this Japanese Cult Classic and make up your own mind!",1055548800,19,1514,4.529197080291971
1879253,4,B000095J2Y,"Do you remember when Lucas re-released the original Star Wars movies with all that silly extra stuff?  This version is kinda like that, but not quite as bad.  The new footage was actually filmed a few years after the movie was finished, then edited into the original footage.  As a fan, I think the new scenes were fun to watch, but were overkill.  The film was already perfectly over the top as it was.  All the extended scenes diminish the pace of the film making it kinda boring...too much of anything is usually a bad thing.  There are also new music tracks which I found to be distracting.  The music wasn't bad, but I've watched this movie many times and am so used to the original music tracks.  I prefer to watch the director's cut or special edition, but this Ultimate edition has a lot of extra interviews and behind the scenes footage (some good and some not so good) on 3 discs in a nice sturdy case.  If this also contained the original version of the film, I'd give it 5 stars, but it only contains the 'George' version.  I would recommend this to fans who have already seen the film and own a previously released version.  I would not recommend this version to anyone who hasn't seen the movie yet, or is replacing a lost or damaged dvd of an earlier version.  If I could only own 1 version, I'd choose the 2-disc Special Edition.",1420675200,3,1345,4.40080971659919

The performances are all over the top, but it fits into the movie. The characters are all quirky and just weird. Their are also moments off oddly placed humor, but again, it works.

The special effects are noticeably low budget, at one point you can see a tube squirting fake blood under a characters sleeve.

I recommend this to anyone who likes over the top action movies, or supernatural stories.",1419206400,,603,4.513761467889908

1879257,5,B000095J2Y,"I was introduced to this film thanks to Diamanda Hagan's review of it. So inspired, I immediately went to Amazon and snatched up a very well priced copy and I have no regrets about this spontaneous purchase.

This is a silly, idiotically majestic film and it is hard not to be swept up with it, as everyone here is obviously having a grand time in a world where you only need to reload your gun when you can look cool why doing it. But no one, absolutely no one, has more fun than green shirt guy. This man chews every piece of scenery in the best of ways and is so spastic that I feared he might strain something. He and long-haired guy with glasses are an excellent pair in opposites and I would have loved to have a movie just about them doing crime and killing people in a black comedy of sorts.

Also, zombies.",1405987200,2,815,4.217948717948718

Blood, bullets, bullets, gore, more blood, samurai, and one woman, plus more gunfire.
I half expected to see a Chow-yun Fat zombie.

I will keep it short here. I own the blu-ray and dvd and I am partial to the DVD.
The English 5.1 dub track on the DVD is IMO superior to the blue-ray.

Now I know what some of you purists are thinking that one should never listen to the DUB but then
this is a special case horror flick IMO. I found with so much going on in the movie it was just easier
to listen to the English dub plus it rocks on a surround system.

The video is just as great in both formats.

1879273,5,B000095J2Y,"Versus (VERSUS -- Vsasu?) is a 2000 Japanese independent zombie action film co-written, produced, and directed by Ryuhei Kitamura. Originally intended as a sequel to Kitamura's Down To Hell, the script surpassed expectations and ultimately evolved into a different film. Though the film was not released theatrically worldwide (except in France), Versus managed to gain a cult following after its DVD release.

In 2004, this extended version called Ultimate Versus was released which included 10 minutes of newly filmed scenes, additional music, CGI, and a few editing tweaks.

Versus combines elements of multiple genres such as gunplay, martial arts action, chanbara sword fighting, zombie horror, and comedy. Kitamura believed Versus could have been his first and last film ever and chose to risk everything by adding film elements that influenced him.",1384646400,,855,5.519083969465649

1879275,5,B000095J2Y,"Now this was one of the first Japanese live action movies I have ever seen, and it was so ludicrous and brilliant, I loved it in an instant!

Even the plot isn't that stupid when you see the ending of this flick. Also, I totally love the silly characters like the cop/agent guy ecpecially, or the freaked out gangster, awesome. And the cool ones of course.. You get kung fu style fighting, you get swordplay, gunplay in a ridiculous setting mixing in the undead (it's a core feature of the movie, because of its plot).

About the Blu-Rays quality: It is definitely better than the Versus DVD ever was (I only know the german DVD though), but it is not what you might expect as ""standard Blu-Ray quality"". For that, the image is too blurry and lacks too much detail. But again: If you want this movie, and you don't have the DVD already, you may just as well buy the BD, still pays off.

To me, this is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen! Yeah yeah, I know what you're thinking, but just grab a beer or better two or three beers, and enjoy!",1361059200,,1048,4.282828282828283
1879276,4,B000095J2Y,"As many can already tell you this movie's razor thin plot and overzealous characters really probably belong in a mindless Saturday morning cartoon time slot. But what many fail to see is that the movie is so grandiose in its scale and intent to be ridiculous that you just can't help but love the camp, gore and action of this highly stylized movie.
The excuse to exercise this movie is loosely based on the premise that 500 years ago two brothers battled, good and evil, to gain the ultimate power contained within the mystical Forest of Resurrection. In order to preserve the power the good brother, Tak Sakaguchi, kills the woman whose blood can unlock the powers contained by the forest. Now 500 years to our present the brother and woman have been resurrected without memory of their former lives and being pursued by evil and a destiny they cannot escape. That is as much as I will give away but if you enjoyed the likes of the Evil Dead then this movie will appeal in many ways.
The movie never takes itself seriously and the actors, some more than other, take to the absurdity of the situation and their characters with such gusto you cannot help feel the campy charm ooze out of the seams. The actions scenes are well done for the most part. There is more blood, slice/dice and head shots that a Schwarzenegger movie except without the bad one-liners. Though there are several annoyances I have with some of the action sequences. You can tell contact is not being made during several of the fights and it makes it hard to suspend your sense of reality even further than you have already and this movie already asks for a mile wide suspension. The two cop characters felt totally out of place and meaningless in what is an already meandering plot. However the ""Suit"" cop does have some ridiculous gem lines that will definitely elicit a few chuckles.
The movie never really explains itself more deeply than the superficial back story in the very beginning but what is does do is take you on a trippy roller coaster ride that would not be unlike if Alice fell down a hole and found herself in Wonderland's demented twin brothers drug coma. All in all a rather enjoyable movie with an excellent twist in the end. The trick is to go in not expecting much more than action blood and some laughs and you will have an excellent way to kill a couple hours.",1358380800,2,2357,4.548235294117647
1879277,2,B000095J2Y,"I'm writing a review, finally, to warn people that this is a bad movie.  I'm giving it two stars because the gory zombie scenes are good and the lead actress, Chieko Misaka, is very good in what is a rather crummy role.  The script makes her spend most of her onscreen time just standing around looking helpless.  The main problem here has to do with the two lead actors - the good guy and the bad guy.  The actors may not be the ones to blame, though.  It's really the fault of the script and the direction.  There is no acting going on, just tough-guy glaring.  They fight zombies, with blood and guts splattering all over the scenery and themselves; they fight each other as well as each others' pals, throwing each other up against trees, rolling down hillsides, etc., yet their hair magically remains perfectly arranged and clean throughout this action!  Their clothes never get torn and remain clean!  They posture and pose as if they were shooting a fashion layout.  The ""hero"" poses on hilltops every few minutes wearing a leather trenchcoat and a smirk, as if saying, ""Don't I look too cool for words!""  The villain has somehow attained immortality; how he did that is never explained.  He seems to be involved in the black arts, though one gets the impression that the filmmakers have no idea exactly what the black arts are.  He is after the woman, Chieko Misaka, because if he drinks her blood, he will gain a new power.  Why is her blood special?  That is never explained.  What power will he acquire?  That is never told.  I don't think the filmmakers themselves ever had any idea what they meant by any of this.  The twist ending is idiotic, pretty much negating the main plot (as inane as it was), and made me feel that I really had wasted my time and money on this nonsense.",1358294400,3,1791,4.5062111801242235
1879278,1,B000095J2Y,"Did not care for this film.  It was very corny and I could not take it seriously at all.  I know it is a zombie flick, but there was no level of realism at all.",1353715200,,160,3.5428571428571427
1879279,4,B000095J2Y,"I will go ahead and say that this movie isn't for everyone. But for the people out there who don't care for something a bit different then you are sure to enjoy this movie. Yes it is a Japanese movie and that is sure to turn a lot of people off but I for one found this movie highly entertaining. I'm not going to say it is a masterpiece but it definitely deserves it's cult status and is sure to please majority of viewers. It has some corny dialogue at times and doesn't take itself to seriously at all, but for most people (me included) that is not necessarily a negative. For anyone who enjoys awesome fight scenes, zombies, and gore then you are sure to find something to like in Versus and it will NOT disappoint! I highly recommend this for anyone who enjoys a good low budget B movie, that manages to do a lot with such a tight budget!

As for the Ultimate 3 disc edition, it is mainly for the fans. If you are a fan of this movie then you have no excuse not to own this set. I am a fan and I definitely got my moneys worth! It has around 10 minutes of extra movie to watch, more gore effects, and a remixed soundtrack at parts. It is loaded with bonus features including commentary, the making of, and behind the scenes. It is sure to satisfy all of the die hard fans. If you are just interested in the movie and haven't seen it but would like to, then I would go for the regular Versus DVD. But like I said before, fans will LOVE this 3 disc set and will find it well worth the price! As for the people who want to see this movie but don't want to pay 20 some bucks for the DVD and end up not enjoying it so much, I highly recommend renting the DVD on Netflix or borrowing it from a friend if you can, and then make your choice from there.

Anyways, I am a fan of this movie and I could be coming off as biased, but i really think this movie has a lot to enjoy in it. To me, there is just nothing like a good blood splattered zombie fest! Definitely check the movie out and don't take it too seriously, and just have a good time with it.

I believe this might have been a half decent Anime movie if they had made one instead of this low budget dreck.

I have owned 3 different versions of this film: the nearly bare-bones R-Rated DVD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Versus/dp/B00009EIRW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Versus</a>, the amazing ""Ultimate"" 3-disc version with tons of extras and the added action scenes&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ultimate-Versus/dp/B000JBXP5W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ultimate Versus</a>&nbsp;and this new Blu-Ray release. As such, I can only recommend this to fans of the film looking for the best audio quality of all the releases.

I note the audio because the video transfer leaves much to be desired. It is a transfer of the R-Rated version with the color enhancements present from the ""Ultimate"" version but with the added action bits left out. However, film grain and heavy print damage is hugely apparent even though certain details are definitely enhanced. I can certainly chalk this up to the low budget of the original production but it certainly could have been handled better. For this, HD fanatics will definitely be disappointed with the picture. Fans of the film can pick between watching the Blu-Ray or watching the ""Ultimate"" DVD on an upconverting player and still enjoy it.

Audio-wise, there is no comparison: The Blu-Ray boasts DTS Master 5.1 Audio that offers the best sound of any version of the film and is fantastic to hear. Otherwise, the extras are all SD and have existed from previous versions of the film.

If you are looking to get Versus in any form and don't care about the HD or DTS audio, go with the ""Ultimate"" version&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ultimate-Versus/dp/B000JBXP5W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ultimate Versus</a>.

I toggled between the original DVD release and the blu-ray, and there is a significant upgrade in crispness and detail, as well as a nice layer of grain during close shots and darker scenes. No visible DNR that I can detect. The image is progressive and not interlaced.

The audio is great as well, with added depth over the original DTS 5.1, and even the 6.1 mixes. Master audio makes a hell of a lot of difference.

As for the extras, it settles somewhere between the original director's cut release and the Ultimate Set in terms of quantity.

True fans of the film need to own the Versus Ultimate Edition and this blu-ray release. I prefer the original that's featured on the DVD, but the Ultimate Edition has more extras.

1879297,3,B000095J2Y,"A review of the Ultimate Versus

I had originally purchased the 3 disc ""Special Edition +"" version due to some confusion here on Amazon but had since returned it in favor of the ""Ultimate Versus"" version.

The problem is that Amazon states in the product description that the Ultimate Versus running time is 119 minutes when it is in fact 157 minutes.  Check the photos next to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ultimate-Versus/dp/B000JBXP5W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ultimate Versus</a>

Put simply, though both versions contain 3 discs, the Ultimate Versus is 157 Minutes, whereas Versus Special Edition + is only 119 Minutes.  That's a 28 minute difference, basically a half hour!

Hopefully this clears up some confusion for those looking for the ""longer"" version.

So how was the movie....???

I'll keep it short - Its 3 main characters in supernatural tale of zombies (or resurrected souls?) + martial arts meeting in a battle for good and evil in a forest of ""resurrection"". The acting, and action, is a little over the top, but not in a matrix type of way. Hint - zombies use weapons and martial arts.

This is definitely a B-rated martial arts movie, though the story line is actually quite good. And oddly enough, you find that you can't stop watching... and may watch again!

To me, this is one of those movies that you'll either love or hate, thus my advice would be to rent it if you can find a copy, then decide if you want to spend the 35+ dollars for the Ultimate version.

1879298,4,B000095J2Y,"Zombies. Escaped convicts. Mobsters. An ancient battle between two men. And a forest that seemingly grants eternal life... one way or another.

More questions than answers are raised in the oblique, shifting storyline of the cult hit ""Versus,"" since director Ryhei Kitamura seems intent on winding eerie, bizarre plot twists all around the seemingly simple plot. It has plenty of gore, fighting and a brilliant debut performance by Tak Sakaguchi -- as well as a timeless battle between good and evil that apparently lasts throughout multiple reincarnated lives. And we're not quite sure which is which.

According to the movie, there are 666 portals concealed in this world, which connect to the ""other side."" One of these is in Japan, called the Forest of Resurrection.

Present day: Prisoner KSC2-303 (Sakaguchi) and his fellow escapee are met near the Forest by a gang of mobsters, but the already-tense atmosphere rapidly degenerates into a bloody war. And then dead bodies start getting up and savagely attacking people. The prisoner escapes with a mysterious girl (Chieko Misaka) whom the mobsters had been ordered to bring there -- he's compelled to protect her, and she seems strangely familiar to him.

The mobsters pursue the girl and the prisoner into the Forest, intending to kill them both -- but the prisoner and their crazy leader both cause even more deaths... and more gun-toting bloodthirsty zombies. So what exactly is going on here? Apparently a neverending battle throughout the centuries in this very Forest, over a young woman with a mysterious power -- and it brings Prisoner KSC2-303 up against an ancient enemy (Hideo Sakaki) whom he's fought in endless prior incarnations.

""Versus"" is one of those movies you should watch at least twice -- a lot of its cryptic twists and eerie explanations fly over your head on the first viewing, and you're likely to not really understand the underlying plot. While it's a cool horror/action flick on the surface, it becomes even more than that as the story of the Man versus the Prisoner is slowly unpeeled like the layers of an onion. Flashbacks, hints of familiarity, and a brilliant twist ending that turns everything upside down.

If there's a problem with ""Versus,"" it's that many of the questions raised are left unanswered -- while some are best left to the imagination, others are just headscratchers. But Ryhei Kitamura does a great job directing, with lots of gritty action, circling cameras and sharp jagged cuts from down on the ground.

He also liberally slathers the entire movie in vast gushers of blood, dismembered body parts (Sakaguchi bisects a guy in the first scene), and savage fights with guns, swords and fists. Tak Sakaguchi spins through the movie with savage grace like a blood-spattered ballet dancer, and he manages to make constant mayhem and destruction look easy and uncomplicated.

And Kitamura gives the whole movie a certain gruesome sense of humor -- there's a knife-swinging mobster who is absolutely cackling-bugnuts, and the zombies produce plenty of over-the-top gore. And Sakaguchi has a brilliantly tongue-in-cheek scene where he strips off a dead man's clothes, and poses coolly in a long sweeping leather coat (while the girl tells him, ""You're crazy!"").

This was only Sakaguchi's first movie role, but the gorgeous guy handles it beautifully -- he's all cool, sharp-eyed intensity, and manages to hint that there's something strange underneath the callous criminal exterior. Sakaki has an equally dangerous, lean vibe as the mysterious Man who serves as the prisoner's counterpart, and Misaka holds her own as a psychic damsel who is trying to stay afloat in a situation where nobody can be fully trusted.

It's rather questionable whether Versus' low-budgetness will translate well into high-def, mainly because it IS so low-budget and sometimes cheesily produced. Reportedly the blu-ray edition will have three discs, and aside from the usual multiple dubs and English subtitles, it will apparently have a bunch of extras cobbled from the previous DVD releases including interviews, trailers, featurettes, making-of documentaries, two audio commentaries, the side story short film ""Nervous"" and more.

""Versus"" is a brilliantly layered, twisting tale with plenty of gore, dismemberment and razor-sharp action scenes -- and if it didn't leave some of its questions unanswered, it would be the perfect cult flick. Definitely catch this one.",1253491200,7,4451,5.2025139664804465

And Ryhei Kitamura does a great job directing, with lots of gritty action, circling cameras and sharp jagged cuts from down on the ground. He also liberally slathers the entire movie in vast gushers of blood, dismembered body parts (Sakaguchi bisects a guy in the first scene), and savage fights with guns, swords and fists. Tak Sakaguchi spins through the movie with savage grace like a blood-spattered ballet dancer, and he manages to make constant mayhem and destruction look easy and uncomplicated.

And Kitamura gives the whole movie a certain gruesome sense of humor -- there's a knife-swinging mobster who is absolutely cackling-bugnuts, and the zombies produce plenty of over-the-top gore. And Sakaguchi has a brilliantly tongue-in-cheek scene where he strips off a dead man's clothes, and poses coolly in a long sweeping leather coat (while the girl tells him, ""You're crazy!"").

This was only Sakaguchi's first movie role, but the gorgeous guy handles it beautifully -- he's all cool, sharp-eyed intensity, and manages to hint that there's something strange underneath the callous criminal exterior. Sakaki has an equally dangerous, lean vibe as the mysterious Man who serves as the prisoner's counterpart, and Misaka holds her own as a psychic damsel who is trying to stay afloat in a situation where nobody can be fully trusted.

The special edition is a pretty well-stocked one, but rather similar to the previously released ""Ultimate Versus,"" so it's a good buy if you don't have that, but not so good if you do. The big difference is that this is the shorter Director's cut rather than the 157-minute one, and it's in a slimline case.

More questions than answers are raised in the oblique, shifting storyline of the cult hit ""Versus,"" since director Ryhei Kitamura seems intent on winding eerie, bizarre plot twists all around the seemingly simple plot. It has plenty of gore, fighting and a brilliant debut performance by Tak Sakaguchi -- as well as a timeless battle between good and evil that apparently lasts throughout multiple reincarnated lives. And we're not quite sure which is which.

According to the movie, there are 666 portals concealed in this world, which connect to the ""other side."" One of these is in Japan, called the Forest of Resurrection -- which apparently is connected to a long ago priest and samurai's fight.

Present day: Prisoner KSC2-303 (Sakaguchi) and his fellow escapee are met near the Forest by a gang of mobsters, but the already-tense atmosphere rapidly degenerates into a bloody war. And then dead bodies start getting up and savagely attacking people. The prisoner escapes with a mysterious girl (Chieko Misaka) whom the mobsters had been ordered to bring there -- he's compelled to protect her, and she seems strangely familiar to him.

The mobsters pursue the girl and the prisoner into the Forest, intending to kill them both -- but the prisoner and their crazy leader both cause even more deaths... and more gun-toting bloodthirsty zombies. So what exactly is going on here? Apparently a neverending battle throughout the centuries in this very Forest, over a young woman with a mysterious power -- and it brings Prisoner KSC2-303 up against an ancient enemy (Hideo Sakaki) whom he's fought in endless prior incarnations.

""Versus"" is one of those movies you should watch at least twice -- a lot of its cryptic twists and eerie explanations fly over your head on the first viewing, and you're likely to not really understand the underlying plot. While it's a cool horror/action flick on the surface, it becomes even more than that as the story of the Man versus the Prisoner is slowly unpeeled like the layers of an onion.

1879315,5,B000095J2Y,"whoa, what a fun movie, for fans of Takashi Miike's stuff, or over the top Asian cinema in general should check this one out. essentially it follows an escaped convict trying to initially cut a deal with the mob to aid his escape, but when things go wrong and people start getting shot, things get weird. the first dead body stands back up, only to be filled with about 50 bullets before falling back to the ground.

the chaos begins when our main character, a feminist, was introduced to the female hostage. after multiple warnings the gangsters wouldnt release her. after all hell breaks loose, the chase through the forest begins, and gradually our hero and the girl begin to regain their memory, and their place in a much bigger picture.

acting wasn't horrible, although pretty over the top. camera work was decent. the gore effects were awsome for the most part. the story was interesting but could've been explained much better. basically, if you want a non stop blood bath of carnage with too many guns, samurai swords, and body parts to count, then check out this movie immediately!",1216857600,5,1091,4.7368421052631575
1879316,4,B000095J2Y,"Let me start out by saying, I love this movie.  It is absolutely fantastic.  It's like Kitamura, the director, poked around inside my brain for my two favorite cult/indie/action/gore faves and put them together.  Because this film could not be a more perfect combination of Six String Samurai meets Evil Dead 2, with a bunch of martial arts action thrown in.  I absolutely love these types of films.  This is not one of those ""universally"" fantastic films that anyone can appreciate.  This is most certainly one of those 'specialty' flicks that only people with very specific types of tastes will love.  But if you have those 'tastes', you will absolutely be amazed by this film.  It really is a love it or hate it movie.  First, let's briefly touch on what its about:

A former prisoner tries to escape from an enchanted forest teeming with zombies and demons, all the while protecting a girl while kicking, punching, shooting, stabbing, and slicing everything that gets in his way.

For those who are looking at the different versions, the Ultimate is the only version to get.  The new music is a big improvement over the old stuff.  The extended action scenes are fantastic.  And the new color correction and visual processing definitely add to the overall film.  Plus, all the extras are great.  Ironically, this is actually more of a director's cut than the original director's cut.  The original DC was just the best the director could do with what he had.  Ultimate Versus actually had Kitamura going back out and shooting new scenes and extended fight sequences to cut into the original DC.  Now that we've cleared that up. . .

This is not a film for everyone.  In fact, this isn't even a film for most.  This is definitely a niche film for those that love movies that are just fun, cheesy, completely unrealistic, and straight-up awesome.  To most, this film is just a bunch of people running through a forest for 2 hours with some cheesy acting, lots of senseless violence, and more blood than your local Red Cross has on hand.  Yes, they do run through the forest the whole movie, but it's so epic.  The characters all have their ""cool"" turned way up, more than you would in any 'regular' film, but this is not a regular film.

The action is super mind-numbing.  The gore is super-violent in a very over-the-top way.  The dialogue is oddly paced and sparse and way more dramatic than is necessary.  Blood flows freely as zombie limbs fly through the air time and again.  But it all works.  This is not a movie to critique for film class or to be studied for its deeper subtleties and symbolism.  It is, in fact, unapologetically campy and violent.  If you're into 'gore fests' or 'action bonanzas' all done with that asian cool, then you absolutely must see this film.",1216771200,,2780,4.665979381443299
1879317,5,B000095J2Y,"So many Versus reviews and none talking about the ""Ultimate"" version.  I will make the synopsis short if you want a longer one read one of the other numerous ones here.  Prisoner escapes meets up with some Yakuzas, they have a girl hostage which the prisoner seems to know and does not like the fact she is being held captive.  The guns start firing and the prisoners escape.  This starts the film and the chase through the forest for the escapees.  Along the way of course guns, zombies, swords, and kung fu.

What has changed and what makes this the ""Ultimate"" version.  First alterations have been made to scenes :1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 32, 33, 34, and 36, which is 28 of the 36 scenes.  A new music score which is much cooler and fits the scenes much better has been added to a majority of the film.  Color corrections and CGI have been added to make the film more dramatic, clearer and a little more bang in each of the action sequences.  Compared side by side the image is night and day compared to the old version.  The ""Ultimate"" version is the director's cut with 10 minutes extra footage along with several audio tracks that you can choose from including a director discussion track talking about each of the scenes as you watch the movie.

The extra footage on this DVD is not just deleted scenes, but in fact new scenes.  The director and cast went out into the same forest and shot additional scenes and spliced them accordingly into this new edition of the movie.  The extra footage includes the reintroduction of the three assasins.  Originally they arrived in a car, now they are walking along a path in the forest and are met by some zombies which in turn allows them each to display their fighting styles as they whip some zombie butt.  There is more sword fighting scenes in the earlier part of the movie and an additional fight scene has been added between Tak and Katayama.  If ever a dream of the right extra footage could come true this is it.

This is just on disc one did I mention there were three discs!!!  Disc 2 includes a picture gallery with over 60 pics.  There is also 5 featurettes including ""The First Contact"" which is basically just a preview of the film.  ""Behind Versus Part 1: Birth of the Dark Hero"" which was on the original release.  ""Behind Versus Part 2 The Legend"" which is over 40 minutes describing the making of the film.  ""Sakigake! Otoko Versus Juku"" explains the reshoot of the film.  And ""Deep in the Woods"" is interviews with the cast.

Disc 3 is full as well with a collection of all the deleted scenes that is accompanied by commentary explaining the reasons behind each of the deletions.  A featurette ""One Man's Journey: Tak Sakaguchi"" is an account of the actor visiting the Japan Film Festival.  A interview with the editor is also on this disc.  Two short films are included Nervous and Nervous 2 which are basically side stories of the movie.  Whew can you say TONS of stuff in this edition.

Overall, if you are a Versus fan or it is the first time to see the film this is the version you need to own.  Well that is if you like more blood, more sword sparks, more action sequences, a better sound track, a clearer crisper picture and a more fluid storyline along with 2 CDs stuffed with extras.  Get the point well go get the Ultimate Versus it is by far the best special edition I have ever seen done to any movie on the market today.",1213747200,2,3465,4.374021909233177
1879318,5,B000095J2Y,"Who knew macho posturing and dumb tough guy dialogue could be so much damn fun?!  Versus is a movie that I had been hearing about for what seems like forever.  The gore, the violence, the overall coolness... you know what?  Everybody was right about this too, I SHOULD have seen it a long time ago!  There's over 125 reviews on here so it probably isn't real necessary to go into the plot much (or even write the review at all, but...), although I will say that Versus is the type of flick that's plot could be categorized as either deep and hard to comprehend OR flat out non-existent... you decide!  You see though, the beauty of a movie like this is that the plot just doesn't really matter much because ultimately it's used for the sole purpose of shifting the movie from one bad_ss action set piece to another, in all of their sword swinging, gun wielding, heart eating, zombie slaying, eyeball losing, awesomeness!  You might not always know exactly what's going on, but you'll be so glued to the action and mayhem on the screen that you won't care much either.  Tons of quirky and memorable characters, crazy stylish camera work and direction, and Tak Sakaguchi as the pinnacle of cool in the leading role all add up to one of the most entertaining cinematic spectacles I've ever seen (and I've seen some spectacles in my day).  Obviously this won't work for everybody... I mean, if 2 hours of near straight action (including gun-toting zombies!)only occasionally broken up by riveting dialogue like characters telling each other to ""shut the hell up"" while a camera spins around 360 degrees over and over again sounds repetitive, then yeah, you may want to steer clear (although that is an exaggeration... only mildly though!).  Versus is truly an experience to behold as a low-budget and genre-blending instant cult masterpiece, that even if you don't like (but really, what's not to like?)...

VERSUS is a cult hit from the beginning. Ryuhei Kitamura's film has all the ingredients for stylish mayhem: Zombies, Guns & Gangsters, Samurai Swordplay, Slick humor, a cute chick, anime-like fantasy and mystery.
The story revolves around prisoner escapee KSC2-303(Tak Sakaguchi, from Shinobi, Death Trance, Azumi) stuck in the ""Forest of Resurrection"" to seek safe haven. Unfortunately, the crime lord supposed to grant him this has his own motives and he finds himself against a mysterious supernatural opponent to whom he is linked. This flick is a stylish relentless, rampaging zombie action-noir-horror hybrid  that Hollywood probably wishes it thought of it first.

The difference between the R1 Ultimate Edition and the previous R1 Special edition are(actually the slip sleeve specifies scene by scene):
1) More Blood and gore.
2) It looked like all the fight scenes have been extended.
3)added: a renewal scene- Dark hero encounters zombies(3 scenes)more extended. Back-flips mayhem galore!
4)Zombies holding katana swords in the beginning scene.
5)Ohba extended zombie encounter scene
6)extended action sequence, zombie encounter- 3 Assasins going to the forest meeting a lot of zombies instead of just meeeting up with Matsuda and Ohba.
7) Katayama extended fight scene with assasins.
8) New music/new dialogue on some scenes. Added scenes appear a lot sharper than the film itself. The film itself is remastered, although it still maintains that murky look.
9)Extra CGI and color correction
And a lot more of added 11 minutes of action and mayhem!!

This 3-DISC ULTIMATE Edition(130 min) is well worth the money, I'm trading in the old 2-disc special edition(119 min). With an added 11 minutes of more action, mayhem and gore, this is a must-have for all Versus fans!! It certainly improved the original unlike stupid ""extended releases"" of ELEKTRA, AVP and THE PUNISHER.
 The only gripe I have is I wish it was possible to have remastered the whole film in High-definition(which is why I only gave it 4 stars), but looking at the original film's budget limitations when it was made, Kitamura managed to put every penny he can into the film.

But let me tell you one thing: This isn't really as good as people say- I did like the (amount of) blood, guts, entrails, etc., but the acting was LAME.

Also, call me stupid (If you want) for saying the next thing, but I was expecting a real pure straight action flick when I rented it, but like that one user said, Nobody said it was gonna be a comedy as well. There are a couple hot chicks in the film that I will admit made me DROOL, and but, Gorefest? PLEASE! It's soooo fake. Like in the beginning, when that samurai dude is beating everyone surrounding him. That was sooo cartoony it's hard to miss.

They just mentioned great fight scenes. So when the film began, I was scared at how shakey the camera was. But I gave it the chance it rightfully deserves, and I got a nice mix-up for a movie I was expecting to be simple action.

I must say that the one oddity of this film was the whole portals thing they mentioned. The whole thing about 666 portals is rather irrelivant. You just need to know they're at a place called ""The Forest of Ressurection"" and they were destined to be there. They'll explain why without the whole portals thing. I understand it, don't get me wrong. But, like the cops they occasionally show in the film, it serves no purpose.

If you remember this film is low-budget, you'll see how remarkable it really is. It's filled with action, swords, guns, zombies, the whole nine yards. And there's the beauty of a twist in the end.",1159401600,,1022,4.373684210526315
1879362,1,B000095J2Y,"This movie was obviously made by Japanese fans of several American films.  It then tried to mix them all together in one film.

The main ones are the Matrix, Reservoir Dogs, and Night of the Living Dead.  Especially the Matrix.

We have several yakuza meeting at a specified location where they usually bury their victims, the location turns out to be a forest of reincarnation so their victims are coming back to life.

Then it is a dead-come-back-to-life genre gore film heavy with feuding Yakuza elements.

Our main character has the long black Matrix type coat and general emotionless demeanor.  The high-tech 360 camera movements of the Matrix are blatantly being imitated minus the high-tech aspect.  Instead it is obvious that the camera itself is being moved 360 around the action.

I really hated the Matrix so a film mainly paying tribute to the Matrix already has a big strike against it.

As for the other elements, they were all brought in awkwardly and it just seemed to constantly extend the story with another element of their favorite American movies that they wanted to include.

The gore was mostly uncreative and uninteresting.

And there are throw-in characters who are completely unnescesary to the film (the two cops, one of which is the master of everything,) or villians that have no job other than to look cool.  A lot of waste for what could have been a really great film.

So why three stars.  Because there is genuine fun in the film making, which borrows a lot from the Evil Dead series and staples those films on top of a marial arts action flick.  And while the action never seems to end, that doesn't mean the scenes are poorly put together.  In fact, a lot of them are fun, just repetitive.  Plus it is cool to see zombies toting guns, I just wished they used them better to create some form of tension and excitement.

1879366,4,B000095J2Y,"The first time I watched this movie... I was baffled.  It had some killer fights with swords, knives, guns, hands/feet, and even a monstrous sniper rifle.  It had zombies, a guy that I'm pretty sure is supposed to be a toad trapped in a human's body, and a main character that knocks out whiny annoying females, which is super tough.  Apart from all that, it actually has a plot.  I'm still not 100% sure what the plot is, but I have a general idea.  The fact of the matter is, this movie rules, even without understanding the plot.  I've only watched it dubbed, because that's how I saw it the first time, and it's just hilarious.  During the slower parts (in terms of action), the mediocre dubbing makes for some good laughs that make it worth the time between zombie bashings.  Kitamura has probably become my favorite director in the past couple years, and this treasure is one of the reasons.

Kitamura's film Sky High is a much better movie, but this one is just fantastic.  I'd recommend it to fans of Troma films, anything you can laugh at and still think is cool like 2004's The Punisher, 2004's Dawn of the Dead, Army of Darkness, and any pointless gore/action/zombie/slasher flick.",1150329600,,1192,4.606635071090047
1879367,5,B000095J2Y,"Ryuhei Kitamura's VERSUS is a terrific blend of staple crowd-pleasing genres such as chambara swordplay, yakuza gunfights, and the vengeful undead. VERSUS plays out to the hilt with ultra-violent and self-effacing glee.

  When two escaped convicts meet for a mysterious rendezvous with a group of yakuza thugs, their unfortunate encounter happens to occur in the Forest of Resurrection-one of the 666 portals to Hell that exists in our domain. Throw a kidnapped girl into the mix, and watch as one of the cons declares his allegiance to feminist dogma before blowing away one of her captors. When his felled foe rises from the dead, chaos ensues. From here, the story runs in high gear and gives the audience little chance for a breather except during the occasional over-stylized ""poses"" from the actors. Other than these manga-influenced tableaus, Kitamura's camera never stops: zooming, panning, and spinning with dizzying speed.

  In what becomes typical for this film, just when things seem like they can't get any crazier, they inevitably do. The set pieces pile up in a savage collision that proves surprisingly satisfying. While too many action films run out steam in their conclusion, VERSUS manages to stay on track and in overdrive for its two exhaustive hours. An intense action pastiche, VERSUS raises the bar for all future chambara yakuza zombie flicks.",1149120000,,1370,5.176470588235294
1879368,4,B000095J2Y,"I debated for a bit how many stars to rate this. I decided on four because this Special Edition of Versus comes with some nice extra features, and makes it much more worth buying that the R-rated version. It's certainly more a ""guy"" movie than it is for girls, but women who are into extreme Asian movies will like this.

The synposis on the back of the box is a pretty good summary of the movie as a whole: Prisoner KSC2-303 finds himself encountering yakuza and their kidnapped victim, a girl with a powerful sixth sense. In the Forest of Ressurrection, the dead come back to life and ruthlessly prey on the living. KSC2-303 will soon come face-to-face with events of the past that have everything to do with the ultimate face-off at the end of the movie.

This movie is rather hard to spoil, as there isn't much of a detailed plot to spoil. Most of the two hours of the film are consecutive battles of every kind: gunfights, sword fights, zombie fights, human-zombie fights, etc. The movie is incredibly gory, but because everything is over-stylized, the action choreographed for various effects, it's not necessarily bothersome (at least, for me it wasn't.) I rather enjoyed all the action, especially as my main reason for seeing this movie was just to see more of lead actor Tak Sakaguchi. Tak's martial arts and top notch, but his acting may need a little work. Versus was also Tak's first big movie, so he's improved since then. His character is the typical anti-hero hero, or as he called it in the interviews, the ""dark hero."" He kill without reason if he seems to feel like, but still makes an effort to protect the girl.

Other interesting characters are the yakuza leader, played by Kenji Masuda. Just borderlining on being psycho, the character is animated and really doesn't hold back. There is also a rather cowardly and frantic yakuza member played by Minoru Matsumoto, who carries a traditional Japanese charm that he clings to throughout the movie. The intial yakuza members that you meet have a little more depth to them then characters that arrive later.

There various suspensions of reality throughout, and logic isn't anywhere to be found. Despite shooting their guns enough times to drain a storehouse of ammo dry, you only ever really see them reload once. (One yakuza member has a six-shooter revolver that definately had more than six shots in it.) Various long-dead zombies suddenly animate only when the yakuza suddenly remember they had buried victims there in prior visits.

However, the main point of this movie is not plot, script, or deep themes. This movie was made to be heavy on action and fight scenes. Director Ryuhei Kitamura says he was influences by early 80s actions movies; he frequently mentions Mad Max 2 and Commando, among others. So if you're a fan of that kind of action, you'll enjoy Versus. There is a little humor dotted throughout, so it's not just a straight-faced gun-blood-sword free for all. There is a plot-twist at the very end that should be an interesting starter to the upcoming Versus 2. (Yes, there is going to be a sequel, due out in 2007)

Overall, it's a good film for some serious action and fight scenes. The extra features make the Special Edition a little more worth the money. (An R-rated cut version is available through Wal-Mart, but apart from the movie itself, don't look for anything extra on that.) There are some detailed interviews with Kitamura, and an interesting behind-the-scenes views, including interviews with Tak Sakaguchi and the other actors. There are some on the-set bits, including interesting facts that include Tak breaking a tooth and 3 ribs. (Poor guy) There's also a short mini-movie focusing on the two cops who are chasing Prisoner KSC2-303, but otherwise, they don't make any significant contribution to the story, but are good for some gruesome comic relief.",1149120000,,3862,4.835098335854766

I think whoever called ""Kung Fu Evil Dead"" had the most accurate description of the movie I could possibly imagine. Plus, the little knocks the movie makes at ""The Matrix"" are really funny.

However, I must warn you. DO NOT WATCH IT ENGLISH-DUBBED! It has the worst dubbing I have ever heard. I owned this DVD for months before a girl I had over wanted to see it, but didn't want to read subtitles. I am convinced there were only two actors doing all the voices for the English version. Seriously, every male sounds like it's the same guy trying to do different voices. The only worse English-dubbing I've ever heard was in the Dutch version of ""Ichi the Killer,"" but that, at least, is funny in how bad it sounds.

Also, the R-rated version, which I saw first, actually cuts some important stuff out of the film. I rented the R-Rated version and then bought the special edition and there were two or three scenes were I was like, ""Ooooh! So that's why that happened!""

1879388,5,B000095J2Y,"""Versus"" is cheap. It's low-budget. It's trashy. It's funky. It's mind-blastingly stupid in places.

And you know something? ""Versus"" is gigantic trailer-loads of bloody, gory, brutal, uber-stylish and often beautifully filmed good times.

Let's review:

Japanese Zombies? Check!

Splatter, gore, intestines, brains, severed heads, arms, legs, and virtually anything else that can be dismembered and used as a club, truncheon, weapon, or engine of destruction? Check!

Cool leather trenchcoats? Check. Katanas and wakizashis and a fully locked-loaded-and-primed paramilitary arsenal that would make the 5th Armored Division blush? Check, check, check!

""Verus"" is Japanese director Ryuhei Kitamura's red-in-tooth-and-claw salute to flesh-eating zombie flicks like the immortal Peter Jackson's ""Dead/Alive""---and what a salute!

""Versus"" is just hardcore when it comes to hip: the too-cool-for-school Yakuza in their stylish shades, their tight-fitting leather trenchcoats, sleeveless leather battle dress, hip guns, hip nihilistic attitudes, hip giggles of bloodthirsty insouciance. It's all hip in ""Versus"", even when hip is slathered in blood and brains and gore. The Yakuza are bright plumed birds, so garish, so insultingly stylish, that you know they're marked for bloody death.

Not to worry. Death's no Game-Over in the Forest of the Resurrection.

Let's boil this thing down: you watch ""Versus""---no, wait, you BUY the unrated 2-DVD disc ""Versus"" for two reasons: 1) Gorgeously shot (on a shoestring budget) High Style and 2) Yakuza on Yakuza action!

Plot? We don't need no steenkin' plot! But since you asked: Mysterious Prisoner KSC2-303 (played right down to the wire and the Miso-soup T by Tak Sakaguchi, who swings that katana like a champ and wears that leather trenchcoat with an aplomb that would have made Marlon Brando proud) escapes from a maximum security prison into the mysterious, fog-shrouded Forest of the Resurrection with a prison buddy. A prison buddy, ummm, handcuffed to a severed hand.

What's the Forest of the Resurrection? It's a dark, spooky forest. It's a dark spooky forest where the local Yakuza gang buries its victims (with their guns, mind you). It might possibly be an ancient aperture to Hell, one of 666 that exist in our innocent world.

A mob pickup turns sour, chiefly because Prisoner KSC2-303 decides he's a ""feminist"" (I'm not making this up---he says it) and tries to save the damsel in distress. And really, that's what ""Versus"" is all about. Sakaguchi, girl in tow, runs into the Forest. Yakuza follow. The battling prisoners and mobsters discover that the brutalized dead have a habit of coming back.

Zombies claw their way up from the grave, strapped up with their best-loved gats. Blood flows like meth at a rave.

The truth is, ""Versus"" was shot for maybe 5 bucks (that's 500 Yen!). And the corollary truth is, ""Versus"" looks like it was shot for a lot more: it has style in spades, rolling spinning camera sequences that would make most professional Hollywood studio directors blush with shame, and---this is the most important thing of all---it's flesh-ripping good fun!

Be warned, though: this isn't a horror movie. It's not remotely scary. But frankly, it's cool. It's engaging. At moments, it's nearly brilliant. And the tracking shots---my God, the tracking shots are intense. The timing is perfect. This is all about honor, all about vengeance, all about the Death Wish stated, announced, consecrated and celebrated between the once-and-future hero (and long dead Samurai warrior) played by Sakaguchi, and his immortal villainous and way-chic sorcerer nemesis (played to the uber-wicked hilt by Hideo Sakaki).

""Versus"" is epic and hysterical. The movie is beautifully shot. The martial arts-work is tight and well done and very slick. The zombie do their thing and can even shoot---poorly. Blood flows. Fools get torn in half. Slaughter abounds. The Forest of the Resurrection is a Mecca for wanton carnage.

This isn't a cheap flick: far from it, and I'm sorry if I have implied it is. It has depth. It has ambition. For its miniscule budget, it is insanely technical in its shots and sweep.

He who becomes a monster gets rid of the pain of being a Man.

Literally.

You can choose to watch the movie in Japanese, in which event we noted that the surround-sound kicked in where the English-language sound was two-dimensional.  This may have been a fluke of our system.  God knows what they were really saying.

Any hoo, for a teen-age Camp exercise, the movie works, without the unnecessary misogeny that clogs so many American horror flicks these days.  This one is mostly about blood, and lots of it.",1112918400,4,1203,4.698564593301436
1879407,4,B000095J2Y,"A complex plot? I think not. This movie is over the top, covers nearly everything and everyone in blood, shows a lot of new holes in people, (where holes normally don't go and of unusual size), and displays a few vital organs with more blood sprayed everywhere. Even the two cops are over the top. I loved every gore-splattered minute.

Set in the Forest of Resurrection, which contains the 444th gate of hell, two prisoners meet a car load of thugs after escaping. A prisoner shoots one of the thugs, giving the white Mercedes a new paint job over the front, and then runs for the Forest. The forest has been used by the same gang members as a dumping ground for their victims. You can guess what that means! Yeah...zombies, with guns and anything else that they may have. The zombies provide the cannon-fodder for the most part, though some are fairly entertaining.

The acting is fairly sub-standard, but then one doesn't really see this type of movie for the sterling and touching roles of the actors. There are plenty of laughs, too, which add to the surreal quality of the movie. The humour is basically visual, with some situations that are just funny in their weirdness and stupidity. The over-the-top acting is also a major facet of the humour in the movie, playing off some well-established stereotypes of specific roles, (for example, the tough cop role or the psychopathic bad guy). This parody of stereotypical roles has been well done, and shows a keen sense of observation in the makers of the film.

For lovers of good, old-fashioned violence with zombies and a Japanese flavour, this movie is great fun. The movie was a laugh and worth seeing it. It will not disappoint.",1112486400,,1687,4.711864406779661
1879408,5,B000095J2Y,"Oh Versus...

To set up the small semblance of plot for this movie, on Earth there are 666 portals that connect this world with the world of the dead. The 444 portal (number is irrelevent) is located in Japan in a place called the Forest of Ressurection. Here the dead are allowed to come back to life. And that's where the main plot basically ends. And that's what I admire about Versus: The fact that they don't even pretend to make this about plot. Of course to give it some fair shakes, there is a bit more. An escaped prisoner meets up with a group of strange yakuza and when he sees that they have a woman he feels connection with. He runs off with her in the Forest of Ressurection after killing a couple gangsters. Unfortunetly the Forest of Ressurection allows these guys to return. Along with all the others the yakuza have killed over the years. A massive battle begins allowing the characters to show off their skills to audience before the real fun begins. When the main villian arrives, hell breaks lose. We learn that the prisoner, the woman, and the rest of the characters are somehow connected to events of the past. And that's where plot ends.

No, plot is secondary to action in Versus, and there are no punches pulled about this. If you follow the story you may find yourself confused about the circumstances of the past, and it can make you think a lot. But if you want to focus on the incredible amount of gore that went into this, you shouldn't have a problem. The movie is a non-stop fight between all the factions: the prisoner, the yakuza, the assassins who arrive, and the rogue cops hunting the convinct. The violence can be compared to the Evil Dead movies, in that there is a lot of tongue in cheek humor with the violence. Some of the dialogue is incredibly funny, especially with the subtitles. I understand enough Japanese to recognize that the translation isn't the best, but is above par with the kind of movie it is.

Mindless action? Check. Incomprehensible plot? Check. Weird sense of humor? Check. Versus is a great example of what is going on in Japanese cinema these days. Don't pick this up unless you are expecting nothing less then endless fights. Literally, the battle between Good Vs. Evil goes on and on.",1111968000,2,2251,4.553086419753086

I picked it up for $15 from a stand in a mall along with Junk ( which i haven't watched yet but will watch tonight ). the version I picked up is the extended version , which was extended for a good 30 minutes to much. Now, Japanesse movies are wierd there dialogue is wierd and some what cheezy but, this movie was not bad though the action was good the gore was very good the zombies were good, the plot was good even the acting was good. The ending, when i think it should have ended didn't it dragged and dragged which makes this movie seem alot worse then it is. If this movie was only 90 minutes its no problem and i would have no problem watching it again from time to time. But, this extended ending just really killed the whole movie. I would advise anyone to rent b4 you buy because japanese movies are way different than American movies dialogue is one thing along with just the style of movie that it is. Im not a big fan of asian cinema and find my self when i watch any type of asian cinema to always be 50/50 on it which is why im shocked i brought this and JUnk, but i am a big fan of Zombie movies so thats really why.

If you rented or bought this and thought, ""Hey, that couldn't have happened, like, oh my Gawd how fake!"" Why would you watch a zombie/sci-fi movie to begin with? You did read the synopses right? The acting was good, watch the original undubbed one please before you blast the flick! The characters were priceless, I loved the ""Charlie's Angels""-esque stances the yakuza guys made! Tre cool. I loved the fighting as well, every ten minutes or so someone was getting the crap beat out of them. It was also very refreshing to not see so much wire-flying, the one part I can recall that did sort of do that was shot tightly so it didn't seem so exaggerated. I'm a chick and I LOVED how Prisonor KSC2-303 kept hitting the annoying chick over the head, classic! No out of nowhere love scenes here my good people! The ""villian"" was also top-notch. I thought the casting was great. Tak Sakaguchi, wow, baby don't be so mean! :P I can't wait to see him in more things or in the sequal. Please don't watch this if you're cynical or hard to please.

1879423,4,B000095J2Y,"Versus is a a mega cool film.  It has got to be one of the coolest films I've ever seen.  The story is simple.  A prisoner escapes with his inmate partner and end up in a mysterious forest were the dead come back to life, and the ones who get killed turn into the undead seconds later.  To make things worse he is being pursued by Yakuzas for some reason(which I won't spoil)and the prisoner meets an enemy more tougher and more powerfull then him.  Acctually he is so powerfull, so invincible that it would take a whole army to take it down.  Soon the games begin and the tables turn as the story of Versus is told...

There is more to it but I'm to lazy to type it out.  Overall after viewing this film I must say this is a very cool film.  It has great action, some really memerable scenes.  The film also features some really cool things like zombies that are capable of holding guns and shooting them(though so slow they eventually get shot before shooting it)and there is alot of funny, cheesy dialoug.  The violence isn't as bad as most people say but I will admit the Not Rated version of this film can get pretty bloody and violent.

The film features alot of awesome gun action and lots of swordplay.  This is one of those rare films that really keep me entertained and this one really kept me entertained!  The film may seem a bit cheesy and dumb, especially how it looks like it only took these guys two days to make this film but it is still highly enjoyable and is one of my favorite films.  The film as I have said before has some really cheesy dialoug and some really cheesy action sequences.  Some parts look like a parody to the matrix if you ask me.

Versus is 119 minutes thrill ride for people who want lots and lots of great action and a semi-good storyline(by the way this does have a plot to the people who say it doesn't)and great violent sequences.  It has great zombies gun action, really awesome characters, not much character development but still worthy of a film and purchase(I baught the special edition of this)and has a great twist at the very end of the film(though a bit predictable)and shows what the meaning of good and evil/reincarnation is....Overall I give this awesome film a

4.5 out of 5 stars,

by the way I reviewed it based on the movie NOT THE DVD EXTRAS and overall DVD itself...Highly enjoyable film..worth a watch..

1879424,5,B000095J2Y,"Simply put, this movie is cool.  It has almost the perfect blend, action, visuals, complexity and we can't leave out humor.

The humor is not overdone in this movie at all, it lends a nice break to the edginess, some things are funny enough to be humorous but not overly so to be comedic.  I won't spoil this for anyone but it is a movie that makes you wonder who's who and what's what...the ultimate example of yin and yang, opposing forces and not the more simplistic and easy good and evil.",1104192000,4,493,4.336956521739131
1879425,4,B000095J2Y,"It's over the top. It's somewhat gory. It's fantastic.  A good, old-fashioned zombie film. It's true that the main group of zombies have little to do with the convoluted plot. There's no good reason for them, other than to show that there are zombies. But that's reason enough, in a zombie film. And these zombies are tool users. Not limited to shambling around, they. They can use swords and guns and generally just make a huge mess. What more do you want?

If you answer that question ""A satisfying plot,"" you probably ought to look elsewhere.  If you just want to have fun, though, this could well be the zombie movie for you.",1103414400,14,629,4.548672566371682
1879426,4,B000095J2Y,"I lived in Japan for almost four years; so there was time for me to come to appreciate Japanese filmmaking.  Versus was really popular there, however I did not get a chance to see the film until I returned to the US recently.

I did not know what to make of it at first; but I kept watching, because hey, it's a Japanese film.  I laughed throughout the whole movie, from the over-eager and psychopathic hitmen to zombies shooting guns, I really couldn't get enough.  I have to agree that the voice-overs were horrible, but that is exactly what made it even more entertaining.  I must say the cinematography was brillant and the ending is mind-blowing... although it does leave you with one big question.  I highly recommend it.",1100736000,2,727,4.596899224806202
1879427,5,B000095J2Y,"Don't listen to anyone who tells you this movie is anything less than great. A solid story backs up beautiful cinematography and the most outrageous zombie action on film. Japanese filmmakers have a great eye for compostiton and this film works it better than most. There's a lot of thought put into every shot and every part is connected. It's something you don't see in the quick-cut American action films or the long shots of gore in the Italian films (and their imitators). When a zombie's head is chopped off it flies out of frame and into a second shot where it bounces off someone else. Likewise with spraying blood. A fight between two individuals cuts to a second set of characters fighting. These two are momentarily seperated and one of the combatants from the first fight stumbles backwards between them. In print it's hard to describe, but on film it brings a sense of connection to scenes that are really utter chaos. It allows the action to go non-stop without boring or confusing the viewer. And that makes the chaos so much more delicious.

What really makes this film is the action. It barely stops for more than a couple of minutes at a time. There's no crappy computer effects (there is wire work)- the fights are fast, fast (yes that's 2x fast), and perfectly choreographed. Some zombie purists might bemoan the fact that the zombies aren't the traditional stereotypes, but you forget all that as soon as an approaching zombie akwardly works the slide on his pistol and starts firing. Though I'm not sure why the Yakuza would bury their victims with guns, it really doesn't matter. Zombie fans with open minds will love this. There's so many bullets flying and swords swinging you never have time to look away. Also, I've never seen a movie where the heroine is punched-out by the hero so many times.

Even though the story is a little bit predictable (except for the plot twist at the end), you never know what to expect next and the filmmakers deliver like you can't believe. It's not just a zombie movie, by the way. When you add it all up, the cinematography, the action, the comedy, and the excellent musical score make this one of the most entertaining movies ever put to film.",1099958400,4,2204,4.663239074550129

The director went back three years after the original release and made these changes.  Needless to say this movie rocks harder.  I have never seen better gun play, action sequences or as many.  Give it ten minutes and bullets start flying like saucers.  It's amazingly funny and quirky too with a host of bad ass characters shooting it up in ways that will keep your eyes glued to the screen.  I loved the head Yakuza guy with the green shirt and black suit, he is a riot and a half.  Also, the cinematography and angles chosen are off the hook.

1879441,5,B000095J2Y,"I can't stand it when people compare one movie to another.  We all know most ideas are rehashes of previous ideas.  Very seldom do you see a movie with a unique concept.  I believe these reused ideas are called cliche.  Instead of going into what other movies this one compares to I will review it independently and let you be the judge.

The movie starts out a bit slow at first and leaves you wondering where it's going to go.  When the violence starts and the zombies start coming out of the ground I had a fear it would turn into a zombie-fest, but it was basically just an excuse to have extreme gratuitous violence.  I normally don't get into super gorey movies, but I found this one enjoyable.  The gore is very realistic with the only off thing being the blood which is too bright--a minor thing.  Once you get past the initial violence and carnage the characters and story start to develop and the movie becomes very satisfying.  I really enjoyed the flashbacks to early Japan and the characters as they were back then and how the story ties in the struggle of good vs evil.  The fight scenes are top notch in my opinion and if this was a low budget film they sure did a great job making it seem big budget.  The only giveaway is the story happens in one location, but that's perfectly fine because the story requires it.  Most everything about this movie makes it one of the better action flicks I've seen in some time.  Story, action, humor... it's all here.  I especially got a laugh out of the cop that claimed to be a martial arts expert and claimed to have grown up in ""Yellowstone in Canada"".  And the part where he compared himself to Mike Tyson.  It's all pure fun.  I do think if it weren't for the story this movie might not have stood out like it does among so many others.  Unlike other zombie movies I felt the zombies here were convincing enough.  Minor quibbles:  A brief wire-fu scene.  Another scene where one of the guys starts acting like a monkey or some creature and they added in the sound he would make scurrying around---a cheesy sound effect that could've been left out.  Because I was thoroughly entertained and smiling by the end I give this movie 5 stars.  Oh and one more thing... *always* watch foreign movies with the original language and subtitles.  Dubbed is atrocious in most films.  If you want to enjoy a foreign film the way it was meant to be enjoyed view it in its original language.",1096329600,2,2433,4.423423423423423
1879442,5,B000095J2Y,"Versus was a movie that kept my attention the whole way through.  Very graphic and full of wit and humour, Versus is an over the top type of movie.  Every aspect seemed to be filmed and portrayed in a manner which exploited all charactors and situations in there most intense essence.  It was almost a cross between Kill bill, Terminator 2, and Fist of The Northstar(the series).  Many comparisons have been made to the Evil Dead movies, Versus is similar in that you walk away from it with a similar excitement.

1879443,3,B000095J2Y,"I basically bought this movie 'cause I thought the front cover was pretty cool (I even have a T-shirt with that logo on it). I read the reviews here, and figured I'd give it a shot.
First thing ""Versus"" started up, I was already groaning. The film quality was retro ""my neighbor's camcorder"", the acting was REALLY bad and it wasn't really living up to anything special. The music was okay, but I have a history of liking some strange music... also, sometimes the music is loud enough to where it's kind of hard to hear what is being said clearly.
About twenty minutes in (do try to last that long), the mood changes and it becomes more bearable, and then the story kind of comes together. It starts becoming interesting (which until then, I felt I had just wasted thirty bucks to see this movie).
The main character emerges (first twenty minutes will leave you going ""uhh... who am I suppose to be rooting for here?"") and they begin to develop what personality he has.
I really feel that this movie would have been better left in Japanese with subtitles. The voice-overs, where-as they match up okay were fairly annoying in general (the bad guy and the good guy were done pretty well, but everyone else sounds like the old Hong Kong flicks from the 70s with the whiny voices)
What I had envisioned was kind of a dark-souled samurai fighting the undead... What it ended up being was more of good/evil battle with the zombies being more of an excuse to fire off a bunch of bullets and to explain later events. Also, don't hold your breath for the sword-fighting, it comes kind of late in the film.
The ending was fairly thought provoking, and aside from the fact blood is applied with a fire-hose, and none of the zombies are really ""zombie-ish"" (they're live people with a lot of blood on 'em and it shows) Versus really wasn't that bad.
I'd probably suggest renting it, if you can find it at your local video store. This film is more for your die-hard martial arts/horror B-movie fan...",1089331200,9,1987,4.537604456824512
1879444,5,B000095J2Y,"I wanna open by saying that I was torn regarding the star rating. I'd say this is a 5 star action movie, but only a 4 star movie overall. And since it's Kcin's policy to give just about everything 5 stars, I went with the 5 star rating.
I first heard about this movie some time ago, and I can't help but wonder why I didn't see it sooner.  The plot synopsis alone seemed a virtual guarantee that it would be entertaining, whether or not it was good or bad.  It turned out remarkably well considering it had absolutely no budget.  Thus, production values suffer, and the acting is frequently a bit amateurish. (but still generally fairly appealing)  But if you are even looking at this film you probably aren't the sort who can't live with the natural concessions that come with a low-budget films, and this probably won't bother you too much.
The Evil Dead is the film that seems to come up the most when discussing this movie.  This is a bit confusing and deceptive, as although I would be absolutely shocked if the makers of this film weren't highly familiar with Raimi's ouevre, it's primarily just a modern action-martial arts film.  Which naturally leads to the question, is the action any good? Personally, I thought it was thoroughly entertaining, from beginning to end.  It's got a great volume of action, and mixes up the styles, starting with gun violence and zombies moving to hand to hand fighting concluding with sword fighting.  They do it all well, though I like the hand to hand fighting best.(The sword fight at the end is quite sweet as well, though it's hurt a bit by the use of wacky future swords.)  Also, although they use some interesting visual and editing styles in the film, they don't over do it on the action scenes and actually let us see what's going on.  The action here probably isn't all that different from what you've seen in a lots of the movies, though you probably haven't seen all this type of action in a single movie before, which is worth something.  It's got lots of frequently silly and exaggerated gore as well, which makes the already odd film all the more surreal.  This once again reveals the low budget, but it seems as if they wouldn't have wanted more realistic gore anyway, even if they could afford it, so it works out alright.  The zombies are perhaps a bit primitive, but I really like 'em, particuarly the samurai zombies from the opening scene. Too bad they didn't bring the regular zombies back later in the film, but oh well.
Critic's of this film frequently say something like, 'I don't know how anyone could take this movie seriously'.  Well, I gotta tell you, I don't think you're really supposed to take this all that seriously.  It's not self-parody, but it's got a ton of conventional humor, along with some gore-related humor.(which is always a dead give away that a film isn't all that serious)  Surprisingly, most of the humor comes off well.  The stuff with 2 police officers is generally pretty good, albeit not all that varied.  Panicky Guy and Crazy Yakuza guy are both fairly entertaining as well, though I can't tell how seriously we are supposed to take the latter.  He's still amusingly overdone, whether it's intentional or not.  The protagonist is merely okay.  He doesn't have much personality, but I don't really care.  The main villain is better.  He doesn't have much personality either, but he's real cool, to put it vaguely.
Even the non-action scenes are passably interesting.  They never go on for too long with out having any fighting, so they at least don't get in the way.  There's no dialogue I'm gonna be quoting or reflecting on anytime soon, but it moves the plot along anyway, and, as I said before, never really bored me.  The only time they falter seriously is in the scene where they introduce the Yakuza guys. It's trying too hard to be cool and they can't pull it off, so it just comes off pretty cheesy.  This tendency to overdo it comes up every once in a while, adding packets of cheese infrequently throughout the film, but as I said before, it's not all that serious anyway, so it doesn't disrupt the mood too much.
Well, this review is pretty crappy so I better wrap it up.  In summary, it's got a low budget, lots of cool violence, zombies and martial arts, is pretty funny at times and really never gets boring, although it isn't much for character development or plot and is occasionally a bit cheesy.  What can I say, I liked it. A lot.",1087689600,17,4445,4.577020202020202

There's more, though.  For one thing, some girls go kung-fu, too.  It's also got Matrix zombies with guns.  And a crazy gangster in a sharp black suit.  So watch it, why dontcha!  It's still better than half the movies Hollywood will release in 2004!",1085616000,,468,4.3604651162790695

  This movie says F***k it lets kick a whole lot of ass and then find some more ass and kick that too.  This movie avoids icky storylines and relationships and has the balls to simply make one of the greatest fight movies ever.

  Kitamura has weaved together kung-fu, deadly zombies, decapitations, mutilations, some great bullet ballet, and plenty of humor, thrown in all on some very cliched criminal types, filmed it often at a frentic pace, and waited to see what would happen. Hey what happened was fun for all.
  The only negative comes from a big exposition slow down a little over half-way. And boy does he slam on the breaks. But when we finally get back to the action it's a hoot, and its way over the top.
 As usual the dubbing is only so good and detracts from what appear to be great scene chewing performances, but other than learning Japanese what a ya gonna do?? The commentary included here is funny at times but is very lacking in real information.

1879464,3,B000095J2Y,"Welcome to the Forest of Resurrection: the violentest place on Earth!  Set in this wooded locale, Ryuhei Kitamura's ""Versus"" is a bizarre, yet strangely entertaining, two hours of camp that may well be destined for cult-classic status.  More a pastiche of styles than a traditional horror or action movie, ""Versus"" combines constant ultra-violence with some outrageously hammy overacting, tons of humor that may or may not be intentional, and dozens of zombies that don't serve much of a purpose but look really cool.  I can't say this is the best movie I've seen lately, but I can say without reservation I've never seen anything quite like it.
Kitamura certainly can't be criticized for wasting any time getting to the meat of the story.  ""Versus"" opens in the aforementioned forest, as two escaped criminals meet up with a gang of stylishly dressed yakuza thugs who have taken along a cute young woman whose role in the proceedings isn't immediately clear.  The problems begin right away, as the characters start bickering and it quickly becomes clear that a couple of the yakuzas are a bit unbalanced (one guy looks like he could have a nervous breakdown any minute, and has practically descended into a feral state by the movie's halfway point).  One of the yakuzas and one of the criminals are soon dispatched, and then things get really interesting when they suddenly come back to life and require a few dozen more bullets before they finally decide to stay dead.
After this tense standoff, the remaining prisoner (known only by his number, KSC2-303) and the woman flee into the woods, but things are just getting warmed up.  A team of assassins arrive on the scene, and they're accompanied by the movie's nameless arch villain, a steely-glared guy in a leather jacket whose youthful looks belie his age (more on that later).  Oh, and he just happens to be apparently invincible and able to punch through people with about as much effort as you or I might open a door.  Providing comic relief is a pair of cops, one of whom is miffed about his missing hand, the other of whom keeps making outrageously hyperbolic comments about his training and skills.  These guys also have their own motives, although what exactly they are is a bit unclear.
All this sets the stage for carnage on a grand scale, punctuated by some truly spectacular action sequences.  While ""Versus"" may be a bit lacking in the area of plot development, there's no denying that Kitamura knows how to create a set piece.  The movie's memorable moments range from a raging gun battle in a clearing with a small army of zombies, to a series of tightly filmed martial-arts showdowns, to the concluding epic swordfight between the two protagonists.  Kitamura's tense, often frenetic directing style reminded me a lot of another, much better movie that I saw recently, namely John Woo's ""The Killer.""  While ""Versus"" doesn't quite match up to that classic, the abundance of great action, combined with lots of blood and some stunning cinematography, still makes for an entertaining view.
Interestingly enough, ""Versus"" also reaches beyond the constraints of the action and horror genres to incorporate some mystical elements that might be out of place in an American movie but seem just right coming from Japan.  It turns out that the showdown in the Forest of Resurrection is merely the continuation of a struggle that goes back at least 500 years, with the forces of good lined up on one side and those of evil on the other.  The forest contains a portal to another dimension, and at stake is the villain's desire to enter the darkness on the other side.  The players remain the same, owing to the miracle of reincarnation, so there are some very old scores to settle.  And they will be settled before the movie ends.
By the time ""Versus"" does end, and in a rather surprising fashion at that, I was pretty drained, but I definitely got my money's worth.  I've seen some pretty mixed reviews of this movie, and I must say that I myself was rather unimpressed the first time I watched it.  I've given it a couple more viewings since then, and it seems to me that the movie is something of a grower, so you might want to give it some patience.  Some of the weirder elements in ""Versus"" might put you off a little bit, but it does have its own unique charm.  So check it out, if you've got the stomach for it.",1083888000,,4376,4.730263157894737

1879480,3,B000095J2Y,I liked this movie but for all the wrong reasons. The style of the characters particularly the martial arts sequences and even gun battles against a horde of undead were done very well. However the presentation seemed flat. It didn't feel like I was watching a zombie movie. Felt more like I was watching a Tokyo Pop video or something about the Yakuza. There are of course Yakuza types in this movie but they aren't exactly the bright kind. The zombies were done okay but it would've been nice if there were some of the undead showed more advanced signs of decay. But I am just being picky here. It's an okay film but I would rent it first.,1079481600,2,641,4.394957983193278
1879481,2,B000095J2Y,"It sounds cool. The DVD has a neato cover. It has a neat name. It's made by the Japanese (which already brings me to attention, I love Japanese films). But sadly, Versus ended up being nothing but pulp. From its start I had a bad feeling, as I saw the first of many canted angles that the director was using to cover up the fact that its characters aren't imposing enough in reality.
The entire film is like a single scene in a video game. Now, don't get me wrong, movies that emulate video games can turn out excellent. Versus however, never lets itself off the ground to supply a story to go with that video game. We begin on two escaped convicts who are running from their captors and end up in a beautiful forest. They meet up with a group of Yakuza gangsters who have kidnapped a girl and continuously insist that our main convict (I'll call him the Hero, because his name is never mentioned, and I still don't know it) and the girl must be kept alive because of anonymous ""orders"". Then the zombies appear from some lame plot device and then the plot vanishes. And there's a bad guy in there somewhere.
While totally banal and pointless, the film does do a good job with its real purpose, making good action sequences, of which there are many. The film has some absolutely incredible action stunts and fight sequences, and some cool-ass cliches that are so snazzy that you laugh with girth. The movie is also chock full of ""bishonen"", or hot, pretty guys, to satisfy any girl's attraction.
While including some fun shots and a few cool moments, they number 1 in 10, and so the movie still tanks. There is one thing it proves, though. Even through the banality of the movie, it still proves that the Japanese are the coolest people on Earth.",1079481600,8,1746,4.459375

1879484,5,B000095J2Y,"Welcome to the Forest of Resurrection, located somewhere in Japan. A brooding, oppressive place far from the view of prying eyes, the forest serves as a hiding place for many unsavory characters. Certain members of a yakuza gang bury their victims here. Escapees from nearby prisons melt away in its deep recesses. Sometimes these two elements meet, the yakuza and prison escapees, and all heck breaks loose. Maybe bloodshed in the Forest of Resurrection is a necessary event, part of a timeless struggle between the forces of good and evil. Maybe the most recent encounter between these prisoners and criminals is the result of some predestination of primordial origin beyond all human understanding. Whatever blood soaked events take place in the Forest of Resurrection, we are relatively certain it has something to do with the fact that this place is one of the 666 gateways to the underworld. The movie never informs us where the other 665 doorways are or what shenanigans go on there. Perhaps it is just as well considering the troublesome happenings in the Forest of Resurrection.
""Versus"" is a massively entertaining film from Japanese director Ryuhei Kitamura, a lengthy mind bending gorefest about the timeless struggle between good and evil. Think ""Evil Dead"" with an Asian attitude slathered with generous helpings of martial arts as you watch two prisoners, one known as KSC2-303, escape from prison and meet up with a carload of posturing thugs dressed in black suits. A lengthy, talky scene takes place as the prisoners and the gangsters meet on a deserted road inside the Forest of Resurrection. The scene seems to run on for ages until you realize it serves as a way to establish some of the characters. We also meet an enigmatic young woman who seems to know more about the area than she is willing to let on at the moment. Things go south quickly between KSC2-303 and the yakuza thugs, resulting in a bloody gun battle and the horrific realization that the dead don't stay dead in this scary place. KSC2-303 flees into the forest with the woman with the remaining yakuza hot on their trail. What follows are lengthy scenes of absolute carnage as the two sides spar with each other for possession of the woman, and with the reanimated corpses of dozens of victims of the very same thugs now roaming through the forest. Further difficulties arise with the arrival of an immortal killer, a few scary looking assassins, a couple of cops in pursuit of the prisoners, and the realization that the woman carries something within her body that promises eternal life.
""Versus"" delivers rapid-fire gore and goofy humor all wrapped up tight in an engaging story line. Heads explode, limbs fly off, and blood sprays like a geyser throughout the movie as bullets and swords rend the flesh of both the living and the dead. The humor is often ridiculously hammy, sort of a deft mix between the ghoulish giggles of a Quentin Tarentino or Sam Raimi film married to numerous running sight gags. As for the engaging story line, well, imagine a place where the same people endlessly reappear to do battle through the ages, but with a huge twist at the end of the film that makes you question the entire structure of the preceding events. Moreover, ""Versus"" manages to achieve a rather stylish appearance despite its miniscule budget. Check out the flashback sequences where all of the characters appear decked out in colorful, elaborate samurai garb, and I think you will acknowledge that ""Versus"" does a good job realizing its plot. It isn't surprising at all to hear about this film earning a place in the cult classic pantheon.
Yeah, the film runs a bit too long, and the plot doesn't make much sense for roughly the first half hour, but give it a chance and everything will fall into place. I recommend picking up the Director's Cut edition if for no other reason than you should always watch a movie in the form the director intended it to take. The DVD edition throws in a bunch of trailers for other Japanese films, a commentary track from the director, and a widescreen picture transfer. Good stuff, this ""Versus,"" and definitely worth a watch for the discerning horror buff. Is it the best film the Asian market has to offer? No, but who cares? It is still entertaining as all get out, gory as all get out, and often ridiculous as all get out. So, get out and pick it up right off. Some people hate ""Versus,"" and some people love it. Count me among the latter.",1076803200,41,4468,4.766451612903226

1879486,4,B000095J2Y,"I am still relatively new to the genre, but having seen and enjoyed ""battle royale"" and ""dead or alive""  I decided to continue down the slippery slope of imported violence/gore.
""Versus"" celebrates conflict...in fact due to the special nature of the woods within which the film transpires, the main characters get several chances to kill the same people, each demise more gruesome the first.  What the movie lacks in plot and dubbing (more a matter of translation e.g. ""You'll never hit me with a bullet that slow! My reflexes are 500 times faster than Mike Tyson's!"") it makes up for with esthetically pleasing battles and backgrounds, the utilization of a vast array of weapons, and a decent soundtrack.
The movie is intentionally humorous with the absurdity of its violence and outlandish characters.  Take, for example, the following scene:
Police Officer:  We've found you... prisoner KSC2-303 ...give me my right hand back""
[Prisoner KSC2-303 throws him a random, severed hand]
[Upon trying to re-fit the newly acquired hand onto the stump of his right forearm...]
Police Officer:  What's the big idea, this is a left hand!!
[Just as he finishes, his head explodes, leaving a soft-ball sized crater where his face once occupied.]
The movie can be confusing at times, but if you stick with it, things start to make sense.  As there are no lulls in the action, it's quite easy to maintain the focus required.  As a whole, the movie is thoroughly enjoyable and makes for an easy way to diversify one's collection of gore-heavy films.
DVD extras include trailers for Samurai Fiction, Kunoichi, Pyrokinesis, and Pistol Opera as well as commentary options with Ryu Kitamura (director) and either cast or Keishiro Shin (producer).

What is unknown to the convicts is that the forest is cursed by wicked magic which leads to a struggle for survival.  As the struggle begins, it is evident that their actions dictate what is good and evil, however, sometimes it is a little more ambiguous as to what is evil and what is good.  Versus is a film filled with violence and death that keeps repeating itself throughout the film, which gets to the point monotonously.  Nevertheless, there is an underlying fundamental idea that the actions make the person which can help clarify the ending of the film.

1879512,4,B000095J2Y,"Versus is another great entry in a slew of mind-blowing horror films to have come out of Japan in the last few years.  Versus wallows in excess with weird acting, overly long swordfights, 1000+ rounds of gunplay, Sam Raimi-style shifting camerawork and buckets of exaggerated stomach-churning gore.  This film reminded me most of Peter Jackson's early films, the cheap look of ""Bad Taste"" combined with the insane splatter of ""Dead Alive"".
The story focuses on prisoner#KCS2-303 who has just escaped prison thanks to some unexpected help from the Japanese Yakuza.  The prisoner soon finds out that the Yakuza's intent is to deliver him and a kidnapped girl to a client.  The client who paid the Yakuza to do the deed is a psychotic priest who needs both of them in order to open up a portal to ""the other side""(the girl and the prisoner are reincarnations of a mystical princess and her samurai protector, you see).  In one blood-soaked sequence the convict and the girl manage to escape the Yakuza and flee into a nearby forest, which is ""The Forest of Ressurection"", one of the world's 666 portals to ""the other side"".  The forest of resurrection also happens to be crawling with Zombies and with the Yakuza hot on the trail of the escaped girl and the prisoner the bloodbath begins.
But forget about the plot.  Versus' intent is not to tell a story but instead to show off scenes of ultra-violent excess and for that reason alone anyone ought to stay away from the R-rated version.  I don't see why anyone that's into films like these would have interest in a censored version anyways.  The uncut version contains endless graphic-to-the-core scenes of arterial sprayings, eyeball gougings, head choppings and exploding brains galore.  The film also has that strangely appealing look of a self-financed movie filmed on weekends with an 8mm camera by a bunch of friends with a little bit too much time on their hands (a la Evil Dead/Bad Taste).
My only minor complaints about Versus are the at times too ridiculous to ignore dialogue and its length.  I feel this film would definitely have sustained my interest better had it been trimmed by 20 minutes or so, its 2-hour length a bit too long for such a simplistic premise.
If anything Versus ought to be watched to enjoy the delicious performance of the prisoner (played by Tak Sakaguchi), a Neo from the Matrix look-alike whose ability to drop corny lines...and look cool in black leather is beyond reproach.  His performance is one of many things to like about this Japanese splatterfest which serves as one of the better ideas for a party film that I've ever seen.

This was before any DVD version had been released in the U.S., and I was stoked when I rented this DVD to show some friends. I am SO glad I didn't buy this version. This is an R-rated version and scenes have been cut. I don't know why anyone that is into movies like this to have anything to do with an edited version. (Ever see the R-rated version of Peter Jackson's Dead Alive (a.k.a. Braindead)? Same problem.)

1879517,4,B000095J2Y,"Versus is a very entertaining movie, but the quality of the DVD is lacking.
The vidoe quality is very poor, and the audio is just ok. There was supposed to be a DTS track included, but there is not. They were nice enough to leave the original stereo track as an option though.
There is a lot of extras that are available on the Special Edtion version, but most of them aren't very special.
Buy the DVD for the movie, and not for the presentation.",1063670400,,446,4.258823529411765
1879518,4,B000095J2Y,"I loved this movie.  If Tarrantino made an asian inspired sword and sorcery epic with the design team from the first couple of Evil Dead movies it would be Versus.
I'm not going to rehash plot here.  A few reviews here on Amazon already go through the story almost scene by scene.  The acting is passable, but we're not talking Shakespear here.  The fight scenes are excellent, but what really made this movie memorable for me was the camera work.
One school of thought is that if you notice the camera work in a film, the cinemetographer isn't doing their job.  The first time I watched this flick I was so pulled in by the visuals that I wasn't even aware of the fact that I was watching a movie.  I truly felt carried away by the film.  However, when skipping through a few scenes I really enjoyed a couple of days later I noticed a very interesting tool used by the filmmakers.  Each of the fight scenes is shot in a completely different manner.  An early series of shots where we have no idea what is going on is patched together seemingly at random.  Loads of quick edits get the viewer totally lost in the action.  You really get the feeling that you're seeing the coolest moves and effects, but it's hyper-real and very confusing.  At the end the camera pulls back just so we can see who is left standing and who is down.
Later there is a sword fight between two principle characters that is shot in a very interesting manner.  When the combatants are in motion, so is the camera.  When they pause between attacks the camera does as well.  Very effective.
The only mis-step, in my opinion, is the hackneed ending.  Where there are questionable motivations for all the characters involved and no one really even knows what side they are fighting for leaving a questionable ending would have suited me just fine.  The epilogue feels tacked on at the request of a bunch of studio execs.  Just turn the flick off when the last folks left alive get on the motorcycle and you'll feel like watching Versus was time well spent.",1063411200,4,2027,4.476839237057221

1879530,5,B000095J2Y,"Prisoner KSC2-303 escapes with a fellow inmate and flees to an anonymous forest to a rendezvous with a group of men who will lead them to a safer place. When the men ultimately arrive with a female hostage in tow and with fueled by more sinister intentions, they kill his partner and KSC2-303 flees with the girl into the woods, which turn out to be the legendary ""Forest Of Resurrection"", one of 666 portals to ""the other side"". It's then a non-stop battle against the living dead and cunning assassins to simply stay alive, let alone find freedom.
Although this movie showed about 20 or so minutes of zombie action (if you're expecting this to be a zombie film), it is still a very awsome movie. A very good plot, great effects, tight gore, great fight scenes and, everything you expect from a movie. Better than any Hollywood movie in my fact. Get it on DVD. This movie is a cross between EVIL DEAD and BLADE. BUY IT NOW!

1879531,4,B000095J2Y,"I didn't know what to expect when I picked this up, but it had a cool cover, it was in japanese, and it had an unintelligible plot summary on the back cover-- hey, I couldn't resist. So I borrowed it  and watched it. And watched it with a group of friends. And watched it again with my brothers. Which made got me some late fees from Blockbuster, but what the hell, I had a lot of fun with this one so I didn't care. This is what moviemaking should be- creative, funny, and most importantly, cool. And man, this movie oozes with coolness, and a sense of humor that isn't so pronounced compared with other asian cinema. This is an independent, Yakuza, Samurai,  Zombie flick, and man, it all comes together under 40,000 dollars. If I tell any more, it wouldn't be as fun.

1879532,4,B000095J2Y,This is a pretty slick zombie flick.  What it lacks in substance it makes up for in style.  The actors perform well considering the plot is a little weak.  It seemed like all they did was walk and talk in circles.  These guys also never heard of keeping the guns of the people they bury.  Besides those minor points this is a great movie full of frantic action and comedy.  The DVD is crystal clear with nice 5.1 sound for Japanese with subtitles.  There's not a whole lot of extras on the directors cut but it's still worth the purchase.  This is a must own for Zombie fans.,1062028800,,575,4.2592592592592595
1879533,4,B000095J2Y,"This movie is one part Pulp Fiction, one part Blair Witch Project, one part Jackie Chan styled kung-fu funny movie, one part Night of the Living Dead, one part Dead Alive, one part Seven Samurais, one part anime and one part cheese. What does all this add up to? A totally unique movie.
  Versus is all of the above mentioned rolled up into one twisted movie. The action scenes are good. They have an anime feel to them but the actors execute them with a Pulp Fiction sense of cool. Lots of gun play, there had to be over 1000 rounds fired in the first half. The sword fighting is really good. Very fast paced and gory.
  At times the acting is a little cheesy. The director is really fond of long dramatic pauses. A little too long for me. He must have gone to the William Shatner School of Film.
  The plot is weird and kind of hard to explain. Guy busts out of prison. Meets up with the Yakuza who have kidnapped some random girl. While waiting for ""The Boss"" to show up, the guy gets angry with the Yakuza, kills one of them. Guy grabs girl and the chase is on. And once ""The Boss"" (a 500 hundred year old mystic that kicks serious butt) shows up, the action really gets going.
  This movie is worth buying. But buy the Director's cut. The Special Edition doesn't really offer enough to warrant the extra ... dollars.",1062028800,,1321,4.298387096774194

Great acting, fighting sequences, and a great story line with alot of unpredictable moments that seem to pop out of nowhere..
Great characters...great cast!

1879536,5,B000095J2Y,"Wow! Talk about madness. This movie is one of the wildest ride's you'll ever take. But, don't listen to my hype or anyone elses... discover this movie for yourself. This is a nothing-barred zombie flic that really entertains. Some say it's too long, and while I must agree it can begin to feel repetitive, its so much fun you just don't want it to end!

The story here is surprisingly good (only because it's actually existant: there is a real mythology in Kitamura's world, and a pretty complex on at that), though the performances are as wooden as one should expect from the genre. But that aspect adds only to the wonderful dark humor present throughout the spewing blood, relentless zombies, and unlimited ammo. Not for the weak of stomache or heart, Versus will please just about anyone looking for a light-hearted, gore-heavy, relentlessly fun movie.

Media Blasters has gone all out on this Special Edition -- the transfer is almost on par with the Japanese disc and superior to any othe releases and an extra bonus chock-full of special features (the first disc contains multiple greatly entertaining audio commentaries). For a low-budget cult film, this is a mega-release!

1879537,5,B000095J2Y,"If this film could be summarized in one sentence, it would be ""Immortal samurais vs. Yakuza zombies"".  The film is about a convict that escapes into the woods with the help of some Japanese gangsters.  The gangsters also bring along with them a kidnapped girl whom the convict feels compelled to protect.  The two escape into the forest and are pursued by the gangsters, who need to keep custody of the two at the request of their client.  What the gangsters don't know is that they are in the ""Forest of Resurrection"", where the dead come back to life and that their client is actually an evil priest who needs the convict and the girl to open a gate to Hell, as they are reincarnations of a magical princess and her samurai protector.  Also in the picture are the Yakuza reinforcements and two cops whom I affectionately refer to as ""The Fighter"" and ""Stumpy"".  The film is all intense martial arts action and never slows down except to deliver the details of the plot.  The film was also made with a shoestring budget but still surpasses most of the action junk made in the US as it relies on a great plot and great action with real actors performing real stunts and martial arts.",1060905600,,1183,4.5
1879538,4,B000095J2Y,"Without giving too much away, this movie is a zombie/action movie at its best.  Basically, a priest arranges to have his henchmen bring a man and a woman to a forest (through the course of the movie, you'll discover their special importance), because they are the crucial elements in his plan to become very powerful. The forest, however, is known as the ""forest of resurrection"", where many bodies have been buried in the past, and start coming back to life with the arrival of the priest.
This is Independant film making at its best. while filmed on an obviously low budget, you wouldn't know it, as it has better production values than most american films. in the tradition of great old style horror type movies, noone has a name.. not that it matters, as most of em' won't be sticking around long enough. the action is well choreographed, be warned, its pretty violent, but its in the same vein as braindead - the violence is so over the top, that not only is it a joy to watch, but really sells the fun side of the movie too. The humour is sometimes subtle, usually in the form of the characters facial expressions, and their actions, but if your paying attention (and have a good sense of humour) youll find the comedy aspect of this great film, very prominent. The soundtrack is constantly kickin - really upbeat, and helps drive the action sequences along. And one of the best things about the movie, is the unique characters. Each one is a joy to watch -  a lot of thought went in to making them truely stand out. The only negative sides to this movie (if you could call them that) is the editing is sometimes pretty quick during the fight scenes (but its really nothing to worry about - it helps create a frantic atmosphere), and the movie is pretty long, due to some more ""artistic"" shots. To sum up, this is one of the best action/fantasy/comedy/horror movies ive seen in a long time, highly recommended.",1055980800,29,1916,4.550724637681159

The story line is a little ridiculous for a movie,  but would make a great story line for an anime (but this is just my personal opinion). The dubbing is pretty good.  It's not slow and it's synched up to the lip movents pretty well.  On close up shots the dubbing and lip movements look a little silly but it's only on extreme close up shots and it's only noticeable when you stare at the actor's mouth.

I have seen a lot of bad movies in my time, but this one has set a new level of low. It was by far the cheesiest, worst created movie I have ever had the experience to sit through. Nearly all the characters grossly overacted in the extreme, and there was no evidence of a storyline or continuity through the entire ordeal.
