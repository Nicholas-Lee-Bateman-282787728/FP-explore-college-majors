Each character gets fleshed out more this season at a well even pace.  It kept me laughing with Sota's fascination with anything small (namely his senpai, Popura) and the growing feelings that Mahiru has for the glasses wearing small lover.  Kyoko still hungry while Yachiyo still fawns over her, to Sato's growing frustration and Soma's amusment (if Sato doesn't beat up the troll with a  pan that is!)

Yamada is still Yamada as she is the butt of jokes in some episodes but she always tries her best which makes it amusing to see.  And let's not forget the Takanashi sisters as they also get expanded on as well!

This series is enjoyable as since, as an anime fan, I get burnt out with a lot of panty shots and over sexing female characters and it's nice to take a break and watch the slice of life melodrama of ""normal"" characters with no special powers, (if you don't count Mahiru knocking out any male she sees due to her phobia).

I suggest watching the first season to get you started to see how it begins but it's not major given the pace of the show.",1421884800,,1110,4.380487804878049
8639480,5,B00I5U16EQ,"This is a first rate followup for the first season of Wagnaria!! ( Working!! as it is titled in Japan, couldn't be copyrighted in USA ) More situations with the eccentric crew at the Sapporo Wagnaria restaurant ( It makes me wonder what the rest of that chain's locations would be like if it was real. ) along with some good character development for each of the members.  There is supposed to be a third season in the works so perhaps we will get a satisfying end for the various stories.",1413158400,,489,4.373626373626373
