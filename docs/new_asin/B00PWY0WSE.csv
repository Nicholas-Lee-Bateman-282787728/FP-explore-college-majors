6824845,5,B00PWY0WSE,One of the most insightful documentaries I have seen about the education system in a long time,1423440000,,94,4.588235294117647
6824846,5,B00PWY0WSE,"An important documentary, educating its audience about education under difficult circumstances. The determination of both teachers and students is inspiring.",1423440000,,157,6.9
6824847,5,B00PWY0WSE,"An emotional, beautiful, and very honest portrait of the struggles and successes in public education today.  A must watch for teachers!",1423440000,,135,5.428571428571429
6824848,5,B00PWY0WSE,"This is a powerful and engaging documentary about public education that should be of interest to all teachers, public and private and those who care about them. Particularly those who are working in less privileged settings. The story of this principal's struggle to revitalize a Bed-Stuy public high school with a program of strong individual support & inquiry-based instruction is unflinching in its look at the tough realities facing students and the challenges for the teachers and administrators trying to make a difference in their lives.",1423440000,,544,5.337209302325581
6824849,5,B00PWY0WSE,"As one of the main subjects in this film, I stand by its integrity. The New Public faithfully depicts my own struggles and achievements as well as those of my students, parents, and the school community as a whole. To be sure, it has been difficult to watch myself flounder in front of a national audience but if my personal drama is edifying I'm okay with it.  I've used this film in my high school classroom and I've attended numerous screenings for educators and the public alike and I've witnessed howl this film raises crucial issues for our society as a whole. This is not just a sociological film, but a beautiful piece of filmmaking intimate, entertaining, and at times genuinely funny.",1423008000,4,694,4.688524590163935
6824850,5,B00PWY0WSE,"Truly great story telling and consciousness raising regarding the education crisis in America.
Get to know these characters. its worth it!",1423008000,,138,5.619047619047619
6824851,5,B00PWY0WSE,"I loved this film. Often a film like this either addresses the ""issue"", or follows it's characters and really gets inside their lives. This film does both. I discover the joys and problems about educating young people today in the inner city by being there, with them. BRAVO to great doc filmmaking. It's a great watch, with tons of heart and surprising laughs.",1423008000,,361,4.746031746031746
6824852,5,B00PWY0WSE,"An important, smart and moving film that anyone who is interested in education should watch. And if you're not interested in education, you're a dummy and is even more reason for you to watch this film.",1423008000,,202,4.638888888888889
6824853,5,B00PWY0WSE,"Joe Nocera of The New York Times wrote an op-ed about this film, calling it  ""...an unwitting primer on how to teach disadvantaged students."" He went on to note that  ""...As the country continues to struggle with education reform, it seems obvious that education schools need to change, so that prospective teachers walk into their first classroom knowing how to teach. Maybe The New Public can help bring about that change.""
On top of all that, it is also an emotional character driven film about individuals you really root for, and come away with a sense that education is much bigger than school. I highly recommend it.",1423008000,,623,4.813084112149533
8689590,5,B00PWY0WSE,"An intense documentary about the real issues that students in high poverty public schools face, and the valiant efforts of parents and teachers and student to succeed, despite everything.",1432598400,,187,5.482758620689655
8689591,5,B00PWY0WSE,Good documentary about challenging reality of new progressive schools,1428278400,,69,6.777777777777778
8689592,5,B00PWY0WSE,"Went far beyond my expectations for an educational documentary. I was wary of the non-conventional style used in its production, but I can honestly say it was one of the most enlightening documentaries I have ever watched. The viewer is able to see all aspects of the high school - the good, and especially the bad. There was no sugar-coating or hiding the downfalls, rather, they were highlighted as learning experiences for the administration. It was refreshing to see real life application of education principles when teaching inner-city students, instead of just reading about theories. By the end of the documentary, I had a vested interest in every student, teacher, and administrator, and even shed a few tears. Great documentary! Best of luck BCAM!",1424995200,2,757,5.112903225806452
8689593,5,B00PWY0WSE,"This gem of a film has profound relevance as we grapple with how to do public school right. By focusing on the students and teachers and their struggles, rather than trying to put them to use in pushing an ideological position in the education policy debates, it encourages the viewer to think more deeply, critically, and analytically. This sets it far apart from--and above--films like ""Waiting for Superman."" And as much as the film provides terrific food for thought, it completely engages the viewer emotionally.",1424736000,,517,5.094117647058823
8689594,5,B00PWY0WSE,There are good teachers doing good work in our schools today. This is a film that challenges the dominant discourse about failing teachers and failing schools. Thank you for making it.,1424736000,,184,4.967741935483871
8689595,5,B00PWY0WSE,Both inspiring and deeply provocative. A true picture of all the complexity of public school education. Characters are riveting and doc style amazing!,1424736000,,150,5.565217391304348
8689596,5,B00PWY0WSE,As a new teacher this is real to everyday life in a NYC Public school. I appreciate knowing that I am a normal person who has feelings,1424476800,,134,4.0
8689597,5,B00PWY0WSE,"At the beginning of this film I was certain that it would be another superficial story about how easy it would be to reform the education system if only people would try harder, be more dedicated, spend more money, etc. But this movie is about much, much more than that. It shows the reality of the enormous obstacles that educators and students and their families face. It is an in-depth look at what is a crisis in this country. It's riveting.  It's a remarkable film. Watch it.",1423526400,,480,4.517241379310345
8689598,5,B00PWY0WSE,This is the type of film that digs into a complex subject and never once flinches or goes for the easy answer. Watch this with a friend and find yourself talking about it for hours afterward. With fly on the wall filmmaking the only way to feel closer to the subject would be to be them.,1423526400,,287,4.142857142857143
8689599,5,B00PWY0WSE,"A fascinating film, both heartbreaking and exciting, it is worth seeing over and over again. The complicated world it documents so carefully is one we all need to understand better.",1423526400,,181,5.066666666666666
