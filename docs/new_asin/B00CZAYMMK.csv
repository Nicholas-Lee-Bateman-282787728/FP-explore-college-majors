5763713,5,B00CZAYMMK,I Love Big Time Rush and i will never forget the memory of my favorite Boy band Rushers Forever :),1378684800,,98,3.95
5763714,5,B00CZAYMMK,"If you area BTR fan you will love this movie I know I did! It was great, I highly recommend it to watch!",1377475200,,104,3.5652173913043477
5763715,2,B00CZAYMMK,"I am a huge BTR fan and yet I can only (barely) give this DVD 2 stars.  What I was expecting to see was behind-the-scenes clips of what it takes to be in a boy band -- long days on the set, seeing them lay down tracks in the studio, learning choreography, traveling on the road, etc.  Not even close.  What you mostly get are 3 interviews which can be found on YouTube with an incredibly annoying woman's voice narrating this documentary in between said interviews.  This DVD was a big disappointment and the ""heads"" should have spent their time and effort putting seasons 2,3 and 4 out on DVD instead on making ""Elevation"".",1377475200,3,624,4.447368421052632
5763716,1,B00CZAYMMK,"BTR's ""Elevation"" never gets off the ground. I am not sure what I expected in the first place; yes I do. I expected something associated with BTR to be good! This so-called documentary wasn't worth the dvd it was recorded on. And this all pains me to say because I DO LOVE BIG TIME RUSH!!!! I just can't for life of me figure out how Kendall, Logan, Carlos, and James and anyone in their close circle got talked into letting this mess get released. The only explanation I can come up with is that maybe, MAYBE, they were under contract and had no control over it. However, considering that they have input for their tours,  routines, wardrobe, and writing songs; that  choice doesn't hold much weight either. If you're looking for a dvd of interviews that could've been done in my basement then this is for you. But, if you want a great BTR experience:SAVE YOUR MONEY, SEE THEM IN CONCERT LIVE!!! I hope the next dvd they put out is of their concerts. Otherwise who knows, One Direction just might take them over for good. They already have a concert out on dvd. Let's hope that BTR rebounds, puts their WINDOWS DOWN and moves forward. Because we know that not only is the CITY OURS but the WORLD!!!!!",1377043200,4,1201,4.47945205479452
5763717,1,B00CZAYMMK,"This is not a documentary. It is 3 youtube interviews on dvd, with some general facts from wikipedia narrated between them.

As a long time fan of BTR, I was excited to see this film. I thought that finally someone would be showing the hard work that they've put in over the years, but sadly this is not the case. I know this was an ""unauthorized"" documentary, but it's like the directors didn't even try. There is so much footage and information available that a nice film could have been made. It comes off as a project done at the last minute with little effort.

I would not recommend this dvd to anyone. The only person who would really benefit from this would be someone who knew NOTHING about Big Time Rush, but they should save themselves the $10 and just google them. They'll find these same 3 interviews and more by doing so.",1376524800,13,835,4.415584415584416
5763718,3,B00CZAYMMK,"The DVD promises to be a ""documentary,"" but it's not really. It's 3 various interviews (two of which are the most recent ones at Cambio and Huffington Post) that are mostly available online. On the plus side, they're not chopped up like online.

But if by ""documentary,"" you expected to see Kendall's audition (clip online) or a few words from Scott Fellows about the show's early development, or anything about the boys' individual filmographies pre-BTR, interviews with the boys, behind-the-scenes of how their tours or autograph signings happen, or pretty much anything else that's typical for a ""documentary,"" you'll be disappointed.",1376524800,7,637,5.306930693069307
5763719,5,B00CZAYMMK,"I loved watching this dvd of Big Time Rush I loved the interviews and seeing how far they have come.

It could have been long but It was worth the money buying this dvd.

I have seen them in concert 2 times now and this is a dvd to add to my collection of Big Time Rush dvd's.",1376006400,,276,3.7413793103448274
5763720,2,B00CZAYMMK,"I'm very sad to say, but this DVD was clearly just thrown together. It hardly had a narrative or facts about the groups life. It was nothing more than just a few of their interviews thrown together with a few clips in between with the narrator saying the obvious. Even the title screen only had ""Play Movie"" and ""Scenes."" Basically it wasn't worth the money spent on it; it looked like it was made on a home computer. There wasn't a real ending. All-in-all, I am disappointed.",1375920000,16,476,4.482758620689655
5763721,1,B00CZAYMMK,"I love BTR. However this DVD can be summed up with one word. Disappointed!! This ""Documentary"" is nothing more than spliced YouTube posts of their interview with Brian Douglas, Huff Post interview and Cambio Chat with some filler vid between and slight voice over. Save your money.",1375920000,17,281,5.0
