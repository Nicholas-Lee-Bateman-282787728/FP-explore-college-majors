6508222,4,B00LVZK1FW,"Honestly this and Friday the 13th case past over kill . It was interesting . This movie was a period I watch quote horror movies if wanted humor and expected still do at least 50 to 60 percent of the time comedy to be stupid . Was listening to a stand up talking about state slip knot is from . Quote heritic athem is results of nothing to do and lots corn . Shawn of dead is best example of comedy I think of nightmare on elm Street at times . Children of corn movies aren't totally joke horror . Problem real world is scary news , point news sources reporting Elvis is getting on with Jesus in microwave ovens is only way Donald Trump's despite billionaire files bankruptcy how many times equiror gets it elected is pure horror . Freaking horror movies  vs news to scare me news usually beats the living or undead or unliving crap out horror movies . Latex y'all enjoy",1522540800,,870,4.2727272727272725

6508239,4,B00LVZK1FW,"If you like this series, you cannot go wrong...unless you're ripping them to your HDD. It can be done, but it takes a little patience and knowledge of finding the right file on the right disc in addition to have the correct software to complete the rip. Would have received 5 stars if it wasn't for the problems in making a personal back-up copy to HDD! (which everybody is entitled to do,regardless of CR policy) Remember, DVD's and BD's do not last for eternity, they eventually wear out (even in storage)",1487289600,2,507,4.582417582417582
