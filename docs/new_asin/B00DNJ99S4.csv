8595062,5,B00DNJ99S4,Great pulp horror movie loaded with beautiful women.  Think: Texas Chainsaw Massacre in Germany.  Absolutely gruesome!,1529539200,,118,6.3125

8595064,1,B00DNJ99S4,"Hahaha... nearly lost my beverage via my nose... not only filmed in the woods near my hometown, but also the worst movie seen in along time. looks like 'twas filmed with cheap camcorders and cellphones and has wooden acting plus stupid dialogs to boot. The semi-hot chicks in various states of undress hold your attention until the 'infected' first come into view... wtf? had to turn it off after that, couldn't take it seriously from there on. and: uncut? stfu... who are you kiddin'? nothing happens anyway... avoid. if not: you've been warned.",1419552000,2,546,4.881720430107527
8595065,1,B00DNJ99S4,"Didn't really research reviews before buying. I guess like many uninformed mindless buyers I fell for the cover art.
Don't make the same mistake I made. Like a previous reviewer already mentioned there are no character developments among other things it lacks. Movie probably cost like $20 bucks to make and it shows. The movie does not deliver in the T&A and gore department neither. The main girl with the biggest knockers never flashes. All those accolades on the top of the box are bs!!!",1387929600,10,491,4.788235294117647
8595066,5,B00DNJ99S4,"The film revolves around some hot german women who give you so many reason to keep watching this film. This horror film has it all, we get nudity, we get blood, we get crazy german cannibals, and we get beautiful women put in some insane situations. The film does get a little predictable and lacks some originality and creativity, but this is cheesy horror fun at its finest! Its also got some great cover art, and from that I know this film shouldn't be taken seriously. This is the type of horror film that you can pop in, sit back, get a drink, and have some fun watching some great sleazy horror!",1385942400,2,601,4.375
8595067,1,B00DNJ99S4,"OK, here goes. It starts with what looks like ""found footage."" Three German girls, who all speak German given the subtitles, go camping and upon hearing something scatter hither and thither. Three others, one of whom (Brenda Busen) is in the shower, are expected to arrive also. Brenda arrives in a car that gets stolen and promptly wanders off after having been directed by some drunk to go the other way. The other two arrive in a mini-moke and who knows what happens to them thereafter, except that one gets attached to a tree. It was probably leaning anyway.
The point is, that in 75 minutes, there is no possibility for character development, not that you could care anyway. The story barely gets underway halfway through the film - underground. The problem with this is that you can't see what's going on. Brenda, having been loosely captured by these darkened individuals, gets away and if one person could scatter hither and thither, she manages it.
Then out comes the night-cam and the striptease just so that Brenda can whack the filmer with the camera. It also gives the observant a chance to notice that Brenda has changed her underwear.
Brenda runs away straight into the arms of some sort of mutant and that's about it.
I am a big fan of foreign horror and a film with this sort of title has a lot of promise. It just fails to deliver anything. No rump steak, no breast of anything, nor leg, nor thigh. In fact, nobody sits down to any kind of meal. Of the six girls who started out, five disappeared without explanation and, as far as I'm concerned, if you have to film in very low light, you have something to hide. In this case the inadequacies of the film...
""Hie und da"" means ""Here and there."" You'll see why if you don't take my advice and avoid this. Invest your time and money in this crap if you must. I only held on to see if Brenda showed her Busen.",1384473600,12,1875,4.469387755102041
