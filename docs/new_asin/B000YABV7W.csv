3024331,4,B000YABV7W,"i have to say, i'm surprised by the just awful reviews this movie got.
i'm not a film critic, by any stretch, but i think that this is the perfect example of people expecting too much from a film.

this is a fun, family style, christmas movie with enough humor for the adults to have a good time, too. i enjoyed all the actors, by and large, and thought they were having a good time, which maybe was what helped me enjoy it so much. i mean, how can you not like vince vaughn's smarmy bulls***??? ok, i know a lot of people who don't - but then you're not gonna like it anyway! if you do like vaughn, this is him but PG style.

if you're going in expecting It's a Wonderful Life, you're going to be disappointed. if you go in hoping it's better than Saving Christmas, you'll be stoked, cos it is.",1222128000,,795,4.122580645161291
3024332,2,B000YABV7W,"How hard is it to write a watchable film with Vince Vaughn, Paul Giamatti and Kevin Spacey? Apparently VERY difficult for the writers here.

I still have no idea how Santa is younger and looks 20 years older than Vince (who plays the BIG brother). I must have missed that part of the story but in reality, it really didn't matter. Many scenes seemed out of place and contrived; the kind of ""funny notion"" scenes that are drug out WAY too far to where any sense of comedy is lost.

The director/producer tried to go ""tear jerker"" at the end, which would have been suitable if ANYTHING leading up that point had been worth following.

Ugh, major disappointment. I can see how some people might enjoy this OK, since many people will take any garbage they're fed, but I would strongly encourage waiting for DVD on this one. NOT worth the $23,978 it takes to get your family to the movies these days.",1217548800,7,895,4.478527607361963
3024333,4,B000YABV7W,"I read many reviews from both Amazon and other print sources and the overwhelming reaction to Fred Claus was one of disappointment and worse. This won't be the first nor last time I am glad I looked into something for myself instead of trusting others. I don't know if it is my own sordid, pathetic personal life history or what, but this movie touched me and I left the movie emotionally moved and struck by how something advertised as your typical holiday comedy fare (read: stupid and infantile) could have delivered such a blow to my heart.
Vince Vaughn, who is the Bill Murray of his generation, delivers an endearing performance, Paul Giamatti is, as always, brilliant, and the rest of the cast is very good. The plot is simple enough but the undercurrent of family relationships and how they can influence people throughout their life hit me hard. One last positive - the soundtrack is a wonderful mix of seasonal favorites old and new with the bonus of a haunting Silent Night by Sinead O'Connor (which just sent me over the teary edge) and the Over the Rainbow/Wonderful World medley by the Hawaiian singer whose name I can neither remember nor spell.
Fred Claus will not make you throw out It's A Wonderful Life or even Rudolph the Reindeer, but it is heartwarming and deserves to be judged before dismissed as yet another warmed over holiday leftover.",1195516800,81,1362,4.726890756302521
3024334,4,B000YABV7W,"This movie was seen by my 7 and 5 year old grandsons and myself.  They both enjoyed the entire film (as I did).  They both also got the object lesson!  Families aren't perfect, don't always get along, have issues, but in the end they stick together.  They talked about how Fred and Nicholas treated each other for two days after, and what was right and what was wrong.  It may not be a classic, but these two little boys got it! If you have sibling rivalry between younger children.  Take them.",1195430400,4,494,4.373626373626373
3024335,5,B000YABV7W,"This creative movie is a delight to watch. A new idea is developed into a film that concludes with warmth, heart, and wholesome moral values. Vince Vaughn, Paul Giamatti, Kathy Bates, and Kevin Spacey are excellent, and their talents are well utilized. The movie is funny and enjoyable throughout, with a loving yuletide spirit at the end that is truly moving. Of course suspension of disbelief is required, but so it is in most children's movies. My ten-year-old grandson loved it as did his grandfather and I. It is rightfully billed as this season's holiday classic.",1195344000,4,569,4.9375
3024336,1,B000YABV7W,"Fred Claus (Vince Vaughn) is tired of being in his younger brother's shadow.  It doesn't help that his brother is Santa Claus (Paul Giammati), or that his mother (Kathy Baker) always comments that she wishes he were  more like Santa. In order to get out of jail and buy into a night club, he has to help his brother out for the holidays. Making matters tense is an efficiency expert (Kevin Spacey) with a heart two sizes too small out to ensure that the North Pole is shut down.

Sounds like it might be entertaining. Sadly, it's not. About the funniest scene is the sight gag when Fred tries to fit into an elf-sized bed. Then the viewer realizes that this same thing was done much more imaginatively by Vaughn's sometimes co-star Jon Favreau when he directed ""Elf.""

Arguably the worst movie I have seen this year - no make that this decade - it truly amazes me that crud like this can not only get green lighted, but actually attract some top stars. This unfunny Elf knock-off is just a huge waste of time. Hard to believe it was directed by the guy that brought the far funnier ""Wedding Crashers"" to the multiplex.",1194825600,6,1118,4.465686274509804
3024337,5,B000YABV7W,"""Fred Claus"" is great! The cast led by Vince Vaughn (as Fred Claus) and Paul Giamatti (as Santa Claus) is great.

The costume design by Anna Sheppard (who also did the costume design to ""Shanghai Knights"" & ""Hannibal Rising"" (2007) is great.

3024338,2,B000YABV7W,"Fred Claus (Vince Vaughn) has a big problem in his life: his brother is Santa Claus (Paul Giamatti), and took away all his attention. Now he's a bitter middle-aged repo man with an exasperated girlfriend (Rachel Weisz) who's looking to nab an OTB site. However, it's worth alot of cash, so he's now forced to work for his brother at his workshop, which as elves in love (John Michael Higgins) or good with records (Ludacris). But an oily efficients expert (Kevin Spacey) is dead-set on shutting down the workshop and moving Santa and the elves to the South Pole.

So, let me get this straight. David Dobkin, the man who scored big with 2005's summer raunch comedy revival, ""Wedding Crashers"", is now getting his feet wet with a Christmas comedy for the whole family? Don't get me wrong, some films of this genre manage to be success stories, including ""A Christmas Story"" and, more recently, ""Elf"", which starred Vince Vaughn's Brat Pack cohort Will Ferrell. And Dobkin had an opportunity to make a rascally wacky comedy with Christmas as a backdrop, thus hopefully ending ""Bad Santa""'s reign as the king of ripping Chrismas apart. Isn't that what the teaser trailer a while back proved?

Sadly, that promise wasn't kept. The man who had Vince Vaughn tied up while Isla Fisher raped him seems to have been raped himself. Now he's made a family comedy that Tim Allen wouldn't dare star in anymore (at least Allen's signed up for more adult-oriented fare). The whole gimmick of this film was that Santa had a cynical brother (which Vaughn could bring to life just like that), and he would be a fish out of water in the North Pole, mixing it up with elves (which actually managed to sneak in there) and Kevin Spacey (who I'll get to shortly). But Dobkin somehow gave in to consumer demands, and now he's made a film short on comedy and high on pathos.

Because Dobkin's doing a holiday family comedy, here's just what he's done: cartoon sound effects in the beginning, treating Clyde's obsession with Superman's cape seriously instead of having fun with it, playing ""Silent Night"" during a very dramatic scene (Dobkin really screws it up here), a sappy side story with a kid that Fred is friends with, and giving St. Nick a back injury which looks like a scene from the only Adam Sandler movie I ever skipped (""Click""). This is from the guy who gave us ""Wedding Crashers"", people.

It's a shame, because there are some scenes that actually worked. There's a nice subplot involving an elf and one of Santa's little helpers (Elizabeth Banks) that can be relatable to anybody who feels indifferent to another person. And Rachel Weisz maintains quite a bit of decency as Fred's exasperated girlfriend, who at least throws in some intelligence in a throwaway role (she deserves a gold medal for achieving that). Of course, some other potentially good ideas - including Ludacris as an elf DJ - aren't emphasized enough, just as long as Dobkin can try and squeeze a teardrop from our eyes.

A shame, because the performances across the board are actually watchable. Vaughn, even though he's stuck in PG land, gives it his all and makes a likeable loser out of Fred, though he gets more screen time than Paul Giamatti (who's billed second, but hardly appears through the effort). And I've already mentioned the nice work from the side cast, so that's that.

The film ends with a Christmas jingle from Ludacris, which further indicates what ""Fred Claus"" could've been: ""Wedding Crashers"" with snow. Instead, it's slowly turning Vaughn into a Tim Allen surrogate, rather than giving him the breathing room to enjoy the environment. Maybe his highly-reported romance with Jennifer Aniston put a dent on his career, and with a film co-starring the formerly-lovable-but-now-media-ho' Reese Witherspoon, ""Four Christmas"", he could become nothing more than just fodder for Perez Hilton's loser followers.

And that's just heartbreaking...",1194566400,16,3920,4.885714285714286
3024359,4,B000YABV7W,"Surprisingly, Santa Claus has a brother, Fred. He is not a happy man and always getting himself into trouble. This stemmed from his life-long resentment for his brother, Nick (Santa Claus). When Fred got into a really big predicament, Nicholas bailed him out (literally). To pay off the debt, Nick has Fred come to the North Pole to make toys. Things had been rough up there so Nick needed the help anyway. This was working out but Nick had to watch Fred constantly because he was always making a mess of things.

Nick had his hands full trying to keep production up and his brother out of trouble but that was nothing compared to the efficiency expert who wanted to shut down the North Pole if production didn't meet regulation standards. Fred had always felt second-best to his brother so he messes up production any way he can as a way to give his brother some grief.

I really liked this movie but I wouldnt recommend it for young children. I loved the way the North Pole was portrayed. The special effects were excellent. The North Pole never looked better.

In short, this is a fun Christmas movie with some funny and not so funny parts.",1518652800,,1143,4.538834951456311

3024391,4,B000YABV7W,"Very unusual, star-studded cast in this take on sibling rivalry. The ultimate sibling Mom and Dad love More turns out to be none other than Saint Nicholas himself, played by Paul Giamatti. His resentful brother (played by Vince Vaughan) grows up in his shadow and his life turns out to be one of flim-flamming, get-rich-quick-schemes, and flattery. This movie was good-hearted and quite funny, especially the scene where Vince Vaughan's character visits a support group for the non-famous brothers of celebrities. I feel the filmmaker wanted to do more with that scene but it was cut shorter because it took the film off into a different tangent, as funny as it was.",1515024000,,666,4.955357142857143

3024394,3,B000YABV7W,"Really enjoyed Elf with Will Ferrell and since Vaughn is a lot of similar (and a few the same) movies I had hoped Fred Claus would be as good.  It starts off pretty good with Vaughn, brother of Santa, as a repo man.  After a little girl kicks him for repossessing a big screen TV in her room, he gives her a clever rebuttal spiel of how her life will be better off without TV. However we never return to the repo world after this, so a lot of opportunities for laughs were missed with that omission.  The parking inspector lady girlfriend moments of disappointment for her were good, and the Salvation Army Santas chase to beat him up for encroaching on their territory was superb. But them movie  actually loses some of it's magic when it gets to the North Pole which is when it should have really become awesome.  The whole Kevin Spacey character thing was predictable and took up too much of the North Pole scenes time.  We could have had Fred stuffing up and then saving Christmas without that.  The fact Mrs Claus hates him, like a lot of wives do their husband's brothers was underutilized. A few more toy factory scenes, more brotherly arguments/fights and family tension would have made the film better . As I said we've seen the bureaucrat who hates Christmas trying to bring an end to it countless times before, we knew how that would go and it really wasn't that interesting.  The brothers of famous siblings anonymous help group thing was awesome though.  Elizabeth's Banks' character was underutilized.

The film has great moments, but a lot of filler especially at the North Pole, which as I said should have been just non stop awesome fun with the actors involved.",1514764800,,1679,4.585284280936455

Vince Vaughn plays it over the top, as usual I guess, and it gets a bit wearing the 3rd or 4th time around.  But some of the best lines of the movie aren't his, and so I still find fun to watch on occasion.

But this is the first Christmas movie that I can recall that introduces the idea that Santa has a family and extended family at that.  Plus the movie does not play down to silly stupid in the second half as a number of other Santa movies I could name do.  So for the notion of Santa having a family, this is one I wanted for my granddaughter to see.",1453766400,,655,3.887218045112782

I thought it was a great concept for a Christmas movie because you never really think of Santa as having siblings...our family outside of the elves and Mrs. Clause for that matter. I thought this movie would be great for everyone of all ages as there really weren't any parts that were inappropriate for kids. I love that Vince Vaughn was cast in this movie as he's one of my favorite across and he plays a very funny part. I would watch this movie over and over again!

The funny moments were too few and far between and it of course included a healthy dose of predictability and Christmas movie clich.  I'm not really sure who this movie is for; it does not seem to target kids, as kids are barely featured in it. It is not interesting enough or funny enough for adults. Zero replay-ability. Watch something from the Santa Clause series and Jingle all the way again instead of watching this once.",1450742400,,511,4.666666666666667

3024693,5,B000YABV7W,"I have a few ""favorite"" Christmas time movies, and this is one of them.  I have finally broken down and purchased the DVD.  The movie is touching, as you see the Claus family interact, and how perceived trauma's of childhood can carry to adulthood (Vince and Kevin).  Vince Vaughn is a master at these types of movies.  Just look at his body of work.  I consider him a younger Rob Reiner.  And, if you need more incentive, in addition to Vince Vaughn, look at the cast!  Paul Giamatti, Kevin Spacey, Rachel Weisz, John Higgins and Kathy Bates, (just to name a few).  How can it miss?  All I can say is, sit back with your bowl of popcorn, and enjoy the movie.  You won't be disappointed.

This is an update to my review.  Although this is still one of my favorite movies, when I played it the other night, I found it was damaged.  I carefully wiped it down, but it still had ""errors"".  The movie was sealed, and was not used.  I did not contact Amazon or the seller, since it was going to be more trouble than it was worth to return it.  Hope others have a better experience.",1449100800,2,1075,4.27363184079602

I have had it on my phone for around 2 months and it's easy to keep clean and you can't even tell it has a screen protector on it. This is the BEST screen protector you will ever put on your phone.

Not only is the plot ludicrous and downright idiotic, but it's just anti-Xmas.  Xmas and believing in Santa (for children) is about magic.  This movie tries to be so hip with even making xmas and easter, etc. corporate and modern, that it totally ruins the whole concept of the holidays.  Please, if you must watch this vomitous crap, as an adult, be kind enough to not show it to your kids.

The casting of Paul Giamatti was a bit of an odd choice for Santa Claus, not that I don't like him - he just Doesn't seem right as St. Nick somehow.  Vince Vaughan does his fast-talking used car salesman routine that he does so well (and so often).  But it's a good story and the ending features a montage of  kids opening their presents that will bring a tear to the eye of any parent who has happy memories of their own little ones tearing into the packages on Christmas day.  I'm glad I made the upgrade to Blu-Ray - the picture and sound quality was a noticable improvement over the DVD.",1390953600,,682,4.338582677165355

Kids will like Santa, the elves, Christmas Town, flying reindeer, magic sleigh, etc.  - all portrayed in glowing magical special effects beauty.  Santa's Little Helper (Elizabeth Banks) is particularly distracting in her jolly outfit.  Why was she regular sized?  So many questions.",1387756800,,406,5.7

3025011,4,B000YABV7W,"I wanted to add an inexpensive movie to our Christmas collection but didn't expect much.  We were very pleasantly surprised by the film and enjoyed the characters and situations, especially Paul Giamatti's somewhat depressed and run-down Santa, who's let the years get to him until his bad boy big brother shows up to take advantage of his little brother.  When Fred turns the North Pole upside down with his shenanigans, the Malevolent efficiency expert played by Kevin Spacey plots his own revenge on the hapless Santa Claus.

3025056,1,B000YABV7W,"The movie itself gets 5 stars. But the reason I gave 1 star is because I like to add my Digital Copies to my iPad and to iCloud when I buy Digital Copy combo packs. That was my sole reason for upgrading to the 3-disc Blu-Ray+Digital Copy combo pack of Fred Claus. This turned out to be a HUGE mistake because the Digital Copy disc WILL NOT READ in iTunes. It is a Windows Media Player Digital Copy ONLY despite the fact the outer sticker that says Bonus Digital Copy says it is compatible with iTunes. It is false advertising to say it is compatible with iTunes when the Digital Copy disc WILL NOT READ in iTunes.

If you are buying this for the Digital Copy, you will feel cheated.

If you really want an iTunes Digital Copy, you MUST buy the movie from iTunes in order to get it. There is no free iTunes Digital Copy for this movie at all.

If you still want to get the Blu-Ray, it would be best if you buy the 1-disc version because ALL copies of that 3-disc Fred Claus ONLY HAVE Windows Media Player Digital Copy.",1365292800,,1017,4.205128205128205

3025058,3,B000YABV7W,"I purchased this for my son who had seen it several times and enjoyed it.  Though it may be aimed at a young audience or those with a certain sense of humor, I thought this was a creative and comical story with some touching moments.
Fred being the brother of Santa Claus, it hasn't been an easy adjustment.  According to this story, once one in a family becomes immortal, the whole family becomes immortal.  Fred tries to blend into normal society, but doesn't do it well.  Most of the time he's a con artist, trying to make it in the real world, but often getting into trouble.  When his brother Santa, decides to bail him out of jail, he requires Fred to pay him back by working at the north pole.  Though Fred has issues, especially feeling he is the lessor son, who can never live up to Santa, he also has a good heart.  When a proficiency analyzer is sent to the North Pole to check out the operation, with the possibility of shutting it down, it's Fred whose efforts change the situation from hopeless to hopeful.",1361577600,,1020,4.3936170212765955

This will forever be a part of our family's holiday traditions, along with ""Elf,"" ""A Christmas Story,"" and ""Rudolf the Red-Nosed Reindeer."" How is it though, that when Fred and his younger brother Santa are frozen in age, as is conveniently explained in a voice-over, Santa looks about thirty years older than Fred?

My favorite scene is when Vince shows up at his girfriend's window trying to explain himself and she is sick of his lies.  She tells him that she is through with the relationship and his response is, I'm not.  She tells him that she can't take it anymore and his response is that he can take it still.

In fact, I've watched it so many times that I bought the Blu-Ray for fear that the DVD will wear out, however I saw no difference between the two, and the blu-ray stalled so I sent it back.

You can get the description elsewhere, but I find this movie to be a ""feel good"" with wonderful actors.  How can you possibly go wrong with Vince Vaughn, Paul Giamatti, and John Michael Higgins?

It was nice to see how Fred turned out after he realized how ""special"" Nick was and the obvious favortism their mother showed. It had that predictable happy ending but it's a Christmas movie, you have to get that.  What was good to look at was how they made the elves look in size.  I thought it was a nice job.

Sibling rivalry, modernization and over commericalization, greed, and the retreat from the true meaning of Christmas are just a few of the themes that would make for great family viewing and discussion. Plenty of laughs and quite a few poignant, heartfelt moments help Vince, Paul, and a great supporting cast masterfully capture the fun in dysfunctional family holidays. Even Santa Claus' Christmas isn't all snowflakes and candy canes. A great departure from the myth that holiday magic comes from stores and boxes.",1349308800,,615,5.285714285714286

Multiply the effects of that poor transfer by viewing it on a 60 inch 1080P plasma tv and you'll see the grainy images in all their glory.  The color is great, but the grainy images ruin what could have been a great Blu-Ray.",1328054400,,454,4.580246913580247
3025177,2,B000YABV7W,"This movie had a great idea, that Santa Claus has an older brother forced to live in his shadow, but blew it in the end.

The first big problem was the Kevin Spacey as the efficiency expert wanting to shut down Santa's operation. Acting wise, I thought Kevin Spacey did a fine job in the role, but plot wise, WHY IS THERE AN EFFICIENCY EXPERT THERE AT ALL?

This isn't the ""Santa Clause"", where Santa is a job more than a person. Santa runs the show here. Who are these people that Santa is supposed to answer to and why?

The second big is the whole naughty/nice issue. The whole naughty/nice concept is to teach children that there are rewards and consequences associated with good and bad behavior. But in this movie, the reason given is NOT that naughty children who still get a present won't learn their lesson and change their ways, but that Santa is just not able to make and deliver enough toys for everyone. It's all about taking some of the load off himself.

The third biggie is the end, where Fred visits his girlfriend in her bedroom and declares, not his love, not that he wished to marry her - giving her a ring for her Christmas present, but that he has ALREADY moved into her apartment. That was just downright creepy.",1325808000,,1235,4.427312775330397
3025178,1,B000YABV7W,There's no way anyone could give this film a good review. Someone at Warner Bros is trying to recoup their investment by planting phony 5 star reviews on Amazon.

3025179,5,B000YABV7W,I loved this movie when I first saw it and I enjoy watching it over and over at the holiday times. Both Vince Vaughn and Paul Giamatti give great performances in their respective roles. Even Kevin Spacey is fantastic. It is a great story about a family and how siblings have their differences but can in the most needed times help each other out.  It also has a great message about forgiving people who make mistakes and letting the ones important to you know how much you love them.,1325462400,,483,4.426966292134831
3025180,1,B000YABV7W,"This review is solely on the seller currently listed for this item, Mirmedia fulfilled by Amazon.  The Blu-ray I received had the following issues which made for an automatic return.  Barcode on outside was purposefully defaced with what looks like a razor blade.  They cut through the outside plastic cover and across the barcode.  Second, the clips to hold the disc trays inside the case were broken.  This meant the Bluray disc and Digital Copy Disc were just rattling around inside the case and any time you open the case you would need to prepare for these discs to immediately fall out.  Apparently the seller is rated high... so maybe this was just one mishap... but be careful when your order is fulfilled by these guys.

12/28: Update: Well I ordered a replacement for the above noted blu-ray from another ""Fulfilled by Amazon"" vendor called 'Best Deals FBA' on the website and 'Something Special LLC' on the invoice and packing slip.  This copy was almost or just as worse as the one noted above.  This one came... with 'NO' shrink wrapping... only the typical Blu-Ray Sticker on top of the case.  Also on the spine side of the case were actual holes on the top and bottom of the side.  After, seeing this I did not even bother to take the sticker off.

It seems strange that both copies of this movie appear to have been intentionally defaced by either the seller or their supplier. But, if that is what you are going to receive... they should at least note... ""You will receive a blu-ray with a busted up case"" instead of labeling it as 'new'.

Also, any illusions I had that Amazon would enforce some type of quality control, when it's a seller labeled as ""Fulfilled by Amazon"" have totally gone up in smoke.  At least they are good enough refunding... but going through the return hassle twice for the same product... that's a bit annoying.  From now on.. I am sticking to sold by Amazon only for blu-rays.",1324339200,,1920,4.605882352941176

3025186,3,B000YABV7W,"This movie really had it's ups and downs.  I thought the acting was spectacular.  Paul Giamatti was a wonderful choice for Santa.  He was so sincere, and his voice is perfect for what I think Santa would sound like.  Vince Vaughn is great.  He's really good at playing that brother who is generally a schmuck, but has a couple redeeming qualities to bring you back in.  Kevin Spacey did a great job with the ""bad guy"" role, and he's such a chameleon that you almost forget it's him.  The person that stole the show, for me, was Bobb'e Thompson who plays ""Slam.""  This kid is so funny and so good you forget he's a kid.

Here's the bad part:  The story line.  Fred is a down-and-out guy who has one more scheme to make him rich, so he calls on his brother Santa.  Of course, Santa has that tug-at-your-heartstrings reaction that makes him want to help Fred, but we all know he shouldn't.  Clyde (Kevin Spacey) is sent to ""review"" the operation with the intention of shutting it down.  Fred is put to work to earn his ""gift"" from Santa, and it puts the factory in jeopardy.

I found the movie to be funny, with spectacular acting and set design.  However, the over riding theme of codependancy was sometimes a little too much to stomach.  There were times during the movie I found myself really hating Fred, and think Santa to be too big of an idiot, that I couldn't enjoy what was happening.  But because there were other really funny moments, I couldn't give this movie too bad of a review.",1312761600,,1490,4.415441176470588

It's Christmas movie! Where was the joy? Where was the love? Not everything needs to be Elf or It's A Wonderful Life but no matter which kind of movie a holiday flick is, it has to be good such as Bad Santa. Not a family film but good. This film does have an awesome soundtrack so I will recommend that.",1303257600,,479,4.393258426966292
3025188,3,B000YABV7W,"`Fred Claus' is one of those Christmas films that surprises you by being better than you expected. This follows Fred Claus, who is Santa's older, jaded brother, who has to help save Christmas when Santa injures himself. There is family history and some animosity between them, but this is put aside in the name of Christmas.

Vaughn has some funny lines and really makes this film with his comedic acting and Giamatti plays Santa very well indeed. The rest of the cast is pretty good as well and this film manages to be heart warming, without being schmaltzy; which is rare for a Hollywood film these days.

This is easy going, not too taxing, has a reasonable storyline and makes for an entertaining couple of hours viewing for all the family. Exactly what you would wish for in a Christmas film.

resolve things and help a few other people along the way. The little boy that goes into foster care and then is adopted is wonderful (more people should be foster/adoptive parents).  Anyway, when Fred looses control toward DJ Donnie and changes the music to an Elvis song....well, I laugh so hard that I can not see straight.  Vince is dancing on the table and the elves are having a blast.....It is a great show.  I would say that it is for children over 10 but my 5 year old loves the ""Elivs"" part so much that we replay that section a lot.....all through out the year.  This is a great movie!!! There is one scene where there is a group of ""unhappy siblings"" in a group session. There is Clinton, Stalone, Baldwin and more but I have to say that
Bill Clinton's brother steals that scene. Fred calls it like he sees it and then when he sees things differently....well, he calls it differently...I hope that make sense.  I do not want to give it all away. It is a great movie. We watch it at least once a month.",1293667200,,1247,4.299145299145299

With a great supporting cast around him, the jokes are never far from the screen and the fun is always following.  Paul Giamatti deserves a lot of credit for playing this whole straight and down the center. The laughs santa gets are usually because Fred is acting a certain selfish way.

The movie is absolutely hilarious in places, yet provides many tender moments. This really is well worth purchasing and watching. It has a lot of modern jokes but nothing dirty or too adult (which seems hard to find nowadays, even at Christmas). I think adults will identify with the material more than kids since it reflects on the experience of growing from childhood to adulthood in the shadow of a more-favored sibling. This will become a Christmas classic for those us us born after 1950.

Kudos to the folks who brought us a modern take on Santa and how it would be to be related to him, in good ways and challenging ones. Do yourself a favor and see this movie.",1287964800,,918,4.394117647058824

Over Mrs. Claus' objections, Nicholas agrees to help his brother on one condition: that he come to the North Pole and earn the money he needs by working in Santa's Toy Shop. The trouble is that Fred isn't exactly elf material and, with Christmas fast approaching, Fred could jeopardize the jolliest holiday of the year.

It's well cast and well acted--Vince Vaughn, Paul Giamatti, Kevin Spacey, John Michael Higgins, Kathy Bates, et. al. It has a modern sensibility and turns dark (and slows down) in the middle, but resolves nicely in a touching finale with a good (and surprisingly realistic) message. I think the special effects--especially on a small screen--look good. The story stretches credulity but it's a fairytale, after all. Don't get hung up on it. Directed by same guy that directed ""Wedding Crashers,"" and he knows comedy. I think it's certainly as good as ""Christmas Vacation"" which has become a Christmas staple.",1260748800,,735,4.888

I thought perhaps there would be a video setting I could change, but not matter what is changed on the player, it is the same black bar top and bottom.  This is the last time I buy a Blu-Ray movie from Amazon because I will have no way to tell what aspect I am getting.

3025227,4,B000YABV7W,"A wonderful feel-good Christmas movie, Fred Clause, brings to the screen the story of Santa Clause's older brother whose life took a turn toward naughtiness following the birth of the sibling who the world will refer to as St. Nicholas.
Fred Clause is a film about Christmas, human relations, hope and second chances as well as trust, love, and inner strength.
Vince Vaughn, Paul Giamatti, Kevin Spacey, Elizabeth Banks (who is GORGEOUS!) and the rest of the cast, have done an excellent job with their performances, though Rachel Weisz seems out of place in this movie, i.e. an Englishwoman handing out traffic violation tickets in Chicago is rather unlikely. Nevertheless, the setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all very good!
Though not a masterpiece, Fred Clause is a movie definitely worth watching as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment!",1259539200,,889,5.095890410958904
3025228,1,B000YABV7W,"After watching this movie I realized I had not laughed once, and that's rare for me.  There are other 'modern' Christmas movies that carry off the sarcastic side of Christmas without letting cynicism sink it to this kind of low.  Kevin Spacey, a phenomenal actor, was given a banal bit part which he tried his best to carry off, that of an efficiency expert who carries Santa's ""pink slip"" in his pocket.  Paul Giamatti and Vince Vaughn played it very convincingly, but the creative talents of Rachel Weisz and Miranda Richardson had no place in which to shine.  The ending did nothing to lift spirits, and it was frankly weird when at the end Fred and Nick's mother implies that her own son (Fred) is a little outclassed by his love interest, who plays a meter maid (Rachel Weisz).  What kind of mother says that about her own son (even in real life), especially after he just saves Christmas?",1259280000,2,894,4.59748427672956

The previews contained all the funny parts so it left the movie pretty dull. Definitely not a heartwarming, get in the Christmas spirit kind of movie.  Ho, Ho, Ho, Hum!",1259020800,,407,4.259740259740259

3025231,4,B000YABV7W,"I really, REALLY enjoyed this movie, which tells the story of Fred Claus (Vince Vaughn), the disenchanted older brother of St. Nicholas, a.k.a. Santa (Paul Giamatti). Fred is everything Santa is not: irresponsible, bitter, and kind of shady. However, when Santa agrees to give Fred $50,000 in exchange for helping out at the North Pole right before Christmas, Fred catches the next sleigh ride over, and hilarity ensues.

This movie is fantastically funny, mainly because of Vaughn. His character's complete disdain for all things Christmas is hilarious, from the exasperated facial expressions to the snarky one-liners. The supporting cast is wonderful as well, especially Kevin Spacey, a vindictive member of an overseeing committee that is threatening to shut Santa's operation down. Also, there's a fantastic scene where Fred attends a Siblings Anonymous meeting. I don't want to spoil it, but watch for a few cameos and get ready for a lot of laughs.

The one negative aspect of the film: Rachel Weisz, who in my opinion is one of the most annoying actresses alive. The good news in that she's not in the film very much, and even when she is on screen, Vaughn's performance is so good that he kept me laughing and made me forget how much I want to slap that chick.

Overall, ""Fred Claus"" is a smart holiday farce that is definitely worth watching. I'm going to make this movie an annual Christmas tradition at my house.",1257811200,,1424,4.9004149377593365
3025242,4,B000YABV7W,"I had avoided watching this, thinking it would be a silly story much like the various Santa Claus movies, but after finally watching it I found it to be a delightful, comical and moving tribute to things that matter most.  Sibling rivalry and how to love ourselves and not compare or be compared to our peers, how life is full of surprises and often we can rise above our limitations and challenge ourselves, and holding charity in our heart...that everyone has struggles and should be forgiven and accepted. Everyone has a little bit of naughty and nice in them, but everyone deserves a break, or in this case, a Christmas present.  That sounds deep, and the message is, but toss in gorgeous settings, a wonderful back story, beautiful score, an excellent cast and lots of laughter between the happy tears that stream down your face, and you have a fabulous Christmas special, especially for adults who may have lost their own zest for the holiday season.  Very enjoyable and highly recommended!",1248480000,,996,4.812865497076023
3025243,5,B000YABV7W,"My 5 year old loves this film! It's the first live action film he has ever been able to sit through without being bored, so I knew it was a must have for us!

3025244,2,B000YABV7W,"With a cast this good, its amazing that this film is so bad! The first two thirds of the film are so depressing that I almost couldn't imagine watching this in the holiday season. Of course the ending is predicatable and uplifting, but the journey there is rather dull. It's just too little, too late.

The film is over loaded with special effects and not much else. It's not dark enough to be a black comedy and it's not sentimental enough to give you that classic holiday feeling. HO HO Hummmmmm!",1243036800,,498,4.472527472527473
3025245,3,B000YABV7W,"It's an interesting premise:  If Saint Nick had an older brother, what kind of sibling rivalry would there be?  Well, we find out in the whimsical, yet still unexciting, FRED CLAUS.  It looks like older bro Fred (Vince Vaughn, who goes through the motions, and nothing more) resents his kid sibling Nicholas because Nicholas is just so. . .good.  So Fred rebels, and while Nicholas becomes a saint endeared to the entire world his brother is a disgruntled outcast with relationship issues (why is Rachel Weisz in this movie?).  Of course, this conflict develops over centuries and centuries, because Santa Claus is immortal, therefore everyone in his family--even those who marry into it--becomes immortal.

Isn't that special?

It's impossible for Paul Giamatti to turn in a stinker, so he's admirable as a stressed-out Santa reaching out to his brother due to a Yuletide crisis.  The interaction with Vaughn is one-sided, as Giamatti puts in some effort--Vaughn coasts.  Kevin Spacey is the villain, yet the viewer never really understands why.  And the beautiful, luscious Elizabeth Banks is utterly, completely wasted in her role as a North Pole bean counter.

One scene, which I immensely enjoyed, saved good ol' FRED CLAUS from two-star status, and that was a Siblings Anonymous meeting, featuring a contrite Roger Clinton and an angry Stephen Baldwin.  It was funny, it was entertaining, it was witty, it was engaging--but one scene does not make a movie good.  Case in point:  FRED CLAUS.

3025246,1,B000YABV7W,"The lead actor is one-note Vince Vaughn, so unless you are a fan of that type you are in for a disappointment.  Also, many excellent actors are wasted in this, especially the glorious Miranda Richardson.  When you add Rachel Weiz as a supporting player and Kevin Spacey as the requisite bad guy (I could never figure out the organization he worked for where Santa was a mere employee) as well as Kathy Bates as Mom Claus, obviously the idea of this movie appealed to the players and they couldn't have known the end result.  By the way, for those interested, Gerard Butler is in a cameo.  I wondered why he was in there at all.  But overall this movie was bits and pieces and unexplained bits (including the human-sized lady elf who showcases her bosom).

The film opens surprisingly well with an inventive backstory for Nicholas Claus.  Unfortunately once you venture out of the fairy-tale realm you have a collision with the Santa mystique - complete with flying reindeer - and a brother in a metropolis who is going to a siblings anonymous meeting attended by other brothers with problems featuring cameos by Frank Stallone, one of the Baldwins (I'm not sure which one) and Roger Clinton.  Again, it probably read well on paper but in execution it is an utter mess.

This is the most unfunny comedy I have ever seen.  Instead of abandoning it completely, I suffered through it in small doses.

If you want an excellent Santa film to see, the one to stick with is the series by Tim Allen, THE SANTA CLAUS etc. Nowhere does it collide with the Santa myth but works with it and adds to the magic.",1242691200,2,1596,4.564912280701755

3025297,5,B000YABV7W,"FRED CLAUS

Since it is the month of December it was a no brainier that I would have to get into some holiday films. I decided I would start this out with a new release from this month in the form of ""Fred Claus"", which is a really good film despite being a PG rated film [took me by surprise]. Don't get me wrong there are a lot of good PG rated films out there but one starring Vince Vaughn just seems weird at first. I bring that up because some reviews I have read say that Vince's performance was bad, mainly because he wasn't in R-Rated mode. I also wanted to do this one because I just went to see Vince's new film which is also a Christmas film, ""Four Christmases"" which was a really funny film.

On that note I must say that I really enjoyed this film although to be honest I knew I would because of the cast. It turns out that we really did not know everything about Santa after all, sure all the myths were true but we never knew about his big brother Fred. It seems that Fred is the exact opposite of his little bro and is actually a bitter person holding a lot of animosity towards Saint Nick. So after a not so good childhood between the two they go their separate ways and well you know what became of Nick, Fred on the other hand ended up quite different. If Santa is a giver [at least once a year] Fred is a taker, literally, he is a repo man. Fred is an unhappy man who only has one friend in a little kid named Sam, and a shaky relationship with his girlfriend Wanda. One day he gets into a little mishap with a gang of Santa's and ends up behind bars; it is here that he makes a deal with his brother about posting bail and also giving him a lot of cash. The deal is in order to get the cash he needs Fred must agree to come to the North Pole to visit his family and work for the cash at Santa's Shop.

The film really picks up here as not only is the family getting into it with each other but they are doing it in front of Clyde Northcut, a man who is there to shut Santa's operation down. So naturally Fred's being there only adds to the problems, especially since they are on a three strike rule by Clyde. I have to say that writers Jessie Nelson and Dan Fogelman have crafted a really heartfelt, warm and funny film that is much better then it gets credit for, come on any film with some ""ninja action"" secret service Elves is good in my book. These two along with director David Dobkin [who provides a good commentary for the film] have really done a good job of not only adding in and sticking to the mythos of Santa Claus but also making this film feel real up to date. Take for instance a scene were the family Claus call an intervention for the black sheep trouble child Fred, what other film has done that?

As far as the actors go everyone does an outstanding job and really make their characters seem real. Vince Vaughn [who co-produced this film along side 4 other producers one of which is Joel Silver] as usual shines as the troubled yet quick thinker who while bad will find his way to the light, his character really is a smart guy. He is a jerk but at the same time he is really a kind hearted guy, and Vaughn brings his character to life. Paul Giamatti is nothing short of brilliant as Nick Claus, he brings a lot of emotion to the character. You can see the stress he is under from Clyde come through in his face and you can see the pain in his eyes about how he feels about his relationship with his brother. Kevin Spacey is great as Clyde who is there to end Christmas, his scene with Vince about chopping down the bigger tree is brilliant and he truly is Superman [just watch the movie]. John Michael Higgins as Willie the head elf shines as Vince's best bud up at the pole, and Bobb'e J. Thompson as Sam is really good as is Ludacris as the Elf DJ, and Trevor Peacock is great not only as Papa Claus but also as the narrator.

But this film would not have been as good if the ladies were not up to par, and they all do wonderful jobs. My favorite actress of all time Kathy Bates is great as Mama Claus who just can't seem to treat her oldest as well as her youngest. Her tension with Nick's wife is really played well, and both actresses do great jobs. Speaking of Nick Claus's wife, Miranda Richardson plays Annette Claus wonderfully and her scenes laying it onto Fred for being a screw up are great. Elizabeth Banks plays Charlene who is Willie's love interest and she does a great job, Rachel Weisz does a great job as well playing Wanda Fred's girlfriend.

I would say that this is really a good film, just go into it wanted to have a good time and you will. Maybe I liked this film so much because it is the first Christmas related film I have watched this month or maybe it is because of the significance of this month. It may be because for the first time in years I sat down and watched a movie with my mom, step dad [both came down from Maryland], brother, sister [who came down with them two], grandparents, Aunt, Uncle, 2 year old cousin and my girl that I liked it so much, either way I was really entertained. I recommend this film to everyone reading this, especially during this month. It may not be the greatest Christmas movie ever but it was still very enjoyable. Kids will defiantly like it and adults should to, it is a great story full of out there, likeable, endearing characters.

But from the very beginning when they showed the boys together from the time Santa was born, I was hooked!  They actually did some development of the characters, relationships, and why people sometimes turn out the way they turn out to be due to adversity, misunderstandings, etc.  There were funny moments and demonstrations of true unconditional love.  Even the character who was not the ""sainted"" Santa, Santa's brother Fred, was able to deliver an important lesson to Santa and make Santa realize the error of his ways, which is EVERY CHILD DESERVES A PRESENT AT CHRISTMAS, there are really no ""bad"" children, just children who have done bad things because they haven't received enough love.  The North Pole Santa's workshop, etc. scenes also looked completely professional, as good as the ""Santa Clause"" series of movies.  Excellent special effects, looked like they spared no expense here.  I know why it's rated PG but since Santa doesn't look like your typical cutesy jolly soul, and since the messages are a little bit mature, I wouldn't recommend watching it with your 3 year old.

3025300,4,B000YABV7W,"I passed on this movie last year because it got poor reviews. I was looking through Amazon's selection of holiday movies this year, just because we felt like watching something different from our collection of favorites and classics. I chose this.

I looked quickly through the reviews here and many said that it was simply terrible, but some said it was okay. I am neither a huge fan or a hater of Vince Vaughn so I wondered if I would like him in this (as he has annoyed me in some movies.) I took a chance with it and my family actually watched it 3 evenings in a row. It isn't some wonderful classic that is earth-shattering in it's brilliance, but it is definitely watchable and often funny or touching. Vaughn is very good as Santa's brother and plays his snarky role with what seems like relish! Giamatti is very good as Santa and his ""straight"" type humor is effective. I have no idea what Elizabeth Banks purpose is in the movie really, but it doesn't take too much away from the story. Kevin Spacey plays a believable ""jerk."" John Michael Higgins is Head Elf, (I just loved him in ""Best In Show"") and the camera work to make him look much smaller than Vaughn is very effective. The main story itself is fine, but the other characters' stories are sort of loosely stuck in.

Overall, I think the movie is at least worth watching and even owning. We do have favorites that we like better than this, but it has some really great and funny moments that make me not regret buying it. It is a nice addition to our collection of holiday movies even if it doesn't end up being on the top of our ""favorites"" list! Don't buy it expecting Dickens, (or even ""Elf"") but it is fine for a runner-up!",1229212800,,1694,4.39171974522293
3025301,2,B000YABV7W,"How can a ""better than expected"" cast make such a mediocre Christmas film? Vince Vaughn plays....well...Vince Vaughn as Fred Claus the older brother of Paul Giamatti 's Nick Claus (older brother?!!?), the child that grows up to be ole Santa Claus himself. After off-screen Nick is Sainthooded and everyone related to him stops aging and even wives and parents will live forever (but forget about that point because a life of eternity is never mentioned again). Anywho, a couple of hundred years later Fred Claus is living as a loser in New York who due to his jealousy of his great brother, gets thrown in jail with a run-in of a few mall Santas, and as a last resort calls St. Nick to bail him out. But Santa wants something in return, and that's for his only brother to help out an over-worked North Pole by paying a visit. Ho, ho, oh-no! After a few mishaps with the elves, some of which have decided to take up Ninja-style defense training (you heard me), an efficiency expert shows up (wildly misused Kevin Spacey) and tries to shut down Santa's operation and outsource it to the South Pole. So, it's up to this Grinch of a brother to save the day, don the redsuit, and get the toys delivered on time.

What got me about this film is that I couldn't figure out who it's core audience was. Too satirical for kids, too bland for adults. While the effects were XMas-y enough, if you were to take out the A-list actors, this would have played perfectly on Lifetime or ABC Family starring Luke Perry. And as for the elf actors, two of which played by John Michael Higgins and rapper Ludacris, they used the CGI-the-face-over-the-little-person effect like in Little Man, but very scrooge-like in making it look real. And why did Rachel Weisz agree to be in this for just three scenes? I guess not doing that last Mummy movie got her on the naughty list.

So while the movie isn't a complete piece of coal, some scenes are slighly humourous like the Siblings Anonymous meeting Fred attends with other sufferers like Frank Stallone, Roger Clinton, and Stephen Baldwin. But at a tiring one hour and fifty-six minutes, this could have trimmed out more fruitcake and gave better presents. And if that wasn't bad enough, the one-disc's only bonus is twenty-five MORE minutes of deleted scenes?!!? Yipes, it's gonna actually BE Christmas by the time I finish this! So in conclusion, it's a decent rent for the holidays, but ask Santa for a better DVD to be placed in your stocking than this one because like most gifts you get this day, it will be forgotten by New Years.

Fred comes into his own and advocates for all children, not just the good ones and becomes the hero of the hour.

There was a scene that was really fun I liked where Fred has the elves play a song other than the one they always played and they all ensue in a very fun, creative dance that's very joyful and fun.

This time the responsibility falls on the shoulders of Santa's estranged brother, Fred (Vince Vaughn). Why anyone would attempt to follow in the boot prints of Tim Allen who played the part of the reluctant Santa to perfection in `The Santa Clause', `Santa Clause 2' and `The Santa Clause 3 - The Escape Clause' is beyond me. When you stop and think about it, the '07 film `Fred Claus' most resembles the third installment of the forementioned films which just so happens to be by far the worst of the three.

Having written the above you're probably expecting me to slam `Fred Claus' mercilessly. Well, not exactly. For all intents and purposes this movie had all the trappings of a major bomb waiting to explode, but miraculously that didn't happen. Despite the retread of old storylines the film manages to maintain the interest of the audience from beginning to end primarily to the credit of the always lovable Vince Vaughn. By playing the part of Fed Claus in a low key fashion he keeps things from coming off too ridiculous yet injects enough personality and humor to make the character and story work. Paul Giamatti delivers his usual strong performance, head elf Willie played by John Michael Higgins is immensely entertaining and the fetching Elizabeth Banks is enchanting as Santa's assistant. Add to the cast the talented Kevin Spacey, Rachel Weisz and Kathy Bates along with first rate production values and an upbeat soundtrack of recognizable tunes and you're good to go,

This movie was pretty much a monumental flop.  I don't know who they were trying to cater to in this movie -- kids, adults, or both.  It was kind of a jumbled mess, all the way throughout.  A few funny parts here and there, but nothing to write home about.

Vince Vaughn, I love him dearly, but he was off his game throughout the entire film.  Almost as if he didn't feel comfortable in the role, or comfortable on set, or something.  The entire movie, it just failed to click.  Every time I thought the film was picking up steam, it fell flat on its face again.

I'd give this movie 1 star, but I'm giving it an extra 1 star for the ending of the movie, which actually saved it.  I walked away from the movie thinking, ""Ok, wasn't the WORST movie ever, but wasn't too good.""  If it weren't for the ending, I might have called it the worst movie of 2007.  Harsh, but true.

3025333,3,B000YABV7W,"""Fred Claus"" desperately wants (and tries too hard) to be a modern Christmas movie classic in the tradition of ""Elf."" ""Fred Claus"" is actually the opposite of ""Elf."" Wheras Will Farrell's elf Buddy brought North Pole Magic with him into a world-weary New York City, in ""Fred"", several real-world problems come crashing down into the North Pole, nearly cancelling Christmas forever.
  All families are disfunctional (to varying degrees) and those disfunctions always seem to come out during the holiday season. Screenwriters Dan Fogelman and Jessie Nelson take this idea and run with it to the endth degree in ""Fred Claus."" Tired of living in the saintly shadow of his brother Nick-- A.K.A. Santa Claus, Fred (Vince Vaughn) is completely estranged from the Claus family. Living in Chicago, Fred is a repo-man. (What Santa Claus giveth, Fred taketh away). Eventually, Fred winds up in jail and brother Nick (Paul Giamatti) bails him out-- on the condition that Fred come for a visit to the North Pole. Fred arrives just as the North Pole and Christmas come under attack from Clyde Northcutt (Kevin Spacey), an ""efficientcy expert"" with grudges and an axe to grind. Kevin Spacey seems out of place, and rather uncomfortable, in this role.
  Your enjoyment (or lack thereof) of ""Fred Claus"" will depend on how you respond to the rascally, slightly smarmy, comedic persona of Vince Vaughn. The best scenes seem to be improvised by Vaughn on the spot. I particularly enjoyed the scene where Fred changes the music in the Elves' workshop from a cloyingly sweet and bland Doris Day to a rocking Elvis Presley. Vaughn races down the stairs saying to the Elves, ""Let's make some bad decisions together! "" Nick enters and sees Fred and the elves engaged in a rocking free for all and exclaims, ""ho, ho, holy crap!""
  Paul Giamatti is quite good as a very harried and stressed out St.  Nick. Parents may be a bit shocked when he tells Fred that Christmas has gone right ""down the crapper!"" Fred and Nick engage in a snowball fight. Then, a crazed Nick tries to run Fred over with a snowmobile! The Clauses, along with Nick's girlfriend (Rachel Weisz) attend a ""family therapy"" session; or ""intervention."" Back in Chicago, Fred attends a ""Brothers Anonymous"" meeting with  (in  funny cameos) Frank Stallone, Roger Clinton, and Stephen Baldwin! Stephen seems particularly angry with Alec. Nobody believes Fred when he says that his brother is Santa Claus, but Roger Clinton speaks the magic words that convince Fred that he must save the Claus family honor, as well as Christmas itself.
  The DVD includes both Widescreen and Full-Screen Versions of the film on one double-sided disc. Director David Dobkin offers an overly-effusive, self-congratulatory, ultimately boring,  Commentary Track. ""Fred Claus"" may not be ""Elf"" or ""Miracle On 34th Street"", but thankfully it is not crass or mean-spirited like ""Bad Santa.""

The most amusing theme is the sibling rivalry. Nicholas (Giamatti) is a saint of course, and Fred, well, he's the older and forgotten brother, which requires a few laugh-out-loud counseling sessions.

Many scenes seemed out of place and contrived; the kind of ""funny notion"" scenes that are drug out WAY too far to where any sense of comedy is lost.

The director/producer tried to go ""tear jerker"" at the end, which would have been suitable if ANYTHING leading up that point had been worth following.

Ugh, major disappointment. I can see how some people might enjoy this OK, since many people will take any garbage they're fed, but I would strongly encourage waiting for DVD on this one. NOT worth the $23,978 it takes to get your family to the movies these days.",1217548800,7,895,4.478527607361963
3258830,4,B000YABV7W,"I read many reviews from both Amazon and other print sources and the overwhelming reaction to Fred Claus was one of disappointment and worse. This won't be the first nor last time I am glad I looked into something for myself instead of trusting others. I don't know if it is my own sordid, pathetic personal life history or what, but this movie touched me and I left the movie emotionally moved and struck by how something advertised as your typical holiday comedy fare (read: stupid and infantile) could have delivered such a blow to my heart.
Vince Vaughn, who is the Bill Murray of his generation, delivers an endearing performance, Paul Giamatti is, as always, brilliant, and the rest of the cast is very good. The plot is simple enough but the undercurrent of family relationships and how they can influence people throughout their life hit me hard. One last positive - the soundtrack is a wonderful mix of seasonal favorites old and new with the bonus of a haunting Silent Night by Sinead O'Connor (which just sent me over the teary edge) and the Over the Rainbow/Wonderful World medley by the Hawaiian singer whose name I can neither remember nor spell.
Fred Claus will not make you throw out It's A Wonderful Life or even Rudolph the Reindeer, but it is heartwarming and deserves to be judged before dismissed as yet another warmed over holiday leftover.",1195516800,81,1362,4.726890756302521

They talked about how Fred and Nicholas treated each other for two days after, and what was right and what was wrong.  It may not be a classic, but these two little boys got it!

Vince Vaughn, Paul Giamatti, Kathy Bates, and Kevin Spacey are excellent, and their talents are well utilized. The movie is funny and enjoyable throughout, with a loving yuletide spirit at the end that is truly moving. Of course suspension of disbelief is required, but so it is in most children's movies. My ten-year-old grandson loved it as did his grandfather and I. It is rightfully billed as this season's holiday classic.",1195344000,4,569,4.9375
3258833,1,B000YABV7W,"Fred Claus (Vince Vaughn) is tired of being in his younger brother's shadow.  It doesn't help that his brother is Santa Claus (Paul Giammati), or that his mother (Kathy Baker) always comments that she wishes he were  more like Santa. In order to get out of jail and buy into a night club, he has to help his brother out for the holidays. Making matters tense is an efficiency expert (Kevin Spacey) with a heart two sizes too small out to ensure that the North Pole is shut down.

Sounds like it might be entertaining. Sadly, it's not. About the funniest scene is the sight gag when Fred tries to fit into an elf-sized bed. Then the viewer realizes that this same thing was done much more imaginatively by Vaughn's sometimes co-star Jon Favreau when he directed ""Elf.""

Arguably the worst movie I have seen this year - no make that this decade - it truly amazes me that crud like this can not only get green lighted, but actually attract some top stars. This unfunny Elf knock-off is just a huge waste of time. Hard to believe it was directed by the guy that brought the far funnier ""Wedding Crashers"" to the multiplex.",1194825600,6,1118,4.465686274509804

3258835,2,B000YABV7W,"Fred Claus (Vince Vaughn) has a big problem in his life: his brother is Santa Claus (Paul Giamatti), and took away all his attention. Now he's a bitter middle-aged repo man with an exasperated girlfriend (Rachel Weisz) who's looking to nab an OTB site. However, it's worth alot of cash, so he's now forced to work for his brother at his workshop, which as elves in love (John Michael Higgins) or good with records (Ludacris). But an oily efficients expert (Kevin Spacey) is dead-set on shutting down the workshop and moving Santa and the elves to the South Pole.

So, let me get this straight. David Dobkin, the man who scored big with 2005's summer raunch comedy revival, ""Wedding Crashers"", is now getting his feet wet with a Christmas comedy for the whole family? Don't get me wrong, some films of this genre manage to be success stories, including ""A Christmas Story"" and, more recently, ""Elf"", which starred Vince Vaughn's Brat Pack cohort Will Ferrell. And Dobkin had an opportunity to make a rascally wacky comedy with Christmas as a backdrop, thus hopefully ending ""Bad Santa""'s reign as the king of ripping Chrismas apart. Isn't that what the teaser trailer a while back proved?

Sadly, that promise wasn't kept. The man who had Vince Vaughn tied up while Isla Fisher raped him seems to have been raped himself. Now he's made a family comedy that Tim Allen wouldn't dare star in anymore (at least Allen's signed up for more adult-oriented fare). The whole gimmick of this film was that Santa had a cynical brother (which Vaughn could bring to life just like that), and he would be a fish out of water in the North Pole, mixing it up with elves (which actually managed to sneak in there) and Kevin Spacey (who I'll get to shortly). But Dobkin somehow gave in to consumer demands, and now he's made a film short on comedy and high on pathos.

Because Dobkin's doing a holiday family comedy, here's just what he's done: cartoon sound effects in the beginning, treating Clyde's obsession with Superman's cape seriously instead of having fun with it, playing ""Silent Night"" during a very dramatic scene (Dobkin really screws it up here), a sappy side story with a kid that Fred is friends with, and giving St. Nick a back injury which looks like a scene from the only Adam Sandler movie I ever skipped (""Click""). This is from the guy who gave us ""Wedding Crashers"", people.

It's a shame, because there are some scenes that actually worked. There's a nice subplot involving an elf and one of Santa's little helpers (Elizabeth Banks) that can be relatable to anybody who feels indifferent to another person. And Rachel Weisz maintains quite a bit of decency as Fred's exasperated girlfriend, who at least throws in some intelligence in a throwaway role (she deserves a gold medal for achieving that). Of course, some other potentially good ideas - including Ludacris as an elf DJ - aren't emphasized enough, just as long as Dobkin can try and squeeze a teardrop from our eyes.

A shame, because the performances across the board are actually watchable. Vaughn, even though he's stuck in PG land, gives it his all and makes a likeable loser out of Fred, though he gets more screen time than Paul Giamatti (who's billed second, but hardly appears through the effort). And I've already mentioned the nice work from the side cast, so that's that.

The film ends with a Christmas jingle from Ludacris, which further indicates what ""Fred Claus"" could've been: ""Wedding Crashers"" with snow. Instead, it's slowly turning Vaughn into a Tim Allen surrogate, rather than giving him the breathing room to enjoy the environment. Maybe his highly-reported romance with Jennifer Aniston put a dent on his career, and with a film co-starring the formerly-lovable-but-now-media-ho' Reese Witherspoon, ""Four Christmas"", he could become nothing more than just fodder for Perez Hilton's loser followers.

And that's just heartbreaking...",1194566400,16,3920,4.885714285714286
3258856,4,B000YABV7W,"Surprisingly, Santa Claus has a brother, Fred. He is not a happy man and always getting himself into trouble. This stemmed from his life-long resentment for his brother, Nick (Santa Claus). When Fred got into a really big predicament, Nicholas bailed him out (literally). To pay off the debt, Nick has Fred come to the North Pole to make toys. Things had been rough up there so Nick needed the help anyway. This was working out but Nick had to watch Fred constantly because he was always making a mess of things.

Nick had his hands full trying to keep production up and his brother out of trouble but that was nothing compared to the efficiency expert who wanted to shut down the North Pole if production didn't meet regulation standards. Fred had always felt second-best to his brother so he messes up production any way he can as a way to give his brother some grief.

I really liked this movie but I wouldnt recommend it for young children. I loved the way the North Pole was portrayed. The special effects were excellent. The North Pole never looked better.

This movie was good-hearted and quite funny, especially the scene where Vince Vaughan's character visits a support group for the non-famous brothers of celebrities.

3258891,3,B000YABV7W,"Really enjoyed Elf with Will Ferrell and since Vaughn is a lot of similar (and a few the same) movies I had hoped Fred Claus would be as good.  It starts off pretty good with Vaughn, brother of Santa, as a repo man.  After a little girl kicks him for repossessing a big screen TV in her room, he gives her a clever rebuttal spiel of how her life will be better off without TV. However we never return to the repo world after this, so a lot of opportunities for laughs were missed with that omission.  The parking inspector lady girlfriend moments of disappointment for her were good, and the Salvation Army Santas chase to beat him up for encroaching on their territory was superb. But them movie  actually loses some of it's magic when it gets to the North Pole which is when it should have really become awesome.  The whole Kevin Spacey character thing was predictable and took up too much of the North Pole scenes time.  We could have had Fred stuffing up and then saving Christmas without that.  The fact Mrs Claus hates him, like a lot of wives do their husband's brothers was underutilized. A few more toy factory scenes, more brotherly arguments/fights and family tension would have made the film better . As I said we've seen the bureaucrat who hates Christmas trying to bring an end to it countless times before, we knew how that would go and it really wasn't that interesting.  The brothers of famous siblings anonymous help group thing was awesome though.  Elizabeth's Banks' character was underutilized.

The film has great moments, but a lot of filler especially at the North Pole, which as I said should have been just non stop awesome fun with the actors involved.",1514764800,,1679,4.585284280936455

3259130,3,B000YABV7W,"I really liked this movie when I first saw.  It's not a movie I can watch over and over however.  Vince Vaughn plays it over the top, as usual I guess, and it gets a bit wearing the 3rd or 4th time around.  But some of the best lines of the movie aren't his, and so I still find fun to watch on occasion.

But this is the first Christmas movie that I can recall that introduces the idea that Santa has a family and extended family at that.  Plus the movie does not play down to silly stupid in the second half as a number of other Santa movies I could name do.  So for the notion of Santa having a family, this is one I wanted for my granddaughter to see.",1453766400,,655,3.887218045112782

I thought it was a great concept for a Christmas movie because you never really think of Santa as having siblings...our family outside of the elves and Mrs. Clause for that matter. I thought this movie would be great for everyone of all ages as there really weren't any parts that were inappropriate for kids. I love that Vince Vaughn was cast in this movie as he's one of my favorite across and he plays a very funny part. I would watch this movie over and over again!

The funny moments were too few and far between and it of course included a healthy dose of predictability and Christmas movie clich.  I'm not really sure who this movie is for; it does not seem to target kids, as kids are barely featured in it. It is not interesting enough or funny enough for adults. Zero replay-ability. Watch something from the Santa Clause series and Jingle all the way again instead of watching this once.",1450742400,,511,4.666666666666667

3259190,5,B000YABV7W,"I have a few ""favorite"" Christmas time movies, and this is one of them.  I have finally broken down and purchased the DVD.  The movie is touching, as you see the Claus family interact, and how perceived trauma's of childhood can carry to adulthood (Vince and Kevin).  Vince Vaughn is a master at these types of movies.  Just look at his body of work.  I consider him a younger Rob Reiner.  And, if you need more incentive, in addition to Vince Vaughn, look at the cast!  Paul Giamatti, Kevin Spacey, Rachel Weisz, John Higgins and Kathy Bates, (just to name a few).  How can it miss?  All I can say is, sit back with your bowl of popcorn, and enjoy the movie.  You won't be disappointed.

This is an update to my review.  Although this is still one of my favorite movies, when I played it the other night, I found it was damaged.  I carefully wiped it down, but it still had ""errors"".  The movie was sealed, and was not used.  I did not contact Amazon or the seller, since it was going to be more trouble than it was worth to return it.  Hope others have a better experience.",1449100800,2,1075,4.27363184079602

3259242,2,B000YABV7W,Awful movie. Uneven. Includes pop culture references that many won't get. Not one likeable character. Flawed script. Inexplicable casting. Yuck. Just a way for some lame producers to try and squeeze a buck out of the goy at Xmastime.,1425686400,,233,5.0

3259257,3,B000YABV7W,"Maybe it was the theatre atmosphere that made this movie seem so, so much better the first time around. I remember it being so funny but then when I rented it it barely made me laugh. It barely made my kids laugh and it was their first time seeing it. Now that being said it's still not a bad choice to go with if you're looking for a holiday themed movie. It's an amusing movie but not one that will make your side hurt. It's worth watching if you're running out of stuff to watch with a holiday theme.",1423526400,,503,4.090909090909091

Not only is the plot ludicrous and downright idiotic, but it's just anti-Xmas.  Xmas and believing in Santa (for children) is about magic.  This movie tries to be so hip with even making xmas and easter, etc. corporate and modern, that it totally ruins the whole concept of the holidays.  Please, if you must watch this vomitous crap, as an adult, be kind enough to not show it to your kids.  Let them believe in magic while they can, no matter how much Hollyweird tries to ruin that,",1418342400,3,595,4.4036697247706424

It ends well (you knew that!) and both Fred and Santa learn important lessons about family.,1391299200,,337,4.365079365079365

3259435,4,B000YABV7W,"One of my favorite holiday movies, it's required viewing around the holidays at my house.  The casting of Paul Giamatti was a bit of an odd choice for Santa Claus, not that I don't like him - he just Doesn't seem right as St. Nick somehow.  Vince Vaughan does his fast-talking used car salesman routine that he does so well (and so often).  But it's a good story and the ending features a montage of  kids opening their presents that will bring a tear to the eye of any parent who has happy memories of their own little ones tearing into the packages on Christmas day.  I'm glad I made the upgrade to Blu-Ray - the picture and sound quality was a noticable improvement over the DVD.",1390953600,,682,4.338582677165355

Kids will like Santa, the elves, Christmas Town, flying reindeer, magic sleigh, etc.  - all portrayed in glowing magical special effects beauty.  Santa's Little Helper (Elizabeth Banks) is particularly distracting in her jolly outfit.  Why was she regular sized?  So many questions.",1387756800,,406,5.7

3259508,4,B000YABV7W,"I wanted to add an inexpensive movie to our Christmas collection but didn't expect much.  We were very pleasantly surprised by the film and enjoyed the characters and situations, especially Paul Giamatti's somewhat depressed and run-down Santa, who's let the years get to him until his bad boy big brother shows up to take advantage of his little brother.  When Fred turns the North Pole upside down with his shenanigans, the Malevolent efficiency expert played by Kevin Spacey plots his own revenge on the hapless Santa Claus.

3259553,1,B000YABV7W,"The movie itself gets 5 stars. But the reason I gave 1 star is because I like to add my Digital Copies to my iPad and to iCloud when I buy Digital Copy combo packs. That was my sole reason for upgrading to the 3-disc Blu-Ray+Digital Copy combo pack of Fred Claus. This turned out to be a HUGE mistake because the Digital Copy disc WILL NOT READ in iTunes. It is a Windows Media Player Digital Copy ONLY despite the fact the outer sticker that says Bonus Digital Copy says it is compatible with iTunes. It is false advertising to say it is compatible with iTunes when the Digital Copy disc WILL NOT READ in iTunes.

If you are buying this for the Digital Copy, you will feel cheated.

If you really want an iTunes Digital Copy, you MUST buy the movie from iTunes in order to get it. There is no free iTunes Digital Copy for this movie at all.

If you still want to get the Blu-Ray, it would be best if you buy the 1-disc version because ALL copies of that 3-disc Fred Claus ONLY HAVE Windows Media Player Digital Copy.",1365292800,,1017,4.205128205128205

3259555,3,B000YABV7W,"I purchased this for my son who had seen it several times and enjoyed it.  Though it may be aimed at a young audience or those with a certain sense of humor, I thought this was a creative and comical story with some touching moments.
Fred being the brother of Santa Claus, it hasn't been an easy adjustment.  According to this story, once one in a family becomes immortal, the whole family becomes immortal.  Fred tries to blend into normal society, but doesn't do it well.  Most of the time he's a con artist, trying to make it in the real world, but often getting into trouble.  When his brother Santa, decides to bail him out of jail, he requires Fred to pay him back by working at the north pole.  Though Fred has issues, especially feeling he is the lessor son, who can never live up to Santa, he also has a good heart.  When a proficiency analyzer is sent to the North Pole to check out the operation, with the possibility of shutting it down, it's Fred whose efforts change the situation from hopeless to hopeful.",1361577600,,1020,4.3936170212765955

This will forever be a part of our family's holiday traditions, along with ""Elf,"" ""A Christmas Story,"" and ""Rudolf the Red-Nosed Reindeer.""

My favorite scene is when Vince shows up at his girfriend's window trying to explain himself and she is sick of his lies.  She tells him that she is through with the relationship and his response is, I'm not.  She tells him that she can't take it anymore and his response is that he can take it still.

It is about brothers one always abusing the system and using people and the other with a heart of gold. This movie is about love forgiveness and the true bonds of family.

In fact, I've watched it so many times that I bought the Blu-Ray for fear that the DVD will wear out, however I saw no difference between the two, and the blu-ray stalled so I sent it back.

You can get the description elsewhere, but I find this movie to be a ""feel good"" with wonderful actors.  How can you possibly go wrong with Vince Vaughn, Paul Giamatti, and John Michael Higgins?

It was nice to see how Fred turned out after he realized how ""special"" Nick was and the obvious favortism their mother showed.

Sibling rivalry, modernization and over commericalization, greed, and the retreat from the true meaning of Christmas are just a few of the themes that would make for great family viewing and discussion. Plenty of laughs and quite a few poignant, heartfelt moments help Vince, Paul, and a great supporting cast masterfully capture the fun in dysfunctional family holidays. Even Santa Claus' Christmas isn't all snowflakes and candy canes. A great departure from the myth that holiday magic comes from stores and boxes.",1349308800,,615,5.285714285714286

Multiply the effects of that poor transfer by viewing it on a 60 inch 1080P plasma tv and you'll see the grainy images in all their glory.  The color is great, but the grainy images ruin what could have been a great Blu-Ray.",1328054400,,454,4.580246913580247
3259674,2,B000YABV7W,"This movie had a great idea, that Santa Claus has an older brother forced to live in his shadow, but blew it in the end.

The first big problem was the Kevin Spacey as the efficiency expert wanting to shut down Santa's operation. Acting wise, I thought Kevin Spacey did a fine job in the role, but plot wise, WHY IS THERE AN EFFICIENCY EXPERT THERE AT ALL?

This isn't the ""Santa Clause"", where Santa is a job more than a person. Santa runs the show here. Who are these people that Santa is supposed to answer to and why?

The second big is the whole naughty/nice issue. The whole naughty/nice concept is to teach children that there are rewards and consequences associated with good and bad behavior. But in this movie, the reason given is NOT that naughty children who still get a present won't learn their lesson and change their ways, but that Santa is just not able to make and deliver enough toys for everyone. It's all about taking some of the load off himself.

The third biggie is the end, where Fred visits his girlfriend in her bedroom and declares, not his love, not that he wished to marry her - giving her a ring for her Christmas present, but that he has ALREADY moved into her apartment. That was just downright creepy.",1325808000,,1235,4.427312775330397
3259675,1,B000YABV7W,There's no way anyone could give this film a good review. Someone at Warner Bros is trying to recoup their investment by planting phony 5 star reviews on Amazon.

3259676,5,B000YABV7W,I loved this movie when I first saw it and I enjoy watching it over and over at the holiday times. Both Vince Vaughn and Paul Giamatti give great performances in their respective roles. Even Kevin Spacey is fantastic. It is a great story about a family and how siblings have their differences but can in the most needed times help each other out.  It also has a great message about forgiving people who make mistakes and letting the ones important to you know how much you love them.,1325462400,,483,4.426966292134831
3259677,1,B000YABV7W,"This review is solely on the seller currently listed for this item, Mirmedia fulfilled by Amazon.  The Blu-ray I received had the following issues which made for an automatic return.  Barcode on outside was purposefully defaced with what looks like a razor blade.  They cut through the outside plastic cover and across the barcode.  Second, the clips to hold the disc trays inside the case were broken.  This meant the Bluray disc and Digital Copy Disc were just rattling around inside the case and any time you open the case you would need to prepare for these discs to immediately fall out.  Apparently the seller is rated high... so maybe this was just one mishap... but be careful when your order is fulfilled by these guys.

12/28: Update: Well I ordered a replacement for the above noted blu-ray from another ""Fulfilled by Amazon"" vendor called 'Best Deals FBA' on the website and 'Something Special LLC' on the invoice and packing slip.  This copy was almost or just as worse as the one noted above.  This one came... with 'NO' shrink wrapping... only the typical Blu-Ray Sticker on top of the case.  Also on the spine side of the case were actual holes on the top and bottom of the side.  After, seeing this I did not even bother to take the sticker off.

It seems strange that both copies of this movie appear to have been intentionally defaced by either the seller or their supplier. But, if that is what you are going to receive... they should at least note... ""You will receive a blu-ray with a busted up case"" instead of labeling it as 'new'.

Also, any illusions I had that Amazon would enforce some type of quality control, when it's a seller labeled as ""Fulfilled by Amazon"" have totally gone up in smoke.  At least they are good enough refunding... but going through the return hassle twice for the same product... that's a bit annoying.  From now on.. I am sticking to sold by Amazon only for blu-rays.",1324339200,,1920,4.605882352941176

3259683,3,B000YABV7W,"This movie really had it's ups and downs.  I thought the acting was spectacular.  Paul Giamatti was a wonderful choice for Santa.  He was so sincere, and his voice is perfect for what I think Santa would sound like.  Vince Vaughn is great.  He's really good at playing that brother who is generally a schmuck, but has a couple redeeming qualities to bring you back in.  Kevin Spacey did a great job with the ""bad guy"" role, and he's such a chameleon that you almost forget it's him.  The person that stole the show, for me, was Bobb'e Thompson who plays ""Slam.""  This kid is so funny and so good you forget he's a kid.

Here's the bad part:  The story line.  Fred is a down-and-out guy who has one more scheme to make him rich, so he calls on his brother Santa.  Of course, Santa has that tug-at-your-heartstrings reaction that makes him want to help Fred, but we all know he shouldn't.  Clyde (Kevin Spacey) is sent to ""review"" the operation with the intention of shutting it down.  Fred is put to work to earn his ""gift"" from Santa, and it puts the factory in jeopardy.

I found the movie to be funny, with spectacular acting and set design.  However, the over riding theme of codependancy was sometimes a little too much to stomach.  There were times during the movie I found myself really hating Fred, and think Santa to be too big of an idiot, that I couldn't enjoy what was happening.  But because there were other really funny moments, I couldn't give this movie too bad of a review.",1312761600,,1490,4.415441176470588

It's Christmas movie! Where was the joy? Where was the love? Not everything needs to be Elf or It's A Wonderful Life but no matter which kind of movie a holiday flick is, it has to be good such as Bad Santa. Not a family film but good.

3259685,3,B000YABV7W,"`Fred Claus' is one of those Christmas films that surprises you by being better than you expected. This follows Fred Claus, who is Santa's older, jaded brother, who has to help save Christmas when Santa injures himself. There is family history and some animosity between them, but this is put aside in the name of Christmas.

Vaughn has some funny lines and really makes this film with his comedic acting and Giamatti plays Santa very well indeed. The rest of the cast is pretty good as well and this film manages to be heart warming, without being schmaltzy; which is rare for a Hollywood film these days.

This is easy going, not too taxing, has a reasonable storyline and makes for an entertaining couple of hours viewing for all the family. Exactly what you would wish for in a Christmas film.

resolve things and help a few other people along the way. The little boy that goes into foster care and then is adopted is wonderful (more people should be foster/adoptive parents).  Anyway, when Fred looses control toward DJ Donnie and changes the music to an Elvis song....well, I laugh so hard that I can not see straight.  Vince is dancing on the table and the elves are having a blast.....It is a great show.  I would say that it is for children over 10 but my 5 year old loves the ""Elivs"" part so much that we replay that section a lot.....all through out the year.  This is a great movie!!! There is one scene where there is a group of ""unhappy siblings"" in a group session. There is Clinton, Stalone, Baldwin and more but I have to say that
Bill Clinton's brother steals that scene. Fred calls it like he sees it and then when he sees things differently....well, he calls it differently...I hope that make sense.  I do not want to give it all away. It is a great movie. We watch it at least once a month.",1293667200,,1247,4.299145299145299

With a great supporting cast around him, the jokes are never far from the screen and the fun is always following.  Paul Giamatti deserves a lot of credit for playing this whole straight and down the center. The laughs santa gets are usually because Fred is acting a certain selfish way.

The movie is absolutely hilarious in places, yet provides many tender moments. This really is well worth purchasing and watching. It has a lot of modern jokes but nothing dirty or too adult (which seems hard to find nowadays, even at Christmas). I think adults will identify with the material more than kids since it reflects on the experience of growing from childhood to adulthood in the shadow of a more-favored sibling. This will become a Christmas classic for those us us born after 1950.

Kudos to the folks who brought us a modern take on Santa and how it would be to be related to him, in good ways and challenging ones. Do yourself a favor and see this movie.",1287964800,,918,4.394117647058824

Over Mrs. Claus' objections, Nicholas agrees to help his brother on one condition: that he come to the North Pole and earn the money he needs by working in Santa's Toy Shop. The trouble is that Fred isn't exactly elf material and, with Christmas fast approaching, Fred could jeopardize the jolliest holiday of the year.

It's well cast and well acted--Vince Vaughn, Paul Giamatti, Kevin Spacey, John Michael Higgins, Kathy Bates, et. al. It has a modern sensibility and turns dark (and slows down) in the middle, but resolves nicely in a touching finale with a good (and surprisingly realistic) message. I think the special effects--especially on a small screen--look good. The story stretches credulity but it's a fairytale, after all. Don't get hung up on it.

I thought perhaps there would be a video setting I could change, but not matter what is changed on the player, it is the same black bar top and bottom.

3259724,4,B000YABV7W,"A wonderful feel-good Christmas movie, Fred Clause, brings to the screen the story of Santa Clause's older brother whose life took a turn toward naughtiness following the birth of the sibling who the world will refer to as St. Nicholas.
Fred Clause is a film about Christmas, human relations, hope and second chances as well as trust, love, and inner strength.
Vince Vaughn, Paul Giamatti, Kevin Spacey, Elizabeth Banks (who is GORGEOUS!) and the rest of the cast, have done an excellent job with their performances, though Rachel Weisz seems out of place in this movie, i.e. an Englishwoman handing out traffic violation tickets in Chicago is rather unlikely. Nevertheless, the setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all very good!
Though not a masterpiece, Fred Clause is a movie definitely worth watching as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment!",1259539200,,889,5.095890410958904
3259725,1,B000YABV7W,"After watching this movie I realized I had not laughed once, and that's rare for me.  There are other 'modern' Christmas movies that carry off the sarcastic side of Christmas without letting cynicism sink it to this kind of low.  Kevin Spacey, a phenomenal actor, was given a banal bit part which he tried his best to carry off, that of an efficiency expert who carries Santa's ""pink slip"" in his pocket.  Paul Giamatti and Vince Vaughn played it very convincingly, but the creative talents of Rachel Weisz and Miranda Richardson had no place in which to shine.  The ending did nothing to lift spirits, and it was frankly weird when at the end Fred and Nick's mother implies that her own son (Fred) is a little outclassed by his love interest, who plays a meter maid (Rachel Weisz).  What kind of mother says that about her own son (even in real life), especially after he just saves Christmas?",1259280000,2,894,4.59748427672956

The previews contained all the funny parts so it left the movie pretty dull. Definitely not a heartwarming, get in the Christmas spirit kind of movie.  Ho, Ho, Ho, Hum!",1259020800,,407,4.259740259740259

3259728,4,B000YABV7W,"I really, REALLY enjoyed this movie, which tells the story of Fred Claus (Vince Vaughn), the disenchanted older brother of St. Nicholas, a.k.a. Santa (Paul Giamatti). Fred is everything Santa is not: irresponsible, bitter, and kind of shady. However, when Santa agrees to give Fred $50,000 in exchange for helping out at the North Pole right before Christmas, Fred catches the next sleigh ride over, and hilarity ensues.

This movie is fantastically funny, mainly because of Vaughn. His character's complete disdain for all things Christmas is hilarious, from the exasperated facial expressions to the snarky one-liners. The supporting cast is wonderful as well, especially Kevin Spacey, a vindictive member of an overseeing committee that is threatening to shut Santa's operation down. Also, there's a fantastic scene where Fred attends a Siblings Anonymous meeting. I don't want to spoil it, but watch for a few cameos and get ready for a lot of laughs.

The one negative aspect of the film: Rachel Weisz, who in my opinion is one of the most annoying actresses alive. The good news in that she's not in the film very much, and even when she is on screen, Vaughn's performance is so good that he kept me laughing and made me forget how much I want to slap that chick.

Overall, ""Fred Claus"" is a smart holiday farce that is definitely worth watching. I'm going to make this movie an annual Christmas tradition at my house.",1257811200,,1424,4.9004149377593365
3259739,4,B000YABV7W,"I had avoided watching this, thinking it would be a silly story much like the various Santa Claus movies, but after finally watching it I found it to be a delightful, comical and moving tribute to things that matter most.  Sibling rivalry and how to love ourselves and not compare or be compared to our peers, how life is full of surprises and often we can rise above our limitations and challenge ourselves, and holding charity in our heart...that everyone has struggles and should be forgiven and accepted. Everyone has a little bit of naughty and nice in them, but everyone deserves a break, or in this case, a Christmas present.  That sounds deep, and the message is, but toss in gorgeous settings, a wonderful back story, beautiful score, an excellent cast and lots of laughter between the happy tears that stream down your face, and you have a fabulous Christmas special, especially for adults who may have lost their own zest for the holiday season.  Very enjoyable and highly recommended!",1248480000,,996,4.812865497076023

3259741,2,B000YABV7W,"With a cast this good, its amazing that this film is so bad! The first two thirds of the film are so depressing that I almost couldn't imagine watching this in the holiday season. Of course the ending is predicatable and uplifting, but the journey there is rather dull. It's just too little, too late.

The film is over loaded with special effects and not much else. It's not dark enough to be a black comedy and it's not sentimental enough to give you that classic holiday feeling. HO HO Hummmmmm!",1243036800,,498,4.472527472527473
3259742,3,B000YABV7W,"It's an interesting premise:  If Saint Nick had an older brother, what kind of sibling rivalry would there be?  Well, we find out in the whimsical, yet still unexciting, FRED CLAUS.  It looks like older bro Fred (Vince Vaughn, who goes through the motions, and nothing more) resents his kid sibling Nicholas because Nicholas is just so. . .good.  So Fred rebels, and while Nicholas becomes a saint endeared to the entire world his brother is a disgruntled outcast with relationship issues (why is Rachel Weisz in this movie?).  Of course, this conflict develops over centuries and centuries, because Santa Claus is immortal, therefore everyone in his family--even those who marry into it--becomes immortal.

Isn't that special?

It's impossible for Paul Giamatti to turn in a stinker, so he's admirable as a stressed-out Santa reaching out to his brother due to a Yuletide crisis.  The interaction with Vaughn is one-sided, as Giamatti puts in some effort--Vaughn coasts.  Kevin Spacey is the villain, yet the viewer never really understands why.  And the beautiful, luscious Elizabeth Banks is utterly, completely wasted in her role as a North Pole bean counter.

One scene, which I immensely enjoyed, saved good ol' FRED CLAUS from two-star status, and that was a Siblings Anonymous meeting, featuring a contrite Roger Clinton and an angry Stephen Baldwin.  It was funny, it was entertaining, it was witty, it was engaging--but one scene does not make a movie good.  Case in point:  FRED CLAUS.

3259743,1,B000YABV7W,"The lead actor is one-note Vince Vaughn, so unless you are a fan of that type you are in for a disappointment.  Also, many excellent actors are wasted in this, especially the glorious Miranda Richardson.  When you add Rachel Weiz as a supporting player and Kevin Spacey as the requisite bad guy (I could never figure out the organization he worked for where Santa was a mere employee) as well as Kathy Bates as Mom Claus, obviously the idea of this movie appealed to the players and they couldn't have known the end result.  By the way, for those interested, Gerard Butler is in a cameo.  I wondered why he was in there at all.  But overall this movie was bits and pieces and unexplained bits (including the human-sized lady elf who showcases her bosom).

The film opens surprisingly well with an inventive backstory for Nicholas Claus.  Unfortunately once you venture out of the fairy-tale realm you have a collision with the Santa mystique - complete with flying reindeer - and a brother in a metropolis who is going to a siblings anonymous meeting attended by other brothers with problems featuring cameos by Frank Stallone, one of the Baldwins (I'm not sure which one) and Roger Clinton.  Again, it probably read well on paper but in execution it is an utter mess.

This is the most unfunny comedy I have ever seen.  Instead of abandoning it completely, I suffered through it in small doses.

If you want an excellent Santa film to see, the one to stick with is the series by Tim Allen, THE SANTA CLAUS etc. Nowhere does it collide with the Santa myth but works with it and adds to the magic.",1242691200,2,1596,4.564912280701755

3259794,5,B000YABV7W,"FRED CLAUS

Since it is the month of December it was a no brainier that I would have to get into some holiday films. I decided I would start this out with a new release from this month in the form of ""Fred Claus"", which is a really good film despite being a PG rated film [took me by surprise]. Don't get me wrong there are a lot of good PG rated films out there but one starring Vince Vaughn just seems weird at first. I bring that up because some reviews I have read say that Vince's performance was bad, mainly because he wasn't in R-Rated mode. I also wanted to do this one because I just went to see Vince's new film which is also a Christmas film, ""Four Christmases"" which was a really funny film.

On that note I must say that I really enjoyed this film although to be honest I knew I would because of the cast. It turns out that we really did not know everything about Santa after all, sure all the myths were true but we never knew about his big brother Fred. It seems that Fred is the exact opposite of his little bro and is actually a bitter person holding a lot of animosity towards Saint Nick. So after a not so good childhood between the two they go their separate ways and well you know what became of Nick, Fred on the other hand ended up quite different. If Santa is a giver [at least once a year] Fred is a taker, literally, he is a repo man. Fred is an unhappy man who only has one friend in a little kid named Sam, and a shaky relationship with his girlfriend Wanda. One day he gets into a little mishap with a gang of Santa's and ends up behind bars; it is here that he makes a deal with his brother about posting bail and also giving him a lot of cash. The deal is in order to get the cash he needs Fred must agree to come to the North Pole to visit his family and work for the cash at Santa's Shop.

The film really picks up here as not only is the family getting into it with each other but they are doing it in front of Clyde Northcut, a man who is there to shut Santa's operation down. So naturally Fred's being there only adds to the problems, especially since they are on a three strike rule by Clyde. I have to say that writers Jessie Nelson and Dan Fogelman have crafted a really heartfelt, warm and funny film that is much better then it gets credit for, come on any film with some ""ninja action"" secret service Elves is good in my book. These two along with director David Dobkin [who provides a good commentary for the film] have really done a good job of not only adding in and sticking to the mythos of Santa Claus but also making this film feel real up to date. Take for instance a scene were the family Claus call an intervention for the black sheep trouble child Fred, what other film has done that?

As far as the actors go everyone does an outstanding job and really make their characters seem real. Vince Vaughn [who co-produced this film along side 4 other producers one of which is Joel Silver] as usual shines as the troubled yet quick thinker who while bad will find his way to the light, his character really is a smart guy. He is a jerk but at the same time he is really a kind hearted guy, and Vaughn brings his character to life. Paul Giamatti is nothing short of brilliant as Nick Claus, he brings a lot of emotion to the character. You can see the stress he is under from Clyde come through in his face and you can see the pain in his eyes about how he feels about his relationship with his brother. Kevin Spacey is great as Clyde who is there to end Christmas, his scene with Vince about chopping down the bigger tree is brilliant and he truly is Superman [just watch the movie]. John Michael Higgins as Willie the head elf shines as Vince's best bud up at the pole, and Bobb'e J. Thompson as Sam is really good as is Ludacris as the Elf DJ, and Trevor Peacock is great not only as Papa Claus but also as the narrator.

But this film would not have been as good if the ladies were not up to par, and they all do wonderful jobs. My favorite actress of all time Kathy Bates is great as Mama Claus who just can't seem to treat her oldest as well as her youngest. Her tension with Nick's wife is really played well, and both actresses do great jobs. Speaking of Nick Claus's wife, Miranda Richardson plays Annette Claus wonderfully and her scenes laying it onto Fred for being a screw up are great. Elizabeth Banks plays Charlene who is Willie's love interest and she does a great job, Rachel Weisz does a great job as well playing Wanda Fred's girlfriend.

I would say that this is really a good film, just go into it wanted to have a good time and you will. Maybe I liked this film so much because it is the first Christmas related film I have watched this month or maybe it is because of the significance of this month. It may be because for the first time in years I sat down and watched a movie with my mom, step dad [both came down from Maryland], brother, sister [who came down with them two], grandparents, Aunt, Uncle, 2 year old cousin and my girl that I liked it so much, either way I was really entertained. I recommend this film to everyone reading this, especially during this month. It may not be the greatest Christmas movie ever but it was still very enjoyable. Kids will defiantly like it and adults should to, it is a great story full of out there, likeable, endearing characters. I had a great time watching a funny family movie with my family gathered round.

3259796,5,B000YABV7W,"I went into this movie with low expectations to be honest, thinking it was just a silly story about Santa having a jealous brother.  But from the very beginning when they showed the boys together from the time Santa was born, I was hooked!  They actually did some development of the characters, relationships, and why people sometimes turn out the way they turn out to be due to adversity, misunderstandings, etc.  There were funny moments and demonstrations of true unconditional love.  Even the character who was not the ""sainted"" Santa, Santa's brother Fred, was able to deliver an important lesson to Santa and make Santa realize the error of his ways, which is EVERY CHILD DESERVES A PRESENT AT CHRISTMAS, there are really no ""bad"" children, just children who have done bad things because they haven't received enough love.  The North Pole Santa's workshop, etc. scenes also looked completely professional, as good as the ""Santa Clause"" series of movies.  Excellent special effects, looked like they spared no expense here.  I know why it's rated PG but since Santa doesn't look like your typical cutesy jolly soul, and since the messages are a little bit mature, I wouldn't recommend watching it with your 3 year old.

3259797,4,B000YABV7W,"I passed on this movie last year because it got poor reviews. I was looking through Amazon's selection of holiday movies this year, just because we felt like watching something different from our collection of favorites and classics. I chose this.

I looked quickly through the reviews here and many said that it was simply terrible, but some said it was okay. I am neither a huge fan or a hater of Vince Vaughn so I wondered if I would like him in this (as he has annoyed me in some movies.) I took a chance with it and my family actually watched it 3 evenings in a row. It isn't some wonderful classic that is earth-shattering in it's brilliance, but it is definitely watchable and often funny or touching. Vaughn is very good as Santa's brother and plays his snarky role with what seems like relish! Giamatti is very good as Santa and his ""straight"" type humor is effective. I have no idea what Elizabeth Banks purpose is in the movie really, but it doesn't take too much away from the story. Kevin Spacey plays a believable ""jerk."" John Michael Higgins is Head Elf, (I just loved him in ""Best In Show"") and the camera work to make him look much smaller than Vaughn is very effective. The main story itself is fine, but the other characters' stories are sort of loosely stuck in.

Overall, I think the movie is at least worth watching and even owning. We do have favorites that we like better than this, but it has some really great and funny moments that make me not regret buying it. It is a nice addition to our collection of holiday movies even if it doesn't end up being on the top of our ""favorites"" list! Don't buy it expecting Dickens, (or even ""Elf"") but it is fine for a runner-up!",1229212800,,1694,4.39171974522293
3259798,2,B000YABV7W,"How can a ""better than expected"" cast make such a mediocre Christmas film? Vince Vaughn plays....well...Vince Vaughn as Fred Claus the older brother of Paul Giamatti 's Nick Claus (older brother?!!?), the child that grows up to be ole Santa Claus himself. After off-screen Nick is Sainthooded and everyone related to him stops aging and even wives and parents will live forever (but forget about that point because a life of eternity is never mentioned again). Anywho, a couple of hundred years later Fred Claus is living as a loser in New York who due to his jealousy of his great brother, gets thrown in jail with a run-in of a few mall Santas, and as a last resort calls St. Nick to bail him out. But Santa wants something in return, and that's for his only brother to help out an over-worked North Pole by paying a visit. Ho, ho, oh-no! After a few mishaps with the elves, some of which have decided to take up Ninja-style defense training (you heard me), an efficiency expert shows up (wildly misused Kevin Spacey) and tries to shut down Santa's operation and outsource it to the South Pole. So, it's up to this Grinch of a brother to save the day, don the redsuit, and get the toys delivered on time.

What got me about this film is that I couldn't figure out who it's core audience was. Too satirical for kids, too bland for adults. While the effects were XMas-y enough, if you were to take out the A-list actors, this would have played perfectly on Lifetime or ABC Family starring Luke Perry. And as for the elf actors, two of which played by John Michael Higgins and rapper Ludacris, they used the CGI-the-face-over-the-little-person effect like in Little Man, but very scrooge-like in making it look real. And why did Rachel Weisz agree to be in this for just three scenes? I guess not doing that last Mummy movie got her on the naughty list.

So while the movie isn't a complete piece of coal, some scenes are slighly humourous like the Siblings Anonymous meeting Fred attends with other sufferers like Frank Stallone, Roger Clinton, and Stephen Baldwin. But at a tiring one hour and fifty-six minutes, this could have trimmed out more fruitcake and gave better presents. And if that wasn't bad enough, the one-disc's only bonus is twenty-five MORE minutes of deleted scenes?!!? Yipes, it's gonna actually BE Christmas by the time I finish this! So in conclusion, it's a decent rent for the holidays, but ask Santa for a better DVD to be placed in your stocking than this one because like most gifts you get this day, it will be forgotten by New Years.

Fred comes into his own and advocates for all children, not just the good ones and becomes the hero of the hour.

There was a scene that was really fun I liked where Fred has the elves play a song other than the one they always played and they all ensue in a very fun, creative dance that's very joyful and fun.

It is for kids and parents to watch as a family, and learn a little bit about real life situations, at the same time relates to Christmas and a must have for any Christmas movie Guru. It is based on Fred the brother of Santa, or Nicholas. And tells the story of how he became what he was, and what happened to make him better in the end. My kids and my wife enjoyed this, as did I.

3259812,3,B000YABV7W,"Yes we've all seen this scenario before, for one reason or another Santa Claus (Paul Giamatti) is unable to make his yearly rounds on Christmas Eve so someone has to step up and fill the breach by donning the red suit and delivering presents to all the children of the world before dawn. This time the responsibility falls on the shoulders of Santa's estranged brother, Fred (Vince Vaughn). Why anyone would attempt to follow in the boot prints of Tim Allen who played the part of the reluctant Santa to perfection in `The Santa Clause', `Santa Clause 2' and `The Santa Clause 3 - The Escape Clause' is beyond me. When you stop and think about it, the '07 film `Fred Claus' most resembles the third installment of the forementioned films which just so happens to be by far the worst of the three.

Having written the above you're probably expecting me to slam `Fred Claus' mercilessly. Well, not exactly. For all intents and purposes this movie had all the trappings of a major bomb waiting to explode, but miraculously that didn't happen. Despite the retread of old storylines the film manages to maintain the interest of the audience from beginning to end primarily to the credit of the always lovable Vince Vaughn. By playing the part of Fed Claus in a low key fashion he keeps things from coming off too ridiculous yet injects enough personality and humor to make the character and story work. Paul Giamatti delivers his usual strong performance, head elf Willie played by John Michael Higgins is immensely entertaining and the fetching Elizabeth Banks is enchanting as Santa's assistant. Add to the cast the talented Kevin Spacey, Rachel Weisz and Kathy Bates along with first rate production values and an upbeat soundtrack of recognizable tunes and you're good to go,

This movie was pretty much a monumental flop.  I don't know who they were trying to cater to in this movie -- kids, adults, or both.  It was kind of a jumbled mess, all the way throughout.  A few funny parts here and there, but nothing to write home about.

Vince Vaughn, I love him dearly, but he was off his game throughout the entire film.  Almost as if he didn't feel comfortable in the role, or comfortable on set, or something.  The entire movie, it just failed to click.  Every time I thought the film was picking up steam, it fell flat on its face again.

I'd give this movie 1 star, but I'm giving it an extra 1 star for the ending of the movie, which actually saved it.  I walked away from the movie thinking, ""Ok, wasn't the WORST movie ever, but wasn't too good.""  If it weren't for the ending, I might have called it the worst movie of 2007.  Harsh, but true.

3259830,3,B000YABV7W,"""Fred Claus"" desperately wants (and tries too hard) to be a modern Christmas movie classic in the tradition of ""Elf."" ""Fred Claus"" is actually the opposite of ""Elf."" Wheras Will Farrell's elf Buddy brought North Pole Magic with him into a world-weary New York City, in ""Fred"", several real-world problems come crashing down into the North Pole, nearly cancelling Christmas forever.
  All families are disfunctional (to varying degrees) and those disfunctions always seem to come out during the holiday season. Screenwriters Dan Fogelman and Jessie Nelson take this idea and run with it to the endth degree in ""Fred Claus."" Tired of living in the saintly shadow of his brother Nick-- A.K.A. Santa Claus, Fred (Vince Vaughn) is completely estranged from the Claus family. Living in Chicago, Fred is a repo-man. (What Santa Claus giveth, Fred taketh away). Eventually, Fred winds up in jail and brother Nick (Paul Giamatti) bails him out-- on the condition that Fred come for a visit to the North Pole. Fred arrives just as the North Pole and Christmas come under attack from Clyde Northcutt (Kevin Spacey), an ""efficientcy expert"" with grudges and an axe to grind. Kevin Spacey seems out of place, and rather uncomfortable, in this role.
  Your enjoyment (or lack thereof) of ""Fred Claus"" will depend on how you respond to the rascally, slightly smarmy, comedic persona of Vince Vaughn. The best scenes seem to be improvised by Vaughn on the spot. I particularly enjoyed the scene where Fred changes the music in the Elves' workshop from a cloyingly sweet and bland Doris Day to a rocking Elvis Presley. Vaughn races down the stairs saying to the Elves, ""Let's make some bad decisions together! "" Nick enters and sees Fred and the elves engaged in a rocking free for all and exclaims, ""ho, ho, holy crap!""
  Paul Giamatti is quite good as a very harried and stressed out St.  Nick. Parents may be a bit shocked when he tells Fred that Christmas has gone right ""down the crapper!"" Fred and Nick engage in a snowball fight. Then, a crazed Nick tries to run Fred over with a snowmobile! The Clauses, along with Nick's girlfriend (Rachel Weisz) attend a ""family therapy"" session; or ""intervention."" Back in Chicago, Fred attends a ""Brothers Anonymous"" meeting with  (in  funny cameos) Frank Stallone, Roger Clinton, and Stephen Baldwin! Stephen seems particularly angry with Alec. Nobody believes Fred when he says that his brother is Santa Claus, but Roger Clinton speaks the magic words that convince Fred that he must save the Claus family honor, as well as Christmas itself.
  The DVD includes both Widescreen and Full-Screen Versions of the film on one double-sided disc. Director David Dobkin offers an overly-effusive, self-congratulatory, ultimately boring,  Commentary Track. ""Fred Claus"" may not be ""Elf"" or ""Miracle On 34th Street"", but thankfully it is not crass or mean-spirited like ""Bad Santa.""

Of course there are the sappy and yeah-right moments that make the movie a warm, fuzzy family movie. Cheesiness happens, but really, in the North Pole you gotta expect some sugar and/or cheese. There are a few off-color comments and/or double entendres but it is pretty clean overall.

The most amusing theme is the sibling rivalry. Nicholas (Giamatti) is a saint of course, and Fred, well, he's the older and forgotten brother, which requires a few laugh-out-loud counseling sessions.
