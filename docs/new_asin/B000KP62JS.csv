2696790,4,B000KP62JS,"The stories are predictable, there is a jump-the-shark moment when Oprah's brother in the series becomes her cousin; Olivia Cole's Sophie was much better in the movie than here in the series; Brenda Pressley is exceptional in the role once played by Jackee.

This ran for 11 episodes, and the first episode was written by The Waltons and Falcon Crest and Palmerstown creator/writer Earl Hamner and some episodes were directed by Ivan Dixon of Car Wash.

I watched the entire 11-episode series in one sitting as they were only 30 minutes long each. I was left wanting for more.",1196467200,13,576,4.808080808080808

[This is no hype or joke.]

The television series BREWSTER PLACE (recently released on DVD) is such a fine example of Black television at its best that when I look back at the eleven 22 minute episodes which originally aired in 1990 I am both amazed, dismayed, and proud.  This half-hour TV show was so outstanding that it had to be killed-off, and quickly, before it gathered steam and a loyal Black audience (as did the much later Showtime series, SOUL FOOD.)  This show was not killed due to poor ratings, despite this or any other specious reasons given--rather it was killed because it showed in just 22 minutes (as did Tim Reid's FRANK'S PLACE) Black people in their total humanity--as everyday people struggling to overcome problems in their lives--some related to race, some not--as Black men, Black women, and Black children--not as deviants, crack-heads, and criminals, but as people with warmth, compassion, and humor.

This excellent 11 episode series, which was too hot and heavy for network and back-room politicos in 1990, is still as fresh and outstanding in 2007 as it was then.

This is a must as a DVD--one I'm not ashamed to admit I waited on for 16 years.  Kudos to Oprah Winfrey for releasing it.",1186704000,27,1473,4.895582329317269

2696800,5,B000KP62JS,"This was a wonderful series based on the Women of Brewster Place. I thought I had brought the original, but to my surprise, it was this series. I did not know a series was made, I viewed this DVD and loved this series just as well. I would recommend this DVD.

2696801,5,B000KP62JS,"I PURCHASED THIS DVD AFTER REMEMBERING THE SERIES THAT CAME OUT IN THE EARLY 90'S BECAUSE I LOVED THE WOMEN OF BREWSTER PLACE MOVIE. AFTER SEEING ALL THE EPISODES AGAIN, SOME I REMEMBERED MORE THAN OTHERS, IM GLAD I MADE THE PURCHASE. FROM THE THEME SONG BY TAKE 6 TO THE ACTUAL EPISODES, IT WAS A GOOD SERIES. IM NOT SURE WHY THE RATINGS WERENT GOOD BACK THEN, BUT AFTER SEEING ALL THE EPISODES ON THE DVD, IT LEFT ME WANTING TO SEE MORE AND WISHED THEY HAD AT LEAST ONE MORE SEASON. OPRAH WASNT GIVEN HER JUST DUE AND CREDIT FOR THIS SERIES BECAUSE IT WAS FUNNY, SERIOUS, AND REALLY GREAT ACTING ON ALL THE CHARACTERS PARTS. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DVD PURCHASE TO ALL THOSE THAT HAVENT SEEN IT. IT'S NOT EXPENSIVE AND YOU HAVE AT LEAST 11 EPISODES FOR THE COST. THE CHARACTER OF SOPHIE PLAYED BY OLIVIA COLE WAS AN EXCELLENT CHOICE TO INCLUDE IN THE SERIES. I WISHED MORE OF THE THE ORIGINAL MOVIE CHARACTERS SUCH AS JACKEE', ROBIN GIVENS, PHYLLIS YVONNE STICKNEY, LONETTA MCKEE, LYNN WHITFIELD, AND BARBARA MONTGOMERY COULD HAVE BEEN IN THE SERIES. IM ALMOST CERTAIN IF MORE ORIGINAL MOVIE CHARACTERS WERE IN THE SERIES, THE RATINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN ALOT BETTER AND THE SERIES WOULD HAVE LASTED ALOT LONGER AT LEAST A COUPLE OF SEASONS. ALL IN ALL, I GIVE TWO THUMBS UP AND RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE",1336348800,3,1304,4.506329113924051
