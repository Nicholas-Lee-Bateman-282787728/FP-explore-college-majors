8014516,3,B0001M6XDU,"I had seen it as play first, but the translation to a movie is not very satisfactory. Corbett plays the Simple Man as too simple. He's clearly a man deserving of our sympathy, but it's overdone and lacks credibility. A Tart With A Heart is pretty much a cliche and that's how Cilento plays it as well. The supporting characters are rather more three-dimensional, and more interesting for that.",1486425600,,393,4.7101449275362315
8014517,3,B0001M6XDU,"Good British 60's sleeper. After a soccer game a 39 year old virgin goes to a bar with some work buddies. While there his friends make a bet about him taking a blonde (Diane Cilento) home. She overhears this and decides to go against the wager. She takes the shy guy to her apartment and entertains with lies about a past wealthy lifestyle. He's naive enough to believe them. You route for them to get together.

The movie is affectionate towards its lead characters. You can tell it was based on a play by its chatty nature but it makes good use of the London background. Cilento guves a sexy energetic performance here. She's a discovery. I will be looking into her.",1125014400,7,668,4.475409836065574
