7973749,4,B0000714DS,"Harry Woltz (James Belushi) is on top of his form. He is an undercover cop and had a big bust with the help of his assistant Gwen Buckley (Angela Featherstone). He is sweet on her and all is right. Or it would be if it was not for his gambling habit. It is time to pay up and he must perform a simple but distasteful act and all will be square. Did I say simple slowly the plot unravels and he finds it not so simple and it gets more complex he finds that there is only ""One Way Out.""",1507248000,6,484,3.85

7973751,2,B0000714DS,"Are these reviews fake? I like a couple of James Belushi movies. Not this one. It started off slow, got really good, then ended terribly. I don't understand the letdown. The acting wasn't good either. I'd advise you at least check out the movie trailer before purchasing this below average thriller.",1469923200,,299,4.882352941176471

7973755,4,B0000714DS,"The movie was just flat out entertaining. It was a pretty well made movie that flowed pretty smoothly and had plenty of action and bad guys.

I will watch this movie again. It was better than 3 star and close to a 4 star to me. I want to be entertained and a somewhat plausible plot even though not likely seems to keep my interest better than movies where the Karate guy wipes out the entire mob. This was one that kept my interest and was enjoyable to watch.

James Belushi just seems to be the guy next door that finds himself in the wrong place and but thinks fast and gets out alive. I like James Belushi but I like Bruce Willis too and he has been in some horrible poorly made movies. I wish Belushi would make some more action movies such as No Way Out. No Way Out was not an expensive enterprise but flowed well and kept my interest. A four star to me means I put it with my movies to watch again knowing that I will like it.  Each to their own taste but I only like about 25% of movies that I watch. This was OK",1389312000,,1020,4.014778325123153
