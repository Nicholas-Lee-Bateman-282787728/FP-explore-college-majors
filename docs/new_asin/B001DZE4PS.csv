8295540,4,B001DZE4PS,"Although limited in communication skills, my 16yo autistic son LOVES to listen to other languages ... I am pretty sure in our VAST collection of DVD's, that we own every Bilingual Baby ever produced.  I myself haven't watch it, as watching a DVD with my son is PURE torture, as he has little snippets that he likes and he will play them CONTINUALLY. However, based on the times he has ""viewed"" it - I'd say it was a good purchase.",1470700800,,430,4.375
8295541,4,B001DZE4PS,Pretty good DVD to play if you want to passivly learn Russian. Just turn it on and play it in the background until you pick it up.,1363478400,,130,3.8518518518518516

8295543,1,B001DZE4PS,"The quality of the picture is bad, the subject matter for a toddler is pretty boring, it's just a person reading Russian words outloud.  My toddler did not show much interest in this video at all.",1299801600,3,196,4.444444444444445
