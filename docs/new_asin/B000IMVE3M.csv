2659137,2,B000IMVE3M,"As other reviews about the series itself were already written I decided to write this review on the packaging of the series and its quality. First and foremost I must declare that this series is amazing and you should buy it...but you might not want to buy this edition.

When I received mine and opened it I found out that the box set for the second season had a big crack right on top of the place where you open the box. Unsurprisingly more plastic fell off as I opened the case. Also the 2 box sets (the first and second season comes in separate boxes) are placed inside a thin paper box, so thin that if you put a DVD box ontop of it it will bend. Another thing worth mentioning is that the DVD's are placed inside a plastic holder. They are not inserted into any kind of sleeve or paper packaging and in case your box has a crack (like mine did) they will be exposed to air.
One must also address the image quality. It is very bad. Now, I know this series aired in 1994, and I didn't have high expectations. But the quality is so bad that I highly tend to believe they used VHS as the source of these DVD. If I buy a DVD I expect close to DVD quality, and although the series aired on 1994 this US release is from 2006! Someone obviously took an old copy of this show and just slapped it on some DVDs.

To conclude: you should buy the series, but not from this company, and not in this format. Maybe in a couple of years a better version befitting this great series will be produced.",1262563200,,1489,4.13103448275862
2659138,5,B000IMVE3M,"*The first section of the review is the contents of the box. The section section will be the story overview.

-----------------The Box Review------------------------------------------

-The Artwork-

Just as the picture shows although the box itself is thin and flimsy as a poster. This can easily be bent or squashed out of proportion if stored carelessly.

-Inside the Cases-

There are only two cases for the entire series. Series 1 case (containing the first season) and Series 2 case (contains the second). The artwork on the cases is the same as purchasing them separately.

However as a slight disappointment all the CD's are contained inside one case for their respective season. This would have been convenient had it not been for the slight mechanical problem. The CD's must be put back in a certain way that they are overlapping the other CD's. If not they have a tendency to slide out of their respective places. Also the CD's are not numbered. Each CD for the first season has artwork on the cover. The Second Season is labeled by words.

-Goodies and Extras-
As for the last season 1 disc it contains two interviews concerning Magic Knight Rayearth. We learn that Nova was a character based on Iczer 1 by the director of the television series. The CD's contain special features as spell index, bloopers, and omake endings.

*All the extra features claimed on the back of the box are on the Season 2 discs.

Language:
Japanese, English. Subtitles available.

-------------The Story---------------------------------------------
""Watashi wa, Emeroudo Hime""
-Princess Emeraude

-Season 1-

Hikaru, Umi, and Fuu are the three main heroines in this series. Unknownigly as the girls are in Tokyo tower a mysterious glowing beauty that pleads for their help. Immediately the girls are whisked off into a strange land and caught by a giant flying fish before falling to their dooms. Master Mage Clef greets the girls after a quick introduction of power-showing. There it is explained that the High-Priest Zagato has stolen Emeraude Hime, who is the pillar of Cephiro. By her clean thoughts and constant prayer she is able to Cephiro a land of peace by the sheer power of her strong will. However Cephiro is becoming a place where monsters roam freely and the people are trapped in fear.

As the 3 premature Magic-Knights are whisked away on a eagle to avoid Zagato's minion, Acylone from destroying them they are left the task to become Magic Knights and save Cephiro from destruction. This is the beginning of their adventures, trials, tears, and triumph in the land called Cephiro.

Magic Knight Rayearth is a funny, serious, yet quick-pace action series with a surprise ending that centers around the three girls and how Cephiro may not be as it is seen to be. Allies and Friends are made along the way. Some depart for good, and even the villains have their reasons for being the way they are, whether it is deemed good or evil. If you are a fan of Christian Hans Anderson's ""Little Mermaid"" and like Sailormoon, then this series may prove interesting to you.

Everything in Cephiro is controlled by will. However it is only those who have a strong-will that are the true earth-shakers, which can be anyone who possess that determination, even the villains. Each episode is filled with some interesting monster battles, so you'll never be bored by ""idle-talk"" unlike the Dragonball Z series. The monsters can be unique, ranging from cute-little forest creatures who are truly beast themselves, to a wall of light that is attracted to blood. As said before, Cephiro is not as it truly appears to be.

As the Knights evolve as well as their armor and magic they are at last faced with a grueling task. Complete their mission, or allow sorrow to destroy their only hope of going back home?

--------Season 2---------------------

Season 2 picks up where Season 1 ends. Cephiro is without a pillar and is endanger from extinction. But that isn't the only problem. Now that the invisible wall that Emeraude made is gone invading countries have their eyes set upon the power of the pillar system. And now a new villian appears, much stronger than the last. This villian is of Cephiro yet it is not of Cephiro. A villian which was purely ""wished"" upon by the people, created by their insecurities, their fears, their hatred and their anguish. Even Hikaru herself, Nova. Unlike the first season however, this time the Knights aren't simply taking forced-orders. This time, they want to fight with their own wills.

Season 2 provides some very interesting background concerning Cephiro and the pillar system. Old allies and friends and reunited, as well as old and new enemies. Nova is Hikaru's fears and doubts and she knows it. At times Nova seems to be compassionate, but by a quick and abrupt insane personality switch she becomes a spastic dysfunctional being that screams ""I You Hikaru!"" while attempting to tear her and her allies apart. As the first season the action-pace stays true but this time the Knights can choose what they want to do with Cephiro.

If you never heard of this wonderful classic series ""Magic Knight Rayearth"" or are simply interested in picking up a more 'action-filled' magical girl set, MKRE is for you.",1245456000,,5237,4.916099773242631
2659139,5,B000IMVE3M,"This item arrived in perfect condition.  This anime is full of heart.  Three young girls are transported to the magical world of Cephiro, their only hope of return is to save this strange and beautiful world from the evil Lord Zagato.  The road is challenging and perilous, but they make many new friends along the way.  But can they defeat Zagato, and save Cephiro's beloved Princess Emeraude?  The truth lies in a heartbreaking secret.  This was one of CLAMP's first anime's but that does not make it dull in any way.  If you love anime, and especially fantasy anime, then you will truly fall in love with this series.  This particular set comes with seasons 1 and 2, so you get the entire saga.  Hope you enjoy it as much as me and my children have!",1244937600,,752,4.470588235294118
2659140,4,B000IMVE3M,"I've been looking for this anime for awhile now....This is one of clamp's works animated! The graphics are not bad, and it comes with both e english dubbed & e original japanese voice actresses with english subs...that's a good thing too! If you really like clamp's works, this is a good collection as any.",1228089600,,306,4.685185185185185
2659141,5,B000IMVE3M,magic knight rayearth was the first anime that made really love anime.  i love this anime because the art is beutiful and and story closely follows the manga.  any who loves anime needs to see the clasic series.,1221782400,,211,4.526315789473684
2659142,5,B000IMVE3M,"This work begins very whimsically... the pace starts off light hearted and playful, and over the course of the anime builds to a meaningful, and exciting climax!

The production quality feels dated but the content of this work is so valuable it could have been done as cave paintings made from berry pigments and it would still stand the test of time today... this is simply magnificent work!

It explores the building of friendships and the power of love, and hits both targets with the accuracy of a seasoned marksman.

I wouldn't have expected any less from this works original story writers CLAMP (Chobits, Angelic Layer, and many others).

With unbelievably rich story telling and a dramatic plot twist you simply MUST OWN this work if you want to be moved to laughter, experience what someone will do for love, and feel the building of solid friendships.

When this is all said and done you feel like you have many new friends and are sad to see the story come to an end.

Meaningful story!

FANTASTIC Anime!

A Must own!",1220227200,3,1027,4.666666666666667

Actually, just listening to the music is enough to give you a pang (you either feel like crying, or smiling). I've seen this anime when I was a teenager and now I decided to buy it and add it to my collection.",1175040000,8,351,4.176470588235294

8146386,5,B000IMVE3M,"Best magical girl anime ever. Just how good is it? My husband watched it with me. That is how good it is. This is the first time I have seen it is Japanese with subs, and I prefer it this way. The three heroes are delightful. The story makes sense. The art is divine. I recommend the manga, too, but since the anime follows the manga more or less, you can read them in either order. I especially liked the fact that Hikaru, Umi and Fuu had well rounded personalities and that each of them grew during the series in a way that made sense based upon their initial personality. There were no sudden changes in character, of the type that you see sometimes in children's fantasy stories (such as those of C.S. Lewis, whose children can go from bratty to heroic in the blink of an eye). All three had the seeds of heroism in them--that was why they were chosen---but all three had to go through trials in order to achieve their full potential as  Magic Knights.",1406419200,,956,4.340782122905028

After watching it, I found again with my daughter and we watched it together. Needless to say, nostalgia and family make it even better than originally remembered.",1365897600,,313,4.508771929824562
8146390,5,B000IMVE3M,"I always get a little picky buying stuff used unless it's ""like new"" but this was in very good condition and it was not bad at all I have yet to play the discs (I just got them today) but they seem to be in relatively good condition. The discs have a few small prints and blemishes but it's nothing that can't disappear with the use of CD cleaner. I'm very satisfied. This is a great anime for young children. It's a magical girl series similar to Cardcaptor Sakura if anyone is familiar with it. This is made by the same creator CLAMP and is about 3 young girls saving an alternate universe to prevent their war from reaching Earth. A very nice and cute story and great for any anime collectors.

A firend introduced me to this anime, I was hooked on it like glue... Love everything about it. Season one fouces on the princess and the magic knights arrival, but there is an ironic twist in the end of season one, I have to say I did cry...Season two is my favorite season with the arrvial of Nova and her sercet orgin that left my mouth on the floor. I love this anime becasue it shows how a person's well and heart can make a real difference. I do highly recommend this anime for all anime fans to buy and have in your collection.
