8043419,5,B0006UF7OS,"I've literally watched hundreds of instructional videos making various claims. Warrior Wellness not only exceeded any expectations, it saved my friend's life and has become a life-long part of mine.
I gave this set to Big Tom ten years ago when he could barely walk to the door. He would literally have to turn his entire body to turn his head. Very few thought he would make it to see his 55th birthday and the people at church wanted to buy him an electric scooter for mobility.
I had a better idea, force Tom to begin his patch to mobility through Warrior Wellness!
Within 6 months he could walk a mile. By the end of the year he won his church's over 50, 50 yard dash!
Scott Sonnon might come across as an odd character but he has been through a lot in life. He's in better shape at 20 than 10 and in better shape at 30 than 20. Now, he's in his 40's an in the best shape of his life. You know he's doing something right.
Warrior Wellness is different than Western thinking in that it does not focus on flexibility or muscle strength. It's all about range of motion and joint strength. Anyone, at any age can do this and you never have to advance past the beginner level.
Do this every day for the rest of your life and it will be the best move you ever made!",1368144000,,1263,4.20164609053498
8043420,5,B0006UF7OS,"Scott Sonnon has a lot of fitness and wellness materials out, and for me they vary greatly in quality and suffer from a lack of a coherent overall organizing theme that someone unfamiliar with his training philosophy can understand.  Don't misunderstand, Scott does organize his materials, but the organization is a little too clever for 'outsiders' to appreciate, and comes off as somewhat parochial, so it can be very hard to figure out where in the overall scheme each program is supposed to fit.  I have dozens of his tapes and DVDs because I often learn from his materials, but there is only one that I find myself coming back to again and again because I feel I understand what it is supposed to accomplish and can remember it and use it anywhere and anytime.  That program is Warrior Wellness.

It's a shame that they discontinued this ingenious program because it is one of the best things this author has produced in my opinion.  It is a very straightforward, efficient, and effective solution for any situation where you need to prepare for more strenuous movement.  It is a very comprehensive joint by joint mobility program that while using relatively simple movements hits a wide variety of angles in multiple dimensions.  From the first time I watched this DVD to the present day I have used the movements from this program as part of my basic warmup, and I often even use it to get ready for the day when I feel stiff in the morning.  It serves as a great ""diagnostic check"" of all your important joints when you aren't feeling 100%.

I wouldn't rely on this alone as for flexibility improvement, but that's not its primary purpose.  The movements are optimized to help your joints function best in their current natural range of movement, not to radically increase your range of movement.

Personally, I much prefer this program to ""Intu-Flow,"" the far more elaborate program that replaced it.  Intu-Flow seems to me to have a lot more complex movements and many of them seem more arbitrary to me.  I find it harder to remember the sequences from that program, and consequently it has not ""stuck"" for me like Warrior Wellness did.  It takes longer and doesn't seem to accomplish any more than Warrior Wellness.

For those situations where you want a joint by joint checkup or preparation for strenuous movement prior to your more sport-specific warmup movements, a very useful tool to have in your kit, Warrior Wellness is a top of the line easy to use and effective program.  If you can get a copy, treasure it.  If not, the Intu-Flow product has much of the same materials in it, although I think most people will have to put more time and effort into getting the same benefit from it compared to Warrior Wellness. In Intu-Flow, Scott stretches the elegant joint set from Warrior Wellness into an hour long ""longevity system"" workout that turns the mobility system into a more complete low-intensity fitness session for improving quality of life by improving quality of movement.

8043421,5,B0006UF7OS,"The exercises seem real strange at first but once I started performing them each morning I could feel the difference for the rest of the day. Less joint pain and fewer clicks. If I skipped a day, I really notice.

This joint warm up has become one of my favourite exercises. Highly recommended.",1186790400,,294,4.547169811320755
8043422,3,B0006UF7OS,"This is a good way to keep joints working. I just don't understand why Sonnen has to put his ideas above others'. His claims that this will help 'fix the damage' caused by other modalities, including yoga, is very misleading: Properly done, yoga, (or even weightlifting), is perfectly healthy, while done sloppily, even 'Warrior Wellness' can cause injury,(I've since seen Sonnen doing plyometrics, which are notorious for causing  injuries). Decades, (even centuries, in the case of yoga) of benefit, make Scott's put-downs seem juvenile, especially considering that his copyrighted ""Prasara"" -is- yoga, along with much of 'Warrior Wellness'. If you compare his work to the performances of any expert, whether an Ashtanga adept, or even a top-flight highschool gymnast, Sonnens 'way' breaks down to mid-level ability at best in performances of multiple arts: Nothing wrong with that, but leave the real guys alone.",1164672000,5,915,5.398601398601398
8043423,5,B0006UF7OS,"I'm on a wellness kick. Why wait till you get ill before you do something for your health. 6-degress of freedom, simply 25 minutes every morning and after 4 weeks I CAN tell a difference. Do yourself a favor and commit to Warrior Wellness for yourself and your family. Per the author's suggestion I have not attempted the intermediate or advanced workouts yet ... I am waiting the recommended 6 months.",1124064000,3,402,4.676056338028169
8043424,5,B0006UF7OS,"Body weight exercises are all the rage- and with good reason. But one thing many of the fitness gurus are missing is the ability to actually link their exercises to real world applications. After all, we don't do things like pushups and situps to get good at doing pushups and situps- the idea is that they have an application to the rest of our activites. Coach Sonnon (and he really works like a coach, not like a guru, or a trainer- like a coach who is honestly interested in your success) manages to provide a real world series of 'exercises' (movements really) to regain the range of motion, ability and 'wellness' that you once had as a child. In that Sonnon succeeds. I've been following this program (and the 'Body-Flow' series) for about 4 months or so, and, despite a large amount of competitive injuries from earlier martial arts work, I'm moving with no pain, stiffness or those problematic 'popping and cracking' of my joints.

It's not a miracle- it does require work and dedication- but in a short time, with some earnest effort, Scott Sonnon has presented a program to renew both your body and mind.

8043425,5,B0006UF7OS,"This DVD is a compilation of what was formerly a set of three videos, so it includes all three levels of exercises: Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced, with the advantage of being able to select from the menu screen any particular set of exercises (neck, or shoulder, for instance) from any level. As someone who had worked my way through the initial three videos, this gives me the opportunity to focus on specific exercises to review in depth from time to time.

I've been doing the ""exercises"" for over a year and a half & have noticed significant changes for the better in movement, agility, balance, injury prevention and recovery, etc. I remember wanting to hurl Jane Fonda's video out the window after watching it a few times some years ago, but felt no such compulsion about Coach Sonnon's taped demos. Liked him better with each viewing.

I strongly recommend this for any adult who would like to maintain and improve movement and quality of life as they age.",1103155200,12,969,4.761904761904762
