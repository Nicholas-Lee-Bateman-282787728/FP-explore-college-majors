The quality of the clips is actually very good, and a far cry from the shot-with-a-handheld-camcorder quality the other reviewer states. Let's say they're pro-shot budget clips. The Gothic Industrial Madness alone runs for wel over 3 hours so there's plenty to choose from. 0n a standard def TV set, on which this dvd was originally intended to be watched, the picture doesn't exhibit pixellation of macroblocking of any kind. The people who mastered this knew what they were doing. Don't forget the clips are from around 1995; no hi-def then, remember ?

Sound is generally excellent lossy AC3 with emphasis on the bottom end so your sub is in for a sweaty workout; love that.

The version of GIMadness included on this box is the early one, on which you could not skip from one song to the next. This flaw was corrected on a re-release 10 years after; That's the one I own.

Get it cheap and you'll love it. Quantity + quality of great underground music.",1350172800,,1020,4.624309392265193
8017286,4,B0001WTW4W,"This dvd set is for hardcore goth fans..very grainy, raw, very refreshing at the same time..worth the money...",1221782400,,110,5.166666666666667
8017287,1,B0001WTW4W,"This is a two-DVD set with over 55 clips of groups rainging from Christian Death, Goetus, Clock DVA, Die Krupps, Psychic TV, Switchblade Symphony to Lords of the New Church, Red Lorry Yellow Lorry and Chameleons U.K. Most, if not all of the clips look like they were filmed with a hand held 16mm and and most of the songs have an unrelenting ""sameness"" to them. Once you open the box, there is NO packaging, just blank boxes and a disc in each box. It feels like someone was cleaning out the storage room and threw all this stuff together. For hard-core fans of obscure Goth and Industrial bands only.",1085961600,6,601,4.472727272727273
