8615864,3,B005Y5CYU0,"Nice footage of some classic lines and cars - decent narration.  Video focuses on only a few  lines but good quality.  Only problem is this DVD will not play in many DVD players - would not load in my DVD recorder or high end player - ironically my bottom of the line TV/DVD combo played it fine, thus you may have to try a couple DVD players to find one that will handle it - I am not quite sure why this is.",1366761600,,409,3.9036144578313254
