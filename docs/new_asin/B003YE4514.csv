4228593,5,B003YE4514,"Battlefield has it's World War 2 documentaries divided into 4 groups of 3 documentaries. Each documentary is 2 hours long and focuses on a major battle while giving a good summary of the situation, leaders, commanders, men and equipment in the first hour and a good basic explanation of the battle and after effects in the 2nd hour.  Invasion includes documentaries on the invasions of North Africa, Italy, and Normandy.  Although these are not the major fronts of the war, they had significant effects on the Eastern and Western fronts. I was particularly impressed by the connection shown in the documentaries of North Africa and Italy and their connection with the Russian front.",1325721600,12,682,5.0265486725663715
4228594,5,B003YE4514,"I first saw this series on PBS and have often wanted to see it again. More than any other war documentary, this suite brings out the awful magnitude of WWII. The organization of each segment is designed to bring out every aspect of the key engagements with clarity and power. This includes a critical analysis of political and military strategies as well as the weapons and forces used by each side. The mistakes made by the Nazis and the Allies are told with simplicity and balance. Although the computer animation is from the 90s, it is very effectively combined with combat footage to present a powerful and clear understanding of each engagement. The necessary background conflicts that lead up to each major battle provide a comprehensive view of the war in Europe and Africa. The Pacific War is not extensively covered but the great naval battles of Midway and Leyte Gulf are included in one set. The narration by Tim Piggot Smith is superb and not overly theatrical. I just read ""The Storm of War"" by Andrew Roberts. It makes an excellent compliment to this series.",1312156800,,1072,4.768817204301075

4228596,1,B003YE4514,"Upon recieving this Blue Ray disc and watching it, I found out that none of the WWII footage was transformed to Hi-Def, only the maps were of high quality.  And since most of the program was WWII footage, I was very dissapointed.  The only reason I bought this was because it claimed to be Blue Ray quality.  To me, this is false advertising.  Shame on you.",1307491200,4,357,4.363636363636363
4228597,4,B003YE4514,"If you have watched a lot of PBS or have an interest in history as I have then you are probably familiar with this series. This set takes three episodes from the series: The Battle for North Africa / Italy and The Battle of Normandy. All 3 episodes are on 1 BD vs. 3 SD-DVD. The episodes run in two parts (except The Battle of Normandy) and each part is about 2 hours in length. This series is a comprehensive narrative and follows the same format as Victory At Sea which uses one narrator and combat footage; but more importantly, no interviews. One way this series splits from Victory at Sea is its constant use of maps showing the area in detail. The graphics along with the maps add to the understanding of what it took to gain the upper hand over Germany. The Battle of North Africa deals with the US and Britain trying to gain a foothold on the German occupied continent. Once the allies do they rapidly sweep across the continent pushing ever close to Egypt and the vital Suez Canal. The Battle of Italy tells us how difficult and different the terrain was as compared to North Africa. In fact once the Italians surrendered the Germans came in and gave the Americans and British fits as we tried to secure Italy. Well what else can be said about The Battle of Normandy that hasn't already been said? Here like the maps really add to the understanding. Here is a typical outline of the format that the series uses from Wikipedia: Prelude to Battle / Order of Battle / The Leaders / Strategy for Offense / Strategy for Defense / The Commanders / The Opposing Forces / Weapons / The Men / The Eve of Battle / The Battle, several Phases / The Battle Won / After the Battle. For anyone interested in WWII this is a very good series and gives the viewer a most detailed look at the battles without getting bogged down and stuck in the mud as some series do. It would have been nice if the company that released this would have splurged a little and given us a DTS HD Master Audio or a 7.1 audio track. But unlike Victory At Sea on blu-ray this blu-ray looks crisp and clean using black and white / color film. Remember the other discs available on this set follows the same format so this review could probably reflect the other shows as well. Beware; some series in this entire Battlefield collection don't always have the introduction of the second part available (example: The Battle of Midway not on this set). I don't know why it's missing because I have the original video tape from the series that aired on my local PBS series. So whoever put this together could have done and find the missing parts I should think.",1300233600,10,2623,4.410309278350516
4228598,5,B003YE4514,"Having originally recorded this series on VHS back in the mid 1990s I had tried for years to find a copy on DVD.  When I found it a few years back I had to order it from the U.K. and play it on a PAL DVD Player.  Thankfully it has been finally formatted to Region 1 and repackaged in this new series for US viewers.

This is one of the most comprehensive series for fans of military history and it presents these great battles at both a strategic and tactical level.  It is one of the few programs, especially when it was originally produced 15 years ago, that provided simple, yet clear graphics to explain troop levels and deployments to a great level of detail.  Each episode is self contained providing significant coverage of the events preceding the specific battle and if you watch several episodes you will therefore have a fair amount of overlap.

I appreciate the style of the program which uses only narration, music, archive footage (often edited at a quick pace) and graphics. I especially enjoy the episodes which Tim-Piggot Smith narrated. Unlike other programs there are no interviews or sound bites of either renowned figures (like The World at War) or of average soldiers who participated.  The approach can be summed up in a word as ""academic"", a word that would often make me shy away from a program but in this case I think is very true.

I only hope the episodes from later parts of the series will also be converted and available for purchase.",1300147200,,1466,4.568702290076335
4228599,5,B003YE4514,"Whether you're a WWII buff, or just a fan of military history in general, you absolutely have to buy this, along with the other three Battlefield sets.  These are the original documentaries broadcast on PBS back in the mid-90's, they were great then and still hold up today.  Each disk is the story of a different battle, taking you through the prelude, the men in charge, the equipment, the battle itself, and finally the aftermath.  There are no interviews as the purpose is to give you the over all strategic view of the fight.  The film footage is from the actual battles, and not just generic battle footage like so many other documentaries show.  Brilliantly put together, these are hands down the best documentaries on the actual battles of WWII ever made.",1288224000,30,763,4.75
4228600,2,B003YE4514,"Didn't even watch this. after being extremely bored and going to sleep during "" Great European Battles of WWII "" and an exceptionally dissa pointing "" Battfield Russia """,1449014400,,169,4.862068965517241
4228601,5,B003YE4514,"The Battlefield series is a great documentary  on WWII . Each of the battles described is detailed with footage and explanation on why the battle was fought, and why the battle was lost and won. I would recommend for any WWII enthusiast .",1447459200,,238,4.534883720930233

4228604,3,B003YE4514,"Interesting but incomplete, not enough facts.  Maps could have more place names and better reference points to ascertain how a particular action relates to the surrounding locals and or other  actions.  If you are a war buff or into history, this series may be good to have, but I don't think it is a must have.  Note:  Sometimes very graphic . . .  Not for youngsters.",1434672000,,369,4.515151515151516
4228605,5,B003YE4514,Any and all of the Battlefield series are fantastic.  Great action films plus the added bonus of viewing the actual battle-plans for both sides of the war!,1431302400,,155,4.7407407407407405
4228606,5,B003YE4514,"There are 3 or 4 of these and I really like them. They present the information to you clearly and there's much more information than I have usually seen in my WWII collections. They run it down, almost like they're teaching a class. They start at the top, giving info on the country/leader, then the commanders and the army they command, they also describe some of the pertinent and important weapons of each side.  They go into details that I've not seen anywhere else.

I'm very happy and have already watched this 3 or 4 times.",1421884800,4,530,4.510416666666667

4228611,5,B003YE4514,"Love this old PBS (or is it British?) WW2 series.  3 two hour episodes about the campaigns to take back North Africa, Italy and Normandy from the Axis.  Well detailed with an hour set up and then analysis of the battle.  For those into the strictly military side of this, not for those looking for how the average soldier felt or what the homefront thought.",1386201600,,357,4.461538461538462

4228615,5,B003YE4514,"These dvds follow the painful path the us army traveled to become an elite force.  The american forces were looked down on, by their enemies, and their allies.  The african war showed our inexperience and what we needed to become effective  fighters.  The italian campaign helped to refine our experience and our skills.  The normandy landings showed how far we had come from the north african war.  The us forces in the torch landings could never have stormed the beaches at normandy.  They performed their tasks with considerable skill and bravery, the american lives lost on these beaches ensured victory for the allies.  JRV",1365292800,,628,4.971153846153846
4228616,5,B003YE4514,Even though this is in black and white I feel that blue-ray makes the smaller details clearer. I do not quite understand the technology but I would recommend this format and the Battlefield series to any collector.,1363564800,,214,4.8108108108108105
4228617,5,B003YE4514,"This is one of the most important television documentaries about the Second World War ever produced. Unlike other series, such as ""The World at War"", there are no interviews with either historians or participants and no descriptions of small-scale engagements, just the hard strategic facts of the engagement as seen by the top leaders. A considerable part of each film describes the run-up to the actual battle, with considerable use of maps, descriptions of the leaders, the commanders, the armies and the weapons that decided the engagement. What is emphasized is the importance of the battle within the whole strategic picture of the war. After this, a detailed presentation of how the battle played itself out is given. Finally, the strategic results of the engagement is described,
showing how the entire course of the war was affected.
This series is designed for someone who has more than just a casual interest in the history of the war, and I highly recommend it for this audience.

I particularly found the film about the Battle of Italy to be very informative, giving a lot of information about this campaign which is not so well known due to the fact that  many people view it as a sideshow compared to the titanic clashes that occurred on the Eastern Front and in the West after Operation Overlord.",1352592000,3,1312,4.878923766816143
4228618,3,B003YE4514,"I purchased this DVD and other titles in the ""Battlefield"" series because of the quality of maps that are thoughtfully integrated into the narration.  This DVD contains a BBC thorough overview of the Battle of North Africa, Battle of Italy and the Battle of Normandy.  The three programs were produced in the 1990s, and the combat footage hasn't been refurbished into HD, although the blu-ray is clear and sharp. My quarrel with the series could use even more maps to detail the deployment of fighting forces.",1343433600,,509,4.906976744186046
4228619,5,B003YE4514,"My boyfriend loved this series. Although he has seen numerous documentaries about WWII, this volume still surprised him. The amount of detail presented for each battle is handled very well. All too often, such information is left out during class lectures and documentaries. It's good to know that this knowledge is available to view and review. I look forward to purchasing more of Battlefield.",1326931200,4,395,5.1875
