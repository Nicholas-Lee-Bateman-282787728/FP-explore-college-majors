8746582,2,B01A69PDGU,"The movie was nicely shot but the plot was confusing.
At times I was lost as to what was actually going on.
At times I was bored due to the slow pace.
I read reviews saying it was ""gay coming of age"" crossed with ""mysterious thriller""....It think one or the other at 100% would have been preferable.
Torn between 2 vs 3 stars.  Would go with 2 Stars.",1499817600,,350,4.147058823529412

8746584,1,B01A69PDGU,Waste of money. Very peculiar film. The entire plot makes no sense. A lot of the movie is filmed on a garbage dump. This movie should be in there too.,1475884800,,150,4.033333333333333

8746587,5,B01A69PDGU,"a movie with actual plot, characterization and good acting!!
there's a touch of the surreal in this well made and beautifully shot film, though not as obvious as movies like pans labyrinth or sucker punch with all those flashy special effects. in this case it makes it harder to detect the differences between real and dream, natural and supernatural because it all blurs together. this isn't a movie with easy answers, you actually have to use your brain to try and figure out whats going on, and even after its over, you still wonder a little.
i really liked this movie, which touches on several different genres, and i enjoyed trying to figure out the symbolism inherent in it. if your looking for an action flick or horror or even just a strait up BL movie with lots of groping than this isn't for you.
if your looking for a movie that will make you think, then give it a try.",1463961600,3,880,4.472049689440993
