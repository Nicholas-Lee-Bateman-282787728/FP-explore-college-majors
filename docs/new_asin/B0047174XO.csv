8417631,5,B0047174XO,"Guro Spezzano has done it once again. This follow-up to Vol. One is terrific. I hope she continues to produce instructional DVD's of this quality. She has truly raised the bar for what an instructional martial arts DVD should be.

These are available from the Inosanto Academy and other sites for $45.00. No need to pay triple that on Amazon.",1315612800,,342,4.7

8417633,5,B0047174XO,"I cannot rate this highly enough. I have had the pleasure of training personally with both Guro Suzanne and John and they are definately the real deal!
This DVD and the first one is one of the best tutorial DVD's I have seen. The material is clear and informative with step by step explanations. Suzanne breaks each technique down so it is very easy to follow.
Buy this now and be inspired!!
