The film starts with four kids out on a birthday celebration. One of the youngsters is your archetypical Bad Girl, except dialed up to an absurd degree. Because of her over-the-top shenanigans, they end up in a car chase that causes an interaction with our titular Butcher Boys. These guys, it turns out, are urban cannibals. What follows is a confusing tangle of chase scenes, some ludicrously eccentric scenes designed specifically to remind you of Texas Chainsaw Massacre (right down to its own Leatherface clone), and attempts at humor that are so ridiculous that they are far more confusing than funny.

There's a lot missing here, and it's more than just coherency. First of all, the movie has no idea what kind of point it wants to make. The film has the gall to actually begin by a quote from Swift's ""A Modest Proposal,"" which is like a porno quoting Dickens in the opening credits. There are half-hearted stabs at moralizing over urban decay, class divisions, and family loyalty, but they're rendered moot by the complete stupidity of the script and acting. Our Butcher Boys are meant to be a gruesome, unstoppable cadre of inhuman fiends, but they mostly look like freshly-oiled Gap models, and their smoldering looks and glowering faces remind one more of an underwear ad than danger or horror. When the movie does get gross and flies off the rails, the shock value helps propel the story past its own treadmill of idiocy, but it doesn't last long and is an empty thrill.

Poor filming, poor framing, and cheaply done effects (get a load of the ridiculous and awkwardly edited nudity near the start), are the final nail in the coffin of this dead-on-arrival movie.",1383264000,10,2515,5.903846153846154

5906488,5,B00EE6ICIS,"Woww! what a film, it is a real surreal experience, packed with scenes reminiscent of Texas chainsaw massacre, Bad boys, Sometimes they come back, and Alice in Wonderland. It is really well filmed and had really great acting. The storyline was simply warped, demented and over the top and jumped back and forth so much that it was hard to keep a train of thought. As for a quick review of the storyline this film is about a family of demented vampires who kidnap and torture local teenagers. A lot of the scary scenes were very much like the TCM, and had the same chainsaw scenes. One scene had a girl being examined (am sure that some film footage hit the floor) for her ability to bear kids... but it was never fully explained if she was to be used to continue the vampire bloodline. Then she is redressed in a red dress (why the fasination with red dresses) and slippers that she wears the remainder of the film. the filming was top notch and most of the filming took place in an abandoned factory,and nightclub. There were several breast flashes, but not enough to be considered exploitative, but a little more lovemaking/sexiness would have made a better story. Overall both guys and gals would like this film, even though it was really hard to watch and almost impossible to make any sense of.",1381449600,3,1299,4.555555555555555
5906489,4,B00EE6ICIS,"""Butcher Boys"" has a tough road ahead of it. Thanks to its writer and producer, the movie will inevitably be compared to ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" as soon as the opening credits start to roll. It's unfair and a shame, because the movie once entitled ""Boneboys"" actually isn't a bad little independent horror piece.

Four friends are out on the town for a birthday celebration. After provoking a couple troublemakers, the group get into a high-speed chase through a bad part of the city. They drive up on a gang hanging out in the street, causing a wreck that kills the dog of one of the thugs. Little do they know that their actions have brought them into the world of a cannibalistic band of psychopaths bent on making them their next meal.

Kim Henkel is probably best known as the producer and writer of the original ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."" After the runaway success of that film, he wrote a script for a sequel which was never used. What do you do with a script that never saw the light of day, but you spent hours of time writing? You turn it into something else!

If you're in the know about the history of where ""Butcher Boys"" came from, then you can't help but draw comparisons to ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."" There are many elements and characters in the movie which you can see were slightly altered to change them into something else. However, it's hard to call a movie a rip-off when it was written by the guy who helped make the original that influenced it.

Duane Graves and Justin Meeks are master craftsmen at creating low-budget films that look fabulous and feel genuine. If you haven't already seen ""The Wild Man of the Navidad,"" you need to do yourself a favor and do so right away. No matter what anyone thinks about the actual storyline of ""Butcher Boys,"" they have to admit it looks good. Graves and Meeks work with the cameraman to establish a voyeuristic feeling that makes you feel like you're running right alongside the poor kids being hunted down in this nerve-wracking movie.

Can you really blame Graves and Meeks for doing the film? If you were an independent filmmaker and the guy who wrote and produced ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" approached you to do his next movie, would YOU tell him no? Yeah, I didn't think so.

I don't believe any rating has been given to ""Butcher Boys,"" but I would certify it ""R."" There's plenty of foul language, some nudity, sexual content, and a healthy dose of cannibalistic gore. As usual, I felt the nudity was a bit much and unnecessary.

""Butcher Boys"" isn't breaking any new ground. I don't really think it was trying to in the first place. It feels like Kim Henkel wanted audiences to see his version of Jonathan Swift's ""A Modest Proposal"" and took his un-filmed ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" sequel and mashed them together. If taken for what it is, most horror fans will enjoy the ride.",1379721600,5,2868,4.6117647058823525

Just as you think you've got your head wrapped around the plot, though, the lunacy begins to escalate and every scene becomes more and more sinister and outrageous than the preceding one until the madness reaches a screeching crescendo in which the insanity breaks out of the building altogether.

5906534,2,B00EE6ICIS,"Butchers Boys had potential in the first half, but laughably the movie either intentionally or unintentionally turns into a comedy (and not the good kind either).  I was wondering why the description said ""comedy/horror"" even though it wasn't trying to be funny, and now I know why!

The first half is mostly about the teenagers running through abandoned buildings and city streets of a rundown city late at night from hungry, smooth-haired cannibals that all resemble John Travolta from Grease which is hilarious itself because nobody pictures cannibals to look like *that*, lol.  Some of this is remarkably graphic at least- these cannibals don't even care about building suspense or anything else that makes a good horror.  They just go ahead, approach the teen boys, smack 'em around and kick 'em when they're down (and nearly beat them to death).

They take their time with the girls and often play with them, enabling them to escape for a short while, and by the way the one girl (Tory Taranova) who kept calling people (specifically her one male friend/boyfriend) the P word all because he's a little cowardly and weak HAS to be one of the most annoying female actresses in the history of movie writing.  I mean seriously.  Give her more lines besides one-word repetitive insults!

Anyway the movie begins with the annoying girl I mention above entering a convenience store (or gas station) and asking for ecstasy.  The two men working the store take exception to something she said, and wind up chasing after Tory and her friends in a car until they end up coming across the cannibals on a backstreet.

Now what makes this movie really horrible is that in the second half, main character Ali Faulkner miraculously escapes danger time and time again either by running away on the streets, hiding in well-protected spots that the cannibals can't get to, or simply lucking out and avoiding cannibal attacks so she can't be caught.  She even meets a suspicious older man who offers protection.  The other punks around town want nothing to do with the cannibals either so they tuck their tails between their legs and run whenever they feel threatened.

But this movie clearly goes towards a comedic direction when not only do the cannibals stop targeting Ali so the plot disrespects and ignores the entire first half, but she actually finds herself hanging around the cannibals as they lose interest in harming her.  The scene where she's sitting at a table surrounded by chaos springs to mind.  It's like the cannibals realized they can't kill Ali or can't benefit from killing her in any way, so they might as well give in and let her join in on the fun!  Very strange writing.  Also strange are how the cannibals act more like clumsy costume wearing drunks in the second half after being so intimidating in the first half.

Meh, this film's pretty bad.  I recommend avoiding it.",1442016000,,2884,4.82520325203252

It was all of their fault for getting themselves in this much trouble.  Don't ride in the car with dysfunctional people.

The flesh eaters were so powerful that some cops were afraid of them.  It was apparent that this part of town knew about these cannibals.  They were too arrogant and fearless.

Almost a year ago I set out to find the most disturbing film ever, a single great peak that would rise above all others. Well, you can't quantify movies like you can the height of mountains...what I have found is more like a mountain range. Serbian Film, I Spit On Your Grave, Cannibal Holocaust, these are indisputable Himalayan peaks, but there are others too that rise above: Evil Dead Trap, August Underground, and Butcher Boys. It's not a failure to make a movie that fits with some ideal of ""let's deliver up yet another well made story."" It's an act of pure depravity and carnage, and horror fans ought to love it.

5906538,4,B00EE6ICIS,"Butcher Boys (Duane Graves and Justin Meeks, 2012)

I spend a decent amount of time trolling the bottom of my sorted (by average rating) Netflix queue, looking for those movies that have a horrible rating that are actually pretty good. I've come across a few here and there that are neglected for whatever reason. The Butcher Boys, Texas Chainsaw Massacre writer Kim Henkel's first feature script in eighteen years, is the latest of those. I have no idea what movie the public who rated this movie a collective one and a half stars were watching, but it must not have been Butcher Boys.

Plot: Sissy (Breaking Dawn's Ali Faulkner) is celebrating her seventeenth birthday at a swanky restaurant in Austin, Texas, that's under protest by a band of radical vegetarians. (While I can't tell you why without spoilers, this becomes important later.) When she, her brother Mikey (Dear Sidewalk's Philip Wolf), and their friends Barbie (The Big Picture's Tory Tompkins) and Benny (Hallettsville's Derek Lee Nixon) are on their way home, a series of minor misadventures end up with them crossing paths with the Butcher Boys (also known as the Boneboys, which was the film's original title), who are out for the kind of good time that involves kidnapping random folks and taking them back to the basement of Austin's hottest new restaurant, J. Swift's.

Okay, the movie's main drawback is very easy to point out, and is just as minor as it sounds: this movie contains two of the worst body-double shots in cinema history. If you combine the two, they take up less than a second of screen time, so that can't be what everyone's up in arms about. And the movie certainly does have its reliance on Henkel's older, far better-known script; before I realized Henkel had written it, I was planning on giving them a few snaps up for nailing modern takes on certain classic TCM scenes (the dinner, especially). They still deserve it. There are a few times this feels like what The Texas Chainsaw Massacre would have been like if it had been written as a comedy; given the popularity, if not the quality, of the movie's many sequels (and a remake or two that took that tack), it's not a bad idea. IMDB's trivia section mentions that this was originally Henkel's script for The Texas Chainsaw Massacre II, but he pulled it out and re-worked it with the aim of turning The Butcher Boys into a new franchise. That, too, is deserved; given a little time and room to grow, this might grow away from its ancestor and become something even better than it is now. It's still singing in someone else's voice, but the lyrics are pretty darn good so far. *** ",1408492800,2,2629,4.708695652173913
5906539,2,B00EE6ICIS,"If you mixed Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Hostel, House of A 1000 Corpses,with a splash of a vampire flavoring, and then a hint of  B-rating then this is what would create Butcher Boys. The beginning of the movie started off strong, but it finished off slow.
SPOILER ALERT. What irritated me the most was the ending. It was an absolute rip off of Texas Chainsaw Massacre (crazy man running behind female victim slashing her back with a razor, then a vehicle comes along, and girl jumps inside). I think this was the bullet that killed this film for me. Yes, throughout the movie it had scenes, which spoofed the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, such as the scene with the girl by table, with men standing around her (ONE man in a dress), and big dumb brut in the corner growling. This didn't bother me as much as the obvious full on rip off of the TCM movie scene at the end of the film.
As for it mirroring Hostel, no it wasn't as gory, but it was that similar theme of a victim being trapped in an environment where people go, and pay to cause suffering to others (Hostel= kill for fun, Butcher Boys= kill for food).
As for mirroring a vampire style movie????? No it was not about vampires, but instead, cannibals. The cannibals wore black, were good looking (most of them), and had super human strength, due to eating human flesh.
The movie even had bizzar moments, which didn't add up to making the movie scary, or disturbing...only a ""what?""
One good thing about this film was that most of the acting was good/ believable.
Another flaw was that the surviving female's friends, I feel were killed off too fast. The director should have prolonged a few of the deaths...not just the slutty girl's demise.
The movie does have it's tense moments, but I'll be honesty, I fast forwarded a lot of the chase scenes...too long winded.",1408320000,,1817,4.556574923547401

5906541,1,B00EE6ICIS,"This movie is an attempted homage to a Texas Chainsaw Massacre. And I have to strongly stress the 'attempted' part of that sentence.

So let me get right to it, this film is a disaster. After watching the first twenty minutes, I asked myself ""how is this movie going to fill up another 70 minutes""? Well, I found out quite quickly. It's filled with the same disjointed, non-logical BS that occurred in the first twenty!

Here is a short list of the idiocy the viewer can expect:
1. Rewind worthy and completely laughable boob shots that were obviously a body double. Not to mention, they seemed to be edited into the film as a complete after-thought.
2. Dialogue that will force you to turn on Closed Captioning just to make sure you heard the line correctly. And you'll sadly find out, yes, that was what the actor actually said.
3. Characters with the depth of a sheet of paper. Seriously. If you're looking for character development and/or backstory, you're going to need to look somewhere else. Some of the protagonists include, a lubed up uncle, a bevy of (*shrug*) random inbred cannibals, bums that are toting purebred pooches, and a fearless slut ready to dish out some BJ's apparently (You'll understand if you can make it that far).
4. Casting that consisted of picking names and roles out of a hat.

I could go on and on, but why bother? I figure it might be quicker to write what was good about the movie. So here is a short list about the positives:
1. The production value is surprisingly good. But I guess even cell phones have picture stabilization and high definition nowadays!
2. You will get a laugh out of it. I can't say the comedy is intentional, but you will undoubtedly laugh multiple times.

So that's it..... This movie is 2 stars at BEST (if only for its comedic value) and if you found that the first 20 minutes were hard to take, then TRUST ME, do not waste your time on the other 70.",1395360000,,1913,4.504322766570605
5906542,1,B00EE6ICIS,"The question is - How fast can you get through this mess of a movie.
I don't normally write reviews, but this film sucks!! Plain and simple. Anybody who gave it more than 1 star must either be.... friends with the director - or extremely high. The only reason why you see one star in my review, and not zero is because zero was not an option.
Here are a few words to describe this movie...annoying; slow & plodding; horrible; disjointed; incoherent; sloppy; and stupid. I'm sure I left out a few.
Bottom line - the filmakers who made this had no clue on pacing or how to construct a scene. Most of the scenes don't connect or make much sense. The viewer is left wondering what the heck is going on??
Plot (or lack thereof) is about a group of 4 kids who somehow end up in a very bad part of town (somewhere around San Antonio). They run across a gang of cannibals who look like a bunch of greasers from The Lords of Flatbush. The kids make all kinds of mistakes as they try to escape the area, and eventually one poor girl is left to fend off these people.
Many nasty characters are introduced, but we really have no clue what their motive is for this girl. Are they going to rape her? eat her? serve her to some other cannibals?? Don't know - never really explained. ??
Does not really matter because after about 20 minutes of this movie, you simply want to fast forward to the end.

Speaking of the end  - it gets really messy (and not in a good violent way) - simply put....all hell breaks loose...cannibals running through the streets killing people with machine guns, rocket launchers, knifes, etc.... totally ridiculous!!!
Misc other things that made no sense....a guy who rubs crisco all over his body so he can slide away through various vents & tunnels? The lone girl is able to escape from the cannibals fairly easily...multiple times?? One girl is intent on showing her boobs several times in the movie...but it must have been a stunt double on those breast shots because they are extreme close ups?? Two of the canniblas seem to constantly be fighting with each other - but we never really know why?? and on and on...and on...you get the idea. Stay away from this one.

There wasn't much gore in it but some blood and a few minor effects that were done pretty well. They used the route that many films that don't have a big enough budget for elaborate effects use. What you don't see and imagine can be much worse than what is really happening.

One of the last scenes in the third act was very reminiscent of TCM so was the big dinner table full of freaks.but this film in no way is as good or will be remembered like TCM.

5906544,3,B00EE6ICIS,"Kim Henkel the writer and producer of Butcher Boys is the writer of the original version of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and the writer/director of the underrated Texas Chainsaw: The Next Generation--and he hasn't done a whole lot else.  Given his history, then, it's not exactly a surprise that Butcher Boys deals with cannibalism.

Basically Butcher Boys reimagines the inbred redneck cannibals of Texas Chainsaw as an urban street gang.  For some reason they are 1950's style greasers, which kind of makes it hard to take them seriously even when they are killing people--but Butcher Boys makes up for that, up to a point, by being far more accomplished and strange than your average straight to video horror flick.

There are occasional witty touches--you know how some people prefer their beef to be grass fed?  Well the cannibals really appreciate when their victims are vegan.  Then there's the cannibal version of veal...

The fact that Butcher Boys is basically a Texas Chainsaw wannabe becomes very obvious once the cannibal gang captures our vegan heroine and brings her back to their lair.  Once there we are treated to both an unspeaking leatherface type character who is chained up because he is so dangerous and a dinner table scene that can't quite match the craziness of the equivalent one in Texas Chainsaw, but not from lack of trying.

Unfortunately directors Duane Graves and Justin Meeks really don't have the same kind of flair for this type of material that Tobe Hooper did--you never really feel the crazy like you did in Texas Chainsaw or Eaten Alive (which Henkel also co-wrote)--the movie just never builds up the fevered intensity necessary for the material to come alive--but it is fun and amusing and, compared to much the bland crap that passes for horror these days--genuinely odd.

In this film the J.Swift society captures and kidnaps people for eating and for implanting fertilized eggs in order to develop a fetal delicacy.

Sissy (Ali Faulkner) and her friends unfortunately encounter this group and must fight for their lives. The film obeys the rules of Latin satires by patterning itself after an existing film (TCM). What was unfortunate is that the point of the satirical metaphor is lost in the film. Yes there were the subtle references to Yahoos, but there needed to be more exquisite dining scenes and less scenes of grunting individuals.

5906548,1,B00EE6ICIS,"It's called a roller coaster ride of encounters with weird people with ""bad"" behavior but I would call it a broken coaster that goes nowhere.  A series of disjointed scenes that don't make a story. Four partying people end up upsetting a bunch of hoodies who end up chasing them for not much of a reason (really implausible) and punch/kick the two of the four to the afterlife. The two survivors (females of course) run through the streets trying to escape (we know that's not going to happen) and end up hiding in a building where more implausibly weird stuff is going on. No acting and those credited have resumes filled with D level cheap horror flicks. Production credits include ""Two Hardheads, Inc."", ""Boneboys, Inc."" - not kidding.
I will say this movie challenges my third grade education which at least got me to ff through 3/4ths of this mess.",1383782400,3,853,4.6866666666666665
5906549,3,B00EE6ICIS,If you like horror movies with lots of gore this is a pretty decent flick that moves along nicely. A lot of it is derivative of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre but it is better than the many sequels and remakes of that film. Some parts are stupid but overall it is decent.,1383696000,6,277,4.245283018867925

8604537,2,B00EE6ICIS,"This isn't the movie to watch before heading to San Antone for a little getaway. Writer Kim Henkel and directors Duane Graves and Justin Meeks seem to have every intention of aping Rob Zombie's first movies and paying homage to THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE and Herschel Gordon Lewis gorefests with BUTCHER BOYS, but they're not quite up to that level yet as filmmakers. This definitely falls into the same ""family of sick villains"" horror as some of the titles mentioned above, where innocent teens suddenly find themselves in the wrong part of Texas with the wrong sort of people. These ""people"" are sadistic flesh-eaters and -manipulators ... so ghastly that the experienced San Antonio cops know to leave them alone (if you can believe that).

Look, it's all been done before, and better. But BUTCHER BOYS does indeed somehow keep you watching, especially as it devolves further and further into madness, and climaxing with the murderous cast of baddies spilling out from their subterranean depths and out into the streets, firing weapons (including a bazooka) and hacking away at a crowd, who -- get this -- have gathered outside their headquarters to watch a suicide jumper. An insane movie for insane times.",1483315200,,1213,4.975369458128079
