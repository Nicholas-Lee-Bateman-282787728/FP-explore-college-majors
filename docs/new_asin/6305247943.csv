7885871,5,6305247943,I had the set six VHS tapes but wanted to convert to DVD. Surprised to find all on one DVD.,1485648000,,91,3.6
7885872,3,6305247943,"Don't get me wrong, this DVD set is awesome for railroad fans!!!!
But this DVD set only presents the footages as they are. There is no detailed introduction to each of the locomotives appeared in the DVDs. I think it'll be much more fun if detailed narration is available.
5 stars for the footage.
3 stars for the DVD set.",1077840000,5,322,4.383333333333334
7885873,4,6305247943,"We want to tell you how pleased we are with the video. The videography is excellent and the shot selection is outstanding. And the Adirondack Southern facility is, we're sure, the envy of many live steam clubs. It certainly gives we Cinder Sniffers something to strive for. Our compliments to all involved in the production of the video. We enjoyed the tape and will share it with our live steam friends.",1015977600,,404,4.704225352112676
7885874,5,6305247943,"I ordered this DVD set primarily for my young son who knows steam trains only through pictures and is passionate about trains in general.  I did not expect to like it myself.  Imagine my surprise when I found the color film footage (from various amateur but dedicated sources) to be in excellent shape, in good focus, and fascinating to watch.  Each disc is a compilation of many different steam locomotives, including those still in regular service during the 1950s and 60s.  (In the U.S., steam engines were completely replaced by diesels by about 1962, a process that began in the late 1930s.)  Locomotives featured range from Union Pacific ""Big Boys"", at 1.25 million pounds the largest steam engines ever built, running on the praire in Wyoming, to N&W articulateds in Virginia, to steam fan trips of the 50s and 60s.  On the disc titled ""Steam Giants Across America,"" some fantastic modern film footage from the 1990s depicts the last remaining articulated N&W engine running on a fan trip in South Georgia and UP fan trips through the Feather River Canyon using their last two big steam locomotives.  I highly recommend this set to anyone who is even mildly interested in the steam era of railroading in America.  Each disc contains 40-60 minutes, and is a bargain at the price.",1006646400,8,1285,4.835616438356165
7885875,4,6305247943,"This set contains 3 DVDs: 'Steam Giants Across America', '50's and 60's' and 'Twilight of Steam'. 'Steam Giants Across America' covers steam action mainly with UP BigBoys and Challengers. All color 16mm footage with some footage from vintage UP promotional films. '50's and 60's' covers classic railroads and excursion steam. Last, but not least, 'Twilight of Steam' covers Norfolk and Western Steam in it's last days as well as other railroads and their massive engines. There is no duplicate footage among the 3 DVDs and they are all color, mostly 16mm and some standard video of the more recent excursion trains. No annoying banjo music either, so you can listen to the sounds of steam without any interruption. The 'bonus' material is not much of a bonus, just a few paragraphs on some famous trains and robberies. The trivia is worth ignoring.",996451200,20,848,4.97887323943662
