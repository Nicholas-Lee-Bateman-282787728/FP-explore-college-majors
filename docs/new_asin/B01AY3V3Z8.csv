7613991,5,B01AY3V3Z8,Nothing better than Call the Midwife and over joyed to find the entire series,1484611200,,77,4.571428571428571
7613992,5,B01AY3V3Z8,"Enjoyed this series on PBS and now love that I have to give my daughter-in-law as a gift for Christmas. She is a former labour and delivery nurse, helping deliver thousands of babies, but in much safer, cleaner conditions. Excited to share and binge watch all these episodes with her this holiday season!",1478649600,2,304,4.754716981132075
7613993,5,B01AY3V3Z8,"Incredible show, set in the late 50s through early 60s in London's East End and based on the memoirs of Jennifer Worth. However I think there were very few episodes that I was able to get through without bursting into tears or sobbing like a child. Keep your box of Kleenex handy because interspersed with the good times and laughter there will be an awful lot of tears. This show touches on everything from poverty to thalidomide babies. It goes from heart warming to heartbreaking on the turn of a dime. I am addicted to this show.",1477699200,,533,4.505154639175258

7613995,5,B01AY3V3Z8,"I binge-watched this over Labor Day weekend. 77 babies born in the course of the 5 series! It's a wonderful look not only at life, birth, and death in London's East End in the late 1950s and early '60s, but an interesting look at the implementation of the NHS in this poor community. There's something in every other episode that will make you cry. It's a Region 2 issued set, but all the discs played nicely in my region-free DVD player.",1474848000,2,438,4.419753086419753

7613998,4,B01AY3V3Z8,Be careful about ordering this one.  I had to change my region from the US to the UK in order to view this set of videos.  You would think that being sold in the US that it would be set for the appropriate region.,1505520000,,213,3.8181818181818183

7614004,1,B01AY3V3Z8,"Less than one star, would no play on my DVD player, made for a overseas player, was able to get a refund.  Amazon did not advertise the type of player needed.  False advertising. Currently ordering blue-ray.",1496966400,,207,4.722222222222222
7614005,1,B01AY3V3Z8,Wouldn't buy. Will not work on out dvd/blue ray machines. Very pissed off right now. Great service. Not sure if they do. To know how to format correctly or if this is just a rare deal. Hope they will fix it,1492992000,2,206,4.048780487804878

7614007,5,B01AY3V3Z8,Love this series. Just received the 5 disc set that said Amazons page said would be Region 2. I bought a $125 region free player to play them. The set is region 1 after all. OK because I can play them on all my sets. I've always wanted a region free player.,1488240000,7,257,3.9615384615384617

8748880,1,B01AY3V3Z8,Wish it had been clear that this set of DVDs won't work on an American DVD system.  Wouldnt you think it would have a note advising buyers of this issue. Now I am stuck with a set of dvds that cant be seen on my DVD player,1525737600,,222,3.723404255319149
8748881,5,B01AY3V3Z8,"Great deal on this set, which plays perfectly in my region-free player (seriously, people, read the descriptions before you buy!). The style of the box set is kind of flimsy, with the book-like ""pages"" for each disc instead of cases, but everything arrived in good shape with no loose dvds or broken plastic. Much better price than the US versions, so I'm happy to have it. Thanks!",1524787200,,381,4.701492537313433

8748883,1,B01AY3V3Z8,"I didn't realize when ordering this you can not use it in the USA.

8748888,1,B01AY3V3Z8,"Was out of town when this was received with two family situations, a birth, a death. When I finally got around to viewing this it said it was not formatted for my DVD player. I have never had that difficulty before and since it wouldn't play I requested a return. It was denied being past the date for returns. Really disappointed, I didn't realize English formatting could be unusable.",1505606400,,386,4.608695652173913
