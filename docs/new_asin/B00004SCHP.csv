8253712,5,B00004SCHP,"The Twitch series of whitewater kayaking videos are known for being jam-packed with fast-paced, in-your-face whitewater action.  The latest in the series, Twitch V, will certainly not disappoint on that front.  Huge waterfalls and gnarly rapids are the cornerstone of this well-produced ride through whitewater's outer limits.

However, Twitch V steps into some uncharted territory for this series and explores deeper, more personal reflections from many of the kayakers.  If you've always wondered what makes people risk their lives to push the boundries of their sport forward, this video is certainly worth buying.  I've watched a ton of ski, snowboard, kayak and mountain biking videos that focus on these most extreme athletes but always come away feeling like I want a greater appreciation for why they do it.  Twitch V definitely satisfies that curiosity.  After watching it I really felt like I had some appreciation for why people feel the need to push themselves to their limits.

If your looking for an instructional video, look elsewhere - this one will show you what only the best and most accomplished in the sport are doing, but that sure makes for quality entertainment!",1142380800,,1186,5.172774869109948

I hope to see many more!  Everyone has been enjoyable, surprising and scary!

I have read what 'Brian Kerecz' tells us, and cannot disagree more.

It is billed as an 'extreme kayaking video', and it is.

Even my (mild) paddling looks like an ""MTV-like foolish descent..."" to non-participants!

The paddlers in this video run huge waterfalls, in remote locations.

How do they find them all?

They are, among others, testing the limits of whitewater kayaking.  The footage is incredible, well filmed and well edited.  The music is good.

The story is excellent, cutting to the kayakers views on various falls (Ben Stokesbury explaining why he got a fall in Argentina wrong, again Ben explaining why Tao Berman running a huge volume fall in the NW was so significant...).  The 'fearless documentary' is a nice insight into someone who kayaks rivers far more extreme than I would ever consider, but it is great to hear why and how he does it.

Overall, the film is easy to watch, full of variety (for an extreme whitewater huckfest - don't expect sheakspear in here) with great input from the paddlers.

I have watched this film (and the others) over and over again, in fact, probably again in a few minutes!  If you are a whitewater paddler, interested in 'meeting and seeing' the people that paddle the drops that you only think about, and gaining an insight into how they think and have ing a great 32 minutes, then you could do little wrong in buying this DVD!",1142380800,2,1508,4.637735849056604
