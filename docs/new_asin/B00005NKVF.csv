1635240,4,B00005NKVF,"First, I must copliment the Broadway Television Network for such a wonderful transfer of ""Jekyll & Hyde"". Having received and watched the DVD, I must say that the sound and picture quality is excellent. I have given this DVD 4 stars for two reasons: The first is that ""Jekyll & Hyde"" isn't my favorite Broadway show. The second reason is that I'm not too thrilled with the chapter setup on the DVD. Act I is one title with one chaper. Act II is the same way. In the future, I would like to see chapters broken up by scenes and songs (as in other DVDs). So, in conclusion, a wonderful start to a wonderful series of DVDs. Let's hope to see more in the future.",996451200,,658,4.272
1635241,3,B00005NKVF,"For all those jekyll and Hyde fans this DVD is a mixed blessing.  Taken from the PBS concert in March, it stars David Hasselhoff.  Now a lot of people bashed Mr. Hasselhoff for being in the show, but without him we wouldnt have this DVD to purchase.  The suporting cast is excellent and Mr Hasselhoff can sometimes hold his own, but for people wanting to see a broadway actor/singer in the lead role, they will be quite disappointed.  It would have been much better if they made a DVD of the road show since some of the better songs have shown up in that production.  The DVD offers nothing in the way of extras that I saw.  But the quality is good and if you love Jekyll and Hyde then buy this DVD.  NOW !",996451200,,706,4.185185185185185
1635242,5,B00005NKVF,Love this DVD! I am watching it often so I'm using it as a research tool for my upcoming performance as Lucy Harris ,1477612800,,116,4.043478260869565

1635246,4,B00005NKVF,"I'm probably not the best person to be reviewing this DVD because the first version of this musical was the concept album with Anthony Warlow and I'm a bit biased on Anthony's performance. He was, by far the best in my opinion. I understand why they changed the very beginning of the play a bit, but I agree that David's performance was a bit stiff.  Voice was ok, but I just thought he was wrong for the part, even though I like him a lot. I'm not sorry that I bought the DVD because I do like the songs, and the story was done well. If you get a chance, listen to the concept album. I think it was fantastic.",1466985600,,610,4.083333333333333
1635247,4,B00005NKVF,"It is darn rare for anybody to record a Broadway show in its original run and I have to thank Hoff for taking the money out of his own pocket so we have a historic memento of a show that is near and dear to many folk's hearts. That aside, his JH has problems. Acting wise, it isn't bad. As to the singing...well..he had the misfortune to follow several good singers in the role. He is not putrid beyond belief but he isn't fantastic either. JH is a murderous role even for a good singer and he tries, but often he comes across as a drowning man screaming for somebody to throw him a lifeline.
Now on to the highlight. Coleen Sexton and Andrea Rivette ARE FANTASTIC. When they open their mouths, nothing else about the show matters. They both shine in their numbers and totally cut loose in ""In His Eyes"", making it the definitive version of the song in my opinion. it sends chills down the spine. Sexton really makes Lucy come alive and her murder at the hands of Hyde is heartbreaking. It is shocking that Sexton and Rivette didn't become bigger stars. They are THAT GOOD. To be honest, I really wasn't that big a fan of the show until I viewed this DVD as research for a coming production. But now I am a fan. Warts and all this is a Broadway DVD worth having. A so-so JH but kept afloat by two powerhouse love interests for the main character.",1463875200,2,1346,4.2823529411764705
1635248,5,B00005NKVF,Love this show. Really hope they'll bring it back to the stage.,1457481600,,63,4.333333333333333

1635260,4,B00005NKVF,Such a Great Depressing Musical! ^_^ Although the hoff wouldn't be my first choice to play the title character. He did a really nice job at switching back and forth. and Of course my ONLY choice for Lucy would have been Linda Eder...the Original Lucy from Bway(also married to Frank Wildhorn composer) Overall it was done very well. And I hope one day to see this production live!,1416787200,,380,4.602941176470588

1635262,1,B00005NKVF,"If I could give this zero stars I would. My daughter and I are huge fans of Broadway and musicals overall; this was perfectly horrid! The storyline was awful - what a disgrace to the novel. The acting was so bad we actually laughed throughout the video.  If this was billed as a comedy, I would have rated it quite high.",1403481600,,320,4.245901639344262

1635264,3,B00005NKVF,"It wasn't ""Phantom of the Opera"" my favorite musical, but it was okay, much better than Anne Hathway's Les Miserables.  The acting was fairly good, the singing was acceptable.",1398384000,,175,5.0344827586206895
1635265,5,B00005NKVF,"This musical is one that is very difficult, music wise. But, it's also so challenging that it's worth watching over and over to get the jist of the show.",1394496000,,153,4.310344827586207
1635266,5,B00005NKVF,I was surprised to have enjoyed this musical as much as I did.  I absolutely would recommend this to anyone looking for a great musical,1394064000,,135,4.4
1635267,5,B00005NKVF,"We have already watched this multiple times. Great production. David Hasselhoff is wonderful in this roll. Professional quality, We are very happy with this purchase. Thank you!",1391817600,,177,5.592592592592593
1635268,3,B00005NKVF,"After seeing the original Broadway Show which could never be topped I wanted to compare.  I must say most of the
cast was excellent.  I thought Hasselhoff gave it his all but he took on one of the hardest rolls on Broadway and struggled.
The original show should have run forever and Linda Eder & Robert Cuccioli could not be topped.
Mama Mia is still running, sad but true.",1389398400,,374,4.405797101449275
1635269,5,B00005NKVF,We had seen a college performance of this musical and were delighted to find this  professional version.  What a great addition to our video library!,1389312000,,149,4.92
1635270,3,B00005NKVF,"I much prefer the original cast of which I have a CD, sadly this is the only recording of this musical, which isn't too popular or around in theatres anymore, so I'm stuck with this version. Still not too bad, plus it's just kind of fun to see David Hasselhoff sing.",1386979200,,266,4.235294117647059
1635271,5,B00005NKVF,This musical is simply breath-taking!!! I love it!! the music is soooooo beautiful and the lyrics are really good! if you are into musicals you should definitely buy it!!!,1384646400,,171,4.931034482758621
1635272,3,B00005NKVF,Who told David Hasselhoff he could sing? But what should I expect from a former Baywatch star? Everyone else was on their game.,1381795200,,127,4.565217391304348

1635274,3,B00005NKVF,But it seems to drag.  I saw the original cast of this show and it was amazing. D H does a good job and it is worth it if you like the show but it seems to be slower than the original!,1369008000,,184,3.380952380952381
1635275,4,B00005NKVF,"The Hoff is central here, so the acting is exactly Hoff-esque. There is a sequence in which Jekyll is transforming into Hyde and back again in the space of time of a few lines (repeatedly) in a song that makes it worth the purchacse.",1367280000,,233,4.318181818181818
1635276,4,B00005NKVF,"I can NEVER find this production, ANYWHERE!  Jekyll and Hyde is one of my favorite musicals, but it's impossible to find a recording of it, aside from this one with David Hasselhoff.  And even THIS version is hard to find.  Enter AMAZON!  :)

It's been years since I've seen this or any version of this production.  And I'm sure for a lot of people Hasselhoff's attachment is a deal breaker, but I say, ""Give it a shot!  Please!""  If you've never seen Jekyll and Hyde, but love Phantom, this is a must see.  It is a stage production that is filmed live.  Hasselhoff is actually NOT awful in it!  And the supporting cast is phenomenal!

Jekyll and Hyde is a dark, gritty musical about malace, hope, redemption, and the dark side of human nature.  And the music is absolutely beautiful!",1358380800,,784,4.514285714285714
1635277,4,B00005NKVF,"Did not get to see original production when released on broadway back in the late ninties so I picked up this dvd so that I could get a chance to see the original production without the high priced ticket cost. The musical itself was very good. Dark and very scary. The murder scenes were brutal. Hyde is most certainly a chracter that I would not want to meet in a dark alley at night. The struggle that the good Dr. Jkyll goes through I think best represents the struggle that man has between his two natures. The good nature and the evil nature that is within all of us. Its so sad for Jkyll in the end. ( I won't spoil it for those who havn't seen this musical.) I loved the music, facade and dangerouse game being my two favorites. Facade I like because it kind of has a dark truth to it. we all wear masks to hide what we truly are. (some more than others.) Dangerouse game I don't know why this song it so good but it just is. Darkly sensual and erotic.
  The acting and singing for this filmed version of the show. Well, let me start off by asking why did they ever cast someone like david hasselhoff? No offense but he cant sing or act. I was cringing through out every time he opened his mouth. He wasn't as bad as some, but I can't stand his voice. The rest of the cast was good and acted very well. The only thig that was hard to get through while watching this show was hasselhoff's voice.",1357257600,,1402,4.150735294117647
1635278,4,B00005NKVF,Got it for a friend as a gift. We were looking everywhere and couldn't find it. Had a great time watching the play.,1356652800,,115,4.043478260869565
1635279,4,B00005NKVF,This is an excellent DVD!  I love Jekyll and Hyde and the way this was from Broadway itself and shot was wonderful!,1356566400,,115,4.2272727272727275
1635280,5,B00005NKVF,I am seeing the live show for my birthday this mouth so I bought the dvd to see what I am in for. OMG this is an amazing story and great music. I was also pleasently surprized by the abilities of Hoff,1351900800,,200,3.7857142857142856
1635281,5,B00005NKVF,"This is such a great broadway play,  I would reccommend this item to others . The story line and music is amazing . I would definately buy from this seller again.",1349395200,,162,4.225806451612903
1635282,5,B00005NKVF,"David Hasselhoff really hits his mark in this musical of the classic novella. Every expectation is fulfilled when watching because of the energy and chemistry between the actors and the story they are telling. The score compliments the scenes and makes the whole production soar. The filmed version is so vibrabt that it is like watching a movie rather than a stage production. The lighting, the sets, and everything else fits perfectly. One word of caution, however, for fans of the book by Robert Louis Stevenson, it has a completely different plotline and Utterson (Jekell's friend) does not serve as a narrator but a supporting character.",1343433600,,642,5.066037735849057
1635283,4,B00005NKVF,I was very pleasantly surprised in how good this production was. My family and I saw the stage production when it came to Sacramento. I was amazed at how well David Hasselhoff performed. His singing was not up to operatic form but he did very well. When he went from Jekyll to Hyde and talked to himself it was amazing. He played an awesome Hyde. I would highly recommend this production and am glad that they performed it and filmed it so there is a dvd of it to watch at home. All the actors were terrific. I thoroughly enjoyed listening to the songs again. It is a wonder that a play can be so effective with a minimal set.,1343088000,,626,4.225
1635284,5,B00005NKVF,"If you're not a big fan of David Hasselhoff, don't worry, he actually does a surprisingly good job. I absolutely love the voice of the Lucy, Colleen Sexton. She's gorgeous, talented, and extremely perfect for the role. I watched this three times in two days after I received it :)",1340755200,,280,4.62
1635285,1,B00005NKVF,"I saw ""Jekyll & Hyde"" several times on Broadway with Linda Eder and Robert Cucciolli. Very enjoyable BUT it takes a fine actor who can pull off Jekyll / Hyde especially when he's having a ""converstaion"" with himself or, rather, the two personalities. Cucciolli was marvellous at this as well as being a fine singer. Hasselhoff has not one iota of talent so why he was filmed in this is beyond me. I recommend the show but not this travesty.",1339804800,2,440,4.5125
1635286,4,B00005NKVF,"The production made available to the public was due, in large part, to Mr. Hasselhoff.  Without his backing, the show would likely not have been produced on DVD at all.  He pushed it and backed it with his own money.  I thank him for that.

Hasselhoff wasn't so bad.  I would bet a group made up of people who had no idea who the Hoff was would not rate the show as badly as a similarly sized group that did know who he was.  Certainly, I don't like his chances in comparison to Rob Evan, but that doesn't automatically make Hasselhoff's performance so bad.

I didn't care for some of his acting or some of his phrasing.  But overall, I think he took on a very difficult role and did it fairly well.  I'm not a ""Hoff"" fan.  I have never particularly liked anything he has ever done.  But I thought he did a decent job here.

His ""The Way Back"" and even ""Confrontation"" are actually very good.  Compare his Confrontation with Rob Evan's from any Youtube video.  Try to ignore the ""Hoff-ness"" or more specifically, your preconception that David Hasselhoff can't play this role.  I DO like Rob Evan, but I find his controntation to be more difficult to watch.  The ""hair ballet"" is an awkward thing to pull off for anyone, and I think Hasselhoff pulled it off better than Rob Evan did.  Ithink the same of their renditions of ""The Way Back"".

Jekyll & Hyde is one of my most favorite shows - and as a specific production, I think the Broadway version is the least favorite of any version anywhere.  I still like it though but might give a rating of 3 stars because the Broadway version is so inferior to others.  But the show is still good overall, and I think it is an enjoyable experience to watch a well-produced video (the only legal copy available), so with the fine performances (Hasselhoff included), I give it 4 stars.",1337299200,,1823,4.4174174174174174
1635287,1,B00005NKVF,"Any one who thinks this is good obviously did not hear the original broadway cast production. This was originally made for Linda Eder and her extraordinary
voice.  And lest we forget, Robert Cuccioli was nominated for a tony for his
portrayal of Jeckyl/Hyde and a voice that is so beautiful and rich that the
hairs on my arm stand up everytime I hear it!  Who, in their right mind could
ever think that Hasselhof should ever have been allowed to ruin this great
production.  My apologies to the rest of the cast!",1335398400,,512,4.543478260869565
1635288,2,B00005NKVF,"I won't go through a long treatise on the shortcomings of this version - other reviewers have done that quite well. I saw the show on tour, and was blown away. The lead on the tour was an actor named Chuck Wagner, who has a HUGE baritone voice.

You can sample and buy his version of ""This is the Moment"" and several other songs from the show here:<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chuck-Wagner/dp/B003A4X6UO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chuck Wagner</a>",1328659200,,488,5.777777777777778
1635289,3,B00005NKVF,"I have seen a few different productions of Jekyll and Hyde, and I must admit that Hasslehoff surprised me a little bit.  The one major problem with his style is that he does not have the range for Jekyll...even then, his voice is little bit high for Hyde.  The worst problem is his very annoying vibrato: it grates on my already horrible hearing.  The rest of the cast does an amazing cast, and it feels like they are carrying him through this entire show.  Confrontation was amazing, except for him adding words right at the end that make no sense.",1327968000,,549,4.46
1635290,3,B00005NKVF,"David Hasselhoff's rendition of ""This is the Moment"" is probably the worst piece of music I have heard in my life.

1635292,2,B00005NKVF,"Do yourself a favour and track down a copy of the bootleg Pro Shot video taken for camera angles of this production. Same camera quality, same technical values, same cast but with the important exception of Hoff's understudy Rob Evan as J/H. He's got a legit lyric baritone, and the improved acting and singing in the central role(s) lift the whole performance to a higher level. By this point, the producers were resorting to stunt casting to sell tickets. While that is understandable and inevitable in this business, the casting and creative teams must have known that this material was just beyond Hoff's abilities and I am certainly surprised that this is the actor they chose to preserve their show for posterity. But then, I'm sure that decision was driven by $$ as well. (Really, though who buys these films of the stage productions other than musical theatre fans? Did they really believe that fans of ""Bay Watch"" and ""Knight Rider"", or perhaps Hoff's international music, were going to drive sales for this dvd into numbers significantly greater than they would have gotten with a stronger but lesser known performer like Evan in the lead? Sounds like the marketing/sales department made this decision. can't believe that Wildhorn, Clemmons, etc. really believe that Hoff is a patch on Evan.)",1307491200,,1302,4.977064220183486
1635293,3,B00005NKVF,"I love Jekyll & Hyde but I feel that this production missed the mark.  The choriography is poorly done and David Hasselhoff was probably the worst casting choice ever.  I had this DVD years ago but lost it in a move and over time forgot why I didn't care that I lost it, now that I've bought it and watched it again...  If you can get past the Hoffs bad acting and singing then the rest of the DVD is enjoyable.  The only other change I would make are some of the camera shots.",1306972800,,477,4.042553191489362
1635294,2,B00005NKVF,"Some of the voices in this production are wonderful; Hasselhoff's, unfortunately, is shaky and thin. But what really disappointed me was the insipidity of the words, melodies, and staging. This musical does not begin to compare with other Broadway shows. I'd rather watch Les Mis again and love it than wince through another viewing of Jekyll.",1302652800,,343,5.142857142857143
1635295,2,B00005NKVF,I really like the show and music....when done with actual musical theater actors. Putting Hoff in just to add a better known name was just a hail Mary to try to keep the show on Broadway. I saw it in 2000 on Broadway. DVD should have been made with less popular names who were much better singers and actors than Hoff.,1300665600,,318,4.229508196721311

It doesn't look like I'll ever have the chance to see the Broadway production so I purchased this version to get an idea of what the show was like. I really enjoyed it. I'm not a huge Hasselhoff fan but think he did an admirable performance in what is a demanding role, for sure. His co-stars and supporting cast are excellent. I really like the music in this show.",1293580800,,474,4.337078651685394
1635297,5,B00005NKVF,This musical is one of my favorite of all time.  The 2 female leads in the show are awesome.  David Hasselhoff is the weakest link in the production.  Still he does an ok job and the rest of the cast make up for him.,1277337600,,216,3.8636363636363638
1635298,5,B00005NKVF,"When Jeckyl and Hyde was on Broadway in NYC, I went to NYC 8 times (from CT) to see it.
I also have to confess that I cried when I heard the show was ending.

This DVD is so terrific ! David Hasselhoff plays Jeckyl and Hyde and altho he can act, he can't sing. However, his performance doesn't detract from the overall DVD experience.

I LOVE the story, the music, the special effects and the superb acting...

Try it....you won't be disappointed.

Just another  ''Jekky''",1260662400,,472,4.441860465116279

1635300,5,B00005NKVF,"Normally I wouldn't buy anything sung by David Hasselhoff.  But, I caught the last 15 minutes and the last showing of Jekyll & Hyde on HBO and was determined to get a copy for myself.  I'm not easily impressed, but David Hasselhoff blew my socks off! No kidding, Knight Rider ala Babe Watch and American Idol is to be commended for his performance in this musical.  His diction is perfect, his range topnotch, his turning into Dr. Jekyll from Mr. Hyde is downright creepy and will give you chills.  The best is towards the end where Dr. Jekyll is attempting to take over the body of Mr. Hyde, and Hasselhoff has to sing a dual part of Jekyll and Hyde at the same time. Not to be missed.  David Hasselhoff is absolutely fabulous in this musical. The entire cast including the set designers are to be commended also. It was fascinating to see what effects could be created with a limited set design.  Really great job! This entire musical is really, really good!",1257206400,,960,4.520231213872832
1635301,4,B00005NKVF,"I was fortunate enough to see the Original Broadway Cast on Broadway with the exception of Robert Cuccioli.  I saw his understudy but have a really hard time believing Cuccioli was better than his understudy.  It was an absolutely amazing performance.  The reason I saw his understudy was that his understudy did all matinee performances because the role of Jekyll/Hyde was so demanding on the voice.  The role requires a big voice and I don't think Hasselhoff had it.  I don't think he destroyed the role.  I just saw better.  This is the only reason I give this a four out of five, instead of five out of five.  They are planning to make a feature movie from Frank Wilhelm's Jekyll & Hyde so it might be worthwhile waiting.  Unfortunately, there is no timeline on when this project might be finished.  They still haven't held auditions.",1241395200,,838,4.678082191780822

The scene in which Hasselhoff has to sing a duet with himself as both Jekyll and Hyde is impressive.  I liked the song ""It's a dangerous game"" with Hyde and Lucy.  I also liked the fact that nearly every actor in the show had a dual role.  Nice touch, that!  All and all, JEKYLL AND HYDE is a pretty good show!",1238630400,,469,4.133333333333334

Everyone says David Hasselhoff can't sing but, I think he can! He really gives it his all and the rest of the cast is AMAZING!! The camera moves around stage to really get up in the face of the actors!

If you have heard the songs and music of Jekyll & Hyde you already know its AMAZING!! ""This Is The Moment, Someone Like You, In His Eyes, Take Me As I Am"" just to name a few. Its all here, all the songs of the amazing broadway show! Forever on a DVD! Buy it Now before its gone!",1231286400,,677,4.082706766917293
1635306,4,B00005NKVF,"In a nutshell....  This DVD is among the best I have seen regarding the quality of the video and audio.  The 5.1 channel sound is very good, with clear definition of the voices.  the video is absolutely stunning on my 42"" plasma, with brilliant lighting and vibrant colors.  Add to that is the filming on stage, showing the actual staging techniques while still allowing good close ups of the performers.

I rate the performers a little lower, but certainly they are adequate.  Hasselhoff is a bit campy at times, and Oh that stringy hair!  But he is not really ""bad"" and the score is strong enough to allow overlooking some aspects of his performance, ton which he certainly gives his all.

I liked the remaining cast members. Both ladies have good voices. I felt that ""Lucy"" was a little too perfect looking for a prostitute... she looked too much like a prep school beauty to me.  Again a minor issue.

The after show antics by Hasselhoff after the curtain calls were distracting to me... completely broke the residual ""mood"" of the show.  All in all, a well done and enjoyable production with a flavor of a ""real"" Broadway show.",1224806400,,1132,4.63819095477387

For this production the right person was cast, his voice not perfect in every song, was a good musical play voice. He carried the role very well. I was impressed, my lady friend said "" I have changed my mind about Hasselhoff"". My feelings were the same. He sang well, he had good stage presense. He fit the role well. The songs are great and for most part, his supporting cast was good. Have watched the DVD three times, and enjoyed three times. I was happy that they filmed it as play, and not try to make it into a movie. If Hasselhoff does any other plays in the future, I will go, based on this play. The most diffcult part is when he has to play both parts on stage, he was great!",1219190400,,806,4.2064516129032254

  The show is very spectacular , emotional and dynamic.  The scene of transformation looks like a real transformation  and delivers the idea very well. You can almost believe to the actor, he really changes his appearance and behaviour.

But lets think about the positive. The cast surrounding Hasselhoff was AMAZING!!! Coleen Sexton as Lucy Harris gives Linda Eder a run for her money. Her tone was so much prettier than linda eders diva sound. I will say with full confidence that ""Good and Evil"" and ""Someone like you"" were the best numbers on this dvd. I would definately suggest buying this dvd for those two recordings because they outshined linda eders recordings on all the jekyll and hyde recordings.",1195862400,,629,4.833333333333333

1635312,5,B00005NKVF,"Although Hasselhoff has nothing on Anthony Warlow, Jekyll and Hyde is a real masterpiece. True its music does mimic many previous well know stage musicals but it is still brillant in every sense of the word. Songs like Someone Like You and In His Eyes stand alone as examples of why this musical should not be judge so harshly. Just because it came out after other successes doesn't mean it is attempting to copy them and even if it is it is merely because those shows were hits and who wouldn't want their 'baby' to be a succeed in a pretty harsh business. Clearly it was a big enough success to be on broadway, produced as this dvd and turned into a feature film (coming 2009). So to anyone who hasn't seen the show and wants to see it then WATCH THIS DVD! And the same goes for fans. Until 2009 when the feature film comes out this is a terrific substitute, even if Hasselhoff isn't the greatest Jekyll ever on stage(like I have implied- he did have some tough acts to follow).

Before I finish up let me just add that aside from all this the leading ladies are fabulous in this particular production and worth having a good look and listen to.",1187136000,,1147,4.359813084112149

I was disappointed in David Hasselhoff's performance.  I love the music from Jeckyll and Hyde.  Some of the songs were simply meant for big, strong voices.  Sadly, David's voice is neither big nor strong.  I still recommend the DVD because there is really no other choice and it is worth watching, despite Hasselhoff.  However, if you are not familiar with Jeckyll and Hyde already PLEASE listen to the original cast recording of the show!",1187136000,,608,4.472727272727273

1635316,5,B00005NKVF,"I had to give this version a chance. David Hasselhoff has an incredible singing voice and to give the performance he does in Jekyll and Hyde - The Musical is very impressive. But I admit I was a bit frustrated when I saw him practically pass out during his major schizo song. When that bed came in and he was still walking offstage, you could tell that song took quite a bit out of him.

Colleen Sexton as Lucy Harris. Wow wow wow wow wow! She brought quite a bit to the table, and she was in incredible company with the distinguished performers she shared the stage with including Andrea Rivette as Emma Carew. Sexton's and Rivette's performance of In His Eyes was outstanding. Not better than the original performances that predecessed Hasselhoff, but definitely is a ranking force in it's own. I would rank this second next to the Dream Cast concert of Les Miserables starring Colm Wilkinson as Jean Valjean.

This is the moment. Buy Jekyll and Hyde and give it a chance. You won't be disappointed.",1177200000,,1001,4.58659217877095
1635317,3,B00005NKVF,"Despite much negative opinion, this performance is in many respects not half-bad.  I must confess that a good deal of negative criticism focussed on David Hasselhoff seems a lot more like grudge fulfillment.  Still, others have turned in better performances.  The question is, performances of what?  Aye, there's the rub.

""Jekyll and Hyde"" occupies the musical and dramatic world of ""Phantom of the Opera"" and ""Sweeney Todd"" - without being anywhere as good as either. Dramatically, although the musical follows a fairly single-minded and coherent line, it seems jumpy and fragmented because of the jumpy and fragmented changes of sets. We might go over the plot at this point - except that here we have classic of English literature which ought to be familiar to every person who gets into high school. If you haven't read Stevenson's tale, go read it and don't expect a Cliff's Notes version of it here.

Musically, ""Jekyll and Hyde"" is, in a word, boring. The music gropes in vain to achieve melody but in every instance fall short to one degree or another. The notes meander within traditional tonality, but fail to leave a lasting impression. That some of the numbers achieved a fleeting popularity is more a tribute to marketing than to any inherent musicality. No amount of belting or breathless intensity can give these tuneless tunes any more than an underachieved dramatic impact.

It's not an uncommon opinion that the problem with this version of the musical is that it stars David Hasselhoff. This is, to a large extent, a bum rap. I will admit that comparing the sound track here with the CD of the original Broadway production (starring Robert Cuccioli), there's no doubt that the original version is more satisfying. That doesn't mean that Hasselhoff doesn't turn in a solid performance - he does - nor that he doesn't have moments of chewing up the scenery. In fact, in many respects, Hasselhoff is the best thing about the whole production.

The star invests his rle(s) with sincerity and authenticity. I suspect this gets past some viewers who let themselves get distracted by surfboards and talking cars. This part has been better played and will be better played, but Hasselhoff gives the audience their money's worth nonetheless. He clearly delineates Hyde from Jekyll, although his bag of tricks is rather limited - he sometimes manages a really chilling manic look to Hyde, but not as often as he should. Cuccioli's command of his voice serves him sell in this regard, but Hasselhoff's voice shows little difference between his 2 characters. His singing voice, as it happens, isn't bad. It's certainly up to the singing-in-the-shower sort of voice that we often hear in American musicals.

Hasselhoff's part dominates the musical, so that all the other characters are relatively minor. They are, however, played professionally in all cases, giving Hasselhoff a firm backing. I don't see, however, any one performer to single out as being anything but good-but-not-great.

I have already alluded to the physical presentation of the production. The many sets tend toward darkness rather than brightness. As a continuing factor, this becomes dreary. One wonders why we didn't start with well-lighted sets and gradually move toward darker ones. In addition to the less-than-useful dimness, the frequent set changes make the musical seem fidgety. Fortunately, the musical itself shows a single-minded devotion to its story line and manages - barely - to preserve a sense of unity and linear development.

On the whole, ""Jekyll and Hyde"" is entertaining on one hand and a bit of a chore to watch on the other. It tries very hard to ingratiate itself, succeeds in part, but in the end fails owing to the grisly nature of its development and ending. Nonetheless, it's a fine effort and worth seeing. Even the flaws are instructive.",1173657600,2,3848,5.015673981191223
1635318,5,B00005NKVF,"This is a great performance of a great play, with terrific songs. It has meanings in many levels, and much to stimulate thought about love, duty, addiction, violence and twists of fate, and personal character.",1173657600,2,209,5.0
1635319,3,B00005NKVF,"I was so looking forward to getting this DVD of the show that I had so enjoyed the concept album of. I ordered it in anticipation and it was swiftly delivered to me in England.

A promising start to the presentation with a little SFX to set the tone of the show. This then, after the prologue, descended all too rapidly into mediocrity rather than the spectacular. The sense of scale and epic quality was sadly lost and the small company seemed at times unconvincing and almost timid in their delivery.

A British literary classic was marred by a little too much Americanisation. I will undoubtedly be flayed alive by the American public for saying this, but I have to speak as I find and I am a pompous Brit after all. Again, the International Cast concept album remained faithful to the genre and country of vocal origin of the novel.

David Hasselhoff tried his very best with the complicated role of both Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde. At times however he did show true stage presence with some excellent acting, but he was hopelessly miscast and simply did not have the vocal talent to back it up.

Billy Flynn in Chicago is one thing, but the diversity needed for this performance in both vocality, pitch and change of persona was unfortunately lacking and sometimes cringe-worthy. At times he spent too much time posturing Baywatch-style.

The production was not helped with the mysterious removal of two key and fantastically written 'Jekyll/Hyde' songs: 'I NEED TO KNOW' and 'THE WORLD HAS GONE INSANE' which were again in the original concept album.

You may have now guessed that I am a big fan of the Concept Album, starring the Australian ANTHONY WARLOW, who must be one of, if not THE greatest musical theatre star alive and performing today. Check out the DVD's: THE MAIN EVENT, PATIENCE, HMS PINNAFORE and the CD's: BEST OF ACT ONE, CENTRE STAGE and ON THE BOARD'S. You will NOT be disappointed.

Indeed his return to the lead role of the PHANTOM of the OPERA in MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA due in 2007 has caused a murmur of unparalelled excitement in the theatre world. It was in this show that he rivalled, if not exceeded MICHAEL CRAWFORD in the characterisation of the lead role. This reviewer has been fortunate to have seen both.

The show is not a total loss however with excellent turns by stage and screen veteran BARRIE INGHAM as 'SIR DANVERS' COLEEN SEXTON as 'LUCY' and ANDREA RIVETTE as 'EMMA'. GEORGE MERRITT however was slightly disappointing as 'UTTERSON' who seemed to sing and talk through the whole performance with a plum in his mouth, and was at times barely audible or verbaly understandable.

However, as with all reviews, you really need to judge the show for yourself as this is only the personal opinion of this individual. You may indeed find that without my rose-tinted spectacles and the benefit of not having heard or seen the show before, that you enjoy this production in a whole different light. Then I urge you to also leave your review on this site. That's the infinate beauty of personal preference and opinion.

Although the first 30 minutes is a little slow, it is well worth the wait to see the rest of the show.  David Hasselhoff is fantastic and he performs a number that is quite the show stopper.  In fact, it is probably one of if not the best numbers I have ever seen in all the shows I've attended in New York for the past 40 years.

Be patient with the beginning and then sit back for a truly enjoyable experience.  I was sorry when it ended!",1168300800,4,538,3.8454545454545452

As his first Broadway appearance (and hopefully NOT his last), David Hasselhoff's performance is memorable.  Although his voice seems slightly weak in the beginning, his acting more than compensates for any perceived vocal deficiency.  This is not a production for the faint-hearted.  Mr. Hasselhoff's Edward Hyde is, indeed, a sadistic creature who commits violent murders.  The duet between Jekyll and Hyde is a daring idea, and Mr. Hasselhoff's rendition is brilliant and flawless -- a unique moment in theatre history not likely to be repeated or surpassed!  The supporting cast is quite good, especially the four co-stars.  The DVD bonus prelude provides an opportunity for Mr. Hasselhoff to share interesting behind-the scenes commentary about his role.

First of all I was impressed with the quality of of the video... excellent.

I have read most of the reviews and can see and understand some of the ""dissapointments expressed"" This said , my final analysis is that the production was well done.  Critics must understand that it is a very contraversial story with exceedingly high demands on most of the  actors.

It is a ""Dark"" play ( and a Musical to boot) therefore making it all the more difficult to judge, But all things considered. I feel the entire cast did a magnificent job. David Hasselhoff, although not being the type of ""Vocalist"" the part demands, did a incredible job in all aspects of his hs performance.

The female leads were both talented actress's with excellent vocal qualities.

The viewers must understand the complexity of a story of this nature... there is deciet, murder, cunning science in a time when there was little or no tolerance for the storyline.( All things considered, it is tough to take these components and turn them into a ""Musical""

I am happy to say that I was pleased with my purchase,and I was ""Entertained' completely.

The DVD is not for everyone, but for those who truly enjoy a ""musical challenge"" your rewards will be great.

The entire cast and production crew are to be commended for thier efforts, and eventual results. Congratulations to all.... a WEll Done.

1635324,2,B00005NKVF,"Let me start off with saying I ADORE Jekyll and Hyde beyond belief. It still continues to hold a tight fist on my heart and I can't think of many more that surpass it.
  However, those were my thoughts on the original broadway cast...

  This movie, starring David Hasselhoff and Coline Sexten, was simply dreadful when it came to the leads. the actors who played Utterson, Mr Carew, and Spider, as I believe he was called, were simply wonderful at their parts, however Hasselhoff and his leading ladies left a great deal to be desired.
  First of all, Hasselhoff can not play an evil character. To say the least, I thought his interpritation of Jekyll was decent enough, but I swear I cringed at every transformation. Yes, the dynamic duo of Jekyll and Hyde is not an easy part to carry but Hasselhoff managed to destroy it with every fiber of his being.
  The actress who played Lucy was better than her romantic interests of both Jekyll and Hyde, however, it sounded more like she was used to pop singing, which is good, except when she tried to hit that high ""F"" in ""In his Eyes"". I am taking vocal lessons and working on that duet with a friend, and even though I complain about butchering that note myself, I still sound better than she did.
  The actress (who's name I can't recal) who played Emma, was better than the aformentioned leads, however, her acting was stiff and her portrayal of the character was somewhat different than what I expected after hearing Christiane Noll.
  As for the songs, well let me put it this way. I was grossly disappointed. Many vocal lines were spoken instead of sung and tempos got wildly out of hand. As I mentioned, Hasselhoff's Jekyll was passable, yet songs like ""Transformation"" and ""Alive!"" Were simply, in plain terms, HORRIBLE! The man cannot act, period.
  ""In His Eyes"" which has always held a special place in my heart was better though, as I mentioned, Lucy's ""F"" needed to sound less like a shreik.
  ""dangerous Game"" was absolutely terrible!!! ALl Jekyll did was grab Lucy from behind and his singing was attrocious. The actors in the back looked as though they were doing something very questionable and unneeded.
  The quartet was surprisingly very good. I was very pleased with the actor for utterson, and Facade was good as well.
  However, The ""Confrontation"", the very crowning glory of the final act was BUTCHERED and then fed to the dogs. I'm sorry, but Hasselhoff failed miserably, no question. THe least he could have done was moved off that back wall. He spent the entire song in one place, jerking from one side to the other. As one reviewer also stated, I was VERY embaressed for him.
  So, do I recommend this movie or not.. Quite frankly, if you're coming to this for the first time. Put the DVD down and get the original cast recording. Once you've drunk in the awesomeness of what a good musical this truly is, then watch it and see what you think. Deffinitely NOT a good first experience.",1143676800,7,2962,4.621414913957935
1635325,2,B00005NKVF,"Let me preface this by admitting that I have a strong dislike of David Hasselhoff so I find it impossible to write a review without some bias.  Forgive me.

I love Jekyll and Hyde.  I have seen it on stage numerous times, and I listen to the soundtrack frequently (original Broadway cast).  Stevenson's story is brilliant and timeless.  The story as a musical works well and is clever.  This version, however, does not work.

Let me start with the star, David Hasselhoff.  Vocally, he can handle the part.  He is not a fabulous singer, but he sounds pretty good most of the time.  It is his acting that cannot handle the part.  He is rather stiff most of the time then tries to emote by pounding his chest or raising his arms in the air which of course just looks apish.  The supposed climatic song, ""This is the Moment"" is very anticlimatic in this production.  Hasselhoff seems to be concentrating on just singing the words.  He does do surprising well with ""Confrontation"" which I imagine is a difficult song to perform as he transforms back and forth between two characters.

Hasselhoff is not the only less-than-stellar performer.  None of the lead parts are played by anyone of great talent.

I was disappointed in this production.  Jekyll & Hyde is a great musical when performed by a great cast.  Unfortunately no greatness was present in this production.",1134432000,6,1363,4.6991525423728815
1635326,3,B00005NKVF,"Jekyll & Hyde the Musical opened on Broadway in 1997 and then in 2000 before it left the theatre, the show was recorded with a current cast which included Baywatch's David Hasselhoff, Coleen Saxton and Andrea Rivette as Jekyll/Hyde, Lucy and Emma respectively.

As for me, I like the music and the plot of Jekyll & Hyde very much especially the big songs like ""This Is the Moment"" and ""Someone Like You"". I saw the show when it was touring in Chattanooga, Tennessee in 2000 and bought the cast recording and still can't put it down until today.

I bought this DVD with the hope of revisiting the musical that I enjoyed. The production was fine. It was a bit different in the tour but I still enjoy it. What bothers me are the actors! David Hasselhoff to begin with, he's really bad. The songs sung by Jekyll/Hyde require great actor-singer to perform them, not just any actor who can sing. Hassellhoff couldn't match with previous actors like Anthony Warlow, Robert Evan or Bob Cuccioli at all. He seems to be off-beat most of the time. His facial expression is horrible. He ruined ""Lost in the Darkness"" and ""This Is the Moment"" and other songs as well. Still, I would have to say that he did quite well in ""Confrontation"". He certainly surpasses my expectation in that one.

For the ladies, I would always adore Linda Eder and Christiane Noll. Though Coleen Saxton and Andrea Rivette can't live up to those performance but I think their performances are still enjoyable especially their duet in ""In His Eyes"". I watch that scene so many times I lost count. Their solos in songs like ""Once Upon a Dream"" and ""Someone Like You/A New Life"" are quite good.

The ensemble are kinda weird. I don't like the blocking for ""Facade"" and ""Murder,Murder"". It's different from what I saw before and what's with the umbrella? I also dislike the guys who play Utterson, Stride and Sir Carew.

Overall, if you are new to Jekyll & Hyde, I suggest you stick to the cast recording first. There are many versions available: The 1990 concept version with Colm Wilkinson and Linda Eder, The 1995 Complete Recording with Anthony Warlow, and The 1997 Original Broadway Cast with Bob Cuccioli. To me, the OBC is the best in terms of overall listening but Anthony Warlow is the best Jekyll/Hyde.

If you are familiar with Jekyll & Hyde and want to have the stage version of the show then buy it but be prepared with the standards of the actors. They're not as good as the OBC at all.",1129680000,14,2459,4.577272727272727

1635328,2,B00005NKVF,"Ok, I have 2 words for you....DAVID HASSELHOFF. Of course when viewing this DVD, I desperately wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt. I realized that Hasselhoff had the build and ""look"" of a Jekyll/Hyde...but, could he sing it? I was only familiar with his cheesy uplifting ballads that had been so popular in countries overseas....and that is exactly what I got from viewing this production.

Hasselhoff was in NO WAY capable of handling this role. There were times on this DVD where his voice seemed strained, and he wandered the stage as if he was completely overcome by nervousness...it was just dreadful. It was like watching a video of a trainreck. I also noticed that he floated in and out of a british accent which was just embarrassing and his ""transformation"" scene was nothing more than pulling his hair in and out of his face. HORRIBLE.

I must give Kudos to the other performers beside Hasselhoff, who were the ""REAL DEALS""...it's a shame that they had to be in a production headed up by someone who had absolutely NO CLUE what he was doing.

What kind of a world do we live in where the only way they will tape a broadway show is if a washed up tv star is at the helm of it?? The only thing different from Hasselhoffs performance in this compared to his performance on his ""HIT TV SHOW"" was a pair of red swim shorts....",1123459200,5,1340,4.483606557377049
1635329,4,B00005NKVF,"Jekyll and Hyde, is one of those musicals that can either be good or terrible.  David Hasselholf finally gets a chance at his dream to be a lead on broadway, overall he did a decent job, but the wrong musical for him.

Jekyll and Hyde is my all time favorite show, but I admit it can be bad if performed terribly.  But I would have to say that this show did pretty good, but it wasn't a broadway production to me, just because of hasselholf.

Hasselholf portrays a good Jekyll, (even though I am more impressed with Athony Warlow's ""This is the Moment"" then hasselholfs) But when Hasselholf becomes Hyde...... thats where it falls apart, his Hyde is exactly the same as Jekyll except his hair is down ( cuccioli's Hyde is very impressive)

Sexton's does a very good job as Lucy, her voice is very clean and fresh to the stage, I was impressed watching her perform ""Someone Like You"", but I still have to give the best portrayel to Linda (cmon we all know its true)

The talent was good for the show, But what I was most impressed with was the set.  They did a very good job on the special affects just like they had on Broadway with cuccioli.  I loved it when Jekyll set fire to his lab.

so overall if you've never seen the show before and your interested its worth seeing, but if you are educated in the show then you can deal without it.",1116201600,2,1340,4.285714285714286
1635330,3,B00005NKVF,"I must confess to being a Jekyll & Hyde fan, sort of. It is a show that I think has a lot of potential, but it is potential that has never been fully realized. It has the distinct feel of an unfinished product, even though it's been around for a decade or so and was conceived over two decades ago. The show has changed quite a bit over time -- the original concept recording was extremely pop-sounding. The complete work recording was the closest to what the show should have been -- exploring more of what Jekyll's experiment was actually doing to him and why he kept on doing it -- but the pacing wasn't good. The broadway incarnation did away with a lot of the more intellectual aspects of the show and made the show more of a campy horror show by overexaggerating the differences between Jekyll and Hyde, but it had much better pacing.

Hyde, I believe, needs to be an almost sympathetic character for the show to be really effective. For example, when he is killing the members of the hospital's board of governors, we all know what he is doing is wrong, but we can understand why he is doing it. To that end, I think the broadway show's version of Dangerous Game as almost a rape scene destroys this and just makes him an overdone villain, not because the rape is an inconceivable act but because he started out causing physical damage to Lucy. I think it weakens the story to try to put Hyde's evil forth as simply causing random physical violence for no apparent reason.

So, that said, this DVD captures the broadway incarnation. I will say that I have more respect for David Hasselhoff for having taken on this role. He has some genuinely good moments (The Way Back). Unfortunately, he has a number of really bad acting moments and times when he is just not with the music (Alive, Dangerous Game, Confrontation) that greatly diminish the overall quality here. One thing I will say in Hasselhoff's favor is that he is WAY, WAY, WAY better than Sebastian Bach in the role (I had the misfortune of seeing the show live with Bach in it), but unfortunately this is really just an indication of how bad Bach was rather than an indication of how good Hasselhoff was.

The rest of the cast is pretty good, although none of them really shines. I didn't like George Merritt especially much on the DVD, but I had the opportunity to see him live in the same role and thought he was very good.

Overall, this one is hard to recommend unless you are definitely a fan of the musical, and even then it may be hard to get past some of this one's weak points. For some reason, even though this is a broadway production, it feels like it was filmed at a high school. Perhaps that has something to do with the film style, and a little to do with the replacement of the more risque Bring on the Men with the relatively tame and extremely cheesy Good and Evil.",1113696000,3,2849,4.4106463878327
1635331,2,B00005NKVF,"I was very surprised to see that so many people enjoyed this version of Jekyll & Hyde, though I might ask why.  David Hasselhoff is understandable (who gives this guy the idea that he can sing?) but the rest of this cast wasn't much better.  Coleen Sexton's voice is extremely whiney and at times she looks like she's struggling to hit the high notes.  Linda Eder did a much better job than she did and the role of Lucy is an alto role, not a soprano role.  Andrea Rivette, I also didn't like much, she sounded like she was singing through her nose and her wig is just awful.  Is Emma Always doomed to have terrible hair? On the plus side, she's better than Sexton.  The rest of the cast isn't that great except for George Merritt and Barrie Ingham, they were just outstanding.

1635333,4,B00005NKVF,"I'm a huge musical fan and I must say that Jekyll and Hyde is absolutely one of my favorite shows.

Before seeing Mr. Hasselhoff's version of the film I had seen Sebastian Bach live in the role of Jekyll and had also listened to Robert Cuccioli (my personal favorite) in the soundtrack extensively, and I have to say that of the three most famous men to play the role, Hasselhoff is not exactly my favorite.

He simply does not do as well as the leading man of a Broadway show should. His vocals are mediocre at best, and pale in comparison to Bach and Cuccioli.

His performance, however, is not to say by any means that this show or this film in specific is bad. It is not. The score is absolutely golden, and George Merrit (Utterson) and Coleen Sexton (Lucy) are superb. This show is truly awesome, but it is simply not the best example of the show I can name--it is just the only one on DVD.",1103414400,,895,4.284023668639053
1635334,3,B00005NKVF,"A beautiful show, vocally enthralling with such captivating characters... so why ruin it by casting David Hasselhoff? You can argue that everything about this musical is so well done, and I can agree to an extent but I am telling you not to buy this because Dave ruins the whole thing. David acts the show well enough but he can't sing a show that has been declared one of the most challanging. David does this thing when he sings the really strong parts of the show he tries a vibratto and it fails... miserablly. The show has so many good qualities, so if you know someone who has it borrow it, defineately not worth the money to buy. Something to say for the show, is that the women all rock. Lucy and Emma own their parts heart and soul! Choose with care.",1101427200,,759,4.352112676056338
1635335,3,B00005NKVF,"For a fair and balanced review, let's subtract out David Hasselhoff for the time being.  Don't worry, I'll get back to him.  The music is wonderful whether or not you know the show.  I would have liked close-captions for those unfamiliar with it, but I could see how that would become difficult with the choral parts.  The cast was amazing.  From the principles to the chorus, every person knew their part and their place.  The music flows one piece into the next, although the ladies' songs can be a bit long-winded.  The story puts a wonderful twist on the traditional Jekyll and Hyde.  You can honestly feel for Henry and his obsession to eradicate madness.  The set was minimalistic but completely versatile and compelling.  The blood-red floor with the black-frame buildings complemented the show rather than detracting from it like a grand set would have done.  The pieces moved flawlessly on tracks in the floor so you were never disturbed by stagehands.  And the changing camera angles actually helped rather than hindered your watching enjoyment.  All around, I enjoyed it.

Now let's put David back into the equation.  For a man best known for talking to a car and bimbos on the beach, he did an admirable job.  No, he isn't the best singer in the world.  His vibrato is variable depending on his emotional intent, his tone is decent although sometimes he breaks off his air pressure, but he can certainly hold his own.  And honestly, I've seen lesser singers in better roles.  His acting can be over the top, but this might have been because the cameras were rolling that night.  I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt because of his incredible portrayal of Edward Hyde.  While he might be a bit grandiose as Henry Jekyll, he was perfectly cast as Hyde.  Watching his body movements and those menacing, psychotic eyes gave me the creeps.  He certainly had the passion and heart for this role, even if he was a bit of a ham.  And with such a wonderful role where you're on stage almost every moment, who could blame him for hamming it up?

If David's singing and acting had been a bit better, and he had actually tried to use an English accent when everyone else was, I would have given it four stars.",1100822400,3,2221,4.618925831202046
1635336,1,B00005NKVF,"I agree with Michael P. Nolan comments but the music.
I think the music score is great. The production sucks. David H should stay with cars and the beaches. He destroyed the songs. People, who gave 5 stars probably did not see the original cast on Broadway or didn't hear the CD. I saw 15 minutes on HBO and switched to Disney channel. I would not even spend $3 to rent it.",1098403200,4,373,4.194444444444445
1635337,4,B00005NKVF,"Despite that the musical itself is not perfect and that this cast most definitely is flawed, I find the video to be extremely entertaining. I've watched it dozens of times. As someone else mentioned, if you're an acting student, you could watch David Hasselhoff for what NOT to do as an actor. In fact, most of his performance in the first act is laughable and his singing is not very strong. But as the show goes on, he does get better. For the most part, he has a lot of bad acting moments and a lot of mediocre singing moments, but in the brief moments when he's good, he's really good and you find yourself impressed, but then the moment is gone and he's back to his overdone soap star routine again.

  Coleen Sexton as Lucy has a bit of a whiny singing voice on the big songs but her portrayal of the character is very likeable. Andrea R. as Emma is great. Her singing is beautiful and acting is fine.

 Overall this is definitely not the dream cast I would have used to make this video, but it is still entertaining despite all its flaws and if you like the musical, you should have it in your collection-even if you just watch it to laugh at it.",1096588800,2,1153,4.270642201834862

1635340,3,B00005NKVF,"There are MANY things I could say about this production.  Many of them are very negative, namely the less-than-decent (to be polite) singing of ""pop sensation"" David Hasselhoff.  I must admit, he certainly HAS come a long way from ""Baywatch"", but I would definitely not go so far to say that musical theater is his forte.  The show is not one of my favorites, but most of the cast is fairly strong, namely George Merritt, who spent a number of years with the Metropolitan Opera.  All of the music is well-written; there are just far too many repetitive ballads (lovely music, just slighty ""draggy"" -- 3 key changes per song, minimum haha).  The show has grown on me since I bought this video, but it is still painful to watch Hasselhoff butcher ""This Is the Moment"".  His performance as Hyde is definitely stronger than that of Jekyll (which is very forced, even cheesy), and the show gets better as it goes on, however, I doubt it will ever be a ""classic"".  It's a shame Anthony Warlow couldn't have been part of this cast.  If you're already a fan of the show, or have no background in singing or theater, I'd recommend this product (As Hasselhoff's performance is unlikely to mar the opinion of a true""Jeckie"" or an untrained ear).",1088640000,3,1234,4.602739726027397

I admit that I had never before heard him sing but really, he does have a very strong voice and did a wonderful job as the leading man playing a dual personality.  You get the REAL feeling that he truly is two people!
The rest of the cast are outstanding.  Coleen Sexton (Lucy Harris) and Andrea Rivette (Emma Carew) had amazing voices and complimented each other very well during duets.  George Merritt (John Utterson) was perfect in his role as attorney and friend.  I was extremely pleased with his performance and the narration as well as the narration provided by Barrie Ingam (Sir Carew).
The musical score was outstanding, the vocals were amazing, and the acting will keep you on the edge of your seat.  Emotions definitely go from one extreme to another going through sheer romance, extreme animalistic lust, simple friendship, and forever unconditional love.
This one is a keeper.  It is definitely a work of art for your collection.  I have purchased two copies, one for my own collection and one for my mother - who also is a theater buff but, like myself, is not able to attend the theater itself anymore.
As David proclaims during his speech, he has most certainly ""come a long way from the beach and the talking car"".  It was his moment to shine and shine he did.  I only hope he will continue on his theatrical quest.",1088553600,2,1547,4.572463768115942

I had heard he did well as a singer in Europe.  I could not believe how fantastic he was in this musical.  His voice is awesome.  I have not seen a part played so well since Michael Crawford in ""Phantom of the Opera"".  This particular character definitely had to be a strong person with a strong voice - let me tell you Michael Hasselhoff does the job!  I was so impressed I got on Amazon today just to buy it.  I have to see it again!  You will not be disappointed.",1087862400,,638,4.155737704918033
1635343,3,B00005NKVF,"This is a decent production that's brought down by a mediocre leading man. I give David Hasselhoff full credit for even trying to fill the shoes of Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde, and attempting to break away from his less than impressive background. However, his acting is often too forced, and his singing is very horizontal and strained. During his ""transformation"" from Jekyll to Hyde, one finds themselves trying to hold their laughter at bay, rather than their fears. While you can tell that he is putting his best foot forward, you wonder how his fellow actors could've kept going with the show while he was rollicking in some sort of dinner theatre fairy land. He slaughters (with the best of intentions) ""Lost in the Darkness,"" ""This is the Moment,"" and ""Confrontation."" However, what this show lacks in its protagonist, it more than makes up for in its supporting cast.
Coleen Sexton is a pleasure as the ill-fated Lucy. Her acting is decent, and her voice has a light, lyric quality that Linda Eder's does not. It makes Lucy seem more like an innocent victim of circumstance than a desperate lady of the evening. At times, her vocalization is a little tight, but both ""Someone Like You"" and ""A New Life"" are beautiful.
Andrea Rivette is the standout member of the cast, and it's a shame that her bright, sincere soprano and warm, spot-on acting in the role of Emma Carew are overshadowed by Sexton. She has a presence that makes her scenes shine, and, in truth, Emma has some of the more original and better-crafted pieces in the show. ""Once Upon a Dream"" is lovely.
George Merrit as John Utterson, Barry Ingham as Sir Danvers, and Corinne Melanon as Lady Beaconsfield and Guinevere round out an excellent supporting cast. Their performances coupled with those of the leading ladies only solidify Hasselhoff's position as an undertrained fish in a gigantic pond.
Wildhorn's score can be a tad bit poppy, and if you don't understand the message that every person has good and evil residing in them by the end of the show, you should be shot. But, Hasselhoff and a few minor musical flubs aside, this is good for a few hours entertainment. My advice would be to rent it or catch it on HBO Signature.",1087776000,5,2199,4.699481865284974
1635344,1,B00005NKVF,"""Jekyll and Hyde"", aside from ""Phantom"" and ""Les Miz"", is my favorite musical. Frank Wildhorn writes a compelling score that perfectly matches the tone. Leslie Bricusse's lyrics may drop at some points, but they're doubtlessly good. However, they definitely should have filmed the flawless original cast headed by Robert Cuccioli, Linda Eder, and Christiane Noll. The cast in this DVD is a total nightmare.
David Hasselhoff doesn't seem to understand his role at all. He's not bad, he's abysmal. He cannot sing at all and totally ruins every song. His Dr. Jekyll is so underplayed, you would wonder if he's even thinking about what he's saying. He also underestimates Mr. Hyde, and it's hilarious trying to watch be terryfing.
I was never a big fan of Linda Eder, but Colleen Sexton is even worse. It's true I think her voice suits the Lucy part, but it seems that all she cares about is notes. She doesn't even think about the words she is saying. A perfect example is ""Good and Evil"", she sings it so casually, you'd think she was asleep. It's truly sad that she can be worse than Linda Eder.
Andrea Rivette has the most anoying voice in the whole world. Her super-nasal tones can't even compare with Christiane Noll's crystal-clear voice.
The ensemble is also horrible. They just don't have ""it"". They have no intensity at all and the movement in ""Facade"" is laughable.
On a more positive note, the visual aspects of this DVD are stunning. The sets, lighting, costumes, and makeup are all done expertly.
This cast became the closing cast for a reason. If this is the only version of ""Jekyll and Hyde"" you've heard, by all means get the Original Broadway Cast Recording. If you are familiar with the show, don't waste your money on this, because a high school could do better than this",1087603200,5,1787,4.730769230769231

It became my favorite musical, more so than Phantom, Les Miz, Aida, Rent, you get the idea.  There's just something about it.  I'll tell you what it is: the story, the music, the talent, the emotion, the music, the music, the music, and....the music.  I love the music!! And much more so when the actors can sing it! And sing it well!  And the cast for this DVD did, for the most part.
I was afraid to watch this DVD, because I knew I had to compare it to the original Broadway cast recording, and the performance I saw, but I was pleasantly surprised.  David Hasselhoff is pretty good, but I would have been more excited to see Sebastian Bach.  He's cuter.
I was VERY impressed by Andrea and how she flawlessly played and sang Emma.  She has a great voice too.  At first I was kinda annoyed with Coleen's singing voice - sooo much higher and different than Linda Eder's (who is truly talented, and whose voice is gorgeous), but when she began hitting the hard notes and showing her skill, I warmed up to her.  Her acting was good too.
This is a great musical, so obviously I'd like anything to do with it.  And having the musical on hand to watch whenever I want, with a perfect view, is hard to resist.

I mean, WHY David Hasselhoff? All that kept coming into my mind was ""Baywatch, Knightrider, Baywatch..."" I mean, Why not Robert Cuccioli, or, better yet, Anthony Warlow? However my opinion changed greatly when I watched this DVD.
  Yes, it's true that Hasselhoff can't sing as good as some of the other people who have played the role on stage, but one must remember that this was his first musical. I mean, come on and give him some credit! What really catches your attention is not his singing or his magnificent acting, but his enthusiasm. Watching it, you can really tell that he is having a rollicking good time up there. However, this sometimes leads to overacting. I DO think that he makes a better Hyde than Jekyll, because as Hyde, he makes a masterful use of body language to suggest the character's evil. And he wasn't even wearing make-up! The ensemble was excellent, and Coleen Sexton made an excellent Lucy. Her sweet, sentimental portrayal is a refreshing change to Linda Eder's more bitter and dreamy one. (Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Linda Eder, I just liked having another person in the role.) Other remarkable co-stars included George Merrit as John Utterson (a very intense actor), Barrie Ingham as Sir Danvers Carew, and Andrea Rivette as Emma Carew (I LOVE her voice!).
  The special effects were excellent too, some of the best I've seen in a musical, (really remarkable is when Hyde kills the hypocritical Bishop of Basingstoke and sets his body on fire). The atmosphere and sets were magnifecent, and the scene changes seamless. The DVD includes a theatrical trailer, a ""Show Prelude with David Hasselhoff"", Scene Selection, and Cast Bios. It's shown in good 'ol widescreen, and has Dolby digital 5.1 and 2.0 soundtracks. All in all, well worth the money. I will indeed watch this over again many times.",1078531200,,2053,4.790960451977401

This production is incredibly disappointing when compared to some of the original productions, which had much better/stronger cast members.  I understand this might have been a dream for Hasselhoff, but it was a bit of a nightmare for fans of this musical.
Perhaps if you've never seen this musical at all, you might be able to able to appreciate this version on some level, but for fans of J&H overall, I think you will be equally disappointed with this version as I was.",1077494400,,772,4.553956834532374

Well, let me tell you, I still haven't raised my score to anything above 1 star.
First, those who only saw the Broadway version in NY, you haven't seen the show as it was originally staged (a much better, fuller version).
The last time I saw Jekyll & Hyde on stage (the 7th time) was in San Diego (Balboa Park's Starlight Theatre).  It was a full version of the show (which included performed songs from both the double CD set and some changes made in the Broadway cast CD).  In other words the show was extended to include everything.
Why they originally cut Bring on the Men for Good and Evil and cut I Need to Know from the Broadway version is beyond me.
I do like the additions of Lost In the Darkness and Letting Go - good touches - too bad they weren't performed better.
I just remembered something (petty?) that was overlooked in this DVD version.  In the touring versions, Henry Jekyll drinks the potion.  In this DVD version he injects it into his arm.  Now if it was injected, why would he say that it was ""Warm in the Gullet"".  (Gullet:  The tube by which food and drink are carried from the pharynx to the stomach; the esophagus) LOL.
Sounds nitpicky but after seing the show on stage 7 times, I notice stuff like that.
A response to another review - yes, David Hasselhof, I'm sure, did his best and looks at his performance in J&H as a huge highlight in his career.  Fine, but he could have taken on a show that would have given him less critical review and worked up to this performance.  It's not one you just throw youself into because you wanted to do it.  Did he audition???  Although, I did hear a rumor that he financed all or some of this production - so we do have to thank him for the only visual performance of the show we can watch at home.  (I keep my hand on the mute or ff button for the parts I can't dare to watch or listen to).
To end, just watch the show and enjoy what you can of it.  There are some parts that are OK to sit through.  Better yet, buy and listen to the two CD set of Jekyll & Hyde - you'll be pleased.

Clearly, David put both his heart and soul into this performance. I was moved both emotionally and spritually by his performance and appreciate most of all that he didn't let the so-called professional critics hold him back from taking on this immense task. Thankfully, he did take it on, and did a most admirable job of it. Having seen him in many other venues, I believe he has pulled off the performance of a lifetime for himself. What a shame that some people expect too much from an actor; And double shame to those that criticise Mr. hasselhoff as being inadequate on the stage, and that he also lacks voice capability; Quite the contrary. This production need not be in the top eschelon of Broadway shows to be both entertaining, moving, and wonderful to watch.

1635351,3,B00005NKVF,"Unfortunately, this show as well as many others chose to film with its closing cast.  Keep in mind that shows uusally close for a reason: casts tend to get worse and worse as a show progresses through its run.
This show had a lot of potential it's original cast (starring Robert Cucciolli and Linda Eder) was absolutely fantastic and really brought Frank Wildhorn's excellent score to life.  Although the plot takes many liberties from those described by Robert Louis Stevenson in his classic short story ""The Strange Case of Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,"" the key elements are still there and in a way improve on the original version.
David Hasselhoff sings like a goat with an overly intense rapid vibratto and his female co-stars outshine him easily.  Coleen Sexton and Andrea Rivette are very well cast and have nice voices but still cannot live up to the original cast.
To be completely honest, I did not even see the oringal cast on stage, I am judging this primarily by clips I have seen of them and the original cast album.
I disagree with people who say Wildhorn wrote a weak score, I believe that the music was very well written and there are plenty of ""Jeckies"" who constantly hum the tunes.  I do, however, see many similarities in the score to Wildhorn's short-lived musical ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"" songs sound similar and there are similar vamps playing in the background of each song.  However, Wildhorn, for the first time, incorporated several musical motifs that are effective for the first few times you hear them but, to some, are overused.  But the orchestration is excellent and the direction is very effective.  Thus, don't blame Wildhorn.
But, let's not only blame the leads, the ensemble was rarely together, it sounded either poorly rehearsed or just poor casting because it seems like the chorus cannot follow the orchestra or follow eachother.
I gave this DVD three stars because the show had potential that was demolished by its casting.  Maybe in a few years it will be revived with better direction and better casting, then it will be time to replace this DVD with something more appealing.
My advice is this:  If you're a fan of the music, feel free to buy this DVD to get an idea of the show and how it looked.
If you really want to appreciate the show however, buy the original cast or even the concept recording to really get an idea of the show before you touch this DVD.",1070150400,7,2405,4.680094786729858
1635352,4,B00005NKVF,"To start off, I must confess that I am a huge fan of Jekyll & Hyde...I would consider it my second favorite musical (after Les Miserables, and who could honestly beat that?). So when I saw that there was a version on VHS, I was thrilled! However, perhaps I have been spoiled with the greats from the original cast, such as the exquisite Robert Cuccioli and heart-wrenching Linda Eder. I felt that Hasselhoff began on a low note (his ""Lost in the Darkness"" was horrible), and he didn't get much better throughout...but I didn't think he was excruciatingly painful. Nor did I feel that he completely ruined the performance. There were some numbers that were beautifully done. ""Facade"" remains one of my favorite numbers, with a solid chorus to pull it off. ""His Work and Nothing More"" was fantastic! Andrea Rivette as Emma stood out through the entire show...her portrayal of Emma Carew (who is always overshadowed by Lucy) was so honest and chilling at points. Her version of ""Once Upon a Dream"" was so simplistically beautiful that I couldn't help crying. She lent a distinct personality to a character that often is discredited. At least she was given the very last lines of the show....
In addition, I felt that John Utterson (unfortunately I do not recall the name of the actor) had an amazing voice. His voice added a depth and richness generally lacking (as a whole) throughout the rest of the show. It was a breath of fresh air in some scenes.
Coleen Sexton, as the tragically impoverished Lucy, adds a depth to her role that I loved. While her singing occasionally felt pushed, her acting was especially lovely. I found myself on the verge of tears after ""A New Life,"" in which I finally was able to sympathize with her...
As a whole, I think this recording was a good one, and I would certainly prefer it over nothing. I think we must all look past Hasselhoff and give credit where it is deserved.",1068249600,5,1905,4.6390532544378695

1635355,5,B00005NKVF,Hasselhoff is great in this play if you get rid of the thought of him running along the beach in Baywatch. This is how I came to loving this play; I was flipping through the channels on TV. Nothing good was on and I had noticed that a play called Jekyll and Hyde:The Musical had been running for days. So I decided to watch it. I atomatically fell in love with it. I didn't even know who David Hasselhoff was! I had never heard of him before. When I saw this play I thought he was outstanding. Today I have seen Knight Rider and a couple of episodes of Baywatch. Hasselhoff does have a nack for choosing cheezy role but this was not one of them. If you clear all past shows/movies with David in them and think of him as a brand new actor on TV he is wonderful. I love all the songs. They have brought them to a faster tempo than the OBC CD. I love that! Jekyll and Hyde:The Musical is magnificent!!!! Anyone who loves the music and production will love this DVD! Read my other review in the VHS.,1061337600,3,995,4.134020618556701

The anthem ""This is the Moment"" sung by Hasselhoff could have been done performed better on his account. All in all I adored Hasselhoff in this piece. He expresses his feelings into this play. Coleen Sexton 'Lucy' is adorable in her role. Her voice is wonderful. The cast was put together nicely. I love the Broadway Preformance!",1058572800,,501,4.5777777777777775
1635358,1,B00005NKVF,"I love this musical.  For seven months I did nothing but eat sleep and drink this musical.  I performed in the role as Sir Archibald Proops on stage.  This is quite possibly my favorite musical of all time.  However, that nearly changed when, at the cast party, someone popped in the DVD.  David Hasselhoff was horrendous as the title character...  Really watching this movie and watching his reactions were heartbreaking.  For instance, ""Dangerous Game"" is traditionally a lust song, but more of a longing lust, not a ""oh, I want to rape you"" kind of lust.  Hasselhoff turned it into rape.  It was cold, unemotional, unfeeling.  The Transformation scene was rediculous as well.  When the drugs finally start to kick in with a vengance, he spasmodically dances around the stage, only to finish it with a Baywatch-esque swim across the glossy floors...  I did buy it, though.  It wasn't for me to sit there and watch and enjoy it as a musical.  Oh, no.  In my video library, it is kept under ""Comedy"".",1057017600,2,1000,4.699421965317919
1635359,5,B00005NKVF,"I have never seen Jekyll&Hyde live on Broadway, so this DVD is probably the closest I'll ever get to seeing it live. And this is why it nearly drives me insane every time I think of why on earth the producers chose Hasselhoff to portray a broadway role that requires such a range of vocal talent. However since it seems the general consensus of the reviewers that Hasselhoff has no business in musicals, I will concentrate on all the wonderful aspects of this DVD that prevail over his pitiable performance and why I gave it a perfect rating.
First of all, Coleen Sexton is reason enough to buy this DVD! From her first song ""No One Knows Who I Am"" (well the abridged version) to her tear-jerking ""A New Life"" she portrays well the subtle complexities of Lucy. I think she is just as good as Linda Eder, although I have never seen her perform so I can't say I prefer one over the other as Lucy - both women are incredible. The rest of the cast is breath-taking. It truly amazes me every time I watch how they execute such pulsating performances like ""Murder, murder"". Every cast member sings with all that they've got, and it truly does make a difference. Maybe the more important thing is that they don't OVER do it, which was one of Hasselhoff's many problems. Sometimes the subtlies of a simple gesture or even a look given to another cast member make group songs like ""Facade"" especially real. It also prevents the musical from looking fake and corny (again Hasselhoff's problem), because all things considered this is a pretty serious musical - we don't need people acting ridiculous to mess up the atmosphere. Again, amazing that this acheived even sparingly considering Hasselhoff is the main character...
Overall, this is an excellent DVD and Jekyll&Hyde remains among my favorite musicals. I'm not sure how words can ever describe the power and beauty I find in Jekyll&Hyde, but my advice to you is try to listen to all versions of it. And as for Hasselhoff in this DVD, as much as I condemned him, he's not half-bad when playing the evil Edward Hyde. Just mute the TV whenever Hasselhoff has a solo and you'll be fine.",1051056000,2,2128,4.602631578947369

I never ""loved"" this musical, but this DVD has made me seriously re-consider. I am used to Nose Bleed seats, this was a nice change and actually made me see things I could not in the theatre. Although David H. is just ""OK"", the leading ladies completely carry the entire show. If you want to see a great musical with a dark twist, watch this DVD.

I have read the book over and over again.  My sister bought me this video as a present because she knew how much I enjoyed JEKYLL AND HYDE, but by the time it was over, we were both dumbfounded.
David Hasselhoff is simply not big enough for the part.  Jekyll and Hyde are supposed to be two entirely different personalities with different voices, faces, and statures.  Hasselhoff does not distinguish the two characters, which degrades the entire point of the story.  Maybe it would have helped if he had read the book before the performance.  In the transformation scenes, he appears to be doing acrobatics rather than convulsions.
Many of the singers do not have the vocal capacity for the parts that they played.  Two characters lived up to their parts - Utterson and the red-bearded man in the chorus.  The historical discrepancies in costume and hair are abominable.
I highly recommend that you experience this play because it is a work of art and masterfully displays the musical genius of Frank Wildhorn and Leslie Bricusse, but find another way because this performance is a vast disappointment.",1046044800,3,1261,4.8279069767441865

1635364,2,B00005NKVF,"I agree that David H. was probably one of the reasons for the musicals sudden removal from the Bway scene.  I originally saw J&H with the original cast in 1998 and I can only imagine what Rob Cuccioli must be thinking after seeing this.  From the first song the lack of stage presence and genuine acting is visible probably enhanced by the intimate nature the camera can provided.  David H. was clearly not cut out for this role and was not prepared enough.  Luckily he had a strong cast to back him up, the role of Lucy while not living up to Linda Eder was performed superbly.  David H. however does redeem himself within the second act a little after much warming up, some of his singing improved as well as the acting.  He is a much better Hyde than Jekyll.  During the ""confrontation"" he made up a little for the transformation which brought me very close to changing the channel.  It is apparent what a man with money and an agent can get.  Let's hope he doesn't decide he wants to be in Rent....Not a bad deal, i wanna be in a musical....Ok here you go...o you cant sing...well you have money so i guess we have no choice.

1635365,4,B00005NKVF,"Alright...I wasn't planning on reviewing this DVD, but I feel that I need to clear up a few points that I have seen in other reviews and, in my humble and almost entirely uneducated opinion, feel are wrong.
a) David Hasselhoff has no vibrato--The man has SO much vibratto, it should be outlawed. He uses it to make up for the lack of power in his voice.
b) ...No, I never saw Linda Eder as Lucy, but the songs WERE WRITTEN FOR HER!! Of COURSE she's going to sing them well!!! Not to knock Linda Eder or anything...she is a magnificent singer, and I've heard she's a wonderful actress, but don't compare apples to oranges. Ms. Sexton and Ms. Rivette have beautiful voices, and they are both WONDERFUL actresses.
c) David Hasselhoff's ""Confrontation"" was particularly stunning- Look, I'm not saying it was bad...There's NO WAY I would be able to do a song like that (For those of you who don't know, the lead actor sings as both Jekyll and Hyde in the same song). But Mr. Hasselhoff's rendition was not the best. Anyone who has heard Anthony Warlow would swear that two men were singing, or that it was spliced, because he NEVER breathes. Mr. Hasselhoff breathes quite often.
Alright...there's my refutations. Now for my personal opinions. This show was definately carried by the cast, but Mr. Hasselhoff DOES NOT RUIN THE SHOW!!! He seems more comfortable (and is pretty good) as Hyde, because he tends to overact Jekyll. His singing is good...it's just weak. He doesn't have a Broadway voice. But I do commend him for following his dream.
Mr. Hasselhoff, I think, gets an unfair rap. The first time you hear the DVD, it is a bit shocking, especially if you're used to hearing stronger voices in the role. But after you get used to it, the viewing experience is perfectly enjoyable.
SO...here's my advice: If you like the musical, or THINK you will like the musical, buy it. Listen to it one time ALL THE WAY THROUGH...you can lower the volume on David Hasselhoff if you like, but listen to him. (The volume should DEFINATELY be up any time the leading ladies are singing, ugh...they might possibly be the best of all of the J&H casts) Once the shock wears off, the additional viewings will be highly enjoyable.",1044576000,3,2210,4.64030612244898
1635366,2,B00005NKVF,"Okay, so I admit I'd never heard of David Hasselhoff, but given the huge play he got (ie, name above the title), I knew he was supposed to be a big name, so I worried about how he would fair in a fairly vocally challenging role. I was right to have worried.
Whoever cast him should be forced to listen to him trying to sing ""This is the moment,"" which USED to be one of my favorite songs.
Oh, and the supporting cast is adequate if uninspired, the costuming is trite and boring, the camera work is tired, and I still like the original music better, you know, before they cut ""Bring on the men."" It might not have added anything to the story line, but it was a good song!

1635367,5,B00005NKVF,"Hasselhoff has always best been known for Baywatch and Knight Rider. Still, David had one dream and that was to be on broadway and have his name up in big lights, on opening night. Well, David certainly did disserve this role as Henry Jekyll and Edward Hyde. My favortie songs and why are listed below
1. What? Facade Why? Because the cast puts all there diafram and sing with all they got, they have what it takes and they sound just the way I expected them to sound , perfect!
2. What? Jekyll's Plea Why? Because as you can see the reactions and feelings David feels during this song you will love it.
3. What? Murder, Murder Why? Duh, suspense , suspsense and more suspense!
4. What? Dangerous Game Why? Because you can never ask Coleen and David to do better in there lusty performances , I love there voices.
5. What? Alive (Reprise) Why? David is perfect as Eddie as he sings and vicously stabs the Bishop to death with his cane.
6. What? Sympathy, Tenderness (Reprise) Why? Edward sings sofly as Lucy breathes her final breath, he always rock's at any song!
7. What? Confrontation Why? David did not loose his breath during this song at all, infact he didn't take one breath he kept going.
8. What? Good N' Evil Why? Lucy is beautiful , sexy and sweet as she tells Henry about Good And Evil.
I love this musical, when I am always feeling bad I can always play this movie and my frown soon turns into a grin sometimes into tears of sadness and joy. Why, joy? Because as I see the cast bow and walk off stage it just is upsetting that the fun is over and the music that was there has faded into the darkness. This movie is so beautifully adapted and so wonderfully casted, I would give this movie 2 thumbs up , and 8 fingers most defintely up! I have written another review for this read it!

1635368,5,B00005NKVF,"Andrea Rivette (Emma), Coleen Sexton (Lucy) make David Hasselhoff comfortable with protraying the good and evil Jekyll and Hyde. Resting with an injured arm I had come across this musical on one of my movie channels, I came into the second act, content on staying. Hasselhoff has come a long way from talking to K.I.T.T. on Knight Rider, Baywatch's Mitch. I am riveted on the performances of all the actors throughout the musical. The score will written eases into the characters, as Hasseloff in act two begins his terror with both sides. I never knew Hasselhoff had such a strong voice, whereas most actor/singers know they have a voice and can stumble upon the lyrics. Hasselhoff proves he can justly sing as Jekyll or Hyde, you can feel the terror crawl up your spine as you keep your eye glued to Hyde. Your heart sinks for Lucy and Emma for what Hyde has done. Carefully watch Hasselhoff's performance as the experiment begins, listen carefully to the lyrics, his expressions. Your eyes will move with every beat of your heart, you'll want to feel for Jekyll as he realizes who Hyde really is. Hasselhoff has found his calling, he does belong on stage, he belongs singing in more musicals.

1635369,4,B00005NKVF,"I had three recurring thoughts while watching ""Jekyll & Hyde: The Musical.""  First, I wished they would slow down the tempo a bit, or at least run an announcement that the production was being compressed for time.  I know the attention span of the modern audience grows less each year but the increased tempo bothered me on most of the songs and took away my enjoyment from my favorite piece in the show, the quartet ""Your Work--And Nothing More.""  Second, whatever his vocal limitations, I was impressed to see how David Hasselhoff affected the transformation back and forth between Jekyll and Hyde through body posture and the use of his flowing mane of curly hair (and without makeup).  Third, I was liked the singing voices of both good girl Andrea Rivette and bad girl Coleen Sexton, both in their duet ""In His Eyes"" and separately.  Agreed, Sexton is not Linda Eder, but then who is this side of Streisand? (Besides, how many singers have their husband writing songs for their voice in shows on Broadway?).
Of course, in my experience of musicals I have never actually seen a Broadway show on Broadway.  When your main diet of such things are touring companies or productions in L.A. or the Twin Cities you become accustomed to hearing voices other than the original (the exception would be seeing Michael Crawford perform ""Phantom of the Opera"" in L.A.).
As for Hasselhoff's performance of the show's anthem, ""This is the Moment,"" my complaint remains that the song simply does not fit the story (a truth proven every time someone uses it for their ice skating routine).  After all, nobody who sees this show is going to be unfamiliar with the story: we know what is going to happen when Dr. Jekyll takes his injection.  The result is that ""This is the Moment"" provides the worst sort of unintentional irony.  The ""sweetest moment of them all"" is going to result in the brutal deaths of several people.  The show's creators realize this as well: notice the immediate and total change in the music at this point as Jekyll prepares the fatal injection.  Besides, the limitations of Hasselhoff's singing voice do not bother me as much as the inconsistency I sense between his Jekyll & Hyde voices at time (again, it is his physical performance that is convincing).  On balance his performance was better than I would have expected and he certainly should earn points for the effort since, as the actor points out after the curtain calls, this role was ""no day at the beach"" (and every fan of ""Baywatch"" who checks this out is one small victory in the name of kulture over pop culture).
""Jekyll & Hyde: The Musical"" is one I would grade out at 3.5 stars, and so my rating is designed to nudge the overall score in that direction.  Whether you do so before or after seeing this filmed production, you should also listen to the Broadway cast album.",1041897600,17,2849,4.696787148594377

Back to the DVD, although most of the cast beside ""David Hasselhoff"" is quite well perform (but it been a very long time since he did musical when he is a child actor), I have to say the down side of this production are the stage direction and the design of the stage, it is not as good as Les Miserable (both in the transiation and the layout).  I personal think if this two elements can be redesign it well be a wonderful play, it is really far far from what I image as I listern to the concept album with Anthoy Warlow.

If you want to listen to a talented actor sing this role, look to Anthony Warlow in the concept album.  This is shear brilliance and beauty in a rare male broadway voice.  (though Anthony's voice shows clear operatic training)
Buy the concept album but DON'T, for you own health, but this DVD.  It's far too painful!!!!!",1040342400,5,718,4.860655737704918
1635377,3,B00005NKVF,"I agree with the other reviewers - David Hasselhoff should have stayed at the beach.  I saw this show twice on Broadway - once with Robert Cuccioli and once with Robert Evan. When I heard they were putting it on DVD, I naturally assumed they would use one of the original Jekyll's, who both did such a wonderful job. WRONG!!
Hasselhoff must have paid for the production.  That's the only reason I can see for having him ruin such a great show.  His singing is atrocious, his acting hammy (especially during the transformation scenes) and he totally ruined the song I waited to hear ""This is the Moment"".
Now having said all that, I still bought the DVD.  Why? I loved the play, the production itself is well done and the supporting players are all very good.
If any more Broadway shows are put on DVD (and they should be) they should use the cast that made the show a hit and not the one that sent it into oblivion.  (Hasselhoff closed J&H on Broadway.)",1040083200,,953,4.422857142857143
1635378,5,B00005NKVF,"BRAVO!!!BRAVO!!!! I am in love with this Broadway musical and all I can say is buy it, buy it, buy it!! David Hasselhof may not be a seasoned Broadway performer, but he did a fabulous job. His acting was great and his transformation from good to evil was convincing and powerful. Granted a song like ""This is the Moment"" commands a stronger voice,but he still pulled it off and sung it well. He is a convincing Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. You can see it in his face and his emotions.  As for the female leads, I am in love with them both. I can't get enough of their voices and appearances. Andrea Rivette is marvelous as Emma and her voice is truly angelic. Her rendition of ""Once Upon a Dream"" is beautiful. She is Emma through and through. I like her much better than Christine Noll and Carolee Carmello heard and seen on the original Broadway versions. Oh, by the way, Congratulations Andrea and Charles on your recent nuptuials!! Now I must talk about the star and most under rated of the entire cast, Coleen Sexton. I couldn't believe she was only 21 when she played Lucy Harris. Wow!! Not only is she a sight for sore eyes(she is beautiful and sexy!!!)her voice is powerful(not at all NASAL as others here have said) When power and strength in a voice is mistaken for nasal tones, that critic doesn't know about oratory capabilities.  Not only can she belt out a song, but she can act too. I can't say enough about her. She must do more musicals and performances. (An update) She will be doing an off Broadway musical called ""Heat Lightning"" (...) Thanks Christy for the update on Coleen.
George Merritt and Barrie Ingham are simply wonderful as well, and play their respective parts with such panache. The entire cast is marvelous and they hold my attention to the end. Just sit back and enjoy the mesmerizing songs such as,""This is the Moment"", ""The Fascade"", ""In His Eyes"", ""Good and Evil"", ""Murder, Murder"",""Once Upon a Dream"" and others.
I am appalled at all the negative comments made here. The hardest thing anyone can do in life is to get up and speak in front of an audience, right? Well, it must be even harder to get up on stage, sing, as well as act in front of hundreds of people ready to criticize your every movement, slip up, or crack of your voice. To all those critics, I say is, I would like to see you get up there and do a better job. May the first one who can, throw the first piece of fruit up on the stage. Shame on you all!! I think I may wear out this DVD before I ever get tired of it. It is constantly playing where my family is starting to think I am a little obsessed. Maybe I am. A good thing is hard to get enough of.
You know I wrote a more critical review after watching it the very first time, but after seeing it over and over again, my critical review became a rave review. I think at first I just was not convinced David was a Broadway performer, but after careful review, I did a quick 360 and I was hooked.
I hope this overrides my first review. I really want people out there to know that this  rendition of the greatest of Musicals is one of the best. Robert Cuccioli and Anthony Warlow were still great as Jekyll and Hyde,especially Anthony, but if you can't get enough of J&H, go out and buy this one. You will not be disappointed at all.  Thank Goodness they filmed this, so Broadway enthusiasts and Jekkies can enjoy great show anytime they choose. Jekkies, now you can have your fill of our favorite Broadway musicals. BRAVO!!!

I own the soundtrack and know how strong a singer you must be to hold up such difficult songs.  My assumptions were correct and Hasselhoff was shaky and weak with songs such as, ""This is the Moment.""  However, in his defense, he did do an exceptional acting job which almost balanced out the inexperienced singing.  As for the other actors, each one had their own sense of personality on stage, and they al performed with amazing talent.

1635382,5,B00005NKVF,"I forced myself to write a review of this wonderful DVD after reading all the horrible comments made about it recently. True, I do concede that it is maybe not the best version of the show, but it is still great on its own terms. I saw the show a year before this filming was made, with the same cast that's on the DVD minus David Hasselhoff. They were all just as superb as they are on this recording.
David Hasselhoff is not my first pick of favorite Jekyll and Hyde's, but he does do the part justice. I was expecting a lot worse. I was pleasantly surprised in several places. He is a deserving actor. His voice may be lacking in some parts, but overall I think he does a good job of making Jekyll's plight convincing.
Anyone who thinks the ensemble did anything other than a fantastic job is just insane. I love ""Facade"" and ""Murder, Murder"" and ""Good 'N' Evil."" They're stand-out pieces on this DVD.
Likewise, the two leading ladies' solos are beautiful and always bring a tear to my eye. Their ""In His Eyes"" is just as powerful and show-stopping as it was when I saw them sing it live.
The only real complaint I have about this DVD is the chapter selection. There are only twelve, and a production like this really deserves more. ""In His Eyes"" should have been given its own chapter, since I always fast forward to it on the ""Once Upon a Dream"" chapter, right after Andrea Rivette's beautiful solo, of course.

I love the entire cast featured on the Broadway cast version of the CD, mainly Linda Eder, who I love, but for something a bit different, instead of hearing Broadway trained actors playing Jekyll & Hyde (such as Anthony Warlow, Chuck Wagner and Bob Cuccioli), it would have been nice to hear someone who could really hit those high notes with some attitude!

Ms Eder has the voice and presence the video lacks. Cuccioli is a splendid actor whose transformation of Jekyll to Hyde was thrilling and far beyond the ability of Mr. Baywatch. Cuccioli, with use of body language and voice, makes two different characters believeable. His dialog between Jekyll and Hyde near the end was remarkable. Not so the video.

Unfortunatly he dosen't come close to meeting the vocal and acting challenges the dual roles require, and in the most intense scenes only succeeds in looking (and sounding) comical. Hasselhoff only looks more untalented next to the superb cast, namely Andrea Rivette and Collen Sexton.

1635393,4,B00005NKVF,"There are a number of childhood novels that I've always though would provide ideal material for an epic Broadway musical. And Robert Louis Stevenson's classic tale of Good and Evil has always been at the head of the list. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to see this musical when it when it played at the Fox here in Saint Louis. And the original cast recording really didn't conjure any images of the story when I listened to it. So when the Broadway production was videotaped, I just had to see it.
After viewing the tape I felt like Jekyll and Hyde myself. The show has both a good side and a decidedly bad side. Any theatrical production preserved for future generations automatically gets bonus points from me. Unfortunately few of the really great shows ever get a good theatrical video recording. And the ones that do usually are lesser works.
That's the case with this production which seems to be told by way of Sweeney Todd and Les Miz. The libretto is really stilted and drawn out, especially in the first act. The show  really doesn't start moving until the second act .The opening of which really works. Unfortunately, the finale is extremely weak. After Jekyll/Hyde's dramatic (but cliched) good vs. evil final scene, the end really seems tacked on. I think the last two scenes could have been combined for really dramatic close.
As for the music, Wildhorn's compositions still do nothing for me; though many people think they're really great and clamor for more. For me, it's just not memorable, and I can't understand why every song (EVEN THE BALLADS) have to end like a pop/rock recording with the over-amplified sounds of some drummer trying to drown out the singers. (I'm not even going to get into the tiny microphone bugs glued to everyone's face.)
David Hasselhoff also gets bonus points for having the guts to do a live musical theater when all of Broadway's stars seem to be leaving it for the tube or Hollywood. He gives a very credible performance, and I'm glad to see him use the classic John Barrymore technique for doing the character transformations. Unfortunately, he loses a couple of points for his tacky curtain speech.
My personal tastes and opinions aside, this tape was LIVE theatre delivered by a strong and talented cast, and as such I did enjoy it. You probably will, too",1014595200,2,2307,4.753117206982544

I am sad to say that this video was awful.  I cannot imagine how David Hasselhoff got this part anywhere much less Broadway.  I do not mean to be cruel to him, but he just cannot sing and his acting was a close second.  I could bearly sit through the entire video because I was actually so embarrassed for him.  I think the ""live"" audience was either his fan club or friends and family.  The most intense parts of the show were too forced on his part.  It was if he made certain he could sing just as loud at the intense parts of songs as past performers but his voice just does not have the quality of the others.  As I said, I do not mean to be mean to him, but I would really advise you not to buy this video unless you really like David Hasselhoff.",1013990400,,958,3.953125

I was horrified at his deplorable ""transformation"" when Hyde makes his first appearance and was equally disappointed at his final transformation at the wedding.  I'm not sure about anyone else, but I saw this version after hearing the pre-production album and visiting the website and after reading the novel, so I had some high expectations upon entering into the twilight zone that is David.  And, I am sad to say that those expectations were smashed into a thousand pieces as I watch in agony as David was writhing on the stage like a toddler throwing a tantrum in a department store.  I must say, that I have seen better high school productions.

Having seen Jekyll & Hyde on Broadway with Mr. Hasselhoff, the good news is that I can report that this video reproduction is very true to the original stage production.  The bad news is (also) that this video reproduction is very true to the original stage production!
Mr. Hasselhoff is more than an actor, he is a presence ... on the small screen, and particularly in those many situations in which he is required to remove his shirt and show off those pecs.  On Broadway however, acting and singing talent generally must carry the day, and Mr. Hasselhoff is, unfortunately, devoid of both.  Messrs. Wildhorn and Bricusse are worthy of MUCH better.
I can only say this to those who see this tape and stare in horror -- not at the story but at the terrible performance turned in by Mr. Hasselhoff:  could be worse!  You could have spent [amt] a ticket to see it up close and personal.  My friend and I did, (got first row seats, too, unfortunately) and had to hide our faces in each other's shoulders as we shook with laughter during Hasselhoff's climactic scene, singing to himself as both Jekyll and Hyde.

KITT could have done a much better job!!!",1006819200,,382,4.632352941176471
1635409,3,B00005NKVF,"Since many reviews have focused on the aspects of the production, I will add only one thought in that area: did they attempt to book the name leads for the taping?  I am sure that Linda Eder would have been interested in seeing her husband's most popular work shown in its best light.  With that said, I applaud any producer that tapes a Broadway musical at the end of it production.  I have purchased everyone produced by Sir Andrew and look forward to ones in the future.  If you like the musical I hope you will support it so that producers will consider other musicals in the future.  The other thing that people did not discuss in their reviews was the manner in which it was recorded - as two long tracks with no capability to select individual songs.  Please do not repeat this in future releases.  After watching two, or three times, I like to listen only to my favorite songs.  It cannot be done easily with this DVD.",1006819200,,926,4.405882352941177
1635410,5,B00005NKVF,"I was impressed by this video. David Hasselhoff acts in a real masterpiece. Brilliant work. It has been a long way from the beach to the broadway. This video proofs that David's work is good quality.
Just a tip: Listen to the music by turning off the TV speakers and using a hi-fi system.",1006732800,,288,4.351851851851852
1635411,3,B00005NKVF,"Okay, I will admit this first off: Hasselhoff wasn't as bad as I expected.  Of course, my expectations were so low that it's really not saying much.  Amazingly, he even isn't the worst Jekyll/Hyde to appear on Broadway, that award goes to the positively AWFUL Jack Wagner (not to be confused with Chuck Wagner!)  In addition, I didn't find his acting to be that bad...he tends to overact on screen, and that actually translates well to stage.  In fact, most of the actors overact a bit on the DVD, but it can't really be held against them because they are actually STAGE acting.
However, it is impossible to get past the fact that Hasselhoff struggles thoughout the show, expecially with the higher notes.  Sadly, his ""This Is The Moment"" is his weakest number.  It also shows that he is out of his league when measures needed to be cut from the ends of songs because of his lack of lung capacity (this happens in Moment and ""The Way Back"").
Coleen Sexton is easily the best part of the show.  While she doesn't have the strength of Linda Eder (who does??), she still performs very well, and her performance of ""A New Life"" is easily the best I've ever heard.
I can't figure out why everyone seems to like Andrea Rivette so much.  Personally, I couldn't stand her!  She sings though her nose the entire time, and when she hits the high notes (which she does with no problem) it becomes almost unbearable.  She certainly has the range, but her technique is just awful!
Finally, I'd like to shed some light on why Hasselhoff was cast.  The theatre people were out for a ""big name"" to draw people to see the show.  They started with Jack Wagner (ugh), then went to Sebastean Bach (Skid Row, whom I didn't see, but I hear was quite good), and finally Hasselhoff.  Unfortunately, more people saw the matinees with Joe Mahowald,who is the best Jekyll to play the role.  Mo offense to Mr. Cuccioli, but Joe has you beat!",1006300800,,1913,4.523255813953488

The only good song he had was the reprise of sympathy, tenderness in close to the end of act 2.  The rest of the cast shines, Lucy was the best, then emma, and the rest of the ensemble.

His acting is pathetic and he tends to worbble while holding notes. #2 This is the inferior Broadway production. Why they chose to film this production I'll never know. It's a badly butchard version of J&H. They should have filmed the US Tour. If you've never seen the tour though, you won't miss anything with this video
Now here's the good. Hasselhoff's Hyde is actually very good. He looks truely insane and sings certain parts in really different, really cool ways. The rest of the cast is brilliant. I don't think they could have casted them better if they tried. The camera work is also very good.

1635416,1,B00005NKVF,"David Hasselhoff has had no formal voice training and it shows in this production. He has no control, especially when it comes to virbratto. And to add to his lack of talent was a weak story with undeveloped characters. When some of these characters are killed, you feel nothing for them, because there seems to be no reason for them to exist in the first place. The film version seems chopped up. The music does not match the music on the soundtrack. If you were to buy this film for one song imparticular, ""Bring On The Men,"" you will be disappointed. It is not in this feature, and has been replaced by a rather horrible song, one which changes the personality of the character.",1005436800,,681,4.5

Although he may not have been the best, he is still amazing in the role, and not anywhere near as bad as some of these reviews make him out.

1635421,4,B00005NKVF,"Having seen the show on Broadway and being an avid fan of the show, I naturally had to get this DVD.  When I saw it, I anticipated David Hasselhoff's performance.  He was just laughable as Jekyll and Hyde!  Making up for him, however, was the rest of the cast.  Colleen Sexton was unbelievable as Lucy.  She fit the role very well and she sang all of her songs beautifully with that little extra emotion that you can't hear on the OBC soundtrack.  Andrea Rivette was wonderful also.  Her voice frighteningly resembles Christiane Noll's in every way.  I was priveleged to see Christiane as Emma and was pleased to see Andrea take over the role.  The supporting cast, which included Barrie Ingham and George Merritt, was good.  It was great to hear the extra orchestrations that are not found on the OBC.  The only thing the orchestra did wrong was the first arpeggio in ""In His Eyes.""  It is a most crucial chord in the musical, and the pianist had to ruin it.  Other than that and the title role himself, this Broadway capture is a wonderful addition to any collection.",1003190400,4,1069,4.563157894736842
1635422,3,B00005NKVF,"I bought the original soundtrack of Jekyll and Hyde before it was even brought to Broadway.  The album featured Anthony Warlow in the title role together with Linda Eder.  Both artist displayed superlative vocal prowess which made me look forward to seeing the play.  I bought the DVD release recently and was quite disappointed.  David H. might have the stage presence/star quality but he definitely lack the vocal ability to do justice to the songs, most especially ""this is the moment"". Even Mr. Hassellhoff's acting appeared weak.  I thought I was watching ""Baywatch meets Jack the Ripper""",1002672000,2,593,5.072164948453608
1635423,4,B00005NKVF,"Where is Chuck Wagner when he is badly needed. Mr. Wagner was the first Jekyll/Hyde in the world premiere in Huston and starred in the touring version. He was magnificant and sent chills through the audience. I have never heard anyone sing ""This Is the Moment"" as effectivally and I have all the recordings. His acting was unforgetable. So it was with this superb performance in mind that I watched David Hasselhoff attempt to play the part. He was pale indeed by comparison.
Mr. Hasselhoff is supposed to be a major record seller in Europe, if so, there must be a tremendous amount of electronic work done on his voice. He simply does not have a theatrical voice. This is particularly evident on the beautiful ""This Is The Moment"" which sounds very weak and not at all memorable in his rendition. As an actor, he is more effective as Hyde than as Dr. Jekyll. But it is a fact that villains are easier and more fun to play than the straight forward leads. Unfortunately, Mr. Hasselhoff is very stiff in his movements and simply looked OLD as Jekyll. He was probably the reason that the film was made, so we have to thank him for that, but he is far from the ideal choice.
The show itself has had a number of versions. When I saw the touring version, some of us were talking to the orchestra leader during the intermission and he stated that what we were seeing was a bit different from the Broadway show. The main change seemed to be that the wonderful song, ""No One Knows Who I Am"" for Lucy was replaced by ""Bring On The Men"".
Andrea Rivette, who is on the DVD, was also Emma in this tour. She was wonderful then and on the disk. She makes a believable love interest for Jekyll.
The supporting cast, as has been mentioned in most of the other reviews,is uniformally excellent on the DVD. Coleen Sexton as the unfortunate bar girl Lucy is worth the price of the DVD alone. For a 20 year old (as she is listed in the cast portion of the ""extras"") she gives a performance with memorable depth. She is also knock out beautiful!
It is wonderful that Broadway shows are being preserved on DVD, even with less than exciting leads. At least we have a record of what the Broadway show was. Anyone serious about musical theater should add this show to their collection. When I watch it, I block out Mr. Hasselhoff and remember Chuck Wagner.",1002585600,7,2331,4.4485981308411215
1635424,2,B00005NKVF,"The cast (except for David Hasselhoff) was superb.  And the filming of the musical is the best I've seen for a live production.  Especially memorable were the songs, ""In His Eyes"", ""A New Life"", and ""When This All Began"".  But Mr. Hasselhoff, for all of his 'star quality' was a profound disappointment.  ""This is the Moment"" should be a show-stopper, but his performance in this great musical scene was mediocre at best--really it was embarrassingly bad.  Mr. Hassellhoff proved that he can neither sing nor act on the stage.  What is it about producers of Broadway shows that induces them to cast 'stars' who can't sing?  Also, I found the screening edition warning (Property of Goodtimes...), repeatedly displayed on the video, to be ridiculous.  It truly damaged the video presentation.  All in all, this video was a true disappointment.",1002499200,2,841,4.9928057553956835
1635425,2,B00005NKVF,"Perhaps it's fitting that for the musical ""Jekyll & Hyde"", which concerns itself with the duality of man, that the quality of the production is at times superb, and at times atrocious.
This is, without a doubt, the most well-filmed Broadway stage musical I have ever seen. It also contains some of the poorest performance as well. Unfortunately, ""10 high-definition cameras"" cannot make up for the fact that David Hasselhoff is lousy in the title role. His singing is weak, his acting is weaker. This is the man who was responsible for closing the show's New York run; what more need be said?
It's too bad the producers of this DVD didn't choose to film the cast which toured the US two years ago. Not only did that cast feature the superb Chuck Wagner as the title characters, but it was far more well staged. It also included songs that had previously been cut from the Broadway incarnation; ""I Need to Know"", ""Bring on the Men"", and others.
As this DVD stands, it is all too obviously a last-ditch moneymaking scheme by the producers of the show, which closed shortly after this was filmed. Good production values, good supporting cast; but 85% of the time, the stage is occupied by Hasselhoff. Which means that 85% of the time, I'm thinking about turning the volume down and listening to either Anthony Warlow or Bob Cuccioli instead.",1002067200,15,1338,4.697872340425532

Coleen Sexton is my favorite performer in this show. True her voice isn't as good as Linda Eders but it is still strong and powerful and her acting is amazing. The rest of the cast is great but she really stood out to me. So get this if you want a good movie, but don't expect much from David because in my opinion he stinks.",1001289600,,501,4.175257731958763
1635427,4,B00005NKVF,"Much has been made of the fact that TV star David Hasselhoff was playing the title roles in JEKYLL AND HYDE, the hit Broadway musical based on the classic horror story of the doctor who brings out his evil self through the use of chemicals.  Some critics thought he was a lightweight and a stiff pretty boy, however they seem a little off the mark on this one.  Aside from the occasionally odd pop-stylings in his singing and a touch of hamminess as Hyde, Hasselhoff does a fairly solid job.  He holds his own quite nicely in what, despite his top billing, turns out to be a well-balanced production.  Opera singer George Merritt is quite sympathetic as Jekyll's friend and lawyer, Utterson, although he doesn't get to show off his voice much in mainly a character role.  Barrie Ingham provides warmth as Sir Danvers Carew, while Andrea Rivette is a winsome Emily.  While not on a par as Linda Eder, who created the role, Coleen Sexton makes a sexy turn as the ill-fated Lucy.  The rest of the cast is just as solid, handling their songs with skill.  The 10 camera set-up does a wonderful job of bringing the production up close, as well showing off some of the fast-paced staging.  Robert Louis Stevenson's classic story is not your typical plotline for musical theatre, but JEKYLL AND HYDE is a fairly successful attempt, and a top-notch DVD capture of a Broadway show.  Definitely recommended for fans of the musical.",1001203200,14,1420,4.666666666666667
1635428,4,B00005NKVF,"I saw Jekyll and Hyde when it first opened on Bway in 1996 and instantly fell in love with it. The beautiful songs, the gothic romance story and the killer performances from Robert Cuccioli, Linda Eder, and Christine Noll. All had the most exquisite voices I have ever heard, and each song was sung with such strength and emotion. The videotaped version is very high quality and has done a tremendous job at bringing the stage version to the small screen. The songs still are brilliant including Take Me As I Am, Someone Like You, This is the Moment, A New Life, and the stunning duet In His Eyes. Andrea Rivette as Emma is very good. Acting is good and she has a lovely voice, but she brings nothing new to the role that Christine Noll created. She seems bored. Colleen Sexton as Lucy the whore is certainly sexy and has quite a marvelous voice, but the songs Someone like You and A New Life were written for Linda Eder(the best female vocalist ever!) and she does not come even close to her. Her acting is very strong but here voice is not mature enough to hit the high notes and she sometimes comes across as screaming(however, her rendition of A New Life is simply marvelous). In His Eyes by Lucy and Emma is and has remained the highlight song of the show. Both actresses sing this song with alot of energy and emotion and it sent chills up my back. David Hasslehoff is bad. His acting is boring and his singing is flat and forced. He is definetly not trained properly. I'm sure David would have been better in a different role but Jekyll and Hyde is too diffucult a role for a newcomer to handle and he tries and tries but faild, although I do give him props for tackling such a hard role to play. I can't understand why Frank Wildhorn would allow them to tape this without the original cast especially his wife Linda Eder who should have been called to do the taping. All that aside....Jekyll and Hyde is still a thrill to watch and I will continue to watch it over and over again. I'm not saying the cast(except David H) is bad, they are all amazing but they lack the excitment and power that the Orig Bway cast had.

So, I'm not sure if it is a good thing that the Dolby 5.1 Soundtrack is very well mixed and impressive. I hate the fact that this DVD is not divided into tracks because it makes it harder to skip the Hastlehoff numbers. He is out of his element here... he makes no effort to create character for Henry Jekyll and his Mr. Hyde characterization stops at his hair and Spooooky voice. He is uncomfortable in his body, and this is the most labored performance I have seen since the Gary Condit interview with Connie Chung. If you've got the money, it is worth it just to get a sense of what this show could be with someone like Colm Wilkinson or Anthony Warlow in the part.

Though his voice is large, it lacks the finesse and range of the lead in this musical.  However, the supporting cast is superb!!!  They make the DVD worth purchasing.  The sound quality is also VERY good.

Many of them carrying two roles, just like David Hasselhoff who was exellent as BOTH Dr. Henry Jekyll and Edward Hyde. Sometimes I seriously thought that I was looking at two different actors for the two characters. The best song in the whole thing was while Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde fought. Each trying for control.

I had an absolute BLAST seeing Sebastian Bach rip through the entire show. Sebastian has a phenomenal voice: he is !EDWARD HYDE! to the utmost! The only thing that I cannot fault Sebastian on is that as he really did not have an opportunity to truly ACT prior to JEKYLL & HYDE, his portrayal as HENRY JEKYLL lacked the polish and poise that an upper-middle class doctor should have... But, given the time, and the opportunity, I foresee an extremely talented actor. BUT!!! The reason that Sebastian ROCKED as Edward Hyde, is that that was his (Sebastian's) persona on stage as a heavy-metal rocker. As I never really watched either ""Knight-Rider"" or ""Baywatch"", I am in no position to say 'yea' or 'nay' to David's acting ability. I was in NYC, and I purchased a ticket to see David as I was curious about how he would do... I was pleasantly surprised! He can indeed act, and his voice is very good! It was a life-long dream of David's to be on Broadway, and in a musical, and I think he more than acquitted himself! I look forward to watching his career in the future, and if David should ever find himself on Broadway, I shall definitely be in the Audience at one point!
