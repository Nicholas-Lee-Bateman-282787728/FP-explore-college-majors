7905947,5,6305194653,"I injured myself a few months ago while trying to do some cartwheels, I apparently injured a small muscle in the groin area, what I learned from this is that  [1] your gait when walking begins in the groin area and an injury there seriously affects your mobility [2] after fifty years of age an injury could quite possibly create permanent ramifications [3] don't try to do cartwheels after a certain age. Wai Lana has many exercises on this DVD ,most of them I works for me and a couple I thought I did not personally need to incorporate into my stretching routine. While as you age you are not suppose to become more flexible the groin / pelvic stretch I am now doing as instructed on this DVD has me limbering up in an area I have never even considered stretching before, the stretch was not easy at first but with practice I have nearly perfected it and my gait is stronger than before, there is also some great stomach strengthening exercises for posture and lower back pain. The bottom line is you can use many of these exercises to personalize a routine that you can do anywhere, anytime and every day for overall strength and wellness.",1378512000,3,1143,4.4951923076923075

7905951,5,6305194653,This dvd woke me up and got my blood pumping. For me the asanas were a  stretch and I got a good workout.,1178582400,4,105,3.5652173913043477
7905952,5,6305194653,"Her 30 min yoga DVDs are always soothing yet energize me. I'm never bored & almost always disapointed it's over after 30 min.
She speaks slowly, gracefully with beautiful outdoor locations to look at & beautiful, soothing, but not annoying music in the background. She performs them in colorful outfits & too much makeup, but we can blame the producers for that. She is always correct in knowing where you will feel the energy during & after the pose. She also tells you what the poses help your body with both muscularly, neurologicall & organs to keep you going.
The pace is relaxed & relaxed & she lets you take short breaks in between each one.
This one like her others has a play feature, extras contains: tell you seperately in pics what the asana helps with for organs or muscles, extra info on how to do it, customizing the working by deciding which poses to do or do repeatedly, guidelines/helpful hints if tired/weak & temperature of the room, fan speak/testimonials & more items to buy.
The poses are: uijayi energizing breath w/slight back arch, side to side triangle, right angle standing twist, cat twist, tiger pose/hands/knees leg lift, resting frog, inverted half boat kinda cobra, easy half locust, sitting fwd bend/straight leg, slope stetch kinda like bridge, bent knee sitting twist, leg lifts, beginner's plough, knee to chest stretch, ab twist with straight legs, yoga nidra & 5 min meditation/chant.",1162512000,12,1423,4.908713692946058
7905953,3,6305194653,"Well, it sounds like other people really loved this video but I found it just ok.  I think that it is very slow and not so good for people who prefer a faster paced style of yoga.  I must admit, you do still feel like you have worked out, because although a lot of the positions are easy, she holds them for so long that they get strenuous.  And as for the scenery, a lot of people found it beautiful, which it is, but I just found it to be a bit cheesy.  Hope that helps for any inquiring yogi's.",1115078400,,497,3.94
7905954,5,6305194653,"I have done yoga for years, and most videos that I buy I try once or twice and then they sit on the shelf.  Wai Lana's are the best yoga videos I've seen.  I've given some as presents just to inspire friends and relatives to get into yoga! This one is especially good for people who aren't afraid to really challenge themselves, but even beginners could still follow along.  The changing natural settings are so beautiful and the music so peaceful that sometimes I just sit and watch it to pacify my mind.  This one is really energizing, no dull spots like a lot of yoga videos I've seen.  Great for people who really want to get into yoga.",1075939200,,640,4.34453781512605
7905955,5,6305194653,"I started to do Wai Lana's GoodBye Inertia video a month ago and I can't beleive all the benefits so far! After each session my whole body feels so refreshed! This paricular video is so great for the waist and lower body. It is not a strenous program but at the end of it I really feel like I got a good workout. I've tried other yoga videos but none of them make me feel the way Wai Lana does. Her voice is so calming and reassuring. She is an excellent guide during the poses, explaining all the benefits for each of them. She is not intimidating at all like other yoga instructors. I love the relaxation part at the end of the video, it has such a calming effect on my mind! I would definitely recommend this video to new comers like me, after a month I can already notice my improvement on holding the poses longer and being more flexible, it's great! Thank you so much Wai Lana!",1073520000,,883,4.2
