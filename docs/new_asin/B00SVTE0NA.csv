6993223,5,B00SVTE0NA,"Loved it.  Bad boy stranger from out of town - boy meets girl.. boy falls for girl... boy tries to eat girls boyfriend.  Really wish someone would have eaten my ex in high school.  But wait... more complications.  Nothing's really simple in this movie, but in the end - it is.  Good movie, creepy coming of age story about someone who is always coming of age.  Lot of heart.  I like the weird ambience in this flick - very twin peaks without the vertigo.  The small town chief of police and his wife are great.  Like the Munsters... we are all so strange we don't notice how weird we are.  Rory Saper great performance. Sensitive,violent and a little cold. Nice cameo appearance by Kim Coates (Sons of Anarchy) He is actually the creepiest person there, as always.  Loved the ending.  Aw shucks, you are a bloodsucking murderer, not a cute 16 year old boy? Well... we love ya anyway!  Have another piece of pie.",1426204800,16,911,4.4817073170731705

6993225,1,B00SVTE0NA,This movie would have been good if it were 60 minutes shorter. Snooze fest.,1426032000,,75,4.428571428571429
6993226,4,B00SVTE0NA,Great teen story and thriller,1425686400,,29,5.0
6993227,5,B00SVTE0NA,"""Hunted"" is a film that was released in 2012 under the title ""Rufus"" which I feel is a more fitting title. Regardless of what title it's under,it is a great vampire  film.

Rufus shows up in a small town after his very elderly ward delivers him there, she then steps in front of a bus and he is alone. Before she dies he promises her he will try and blend in. He then moves in with a family who lost a son in a terrible accident. The man of the family just happens to be the sheriff,which could either be a blessing or a curse!

It's very reminiscent of (Let The Right One In) only The vampire is a boy of about 15 or 16 named Rufus and he finds an understanding girl who lives across the street who falls in love with him. This really isn't a horror film but more of a Thriller/Drama although there is a fair amount of blood in some scenes.

The rest of the film is very moving as Rufus tries to blend in and feed his hunger too. He's very much like the HBO character Dexter in that he only feeds on people that are bad or a danger to him or someone he loves. A mysterious stranger comes to the small town soon after Rufus arrives and he has an agenda and it isn't a pleasant one.

All the performances were good but ""Rory J Saper"" as Rufus was amazing and heart tugging. This is a vampire film with heart and it has a nice soundtrack too. I will buy this and re watch it because I found the characters endearing and I cared what happened to them. I love this film.",1425600000,29,1466,4.041379310344827
6993228,4,B00SVTE0NA,"I don't like typical ""vampire"" movies but this was as good as Byzantine.  Give it 20 minutes or so",1527984000,,98,4.157894736842105
6993229,5,B00SVTE0NA,"Relationship and personalities reminded me of main characters from End of The F*ing World. Maybe even Fargo because of the snow and cop investigating murders. I loved the movie and how it ended. You only have one scene where there are nonspeaking extras at the vet/temporary morgue. I'm glad the sheriff's son's story was explained, but wish there had been more clarification on what really went on at the hospital and if rumors about the girl were true. I'm sure she was supposed to be looking for love because of daddy issues, but it left it unclear. I watched the Amazon trailer and then one on YouTube call ""Rufus Official Movie Trailer"". Put those two together and that's the vibe of the actual movie.",1527465600,,706,4.701612903225806
6993230,5,B00SVTE0NA,"Very interesting take on a vampire movie. I do not think I have ever seen anything quite like it before. It is unrealistic in the sense that people would never accept Rufus the way the people in the movie did, but since vampires are unrealistic to begin with that is just par for the course. When reading fiction, we are supposed to have a willing suspension of disbelief anyway. The acting was top notch, in my opinion. I am not a movie critic so that is about all I have.",1527206400,,473,4.266666666666667
6993231,5,B00SVTE0NA,Absolutely adore this movie... Love to see a sequel... They could take the plot so many different ways from this ending. Excited to tell people...

6993236,5,B00SVTE0NA,"While the cretins at rotten tomatoes seem to think the movie was a bore, I personally found it to be a nice retelling.

In the same vein that Maggie was a zombie movie, Hunted is a vampire movie. It's less about the jump scares and gore and more about the human element.

While it leaves a lot to be desired in terms of explanation, it gives you a very real, very believable character that's trying to understand what's going on and why people are the way they are, further more, despite the treatment he's received at the hands of others, he still has this naive innocence that's touching and simultaneously sad.",1525392000,,613,4.513513513513513

6993242,3,B00SVTE0NA,"I'll start off by saying I liked it. In fact, it is one of those films that I find myself reminiscing on fondly.

It's with that preface I'll say it's a pleasant film, but in much the same way as a Christmas ornament a five year old creates is pleasant. You can see the intent and heart behind it, but if you seriously critique it, you just feel like a jerk.

The characters are lovable. Their heads are circles with smiley faces, each showing a few attempts to draw a nose in the middle, ultimately erased. Their behavior is irrational, and inconsistent, and bizarre, and you love the way the yellow-haired one was clearly based on the five year old's uncle Ben, whom they visited just last weekend. The relationships go through the highs and lows one might expect from playtime with Ken and Barbie, with some harsh words exchanged, and some tender, but all with such great conviction.

I would be negligent if I did not praise the acting, which was quite good all the way around. The solid performances kept the whole thing from unraveling, in my opinion.",1523059200,,1057,4.552631578947368
6993243,4,B00SVTE0NA,"Strangely...I liked it.  Way up from my original which was a 'disappoint', but I stayed with it until the end.  I was a little concerned that the suicide was a bad idea that would lead the hunter to find Rufus, but as it turns out all he really needed was to find the right people and it seems he did.  The suicide turns out to not be a bad thing, but an effort to reveal himself, be accepted for who he was, and finally find a home after 100s of years.  Where does he go from here?  In the reality of his lifespan, he will remain a teenager while everyone else ages around him.  When this family moves on to the hereafter and all else dies, he will be forever the oldest living teenager in Conrad.",1522886400,,698,4.095588235294118
6993244,5,B00SVTE0NA,"Immaculate editing; I think I caught one long cut, meaning a scene that is cut late by about a quarter second. Music was perfect, acting was a perfect fit for all roles and writing was believable all the way through even with a complex set of characters and plot lines. Also, strangely, I almost always see a jarring disconnect between practiced actors and young adult or young actors on film - that wasn't visibly present here either with great directing, or herculean directing as the case may be, or with concise editing.

I expected a more or less competent horror / 30 Days of Night / Let Me In clone with the always entertaining Kim Coates that I might or might not need to mute into the background; this turns out to be a much more than that. Hope it was as entertaining to make as it was to see, and I hope we see more work like this.",1522713600,,842,4.29559748427673

6993248,5,B00SVTE0NA,"It looked a little low budget, but don't let that keep you from enjoying a great story.

A young, illiterate boy finds himself in a town where he once lived so long ago that the people living there now would have forgotten him, or never known of him. He is taken into the care by the local chief of police and his wife, who lost their son in a tragic accident some time ago.

This story is not the stereotypical sex-blood-gore vampire movie we have grown so accustomed to, but rather introduces the story of one lone, possibly ancient vampire into modern rural America.

6993256,3,B00SVTE0NA,It was overall a decent movie. Just wished there was a little more action. I also feel the relationship between Rufus and Tracey was too rushed. The ending was also very anticlimactic.,1520208000,,184,4.78125

6993267,4,B00SVTE0NA,Its much better than I anticipated but its more of a romance drama than a horror movie. Not much that can be said that won't be a spoiler but it really didn't need to be 110-minutes long and hiring an editor who knew how to cut would have made this an excellent 90-minute movie. don't expect much from it because its more about hiding than hunted.,1515888000,,347,4.2727272727272725
6993268,4,B00SVTE0NA,"As a disclaimer, I rarely rate movies 5-stars, so a 4-star rating from me means it's definitely worth watching.

I feel like most of the people who rated this poorly were expecting the classic vampire thriller. This movie definitely exists outside that genre, which is one thing I really liked about it. There are some interesting tropes explored here that aren't as common in this genre. Another plus; given the intentional vagueness of the backstory, it requires some thought and attention (something I feel like a lot of low-reviewers didn't do--they constantly found supposed plot holes that were hinted at, if not outright explained, in the film).

This isn't an action film and the pacing reflects that fact. If you like films like Let the Right One In (either version), you should definitely watch this. It's not quite as solid a movie, but still thoroughly enjoyable.",1515888000,2,875,4.986301369863014

His illiteracy is never explained nor does it ever direct the plot or cause any dramatic tension. It's just a cute romantic joke to the filmmakers. That's right. She gives him a preschooler's ABC book for his first day at school.
What's more, the film's timing is off, the pace is lazy, the story meanders, the ""soundtrack"" is really just an alt-pop playlist that doesn't mesh with the predominantly gray and stark cinematography. Many characters had well developed back stories, like a family recovering from tragic loss, or a girl with a checkered past and poor self-esteem, but these promising sketches never develop into full-blown characters.
It felt like an attempt to blend Twilight with a humorless version of Fargo, which isn't of itself a bad idea for a film. This one just never got interesting.",1508284800,,1007,4.826589595375722

Horror movies are notoriously poorly reviewed by people who are not fans of the genre and really they should just stop reviewing them because it screws up the distribution for fans. In Hunted, you have your usual transient coming to town and the unfolding mystery around his arrival.

6993340,4,B00SVTE0NA,"Thoughtful and enjoyable, so I gave it a 4-star rating. It probably is more of a 3.75 because the characters are my favorite part and not favorite part. My biggest complaint is I felt the level of intensity was low for every character interaction. I'm going to split the blame between writing, acting, and direction.  When something truly fantastic or horrifying occurs, normal people react at that level. I wanted the movie to hit that crescendo, however, it didn't quite make it. Kind of like this review, which does not go into specifics. (I'm sure someone else wrote a plot summary.) So, don't take it too seriously and have a good time with it.

It has adult themes, teen love, sexual situations, and insinuated sex, but no nudity and no F-Bombs( 99%sure).",1506816000,6,764,4.7368421052631575

As it was, the acting was top notch and aside from a few choppy cuts, the directing was pretty great as well. The story line is an original and a departure from the usual vampire fare. It takes its own sweet time getting around to a clear-cut answer concerning Rufus and where he came from, adding a decent level of mystery. The movie is obviously low budget but the producers really did a terrific job for what they had to work with. Maybe next time they'll have enough money to invest in a sound track that isn't so distracting, but even that can be forgiven with the other aspects of the movie making up for its musical shortcomings.",1506384000,2,712,4.401515151515151

The story? Where is it going and what is it trying to tell us? As is, it isn't much more than a campfire tale of curiosity.
Most of the characters seem to act, excuse me, out of character. How?  Well, an old woman kills herself horrifically in front of the one she has taken care of for almost a century. Yes, she is tired, but this is the act of a cruel or selfish person, which, she clearly is not. The Sheriff, (well played by David Elliot) who seems to be a reasonable, thinking, conservative person suddenly decides to take in an obviously neurotic teenager. Aaron von Dusen (Kim Contes) who is well aware of the danger, ignores it. Then there is Rufus, who has apparently lived for a long, long time but acts pretty much like a typical teenager with all of the experience of the typical teenager. A predator like this would have to have a descent memory in order to survive and yet this kid can't remember anything about his origins.",1506297600,,1033,4.465608465608466

6993398,3,B00SVTE0NA,"I have no idea what I just watched. If you're interested in seeing a film that leaves you nonplussed, I'd highly recommend this.

I initially had a lot of difficulty accepting the premise that a hot girl next door would be interested in the new skinny, awkward, scrawny boy next door. That plot hole was filled in nicely when we find out she's slept with about half the town. Thankfully, the lead character is a vampire and presumably immune to STDs. If not, I couldn't imagine the hell of having crotch rot for eternity.

Even if it's not as dangerous as the sarlacc pit between her legs, she's clearly got some attachment and emotional issues. Right now she likes you, but what happens when the next vampire comes along? Or what if she suddenly thinks werewolves are hotter, and dumps your ass? He just moved to town and she jumped on him like a predator.

Seriously, dude needs to think this through before his undead heart gets crushed by this shiksa.

That said, I'm not upset that I watched it. It answers the question: ""What would a brooding, awkward teenager be like if he was over a hundred years old?""

Another minor problem I had was that the main character (warning minor spoiler) seemed to be very much a spectator in his own life.  This was quite evident in by him being illiterate even after being over 100 years old.  Except for being able to throw a baseball well, and having an encyclopedic knowledge about the sport, he seemed to have picked up no other skills, no wisdom, no charm, etc...

6993439,5,B00SVTE0NA,"In an era of pretty-boy vampire films and TV shows, it is refreshing to have a film like 'Hunted' come along. I cannot stand Twilight, the Vampire Diaries, or much else coming out of Hollwood these days pertaining to the vampire genre. The notable exception for me is none other than Guilermo del Torros' current FX series, 'The Strain'. In my mind, vampire books and movies are supposed to scare the hell out of you--no ifs, ands, or buts. When I noticed the main protagonist In 'Hunted' appeared to be a tween heartthrob, I was worried this film would be another melodramatic and sappy romance with a 21st century supernatural twist. Instead, I am happy to relate that I found myself throughly entertained by a unique film somewhat reminiscent of 'Let the Right One In.' This movie is a gem of a find for vampire-flick fans like myself for several reasons. Without giving away too much of the plot, I found the premise of a centuries old 'lost boy' in rural America as compelling and interesting as J.M. Barrie's notion of the fictional Peter Pan in Victorian London. Both stories, although very different, kindle the imagination in ways that other stories have not for me. Rory J Saper's portrayal of the vampire Rufus in 'Hunted' was nothing less than brilliant. My skepticism evaporated quickly as the peculiar plot played out. I became spellbound as I followed the daily struggles of Rufus, an extraordinary boy who simply wanted to live the life of an American teenager in rural America. The development of his emotional attachment to his new guardian-parents, and the pursuit of his vivacious next door neighbor gave this supernatural movie just the right amount of realism and allowed for terrific character development that is sorely lacking in most films that deal with Supernatural phenomena. The story might have been a bit slow in the beginning, but events flowed together nicely and the movie became progressively interesting as Rufus began to explore and adapt to his new environment. Rufus was generally a silent character--but at times he could be quite volatile(much like your average teenager). His past remained muddled throughout the movie and was never throughly explained, and his future seemed as unpredictable as the twists and turns in the plot of the movie. There were many informational gaps in the fabric of the story and it was fun trying to figure out what was going on and what might happen next. Too much information divulged too often invariably leads to a very predictable movie and 'The Hunted' was anything but predictable. I loved this aspect of the film most of all. The other actors all did a superb job as well--particularly his would-be foster parents who convincingly struggled with the reality that their new ward was anything but the sweet 15 year old he seemed to be. Rufus can be considered a monster in this film; it was hinted that his condition was a hereditary abnormality and that he was a one-of-a-kind freak of nature. **Spoiler Alert** He murdered two people in the course of the movie. Nevertheless, one cannot help but empathize with our boyish, bloodsucking protagonist. Rufus for the most part seemed far more human than his victims, many of whom deserved their violent ends(although this point is debatable). The musical soundtrack and moody background music throughout the movie were fantastic. I loved the ending, and am pleased that so many other reviewers did too. This is truly a unique vampire film with heart. I highly recommend this gem of a movie to any and all fans of vampire movies since so many films in this overly exploited genre are tired and predictable.",1433030400,3,3632,4.8977272727272725

6993454,1,B00SVTE0NA,"Where to begin with this off-putting film...

I don't really understand any of the positive reviews this movie has received -- I guess I must have seen something completely different. ""Hunted"" starts out by building what I thought was genuine intrigue, however this quickly becomes undone after the first 15 to 20 minutes. Disappointingly, this film dissolves into pure boredom and tediousness; never to recover. The main character, Rufus, is a quiet yet slightly odd teenager with a mysterious past. He also happens to be a ""vampire,"" although not in the traditional sense (you find this out pretty quick). Rufus, through some strange series of events, finds himself alone in some tiny, middle-of-nowhere town. After a seemingly random accident, Rufus is reluctantly taken in by the good Sheriff of said town.

It became apparent from the start that writer-director Dave Shultz struggles with character development. This fact is only more emphasized as the story moves along -- slowly, I might add. Questions about why Rufus is the type of vampire he appears to be, are not answered at all. How did he become a prisoner of his former captures? What is his plan? What are his motivations? Answers to these questions are important, because the audience needs to understand Rufus; to sympathize and care for him. The other characters are unlikeable for the most part, except for maybe Kelly Rowan's (Jennifer -- the Sheriff's wife/girlfriend).

I will give an example of the poor character development, as well as how unlikeable they are (also slight spoiler in this description):

Tracy, who is Rufus' love interest, lives next door to the Sheriff and is essentially forced into the story by initially interacting with Rufus in a way I found very puzzling and unrealistic. She starts by asking Rufus things that most people would not ask the very first time you meet someone. For example, she invites him into her house (as she is home alone) and immediately asks him if he wants to ""play a game."" She then proceeds to strip off all her clothes, and pressures him to do the same! So yes, they both are in her house completely naked, and all of this occurs inside of the first 10 minutes she meets him! Who does this? It felt completely out of place, and forced. Needless to say, the audience's impression of her just goes downhill from this point on, which is a problem due to it being the first impression that she makes. Adding to the already skewed and unfortunate characterization of Tracy, is the fact that the actress portraying her offered up a rather unconvincing performance overall.

As for the rest of the cast, the acting had all the trappings of a low-budget, wannabe horror movie. There were also problems with the plot in general. From unrealistic character motivations to typical human behavior, there were just too many inconsistencies in the overall story that kept it from being a cohesive film. There was nothing to anchor the progression of the plot down; something that would have tied everything together. Also, for a movie that is billed as one of horror there are literally zero scares. There are a few obvious clich&eacute;s and predictable moments, but nothing memorable. The music in this film, to me, perfectly reflects the poor choices that made the story incoherent and arduous. It seemed like the music didn't fit with what you were watching on the screen. ""Hunted"" was longer than it needed to be and finally gave way to a very lackluster climax, which of course is always a let down.

Seriously, the trailer made this movie look way more interesting than it actually is. I'm disappointed that I spent more than 3 dollars just to rent this very bland offering. I do not recommend it. ""Hunted"" is not a scary (or even interesting) horror movie about a vampire -- it's an episode of Dawson's Creek with a weird, new-age vampire in it.",1429401600,14,3864,4.846969696969697

6993461,4,B00SVTE0NA,"I actually really enjoyed this film, it was a quite original story, and the setting for it in a small northern town really fit the feelings which were being outlined for the main character.
The two caveats I have against it are, several of the main characters could have been fleshed out better, especially the father and our interesting, stranger who is looking for our main character.
The other is that the movie is kind of slow at a few points.
Overall this isn't a story that blew me away, but I enjoyed the inventive nature of it, and I really like when film makers take a stab of doing something new and unique when it comes to the oldie but goodie themes, vampires, werewolves, Frankenstein and so forth....
I mean don't get me wrong the classic presentations are nice, but there is a lot of stuff that hasn't been tapped yet, with these themes, and this movie I feel certainly took a stab at doing something fairly original.
If you are looking for high vampire action this isn't it, or for that matter, there really isn't much for ""horror"" per say in this film, its really a character study.... but if you enjoy a movie that looks at the concept of vampirism in a more intellectual light, you may find this movie enjoyable.",1428364800,3,1231,4.5

I gave it 5 stars because I did like maybe even enough to purchase in the future.,1428192000,,437,4.2926829268292686
6993464,1,B00SVTE0NA,"OMG, poke my eyes out....I cant believe I watched this entire stupid movie.  If you like the twilight series you will probably like this...",1427760000,,139,4.791666666666667
6993465,4,B00SVTE0NA,"This was a great twist on the vampire story. The acting was excellent. There are so many crappy vampire movies, but this one was great! Refreshing. I bought it and would buy it again.",1427673600,,183,4.411764705882353
6993466,5,B00SVTE0NA,"Amazing.  Not the bloody vampire flick that we typically see.  Different genre.  More like ""Let Me In.""",1427587200,,103,4.9411764705882355

6993470,3,B00SVTE0NA,"It is a fun interpretation of vampires. What it had going for it in the beginning somewhat slowed down, as opposed to winding up for a climactic ending.",1427328000,,152,4.464285714285714
6993471,1,B00SVTE0NA,this was a horrible movie and not worth the money.,1427328000,,50,4.1
6993472,5,B00SVTE0NA,"Fantastic movie. The kid that plays Rufus was so good, I can't wait to see him in more movies. The story was a creative take on a traditional concept. It's not really a horror movie, just a good vampire flick. Like other people said, it's like Let the Right One In meets.... Something else... (Sorry, I'm not creative.)",1427241600,,319,4.517241379310345

6993474,1,B00SVTE0NA,The trailer showed the main scenes of the movie and gave it the impression it was more dramatic than it really was.,1427155200,,115,4.2727272727272725
6993475,1,B00SVTE0NA,How can anyone compare this to let the right one in? It's more like Twilight and I really thought twilight sucked,1426896000,2,113,4.428571428571429
6993476,5,B00SVTE0NA,"If you like Twilight or anything with glitter, don't watch this movie.  If you truly appreciate a real vampire story, watch this movie.  This is not a horror movie.  This is a thought provoking and emotional movie.  Not for the simple minded.",1426809600,2,242,4.690476190476191
6993477,5,B00SVTE0NA,"At long last....a movie that has a great story, cute talented actors and a good ending and the bad guys get put where they belong. Down the gullet, so to speak. The young man that played Rufus I hope to see in major motion pictures. He has screen presence for miles. He will develop hopefully into an actor with a long and rich career. He seems to have the stuff.",1426809600,,363,4.2
6993478,4,B00SVTE0NA,A surprisingly well made film.,1426636800,,30,5.2
6993479,1,B00SVTE0NA,"You call this a vampire movie..? What happened to the days of blood and guts and complete mayhem.. This movie sucked ass rather then blood, and that's being kind.. Stop giving us morbid dead romance, I want to see vampires hunting, killing and sucking the life out of their prey..",1426636800,3,280,4.62
6993480,5,B00SVTE0NA,"Love, love this movie. Engrossing and emotional with a perfect ending.  It has the same kind of pacing and atmosphere like ""Let the right one in"" but with a bit more depth to the characters.",1426377600,2,190,4.428571428571429
6993481,5,B00SVTE0NA,"A totally different take on the same genre of vampire movies. Well acted, with a character study of a tortured boy and the girl who cares. Another vampire enters the scene to try and take him home. A smart cop played by David James Eliot who really cares. The intelligent script kept me interested until the ending.",1426377600,4,315,4.543859649122807
6993482,4,B00SVTE0NA,"For what it is, it's a pretty decent movie. Decent acting, doesn't look low budget. It's more of a drama movie than anything, the image for the movie makes it out to be something it's not, not even close. It had an interesting story to it and was confusing at times for what exactly was the cause of everything but it eventually unfolded.

My biggest issue with the movie was the fact that it seemed like the entire town had zero reaction to what he was. Every single person was truthfully like ""oh you're a vampire? that's cool...."". I mean it was mind boggling how unaffected people were when they found out. The reactions were even less than it was in the Twilight series.",1426204800,,675,4.443548387096774
6993483,5,B00SVTE0NA,Awesome and definitely worth renting.,1426204800,,37,6.6
6993484,5,B00SVTE0NA,"If you enjoyed ""Let Me In"" or Let the Right One In, then this is a 'must see' vampire flick. It's not Twilight nor it is Stoker's Dracula, but is equally entertaining. The storyline has a bit of an original premise to it and it flowed well. I felt the acting was very well done by all.
I absolutely LOVED the ending!",1426204800,13,316,4.112903225806452

Thank you!!",1533254400,,54,5.111111111111111
8699487,5,B00SVTE0NA,Nice slow burn horror with some interesting twists on the common vampire trope.,1532995200,,79,5.153846153846154

8699490,5,B00SVTE0NA,"What an interesting surprise. I didn't think this would be any good but I loved it.  Rory J. Saper!  Wow.  He's so young and he does such an understated, affecting job with the role.  He is one to watch.  He shows a natural sensitivity that's hard to come by.  And the veteran actors are great to watch in this too.  Found the whole thing strangely compelling.",1530403200,,360,4.363636363636363
8699491,5,B00SVTE0NA,"i will watch anything that has David James Elliott in it, but this was a surprise, the movie kept me guessing till the end, and still don't know much about Rufus. All of the acting was very good. I had heard about this movie being made, but didn't hear anything about untill now. Why the delay?
Someone else said there needs to be more background info. It would be interesting to see another movie too see what happens later.

DJE did another movie a few years ago that just now been released: Affairs of State. It is a good movie too.",1530230400,,535,4.297029702970297
8699492,4,B00SVTE0NA,This is definitely one of those movies you shouldn't judge by its cover. The only reason I gave it a four instead of a five was because I wanted more from the characters. But the storyline was fantastic and original.,1529712000,,216,4.425
