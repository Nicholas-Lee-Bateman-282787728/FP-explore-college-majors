3692999,5,B001M5UDGS,Joss reunites cast favorites Nathon Fillion and Felicia Day with newcomer Neil Patrick Harris to bring us a fun filled musical about our villian Dr. Horrible (Harris) and his arch-nemisis Captain Hammer (Fillion).  The two duke it out over love interest Penny (Day) in this entertaining three act performance.,1227830400,13,309,5.3061224489795915
3693000,5,B001M5UDGS,"Joss Whedon effectively proved that love of topic and a little help from your friends can make fantastic and addicting entertainment. Dr. Horrible was an overnight sensation when released to video with a great story, amazing characters, and infectious music.

Joss and his cohorts have laboured non-stop to make the DVD worthy of the video it surrounds. Comments from his twitter indicate that there is more music in the commentary than the video itself.

Here's my review: site unseen - extras unknown ---- You bet I'm pre-ordering, day one!

I can hedge my bets it will be worth every penny paid and then 10 times over.",1227830400,27,621,4.839622641509434

3693015,5,B001M5UDGS,"If nothing else draws you in, Joss Whedon did a musical with Neil Patrick Harris, Felicia Day, and Nathan Fillion, should be enough. Just go for it. So much fun. Netflix dropped it a few years ago, and I was not having that, so I bought the movie and the soundtrack.",1516579200,,266,4.235294117647059

3693018,5,B001M5UDGS,"Not many videos are made with this level of complexity these days.  Not only is there subtext in the sub-plot, but they manage to pull off a tragic comedy... or comic tragedy I suppose, depending on your frame of mind.  While technically it is an opera, it plays more like a musical.  Can't imagine someone hating this video!",1515024000,,325,4.568965517241379
3693019,5,B001M5UDGS,"This is a weird movie made by weird people, and it just works. Joss knows what he is doing and it shows all throughout the movie.

Great soundtrack too -- ""Its a brand new day / And the sun is high / All the birds are singing / That you're gonna die"" -- who can beat that? That song's been my earworm all day today. (Or my Brain Bug.) Tragic and funny and singable all at once.",1510876800,,1199,6.940397350993377

3693067,5,B001M5UDGS,"This short movie was something I delightfully happened across a number of years ago.  Halrious musical with numerous Hollywood faces in it.

I beyond loved this.  Like maybe triple love it.  The interesting point is that over the years as I've shared this with friends I have found no middle ground.  Either friends joined me in laughter and joy watching this or they looked at me in puzzlement from the beginning of the movie and never quite clicked with the movie.

You can find the movie for free on YouTube to see where you fit in.  I loved it so much I wanted to own it in blu ray splendor and have gifted it numerous times.

I am a bit puzzled as to why the price has shot up from $5 to approx $15. This is not a full length Hollywood movie.",1498003200,,747,4.211267605633803
3693068,4,B001M5UDGS,"Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog is the all-too-common story of an idealistic young progressive who, in typical fashion, believes he is one of the blessed few people who can identify and fix the ills of society. The young idealist quickly learns as he attempts to enact his ideas that they are not only feckless, but also have inherent consequences. Through these comical trials he eventually commits the ultimate sin of socialism: desiring to achieve a personal goal! When his plans toward his goal fail miserably, he predictably doubles-down on his logically flawed worldview and accepts that socialism must require enforcing from some individual or group that's exempt from ""equality."" He then embraces his new totalitarian communist philosophy a la Che Guevara, etc, by committing acts of violence. As the story closes, our progressive friend reaches the ultimate prize for his ideological religion: total isolation from dissenting points of view AND the ability to force his worldview onto others! The specific venue/group is somewhat unclear, an analogy for the U.N.? Minus 1 star for what looks like a ran-out-of-budget ending, a brief and hazy montage.",1497830400,,1158,5.333333333333333

3693089,5,B001M5UDGS,"What can I say about Dr. Horrible? It's amazing. It's strange and irreverent humor and endearing wit and charm is just...perfect! It's never going to stop being one of my favorites. Here's the plot: we're in a world of super heroes and villains. But discretion is paramount, therefore during the day Dr. Horrible is just...Billy. Billy is in love with Penny. (Felicia Day.) Penny is in love with the idea of saving the world and falls for Captain Hammer (Corporate Tool!) played by the ever so handsome and charming Nathan Fillion. Frozen yogurt and well crafted lyrical puns mixed in with Neil Patrick Harris's adorable and Felicia's wit and Nathan's humor...it doesn't get much better than this. Billy convinces Penny over laundry to be friends with him, but every time he tries to make it something more...Captain Hammer stands in the way.
I don't want to spoil the plot, but it's a GREAT show. It was one of the best things to happen in the big Hollywood Writer's Strike. It's a wonderful ride but be warned it just...ends. I'm very conflicted about the ending, but that being said it's one of my NUMBER ONE movies that people MUST see. I hope that someday Joss Whedon (director) will pick these characters back up again. Wonderful movie with a musical format that works, doesn't annoy and is very funny! I cannot say enough good about Dr. Horrible's Sing-A-Long Blog!",1485561600,2,1372,4.793248945147679

Given the singing wasn't nearly as bad as the rest of it; I was debating between one and two stars ... but the rest was just so awful.  This was worse than ""So I Married an Axe Murderer"" minus the classic memorable lines that one had.
I am so disillusioned and duped by the 4.8 stars from 1196 reviews on Amazon.  What were they thinking.  I think all the Whedon family friends got together, drank too much and gave it 5 star reviews ... about a dozen times each.

3693134,5,B001M5UDGS,"This is an older title and you can thank the writers strike for sparking this brilliant little piece of insanity. You probably already know what this is about.  Just know the music is used simply as a momentum builder for the story and even though this was done on the cheap it has flourishes and qualities that more than make you wish this were an actual TV show, or movie. As such, it plays a lot like a pilot, but would probably work best as a half hour show.  Also, the specials sprung for are substantial and there's a lot of value in this. They keep talking about doing a sequel to this, but due to everyone in this being very successful and busy it probably will never happen unless an investor takes a good look at it and thinks there's a very profitable future in store. It's a musical, so that won't happen and it's also rather dark.",1479513600,,843,4.29559748427673

3693139,5,B001M5UDGS,"I first watched Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog on Netflix.  I'm not really sure why I selected it to watch; maybe it's because I love Neil Patrick Harris in his role as Barney Stinson of How I Met Your Mother...But I watched it, not really knowing what to expect.  AND I LOVED IT!!!  I swear I watched it every single day for a while...That is, until Netflix took it off.  I was so bummed!

For one reason or another, I never bought the actual Blu-ray.  I ended up buying the soundtrack on iTunes, which satiated my love for the movie's music.  However, the soundtrack only contains the actual songs, of course.  While Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog is primarily music, I missed the dialog of Dr. Horrible's daily blogs and his banter with Captain Hammer.

So I finally caved in and bought the Blu-ray.  And I am so glad I did because this movie is AWESOME!  Like I said before, it's primarily a musical.  But even people who don't like musicals will LOVE it!  My husband isn't too fond of musicals; the only one that he actually likes is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Little-Shop-of-Horrors-The-Director-s-Cut-Theatrical-BD-Blu-ray/dp/B008AT71WI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Little Shop of Horrors: The Director's Cut + Theatrical (BD) [Blu-ray</a>].  But he LOVED Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog!!  And he doesn't mind watching it over and over again because the songs are great and it is hilarious!

The storyline is great, the comedy is witty...I even enjoyed watching the behind the scenes included with this Blu-ray.

You really must buy this and watch it.  It is simply amazing!  Now I just have to wait impatiently for Joss Whedon to make a sequel!",1476489600,4,1698,5.199261992619927

However, his arch-enemy, the hero Captain Hammer (Nathan Fillion) stands ever in his way. Worse, Dr. Horrible is smitten by a girl he met in the Laundromat, Penny (Felicia Day), and even here Captain Hammer stands in his way. Can Dr. Horrible win the day...should he?

I must say that I was surprised at how excellent this show really is! The idea of a superhero/supervillain story made in the form of a musical blog is revolutionary. And yet, it really works! Mr. Harris does a great job as Dr. Horrible, and as you watch the story unfold you really have to wonder who the hero is, and who should win. Its really not as clear as you would think.

Now, I was not really thrilled with the ending (no spoilers here!), but nonetheless, it is a great show, and I enjoyed ever minute I spent watching it. If you like superhero stories, then you will like Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog. I just hope, hope, hope that they make a sequel!",1464307200,,1049,4.486910994764398

I love the making of featurettes, abd the filmmakers commentary. The musical commentary was fun, but a bit strange. And it was sometimes hard to tell what the heck they were saying.......plus it's mostly played for laughs rather than serious information. You'll get alot more info from the making of and the Filmmakers commentary. The ELE application videos were fun, except for the one about The Reverend. That was creepy.

3693341,5,B001M5UDGS,"I am a lover of musicals, but even I had my doubts when an old friend told me he was bringing over a musical for us to watch together starring, of all people, Doogie Howser! I'll admit that I don't keep up with Broadway shows and who is starring in what, nor do I watch network television, so I was more than astounded as this short little film unfolded, and Neil Patrick Harris sang things that grew progressively more complex by the minute. His talent is equally matched by that of his co-cast members. Nathan Fillion (if you're a Sci-Fi buff, you may recognize him as the captain of the ship Serenity, from the series Firefly) was just as amazing as NPH was - toward the end of the film he hit a high note out of a dead silence and nailed it perfectly. If you have ever done much vocal work you know this is VERY difficult to do. Felicia Day, while not doing as many vocal ""acrobatics"" as her co-stars, has a sweet, beautiful voice that you could listen to all day. The movie is filled with a many numbers (duets isn't exactly the correct term) where the two or three main character are all singing at once, and it all meshes perfectly. This was written by the creator of FIrefly, Joss Whedon, his two brothers, and Maurissa Tancheroen - Joss and Zack Whedon also wrote all of the music in the show. It was filmed in just 6 days during the 2008 American Writer's Guild Strike, and so as not to break the strike, none of the cast accepted any compensation for their work at the time of filming. It was first broadcast free to view on the internet and has become a cult classic over the years, as well as winning several prestigious awards. If you enjoy talented musicians, quirky dark humor, and are looking for something to fill an hour or so of your time, you absolutely can't go wrong with Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog.

Not a fan of musicals, but I love the songs and the story. Dr. Horrible just wants to be an evil super villain/boyfriend of that cute girl at the laundromat, but cheesy-on-the-outside (and inside) super hero Captain Hammer just can't stay out of it.

  The cast choice was a no brainier for anyone familiar with his work. Neil Patrick Harris showcases his amazing talent both singing and acting as (Swoon) Dr. Horrible. Nathan Fillion, Captain Hammer, is amazing. Its a stretch from ""Mal"" but that is what makes it so good. Felicia Day... just fantastic.

This movie is 2 guys fighting for the attention of one girl Penny, the good guys isn't all good and the bad is not all bad. It's funny,and it's cheesy, your teens might like it.

Call up of some of your family and friends who also happen to be talented writers, musicians, and actors with a sense of humor and make something yourself and call it Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog!!!!! I can not recommend this enough.  What they created was a musical comedy-drama miniseries in three acts, produced exclusively for Internet distribution but of course now on DVD. Filmed and set in Los Angeles, the show tells the story of Dr. Horrible (played by Neil Patrick Harris), an aspiring supervillain; Captain Hammer (Nathan Fillion), his nemesis; and Penny (Felicia Day), their shared love interest. From that start you get one of the best musical superhero/super villain /love interest story ever created!

In this film, he plays Billy who has an alter ego named Dr. Horrible, a scientist who is trying to take over the world and get into the Evil League of Evil which is run by Dark Horse, the Thoroughbred of Sin. He is constantly thwarted by Captain Hammer (Nathan Fillion), a superhero who is more brawn than brain.

Dr. Horrible meets Penny (Felicia Day), a girl whom he likes. He sees her while doing laundry and sings a song about it. It's lovely. He's clearly infatuated with her and falls hard for her. Dr. H gets a letter back from the Evil League of Evil about his admission status. It states he must commit more crimes and maybe a murder or two.

While attempting to commit said crimes, he's interrupted by Captain Hammer who makes Penny swoon over his manliness. Billy must also hide from Penny that his alter ego is terrorizing the people of the city. This continues throughout the movie leading up to the climactic ending. Dr. Horrible with his gadgets and science vs. Captain Hammer with brute strength.

Chances are, if you're reading this, you've already seen the movie and are looking to buy the DVD. Just do it already. It's not very long but it's really funny and the music is amazing.

3693552,5,B001M5UDGS,"Out of the 2007-08 Writer's Guild of America strike came this fantastic standalone short musical film. The Whedon brothers (of Buffy fame, amongst other productions) wanted to create something that would not interfere with the strike. Of course, at the time there were several actors who were on hold due to the strike, so they banded together to produce this fun little project.

Without getting into too far into spoiler territory (don't read this paragraph if you want to go in cold), Dr. Horrible, mad scientist extrodinare, is seeking admission to the Evil League of Evil. He communicates with others via his blog, though some of his readers look upon him with disdain. He happens to be in love with Penny, which causes a problem when they run into his arch nemesis, the incredibly self-centered Captain Hammer. Who's the bad guy, again?

This film was funded on Whedon's own dime. Subsequent DVD sales went to pay the cast and crew, who volunteered their time for this project. I hadn't been a fan of Neil Patrick Harris before this--in fact, I don't know if I've seen anything else he's been in besides some Doogie Howser when I was little--but he's fantastic in this, as is the rest of the cast.

Dr. Horrible's Sing-A-Long Blog

This review has two sections.  In the first section, I will address those who have not yet seen the film and suggest why I recommend it.  In the second, I will address those who have seen it to articulate my opinion of the film.  The second part has spoilers.

I.  Why I recommend this film.  (For those who have not seen it)

This fun, 40 minute musical portrays an evil villain, Dr. Horrible, at his cozy home blogging to his viewers about his efforts to take over the world and his aspirations to join the Evil League of Evil - a well respected ban of evil villains.  He is quite devout in his plans and does not have time to tangle with wannabe super heroes trying to make a name for themselves.  Dr. Horrible's life becomes complicated when the girl of his dreams, who he is too shy to approach, begins to fall for his arch nemesis, Captain Hammer.

The scenario has an absurdity akin to Dexter's Laboratory, with heroes and villains that more or less also have normal lives.  The delightful twist is that the protagonist is the evil villain and the antagonist is the super hero.  On the one hand, they are forces of society to be reckoned with, on the other hand they portray the jock and the nerd who loathes him for always getting the girl.  It has funny dialogue and the songs are enjoyable.  Cheesy, one might say, but in a satirical way that people who love musicals and people who don't love musicals can appreciate.  Finally, it's comically dark ending will slap you in the face - it's the twistedness that wins in the end.

I highly recommend it.

II.  REFLECTION:  (For those who have seen it.  WARNING:  CONTAINS SPOILERS)

""Peace! ...But not literally.""
""It's not a perfect metaphor.""

In this section I seek to explain why I enjoy this film, as I know a few people who find it either uninteresting or unnecessarily tragic.  I will discuss my own interpretations and reflections.

Let me begin by saying that I really like the ending.  It is a satirically delivered comical tragedy.  There are not many films that can pull that off.  The conclusion felt kind of like a slap in the face, and part of that experience was having to confront, perhaps subconsciously at first, the following question:  ""Does Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog have a happy ending?""  On the one hand, No.  It is a tragic ending because Penny dies.  On the other hand, Yes.  Dr. Horrible gets into the the Evil League of Evil.  Besides, shouldn't the villain be happy, feeling satisfying closure, with a tragic ending?  A deeper look reveals a more complicated narrative that is ultimately a tragedy - but a revealing tragedy that is comically delivered where the protagonist's victory is really a shallow one.  Consider the deeper question, ""Did the protagonist, Dr. Horrible, get what he wanted?""  He may say so, but he would not be honest.

I can expound on this by appealing to the film's play on good and evil.  I would suggest we can better understand this play by looking at the film's resonances with Gothic themes.  Some stories depict a kind of epic battle between good and evil, where evil is fixed by restoring a cosmic or moral order.  The Gothic, however, offers a nihilistic and even sadistic perspective.  Evil lurks in familiar places and may even dwell within all people.  Many of us can identify with the Gothic villain, or the monster, which is part of why it's so chilling (think of Mr. Hyde).  In the Gothic, the hubris of optimistic humans can unleash an eruption of dark forces.  Mary Shelly's Frankenstein, Edward Scissorhands, Event Horizon, and even Jurassic Park all share these themes.  The Gothic is disenchanted by social ills and recognizes moral authority and social prestige as facades.

In this narrative paradigm it is easier to sympathize with the evil villain.  ""The world is a mess and I just need to rule it.""  Of course, we know that a key ingredient for evil is good intentions, especially when those good intentions involve ruling the world.  Still, we do sympathize with them....don't we?  (Eh-hem).  We all know that the world is a mess.  We also know that when you stand against a self-righteous society that dominates the discourse about good and evil you will be cast as a villain (aren't people who take a radical political stance against the actions of the state castigated as ""evil""?).

Captain Hammer, whose duty is to protect the present order, is shallow, self centered, and he's never felt pain.  He's emotionally challenged and can only embrace society's ideological optimism.  The good, represented by Captain Hammer, and the evil, represented by Dr. Horrible, in this narrative world are facades.  If we can speak of good and evil, then they transcend these facades.  One might argue that Captain Hammer participates in evil precisely in his pursuit for good.  Also, there is a sense that Dr. Horrible desires evil....for a greater good.  This transcendence of good and evil is manifest in the tragic ending, because the end result is not truly Dr. Horrible's desire.  ""Peace!  ...but not literally.""

The real good character is Penny.  Even if Dr. Horrible lives in a dark world, Penny can say that ""even in the darkness every color can be found.""  Her interests and goals are altruistic and humble, contrasted by Captain Hammer's fan club who are shallow and trendy.  Perhaps the burden that Penny carries for not following trends is her loneliness.  She finds fulfillment in the service of others.  What she does not do is find solace in society's ideological optimism.  Nor does she navigate through her insecurities by constructing an identity as a hero or a villain.  Penny transcends the ideological grid and social constructs of ""good and evil"" that lock the hero and the villain into an ongoing battle.  Her goodness is not a facade.  This is especially realized in her tragic death, the true evil.

The punchline of the film is that Dr. Horrible has won in the end by ultimately losing.  Ultimately his desire to be evil is a mask for his real desire for intimacy and acceptance.  ""Penny will see the real me, not a dork, not a joke, not a failure.""  His desire to be a supervillain is part of a mask to help him fulfill his real desire.  (""Some people are layered like that"").  Ironically, by the destruction of the object of his underlying, masked desire, he has fulfilled the desire that makes up his facade.",1408665600,,6473,4.733632286995515

I only knew that I had met Nathan Fillion and fell in love with him as a person and now wanted to see everything that he has done. But when the music started in this totally random music blog, I was instantly hooked. I cannot believe how beautiful the music is in this production. Neil Patrick Harris has an amazing voice and it is so fun to watch Nathan Fillion belt out pretty cheesy songs (which actually makes him look like a jerk, but he is TOTALLY NOT). :) I highly recommend giving this a chance because it is full of cheese but it has heart and it made me laugh and I have the whole soundtrack on my ipod and I belt out the songs every chance I get! :)",1402617600,,731,3.979591836734694
3693622,3,B001M5UDGS,"I should preface this by saying that I'm not a fan of Joss Whedon. I've watched a few episodes of ""Buffy"" and ""Angel,"" but never got into them. I don't think ""Dr. Horrible"" is in the same vein as those two shows, except for the supernatural elements.

I admire the fact that the show was produced on a shoestring budget, but unlike, for example,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/El-Mariachi/dp/B000OVC2QK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">El Mariachi</a>, this fact wasn't rammed down your throat at every opportunity. The production was as elaborate as it needed to be. And the songs were decent, although not even close to the level of that ""Buffy"" episode where a musical demon takes over the world, and everyone inadvertently breaks out into song; ""Once More, With Feeling."" The problem with ""Dr. Horrible"" is that it's a parody of a genre that hasn't needed to be parodied for a long time, so the whole thing comes off as pointless. It's like meeting someone who is still upset because Calvin Coolidge didn't run for a second term. The role reversal was predictable: the mad scientist who wants to take over the world is really a sweet guy whose shyness with the girl plays on the audience's sympathies, while the superhero is an insufferable jerk who turns out to be a cowardly crybaby. And of course, Joss Whedon can't resist killing off an innocent character. I have to admit, there were a few funny lines, and one of the villains at the end, ""Fake Thomas Jefferson,"" is hilarious. But overall, it just wasn't funny or enjoyable, although the 45 minute length didn't drag out the proceedings unnecessarily.

Yet everyone I know thinks this is a modern cult classic. I am currently involved in a local community theater production of Dr. Horrible. Maybe I'll feel differently about it after participating in the production and seeing it live.

* * * * * * * *

I can now definitely say that ""Dr. Horrible"" is definitely improved by live performance, probably because the theater lends itself to camp more than the movies. Unfortunately, because Whedon is now working on a sequel (*shudder*), outside production rights for ""Dr. Horrible"" are no longer available. The producer of the show I saw was the last one to get the rights, and I saw the final show. And unauthorized presentations are apparently vigorously prosecuted by Mr. Whedon. So no one will be able to see ""Dr. Horrible"" at its best for at least a hundred years or so, when it enters the public domain.",1402444800,,2506,4.945368171021378

3693645,5,B001M5UDGS,"It's no secret that both Joss Whedon and the ensemble cast (featuring NPH, Felicia Day, and Nathan Fillion) come with a strong following. So you're first instinct may be that all the praise this short movie receives is unfounded fanboism; and you're right.. kind of.

It's hard to explain Dr. Horrible without a little background information first. Joss Whedon, along with his friends and family (many of them on the cast or production team), decided to create this short film amidst the turmoil of the writer's strike in 2007. By circumventing the politics and issues around the strike, they were able to focus production on the intended audience as well as their own interests. Whedon's script (and lyrics) features his trademark whit, Neil Patrick Harris shows off his Broadway training, Nathan Fillion acts like the loveable-yet-alpha-jerk that many fans imagine him to be, and Felicia Day breaths legitimacy into what would have been an atypically uninteresting female character for Joss Whedon. Everyone associated with this film, had a chance to be themselves. The end result is a musical tragicomedy short film of lovable actors being lovable characters at a time when those very things were taken away from fans due to the writer's strike. That's how you make a love letter to the fans.

However, defining Dr. Horrible in just those terms is not fair to what it accomplished. Yes, the story is simple and full of self-aware sarcasm. Yes, it's less than 45 minutes. But in that short screen time, Joss Whedon accomplishes what George Lucas failed to do in 3 movies. He spun a character arc the went from lovable character to evil lovable character, AND MADE IT FUN AND EMOTIONAL. I'm picking on George Lucas a bit, but such a narrative is tricky in any medium. The fact that it was done so well in such a restrictive format is impressive. In an age where bigger budgets is the fad, Dr. Horrible shows that with the right actors and production staff, better results can be achieved with just 200k.",1397520000,,2004,4.856725146198831

3693658,5,B001M5UDGS,"To me, this video is more than an amazing video. It is more than an Internet Sensation. It is more than Neil Patrick Harris, Nathan Fillion, and geek queen Felicia Day getting to show off their singing chops as well as their acting ones. It is an overwhelming show of the powerhouse that New Media could become with a little bit of money and real heart and soul put behind it.

The show is, at its heart, a story about an up-and-coming supervillain torn between his lady love and his job. But goes deeper than that. It has very real heart, emotion, and at the risk of taking a Buzzfeed stance on it, the ending will blow you away. Joss Whedon has outdone himself on this labor of love, and I feel that everyone should experience it at least once. Preferably more than once; there are hundreds of small details that one doesn't notice the first time, and it is a video that genuinely rewards multiple viewings.

The DVD itself boasts two commentary tracks: a very real one (and very interesting; the group was obviously having a lot of fun) and 'Commentary: The Musical': an *entire* second script that involves even more original songs than the first video. You get the chance to hear such hits as 'Ten Dollar Solo', 'Ninja Ropes', and my personal favorite, 'I'm Better Than Neil'. Along with application videos from The Evil League Of Evil, done by a number of fans with very real love for the medium.

This video is a must-have for *any* fan of the New Media genre, and of the people who put their heart and soul into it. And I feel that it's a 'should see at least once' for almost everybody else. It's proof that you don't need a billion dollars to make something that looks this good, and has this much heart to it.

Felicia Day is relatively new to me, I had only seen her in The Guild before, but she is quickly becoming a favorite. She has a lovely voice, in addition to being a talented actress.
The biggest surprise was Nathan Fillion's singing. We all know he has a velvety smooth voice normally, but his singing voice is like warm whispers of honey and milk (to quote a Missy Higgins song). He should do musical theater full time.

3693686,5,B001M5UDGS,"During the writers' strike, Joss Whedon had some spare time. Some people relax during their spare time. Joss makes a musical. About super-heroes and super-villians, of course.

This show was released on the web. I downloaded it and loved it. Then it came up on iTunes, so I bought it for my iPad. Then DVD, and now Bluray. Take your pick, but the image quality got better with each version. If you can play Blurays, the Bluray is the best.",1388361600,,439,4.4875

3693688,5,B001M5UDGS,"My friends saw this first and kept hyping it up, as well as singing songs from it, and I just didn't get it.  Not until I finally saw the whole thing, that is.

Joss Whedon has done it again, reminding me of one of my favorite episodes from Buffy ""Once More With Feeling.""  I really really doubt that just anyone can make a show that is both comedy and musical and yet has that dark edge and twist that keeps it from becoming out and out camp.  But ""Dr Horrible"" manages it quite nicely!  And the tunes turn out of be positively addictive...

Dr Horrible is this guy who wants to take over the world (to make it a better place, honestly)...or at the very least prove that he is bad enough to join The Evil League of Evil run by the dreaded Bad Horse.  On the other hand, he is this really painfully shy and a bit geeky guy who can't even get up the courage to ask out the pretty and good-hearted girl, Penny, that he keeps seeing at the laundromat.  His worlds then converge when he is foiled (again) by his nemesis, Capt Hammer (a not terribly smart, but well-muscled hero) and his would-be sweetie starts dating his nemesis.

Will Dr Horrible get the girl?  Will he defeat Capt Hammer?  Will his freeze-ray ever work right?  Which side of him will win out in the end--the wanta-be Bad Guy or the guy who has fallen in love with the girl of his dreams.

This show is honestly about the inner struggle of Dr Horrible and along the way we are given a lot of really really catchy songs that you find yourself humming or singing.  Or, best still, singing along with your friends as you sit down to watch the show again and again.  The laundry room song remains one of my favorites ever!

Really really great...buy it, buy one for you friends, play it at parties.",1387756800,,1759,4.284848484848485
3693689,5,B001M5UDGS,"It was, I think, about three minutes out from the end of Act 1 when I realized my initial skepticism at this premise (and dreadfully-anticipated execution) was so far from unwarranted that I had unknowingly sat in a completely non-judgemental thrall, leaning a tad forward in my seat, steeped in a glassy-eyed lull, with lips slightly parted as if in a slow dawning realization of the genius and magic that produced this piece of irreverant cinema since pretty much the first word of the film.

Simply put: this is a brilliant, succinct, and brilliantly-succinct piece of filmmaking.

Well worth watching, regularly, at intervals.",1387411200,,630,5.106796116504855

I wish I had seen this in its original form, set up to look like a normal blog/vlog (in several installments), instead of seeing it in one viewing as a movie. That one is on me, but it still loses something when you see it as a movie, instead of a blog/vlog. It is still brilliant and worthy of watching, and re-watching.

It had its funny moments, but it felt more like yet another Saturday Night Live skit that started funny, then just went on way too long.  If you like SNL from the 90's, then you'll probably like this (that's the only decade I tried to watch SNL, and hated it, and I haven't seen evidence that it got any better).",1381017600,,465,4.25

3693718,5,B001M5UDGS,"Here's something that in no way should work: a musical superhero comedy focused on a villain protagonist's vlog that actually has elements of a tragedy . It's such an eclectic idea that it shouldn't work nearly as well as it does. Yet, Whedon and the cast pull it off beautifully. The humor is great, offering plenty of laugh out loud moments, but the humor never fully distracts from the great characterization brought into it. Our three protagonists blend well together, each representing a stance of morality and the complexities related to it.
The music is worth noting as well. Though the orchestration isn't the best sounding (one must keep in mind that this is a low budget, self funded project), the end result produces some beautiful musical numbers rivaling some fully funded productions.
The Blu-Ray also contains Commentary: The Musical, a meta musical that makes fun of the performers and the production as a whole, and brings a whole new experience to the film itself.
Overall, this film is great. It's weird, it's odd, but the end result is something that's so great that it leaves you wanting more.",1377302400,,1114,4.8994708994708995
3693719,5,B001M5UDGS,Commenting on the product received (rather than the show): this came in a case that was two-thirds the thickness of a standard case and was the first I have had in this size (might be more common elsewhere... another bluray in the same order (Fifth Element) also came in a two-thirds case).,1377216000,,290,4.596153846153846
3693720,5,B001M5UDGS,"I'm definitely a Joss Whedon geek, and this is my favorite of his--even more so than Buffy! The dialogue is hilarious and the film was shot with lots of small, hidden details added in for greater depth and entertainment if you pay attention. I love the music also and the fact that they used the actors' actual voices. Neil Patrick Harris was perfect for this role, and the web blogs are my favorite part. They shows Dr. Horrible's vulnerability and bring a realness to the film. Bravo",1377043200,,485,4.586206896551724

3693722,5,B001M5UDGS,"The first time I watched it, it wasn't quite what I was expecting.  And I had to adjust to Nathan Fillion being the anti-villain to Neil Patrick Harris's anti-hero.

However, I learned long ago to give everything a second chance, especially when it wasn't what I thought it would be.  LOVE IT!  LOVE IT!  LOVE IT!

This is good on so many levels.  Unfortunately, the lessons to be learned are probably lost on those who need to learn them.  But for pure entertainment:  LOVE IT!  LOVE IT!  LOVE IT!

Neil Patrick Harris, Nathan Fillion, the adorably geeky Felicia Day. Short spots by other actors we've come to love such as Simon Helberg (from The Big Bang Theory). You can't get any better! The songs are quirky and fun and just downright EVIL in how they slip into your brain and stay there for days...or weeks...or months. Everyone should watch this movie. And buy the soundtrack.

He and Harris got together and produced this as an independent film, just for laughs and something to do.  It went viral!

His professional aspirations, however, fall prey to both the interference of his pompous nemesis Captain Hammer and the doctor's attraction to the sweet and pretty girl-humanitarian he meets at the laundromat.  An additional problem is the Dr. Horrible is not really that horrible--and thereby lacks much of the killer instinct that would make him an A-1 bad guy.

3693785,5,B001M5UDGS,"One of the most common complaints about Dr. Horrible-- its seemingly abbreviated running time-- is in my opinion one of its greatest strengths.  This is largely because every scene in the movie needs to be there, with no padding or fluff to invite inconsistencies. Every song in the musical is likewise under three minutes, but the lyrics are more clever than those of many Broadway musicals, if I may say so.  Nearly every line of every song is genius, and immensely fun to sing aloud if you're into that sort of thing.  All the actors look like they're having a really great time, especially Nathan Fillion.  All of them are absolutely perfect in their roles.

Basically it's about an ineffectual wannabe supervillian (Neil Patrick Harris) who's too moral to get ahead, and the idealistic girl he's in love with (Felicia Day) who volunteers with the homeless and doesn't know his secret identity.  Actually she doesn't know his layperson identity either at the beginning, but then he talks to her and a whole lot of stuff happens very fast after that.  It's cute, funny and touching, and I'm not willing to give away any details but if I don't mention the ending to prepare you then you'll probably feel gobsmacked by it.  Tis dramatic.  Good for anybody who knows they like Joss Whedon stuff, or anybody who likes singing or independent movies that are witty in a non-pretentious way.  Besides, it's only 45 minutes of your time, although you might become obsessed with some of the individual songs and wish to watch them over and over again on youtube...",1360713600,,1558,4.779850746268656

3693790,5,B001M5UDGS,"I'm a teacher who hardly ever uses films.  I'm very choosy about what I use, whether it's a document, a piece of literature, or a political cartoon.  When it comes time to teach/reteach plot line and the elements of the short story, in both my honors and regular classes, I use this film.  Why is this the perfect film for both boys and girls?  For both Honors and regular classes?

1.  The Whedons have instant credibility, especially now that The Avengers was so successful with a wide audience (Joss wrote its screenplay, as well as the one for Toy Story).  Students also recognize the cast from shows like Castle, The Big Bang Theory, and How I Met Your Mother, so they're in it.
2.  Omniscient point of view:  Musicals are the perfect genre to teach this point of view.  It also reinforces the truth that film is a form of literature.  Students become aware that a film can be in the first person if there is a voice-over in the first person.  Otherwise, it is third person.  Kurosawa is a great filmmaker for showing more than one character's interpretations of an event, but this uses popular culture icons and the timeless superhero motif to make a musical cool!  It also shows that omniscient doesn't necessarily mean you know EVERY character's thoughts--just the important ones to the conflict.
3.  There are both major and minor conflicts that are easy to identify.  There are three clear conflicts, all three of which Dr. Horrible exposes in the first scene.  Every student benefits from this complex structure AND understands it.  It's not beneath the honors students, and the students in the regular class can follow it and identify it, as well.  They can also see how climax in a plot line can be in the same scene for every conflict, but different parts.  Best line with a double meaning to discuss that addresses two of the conflicts in one:  ""The world I wanted at my feet"".  GENIUS!
4.  Resolution symbolism.  At first, when the film goes dark, students call out, ""It's over?  What?""  Then we have an amazing discussion where it comes out that the simplicity of the ending really exposes Billy's darkness and loneliness and how utterly human and broken and incomplete he is when he's alone.
5.  You can understand every single word in the lyrics.  The enunciation is perfect.
6.  There's love and superheroes.  How perfect is that?
7.  Every song is catchy, and the dialogue is witty.  During class, students react the whole way through.  Some of my students are still singing the songs.  They have also come back to me and told me they've watched it several times since class.  They talk to others about it.  Even after they're my students, they come back to visit me, ask me what we're doing, and ask, ""Have you shown them Dr. Horrible yet?""  It's a hit!
8.  It catches you off guard.  You think it's gonna be funny, and then you're hit with a curve ball.
9.  The end of each act is a perfect discussion place, if you feel like your class needs to discuss and clarify complications.
10.  This has elements of a Greek tragedy, not only because of the three acts, but with our flawed hero whose own ambition is destroying him.
11.  Themes involve the darkness and frivolity of society, false prophets, what a hero truly is.  Powerful depth for a film that seems to be a comedy.
12.  It's short, only 42 minutes long, and yet so much happens.  These men are geniuses!  Thank goodness for that writer's strike where they just got bored sitting around and decided to come up with this gem!

WARNINGS:
1.  There are two sexual references, one involving the word ""penis"".  Students can handle this.  Don't prepare them for it or make a big deal out of it if students giggle.  It's funny.  It even goes to show the shallowness of Dr. Horrible's nemesis, Captain Hammer, and how he hides his true self from everyone by Billy who is in awe at their blindness--the references are not just there because sex sells.  They have a purpose.
2.  If you don't talk to them about what musicals can do as literary genres and point of view, many students will act too macho whenever a character begins to sing.  They will guffaw, turn away, or in some other way act like it's silly.  Just tell them that they are mature, young adults and that you have a Plan B if they can't handle this.  Then after you show them the movie, tell them what you saw that you liked about how they were audience members.

I feel like I can guarantee success with this one.  Let's just say that it would be hard to fail.  Your students will love it, and you will never be accused of trying to get out of teaching for awhile by merely showing a film to your class.",1359849600,7,4642,4.521686746987951

It's not only a lesson is gorilla film making...it also just stands on it's own as a great piece of work.

You can relate to the story, you find yourself singing the songs and you will anxiously await part two.  And you'll laugh so hard in spots that you'll have to stop the DVD so you won't miss anything.  And be sure to watch ""Commentary: The Musical"" and search for all the easter eggs hidden on the disc.

There wasn't anything particularly bad about this, it had its moments for sure, but there's nothing particularly great or groundbreaking either. Like pretty much everything, it's not for everybody, so if you're interested in anything this has to offer do, yourself a favor and try to find clips or the whole thing for free somewhere first before purchase.

The characters were well thought out, I think I actually liked all of them for the most part, but for me the only piece that stood out with the storyline was that it was told through song; an interesting format to be sure.

3693823,5,B001M5UDGS,"Ok, NPH (Neil Patrick Harris) reinvigorated his career after Doogie Howser, by going crazy crude on Harold and Kumar. It's supposedly what brought him back into the fold for shows like How I Met Your Mother.

Dr. Horrible was created during the Writer's Guild of America strike back in '07-08. To me, it shows how versatile NPH is with comedy. He is just so fluidly capable of making us laugh, while bringing empathy for his character. The cast also includes Felicia Day (a regular webisoder), who also was recently in a Supernatural episode as the quirky, hacker lesbian. Not really relevant, but her ""quirkiness"" also comes out in her character here and makes her ""the girl next door"" in this program.

We also can't leave out Nathan Fillion (of Firefly and Castle fame). Downright hilarious as the ""anti-hero"" from the get-go. Always charming, and even more so when being pompous, he is a perfect foil for Dr. Horrible (NPH).

The sing-along blog will definitely make you want to burst out into song on your own along with the gang.

Yes, you could go watch this on YouTube for free. But, you'd miss so much and the special feature interviews are great.

Best part is this project bypassed the BIG movie companies and was given to the public. Quality story telling and entertainment without relying on big-budget effects and a shallow story. Priceless!

3693841,4,B001M5UDGS,"Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog is a 2008 Musical Tragicomedy. The film was written by Joss Whedon and his two brothers Zack Whedon and Jed Whedon and Maurissa Tancharoen. They wrote this tragicomedy during the Writers Guild of America strike in 2007-2008. It was directed by Joss Whedon. The musical tragicomedy is only a 42 minute film, which made it small, inexpensive, but yet professionally done.
  Dr. Horrible Sing-Along Blog is about Dr. Horrible (Neil Patrick Harris) a super-villain who has a PHD in horribleness, who wants to get into the Evil League of Evil, Captain Hammer (Nathan Fillion) Dr. Horrible nemesis who is a superhero and Penny (Felecia Day) who Dr. Horrible is madly head over heels for who is a volunteer for the caring hands homeless shelter.
  The film begins with Dr. Horrible talking on his video blog. He talks about his application to get into the Evil League of Evil and starts to answer some of the e-mails he's gotten. He says ""the world is a mess"" and ""I just need to rule it."" One of the e-mails asks him who is ""her"". He is then interrupted by his friend moist (Simon Helberg) who's powers extend to dampening things. Horrible then receives a letter from black horse (leader of the Evil League of Evil), telling him that his application for entry will be evaluated, and will be watching him for his next heinous crime.
  Dr. Horrible then sets off to steal a case of wounderflonium for his time stopping freeze ray, where he uses a remote device to control the van. Penny who is on the same street as him is trying to get people to sign her petition for turning a condemned building into a homeless shelter. She runs into Horrible asking him to sign his petition, but the remote requires his attention and he acts uninterested in her and her cause. Penny leaves, Dr. Horrible is conflicted, but ends up stealing the wounderfionium telling himself ""a man's got to do what a man's got to do.""
  While trying to control the remote control device, Captain Hammer shows up stopping him once again from doing evil. Captain Hammer and Penny meet and they start dating, which then really makes Dr. Horrible want to really dive deep down to his evil temptations.
  The one thing that Dr. Horrible makes a mistake of doing is his video blog where he tends to share his evil plans. The first plan he had to get him into the Evil League of Evil got ruined, because Captain Hammer and the police watched his blog and was waiting for him.
  As the film comes to an end Dr. Horrible finally has Captain Hammer right where he wants him, Horrible ends up freezing Captain Hammer with his freeze ray. Dr. Horrible soon to be victory ends up back firing, the freeze rays battery ends up dying. Horrible notices it and he says ""that's not a good sound."" Captain Hammer then breaks free and hits Dr. Horrible. Hammer then grabs Horrible death ray gun, but it ends up back firing throwing Hammer across the room. Penny ends up taking objects to the chest and dies.
  Dr. Horrible then ends up getting pinned for Penny's death, which changes everything for him. Captain Hammer is now devastated by the loss of his fight with Dr. Horrible not the loss of his girlfriend, and Dr. Horrible gets into the Evil League of Evil.
  This short 42 minute internet musical tragicomedy film was very entertaining. Not only is it entertaining but also a romantic love comedy, along with a super-villain superhero comedy.

3693844,4,B001M5UDGS,"Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog has an interesting story line that can be enjoyed by all people.  Don't let the title scare you off, it might not seem the most entertaining but you'll be in for a treat.  The movie has many different aspects to it that make it very entertaining.  There are also a few elements that could be broken down in this film; they would be colors, the characters, and the setting.  Pathos was also a big element of this film that can't be ignored.  The film Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog can be enjoyed by all ages because of its interesting storyline and appealing characters.
The setting for this movie revolves around the main character, Dr. Horrible.  He is either filming a blog for his views, acting as an evil villain, or doing his laundry with Penny.  Penny is a woman that Dr. Horrible has a huge crush on but doesn't know how to talk to her.  The catchy tunes that they sing throughout the movie will get stuck in your head but you won't mind, they are very enjoyable.  There is also another interesting character, Captain Hammer.  He takes the place of a hero since Dr. Horrible is presumably the villain even though you don't view him that way.  You probably won't view Captain Hammer has the hero but as a villain.  This is because of pathos, the appeal using emotion.  The audience is more emotionally attached to Dr. Horrible than Captain Hammer because Hammer can be seen as a woman stealer since he took Penny away from Dr. Horrible.
Colors are also an interesting aspect in this film.  Dr. Horrible wears a white lab coat for most of the movie while Captain Hammer wears predominately black clothing.  White signifies the innocence of Dr. Horrible and the black expresses the evil in which Hammer possesses.  Then after something catastrophic and unpredictable happens Horrible wears a red lab coat instead of the white one.  Red is the color that expresses love and passion so I believe he's wearing a red coat to show he lost something that he loved.
Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog will take you on an eventful ride and captivate you from the very beginning.  It has romance, comedy, and action which will peak the interest of any viewer.  This film also won't disappoint if you enjoy watching the characters use different technology throughout the film.  It establishes pathos which will appeal to your emotions more and more as you get further into the movie.  The storyline and setting are very interesting along with the characters and very good acting.  I'd recommend this film to anyone who is looking for a good laugh, a romance, or an action packed movie.",1352937600,,2607,4.708609271523179
3693845,4,B001M5UDGS,"Joss Whedon's Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog challenges the traditional views of good versus evil. The movie includes fine acting, catchy, well- written songs, and a witty yet humorous dialogue that makes it enjoyable to watch. It consists of a thought out exchange of ideas with sarcasm and incorporates a secret romance that helps maintain a certain charm throughout the film.

Dr. Horrible is an assumed evil villain caught up in world domination. He brags about his adventures through his Internet blog and hopes to win admission into the Evil League of Evil. He plans to steal materials needed for his secret weapon and attempt to kill his archenemy, Captain Hammer. Inside however, Dr. Horrible is a sweet romantic who has fallen in love with an innocent, nave girl named Penny. Captain Hammer, on the other hand, is a self-centered human being who uses his hero title to get women.

Dr. Horrible is aware the League observes his every move, so he performs to his most wicked ability. He tries to steal the wonderflonium needed for his freeze ray, but looses control of the van. Right as the van is about to collide with Penny, Captain Hammer appears and pushes her out of the way. As a result, Dr. Horrible introduces his most hated foe to his dream girl.

The ""evil"" Dr. Horrible's apparel includes an all white coat and gloves. The color white tends to symbolize innocence and righteousness. Conversely, the ""hero"" Captain Hammer's attire consists of dark colored clothes, which typical are worn by the immoral and guilty. Half way through the film, Penny has a conversation with Billy. She comments on Captain Hammer's demeanor by saying, ""Some people are layered like that. There's something totally different underneath that's what on the surface."" Penny's statement ironically describes Billy too because he is a complex character who appears pleasant towards Penny, but is destructive on the inside.

As the movie reaches its closing stages, Penny gets stabbed with flying shards of metal thanks to Captain Hammer's egocentric doing. As Penny takes her last breath, she says to Dr. Horrible, ""Captain Hammer will save us."" Her dying words are important because Captain Hammer was the one who actually killed her. At the end, Dr. Horrible's true nature is revealed when he joins the Evil League of Evil. He transforms from his white ensemble into a dark, red suit and black gloves. This change signifies his transformation from good to evil. Dr. Horrible ultimately achieves his goal of supreme power, but does not get the girl of his dreams. The quality of acting in this short movie is rather good compared to other movies that have this specific genre and disposition. The fusion of quirky humor, irony, and memorable songs make this movie worth while to watch numerous times.",1352937600,,2792,4.972162740899358
3693846,4,B001M5UDGS,"Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog, based on originality, creativity, and most of all irony came together to create a very innovated musical. Creating each character to portray such specific traits formed a unique take of the whole musical. Throughout the full 42 minutes, the attention grabbing events and ironic themes produced overall a musical that can be anticipated to be watched over again and again.
 The characters present in this musical all played an extremely important role with regards to personality traits that developed great chemistry. In the beginning, Dr. Horrible is exposed as an evil scientist, with his main purpose to join the Evil League of Evil. Yet, we see his transformation when he begins falling for an innocent young woman, Penny. This struggle between good and evil is convincingly shown throughout the entirety of this musical. Another character, Captain Hammer brings in a bit of humor and is quite different from most heroes. His personality is far from being humble, and his lack of care for anyone but his self is evident several times. The battle between Captain Hammer and Dr. Horrible is originally because one is a hero and the other is a villain, yet their dislike for one another only increases after Penny was brought into the story. The creative mix of relationships created an exciting and suspenseful film.
 The use of irony between the characters and also even in the plot gave this a unique twist unlike most movies. In comparison to the majority of heroes played in films, Captain Hammer was portrayed in a non-heroic light. In a way, he was ""good"", and did ""save"" Penny from danger, but his motives were completely for himself.. In the same way, Dr. Horrible was shown as the villain, and although he was plotting evil schemes, his true nature was kind and considerate. This switch in character traits gave a different take of traditional hero and villain films.
 Another dramatic twist was the death of Penny.  Not only was Penny shot by Captain Hammer but she passed away because of it. This was a great example of the unexpected nature of this film. Penny, the love of Dr. Horrible's life was killed by his number one enemy, on accident. The irony that Dr. Horrible tried to get everything he wanted by killing Captain Hammer, but ended up losing everything when he lost Penny teaches a lesson that can be applied to anything.
 The catchy songs, use of humor, and unexpected ending created an enjoyable musical not like most films. The use of characters to manipulate each other caused another unique aspect that is hard to find. After you watch this once, Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog will most defiantly be on your mind.",1352937600,,2675,4.883259911894273
3693847,3,B001M5UDGS,"Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog is a short film that portrays the story of a young villain, Dr. Horrible, who is aspiring to be a part of the Evil League of Evil. The story uses song and dialogue to illustrate Dr. Horrible's adventures in the life of a villain. For someone like me who has never heard of Joss Whedon, the film seemed quite strange, but yet still enjoyable. Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog is a 45 minute work of art with twists and turns that will keep audiences of all ages entertained.
Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog begins with Dr. Horrible's road to success as an evil mastermind. The two blocking figures that stand in his way are his arch nemesis, Captain Hammer, and the love of his life, Penny. He wants nothing more than to defeat Captain Hammer and take his rightful place in the Evil League of Evil, but Penny stands for everything opposite his dreams. She is the perfect model of the classic ""good girl."" She wants nothing more than to save the world that Dr. Horrible wants to rule. Unfortunately for Dr. Horrible, Penny chooses to break his heart and be with his arch nemesis, Captain Hammer.
Dr. Horrible's plan to rule the world and earn his acceptance to the Evil League of Evil headed into a direction that he never expected. For the first time, his weapon of choice, a freeze ray, actually worked. His wishes to use it to end Captain Hammer, however, did not work out the way that he had planned. Dr. Horrible ended up hurting the only one he loved instead of the only one he hated.
In this film, the classic rivalry between good and evil is constantly in play. Dr. Horrible is considered the evil villain whose nemesis, Captain Hammer, is the typical example of the super hero. The conflict between good and evil can be overdone and clich&eacute;, but when done right, is still enjoyable for any viewer. Dr. Horrible is your average ""bad guy"" who doesn't see the error of his ways until the very end of the movie. Dr. Horrible wants to be the good guy for Penny and also, an evil genius, but realizes all too soon that he can't be both. He decides that he wants to pursue his career instead of his love life, which proves to be an enormous mistake.
Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog is cleverly written and beautifully represented by the cast. Neil Patrick Harris does an excellent job with his character, Dr. Horrible. His acting and singing were thoroughly entertaining. Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog is an Emmy Award-winning, cultural masterpiece. The twists and turns in the plot are enough to entice audiences of all ages. I highly recommend this movie to any audience looking for an interesting and humorous story.",1352937600,,2653,4.670940170940171
3693848,4,B001M5UDGS,"Dr. Horrible's Evil Quest
 Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog was an innovative take of the traditional good vs. evil movie. This movie was written and produced by Joss Whedon. Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog is a low budget film so the effects are not outstanding, but there are many other aspects that more than makes up for anything that the movie may be lacking. My first take on the movie was that it was corny but as I watched I found myself hardly able to contain my laughter. There were a lot of subtle connotations in the movie which I enjoyed interrupting. Neil Patrick Harris plays Billy also known as Dr. Horrible who is a wannabe villain that has a need to be esteemed by Penny and Bad Horse.  Penny is played by Felicia Day; she has captured Billy's heart. Billy and Penny use the same laundry mat.  Billy has been infatuated with Penny for what seems like a long time.  Bad Horse is considered the ""thoroughbred of sin"" and is the leader of the evil league of evil. On the quest to enter in to the evil league of evil Dr. Horrible has to make choices between Penny or his evil plans. Through his evil plans we meet Captain Hammer who is considered Dr. Horrible's nemesis. Captain Hammer is the hero for the city, with that said he is very arrogant. During one of Dr. Horrible's evil plans Captain Hammer saves penny. By saving Penny Captain Hammer then wins her affections. So there is an interesting love triangle that in tangles it's self in the movie. Dr. Horrible's evil plans don't always turn out the way he expects them to, but he desperately wants to be associated with the evil league of evil. I enjoyed the musical feature of the movie as well. The songs were meaningful and had comic flares to them. The actors did an awesome job with the vocals .The movie is simply a terrific story that is unusual, but funny with the elements of love and passion. I disliked the ending at first but I did like what it stood for. You can interpret it in many different ways but I took it to mean every path has its puddle and what we want can come with a great price.",1352937600,,2073,4.376623376623376
3693849,4,B001M5UDGS,"In ""Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog,"" directed by Joss Whedon, Dr. Horrible is a villain who wants to be a part of the League of Evil, led by Bad Horse. Bad Horse puts Dr. Horrible to the test to see if he can make it into the Evil League, by telling him that he has to plan something evil and the League will be watching. The only things standing in Dr. Horrible's way are his arch nemesis Captain Hammer and his love interest Penny.
 Dr. Horrible tries so hard to be a villain, but from the first scene with Penny, viewers see that Dr. Horrible does have a lot of good in him. Dr. Horrible comes off as innocent while attempting to talk to his crush, Penny, at the laundry mat. Most evil villains do not come off as innocent no matter who they are speaking to. From the first scene with Captain Hammer, viewers see that, even though he is supposed to be the hero, that he is not true of heart. Captain Hammer is cocky and does what is necessary to make himself look good. In the first ""heroic"" scene from Captain Hammer, he breaks Dr. Horrible's controls on a van, making it drive with no one directing it, and even though Dr. Horrible is the one who stops the van from driving and killing Penny, Captain Hammer claims to have stopped the van and saved the day. Captain Hammer shows another non-heroic side of him when he tells Dr. Horrible that he is going to sleep with Penny, just because he knows that Dr. Horrible wants her.
 In the end, Dr. Horrible plans to kill Captain Hammer with his death ray to get into the League of Evil. Like always, Dr. Horrible's plans go awry with a very shocking and unexpected ending. This change of events made it possible for Dr. Horrible to get into the League of Evil, but at an awful cost. The final series of events also changed Dr. Horrible to become truly evil.
 Personally, I found this film entertaining. It was filled with witty and extremely corny humor. The film was filled with amazing actors who did an excellent job. I would recommend this movie to any of my friends or family members who wanted to get a good laugh out of a short film.",1352851200,,2090,4.340153452685422
3693850,2,B001M5UDGS,"Joss Whedon's work, Dr. Horrible's Sing-A-Long Blog, is a short movie about a villain fighting to be part of the Evil League of Evil. Along his path of acceptance, he encounters problems with his nemesis Captain Hammer and love interest Penny. Whedon uses immature humor and quite a predictable plot to test of traditional views of good and evil.
Within the first few minutes of Dr. Horrible's Sing-A-Long Blog, I wished it was over already. The immature hero and villain concept and cheesy dialogue automatically made me skeptical of this short film. Within the first few minutes Dr. Horrible breaks out into song about his love interest Penny and it already made me want to turn off the film because of the ridiculous dialogue. In one part, Dr. Horrible ""accidently"" has two frozen yogurts at the laundry mat when Penny comes, but is yet again shot down when Penny begins to talk about Captain Hammer. Many parts of the film include immature and witty humor, only entertaining for the right viewers.
The beginning of the end for Dr. Horrible was when Bad Horse, the director of the Evil League, gives Dr. Horrible an evaluation. When Dr. Horrible loses his opportunity to make a move on Penny, no shock here, Captain Hammer swings in on Penny and saves her. And of course, Dr. Horrible's love interest and nemesis start to date. Captain Hammer's character is extremely arrogant and obnoxious, which only made me more irritated. Also when Captain Hammer is honored with a statue, Dr. Horrible is hiding underneath the curtain to hide the statue, simply the only place where you would predict he would be. These are just a few examples of the extremely predictable plot this film has to offer.
The acting from Dr. Horrible, Captain Hammer, and Penny was not what I was expecting either. I am not a fan of Neil Patrick Harris in many of his roles, but this role especially turned me off to him. I am not familiar with the actor of Captain Hammer or actress of Penny, but both were not good and turned me off to them, too.
The short film challenges the traditional views on good and evil, and heroes and villains. The ending of the film is one you would not expect from the beginning but it only increased my dislike. Whedon does a great job appealing to the viewers who enjoy this witty humor and simply silly sing-a-long genre, but you must be one of these viewers to enjoy this film at all.",1352851200,,2391,4.6415094339622645
3693851,4,B001M5UDGS,"The movie Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog is a 42 minute film directed by Joss Whedon and starring Neil Patrick Harris, Nathan Fillion and Felicia Day. The movie represents the battle of good and evil. However, in this case it is not the expected hero Captain Hammer (Nathan Fillion) who is the good guy but the unexpected Dr. Horrible (Neil Patrick Harris). In the beginning of the short film the ""evil"" Dr. Horrible is wearing white, representative of purity or innocence. While Captain Hammer wears black, which typically represents darkness or evil.  As the movie progresses Dr. Horrible demonstrates several times that he is not horrible. He states in response to a letter about meeting in a park to fight, ""There are children there. And elderly."" Also, he shows he has love for a beautiful gentle woman Penny, played by Felicia Day.
 Captain Hammer demonstrates that he is not the ""good guy"" in several ways also. When Captain Hammer first appears on screen he is saving the day by destroying the controls Dr. Horrible has on a van. But quickly you realize that Captain Hammer is not concerned that this van is driving by itself on the street but more with a pretty lady. Then takes the credit as the ""Hero"" for saving Penny even though it was Dr. Horrible. On his date with Penny at the homeless shelter he appears disgusted with his surroundings.  Again in the park he is appalled that the animals are near him. And lastly, he talks to Dr. Horrible in the laundry mat that he is going to sleep with Penny for the only reason that Dr. Horrible wants her and says, ""Because I get what you want.""
 In the end Dr. Horrible is to kill Captain Hammer with a death ray. His plans are foiled again and Penny ends up dying. However, Dr. Horrible now achieves his goal of being evil enough for the League of Evil, this is a shallow victory. At the loss of his love he becomes truly evil. Dr. Horrible's clothes have gone from white to red, which represents anger, temper or hightened emotions. He appears sad and angry in the end.
 The cinematography was excellent in this film. I actively looked for the camera man in the reflection of the dryers opening in a scene in the laundry mat and was unable to see them.  My wife, a huge Buffy and Angel fan, watched the video at my request and at the end when she saw the credits, said  she could tell it was a Joss Whedon production and even thought one of the songs sounded similar to a song on the musical episode of  Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I would recommend this funny, corny video with excellent acting and singing to any Buffy fan or anyone who wants a quick laugh.

3693852,4,B001M5UDGS,"Plot
While trying to take over the world, Dr Horrible (Neil Patrick Harris) finds out that not everything goes according to plain. He believes that if he can find a way to fulfill his dreams of gaining access to the Evil League of Evil and finding a way to win the attention of his secret crush, Penny (Felicia Day), that maybe people will take him more serious as a Super Villain. However, his nemesis, Captain Hammer (Nathan Fillion) keeps spoiling his brilliant ideas and making him foolish.
Throughout the whole film, Dr. Horrible uses his Internet blog as a way to boast about his super brilliant evil ideas. When reading mail sent in by his viewers, he is asked about whom he is referring to when he says ""she"". This causes the story to switch back and forth between action adventures and a computer set-up, which appears to be in Dr. Horrible's garage, along with his numerous collections of villainous guns and inventions.
During these action adventures and Internet blogs, Dr Horrible and Captain Hammer, compete for Penny's affections. As we watch more of the film we begin to see the differences between the two and their attempts to win over Penny. Doctor Horrible appears to be more of a nice guy than an evil one, while Captain Hammer comes off as conceded and arrogant, making him a poor excuse of a hero. As the film comes to an end, the two face off in a duel for power and the affection of Penny,  which ends badly for one of the two.

Reaction

As I sat in class, watching Doctor Horrible's Sing Along Blog, I couldn't help but enjoy myself. While I didn't really find myself rolling on the floor laughing, I found the whole thing fun and entertaining to watch.
I thought Neil Patrick Harris' singing was outstanding, as well as that of all of the actors in the movie. Each person played his or her role perfectly; with Neil Patrick Harris playing the love stricken Villain, Nathan Fillion playing the conceded, poor excuse for a Super hero, and Felicia Day playing the secret lover fought over by both characters.
The film does have some sexual references as well as mild swearing, however, it is a great watch for the whole family. I believe that after watching the film, it should be given a rating of four and a half stars out of five.",1352851200,,2258,4.57037037037037
3693853,2,B001M5UDGS,"Joss Whedon's 43 minute long movie, ""Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog"", was not one of my favorites and I am not so sure that I would consider watching it again. The short film was a musical, comedy, drama, and tragedy combination which starred Neil Patrick Harris, Nathan Fillion, and Felicia Day. The actors portrayed the parts of good and evil, although you may be shocked to find which is good and which is evil by the end of the movie. Joss Whedon's production was too immature, the music was corny, the acting was awful, and the ending was not all that great.

Joss Whedon's film, ""Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog"", was way too juvenile for older viewers. If you are like me, you will find the good and evil part of the film to be immature and something a twelve year old boy might enjoy. Although I am personally not a fan of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", you might find this film to be good if you enjoy the ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" series. The television series and short film are similar to some of the episodes in the series.

Another aspect of this short film that I am not a fan of is the music. The music seemed to me like it was out of place and ultimately corny. The choice of music reminded me of a pre-teen Disney channel movie. Although I have to admit I am not a fan of musicals, this movie might be your type if you enjoy singing along with your movie.

The third thing that I did not care for in ""Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog"" was the acting. I am a fan of Neil Patrick Harris but I thought his role as Dr. Horrible was not one of his best. Captain Hammers' role obnoxious and Penny was the best actor in the short film.

My fourth and final problem I had with the short film was the ending. The ending was shocking and unexpected, and not what most viewers would want to happen. Captain Hammer begins to date Penny, but will Dr. Horrible get her back and seek revenge on Captain Hammer?

The 43 minute long movie, ""Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog"", is a movie you will either love or hate. It all depends what type of movies you like to watch. If you enjoy a musical, comedy, drama, and tragedy combination than this short film is definitely for you.",1352678400,,2171,4.3638613861386135

The plot centers on an inspiring supervillain named Billy (AKA Dr. Horrible - played by Neil Patrick Harris) who has been invited to join the Bad Horse's Evil League of Evil, but he must do something evil to get in. He plans on finishing his freezing gun, but first he needs to steel some wonderflonium.

While attempting to steal the wonderflonium, his archenemy Captain Hammer (played by Nathan Fillion) interferes, but even worse Captain Hammer makes a move on the girl, Penny (Felicia Day), that he has a crush on.

As Penny begins a relationship with Captain Hammer, Billy comes up with a plan to get into the Bad Horse's Evil League of Evil.

3693881,5,B001M5UDGS,"Great movie for those of you with awry, er, a wry sense of humor. If you are the kind of person who likes the jokes that everyone else is laughing at and don't get it when there there are only a few people laughing then you might be one of the people rating this one star. If only there were more of it, but I guess short and sweet will have to be sufficient for this web-blog madcap venture.
The blu-ray commentary is worthwhile for fans to purchase the disc. I'm pretty sure that's the first commentary I've listened to in song form. No wonder I find regular movie commentaries so boring, if only those shows had the foresight to do what these people have done. I wish there had been video with the commentary, that would have been worth seeing as well, and commentary subtitles, but those are not something people would expect or miss.

3693892,5,B001M5UDGS,"For fans of Joss Whedon's ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", particularly the musical episode, the Emmy Award-winning ""Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog"" is the best thing ever. Joss Whedon and friends made this funny and touching musical, with great music and characters. Neil Patrick Harris is the best I've ever seen him in the title role of Dr. Horrible, and Nathan Fillion (from ""Firefly"") is also grand. The DVD and blu-ray have a lot of nice extras, including a singing commentary track, with all new songs. The music in the commentary songs is okay, but the lyrics and jokes are great. The DVD and blu-ray also have making of featurettes, and three extremely well hidden Easter eggs (I recommend just looking them up on the web). Again, for Joss Whedon fans, ""Dr. Horrible"" is as good as it gets. I liked it more and more with repeated viewings as well. For Buffy fans to not watch this would be like ""Star Wars"" fans not watching ""The Empire Strikes Back"". Reviewed 3/7/2009 after watching at least fifty times on hulu, watching the DVD, the blu-ray, all the DVD extras and Easter eggs, and listening to the CD soundtrack (also available at amazon).

Nathan Fillion is one of the most amazing actors EVER, in my opinion. His usual charm is played into the perfect 'corporate tool'. A good guy who is just so cheesy. I love him. NPH is incredibly awesome and just loveable enough to be the bad-guy you want to root for. And Felicia Day is super cute! The songs are great and I dare you to not get them stuck in your head.

I've loved this show from the first time I watched it (back when it came in 3 parts) and this doesn't make me love it any less. The extra features make this a must buy for any Dr Horrible fan.

One of the most interesting ideas was inversion of the ""evil"" Dr. Horrible, who is principally a quiet, nice guy and the obnoxious ""Hero"" Hammer.

It is quite a scathing view of our hypocritical apprach to everyday life.

The music is also very nice. Really catchy tunes, that invite you, as the title of the video correctly implies, to sing-along.

The additional material is also interesting.

After seeing it online, I was pleasantly surprised to see the High definition Blue-ray version.

Definitely a worthy buy, which I will view quite often. I don't seem to get tired of it.",1321660800,,674,4.817391304347826

It had rave reviews all over the internet, so I was expecting something very entertaining.  What I got instead was a quick, low-budget, badly written musical with the production quality of a YouTube video.  I was very disappointed with the film itself.  One nice bonus though is the commentary that is done completely in song.  I hate to recommend against this product, but it just isn't worth the time.",1314835200,3,613,4.8

Neil Patrick Harris shines as Dr. Horrible.  Funny, clever, poignant at times, and the music is shockingly brilliant.  One song even sounded like it could have been in Rent, the Pulitzer prize winning Broadway musical.  Weird ending but I'm glad it didn't fall into lame cheesiness.

Aside: I watched Megamind not too long ago and I wonder if the creators of that movie took any inspiration from Dr. Horrible.  The ""villain"" and the ""superhero"" are strikingly similar in both movies.",1311984000,,650,4.608695652173913

3693917,5,B001M5UDGS,"I personally don't own the blu-ray - yet - but there really is need to own the disc to review it. Dr. Horrible is nothing short of the best film production to come out of 2008, if not one of the best modern musicals ever. Not only does Joss Whedon's Dr. Horrible prove that the internet and independent film-makers can succeed in a bigger way than ever expected, without the big-league companies supporting them, but it did so in a way that I personally feel should make those same companies fear for their future. Of course, the success of Dr. Horrible isn't random - Joss Whedon is one of the most talented directors in the business. His family as well as Neil Patrick Harris, who is honestly a terrific actor and has a surprisingly infectious voice, in addition to Nathan Fillion, a fan favorite, and Felicia Day who is already a popular internet star, all came together to make this production bleed with quality.

The story itself is excellent and deeper than you would expect for a 42 minute musical - where the eponymous villain actually turns out to be not only the protagonist, but also the hero and the most loveable character in the whole production. Unfortunately I couldn't say more without giving it away - some people may not have seen it.

The blu-ray also contains more special features than you will be able to find on the internet, so it's definitely worth the money. Overall, this is a brilliant musical, referred to as a tragi-comedy (you'll see why), it is laugh out loud funny, and for an independent production, it is about as high quality as they come (despite some saying that their independent budget was noticeable). If you are someone who likes comedy, good music, musicals, Joss Whedon, NPH, or Nathan Fillion, or Felicia Day, there is no excuse for you not to buy this blu-ray. Even if you don't own a blu-ray player or a PS3, you still need to buy this.",1311206400,,1885,4.5905044510385755
3693918,5,B001M5UDGS,"I had no idea what I was getting into with this movie.  I rented it from the library because the title sounded so absurd.  So I wasn't expecting much.  Watching it, I was pleasantly surprised to find a sweet, funny, sad movie...with cool songs!  (After watching this movie, I walked around all day singing, ""With my freeze ray I will stop the world...""

The film is a fun look inside the mind of a super-villain who wants to join a society of bad guys.  But to do it, he needs to perform a worthy feat of evil.  He is distracted from his goal by his crush on Penny, the pretty young woman he sees at the laundromat.  Also standing in his way is his nemesis, Captain Hammer, played wonderfully by Nathan Fillion.  As his criminal enterprises are thwarted, and it looks like Captain Hammer is going to end up with the girl of his dreams, Doctor Horrible decides it's time to up his game....

There is a lot that is good about this film.  Most notable is Neil Patrick Harris, who is the most loveable villain I have seen in a long time.  He handles both the humor and sadness of the film really well...and sings great!  The movie is genuinely funny (I laughed out loud throughout), and the songs are really catching, even if the lyrics will get you some strange looks if you try to sing them in public.

There are a couple flaws with the production.  I did not realize that this was produced for release on the internet.  It looks pretty low-budget, but somehow that doesn't get in the way.  My biggest gripe with the movie is how short it was.  It's only about 40 minutes long, which caught me a little off-guard.  I was hoping it would last a little longer.  But it tells it's story well in the time it has, and it could not have ended more perfectly, so I was content with it.

This is a great film (and now my second favorite Musical, after Labyrinth).  It turns the familiar comic-book character roles upside-down, presenting a world where the villain is a loveable guy outside of his costume, and the hero is a real jerk.  The ending was completely unexpected and absolutely perfect.  Neil Patrick Harris totally nails the last few minutes of the movie.

Final Grade: A-

Also, for those who liked this movie, I would recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Soon-I-Will-be-Invincible-Vintage/dp/0307279863/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Soon I Will be Invincible (Vintage)</a>, a fun book with a super-villain as the main character.  It is very much in the same vein as Doctor Horrible, funny and charming, and another look into the mind of that kind of character.  If you liked this movie, I think you would enjoy reading about Doctor Impossible and his attempt to defeat his arch-nemesis, get the girl, and take over the world.",1310428800,,2773,4.7447698744769875

3693920,4,B001M5UDGS,"""Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog"" is a short, highly entertaining send up of superhero films.  Neil Patrick Harris stars as Dr. Horrible, an archvillain wannabe, trying to be admitted to the League of Evil (headed by the notorious Bad Horse).  To do so he must demonstrate his worth by committing some heinous crime.

Unfortunately Dr. Horrible is (1) incredibly inept and (2) in love with Penny, a young woman he met at a laundromat.  Penny gets tangled up in his schemes, requiring him to save her, canceling the points he earns for his evil deeds.  To make matters worse, Dr. Horrible's muscle-bound, egotistical archnemesis, Capt. Hammer, also has taken a shine to Penny.

The action is punctuated by moments in which Dr. Horrible, Penny, Capt. Hammer and Bad Horse's ch3ering sections burst out in dreadful songs.

Harris is terrific as the pathetic villain.  The musical moments are priceless.  The script is witty, although on occasion it seems to get caught up in its own cleverness. The ending is rather weak.  But all in all, a very enjoyable way to spend 45 minutes.",1310256000,,1076,4.895027624309392

It is unfortunate that his most recent tv ventures--Firefly and Dollhouse--were cancelled so quickly; because of the short time given to them on the air, we were not allowed to see how the story arcs would have developed (as had the longer running Buffy and Angel shows). Dr. Horrible, which I only just recently was exposed to (my internet awareness is, admittedly, limited), once again displays the witty and wild sides of Mr. Whedon. And, most importantly, it also displays his depth of understanding of the human psyche--as the story's protagonist is faced with the ultimate consequences of his choices.

The lyrics are hilarious through and through, and in a delicious twist, Dr. Horrible's nemesis Captain Hammer is the most odious superhero ever put on screen.

But wait, there's more! This DVD edition comes with Commentary: The Musical!, which is an opportunity to add ridiculous meta songs to the original video.

If you've enjoyed Firefly, Buffy, or anything else Whedon has done, or if you like musical comedy, or if you're entertained by egomaniacs, you should buy this.",1300752000,,631,5.176470588235294

It took 8 years for me to be convinced to watch ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" just because I thought that the title was so silly.  But I loved it.  I was still the skeptic when I saw the title ""Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog,"" and that it was an Internet only musical.  I thought to myself, ""Joss has gone over the edge.""  So, I watched it on Hulu and was a bit put off by the first three and a half minutes and after that, quickly fell in love with it.  I can't get the music out of my head and the Commentary Musical is almost as entertaining.  It was an emotional roller-coaster ride.  I'll bet that if you rent it or go to Netflix and stream it, you'll buy the DVD.  If you don't love it, give my comment a low rating and a venom-filled reply.

3693945,4,B001M5UDGS,"Almost three years ago, brothers Zack and Joss Whedon decided to make a musical web series during the writers' strike. What they produced was this phenomenal cult sensation in which Neil Patrick Harris plays a good-hearted bad guy who desperately wants to become a super villain in order to get his crush's attention. His efforts are thwarted when Captain Hammer makes an appearance.

What I found most brilliant is that this grassroots web series it superior in almost every way to hundreds of fully funded network shows. The songs are too catchy for the viewer's own good, the singing is great, and the acting is nearly flawless. Additionally, the Whedon's have perfected the formula for tragicomedies.

It is also astounding that in less than 6 months the web series made back its costs of production. Now that the whole series is on DVD, it is certain to make an even bigger bang! The DVD even has a musical commentary (the songs from the original series and the commentary are available on iTunes).

Neil Patrick Harris is a brilliantly convincing evil scientist/loser ala Phineas and Ferb's Dr. Doofensmirtz with a better singing voice.  Nathan Fillion makes a brilliantly self-absorbed hero.  Not every joke is a winner, but the thing is funny.  And I've purchased the soundtrack and listened to it nonstop for days.  The lyrics may be a little on-the-nose, but they're funny and musical and catchy, particularly the doctor's songs.

3693947,3,B001M5UDGS,"If only this thing had been an extra 15-20 minutes longer, with an ending that compared to the rest of the content, I would have given it 5 stars. I really did enjoy everything until the last 5 minutes. I know that may seem a bit drastic to deduct 2 stars from my rating over 5 minutes, but endings are very important to me. That's the last thing you see before the show/movie/whatever is over. If I am left with a crappy ending then I don't get the consolation of more content. Instead I have to sit there brooding over the lack of effort put into that ending.

I was also confused by what the Blu-Ray box said on the back. It showed 92 minutes of content, which I take to mean the show itself is 92 minutes long and the 90+ minutes of bonus material is separate. Perhaps I misread it, but if it does say 92 minutes then why the hell is it only 40 something?

Like I said before, I thoroughly enjoyed the rest of the show. Everyone has a fairly decent voice, especially NPH. I suppose it's no surprise he has a nice voice considering his time on Broadway. I loved the way Horrible interacted with Hammer, and Hammer's over-the-top macho attitude towards women had me going a bit as well. The music for each piece was great, and I even listened to the lyrics, which normally I don't bother with in any song. This aside, I don't regret giving this show 3 stars. I really expected more from Joss Whedon with all the other works he's done. My girlfriend and I were actually sitting there for a while watching the credits, hoping that it was a fake ending because I honestly felt as though zero effort was put into that ending.",1294099200,2,1623,4.300653594771242

3693949,1,B001M5UDGS,"If I were simply rating the entertainment value of the music, it would be 5/5 easily.  However, I feel compelled to rate this 1/5 due to the terrible video quality, as well as the terrible user experience provided by Amazon.

The video quality when streamed or played through Unbox is unacceptable for a $5 video.  The video quality is, at best, on par with Youtube (which is free).  The download, when played through Unbox on Windows is equally poor.

However, when played through Windows Media Player, the quality is a bit better.  Unfortunately, there are still plenty of encoding artifacts (which I would expect in a free video, but not in a video I payed for).  Some of these are extremely noticeable, especially near the end of the musical.  Also, if you were hoping to play the video with your favorite non-WMP video player, you're out of luck, due to the DRM scheme used by Amazon.

So, overall, if you are fine paying $5 to download a ~850MB file to watch a mediocre quality copy of a great musical, go ahead and get it.  But if you can find a copy elsewhere, that's probably a better bet.",1293408000,4,1098,4.527918781725888

I don't much care for musicals, but the music in this movie is so good that I've listened to the soundtrack on youtube more than a few times. Don't do that first, though, because it'll ruin the plot, which is the best part.

The plot had me completely hooked from the beginning. Dr. Horrible, who is an out-of-luck super genius with half-baked plans for fixing our broken world, is such an honest character played so well by Neil Patrick Harris that I think I felt every emotion the character did the entire way through the plot. That's not something I can say about many goofy superhero musicals - or many movies period.

I watched for Free Online when it first came out, I watched it at a friends when the downloaded them from iTunes, and I rented the DVD to show it to friends. It was the DVD that hooked me. I had to own this DVD because of 'Commentary the Musical'. In fact, when I hear someone saw it online and liked it, I tell them about 'Commentary the Musical' and even take it to parties just to show the brilliance of that alternate track.

The normal commentary is full of interesting facts, but 'Commentary the Musical' is like watching a whole second movie all by self.

And even on DVD it is great. It loses little of its charm. (Of course the Vlogs looked more realistic when watched online)
But that's what it is, on DVD... The extras are fun but meagre... The Commentary Musical is... hard to describe. It sounds a bit forced at parts and the singing makes it not so easy to understand all the commentaries, but still a very fresh and nice idea.
However there is one big Minus for this release (hence only 4/5 stars)
The subtitles...
Being German I was amazed and happy when I read that there would be German subtitles so I would be able to show it to my friends with fewer understanding of the English language...
We had a friend over a few days after the shipment arrived...
We decided to switch the subtitles off then after barely 2 Minutes into the Movie...
It was atrocious! Grammar mistakes, spelling mistakes and translations that looked like they had just thrown the text into any online translator and what they got out, they've put on the DVD.
I was a bit disappointed to say the least... Sure it makes the movie a bit more understandable for people who don't speak any English... but with a little effort, or someone who knows German, they could have just proof-read it at least once...
It seems they didn't...
So I really recommend watching it without Subtitles... at least without German ones... I'm not sure about the other languages, but I suppose there won't be much of a difference.",1290902400,3,1484,4.541044776119403

What else do you need to know? This low-budget but very clever spoof on the classic comic book adventure is full of laughs and catchy tunes, espcially for fans of comic books, superheroes, and Joss Whedon (the lead writer). The beginning is a little slow, but it picks up right away with a sweet serenade to the girl he loves but can't talk to, and it keeps getting better from there. The characters are unusual but engaging, and have a great time turning the conventions of the superhero story on its ear. Short, sweet, and unpredictable - this is not a movie you see everyday.

P.S. Love this movie! Love the music! I listen to it everyday.

3693991,5,B001M5UDGS,"Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog is not your typical movie based on the zany universe of comic book heroes and villains.  It is a film which dispels the veneer of the public icons and reveals the truth about social outcasts.  Joss Whedon has managed to create one of the most lovable anti-heroes to date.  Whedon somehow encourages us to want Dr. Horrible to succeed.  Though Dr. Horrible is meant to be rotten to the core, he reveals his good nature at times and a desire for social change.

What makes the experience enjoyable, is that this deep topic is conveyed through the medium of humor.  The words of each song not only make you laugh but cause you to marinate on what is being presented.  The lyrics are further enhanced by Neil Patrick Harris' brilliant delivery.  The man manages to pack so many conflicting emotions in every note and truly reveals Dr. Horrible's dual nature.

The good performances do not end with Harris though!  Felicia Day's portrayal of Penny emanates the archetype of the real ""do-gooder.""  Her character is excellently juxtaposed by Nathon Fillion's despicably self-righteous Captain Hammer.  Even the minor appearances by Whedon's colleagues were a joy to watch.  Its obvious that everyone brought their A-game to the set.

As far as the DVD itself, its full of extras that raving fans of the movie will love.  Commentary may seem like one of the last features one would visit when going through the extras menu but certainly not in this case.  You'll even get to hear the Whedons belt out a few tunes about the making of the film or each other.  Another bonus feature I recommend checking out is the Evil League of Evil auditions.  It showcases some of the awesome creativity of the Dr. Horrible fans out there.

All in all, whether you are new to Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog or a long time admirer, this DVD is certainly worth the purchase.",1287964800,2,1879,4.743827160493828

3694008,5,B001M5UDGS,"Every once in awhile, you get to watch something fresh, inventive, and entertaining.  ""Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog"" is a 42 minute musical about a budding evil villain who is aspiring to join the Evil League of Evil, defeat his nemesis, and get the girl.  Neil Patrick Harris (currently starring in the TV sitcom ""How I met your Mother) plays the villain, Dr. Horrible; Nathan Fillion (who starred in ""Firefly"") plays his nemesis, the somewhat anti-heroic hero Captain Hammer; and Felicia Day (who played ""Vi"" in Buffy the Vampire Slayer) is the love interest.

The DVD version contains the musical, commentaries by the cast and creators (including a somewhat tangential singing commentary!), some ""making of"" featurettes, and 10 Evil League of Evil Application videos from fans.

For a low-budget effort, it looks great, the actors are top-notch and are perfect for their roles, the story is alternately funny and touching, and the songs are fantastic.  Believe me, you'll be playing the DVD over again several times just for the songs ... or like me, you'll be considering ordering the soundtrack.

The entire production was done on a budget of just over $200,000, and was shown for free on the web for a time.  The cast and the crew were not paid at the time of filming.  The intent appeared to be to drum up interest for ""Dr Horrible"" so that downloads from iTunes and DVD sales would pay the cast and crew, and also hopefully make some profit.

Without giving anything away, I think the ending could have been a little better, but on the whole, this is fantastic entertainment and well worth purchasing.

If you have a sense of humor and can appreciate an off-beat tale told well, I very highly recommend this DVD.  Bring on Dr Horrible 2!",1285200000,2,1747,4.809364548494983

I was first introduced to the existence of Dr. Horrible a couple of years ago during the summer of '08 when the writer's strike was still in effect. I was instant messaging with a friend of mine in California when she mentioned something called ""Dr. Horrible,"" and she wouldn't leave me alone because I had no idea what she was talking about. So she found me some streaming links of the show, I watched them, and found them thoroughly amusing. A year later, I finally discovered Joss Whedon's masterpiece in Firefly and its man-child Serenity, developing a new respect that is probably more prevalent in the rampant fandom out there than anything else. And another year after that, in only my second viewing of Dr. Horrible I think I'm starting to see why Joss has so many fans. Dr. Horrible is an oddity, to say the least. Its short running time, low-budget roots, Internet crowd, and yet addicting quirkiness have come to entertain millions of people. But with star power like Neil Patrick Harris, Nathan Fillion, and Felicia Day, is it any surprise? While only running a mere 42 minutes (the equivalent of a single TV series episode), I find it amazing how so much comedy, drama, and tragedy were crammed in. And to top it all of, it's a musical, but not just any musical, a supervillain musical! Such subtle emotions like love, hope, and a greater calling to do good (or horrible) things is just one of the many characteristics I think any person goes through, be they regular Joe's or aspiring super people. NPH, in all of his natural charisma, plays the role of Dr. Horrible flawlessly. I never watched Doogie Howser growing up, but the ""cool guy"" image he's had ever since Harold & Kumar has been a joy to watch. Nathan Fillion is essentially an egomaniac superhero that, if you're any familiar with his work in the Firefly universe, makes for some great comedy relief. And finally, Felicia Day plays the cute damsel and love interest of the two with great, uh.. cuteness. Props to her for a beautiful singing voice, too. If you've yet to see this, Dr. Horrible is an over-the-top, silly, and wacky musical satire concoction that's short in length, but certainly a winner.

Video - 4.0

Being a made-for-Internet production and filmed in a total of two weeks, you'd think something low-budget like Dr. Horrible wouldn't translate well to BD. But in fact, it actually looks pretty good. The color scheme doesn't amount itself to much outside of Dr. Horrible's lab coat, Captain Hammer's black t-shirt, and various amounts of street clothes, but image detail is still quite good. Skin textures are relatively tight, and contrast levels give the overall picture a kind of cartoony look. On the flip side, there's also a lot of noise in the darker or more dimly-lit scenes, and a few instances of artifacts/debris pop up every now and then. There's also the issue of contrast getting blown out of proportion during the ""special effects"" sequences, like when a giant Dr. Horrible is wreaking havoc on the city. But given that the budget was probably half the cost of some sports cars, I think it looks great.

Audio - 4.5

Dr. Horrible is presented with a very excellent DTS-HD 5.1 track that better captures the true essence of the show. Dialogue is clean-cut from the center channel with what few, if any, sound effects coming mainly from the front sound stage. But the real star of the show (the music) is phenomenally delivered and dispersed throughout every speaker. Accompaniment itself actually has a decent amount of separation from the vocals resulting in a fine representation of the show's soundtrack. High and low ends of the music/vocals never waver and almost make you think it should just be an audio BD. Integration of the pre-recorded songs to the video are flawless as well, and the BD as a whole really does justice to the musical numbers. The only downside, really, is the lack of LFEs. There is one point in the show where something blows up making for a quick little rumble, but that's it. Certainly, the music sounds as good as it ever will, though.

Extras - 5.0

Comes with 2 commentaries, making-of, Evil League of Evil application videos, outtakes, and a brief interview with the ELE itself. Probably the funniest and most innovative special I've experienced yet, though, is the musical commentary. Whedon and gang actually went through the trouble of composing and constructing songs and dialogue in a semi-Broadway fashion to fill in pretty much every single second of the feature's run time. Dialogue is high-pitched and fast just like you'd hear on stage, and a lot of the songs are quite entertaining, yet perfectly comprehensible as potential standalone commentaries themselves. It's just as strange, quirky, and fun as the show itself. Also of high entertainment value are the ELE applications. Much of the applicants are very creative considering these are low-budget and fan-made, and I think it's awesome that Whedon was cool enough to actually put them on the disc. The making-of is only about 20 minutes, but provides quite a bit of insight to the composition of the idea, the music, and the casting. Rounding it all out is a painfully short ELE interview, which is funny in its own right, but I would've loved more Fake Thomas Jefferson and Dead (David) Bowie screen time. All in all, the extras are a joy to watch and compliment the feature very well.

Overall - 4.5

In the last couple of years, Joss Whedon has really managed to capture my attention with his brilliant attention to quirkiness. First was Firefly and Serenity, and now now Dr. Horrible. The comedy is subtle, snarky, and genuinely funny all at the same time. With outstanding performances by the main three cast and a very catchy soundtrack, Dr. Horrible became an Internet sensation, and rightfully so. Presented by New Video with adequate video, excellent audio, and all the goofy extras that were on the DVD, Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog comes highly recommended an is a must-have for Whedonites.",1283817600,6,6022,4.827519379844961
3694011,5,B001M5UDGS,"I first saw this at school. A classmate of mine brought it to class and we watched between our classes. I honestly didn't pay much attention to it the first time. But a few weeks later I saw it on here and decided to buy since I needed my order to over $25 so I could get free shipping. It was the smartest thing I ever done. I loved Whedon's Buffy and watch it regularly so I was familiar with his stuff. After watching Dr. Horrible about 10 times in a row I knew all the words to all the songs. The story is easy to follow and quickly engaging. Dr. Horrible is the villian but you immediately fall for him. Captain Hammer is arrogant in the best way possible. And while Penny isn't my favorite in the movie, Felicia Day is an amazing actress.

A must have for everyone.,1282953600,,323,4.225806451612903
3694013,5,B001M5UDGS,"I originally bought this as a gift for my best friend, who had introduced me to Dr. Horrible when it first came out. The next holiday season, he ended up giving me another copy so that I could have one as well.

I'm going to start off by saying I'm a huge Joss Whedon fan. From Buffy, to Angel, to Firefly, Serenity, and Dr. Horrible, I love it all. I believe this man is amazingly talented. But I'm going to try to review it as unbiased and fairly as possible (from this aspect, at least.)

First off, I'll talk about the casting. The main character, played by Neil Patrick Harris, is actually my favorite male actor. Again, I'm biased. He's funny, handsome, charming, and can fit into lots of roles. He's an amazing actor (how many gay men can make hundreds of thousands to millions of people think that they're a manwhoring womanizer?) and very versatile and silly. (side note: He's actually a magician, too!) As Dr. Horrible, he is able to encompass the role of deadly serious, evil (but in a sort of silly way), and comedic. He's also got a very, very nice voice.

Felicia Day is, quite possibly my favorite female actress (Again, I'll try to remain unbiased.) She's cute, quirky, and managed to capture the optimism and benevolence of Penny beautifully. Her voice, while not the absolute best I've ever heard, is quite nice, and neither her voice nor her looks are hard on the eyes.

Nathan Fillion is great, too. Playing Captain Hammer, he is hilarious as he exudes extreme narcissism (quite well, I may add. Have some real life practice in this, Nate?) as well as a playing a good-looking antagonist.

The funny thing about this is that the protagonist would usually be the ""good guy""-- Captain Hammer, in most movies-- and the ""bad guy"" (Dr. Horrible) would be the antagonist. However, here it is reversed, with you choosing to favor and root for the ""bad guy"", making the antagonist Dr. Horrible.

The plot is nice, not too deep, and great, if you like musicals. Be prepared to break out giggling repeatedly and want to listen to the soundtrack (which you can also purchase.)

For anyone, Whedon fanatic or not, who likes silly things and musicals, I would definitely recommend Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog.",1282694400,,2219,4.674358974358975
3694014,5,B001M5UDGS,"""Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog"" was conceived as an online phenomenon during the 2008 writers' strike, and since most screenwriters never produce anything worth looking at anyway, I found myself doubly drawn to this brilliant little film. Directed and largely written by Joss Whedon, and starring Neil Patrick Harris as Dr. Horrible, the film is a musical romp through the world of evil science and the emotionally stunted scientists who live there. Dr. Horrible, of course, has plans for world domination, but is equally enamored of Penny (Felicia Day,) the fellow laundromat user of his dreams. Foiling Horrible's nefarious plans is Captain Hammer (Nathan Fillion,) and the musical mayhem that ensues is nothing short of inspired genius.

The film at 42 minutes is very short, but includes numerous wonderful extras that make this more than worth the money in any format. ""Commentary! The Musical"" includes more new music from the cast and creators. There's also a commentary track with the cast and creators, a ""making of"" feature, and assorted other documentation on the ""League of Evil."" This DVD shows that smart and talented people can make an excellent and entertaining movie without any of the corporate or union trappings of conventional Hollywood productions, and I admire the skill and daring of the creators, cast, and crew. I am no particular fan of musicals as a rule, but I am making a very rare exception here, and I give ""Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog"" an unequivocal recommendation.",1282694400,2,1503,5.159836065573771

Definately watch it with the commentary after you have already watched it once.

But his archenemy (the superhero Captain Hammer) always seems to thwart his every move. Billy has a plan that could get him into the Evil League of Evil and win Penny's heart, but only if the irritating Captain Hammer could stay away.

Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog was created as an online miniseries musical by fan-favorite Joss Whedon. Neil Patrick Harris plays Billy/Dr. Horrible to pure perfection. He's sadly sweet, funny, and completely loveable. Felicia Day is Penny, the shy and demure focus of both Billy and Captain Hammer's attentions. And Captain Hammer is played by Nathan Fillion, who much like his Castle character is pompous and narcissistic and hysterical.

Besides the satirical premise, the other highlights are when Billy bursts into song. These unconventional characters and songs make for a hilarious and extremely entertaining musical. It's fresh, witty, and absolutely charming. And now this cult hit is available on Blu-ray, which I'll be watching again and again.

This is a review of the May 25th release of the Dr. Horrible Blu-ray.

As a sat down to watch this movie this afternoon I have to say that I was really disappointed in the picture quality.  The colors were mostly ok, but a lot of scenes seemed washed out or blown out.  The biggest and most glaring thing you notice with this Blu-ray is the grain.  Every flat background is so grainy that it feels a bit like VHS grain, only finer.

My setup doesn't really qualify me to comment on the audio quality so I won't.

The movie as a stand-alone product is fantastic and I think previous reviews cover it just as well as I can.  If you don't own this in any media you really need to but it, but don't expect great things from this Blu-ray.",1274745600,2,928,5.181208053691275
3694093,5,B001M5UDGS,"I took a long time waiting to watch this specifically because of all the good reviews. It almost never seems to fail that when everyone loves something, it just rarely lives up to the hype. I'm extremely happy to say that Dr. Horrible *is* every bit as good as everyone says it is.

The ""movie"" is actually made up of several podcasts that were released for the general internet, all of which follow the would be super-villain Dr. Horrible as he attempts to battle his nemesis, win the love of the girl he's crushing on, as well as win a coveted spot in Evil League of Evil. Life never runs easy for anyone, especially superheroes, so Dr. Horrible's going to have a long way to go before he meets any of his goals.

I loved this movie. Seriously, I wish I'd given in sooner. Not only is the acting superb, but the music is awesome & Neil Patrick Harris is as cute & hot as ever!  Part of me wishes the movie was longer, but overall I'm happy with it- I think making it longer might have interfered with the storytelling & fun of the movie.

I watched this via a video download, so I unfortunately can't vouch for the DVD disc quality. I can definitely say though, that this is worth a purchase in one format or another!",1274313600,,1219,4.310043668122271

3694098,4,B001M5UDGS,"Neill Patrick Harris, perhaps most wellknown in his role as Barney Stinson from the sit-com ""how I met your mother"", is - in the words of Barney - awesome, in the lead role as Billy, aka Dr Horrible. The title role is a super villain wannabe. In order to impress ""Bad Horse"" - leader of the ""evil league of evil"", Dr Horrible must commit an oustanding crime.  At the same time he must win the heart of his love interest Penny, a girl he has met at the laundromat, but at the start of the story not yet dared to speak to. The task is not an easy one, mostly due to his arch Nemesis Captain Hammer, the most respulsive super hero since, ... well ever. A minor role is played by Simon Helberg - known from Big Bang theory - as the moist man. He is Billy's close friend and a rather pathetic super villain, who ""at his most bad ass makes people want to take a shower"". The story is really funny, with lots of good songs played frequently throughout the rather short story (43 minutes). If you are familiar with the super hero genre, you will likely appreciate the humour even more. The main singing performaces are made by Neill Patrick Harris, Felicias Day (as Penny)and Nathan Fillion (Captain Hammer), who all are capable of competing well with most pure musical artists. While the story is indeed a short one, the dvd comes with lots of special features, where the most impressive one is a whole new set of good songs, where many of the actors with smaller roles gets the opportunity to show off their vocal skills. While lot of the content has been freely available on both youtube as well as the sing-along blog's own website, their is still plenty of extra material to justify buying this dvd.",1273449600,,1696,4.4185303514377

Penny can be heard clearly coming from left audio channel while standing on right side of screen and Dr. Horrible is heard from right audio channel while standing on left side of screen.  Kinda bothersome to have a flaw like this that I can't ignore whenever I watch it now.

3694114,5,B001M5UDGS,"I bought this DVD knowing only that it was the brain child of the Whedon's and a musical.  I loved the Buffy musical episode enough to buy the soundtrack and was expecting the same quality and variety in this film.  I must say, I was somewhat disappointed.  I didn't think there was as much variety in the film music, genre-wise, as was in the Buffy musical.  Though I enjoyed the film, I was prepared to give it three stars here.  It was enjoyable, but nothing spectacular.  I figured that first I should check out the features and saw Commentary! The Musical.

It was everything I dreamed, and more!  Commentary! The Musical is, of course, the DVD commentary you'd expect, but by all of the cast done entirely in a musical format that is HILARIOUS and quite the variety of music.  The lyrics were hysterical; I laughed the whole commentary. I was expecting a couple of songs, but was delighted to discover that they actually did a whole film-length musical (all the way through the credits, too!) that is just gut-busting funny musical commentary.  I'd give it ten stars if I could.  It was over the top in the best way.

So, for those buying this expecting the Buffy variety/quality of musical, you won't find quite that level in the film, but you will find that and more in the commentary.

This 45 minute short film directed by Buffy the Vampire Slayer Joss Whedon. It is cute and a tribute to evil mad scientists everywhere.

The supporting cast of Nathan (Firefly, Castle)  Fillion and Felicia day makes this DVD interesting. It looks like a throw back to a 1940 serial and musical too.

The cast commentary track is great fun too. Everyone seems to have a great time.

3694123,5,B001M5UDGS,"My friend told me about this fantastic movie.

People who previously posted have been complaining about everything from length to dialog to singing, but most obviously the DVD production. Let's clear a couple things up.

1- don't believe what you read. I bought this exact product from Amazon.com and it is NOT a DVD-R anymore. It is the real thing.

2- This was originally written and created during the writer's strike that brought about completely awful movies (ex. Juno), and so, yes, the script is not written in the same way as your average blockbuster, Titanic, way.

3- All the actors in this movie did it on a volunteer basis.

Despite these, as some would call them, setbacks. This movie is a sparkling gem of movie excellence. It is wacky and corny, resulting in one of the most excellent pieces of movie genius created. 42 minutes or so of comic genius, the movie centers around Neil Patrick Harris as Dr. Horrible, a 20-something scientist with a deep crush on a girl in a laundromat, and the burning feeling that something is inherently wrong with ""the system"" and that HE needs to be the one to fix it. (oh, and a need to be accepted by the ""Evil League of Evil"") Nathan Fillion stars as the dimwitted rival/ superhero to Dr. Horrible's scheming.

Basically, yes, it has your generic ""scientist, who blogs constantly about his works"" plot-line, and the songs have wonderfully corny lyrics. However, the quality of the acting from the performers balances out whatever someone may have against cheesy lyrics in a ""made-to-be-cheesy"" film.

Bad Horse recommends buying this film.",1269216000,,1591,4.8487084870848705

And don't let the fact that it is done all in song scare you away, it's done so well that my friends who hate musicals with every fiber of their being LOVED it because the actors were all on top of their game, the plot grips your attention and because it was an hour of plain old fun. Even the special features are hilarious...and there's even a second commentary done in song--you'll laugh so hard, you'll cry.

3694127,5,B001M5UDGS,"""Doctor Horrible's Sing-Along Blog"" is a musical about a mad scientist (Doctor Horrible) who wants to make it into this evil league, but so far all of his plots have been foiled by Captain Hammer.  We end up seeing two plot lines that twist together in this story, as Doctor Horrible's actually a normal guy named Billy when he's not bent on causing evil.  Billy has fallen in love with Penny and wants to get into the evil league and take over the world.  He figures that it'll be easy enough, but Captain Hammer not only ruins his plan but steals his girl too.

The cast is simply amazing!  If you love Neil Patrick Harris, Nathan Fillion, and/or Felicia Day then this is the movie for you!  I have to say that Nathan Fillion's portrayal of Captain Hammer was even reminiscent of his role on ""Castle"" at time which made it even more fun!  Neil Patrick Harris is just simply wonderful in this!  And though Felicia Day doesn't seem as well known as the other two in the cast, she is simply wonderful to watch and listen to her sing!  I absolutely love her in ""The Guild"" and in this!

I have to say that I didn't set the bar very high when I was told about this, but I watched it and thought that it was simply fantastic!  It's fun and the tunes totally stay with you.  I have the soundtrack on my iPod now!  I'd recommend this for people who like either anything that this fantastic cast is in or if you don't know any of the actors then it'd be a safe bet if you like musicals and comics ;)

This is a very fun superhero-type of show.

It has a very different feeling though, I think, because I found myself rooting for Doctor Horrible instead of Captain Hammer.

Neal Patrick Harris is compelling and superb, Nathan Fillion is terrific as the blunt hero type-and a better singer than expected and Felicia Day lights up the screen.
  If you think you do not like musicals, try this on for size. You will be surprised, thrilled and darkly pleased. Visually, fantastic, drawing on a wealth of lore and drawing you into the story before you know it. This is, in a way, a tragedy, but not for the viewers.

3694146,5,B001M5UDGS,"While Dr. Horrible's Sing-along Blog is, indeed, hilarious, it is also wrenchingly sad. The reason that it resonates so deeply is the tragedy and pain that is coupled with the comedy. What makes this work so good is the poignancy that is so deftly carried through it by the major actors, the music, and (of course) Whedon's direction.

I had never so much as heard of Whedon or any of the major actors in the piece when I first saw it. This short piece is just a jewel of a work, with the writing, acting, songwriting and singing, camera work - all of it done superbly, with just the right touch.

Taking the superhero and arch-villain, and twisting them 180 degrees around to make the superhero be the bad guy, and the arch-villain into the sympathetic protagonist, Whedon gave himself a playground full of opportunity for quirky moments of humor. And the deadpan acceptance of a horse (A HORSE!!!) as the leading arch-criminal of the evildoers is another beautiful stroke - it is just amazing that it is carried off so well.

Great stuff.",1262908800,,1040,4.641304347826087

EDIT

Having now purchased the Blu-Ray version I can report that it is indeed in full HD and looks very much better for it.
It's high end HD camcorder quality not cinema camera quality but that's still a massive improvement over DVD at 52"" in my case.

Interestingly it caused my viewers to notice that the selection of pans (cooking pots) hanging in Dr Horrible's kitchen during his first blog closely resemble a Firefly spacecraft when in shadow. Deliberate? Maybe.",1262822400,,647,4.8108108108108105

The extra singing commentary is very clever and unexpectedly good (Who knew that Nathan Fillion could really sing). The clarity of the video is somewhat disappointing.

3694159,3,B001M5UDGS,"My college-age kid was crazy about this short film and was convinced I would love it. Always a red flag for an parent-type adult, since I don't want to hurt his feelings by disliking his favorite show.

But I can't say I was crazy about Dr. Horrible.

As a semi-realistic, semi-parody of the superhero, science fiction and musical theater genres, Dr. Horrible did have potential. Dr. Horrible is a regular guy who is a mad scientist at war with his nemesis, Captain Hammer, for the heart of the lovely Penny. Though super-smart and super-powerful, the characters act out the nerd-jock emotional spectrum. Which could have been funny if developed more. But the songs, at least at first hearing, were not memorable, at least to me. My kid, on the other hand, sings them all the time. The plot is silly and light, then suddenly and strangely gets heavy and brooding right at the end.

Dr. Horrible was evidently cobbled together during the recent Hollywood writer's strike. It was thrown together in a short time, and it shows. The story has holes, the music needs polishing and the characters need fleshing out. It's a work of energy and fun, but seems to have been made less for the viewer than for the actors and crew. I personally found Neil Patrick Harris to be a bit full of himself for my taste, which didn't help my overall impression of the film. The extras seemed to be the actors and directors congratulating themselves for being clever. Hmm.

Or maybe I'm just an old fart who doesn't appreciate humor that ""hits"" late teens and twenty-somethings. YMMV. AT the end of the day, I'm glad I watched it, if only to see how out of synch I am with my kid's generation.",1259107200,,1671,4.616161616161616

3694168,5,B001M5UDGS,"Interestingly, Joss Whedon and Co. have created something that works on 1) an internet level, 2) a television level, and 3) a musical level. It was originally released on the internet in small chunks, similar to the ""blog"" of the title. But it is best watched on the DVD, where you can enjoy the larger picture -- and the hidden gems all over the piece -- and play the music through a larger home theater setup. Finally, Joss gets musicals in a way that no other current songwriter/musical-composer does. Around the time of Rodgers and Hammerstein, plot and song began to get mixed together in ways never before attempted, and it changed the face of musical theater forever. Joss Whedon understands how to weave plot throughout his songs, and that elevates this and the other Whedon musicals above most other current attempts at musical theater on the big and small screen (High School Musical, Fame, Glee).

That said, the unfortunate thing about this musical is how short it is. Maybe we need a second round? The songs are spectacular, the singing is wonderful, and the plot is vintage Joss Whedon. Highly recommended.",1254960000,2,1120,4.833333333333333

Brilliant performances all around from Neil Patrick Harris, Nathan Fillion, and Felicia Day - who knew Nathan Fillion could sing? The sheer amount of success Dr. Horrible has achieved in such a short time should speak for itself. It's a home project that was born in the midst of a crisis and has gained critical acclaim.

Neil Patrick Harris makes a fantastic Dr. Horrible, a wannabe bad guy who is actually much more of a good guy that purported hero Captain Hammer.  The criminally underutilized Nathan Fillion is a great Captain Hammer, the narcissistic superhero who is the toast of LA.  And who will ever forget Dobbin as Bad Horse, perhaps the greatest screen villain of all time?  Or the Moist Guy, whose powers of dampening and soggification make him a great henchman?  Joss Whedon makes all this craziness work, and on top of it some great songs make Dr. Horrible an excellent and entertaining musical.  You won't believe this is the same man who brought us the flat and joyless ""Dollhouse.""

3694190,2,B001M5UDGS,"Edit: 08-24-09: The following will be a ""real"" critique of Dr. Horrible. After going over the various comments that were left on this and realizing the error that I have made, it is time actually put up a review. The entire piece lasts roughly 42 minutes, broken down into 3 parts. On its surface, Dr. Horrible could be comparable to a superhero version of Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner; Dr. Horrible being the Coyote and Captain Hammer the road runner. This parallel exists mainly in Dr. Horrible's constant attempts to create evil plans and Captain Hammer foiling them. As I said, this comparison only exists on the surface, for as we look deeper into the piece we realize that ""Dr. Horrible"" is really an analysis of the ""average man"" (beta male) competing against the alpha male. Most viewers can relate to this constant struggle to be recognized and understood for their talents.

In my opinion, to fully grasp the complexity of ""Dr. Horrible"" one would have to watch the various shows the actors have been in; i.e. How I Met Your Mother, Firefly and The Guild. With those characters in mind, it is fascinating watching how they interact in the world of ""Dr. Horrible,"" sometimes the very opposite of the characters they had previously played. Watching Neil Patrick Harris play Barney in How I Met Your Mother, caused me to go into ""Dr. Horrible"" with an existing frame of reference, that was ultimately shattered; this made the viewing experience that more interesting. Nathan Fillon plays an over-exaggerated form of Cpt. Malcolm Reynolds and Felicia Day sheds her gamer side to play a character who likes to save the world in her own way.

The success of these characters is result of a strong script and a great relationship between the actors. As I stated in my title, the concept is quite bland, but the strength of this piece was the of the characters and their interactions.

I would definitely recommend ""Dr. Horrible"" and if I could change my rating it would be to a 4.

Dave.

Ps. I have left the previous ""review"" so as to see what I had done and why I re-did my critique. To those that commented I thank you.

Edit: 08-22-09 : Although I still stand by my questioning of why we should pay for this when it is free on the internet, it was brought to my attention (or rather I was reminded of what the writers had gone through) the fact that the studios were involved in bilking Mr. Whedon out of monies. I guess the anger that I have, is that he is not the only one hurting, as we are currently in a recession. Like I said in my review, Dr. Horrible is a brilliant piece of comedy that used the power of the internet to make it a success. To package it into something like a dvd, takes away from the original intent.

This rating is in regards to the dvd, not the show. I loved Dr. Horrible and thought that Neil Patrick Harris did a great job portraying this bumbling super-villian. However, there is another supervillian: Joss Whedon and Hollywood. How can they make the consumers pay money for something that was created for the internet and was provided on the internet for free. I understand the need to make money to support other projects, but to blatantly take advantage of the consumer is wrong. In fact, it is abusive.

I give it at least 2 stars, because the premise of the show was brilliantly executed. In fact, it is one of my favorite Whedon productions. The constant bickering between Dr. Horrible and Captain Hammer for the love of Penny was crisp and very ingenious. Due to this, I have seen Dr. Horrible numerous times. But I refuse to be pulled down and directly abused by the corporations who want to force the consumer to pay; in my case I am just a unemployed college student.

Just remember I like the show, but dislike the abuse of Hollywood.

I watched this online about a month after the last part was released and hoped from that day there would be a DVD.

The Commentary tracks are delicious.  As is the SING ALONG Commentary!  Some of the funniest things I've ever heard as well as the darker side of getting everything you ever wanted.  This film goes from Slapstick to Noir in a little over forty minutes.

You've remembered dear Doogie
You've watched Harold and Kumar
You've seen How I Meet your Mother.
Now heres a short film
You simply must see it!
Send a copy to your brother!

From Firefly, comes the guy
Whose handsome and tall
But due to a writer strike
He's in this musical
The Hammer is a tool
He acts like a fool
But all think he's cool

Except the bad doctor
Who says he has found her
The girl that he loves
Does not know what he does
He's evil and bad
But the girl is so good

How must a villian do things that are bad
When the girl that he loves makes him glad
When you find out you will definitely be sad
But that Captain Hammer makes him so mad!

Neil Patrick Harris and Nathan Fillon

3694206,5,B001M5UDGS,"For those not familiar with the concept, Dr. Horrible is a romantic super-villain musical, which is just as bizarre and charming as it sounds. It's written and directed by Joss Whedon (of Buffy/Angel/Firefly/Serenity fame), who is a man who knows how to put together some tight, polished, good quality entertainment.

I suppose the important things for the DVD review are the region code and the extras. This DVD is region-free; I don't remember reading that in the product description, so held off on buying it for ages waiting for a European release, but it should work on any DVD player around the world. Also, the extras make the DVD well worth purchasing. ""Commentary: The Musical"" is great fun, hearing the cast and crew bicker through the medium of song; and the application videos for the Evil League of Evil are entertaining, and show the kind of level of effort enthused Whedon fans go to.",1246838400,,899,4.837662337662338

3694209,5,B001M5UDGS,"I don't want to drop any spoilers into the review. Suffice to say that everything about Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog works. It was a pleasure to see online when it was first released and the DVD takes it a step further. For those of you who don't know, during the Writer's Strike a couple of years ago, Joss Whedon (creator of ""Buffy, the Vampire Slayer"", ""Angel"" and ""Firefly"") and his brothers and friends decided to make a film and release it on the Internet for free. And so was born Dr. Horrible. From the casting through the music and production values, this is a gem of a piece; arguably better than most film projects coming out of LA.
When the DVD became available, I bought it in spite of being able to download it for free off the Net. First, I wanted to show my support financially since I enjoyed it so much; second, I assumed that they would exponentially up the enjoyment ante with a DVD and I was right! The disc includes the movie and commentary (including a musical version called ""Commentary!""), as well as fan audition videos to join the Evil League of Evil (you gotta watch the blog to understand). But the fun doesn't end there, folks! Oh, no! There are Easter Eggs in that there disc. And clues in plain sight for any that would search them out. (Of course, you can Google for the answers but that's a lot like using the answer page when doing the crossword puzzle; the finding is most of the fun).
In short, buy this disc. Then buy copies for your friends and relatives. You won't be sorry.",1246320000,,1516,4.437275985663082
3694210,5,B001M5UDGS,"I came across this show thanks to a friend of mine. She told me it was an absolute must see. She then proceeded to sit me down and had me watch it right then and there. I had no idea what to expect. I have to say, what then proceeded for the next 40 odd minutes was brilliant.

Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog had me enchanted with it from the moment the show began all the way up until the ending note. Neil Patrick Harris plays an ""Evil Genius Scientist"" known as Dr. Horrible/Billy, along with Nathan Fillion (Capt. Hammer) and Felicia Day (Penny).

All Dr Horrible wants is to join the Evil League of Evil. Yet along the way we find that he is in love with a girl named Penny, which he has trouble speaking to and has a nemesis called Capt. Hammer who is a really self-absorbed supposed good guy. In this comedic musical blog we follow along with Dr. Horrible as he tries to make an impression on the league and work up the nerve to finally talk to Penny. However everything tumbles down around Dr. Horrible when he accidently introduces Penny to Capt. Hammer and they hit it off.

But this isn't just a normal love triangle. This is a MUSICAL love triangle that unfolds before your eyes. Every song in this show is very catchy and makes you want to learn the words so that you can truly sing along like the title suggests. I found myself listening to each and every song over and over again. It really adds to the blogs appeal. And each of those actors really can sing.

Also along with the normal commentary and special features found on most dvds, this dvd has a musical commentary which is about another 40 oddish minutes of absolute hilariousness. I had no idea what a musical commentary would be like, but the cast of Dr. Horrible and the geniuses behind it, delivered a great commentary that seemed like it could have been a seperate show all on its own.

In any case Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog is absolutely brilliant and enjoyable. And it is one of those shows that is just so much fun to sit around afterwards and start quoting; especially when you're with people who pick up on where the quote is from and can start quoting back. In my opinion it's a must see.",1246147200,,2178,4.354679802955665
3694211,5,B001M5UDGS,"I wasn't sure about a musical, but with Joss Whedon, Nathan Fillion and Neil Patrick Harris, I had to give it a try.  I'm glad I did! I loved the characters, the music was fun and the story was great.  I love the attempt to engage a new business model in delivering movie entertainment without the traditional studio model.  My only criticism (and it's mild) was the ending.  While I like that Joss didn't go with the obvious ""boy gets the girl"", the brief sadness of the ending seemed a little out of tune with the rest of the film.",1245974400,,533,4.3
3694212,5,B001M5UDGS,"I watched this on Hulu this weekend... and fell in love.  I can't wait for Amazon to ship me a copy, so I have one reserved at Borders and will be picking it up tonight.  A wanna-be super-villain with a video blog... and everyone sings!  What's not to love?!  (Yes, I know I should wait and review the DVD as a whole, ""Commentary! The Musical"" included, but I still won't be able to give it more than 5 stars.  I bought the album on iTunes, does that count?)

This project rose out of the dark days of the writers strike, when Joss Whedon decided to get out of the picket lines and make a statement that has continued to resound long after the picketers dispersed.  Along with his brothers, he conceived and financed this project entirely on his own - breaking the studio model -  for the sake of creativity, and to prove that EXCELLENT content can be produced on a minimalist budget (low 6-figures, he says, which is pretty impressive).  This production was then released via internet, with demand to watch it so high that it crashed the website the night it was released.

I can't say enough about the creativity and originality that this project showcases.  Not only the concept and content (again, singing super-villain with a video blog?!  WIN!), but the whole model with which it was produced and distributed.  In a few years, hindsight will be 20/20, and it will be clear that this really was a pioneer in the future of new media and its impact on how we watch produced content.  I know some people have complained about the DVD-R format... but doesn't that just add to the charm?!  It's a homemade project, folks!

Neil Patrick Harris, Felicia Day, and Nathan Fillion are all perfectly cast.  The songs are all brilliantly written and performed.  The story is superb... it's no wonder this has had such a successful reception! (""I mean successful in that I achieved my objective, less successful in that I introduced my arch-nemesis to the girl of my dreams..."")

So, for the sake of supporting great art and creativity (and just watching fantastic original content!), please BUY this DVD, and BUY the soundtrack (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CD/dp/B001M5UDH2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CD</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MP3/dp/B001GUJD2O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MP3</a>)!!

Except for Neil Patrick Harris, the cast was mostly unknowns who have, since the release online of the show, have made it into the ""big leagues"".

He is continually thwarted, however, by his nemesis, Captain Hammer (Nathan Fillion).

Despite two audio commentaries (one a campy, entertaining musical; the other an honest, standard commentary including such trivia as pointing out a Sarah Michelle Gellar cameo), and a set of hit-or-miss fan-submitted Evil League of Evil audition videos, this isn't going to appeal to everyone.

I really enjoyed it, and I still do, but this isn't a mainstream video.  Additionally, the webisodes themselves are so short (~45 minutes total) that my gut feeling after watching both commentaries and the E.L.E. videos was ""that's it?  well, okay.  I guess it was good.""

3694233,5,B001M5UDGS,"Even though (as of the time of this writing) you can still watch Dr. Horrible online for free, and can download it for a song, there are two very important reasons why you must get the DVD:  First, sales of the DVD help to cover the costs of production (including the salaries of the cast and crew).  There's already talk of a Dr. Horrible sequel in the works; so, if you want to insure that high-quality independent productions like Dr. Horrible continue to get made, you need to support the producers by buying the DVD.  Second (and more importantly, from your perspective), you've got to buy the DVD for the special features.  As you might expect, there are featurettes about the making of Dr. Horrible, and a very entertaining (and often hilarious) commentary track featuring the entire cast, all of the writers, and the director, discussing the making of Dr. Horrible.  There are also some ""Easter Eggs"" that you can hunt for.  But the real treats are: ""Commentary: The Musical"" and the Evil League of Evil (ELE) application videos.  As the name suggests, ""Commentary: The Musical"" is a second commentary track (again featuring the entire cast, all of the writers, and the director); but, instead of just talking about the making of Dr. Horrible, this time they actually SING about it.  And the songs on ""Commentary: The Musical"" are actually very good.  In my opinion, they are almost as entertaining as the songs in the Dr. Horrible musical itself.  In fact, I've still got some of the songs from ""Commentary: The Musical"" stuck in my head.  As for the ELE application videos, I was reluctant to watch them at first, assuming that they would be cheesy amateur videos sent in by fans.  But I was amazed to discover that they were all very well done, very professional, and very entertaining.  Do not pass up the opportunity to watch the ELE application videos.

I haven't said much about Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog itself, because I am assuming that, if you're considering buying this DVD, you must already be a fan of the musical.  After all, as I have already mentioned, Dr. Horrible is still available for free online viewing.  So, if you haven't seen it yet, go watch it (it's available at Hulu), then come back here and order the DVD.  In case you've never heard of Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog, it is a tragicomedy musical about a hapless supervillain (Dr. Horrible, played by Neil Patrick Harris), his superhero arch-nemesis (Captain Hammer, played by Nathan Fillion), and the woman they both love (Penny, played by Felicia Day).  It was created, co-written, and directed by Joss Whedon (the genius behind Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, Firefly, Serenity, and Dollhouse).  I would go into more detail; but no description of Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog can do it justice.  You've just got to go watch it and see for yourself.",1243123200,,2848,4.820987654320987

3694235,4,B001M5UDGS,"In classic Joss Whedon style, ""Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog"" tells the story of goofy wannabe supervillain Dr. Horrible (Neil Patrick Harris) and his unrequited love for pure-hearted, altruistic Penny (Felicia Day) who he meets at the laundromat. It is also the story of narcissistic superhero Captain Hammer (Nathan Fillion), Dr. Horrible's nemesis and a massive jerk, who almost by accident earns Penny's affections. We quickly learn that polar-opposites Horrible and Penny are really kindred souls, wounded idealists who feel the world's imperfections too deeply, while Hammer is a self-serving, unfeeling clod willing to step on anyone to get a bit more notoriety. (He is a less-savvy but also less-corrupt cousin of Captain Amazing from ""Mystery Men"".) The unstable triangle between Penny, Horrible, and Hammer leads inexorably to a tragic conclusion -- but there's lots of singing (most of it on-key) and sly humor to enjoy along the way.

Overall, ""Dr. Horrible"" is very nice, a lot of clever fun. The songs in ""Dr. Horrible"" are musically and structurally much like those in the musical ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" episode ""Once More, with Feeling"", which is worth checking out ... if you know enough about Buffy to be able to make sense of them.

A high point for me was the duet between Neil Patrick Harris and Felicia Day in ""My Eyes"", where their musical harmony belies their diametrically opposed views of the world --

Horrible: ""I cannot believe my eyes / How the world's filled with filth and lies / But it's plain to see / Evil inside of me is on the rise""

Penny: ""I cannot believe my eyes / How the world's finally growing wise / And it's plain to see / Rapture inside of me is on the rise""

Well done!",1243036800,2,1722,4.843537414965986
3694236,5,B001M5UDGS,"Joss Whedon fans, get ready to rock!  DR. HORRIBLE'S SING-ALONG BLOG is ROTFLMAO funny.  Campy, corny, and tongue-(firmly)-in-cheek, this ~45 minute web blog will delight Buffy/Angel fans, Firefly fans, super hero/super villain fans, sci-fi fans, musical fans, and pretty much anyone who just likes to have a good time.  DR. HORRIBLE'S SING-ALONG BLOG is completely unexpected and is Joss Whedon at his outlandish best.

Joss Whedon apparently got bored during the 2008 writers strike and conceived this little gem as an ""online mini-series event.""  Neil Patrick Harris is terrific as Dr. Horrible, an arch-villain wanna be who has a video blog about his life goals:  to join the Evil League of Evil and to win the heart of Penny, the girl of his dreams.  NPH is in fabulous voice.  I had the privilege of seeing him sing the lead in RENT a number of years ago; it always amazes me that little Doogie has such pipes!  Nathan Fillion steals the show as the comic superhero, Captain Hammer.  Vain and self-aggrandizing, Fillion plays this roll to a tee.  Felicia Day is sweet and sentimental as the love interest of both.

The singing is outstanding, and the songs, written by Whedon and crew, are engaging, humorous, and toe-tapping.  Perhaps this should have been the all-sing, all-dancing blog...who knows.  The songs are all quite diverse, representing a variety of musical styles.  DR. HORRIBLE'S SING-ALONG BLOG is an off-beat, crazy, rollicking good time.

3694257,5,B001M5UDGS,"Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog is an online comedy video that was cooked up by Firefly creator Joss Whedon during the writer's strike, and it most definitely does not fail to keep the viewer laughing his or her head off.  Starring Nathan Fillion, Neil Patrick Harris, and Felicia Day, it is the story of Dr. Horrible aka Billy (Harris) and his attempts to secure membership in the Evil League of Evil, as well as working up the courage to talk to his laundromat crush, Penny (Day).  He is constantly being thwarted in his efforts by the gorgeous Captain Hammer (Fillion), who utters one of the cheesiest lines in the history of filmed entertainment.

That said, I must warn anyone thinking of buying this DVD: THIS IS NOT FOR KIDS.  Some of the humor is very adult and sophomoric, and I for one do not think that children should be exposed to this kind of humor until they are ready for it.

This edition features slightly altered packaging and will be more widely available.  If you have the original DVD, this one will have nothing that you don't already have.  If you don't have the original, you should feel comfortable getting this edition.

DR. HORRIBLE is easily the most celebrated creation directly for the Internet. GEMINI DIVISION has come out since DR. HORRIBLE and is getting some good reviews in some quarters, but it has garnered nothing like the praise. Repeatedly over the years, Joss Whedon has managed to match or exceed expectations. No wonder that he managed to do so again with this gem. And it easily stands as the most remarkable thing that Neil Patrick Harris has done.

It is nothing short of amazing how much on the cutting edge that either Whedon or his creations have been over the past 15 years. He helped write the screenplay for the first computer animated film, TOY STORY. BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER alone was an epic of ""firsts."" Buffy Summers was close to the first powerful female hero to be found on TV. Xena beat her by a couple of years (though not if you count the BUFFY movie), but Xena seems to have influenced few if any subsequent female heroes, while Buffy seems to inform them all. BUFFY pretty much invented the TV concept of the Body Count, whereby important and notable characters are killed off, completely upturning the prior convention that no recurring characters on a show were to meet untimely deaths). BUFFY was the first series to successfully employ the long narrative arc, building entire seasons around a single story. BUFFY was also the first series to be heavily downloaded on the Internet. This took place because of the decision of the WB to pull two episodes off the schedule after the Columbine High School shootings. The episodes were broadcast in Canada, where some fans made copies of them and uploaded them to the Internet. As a result, ""Earshot"" and ""Graduation, Part 2"" became the first heavily downloaded episodes in the history of television. Also, while BUFFY was not the first series to have a musical episode, ""Once More With Feeling"" was unquestionably the most successful. And while other series came out on DVD prior to BUFFY, it was one of the series to find the pricing ""sweet spot"" of around $40. Prior series like the STAR TREK and X-FILES franchises had been priced to high to generate big sales.

Similarly, FIREFLY anticipated many of the alterations to Sci-fi that BATTLESTAR GALACTICA would wrought. No aliens, low tech, no magic science, hand held cameras, use of zoom on both regular cameras and on CGI ""cameras"" would all be reemployed on BSG.

And BUFFY also became the first TV series to be continued in comic form (ANGEL would follow shortly). Many, many series have continued in noncanonical form, but this was the first series to continue in canonic fashion, with the creator at the helm. Since the advent of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER Season 8 on Darkhorse comics several other TV creators have contemplated continuing their shows as a comic, including Rob Thomas (VERONIC MARS) and Bryan Fuller (the tragically cancelled PUSHING DAISIES).

In other words, it is hardly surprising that Joss Whedon, who has been out in front on so many other projects, would be out in front on exploring just what you could do on the Internet.

That this is good is hardly a surprise given the astonishing quality of ""Once More With Feeling,"" the great musical episode from BUFFY Season 6. This has a far smaller cast, but what there is is outstanding. As I said above, Neil Patrick Harris has never been this good before (and he has on several occasions expressed interest in a sequel, to which I reply, ""Bring it on!""). He sings in a wonderfully unaffected light tenor and manages to express all the nuances of his character. As a blogger who aspires to join the Evil League of Evil (led by Bad Horse -- at the end of the musical we discover that Bad Horse is, indeed, a horse), Harris couldn't be better. Felicia Day, who played one of the potentials in BUFFY Season 7, was unexpectedly delightful as Horrible's love interest Penny. And the always magnificent Nathan Fillion is wonderful in the project's third major character and Horrible's nemesis Captain Hammer. There are also some great cameos by writers who have gone on to other television series, but who made their mark as writers on BUFFY, including David Fury (now a major contributor to 24) and Marti Noxon (now show runner of PRIVATE PRACTICE, formerly show runner of BUFFY in Seasons 6 and 7) as newscasters, and Drew Goddard (currently a writer on LOST, recently the writer of CLOVERFIELD, and director and co-writer with Joss Whedon of the forthcoming film THE CABIN IN THE WOODS) as ""Fake Thomas Jefferson"" of the Evil League of Evil.

As befitting a Joss Whedon creation, this does not end as you think it will. Some object to that. I celebrate it. The ending had far more of an emotional impact on me than I anticipated. Joss Whedon has stated that as a writer it is his job not to always give his viewers what they think they want, but what they actually need. That applies here.

All in all, this is another amazing chapter is a long line of amazing creations by Joss Whedon, wonderfully performed and executed by some great performers.  Whedon has recently signed up with a software company to provide additional direct-to-Internet (and hopefully later to DVD) content along the lines of DR. HORRIBLE.  There has been whispering that there will be a new DR. HORRIBLE story before too long according to Nathan Fillion.  Neil Patrick Harris has expressed interest in doing a sequel.  We can only hope.",1239408000,8,5757,4.771859296482412

I found it while searching for Firefly DVD's and being a fan of Neil Patrick Harris, the Guild, and everything Joss Whedon I had to buy it. Not only is the movie amazing and the singing incredible but the special features are all funny and worth watching. I can't say enough in praise of this DVD it is one of the best purchases I have made recently.

3694268,3,B001M5UDGS,"First off, I have to say that I am one of those ""Whedon Is God"" fanboys.  I used to be a normal person, but Buffy, Angel, and Firefly converted me.  I am of the cult.  And I have bought everything that Whedon has produced, including the comics he's written and that gawdawful Alien movie, plus several books ABOUT him and his art--""The Psychology of Joss Whedon,"" ""Fear and Loathing in Sunnydale""--a lot of LOT OF stuff.

So I'm a full-on Whedon geek.

But lately?  ""Dollhouse"" has not lived up to my expectations, which admittedly were probably unrealistic.

But ""Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog"" was even more disappointing.  Maybe that's because I didn't get into the spirit of the thing.  Treated as a movie, or as an episode of TV show, it's just sort of...cheesy.

Now, as something created specifically for the Interwebs, on a shoestring, during a strike, with actors having a blast?  Sure, it stands as an accomplishment of sorts once all the qualifiers are brought in.  But asked to defend the quality of the art just taken on its own, without qualification, and much as I love Whedon and the creative spirit that went into making ""Horrible,"" I find I don't have much to recommend.

And it pains me to say that.

So for hard-core fans who have to have all of Whedon's output, and are willing to cut him some slack on the strength of his overall genius, of course... of COURSE ...it's a must-have.  But for casual fans or people just seeking high-quality entertainment, don't let this be your introduction to Whedon.  For that, perhaps a good place to start would be ""Serenity,"" the film follow-up to the cancelled TV series ""Firefly.""

Neil Patrick Harris is outstanding as the title character, Dr. Horrible, and his alter-ego Billy.  His is a brilliant performance, ranging from Billy's awkwardness when dealing with the girl of his dreams, Penny (Felicia Day), who he sees at the laundromat, to his ambitious and almost-ruthless Dr. Horrible.

The acting was good, Nathon Fillion was PERFECT in his role, and the entire movie (songs included) overall was made well... hence the three star rating... However, I had a hard time finding a reason to stay awake during this show, it just wasn't interesting.  So, for a bit of a hoot, it was good, but for something really entertaining... meh.... Maybe this was better as an Internet show, perhaps it loses something in the transfer to DVD?  Before I fell asleep I had to explain everything to my husband who wasn't ""in"" on the know of what this show was all about.  I still have to explain to people that no, it isn't a blog, it's a parody of a guy with a blog, with music, and a terribly ill-fated ""evil"" doctor (who really is evil here, anyway?).

And Dr. Horrible, Captain Hammer, and Penny sing about all this.

The basic premise didn't bode well, but the execution made up for everything.  Neil Patrick Harris had a suprisingly good singing voice (started to type 'sinning' voice, and that would have been equally apropos) and could switch from the ambitious but inexperienced Dr. Horrible to his alter ego Billy very smoothly, and created a captivating and likeable (even at his evilist) personna throughout the movie.  Nathan Fillion as Captain Hammer was brilliant; he played the self-absorbed and vacuous hero beautifully.  Felicia Day as Penny was caught in the middle of this and really brought the altruistic and slightly naive character to life.

My only complaint was that it was over too quickly.

My wife and I especially enjoyed the musical episode ""Once More With Feeling"" from Buffy and the gang (both of us still listen to the music on our mp3 players).  So when I heard that Joss had written an online musical, I went searching for it and found ""Dr. Horrible"".  Let me tell you, this is incredibly funny and the music is both well written and hard to forget!  Neil Patrick Harris has an incredible voice, Nathan Fillian hams it up perfectly as Captain Hammer, and Felicia Day is great as Penny.

Besides technical glitches, he battles his love for Penny, a kind-hearted charity organizer, and the machinations of Captain Hammer, a not-so-altruistic hero, en route to joining the top organization of criminals run by someone known only as ""Bad Horse.""

The cast is superb; Neil Patrick Harris should be doing more singing roles. Nathan Fillion is hilarious, and Felicia Day is adorable.

Where this show stands out the most is the writing. Whedon is a great natural lyricist and one of the best ""one liner"" writers you'll ever see. You'll be laughing to yourself hours after viewing this.

Of course, the internet was a perfect vehicle for this show, but I'm sure the DVD will do equally well, if not better. Dr. Horrible's SingAlong Blog came out in the midst of the Hollywood writers' strike last year and filled the void of creativity for TV watchers everywhere, and became a sensation.

The movie's message is never explicitly stated, and is indeed debatable by those with functioning and perceptive minds. The actors are phenomenal---they almost seem born to play their parts.

Delightfully snarky sense of humor. A finale that'll knock you on your a**. AND the BEST last two notes in musical history. It's Joss Whedon at his best and in his element. No wonder it went viral.

So why get the DVD? DUH! Extras! ""Commentary, the Musical"" has as much snark and sass as the main event, and the actual commentary is like CliffsNotes for any aspiring filmmaker who wants to shoot a great film on a shoestring budget. Joss believes in putting art back in the hands of artists. If for no other reason than that, the man deserves your $10. The fact that this is one of the best things he and his crew have ever done (and that Neil Patrick Harris has an unexpectedly fantastic voice) is just bonus hang.

I first saw this online not know what to expect and was surprised.  It draws you in with an interesting concept. Keeps you watching by giving you some entertaining music (which does stand alone).  Finally the story itself begins pick up and keep you watching right through the end.  Since the pacing shifts gears (from concept to music and lastly the story) it may cause some people to lose interest before story really take center stage, however it worth sticking with it.  The main character (dr.horrible) is interesting and endearing.  He hold this world together and ultimate the story.  On the other side, the sterotyped, self righteous, and campy hero (Capt. Hammer) may detract for some.  In fact most of the other character inhabiting this world are on the campy almost 2d characters.

The 2008 writer's strike may have been an impediment to the production of humdrum television series and second-rate movies, but it spurred Whedon and his collaborators to write, produce, and distribute this gem of a musical.  Don't miss the special features, especially the video applications for entry into the Evil League of Evil, which show that there is a new generation of talent ready to fill Joss's shoes, and of course, Commentary: the Musical.  ""Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog"" proves that Whedon's knack for penning hummable songs and black humor can exist outside the context of BTVS, where the success of ""Once More With Feeling"" relied in part on an understanding of long-established characters and story lines.

Neil Patrick Harris and Nathan Fillion are WONDERFUL in this show, and Felicia Day is truly loveable.  The script and story are typical of Joss.  It's funny, sad, thought-provoking, refreshing, disturbing, and a display of many facets of being human, all in one package.  The lyrics to the songs are absolutely ingenious.  My only hesitation in giving this 5 stars is the quality of the music itsself.  On the plus side, the melodies, harmonies, etc. are very good, catchy, and fun to listen to.  The countermelodies are wonderful.  On the down side, the chord progressions were for the most part very predictable and simple.  It started to have a packaged feel.  I wish I could give it 4.75 stars, because that's the only thing that kept Dr. Horrible from being absolutely perfect to someone who is VERY picky about music.  Overall, we loved it and have watched it several times since we got it.  My husband and I even walk around singing and humming the tunes.

  That said, Dr. Horrible's Sing-along Blog is an amazing piece of work.  Neil Patrick Harris(super-villain wannabe), Nathan Fillion(super hero with defects) and Felicia Day(singing damsel in distress) put on an incredible performance that I find difficult to believe was delivered on a shoe-string budget.  I was so wrapped up in the music and comedy that I completely failed to notice that many of the effects are completely cheesey, and now I find that endearing too.

Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog was originally released on the internet in three 15 minute episodes that were available (briefly) for free and then on iTunes.  Why should you shell out eleven bucks for a dvd when you could just get the three episodes on iTunes for a dollar each?  Two reasons.

Reason number one: Commentary! the Musical is one of the bonus features, and is at least as funny as the film itself.  I am convinced it is funnier.  Including Commentary!, you get twice the music and 2.5 times the laughs for one low price.

Number two, you will want to share this with everyone you know, and it's just easier to show people a dvd than to crowd everyone around your computer.  Also, you can loan it to people and guilt them into watching it, or sneak it into your movie night rotation.  These techniques are useful in overcoming many peoples' inexplicable reluctance to watch musicals voluntarily.",1234137600,,1089,4.533333333333333

3694369,5,B001M5UDGS,"Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog is a musical about an aspiring super villain applying for a position in the Evil League of Evil.  One might think this sounds like a childish premise, but Joss Whedon, et al, pull it off.  The music and storyline are alternately extra cheesy and genuinely touching.  It's an emotional stew, indeed, and Neal Patrick Harris is perfect for the role of Dr. Horrible.  He's goofy, but he also honestly wants to be taken seriously as an evil genius.  Better yet, Harris can sing, and he knows when it's right to be cheesy and right to be melodramatic.  But Harris doesn't entirely carry the show.  Nathan Fillion is superb as the superhero Captain Hammer, and Felicia Day is wonderful as Penny, Dr. Horrible's love interest.

The DVD features are great.  You get all episodes of the main feature, plus two commentaries, one of which is a separate musical.  There's the obligatory making of the movie and composing of the music, and there's also a nice collection of Evil League of Evil ""application"" videos made by fans of the show.

Not since Whedon's Firefly series have I seen something so anti-television as Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog.  Even if you haven't liked Whedon's past work, and if you like How I Met Your Mother even remotely, you will love Neal Patrick Harris in this show.  Dr. Horrible is refreshing and intelligent, and it has a kind of reexamination of the imaginative spirit of comic books and musicals.  American culture hasn't forgotten to read its comic books (i.e., the recent Spider-man, X-men, and Batman movies), but we have forgotten the place of the musical (Southpark: The Musical notwithstanding) in our society.

3694408,5,B001M5UDGS,"There is more to Joss Whedon than meets the eye. He likes to distract viewers from the genuine seriousness of his work by a glittering, humorous surface--and by deceptively facetious titles. Buffy the Vampire Slayer, despite the humor of the title and the very funny aspects, was a serious show that dealt with genuine moral issues. One could cite the episode The Body for an example. There have been few more emotionally draining episodes on television.

Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog is the epitome of Whedon's tragedy-hidden-within-comedy method. This is, of course, like all Whedon's work, deeply funny, starting with the opening monologue. Finally we learn the vocal production secrets behind those villainous laughs!

But this is an authentic tragedy. Perhaps we should know by now that just when things seem their sunniest is when Whedon is going to really hit you with the reversal. I'm not going to give away any plot details, because it is a real thrill watching the story unfold. I had the oddest feeling as I watched that this drama really resembles the ancient Greek tragedies with their three main actors, plus a chorus. Greek tragedies were also sung, by the way, though we do not have the music to be able to re-create this element. The basic structure of Dr. Horrible is also consistent with classic Greek tragedy, though in reverse. Typically the hero attempts to achieve some goal but runs up against some limit or flaw. In Dr. Horrible, however, the 'hero' is trying to join the Evil League of Evil. So is Dr. Horrible closer to Attic New Comedy? Perhaps, as the love element is certainly predominant. I can't go into more detail without giving away too much of the plot, so I will take up this review at a later date, perhaps.

One final thought: the delights of discovering the serious sub-text to the comic surface of Dr. Horrible point out the defects in some other recent dramas. Take ""Heroes"" for example. This series creates a ponderous, 'serious' atmosphere to which it is constantly adding with the voice-overs of Mohindar Suresh. Surely there has been no more excruciatingly bad writing since The Architect single-handedly torpedoed The Matrix franchise in Matrix Reloaded. Empty pontificating is the precise opposite of what Whedon does.",1233014400,2,2269,4.981530343007916

It was wonderful to be able to watch it from the comfort of my couch and the 'making of' was really interesting! Having the DVD is really handy when I want to show my not so computer-savvy friends what Dr. Horrible is all about. It's a must buy for fans of the Sing Along Blog.

With all the hype about ""Commentary: The Musical"", I think I got my expectations up a little too much. It was okay and some of the songs are catchy- but it's not really a 'commentary' but more like an excuse to sing more. I'll let you form your own opinions about that, though.

I haven't yet been able to access the hidden Easter eggs, because getting to those requires a very complicated combination of button pushing. I might have to give up in that line of pursuit and find it somewhere on the net, so if you're buying the DVD to see those- it's not a good idea.

Also, if you expect it by a certain date, be prepared to wait several days after the supposed time it's to have been delivered. The estimated delivery date that Amazon gives you will make you too hopeful and you might become disappointed quickly.

All in all, Dr. Horrible is a wonderful, wonderful thing to buy. Great for every occasion, I absolutely love it! I had to give it only four stars however, because I'm so steamed that the Easter eggs were made so difficult to get to.",1232928000,2,1402,4.279245283018868
3694412,3,B001M5UDGS,"I am a huge fan of musicals and also a huge fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  After watching ""Once More With Feeling"" (the BtVS musical episode), I was compelled to watch Dr. Horrible's Sing-a-long Blog on hulu.com.  (I don't have the DVD so I can't comment on extras).

The story is basically a satire on the comic book superhero stereotype, with a few twists thrown in.  I'm not a huge fan of superheros or most comedy, so I wasn't really entertained.  I'm not the person to ask though.

Neil Patrick Harris (Dr. Horrible) and Nathan Fillion (Captain Hammer) were very good.  I expected no less from Harris, who in addition to being an actor, has sung professionally in Sondheim's Sweeney Todd and Assassins.  I was pleasantly surprised by Fillion's singing, as I'm not aware of him having any musical experience.  Fillion stole the show as the swaggering Hammer.  Felicia Day's voice seemed weak and thin to me.

The music and lyrics were decent (worse things have been put on in multi-million dollar Broadway productions), but not as good as ""Once More With Feeling.""  A few songs seemed repetitive.  I would have liked some ensemble numbers, though I realize that was not possible with the scope and funding of the project.

I don't understand all the internet hype about this musical.  It's a decent musical and impressive for the small cast/crew/budget, but I'm who are all these people -- Whedonites?  I suspect that Dr. Horrible is a romp for comic book fans (in the same way The Guild is for MMORPG diehards).  Maybe that's what I'm missing.

I do appreciate Joss Whedon's efforts to bring musicals and small, independent projects to a wider audience.  It's sad but musicals are a dying interest in the US.  Dr. Horrible's Sing-a-long Blog is a good introduction to musicals for the superhero nerd but non-musical nerd in your life.",1232841600,8,1842,4.787301587301587

Instead they took a low quality 480p version of the movie and just ran it off onto some spare blank DVD-R's they had lying around.  You can get a higher quality version of the movie from iTunes than what is included on the DVD.  It is a complete and total rip off.

Penny has a sweet, sweet singing voice and she's torn between Billy (Dr. H) and Captain Hammer.  Capt. Hammer, played by Nathan Fillion, is a riot. I love this show because it has catchy music, it's funny, it's sweet, and has a little romance.  How can you not love a superhero, villain, sweet girl and it's all set to music??

Your question is, I can see this for free, online, why should I pay for the DVD?  My answer is, because I want to see more stuff like this in the future.  I want to support writers that are willing to take a risk and are willing to try a new business model.  I haven't even watched all of the extras on the DVD and already consider the purchase worth it.

The movie itself is hilarious.  I also watched all of the applications for the Evil League of Evil that were included on the DVD.  There were a couple that were really great, and most that were annoying, or lame at best.  We started listening to the musical commentary, but with it being musical, you have to concentrate a bit to really tell what they are saying, and I wasn't in the mood to concentrate.  Lyrics would probably make that part more enjoyable.

To say that Joss is a God of a man would be insufficient; his brothers Jed and Zack are also brilliant, not to mention fellow writer Maurissa. The actors are clearly passionate about their roles and are side spilittingly funny. Neil's talent is so epic that it's a little terrifying. Nathan has that quirky, self assured humour that will have you in stitches and Felicia is a sweet heart one moment and a bottle of insane quirps the next. It's a fantastic ride.

I am not sure how that ended up happening but I do not think that is Joss Whedon's fault. I doubt he is even aware of it happening. But now to the important part..

  It was completely amazing and funny. I loved every minute of it, have had songs and lines from the show stuck in my head all the time since first watching it. I have made other people watch and thus got them hooked on it. I have been a fan of Joss Whedon's from the time Buffy aired. I found Firefly a little late on the game but love that series as well,even more then Buffy.

  The humor in this show is much like the other shows that Joss produces and it's quite entertaining to watch. I will obviously be supporting him as much as possible. Then again I even buy the roleplaying books related to the shows he puts out because I am that kind of nerd.

  I don't think you can lose when Joss and Nathan Fillon are in a room together, and Joss always has a way of picking a group of people that simply fit so well together. I would recommend this to anyone and if you haven't seen Joss's other stuff then I would recommend that too. I am looking forward to the new stuff he puts out.",1232236800,,1307,4.015444015444015

You get the 3 wepisodes (~45 minutes), then you get a musical commentary (which has little to do with what's happening on-screen but is HALARIOUS) which spans the full 45 minutes again.  THEN you get a normal commentary and it's great because you can tell they all had fun making it and are having a great time doing the commentary for it too (once again spans all 3 episodes).  BUT WAIT, there's MORE! You then get a behind the scenes/making of as well as some amusing Evil League of Evil applications from fans (2-3 really good fan videos, a couple not so good, but amusing).

3694455,5,B001M5UDGS,"I'll start out this review by saying that I'm not that familiar with Joss Whedon and his work.

I'll follow up that statement with this:  This DVD makes me want to see more of what he's done.

""Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog"" is fantastic.  I missed this thing when it was a big deal on the internet months ago, but last month I caught it online after hearing non-stop praise for it, and immediately after it finished, I ordered the DVD.

Simply put, its great.  And that's coming from a guy who really really doesn't like musicals.

After hearing that it was a musical about a super hero/villian love triangle I half expected some ridiculous, ultra-campy cult thing like The Rocky Horror Picture Show or that REPO! Genetic Opera thing, but I was very relieved to find this project to be very normal and accessible despite how weird that description makes it all sound.

But I won't waste your time with plot, all you need to know is that its wonderfully acted (the subtle touches in NPHs performance are just brilliant), the songs are very good (again, this is made more significant coming from a man who really doesn't like musicals), and its SO INCREDIBLY FUNNY (""We do the weird stuff!"")!!!  I've seen this 4 times in the last week and every single time through I find myself catching something I missed before.  Most of those times I was playing it for friends and every one of them enjoyed it to the point of laughing out loud as well.  And that includes people from ages 19-52, all busting a gut over this DVD.

Some might not like the ending, but I found myself reacting to it the same way I did to the ending of ""Cloverfield"" meaning that when you take a bit of time to consider what all leads up to it, the ending really makes a lot of sense, and it certainly isn't ""the wrong way to end it"" even if it isn't the finale you were probably expecting.  In fact, I'd say its a great ending.

All in all, its a fantastic DVD, and one that I'm happy to own even if you can see this online for free.  Give it a chance (why not? it IS free online), you'll be pleasantly surprised.",1232150400,,2082,4.371428571428571

I won't repeat all the good points from previous reviews - but we really need more things like this to succeed, which bypass the Hollywood middlemen.  Even though it was available on the web as a free download, it seems worth supporting projects like this financially so people can make them without the content cartels getting their fingers in the pie and messing up the recipe.  Hollywood is afraid of this business model, but I want it to succeed - it puts creative control back in the hands of the people actually doing the work, and also gives them the rewards rather than having an endless series of middlemen glommed on to take their cut.

The DVD, while unaccountably duplicated onto a DVD-R, is chock full of hilarious extras. ""Commentary the Musical"" is one of this discs commentary tracks - sung by the cast! Ingenious! There is also a standard commentary track as well as a featurette on the making of this jewel. There was also the inclusion of fan created video applications to the Evil League of Evil. I must say I was surprised at how good most of them were! They ranged from excellent to quite good.

Harris, Fillion, and Day were superb in their respective roles.  To be honest, I have the entire soundtrack on my iPod and I listen to it daily!!  I even bought copies for four family members for Christmas.

I can't wait to share it with my friends.

UPDATE: 03/24/11

Okay, it's been over 2 years since I first saw this. Some ""changes"" have taken place for me.
I no longer enjoy it...I LOVE it!
I have shared it with every friend I have. I have watched it more times than any other show or movie ever (even Star Wars and Disney's Beauty and The Beast that was on constant play because it was a certain 3-year old's favorite).  When I can't see it, I listen to it.  I have actually purchased this 4 times: first was here on Amazon as the download, then I bought the DVD here as a gift for the above-mentioned 3-yr old who has grown up and loves musicals (he loved Dr. Horrible!), then I couldn't get my own Amazon download transferred to my iPod without some technical stuff that I didn't understand (sci-fi geek, not techie) so I purchased it again from iTunes, then I again came back to Amazon to purchase the DVD again for myself so I could have the special features.  So yes, I own this in 3 different formats, even after I originally saw it online for free.  Even with the 3 versions, I sometimes find myself wanting to watch it when I don't have any of those with me so I have also watched it more than once on hulu (although it doesn't seem to be on hulu anymore) and Netflix.

Dr. Horrible has the irrational exuberance of ""Rent"", mixed with the fantasy of ""Little Shop of Horrors"" washed down with the camp silliness of ""Urinetown: The Musical"". If you have ever heard Steve Martin's version of the Beatle's ""Maxwell's Silver Hammer"" from the 1978 Sgt. Pepper's movie, then you get the idea.

The first of its kind on-line musical is a testament to the magic that can happen when brilliant minds throw off the studio shackles. Neil Patrick Harris plays an endearing wanna-be villain, Dr. Horrible, who blogs about his attempts to be accepted into the Evil League of Evil, and his hopeless crush on the local do-gooder, played by Felicia Day. Both campaigns are consistently thwarted by smarmy super-hero Captain Hammer, (Nathan Fillion)raising universal questions about the nature of good, evil, and public relations. The dialogue is biting (hey, it's Joss Whedon!) and the songs are complex and well-executed. We all knew Neil Patrick Harris had the chops, but Nathan Fillion surprised us with his ability to belt out a show-tune. The disc also includes a singing commentary by the cast, which is clever but more of an inside joke than a real commentary.

A la ""Dark Knight,"" the idea that ""heroes"" are all good and ""villains"" are all bad is turned on its head, and it's obvious that though the means are unconventional, the one working outside of the law can be trying to make society better, while the one loved by the people is doing them no good.

3694475,5,B001M5UDGS,"""Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog"" is in my mind, near perfect. It delivers everything that a good film should (comedy, tragedy, action and great songs) and more importantly in knows when to end.

At just around 45 minutes, it easily could have been padded out and ""whored up"" to make a feature, but director and co-creater Joss Whedon knew that Dr Horrible was just what it needed to be. A great entertaning (something that's hard to achive in Hollywood lately)film with the twist of the ""Bad Guy"" being the hero and the ""Good Guy"" being the villan.

Yes, I will admit that I was one of those people waiting at their computer at midnight as the new Act's were being released, something I've never done before. Mr. Whedon and company should be congratulated for creating this masterpiece that brought the filmmaker and audience together for this brief moment in time.

And to add, as I wrap this up, any film that shows the Producers and Studio's out in L.A. that money and success can be found without their ""help"" deserves all the support we can give.",1231718400,,1051,4.6702702702702705

The acting is superb and the singing even more so.  Harris and Day play off of each other in a way that is simply magnetic.  The songs range from over-the-top hysterical to tear jerking and soulful.  Not bad for what is essentially a comic book brought to life.

The DVD adds to the Horrible experience by including two different commentary tracks (including ""Commentary! The Musical"" -- a commentary track performed as a musical) as well as a great crop of special features.  My favorites were the Evil League of Evil application videos.  Each is a fan-made video application to the League selected by Joss & Co.

The only downside I found was the disk itself seemed a little flimsy.  It plays fine, but the edges show some dark flaking internally.  Interestingly the video box itself does not display the official DVD logo.  I wonder where it was manufactured.

The music is really good, well written, well scored, catchy, covering a lot of styles and sung well (who knew Neil Patrick Harris could sing?) the acting is really good - the characters are deliberately a bit cheesy but the acting itself is smooth and seamless - it's effortless to become part of the world and suspend disbelief, and enjoyable to do so =)

The humor is original and often wonderfully subtle and layered (which is a great combination with the over the top situations and subject material) - support roles were rare but well done.

3694488,5,B001M5UDGS,"Joss Whedon has created another wonderful hit. Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog has just the right amount of evil mixed with just a touch of cheesiness. It's really hard to decide which is more enjoyable. Watching Dr. Horrible, or watching it while listening to Commentary the Musical.

Neil Patrick Harris does a fantastic job as the main character Dr. Evil. He's trying to get into the Evil League of Evil, headed up by Bad Horse. While creating a video blog about it, we find out that he's got a crush on a beautiful girl from the laundry mat Penny, played by Felicia Day from The Guild. We also learn that his arch-nemesis is Capt. Hammer, played by Nathan Fillion from Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Firefly.

If you watched it for free over the internet, or purchased the episodes from iTunes, I would still recommend buying the DVD. It not only includes all three acts, it also has a special commentary track called Commentary the Musical. It's just what it says it is. A commentary track that's a musical in its own right. That alone is worth the price of the DVD.",1231200000,,1068,4.5863874345549736

The humor, the pathos, the music, the intentionally corny acting - they all came together to crack me up, make me sing along, and sometimes make me think a bit. We see the world through the eyes of a would-be comic-book villain who is certainly not as evil at heart as the smarmy Captain Hammer, his nemesis. The songs are very catchy and campy, yet I find myself enjoying some of the musical sophistication in the duets and trios and the occasional chopped-off endings.

I hope that we really do have a Part Four of this.",1231200000,,547,4.47
3694491,4,B001M5UDGS,"I'm a Joss fan from way back, so I knew what to expect going in. Pure unadulterated genius. And largely, I was right. The jokes were dead on, the acting was perfect, and the music was excellent (Nathan Fillion and Felicia Day being somewhat upstaged by Neil Patrick Harris). Dr. Horrible is, all in all, a wonderful work by an exceptionally talented group. I have to admit that I'm disappointed in the ending, if only for its being totally predictably Joss-tastic (inevitably at this point the hordes of Whedonites will descend to explain the brilliance of this ending for me, which I clearly just totally Didn't Get, despite having sat through it in several of Joss's previous projects).

The DVD is great, although the Easter Eggs are infuriatingly obtuse. Commentary the musical is brilliant (very nearly as good as the original DHSAB songs), and some of the underused talent really gets to shine. Also, much of the music is so acerbic as to be borderline corrosive, which is wickedly fun to listen to. The Featurettes, which would otherwise be considered quite solid, are rendered forgettable by the presence of a hilarious spoken commentary. Finally, the ELE auditions are a great deal of fun. I also appreciated the subtitles, although I really wish they'd been made available for the special features as well.

All in all, the project is well worth owning, despite the fact that Joss seems to be a member of the impalement of the month club.",1231200000,,1448,4.834677419354839

I bought the DVD to support the cast and crew, and figured the musical commentary to be some kind of cute gimmick, maybe fun to listen to.

Boy, was I wrong!  It's incredibly funny; tongue in cheek spoken parts, and songs that I believe rival the original songs in the actual video.  I can't get them out of my head any more than I could the originals after I had first saw them.

I do wish the musical commentary focused a bit more on what was happening on the screen, but then again there's an actual commentary for that, also included.

So sure, the original video is available online, and some of you won't buy the DVD for that reason.  But if you liked the songs, the musical commentary alone is worth double this price.  Excellent stuff!",1231113600,,982,4.3812154696132595

Commentary: The Musical! is a good reason to buy it, as is the wonderful ""Making of.""  But most importantly, you should buy this DVD to prove that Dr. Horrible and webseries are here to stay!

3694497,5,B001M5UDGS,"Yes, the movie is available online, but the DVD offers so much more. The musical commentary is a stitch, as it explores various musical styles and doesn't take itself seriously in the least. You'll catch yourself humming the tunes, to both the show itself and the commentary.

The disc also includes other talented citizen applications to the Evil League of Evil. There's a lot of talent out there.

If you are new to Dr. Horrible, you need to keep in mind that it's the story of the birth of a super-villain. Some viewers have taken issue with the ending, but it is appropriate considering the whole story. After all, achieving what we desire comes at a price. The ""greater"" the dream, the greater the price.

Also, be sure to watch the credits for clues to the Easter eggs that the producers have tucked into the DVD. Watch the credits to the very end for something that doesn't look ""normal."" I think we'll be playing with this DVD for a while to figure out just how many treasures wait inside.",1231027200,,997,4.558659217877095
3694498,4,B001M5UDGS,"Yes, I was sceptical. About the commentary musical that sounded like a cool but gimmicky thing, essentially something where the idea is better than the actual result. Most people said the music in the commentary is at least as good or even better. Couldn't really believe that. Fine, so I was wrong. Except for two or three songs that didn't do much for me, most of them are surprisingly good and catchy.

(For simplicities sake I stick with their role names)
Moist gets to sing and Groupie #2 gets a solo (so does #3 in the end). Actually the first surprise of the commentary track. That voice was so good I forgot to finish thinking ""What? Who cares about groupie #2?""

Just as amazing as hearing Felicia Day singing in her own voice. Penny always had a hint of thinness while Felicia herself has a great voice.

The regular commentary and features isn't bad either. It has the usual behind the scenes info. Nothing extraordinary here, but still worth watching.

The DVD itself is where the scepticism should have went. Lucky me seems to have received a pressed DVD and yet I wasn't happy with it until I tried all three drives. After putting it in my PS3 my neighbour starting drilling a hole in some wall at low speed. Wait. I think that sound is coming from.. uhm.. is a DVD supposed to sound like that? Tried the DVD drive/CD burner in my PC with the same result. When the disc is spinning it's causing a very disturbing and loud noise. Not the whining kind of spinning at high speed, but the low and humming kind that makes you wonder if you will have to fiddle out bits and pieces out of the player any moment now. The third drive (DVD burner) finally played it quietly.

Closer look at the disc. While all may other DVDs have a perfectly smooth edge (the silver layer, not the plastic) this one is looking like a mountain ridge. A really jagged one. In fact, it even seems to be slightly bent (more than my comparison DVD). Somewhat disappointing that it makes your average magazine DVD look like high quality and it could explain the annoying sound.

The content easily gets 5 stars and would get more, but there seem to be a lot of minor and not so minor issues with the DVD itself. So maybe one should consider burning a copy of the DVD and using that. Though these days it's more likely someone will rip the image to their media server.

Should you be getting this? Well, obviously not if you don't care about all the extras and just want to see what everybody is talking about. It's out there for free in more places than I can count and it's even perfectly legal on top of it. Get this if you either want to own it, hear the coolest commentary track or simply want to thank/support the extended Whedon bunch.",1230940800,9,2723,4.42315369261477
3694499,5,B001M5UDGS,"For the first few minutes, I wasn't sure exactly what I was getting myself into.  Then the first song starts to play, and NPH follows through like a champ with his amazing vocals.  I remember seeing him do a song from RENT on Conan over a decade ago, and he's improved much since those days.
The laughs don't stop coming, and the performances from the entire cast is outstanding.  I even have a hard time trying to figure out which song I like the most!
Fans of Joss Whedon have probably already stepped on board.  Whedon's got a knack for not just interesting storytelling, but also has a spectacular grasp on changing the tone of a story from one mood to the next.  He does the same here.

You will be singing the songs for the next few weeks, discovering new cleaver twists and nods in the lyrics days later (the lyric ""head up Billy buddy"" appears in two different songs, one referencing the other), and some of the truly inspired complex rhymes are just delightful.

It doesn't take long before you start rooting for the would-be villain Billy in his quest to impress both Penny (his laundry mat crush) and Bad Horse (The Thoroughbred of Sin), the equine head of The Evil League of Evil.  The acting is solid all the way around, but Harris truly steals the show.

While the story is extra cheesy in Whedon style, the musical numbers are really first rate!  I never realized Neil Patrick Harris was such a wonderful musical performer.  Felicia's numbers were moving and memorable.  And Nathan's were perfect for him and his character: bigger than life and cheesier than Velveeta...

But what I was surprised about was the special feature ""Commentary! The Musical.""  The songs on the commentary were almost better than the DVD's!  Some of the ""jokes"" are insider jokes that only the truest Whedon fans will enjoy, but I think most will find the songs overall funny.

I am soooo in love with Nathan Fillian's song ""Better Than Neil"".  It is so hilarious and the kind of song that is so catchy it should be on the radio.  I laughed and truly enjoyed all the rest of the songs!  The ""groupies"" definitely deserved their own solos as their voices are wonderful!  Neil Patrick Harris again blew me away... he has come a long, long way from Doogie Howser!

On the top of the page, it says that the disc format is DVD, but if you buy it, there is a possibility that they will send you a burned DVD-R instead of a pressed DVD disc. This can be an issue because DVD-Rs are not as durable over time and some DVD players cannot read them.

You can tell if you received a DVD-R if it is a purple backed DVD-R disc.

The musical numbers are wonderful, and Harris, Fillion, and Day are spectacular as well.  The only real flaw of Dr. Horrible is that it has to come to an end, and while the ending itself may be flawed, it is however fitting to Whedon and co.'s overall blueprint.  The DVD extras are surprisingly plentiful and worth the price of admission alone, and needless to say that whether or not you've seen this online or missed out on it like I did, if you're a Whedon fan then Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog is an essential pick-up that you will enjoy again and again.",1230508800,,1391,4.699588477366255
3694514,5,B001M5UDGS,"So I love this movie/short. the star of this dvd is the ""Commentary! The music."" A commentary track that is all new music about the commentary. It is by far the best commentary since the power puff girls commentary from the characters.",1230422400,,235,4.619047619047619
3694515,5,B001M5UDGS,"Now, for someone who almost missed the horrible boat, I am happy that JINX saved me.  I got the newsletter, which came to me on the day Act 3 was released, and wondered what this Dr. Horrible thing was all about.  I went to the web site, and saw the three acts online, and watched them, when they were up for free.  I loved the songs, I loved the story.  I watched all three acts, and became close to obsessed.  I started telling friends to watch, promoting the featurette.  So, when I heard a DVD was coming, I had to get it, and placed my pre-order.  On a further note, let me break it down by parts:

The Featurette Itself

The actual Dr. Horrible's Sing-A-Long Blog is excellent.  The story is funny, the sets are cool, especially since it was done in some guy's house, made up by Monster House.  The songs are clever, funny, catchy, and addicting.  I thought that every actor in it was perfect for their part.  Felicia plays Penny extraordinarily, NPH IS Dr. JHorrible, and Hate was PERFECT for Captain Hammer.  Joss Whedon should take great pride in this project, and be more than satisfied with the finished product.  I can only hope that things half this good come next.

Commentary! The Musical

This was an original diea, which really caught my attention.  I watched the whole thing, not knowing what to expect.  Doing a musical commentary, about a musical, is creative, and great.  Also, it really allows a talent showcase, for those who may have been overlooked.  Stacy's ""Ten Dollar Solo"" is a great song, which really shows taht she has a great singing voice.  Zach's song, ""Zach's Flavor,"" is also awesome.  I enjoyed this extra as much as the original featurette, and think this alone was worth buying the DVD.  By the way, ""Ninja Ropes,"" is hilarious.

Filmmaker's Commentary

I usually have zero interest in hearing what the actors and writers have to say.  I made an exception, and was glad I did.  I enjoyed listening to them talk through the entire thing, and loved hearing their take on the different scenes.  Hearing all the stories, about when they were filming the scenes was hilarious, especially knowing that they did the Bad Horse chorus a few dozen times.  It shows that Nate is a good sport, considering they had him harnessed to the van for half a day.  Also, finding out this was almost done, by the Whedon's, and Maurissa, on a webcam, was an interesting piece of information.  Again, this was another worthwhile quality of the DVD.

ELE Applications

The very first application aws great, and the Zombie Princess, and puppet priest, were also great.  The others really didn't make me laugh, or hold my attention too much.  It actually disappointed me, and made me feel like I shoudl have sent in my own, and I would have, had I had the video equipment to do it.  It is still a worthwhile feature, and I congratulate those who did have their videos shown.

Final Thoughts

I definitely hope to see more of NPH, in projects like this, as I think that he fits in well.  I admit, despite her being engaged, I think, that I am officially in love with Felicia.  I'm even her friend on Facebook.  Ha-ha.  Anyway, I really do believe that every single person, who worked to make this project a reality, deserve nothing but the highest of praise.  I thank Joss Whedon for his hard work, and dedication to the business, showing that not everyone in Hollywood is just in it for the money.  So, with all of that said, I hope that anyone, who was not quite convinced to buy the DVD is now, and that you will buy it.  It is more than worth every penny, and is a very important part of my 1,000+ DVD collection.",1230422400,3,3630,4.515384615384615
3694516,1,B001M5UDGS,"Sorry, but I did not get this.  I am a fan of Firefly and Serenity, but this I do not get.  The music is bad, the story is silly, the singing is comparable to Mamma Mia (and that is not a compliment), and most of the jokes miss the mark.  Nathan Fillion has his moments, great actor that he is, but nothing can save this exercise in wannabe camp.  Watching this made me realize how hard it is to create ""camp"".  Rocky Horror Picture Show was not an accident and neither was High School Musical.  Creating camp takes a lot of work.  You may not know you're creating it, but you will know it's hard work.  This on the other hand doesn't look like it took much work.  If it did, sorry.",1230336000,18,682,4.106060606060606
3694517,5,B001M5UDGS,loved it! who couldn't love the whole idea of a likable bad guy? and the smarmy good guy? Joss Whedon did it again...all I ask is when will the next installment come out???,1230336000,,172,4.242424242424242
3694518,5,B001M5UDGS,"Not only is this completely awesome in a way that will define awesomeness for generations to come (only a small exaggeration) but it is a huge step in finding a way to circumvent the studios. That's why it's so important that Dr. Horrible makes money, enough money to make people pay attention. Because this will prove what Joss Whedon and other writers have been saying all along: We don't need the studios. All they do is interfere with creativity, take money from the real creative minds of the writers, and try futilely to stop pirates. Joss is (hopefully) about to prove that he can make a simi-high-budget film, put it up on the internet free for a week, and STILL make money.
I am an amateur filmmaker. I hope one day to be able to make a high-budget film, put it on the internet, and make enough money to keep making them till I'm old, tired, and fat. But amateur filmmakers like me can't do that if the studios control everything, if independent films keep getting swept under the metaphorical carpet as they are now. The studios have all the control right now, which is why there is such a lack of creativity in American movies today, half of which are just sequels or remakes. I say they had their chance, and now it's time to move on.
Getting a copy of the DVD isn't just about supporting everyone who worked on this project, it's about proving something. Proving that we don't need greedy middle-men who interfere with creativity. Proving that we won't wait for the next writers strike before we see the need for change. Because that's what this is really about; it's about change, and our ability to change the industry for the better. It's time the writers got back control of what they've written. Just imagine, if Dr. Horrible succeeds, and is followed by other successful independent films, there won't be a need for a writers strike ever again.",1230336000,,1863,4.614457831325301
3694519,5,B001M5UDGS,"Fabulous bit of work, and this DVD is worth the asking price just for ""Commentary! The musical."" It doubles the awesomeness of Dr. Horrible all by itself, and the spoken commentary is nice too.",1230249600,2,193,4.705882352941177
3694520,5,B001M5UDGS,"The characters are great, the music is even better and the story is a lot of fun. This started out as webisodes, but I'm so glad they made it available on DVD.",1230249600,,159,4.0
3694521,1,B001M5UDGS,"I haven't been able to watch the movie yet. It arrived, surprisingly as a ""home-burned"" (purple read surface) DVD disc. The disc also had a scratch on it out of the box, but I don't know if it won't load or play because of the scratch, or the ""burned"" nature of the disc. The ""home-made"" burned style disc is disappointing. There are places that REPLICATE DVDs in the same method as movies at the store. I have used these services and they cost about $1-2 a disc in quantities over 1000. Replicated (silver, ""store-type"") DVDs have the highest compatibility.

Amazon does have the DVD-R note at the bottom of the product description. I received it as a gift, and am requesting a replacement through Amazon. Amazon made it easy to print a return mailing label.

I look forward to seeing the movie.",1230249600,42,796,4.598591549295775
3694522,5,B001M5UDGS,"As with many Joss Whedon ventures, this is quirky and fun in all the right places. Who would have thought you could turn the bad guy, the erstwhile Dr. Horrible, and make him into the protagonist, while making the traditional good guy, Captain Hammer, into the antagonist. In Dr. Horrible, you find yourself rooting more for Dr. Horrible than you might normally for a villain in anything. Dr. Horrible is very likable, and just wants to join the ELE; the Evil League of Evil, and won't settle for anything less {and certainly not the Henchman's Union that his friend Moist is part of}.

Part of the brilliance of 'Dr. Horrible's Sing-A-Long Blog' is in the casting. Neil Patrick Harris is hilarious and appropriately cynical as Dr. Horrible. He brings a certain something to the character; a kind of jaded determination that lends itself well to the humour in the piece. Nathan Fillion shines as the shallow superhero Captain Hammer, who seems to take a perverse pleasure in bothering Dr. Horrible, finding different ways to make his life miserable. One of the ways he does this is stealing the girl, Penny, who Dr. Horrible has a maybe-not-so-unrequited love for. Penny, played by Felicia Day, is different from the girl you would expect to normally find in this role. She has a girl-next-door quality to her, which allows you to like her and she is a genuinely good person, who wants to help other people, and has no idea, like most women in superhero ventures, that her friend Billy is really Dr. Horrible. We are shown that even though she is dating Captain Hammer, that she may not really like him. And, judging from the way he acts through the piece, we can't blame her.

'Dr. Horrible' is broken into three acts, all of which are executed quite well. Whedon brings a sense of reality to his creation; sometimes things don't always go according to plan, sometimes people do die who you don't want to, sometimes the bad guy will win {even if you like the bad guy}. All of these things are part of life. One thing about Whedon, is that he doesn't necessarily let all of his characters have happy endings. And while I'm not a giant fan of that, I have to acknowledge and respect him for drifting from the norm with that concept.

The fact that this is a musical brings another element to the mix. Most musicals are flights of fancy, and can have a tendency to go on for too long with the ""spur of the moment"" segments of people bursting into songs on their daily routines. There are a few songs that shine out through the soundtrack; 'I Cannot Believe My Eyes', 'Brand New Day', 'So They Say', 'Slipping' and 'Everything You Ever'. These bring a complexity to the story and show different aspects of the characters that we might have otherwise missed.",1230249600,,2754,4.639344262295082
3694523,3,B001M5UDGS,"The actual material was awesome, but I wish there was more on it. The ELE submissions varied between being jaw dropping awesome, and just terrible (in a bad way), as in I couldn't figure out why they were chosen for this DVD. My main gripe is that my DVD doesn't work most of the time, and I JUST opened it yesterday. The first viewing, and it skips, freezes, the sound doesn't come on in certain parts...and the DVD itself is just terrible. A brand new DVD shouldn't skip, freeze, and lack sound in parts all together during the first viewing. Is it just my copy that does this, or are all of them poorly made in this way? If it's just mine, how do I get a replacement?",1230249600,9,670,4.2421875
3694524,5,B001M5UDGS,"There was one good thing to come out of the Evil Unholy Writers' Strike of 2007-2008. With eternity in their hands, Joss Whedon and cohorts were able to write and produce the supremely awesome DR. HORRIBLE'S SING-ALONG BLOG, which was streamed online in a series of three webisodes during July 2008. First time around, there were so many hits on the site that the server crashed. If you're Joss Whedon (and cohorts), that's a mighty good thing.

""For every day, there is a night. For every world, there is an underworld. And for every hero, there's... this guy."" As may be discerned from the teaser trailer's voiceover, Bill a.k.a. Dr. Horrible doesn't have a lot of supervillain street cred. But, as indicated by his video blogs and his responses to all those snarky e-mails, he's a hopeful mad scientist, a man with a plan. Dr. Horrible has got two things on his plate (well, three, if you count his fine-tuning of his evil laugh - dude's got a voice coach, even). He feels fairly good about his most recent application to the Evil League of Evil. And he's only weeks away now from mustering the nerve to actually chat up his laundromat crush, the pure and beauteous Penny. That is, if things don't get ruined by that narcissistic superhero Captain Hammer (or as Dr. Horrible puts it: ""Captain Hammer, corporate tool!""). Because, lately, not only is Captain Hammer foiling Dr. Horrible's schemes, but now he's also wooing (the pure and beauteous) Penny.

I never do this, brother, but as soon as I got done watching this one, I immediately went and saw it again. DR. HORRIBLE'S SING-ALONG BLOG is a hilarious supervillain send-up that features a sweet love story at its core. As well as plenty of very nice singing. If, like me, you Joss Whedon fans were hankering for more shows like Buffy's classic musical episode ""Once More With Feeling,"" this bunch of webisodes is as good as it gets. Just be prepared for that lousy thing which Joss Whedon does at times.

In case you don't already know, these collected webisodes only add up to 42 minutes, so factor this in before you buy this DVD and then bellyache about the meager running time. Joss Whedon directs the thing, and co-writes the wittily-turned story and the terrific songs. I don't think I've ever seen Neil Patrick Harris so endearing, as the hapless supervillain in love, or Nathan Fillion so wonderfully, purposely cheesy and over-the-top as the self-serving Captain Hammer. Personally, I had no idea that ol' Doogie Howser can carry a tune, but dude is great and sings my favorite tune here, ""My Freeze Ray."" Also very key to the story is Felicia Day's performance as the sweet and innocent Penny. Day happens to rock that doe-eyed Claire Forlani look, and, after this, I'm intrigued enough by her that I mean to look up her online web-series The Guild. Buffy fans may recognize her as Vi, one of the potential Slayers (or not, she didn't really have a big part in Buffy).

Word is that the cast & crew worked for nothing to get DR. HORRIBLE done; the hope is that the DVD release will make enough profit to compensate everyone. The prospects seem to be bright. Anyway, the bonus features are damn spiffy: ""Commentary! The Musical"" is the very cool, innovative, and kinda insane cast & crew commentary done up in song (keep an ear out for ""Ten Dollar Solo,"" Nathan Fillion's ""I'm Better Than Neil,"" Zach Whedon's funky rap and ""Nobody Wants To Be Moist""); also, the more typical commentary track by Neil Patrick Harris, Nathan Fillion, Felicia Day, Josh, Zack, & Jed Whedon, and co-writer Maurissa Tancharoen; three featurettes comprising the Making Of stuff: ""The Movie"" (7:51 minutes), ""The Music"" (7:22 minutes) & ""What Just Happened?"" (5:27 minutes, concerning the cult popularity and public fallout of the Dr. Horrible webisodes); the ten Evil League of Evil application videos submitted by fans (30:45 minutes, with standout entries from Mr. Terrible, Princess Zombie, the Reverend, and Movie Monkey); and the teaser trailer that was initially released on the [...]

There are no subtitles for the Commentary! musical which makes it impossible to understand some parts with no lips to watch, let alone deaf peeps.  You can't flip to a single ELE application and the menu flipping is a bit sticky (a common Joss Whedon DVD issue).

1) The order... Amazon is burning these as orders come in, which is cost effective and FAST.  Two-Day shipping applies to Prime members.

2) The DVD... The box has a very professional looking cover with spine and rear box art.... The only thing I noticed was the cover was a tiny bit fuzzy, probably from a lower printing resolution than normal DVD releases.

The disc looks AMAZING.  I pulled it out, and was surprised to see the disc has a printed image ON THE DISC.  This is very professional looking, and is quite impressive when you see it in person.

3) The content... It all starts with an impressive animated menu system that makes the film feel like a Hollywood picture.  Very slick looking.  The special features are amazing, including a 20 minute documentary about the making of the film, Commentary! (a commentary track with ALL new music with a behind the scenes feel), and all sorts of other fun little Easter eggs and surprises.

This DVD is a wonderful creation.  In my mind, it is totally worth the 10 dollars it costs, and once I received this disc, and seeing what a professional cool experience it is, I wish I had paid more for it.

Here's what I learned - multiple viewings really help you enjoy Dr. Horrible all that much more.  The nuances of the performances are much nore enhanced the more you watch it (really, watch Captain Hammer's face when he sings about 'just might sleep with the same girl twice' and his reaction to the background singers who pop in).

Ditto with the music.  At first, I found it to be slightly throw-away, but you know what?  It works.  Yeah, NPH's voice is stronger and better trained than Nathan Fillon or Felicia Day's, but they all work - especially the harmonizing.

I've become a big fan of ""Brand New Day"", ""My Eyes"" and especially ""So They Say"".  They constantly play in my head - for better or worse.

In whatever format, for some light hearted fun, I think folks should check it out.  Most folks still don't know Fillon and Day, and MPH hasn't been Doogie for a long long long time.

I love all the songs. They get stuck in your head the same way ""Once More With Feeling"" did. They are wonderfully done. My fianc&eacute; criticizes Nathan Fillion's voice, but I think he did a fine job. However, Neil Patrick Harris is the true standout of awesome talent. He did a great job on this project.

The use of video blogging as a setup for the plot is genius, and I was actually kind of sad when Act 3 featured no blogging whatsoever. On a side-note, I think the sequel should definitely be titled ""Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Podcast.""

My one gripe with this product has been mentioned by others: why a DVD-R? I know the limited shelf-life of DVD-Rs has been exaggerated, but still! Why not have a professionally made DVD that will last longer? I have seen a ton of low-budget stuff make it's way to DVD. Hell, ""My Name is Bruce"" is getting a blu-ray release! ""Dr. Horrible"" would be an awesome blu-ray! This complaint is not enough to get me to avoid buying this, but I am certainly disappointed with the quality of the product. Here's hoping for a future double-dip with some kind of deluxe edition.",1229472000,22,1345,4.526748971193416

3694547,5,B001M5UDGS,"DR. HORRIBLE is easily the most celebrated creation directly for the Internet.  GEMINI DIVISION has come out since DR. HORRIBLE and is getting some good reviews in some quarters, but it has garnered nothing like the praise.  Repeatedly over the years, Joss Whedon has managed to match or exceed expectations.  No wonder that he managed to do so again with this gem.  And it easily stands as the most remarkable thing that Neil Patrick Harris has done.

It is nothing short of amazing how much on the cutting edge that either Whedon or his creations have been over the past 15 years.  He helped write the screenplay for the first computer animated film, TOY STORY.  BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER alone was an epic of ""firsts.""  Buffy Summers was close to the first powerful female hero to be found on TV.  Xena beat her by a couple of years (though not if you count the BUFFY movie), but Xena seems to have influenced few if any subsequent female heroes, while Buffy seems to inform them all.  BUFFY pretty much invented the TV concept of the Body Count, whereby important and notable characters are killed off, completely upturning the prior convention that no recurring characters on a show were to meet untimely deaths).  BUFFY was the first series to successfully employ the long narrative arc, building entire seasons around a single story.  BUFFY was also the first series to be heavily downloaded on the Internet.  This took place because of the decision of the WB to pull two episodes off the schedule after the Columbine High School shootings.  The episodes were broadcast in Canada, where some fans made copies of them and uploaded them to the Internet.  As a result, ""Earshot"" and ""Graduation, Part 2"" became the first heavily downloaded episodes in the history of television.  Also, while BUFFY was not the first series to have a musical episode, ""Once More With Feeling"" was unquestionably the most successful.  And while other series came out on DVD prior to BUFFY, it was one of the series to find the pricing ""sweet spot"" of around $40.  Prior series like the STAR TREK and X-FILES franchises had been priced to high to generate big sales.

Similarly, FIREFLY anticipated many of the alterations to Sci-fi that BATTLESTAR GALACTICA would wrought.  No aliens, low tech, no magic science, hand held cameras, use of zoom on both regular cameras and on CGI ""cameras"" would all be reemployed on BSG.

And BUFFY also became the first TV series to be continued in comic form (ANGEL would follow shortly).  Many, many series have continued in noncanonical form, but this was the first series to continue in canonic fashion, with the creator at the helm.  Since the advent of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER Season 8 on Darkhorse comics several other TV creators have contemplated continuing their shows as a comic, including Rob Thomas (VERONIC MARS) and Bryan Fuller (the tragically cancelled PUSHING DAISIES).

In other words, it is hardly surprising that Joss Whedon, who has been out in front on so many other projects, would be out in front on exploring just what you could do on the Internet.

That this is good is hardly a surprise given the astonishing quality of ""Once More With Feeling,"" the great musical episode from BUFFY Season 6.  This has a far smaller cast, but what there is is outstanding.  As I said above, Neil Patrick Harris has never been this good before (and he has on several occasions expressed interest in a sequel, to which I reply, ""Bring it on!"").  He sings in a wonderfully unaffected light tenor and manages to express all the nuances of his character.  As a blogger who aspires to join the Evil League of Evil (led by Bad Horse -- at the end of the musical we discover that Bad Horse is, indeed, a horse), Harris couldn't be better.  Felicia Day, who played one of the potentials in BUFFY Season 7, was unexpectedly delightful as Horrible's love interest Penny.  And the always magnificent Nathan Fillion is wonderful in the project's third major character and Horrible's nemesis Captain Hammer.  There are also some great cameos by writers who have gone on to other television series, but who made their mark as writers on BUFFY, including David Fury (now a major contributor to 24) and Marti Noxon (now show runner of PRIVATE PRACTICE, formerly show runner of BUFFY in Seasons 6 and 7) as newscasters, and Drew Goddard (currently a writer on LOST, recently the writer of CLOVERFIELD, and director and co-writer with Joss Whedon of the forthcoming film THE CABIN IN THE WOODS) as ""Fake Thomas Jefferson"" of the Evil League of Evil.

As befitting a Joss Whedon creation, this does not end as you think it will.  Some object to that.  I celebrate it.  The ending had far more of an emotional impact on me than I anticipated.  Joss Whedon has stated that as a writer it is his job not to always give his viewers what they think they want, but what they actually need.  That applies here.

All in all, this is another amazing chapter is a long line of amazing creations by Joss Whedon, wonderfully performed and executed by some great performers.",1229212800,9,5072,4.7465753424657535

Edit: I honestly must have been ill to leave such a short (if enthusiastic) review. Dr. Horrible is so much more than that. In a relatively short timespan - I believe the entire thing is around 47 minutes - Our three main characters draw us into a different world, and flesh it and themselves out enough to empathize with the villain, root for the heroine, and loathe the previously adored Nathan Fillion (Mal Reynolds FTW). It was brilliantly cast. I had no idea that NPH was on Broadway but apparently the man can do anything, and Day and Fillion turned in surprisingly strong performances despite little or no background in musicals.

Beyond that, I have to give Whedon and crew some serious props. The soundtrack is surprisingly addictive and worth the buy. Granted, not all of the tracks are stand out, but there are at least three that make you do a double take and hit the repeat button at least once or twice. The music is fairly simple, but carried out in a masterful manner, and the lyrics are rich and compelling within the context of the drama.

This is definitely worth a buy, and the soundtrack, too. Now if that sequel could just happen......",1229040000,,1404,4.653225806451613
3694550,5,B001M5UDGS,"""Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog"" was the best, and laugh out loud funny, direct to web production I have ever seen. We have been waiting for the DVD release as my wife and I must have watched this over a dozen or so time times on the web before they took it down.

We follow the somewhat evil Dr. Horrible in his quest to join the Evil League of Evil and impress ""Bad Horse"" (The Thoroughbred of Sin) by pulling off a truly evil crime. His efforts are complicated by a love interest (a do gooder no less), and the insensitive Captain Hammer.

The blogging and singing are perfectly integrated into the story, and many of the songs really stick in your head.

Joss Whedon's vision paid off in the following the ""movie"" has gained, but the real credit goes to the outstanding production and perfect performances from Neil Patrick Harris, Felicia Day, and Nathan Fillion.

  Dr. Horrible's Sing along blog was created by Joss Whedon during the writers strike on a relatively low budget and at a hectic pace.  Despite that, it gained enormous popularity on the web--through old fashioned word of mouth (No glitzy milion dollar ad campaign here...no sir.)

  Like many of my fellow reviewers, I heard alot of buzz about this from friends, my brother, online gamers..and initially saw it on hulutv.

Neil Patrick Harris is amazing as the title villain--I can't imagine any other actor who would bring to life Dr. Horrible with such glee.  Felicia Day was perfect as Penny and I became such a fan that it led me to her own little web show--the Guild.  This DVD a must see for you and for everyone on your christmas list.

3694567,5,B001M5UDGS,"I just ordered my DVD but my original thoughts were blogged on July 18, and they still stand; well, of course:

Whether you are or aren't an acolyte of Joss Whedon, do yourself a favor and view this 45-minute serial TV show made for the Internet (and now on DVD).

This was an experiment devised by Whedon, two of his brothers, a writer friend of theirs, and countless others who contributed, during the fairly recent (now months ago) WGA strike.  The artists on this project basically worked for free, with Joss Whedon and a few others ponying up the funds.

Dr. Horrible is the tale of a mad scientist (Neil Patrick Harris), would-be villain who wants with his entire being to be part of the Evil League of Evil, run by an Uber-Villain Overlord named Bad Horse.  Why?  He's in love with a girl named Penny, who he's afraid to talk to but wants to rule the world with.  She in turn falls for a big lug with half a brain called Captain Hammer.  Hammer and Dr. H have a hate-hate relationship, mostly because Hammer keeps giving him beatings and messing up his plans for world domination.

Did I mention it's a musical?  The whole thing is brilliantly devised; archetypes of villains and heroes turned on their head, a sweet young thing who is their innocent catalyst for change, and a tuneful score which harks to musical theatre influences ... some Bernstein, some  Schwartz, with emphasis on Sondheim.  Whedon and his co-writers obviously love language and know how to use it to warp the woof of an oft-told tale; good vs. evil.  But just who is good and who is evil?  And for whom will you weep when the story is through?

Write and tell me.  I'd like to know what you thought.

On the surface, looking at photos, reading synopses here and there, you might be fooled that this is just a trifle, a silly confection.  Those unfamiliar with Whedon's previous artistic outings are in for a surprise.  The ending is being hotly debated even as I write this.  There's a lot for everyone here; musical enthusiasts to comic-book fans, to dramaturgs.

Watch how well the tone shifts from Act to Act, with the music supporting all the action.  Act I is the honeymoon, Act II the divorce, and Act III ""the great black pit"" in more ways than one.

Neil Patrick Harris is a star - if that wasn't already clear.  His singing and acting runs the gamut from sweetly hopeful, to sarcastic, to morose, to black outrage and despair.  If Act III doesn't prove that you can become hollowed out through your own mistaken desires, nothing will.

Nathan Fillion plays the ""Hero,"" Captain Hammer.  I don't want to give too much away if you haven't seen it yet, but let's just say his performance is the perfect capital P for pompous.  I'm not surprised he delivers on the singing - a very talented man who is not afraid to spoof his own image as someone who is adored, but in a totally obnoxious way.  He's equal parts lecherous Judge Turpin from Sweeney Todd and Judd Frye from Oklahoma.  Not easy to pull off.

Felicia Day (who has her own show The Guild on the Internet Highway) plays Penny, the innocent ingenue who tries to stay positive in a wicked, bad world.  Tries to make a difference despite indifference.  Day is competent, sweet and smart in a role that doesn't give her much to do.  It felt as though she really had to pull back her own personality to make it fit within the confines of a role that doesn't change or grow.  But she is there for a definite purpose.

How we could be taken on this journey in such a short series. I'm a believer that all things are possible. Especially when there's Whedons involved.",1228348800,44,3606,4.50231124807396

A behind the scenes look of life from a want-to-be-supervillian, this story gives you a natural feel.  Dr Horrible's (Neil Patrick Harris) video blogs helps set the tone.  His clumsy behavior makes him realistic and believable and not so evil. While Captain Hammer's (Nathan Fillion) ego reinforces that life is more than just black and white. Felicia Day is the lovely Penny who inspires Dr Horrible, and inspires Captain Hammer with another way to dig at Dr Horrible.

I'll update this review once I get the DVD to talk about the extra features, but for now I'll simply talk about the 42 minutes of wonderfulness that is Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog.

Update: This DVD has the best extra features I've ever seen! They are simply spectacular. The musical commentary is ridiculously funny and the songs are just as catchy as in the actual thing. I can't believe they took the time to give us another 42 minutes of excellence. It's astounding. Also, all the other extra features are cool. It's fun to learn about how they made the music and the show and everything. The creators and actors are all interesting. But one more thing puts these extra features into the upper echelon. There are hidden features! There are puzzles scattered throughout the DVD(one of the easy ones is that some credits have yellow letters that spell out an action) that, when you decipher them, tell you to perform certain actions at certain times. When you do, you get to see tidbits of bonus content. The DVD is like an extra musical and a game all in one!

This stand-alone story tells the tale of a sort of sub-par supervillain and his attempt to enter the Evil League of Evil. The supervillain, Dr. Horrible, lives a mostly normal life when he's not being villainous. In fact, he even has a crush on a girl he always sees at the laundromat, Penny. Unfortunately, Dr. Horrible's nemesis, the just and righteous Captain Hammer also has ""feelings"" for Penny. And the whole thing is filled with spectacular songs! The songs are catchy and amazing, the acting is superb, the story is both hilarious and touching, and to think that all this was done during the writer's strike by a few talented people and with their own funds.

So if you think that watching a supervillain/hero love triangle musical sounds like an amazing experience, this is for you. It's filled with parody and wit, some of the jokes are spectacular, and the entire thing is memorable. If you're like me, you'll find yourself watching this over and over, showing it to everyone you know, and reveling in the fact that you can't get the songs out of your head.

Other things:

1. You can watch this for free on hulu.com, but there are advertisements. I bet that if you see it there, you'll like it enough to buy the DVD.
2. This format is something extremely innovative and interesting. By buying this DVD and supporting Joss Whedon's new idea and format, perhaps more of these creative endeavors can come into existence. This is sort of a trial, and it's up to us to show that a short, small-budget, well-acted, well-written piece of work is worthwhile. Plus, Joss funded the entire thing himself, and I think of it as a sort of shareware. Buying this DVD is my way of saying ""Thank you. I do in fact want to own this. Great Work.""
3. One reviewer complains that the DVD is a DVD-R, which is a little sketchy. This is only because the whole production value was in the low hundreds of thousands of dollars, perhaps not even 200k. The people behind this wonderful work are doing their best to provide us with something great, and this DVD will be just that, great, no matter the format.
4. Finally, I have nothing to do with Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog, other than that I am a rabid fan. My plug for the DVD is entirely based on how creative and worthwhile it is, so I hope everyone buys it and enjoys!",1228262400,14,3478,4.576243980738362
3694586,5,B001M5UDGS,"I heard of ""Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog,"" and wanted to see it, but didn't think I'd get the chance to; I don't watch many shows on the Internet, and a three-part Internet only ""series""...well, that was just out of my league.  Fortunately, I got the chance.  And it was as hilarious as I expected.

Dr. Horrible (Harris) wants to join the Evil League of Evil...the only problem is, he's essentially a geek with a bunch of gadgets, who has a crush on Penny (Day), but is too shy to talk to her.  Plus, he's up against Captain Hammer (Fillion), a jerk in a suit who has taken it upon himself to woo Penny by becoming the ""Sheriff of Poverty"" and helping her establish a homeless shelter.  All of this combines to force Dr. Horrible to plan something that is so horrible, it overflows with its horribleness...

I discovered Joss Whedon via ""Serenity,"" which led me to ""Firefly,"" which then made me a huge fan of Nathan Fillion.  (That's right: I'm not a cult follower of Whedon's, which I like to think makes me an unbiased reviewer here.)  So, without having seen everything Whedon's done, I can't say this is the funniest bit of cinema in his catalogue; but it's certainly the funniest thing I've seen, from anyone, recently.  It's pitch-perfect humor: We sympathize with the villain and hate the hero, and it's all to great comedic effect.  Neil Patrick Harris is hilarious; Nathan Fillion is so subtle, it makes you wonder why he hasn't become a comedy film star; and Felicia Day is just so darned loveable, we hate the fact that she loves Hammer, and yearn for her to get with Dr. Horrible.  The singing isn't perfect, but it doesn't have to be; it's hilarious, and that's all that matters.

I guess ""Dr. Horrible"" is a bit of a pet project for Whedon and these actors; well, that's absolutely astounding, considering Hollywood rarely puts out something this amusing.  Kudos to the entire crew, and I pray they get their money back with the DVD release.

3694602,5,B001M5UDGS,"I'm sure everyone is raving over this one of a kind musical blog, as they should be. It is great in every way.
I am here to say that even if you have bought it on itunes, or watched it free online you should definitely not think twice about picking this dvd up.
For one, I hear that they recorded a whole musical commentary to go along with it, which is suppose to be great.
Also, This was made very cheaply, Many people didn't get paid, including the special effects team that worked on Buffy. They did this for free in hopes one day they would be repaid for their efforts.",1228176000,2,574,4.18018018018018

3694604,5,B001M5UDGS,"Dr. Horrible is one of the most clever scits created.  It's funny, the songs are catchy, and the cast is top-notch.  If you don't like it, the problem is with you, not Dr. Horrible.",1228089600,2,181,4.294117647058823
3694605,5,B001M5UDGS,"This is one of the most fun and enjoyable videos of the year. The songs are memorable and have you singing to yourself for days. For a low budget shoot the quality is top notch and the acting is superior from Neil, Felicia, and Nathan. I recommend that everyone watch this video.",1228089600,2,279,4.384615384615385
3694606,5,B001M5UDGS,"Fantastic, humor and sarcasm to boot. The dvd is going to be filled with special tryouts of the internets! While most of my friends call it indulent and childish I say it is brilliant and sardonic! Just get it already!",1228089600,,218,4.475

3694608,5,B001M5UDGS,"Conceived during the latest Writer's strike, Joss and company wrote (and in some cases, starred in) this instant classic (TAKE THAT, DISNEY!).  It is #2 on my all-time favorites list...#1 being The Princess Bride (inconceivable, I know).  I was privileged to be in Hollywood on Halloween to see the first charity screening.  Joss, Nathan and Felicia commented on just recording some of the dialog for the commentary.  I have no doubt the commentary is every bit as good as the musical itself.  If not, may the Bad Horse make me his mare!

Ed. note:  watched (listened to) the commentary.  While it's not as good as the actual movie, it was enjoyable for what it was...a shameless plug to get us all to buy the DVD...er, a masterful commentary on Felicia Day's ""process"".",1228003200,3,770,4.78030303030303
3694609,5,B001M5UDGS,"This is a no brainer.  Super heroes, super villans, super singing, soup even, this has it all.  Action, adventure, laughs, love and tears are a few of my favorite things... ok ok buy it you know you want to.",1228003200,,207,4.282051282051282
3694610,5,B001M5UDGS,"I was quite excited when I heard about the concept of this; I will be honest and say that I really wanted to watch it because I'm a big fan of both NPH and Joss Whedan. I heard about the small budget (of course) and wanted to see what could be done with it; it was excellent.

Naturally, since the four episodes totaled less than half an hour and the entire dvd spans about one hundred minutes, I have to think that the rest of the dvd is full of nothing but awesome. A commentary sing-along? That is unheard of and, most likely, incredible.

I'd like to know more about the on-demand dvd-r aspect, though. Will it have the durability of commercial dvd-rs sold for home consumption or will the dvd-rs be better?",1227916800,2,711,4.338345864661654
3694611,5,B001M5UDGS,"I'm not sorry to say that i waited until midnight every day that one of the installments of Dr. Horrible came out.  I was completely rewarded for my efforts.  It may be shorter then an hour, but theirs enough laughs and pure Joss amazingness to fill it's own TV series.",1227916800,2,269,4.36
3694631,5,B001M5UDGS,"""Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog"" tells an incredible story of an aspiring villain... who blogs and sings. In this backwards world, the villain is the hero, and the hero is the villain. But which one will get the girl? If you're a fan of ""Sweeney Todd,"" you'll love this movie. The acting is impeccable, and the music is flawless. Not a scene, not a song, not a word is out of place. This is a story you won't want to miss.

The fact that this DVD has two commentaries -- a typical filmmaker's commentary and, appropriately so, a musical commentary -- is unique in and of itself. The fact that it's the same stellar crew that put together the Sing-Along blog itself guarantees brilliance. The other special features, such as the ""making of"" videos, are horribly satisfying. I fell in love with the project all over again.",1227916800,128,820,4.616438356164384
3694632,5,B001M5UDGS,"Joss Whedon has done it again with Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog.  Fantastic story, great music, infectious fun.  It's practically impossible to stop yourself from humming or singing the songs from this musical tour de force.  If it was possible to give more than 5 stars, this would be the perfect candidate.  Thanks Joss and Team Joss for brining us more great memories.",1227916800,4,373,4.873015873015873
3694633,5,B001M5UDGS,"I was fortunate enough to have a fellow Whedon fan forward me to Dr. Horrible's Sing-A-Long blog in the short week it was initially available for free. Soon after, I bought digital downloads. Soon after that, I bought the soundtrack. It mirrored my obsession of Buffy The Vampire Slayer's episode ""Once More With Feeling""; the songs get stuck in my head for days, and I never mind them being there.

You'd think that I wouldn't need this DVD since I already have access to its content in several different mediums. Think again.

This DVD also contains ""Commentary! The Musical!"" featuring additional musical content as voice over commentary, with more music than the actual set of webisodes themselves! This is in addition to a standard commentary with the writers and stars, and making-of content.

This is a must have for fans of the Whedon family, fans of Neil Patrick Harris, and fans of good musicals.",1227830400,13,906,4.87012987012987
3694634,5,B001M5UDGS,"So it's nothing short of a miracle that I ran into this webcast musical. I'd never dipped in the pond of Whedon's work and at the time I wasn't a fan of any of the actors, but boy did that change.

I first heard about Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog from a couple weekly podcasts that I listened to and everyone loved it, so I gave it a try. I came out of the experience singing the catchy songs for weeks, seeking out the actors' works, and wanting to be a bigger Whedon fan.

The acting is spectacular. Neil Patrick Harris is one of the best actors of his generation and he shows real and refined talent by both singing and acting as Dr. Horrible himself. It's a shame that Nathan Fillion, Captain Hammer, is not an exploding star. Felica Day, too, exhibits fine acting and singing skills and it's hard not to fall in love with her character, Penny.

The Whedon team (+ Mo) do an amazing job of weaving together fine acting, extremely catchy and well-written songs, and witty, yet thought-provoking dialogue in the tragicomedy that is Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog and I, for one, cannot wait for more.",1227830400,248,1104,4.455445544554456
3694635,5,B001M5UDGS,"Like so many others I watched this show on the internet .. then downloaded it from iTunes ... then purchased the soundtrack and then patiently waited for it to come out on DvD, so you can be sure I will be preordering it immediately.
This is a must see-don't miss out DvD. Even if you don't like musicals, give this a chance because it is not your ""typical"" musical. The acting is fantastic, the story line engaging and the songs very catchy (you WILL find yourself singing many of them days after you have viewed it). This will be worth every penny you pay for it and will be a DvD you will watch over and over and over again.",1227830400,8,627,4.233333333333333
3694636,5,B001M5UDGS,"This is a DVD of Doctor Horrible's Sing-along blog. A fun little musical that hit the internet in the Summer of 2008.  The story revolves around the anti-hero Dr. Horrible (played by Neil Patrick Harris) and his Nemesis, the 'Good' Captain Hammer (played by Nathan Fillion). Both end up vying for the same woman (Felicia Day) while Dr. Horrible tries to gain entry into the Evil League of Evil.  Assorted henchmen appear periodically to align Dr. Horrible's goals and to sing some catchy little tunes.

I have not yet seen the DVD but am pre-ordering it. I did see the video as it was released on the Internet. I am purchasing the DVD for the extra things being put into it.  Joss Whedon is known for the extra content in his DVD releases and I am sure this is no exception. The story about how the making of this Internet released musical would also be worth it.

A contest was posted on the Evil League of Evil website stating that 10 fan based videos would be placed in the DVD.  Over 1000 applications to the Evil League of Evil entries were posted. I am interested in the outcome.",1227830400,9,1085,4.454545454545454

Neil Patrick and the whole cast are perfect, and the entire production is highly original in content, format, and artistry.

I hate musicals. I know, I know. But it's true. Somehow Joss captures my attention and makes me laugh so hard I forget that I hate musicals when I watch Dr. Horrible. I'm already hoping for a sequel.
