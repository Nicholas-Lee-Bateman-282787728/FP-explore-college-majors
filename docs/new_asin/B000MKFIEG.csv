8169665,5,B000MKFIEG,"This documentary is one of the best I have ever seen.  It presents the history of the Holocaust Museum, and details some of the agonizing decisions about what exhibits to include, and what to exclude, and why.  It also shows some fascinating details about museum preservation methods.  It personalizes events which are rapidly fading from memory, and clarifies our need to remember so that we do not repeat.  I used this video for years in my English classroom, but despite annual searches, have never been able to find it on DVD.  It would be a shame for this unique story of how a museum comes into being to be lost.....I wish that TEACHING TOLERANCE or some similar organization would spearhead its conversion to DVD and arrange for its use in a developed teaching unit made available to high schools. I have watched it many many times, and always am fascinated.  If you can possibly obtain a copy, it is well worth it.",1291507200,,922,4.660493827160494
