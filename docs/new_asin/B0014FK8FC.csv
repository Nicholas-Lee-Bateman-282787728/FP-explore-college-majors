8255656,1,B0014FK8FC,"Honest, it seemed a good idea at the time.  ""Grindhouse"" style old low-grade exploitation flicks from my youth.  But these are mostly Asian-made complete tripe.  Not trashy, mind you -- in the raunchy sexy sense -- just crumby.

Reproduction quality of some is awful, sound of some is awful, subtitles are unreadable on many, and story is nonexistant on all.  As for titillation, forget it.  They're simply awful.

You've been advised. (wink)",1378512000,3,442,5.055555555555555

8255658,3,B0014FK8FC,"What we have here is a grab bag of 10 random films from Videoasia somewhat spuriously grouped together under a horror theme as part of their GRINDHOUSE EXPERIENCE line. I figured it'd be helpful if I noted actual titles and run times for anyone curious about this set, which is a repackage of their five TALES OF VOODOO double features. There's a rough parity between actual horror films and action films hiding behind bloodthirsty titles. In any case, you can make your own judgments as to the entertainment value of each entry ...

Disc 1, side A:

HELLHOLE - onscreen title: ESCAPE FROM HELL HOLE 1:41:56

JUNGLE VIRGIN FORCE - 1:33:08

Disc 1, side B:

GHOST NINJA - onscreen title: DIAMOND NINJA FORCE 1:28:46

PRIMITIVES - onscreen title: SAVAGE TERROR 1:26:27

Disc 2, side A:

A DOG CALLED VENGEANCE - onscreen title: VENGEANCE 1:45:58

SCORPION THUNDERBOLT - 1:25:49

Disc 2, side B:

TEMPLE OF HELL - onscreen title: ARK OF THE SUN GOD 1:38:11

CANNIBAL CURSE - onscreen title: CURSE 1:25:02 Has fuzzy burnt in subtitles that were cut off the bottom of the screen on my old TV, but fine on my computer.

Disc 3:

THE RAPIST - 1:29:09 Has crisp burnt in subtitles.

DEVIL'S EXPRESS - onscreen title: THE DEVIL 1:26:01

As far as image quality goes, it's the usual Videoasia shuffle: a bunch of old tapes duped straight over to DVD. I've shared a gallery of title screens for each film above, hopefully that gives you an idea of what you're getting. Primitives and A Dog Called Vengeance are especially beat up, with frequent tape rolling and fuzz. Jungle Virgin Force has a strange widescreen matting that leaves the image with uneven letterboxing. Temple of Hell and The Rapist probably look the best out of all the films in the pack.",1355097600,11,1744,4.6875
8255659,1,B0014FK8FC,"No stars. I did not buy this from Amazon.  Seriously, this collection is not worth one dollar.  The video transfer is terrible.  Sequences are completely dark and unwatchable.

So far, stick with at least the first series in the Cult Classic Drive In collection.  I got one of those for less than ten dollars and so far it has been much more enjoyable than this collection.

If anyone here gives this a good recommendation, the person must be a sales person for the company.",1265328000,8,474,4.583333333333333
8255660,2,B0014FK8FC,"When I'm writing this review Amazon has not yet posted a listing for the titles for the set. I've been looking around the internet for some clue as to what titles are included in this set it appears that seven of the titles are as follows:

Jungle Virgin Force (Awful film about a lost tribe in the jungle)
Hell Hole (Women are kidnapped to serve as sex slaves for mercenaries. A perfect example of a real grindhouse film. Its not bad, not great, but not bad)
Ghost Ninja (Godfrey Ho cut and paste job of new and old footage-its one of the worst films ever made-and not in a good way)
Temple of Hell (Good, but mindless adventure film ala Indiana Jones)
Cannibal Curse (Fair black magic film with midgets)
Dog Called Vengeance (Very good existential tale of a political prisoner on the run)
Scorpion Thunderbolt (More Godfrey Ho cut and paste about a killer snakeman)

Which means its Video Asia has once again repackaged their Tales of Voodoo discs under another name (there are five double features released separately and together- If this is the case the missing films would then be Devil's Express a Chinese Horror Film thats a gory black magic tale, The Rapist another Chinese film about the hunt for the title character which is nasty and uninteresting, and the Primitives which is another Jungle film about a lost tribe. It starts out okay and then goes down hill)

If this is the case the films are a very mixed bag. Some have subtitles burned into the film,some are oddly letterboxed, many are worn and all are no doubt from VHS tape copies. The films are a mixed bag (see above for one line reviews) and are for the most part something to rent rather than own. Having picked up every other Grindhouse Experience set I would say this is the worst of the lot simply because the number of poorer films is so high (all of the other sets in the series are worth purchasing if you know the sets limitations). If you do pick this up do it as cheaply as possible.

(If I am in error and the titles I describe here are not the titles in this set, please disregard the review.)",1210982400,27,2078,4.4605263157894735
