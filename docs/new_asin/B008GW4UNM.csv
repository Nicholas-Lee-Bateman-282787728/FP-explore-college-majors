8527697,5,B008GW4UNM,"I recommend this entire set be made available at all churches, schools and libraries. Those who can, should offer continual opportunties to meet and discuss the content of this set of books. Volume 2 stands alone so any reader might read this volume without starting at Volume 1 and it digs deeper into issues that currently or soon will affect all Americans. We need to know and understand and this volume provides an amazing understanding of the enemy among us.",1412380800,,463,4.8

A must see for all citizens! Be sure and review online course. Pick all 4 DVDs not complete in one volume.
