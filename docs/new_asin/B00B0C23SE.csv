5540181,4,B00B0C23SE,"NOTE: I received a free copy of this DVD to review for the web site Metapsychology Online Reviews.  Please see that web site for a more detailed version of my review.

Tara Lee is a London-based yoga instructor who has created the Elements of Yoga series. ""Earth Foundations,"" the first video in this series, is designed to be accessible to all levels and to focus on the Earth element via grounding postures. For all the practices on this DVD, Lee is outdoors by a river teaching via voiceover. Her only prop is a mat (with the orientation frequently changing from parallel to the viewer to perpendicular due to shifting camera views), although occasionally an inset is shown with modification options. Lee sometimes notes the names of the postures in English, sometimes in Sanskrit, sometimes not at all.

The Main Menu of the DVD offers the following options: Introduction--Play All--Practice 1 (22 mins)--Practice 2 (20 mins)--Practice 3 (21 mins)--Savasana (5 mins)--Bonus Features--Music Options. Music Options includes choices for ""Music & Instruction"" and ""Music Only,"" but no option for ""Instruction Only"" (a.k.a. a ""Music Off"" option). The individual practices work as stand-alone sequences, but they can also be combined together for a full routine of just over an hour. I have provided detailed information on each practice below.

PRACTICE 1
For this first routine, Lee begins with a long (about 5  minutes) sequence of seated breath practice, including extending the breath, breath retention, and setting intention (sankalpa). She then moves into several additional minutes of simple seated stretches. Coming to hands and knees, Lee continues to perform gentle stretches such as child's pose, modified cobra, child's pose variations, bird-dog, and hip circles. From an upright kneeling position, she moves through gate pose and reverse gate pose on both sides, then concludes the floor work with more hip circles and downward dog. Lee finishes this practice in standing forward bend.

PRACTICE 2
The second practice is more active, and it includes various vinyasa flows. Starting standing, Lee comes to the toes for a stretch left and right. Next, she moves into a chair/forward bend vinyasa. From here she transitions into a modified sun salutation, then returns to the chair/forward bend sequence. The next vinyasa is a flow between plank and downward facing dog which is repeated several times. This is followed by a following warrior 1 series. Lee performs pigeon and seated twist on each side, and then she returns to standing for goddess pose with heel lifts and a shoulder stretch. The final posture is tree pose, and then Lee concludes this routine with gentle spinning and deep breathing.

PRACTICE 3
This final routine centers mainly around flowing standing postures followed by some floor poses to finish. Lee starts standing in mountain pose and then moves through a vinyasa to a standing pose series which includes warrior 1, warrior 2, and triangle pose, repeating on the second side. She goes through this exact same sequence a total of three times on both sides. Coming to lying face down, she performs locust, sphinx, child's pose, and rabbit. This is followed by staff pose and full seated forward bend. Next, Lee cues legs-up-the-wall pose, but she herself performs the posture with her legs perpendicular in the air (unsupported). However, her instructions assume use of a wall, which I think would be confusing to those unfamiliar with this pose and/or new to yoga. Finishing postures include fish and a short (1 minute) savasana, and then Lee concludes the practice in a seated position.

Selecting Bonus Features off the Main Menu brings up a submenu which offers the same options on all three Elements of Yoga DVDs. In addition to three short yoga practices, the bonus submenu includes a Q & A with Lee (11 mins) and Credits. The routines are as follows:

Earth--Balances (9 mins)
Air and Water--Breathing (10 mins)
Fire--Core (Advanced) (11 mins)

In general, Lee did a nice job with this DVD, combining mostly solid instruction (although not mirrored cuing) with basic yoga practices. However, I found the routines to be somewhat repetitive and Lee's cuing to be a bit uneven--e.g., she often seemed to spend less time on the second side than on the first. Furthermore, although Lee states in her Introduction that ""Earth Foundations"" is intended for all levels (and most of the postures are at a beginner level), Lee does not provide enough instruction for those brand-new to yoga. Therefore, I would recommended the Elements of Yoga series to experienced beginners and beyond only.",1374624000,47,4623,5.119363395225464
5540182,5,B00B0C23SE,"Great for beginners or those who want to do more advanced yoga.  I always feel wonderful and grounded after doing this DVD.  I do the whole hour and sometimes add one of the bonus/extra segments added on to the DVD. She does use some yoga terminology, so total beginners may have to do a little web research if they want to know what she is referring to.  I have all Tara Lee's DVDs and love them all!",1374451200,5,401,4.181818181818182
5540183,5,B00B0C23SE,"Wow! I'd never heard of Tara Lee until I read about her on an online fitness forum. I saw a clip online and bought I bought her three Elements of Yoga DVDs: Earth Foundation, Air and Water Flow, and Fire Dynamic. I'm a high-intermediate yoga practitioner and a fan of Travis Elliot, Eoin Finn, Rodney Yee, Erich Schiffman, Colleen Saidman, Tamal Dodge, Barbara Benagh, among others. I'd rank Tara among the best of these. Her voice is soothing and her cuing is great. She talks just enough - not too much. Each of the DVDs is divided into three approximately 20-25 minute segments (one in Fire is about 35 minutes). You can do the whole thing in one flowing session or each as a stand alone practice. Tara has some unique variations on some traditional yoga postures. The settings are gorgeous and the production is very well done. Nice supportive music. I'm so glad I found these. Tara is an undiscovered gem! She is now one of my favorites.",1366675200,41,942,4.579881656804734
5540184,5,B00B0C23SE,"This is a very relaxing type of yoga but just because it's not a killer workout, don't think it's a waste of time.  In fact, I found myself coming back to it in the evening, after work, realizing how much more peaceful I felt after doing it in the morning.  I do just one 20 minute segment at a time and always get the same results, just feeling so much more centered than I did before I started.  Tara is very pleasant and there is a segment in the DVD where she explains how she got into yoga and a little bit about her philosophy, if you'd like to know more about her.  I also love the music and beautiful outdoor setting!",1366675200,13,625,4.098360655737705
5540185,5,B00B0C23SE,I am fairly new to yoga.  I recently started doing this DVD and it contains several of the same movements I do in physical therapy for back pain.  I know this DVD will be part of my regular exercise for a very long time.  Great instruction too!,1366502400,9,244,4.148936170212766
5540186,5,B00B0C23SE,"I bought this beginners DVD, and her other DVD Flow Yoga for Air & Water.  I no longer have time to go to the gym or a yoga studio, but I really need to get my yoga practice in during the week to keep me calm and get a good workout.  This DVD is perfect for beginners like me.  The routine is challenging but not overwhelming, and I can see why it is called foundational yoga.  Tara has an excellent style of teaching and a really soothing voice.  She does not rush you through the poses, and I feel as though she is in the room with me!  The scenery is amazing.  I just loved it!",1364428800,22,580,3.9482758620689653
5540187,5,B00B0C23SE,"I am a beginner and this DVD is perfect!  Tara is a good instructor.  It is paced really well and you are challenged, but not overwhelmed.  The DVD has 3 main 20 minute practices, and you can do them individually, or play the entire for a full 60 minute work out.  In addition, there are several bonus features: 10-minute balancing series, 10-minute core workout, 10-minute breathing exercise, and a 5-minute relaxation bonus section.  It is filmed in a stunning location which makes it interesting to watch.  I have never practiced a DVD based on a theme like the earth element and it really added to the routines.  Tara was good at explaining the link between the pose, the earth and how to incorporate that into you like to help ground you.  It is 90 minutes long so I feel it is very good value for your money.",1364083200,57,814,4.489795918367347
5540188,3,B00B0C23SE,"I bought this DVD on Amazon UK.
It is very good, with clear instructions and clear filming. The instructor's voice is pleasant, calm and clear.
However, the movements are way too difficult for most beginners. Unless you're naturally flexible, with healthy knees and general fitness, this DVD may not be for you.
The title is 'Beginners Yoga and Beyond' - well, I think it's more 'beyond' than beginners. It would be good for someone who has already taken a beginner class and who wants to progress to intermediate level.
If your body doesn't have the natural flexibility needed to follow this programme, if you're past forty, if you have arthritic joints or knee problems, or if you simply want to start easy, I recommend the DVD 'Yoga For The Rest Of Us' by Peggy Cappy.",1483228800,,771,4.718518518518518

5540193,5,B00B0C23SE,I bought this for a teenager who suffers from anxiety.  She has had it for only a few weeks and now practices yoga every day.  She has lost weight and feels so much better emotionally.  I also gave her a diffuser and lavender oil for aromatherapy to use while doing the yoga. I would definitely recommend this video!,1473984000,4,316,4.413793103448276
5540194,5,B00B0C23SE,Love this DVD! Tara's voice is wonderful and makes me feel peaceful and grounded. I'm still on the first practice but it is going well for me! I love the earth connection!,1471392000,,171,4.375

I have also recommended her to family and they all agree! Great for beginners but still challenging for those who are more advanced.",1462147200,2,301,4.69811320754717
5540199,3,B00B0C23SE,"This is NOT a Beginner's Yoga DVD.  There is NO instruction, NONE.  It is a good DVD or program if you know what you are doing, but I have a little experience and this went so fast.  Yes it is separated into three levels, but the first level is practically noting but meditation and no instruction and then it proceeds quickly to very advanced poses in the second stage without any instruction.  Very disappointed and the other reviewers must have had a lot more experience to say this is a good place to start.  It is not.",1459468800,4,523,4.350515463917525

5540201,3,B00B0C23SE,"This is most definitely NOT a beginners yoga DVD. Very nice surroundings and I love the music, however, I feel very rushed through the poses and on to the next one before I've managed the first one. If you've got yoga terminology and poses down, then it's probably wonderful. Will look for an introductory yoga DVD and maybe come back to this one.",1455148800,6,347,4.523809523809524

5540204,5,B00B0C23SE,"I am the most inflexible person alive, and I HATE yoga. But my muscles get very tight and a health care professional recommended I get into yoga. I have tried a number of ""beginners yoga"" videos and they did not change my hate for it. Then I found this video. This is a wonderful beginners yoga video, and I actually almost enjoyed it. I doubt I will ever love yoga, but with this video I can at least enjoy it.",1452643200,3,411,4.15
5540205,4,B00B0C23SE,"This tape has three workouts, but they really are one hour long workout, best done as a sequence.  I don't think that one could do each one separately without warmup.  Good instructor.",1451520000,,184,4.71875
5540206,5,B00B0C23SE,Great Yoga DVD. The DVD was for me but my Mother loves it so much that she turned out to be the better Yogi and does it daily. Tara has a soothing voice and the setting is beautiful. The practice is a great one.,1451088000,,211,3.8181818181818183
5540207,5,B00B0C23SE,I bought her second video first as it was highly recommended.  I would recommend that you buy them in order as it will be easier on your body.  This is the first in a series of three and Tara is an amazing teacher.  Perfectly paced... calming voice... easy to follow.  Now that is not to say the poses are easy... but you will learn in time.  So happy with this series and plan to buy the third as well as others she may have.,1444953600,3,426,4.023809523809524
5540208,5,B00B0C23SE,"Great for beginners or for those (like myself) getting back into yoga. I liked yoga before, but the classes I attended were all about the poses and less about the foundation, energies, and getting to know your body. Tara Lee has made me fall in love with yoga! I have found myself doing at least one practice a day, sometime two, or all. I feel so much more at peace and in tune with my body, as well as more strong and confident. I can't do the poses perfectly, but she reminds you that's okay! It challenged me, but didn't discourage me when I was slower or less flexible than Tara. I can't wait to order the other DVDs in this series.",1442620800,,637,4.229508196721311
5540209,5,B00B0C23SE,Absolutely love this dvd! The best way I have found to relieve stress related back and shoulder pain.,1442275200,,101,4.666666666666667
5540210,5,B00B0C23SE,I wish I could train with her in London!  Outstanding for beginners or someone looking to dip their toes into the world of yoga as well as seasoned experts.  Excellent break down into 3 sections that you can build on or do separately.,1441238400,,234,4.4186046511627906
5540211,5,B00B0C23SE,"This is my first Tara Lee Yoga DVD and I love it! Very soothing, clear instructions and interesting routines. Great  to practice after a long stressful day. I think it will be become a favourite together with my usual Rodney Yee programmes.",1439337600,,240,4.714285714285714

5540213,5,B00B0C23SE,"I'm 54 and focused on cardio workouts since I was 15 years old.  While technically I am fit, I was NOT flexible.

All those years of compacting my muscles instead of lengthening them real affected my balance.  I've been using this DVD for 2 weeks. I felt like an idiot the first time I tried lesson one but after 2 weeks, 5x a week I notice a significant improvement in my posture, balance and flexibility.  I combine it with my old cardio workout for a better me!

Amazing!",1438473600,11,474,4.340909090909091

5540220,4,B00B0C23SE,"This is a great beginner yoga DVD. I am no yoga expert, but I do find this DVD ""easy"". However, it's a great one to do when I have the time and need to wind-down. I enjoy having the breathing exercises woven into the moves and Tara's voice is so soothing. :) The DVD has 3 distinct sections that can be done in succession or played on their own.

Would recommend if you are just getting into yoga and want to try something new, or if you like to incorporate something a little lower-impact into your workout routine.",1425254400,,516,4.26530612244898

5540228,3,B00B0C23SE,"This is my first yoga dvd, and I really enjoy Tara's soothing voice and low British instructions.  My only negative opinion is that she gets into poses much more quickly than my lumbering body can slip into them. The 1st exercise is truly beginner based, but not really long enough to get a good rhythm going. The 2nd and 3rd exercises leap way out of the beginners range. So I hope to get better, but for now I'm stuck. There isn't much explaining for slow learners like me for what the poses mean. I guess it would be great to have a long beginners only dvd with her voice and talent, where she takes just a bit more time to explain the how to for those of us who have never done yoga before and don't want the competition often seen in gym classes.",1420588800,6,751,4.215277777777778

5540231,5,B00B0C23SE,"Omg.....got this for Christmas from my hubby...LOVE it!!!!!!
 Very slow, very fluid movements, this is real yoga, not this fast paced hold the posture for 3 seconds crap.
I did the first two workouts and whoa, I was incredibly relaxed. She has a beautiful English accent, has a soothing demeanor about her, and encourages you to just go at your own pace or do what you can. I am a denise Austin fan when I work out and this is a nice change in pace for me, there are definitely some poses I'm not great at but if I get to where I can't  do it I just do one similar so I don't get out of sync with the mood. It's very mind peaceful and I wish I had this dvd years ago. This will not break a sweat, didn't for me, it's not too lose weight, it's just to help your mind, your balance, great for posture, stretching, there are definitely some poses that work the muscles but nothing I couldn't handle and didn't get sore. I have never done yoga like this and I love it. You won't be sorry if you want real yoga. It's for beginners or intermediate but the dvd says novices can do it too to. I would consider my self intermediate and was very fulfilled.
Do not buy if you want a face paced weight loss deal, this is something you may want to do after a workout or in between workout days.
I would buy this again in a heartbeat, gorgeous settings too and the music is very soothing too, even my hubby said ""what is that in there, I like it?!""",1420070400,4,1434,4.099644128113879

I was worried she would use  the same basic techniques as her other, and I would be bored, but she doesn't!  It is much different from Flow.  I like that the workout is broken into three main portions, or can be played together.  There are nice special features. Most of all, I like it because she focuses on challenging, breathing, and the flow without overwhelming.  She goes slow enough and explains well enough that I don't have to stare at the screen the whole time and worry I am doing things wrong.  She has a well rounded knowledge, and shares it with you.  She has a calming voice as well, and that is always nice to help relax you in the middle of an Iso hold that is straining you.  I am looking forward to getting her Fire DVD for Christmas!",1414022400,,846,4.211180124223603

5540245,5,B00B0C23SE,"Very relaxing, and some challenging points",1405900800,,42,6.166666666666667
5540246,3,B00B0C23SE,I was really hoping for a more of a beginners Yoga DVD.  I'm very new to Yoga and need a true beginner's DVD.  This was a bit more than I could do but will continue working on my Yoga.  I've not been able to find a truly beginner's Yoga DVD; that would be nice if I could find one.,1405209600,,281,3.7288135593220337
5540247,4,B00B0C23SE,Very straight forward but too advanced for me at this time in my yoga practice,1404345600,2,78,4.266666666666667
5540248,5,B00B0C23SE,Easy to follow and a great workout if you are a beginner or expert.  Is divided into 3 20 min workouts you can do one or all flows easily from one to another.  In addition there are additional extras for more difficulty.  Highly recommend.,1401494400,,239,4.386363636363637
5540249,5,B00B0C23SE,"Even though I have been doing some form of yoga either stretching or mixed in a strength or cardio workout, I still see myself as a beginner because I do not practice everyday.  I like the exercises.  I feel I get a good stretch and my muscles feel less tight after each session.  I notice I have more flexibility, which helps me tremendously with my cardio and strength workouts.  I have incorporated this workout 1 to 2 times a week as a part of my rotation.  I think it is a great beginner's yoga workout for those completely new to it, or somewhat familiar with the moves and transitions.",1400544000,,592,4.394495412844036
5540250,5,B00B0C23SE,I started practising yoga for the first time with this cd from Tara Lee. I found her steps easy to follow. Not too fast paced. And it really made me feel a difference in my leg muscles and lower back. I find this routine soothing and relaxing. A good way to start my day. I combine with harder routines now. I recommend this as a beginner routine.,1400371200,4,347,4.1940298507462686

I don't like typing words because a computer tells me to type more.",1400025600,,111,4.55
5540252,5,B00B0C23SE,The best video I've seen yet for a beginner.  Lots of variety and enjoyable.  Well produced.  Great augmentation to attending a class.,1398643200,,134,5.0
5540253,4,B00B0C23SE,"I would actually give this 4 1/2 stars!  I thought this DVD was appropriate for beginners.  Tara has a very soothing voice and method that is pleasant to follow.  I like how the segments are divided on the DVD for those days we might not want to do too much.  :)  My only objection is the segment which demonstrates what I think is called the ""pigeon pose.""  This pose was not introduced in my yoga class until we reached a certain level that was a bit beyond beginner since it really challenges the leg/thigh muscles.  It might be dangerous for beginners to try without the proper guidance.  Otherwise, a good DVD that can be used again and again.",1398211200,,648,4.432203389830509
5540254,5,B00B0C23SE,"I've been strength training and doing various cardio workouts for years, but at 43 I'm feeling less flexible and wanted to give something new a try. This workout is just the right introduction to yoga. I like the 20 minute segments - you can stop after one segment or just let the DVD play on through if you feel up to it and have the time. I recommend setting up a quiet, serene place for your practice, and use candlelight - really sets the tone for introspection. Thanks Tara, for making such a great DVD!",1392940800,5,508,4.3578947368421055
5540255,3,B00B0C23SE,I was looking for a yoga DVD that is not too crazy...but this is just too easy... Not what ad sounded like.,1384214400,,107,3.909090909090909
5540256,4,B00B0C23SE,I think this has shown me some other aspects of yoga I have not seen before.  I am glad I purchased it.,1381795200,,103,3.6818181818181817
5540257,5,B00B0C23SE,I like Tara and how she has a peaceful presence and explains all the poses so they are easily understood.  I felt very relaxed after just the first session and a half.  Working up to doing the whole DVD. :)  I would get another DVD of her's in the future.,1376524800,5,255,4.06
8560227,5,B00B0C23SE,Tara Lee is the best at home Yoga instructor that I have ever practiced with.,1524096000,,77,4.2
8560228,5,B00B0C23SE,"This is my first Tara Lee DVD and I love it.  I was a regular and devoted yoga practitioner many years ago, then let up so I am not necessarily a beginner other than in my current fitness level.  I found her voice very pleasing and at a nice comforting pace.  I also enjoyed the background music as well.  I did tend to get distracted by the lovely birds flitting around in the background but that is just me and a minor issue.  I enjoyed the breathing instruction, and slow but steady yoga flow.  I would recommend this DVD and am going to order more from Tara Lee.  I have other DVD's by Rodney Yee, and Patricia Walden and am very happy to have discovered Tara Lee",1523750400,,667,4.2047244094488185

8560232,5,B00B0C23SE,Tara lee is amazing. She really has a good routine. It's not irritating. She know when to give breaks. The music is really nice and soft. It's perfect. Love her flow and fire too.,1494720000,2,179,4.294117647058823
8560233,3,B00B0C23SE,"Hard to really do a review on this DVD. The quality is excellent and the instructor is excellent. The issue with me is that she goes too fast between poses and doesn't give options for those of us who aren't as advanced in yoga as others. I've been doing yoga only about 5 months now and am almost 68yo, so this was too difficult for me to keep up with. I'll keep it and may be able to use it later or pass it on to a friend. I have other DVDs that I use and like but am always on the lookout for more variety.
So, it's not that the DVD needs only three stars; it's my yoga level that can give it only three stars. If you know what I mean.",1493251200,,639,3.81203007518797
8560234,5,B00B0C23SE,"I really like this DVD a lot.  I have many yoga dvd's.  Everything from Denise Austin, to Raviana Kundalini, to the 10 minute series, Shiva Rea and more.  I like them all for various reasons.

The reason I like this DVD so much is because it is gentle on the body/back yet it makes you feel wonderful and healthy.  I have lower back issues so I especially like the gentle lower back movements in the first section.

I also like it because the movements are unique and enjoyable to do. And not too hard yet effective.

Not long ago I did section one and two and afterwards I walked my dog. I noticed my posture was so straight, so upright naturally...all because of this video.  Having this straight posture made me feel very healthy, ""open"" and led me to breathe better.

Another time I did section one and three. That was also effective.

I also pick this up when I don't have a lot of energy but want to feel good.

This dvd offers a lot and I am happy I have it.",1490572800,7,965,4.218579234972678
8560235,3,B00B0C23SE,"I wanted to like this but after having it for over a year, I have only used it twice. It's probably fine for some people, but I prefer other yoga DVDs to this one. It moves too fast in some areas and then slow in others. It just doesn't mesh well with me.",1487116800,,255,3.830188679245283
