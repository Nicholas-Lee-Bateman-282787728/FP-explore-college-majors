I am sad and sorry to report that the quality of this DVD was poor, at best.  Very fuzzy and of no interest to my grandchildren who are not used to such poor quality viewing.",1504483200,,312,4.288135593220339

1743807,1,B00006D28S,This is for the A2ZCDs.com. It goes from Gulliver washing ashore after his ship is destroyed by the storm to the two kings discussing the wedding  and Gabby trying to tell the king about a giant on the beach. Where is the scene with Gabby discovering him?,1494720000,,255,4.425531914893617
1743808,5,B00006D28S,"There are probably at least 100 films with which every American should be familiar by the time they reach young adulthood.  Several are children's films, both live and animated, including:  The Wizard of Oz, Miracle on 34th Street,  National Velvet, Snow White, Bambi, Mary Poppins.  Gulliver's Travels is certainly among these.  Produced in 1939 (the GREATEST year in movie history), Gulliver's Travels was only the second full-length animated feature film ever produced (less than 2 years behind Disney's Snow White).  Yes, I know the story line bears no more resemblance to the Jonathan Swift classic than the Wizard of Oz does to the Frank Baum novelettes.  So what?  These are great flicks...for kids and any of us who was ever a kid.  Apparently, the problem with Gulliver's Travels is that after the demise of the Fleisher Brothers Studio which produced it, the film fell into the public domain where any one could produce and market copies;  some faithful to the original, some ""restored"" with varying results, some absolutely dreadful.  So, which copy to add to our collection?  I gambled on the 60th Anniversary Limited Edition (1999) by North Hampton Partners, Ltd.  I am well pleased with my choice.  To be sure, the video and especially the audio are far from perfect.  But this DVD gives you 4 sound choices, and it is eminently watchable...preferably with small children to share it.  Gulliver's Travels is one of my earliest movie memories.  It's been at least 50 years since I saw this film in it's entirety, and seeing it again quickly took me back to my childhood.  I was delighted by the nearly non-stop sight-gags among the minor characters, and moved by the plight of the separated lovers.  I caught myself humming ""All's Well"" and ""Faithful, Forever"" throughout the rest of the day.  And its lessons of KINDNESS,  fidelity (""Faithful-Forever""), and avoiding pettiness are timeless.  There may be better, cleaner video versions out there, but you will not go wrong by choosing this 60th Anniversary Limited Edition.  Finally, kudos to the merchant, ThriftPro.  The DVD arrived in only 3 days (?!), in new condition as promised, and for a very reasonable price.",1494028800,,2182,5.013927576601671

1743826,1,B00006D28S,"It looks like the poster for the live action movie but it's actually a cartoon.  Gulliver doesn't play much of a part, at least up to the point where we turned it off.  He passes out on the beach after his ship wrecks.  Then it was 15 minutes of comic liliputians running around.  I'm not sure if it's Disney.  I don't think so.  It got boring so, like I said, we turned it off.",1476921600,,378,4.04054054054054

1743840,3,B00006D28S,"I just finished reading the book and wanted to see what a film version would portray. I was not engaged as the story was overly long in developing.
The animation seemed to be the priority instead of Gulliver's acclimating to a different world. I fast forwarded through most of it.",1465603200,,280,4.62
1743841,5,B00006D28S,"This is the second, feature length animated film in history (released after Walt Disneys Snow White).  The story is very-very loosely based on Gullivers Travels by Jonathan Swift.  The plot is limited.  Two kingdoms are about to be joined through marriage when the king of Blefuscu throws a snit over a dopey song and when he doesnt get his own way he declares war.  Think about it, the King of Liliput is giving his daughter in marriage, hes supplying the food, the flowers, and even the wedding ring King Bombos son is supposed to give to his daughter!!!  And yet the lunatic Bombo gripes over his dopey song not being sung at the wedding!!!!  And then along comes Gulliver.  In one of the longest sequences in the film, hes tied down and transported to the castle.  Through no fault of his own, Gulliver gets embroiled in the battle between the two kingdoms.  Why King Little would want his daughter to marry the son of a lunatic with spies, who orders his spies to assassinate Gulliver while he is launching an attack by sea...........not the kind of family youd want to marry into!!!!

Ive always thought this movie was weird, fun and funny, but definitely weird.",1464480000,,1168,4.6536585365853655

1743843,3,B00006D28S,Find a Bluray restoration of it. The DvD I found was one of those public domain VHS transfers that is intolerably grainy. Otherwise it is just FLiesher animation in its prime that isn't Superman.,1462406400,,195,4.764705882352941
1743844,5,B00006D28S,"This book was written in the 1700's. The language is thick and uncommon to today's times. The story is wonderful, but exhausting to read. We also got a video, which I would suggest. We thought it would be fun to read a classic story, but for a 7 year old and his mother in 2016, it wasn't . I gave the book a 5 because the story was wonderful, but the writing style wore us out.",1462406400,,378,3.986842105263158

The colors are all washed out, sometimes her dress looks pink, sometimes it's blue.  There are hairs running all through the film, and all those white spots from a really old film.  Now I know there has to be better copies out there somewhere because I've actually streamed the whole movie on Youtube and it looked GREAT!

Gulliver's Travels: During his first voyage, Gulliver is washed ashore after a shipwreck and finds himself a prisoner of a race of tiny people, less than 6 inches tall, who are inhabitants of the island country of Lilliput. After giving assurances of his good behavior, he is given a residence in Lilliput and becomes a favorite of the court. Gulliver is also given permission to roam around the city on a condition that he must not harm their subjects. Gulliver assists the Lilliputians to subdue their neighbors, by stealing their fleet. However, he refuses to reduce the island nation of Blefuscu to a province of Lilliput, displeasing the King and the court. Gulliver is charged with treason for, among other ""crimes"", ""making water"" in the capital (even though he was putting out a fire and saving countless lives). He is convicted and sentenced to be blinded, but with the assistance of a kind friend, he escapes to Blefuscu. Here he spots and retrieves an abandoned boat and sails out to be rescued by a passing ship, which safely takes him back home. This book of the Travels is a topical political satire.

When the sailing ship Adventure is blown off course by storms and forced to sail for land in search of fresh water, Gulliver is abandoned by his companions and found by a farmer who is 72 feet (22 m) tall (the scale of Brobdingnag is about 12:1, compared to Lilliput's 1:12, judging from Gulliver estimating a man's step being 10 yards (9.1 m)). He brings Gulliver home and his daughter cares for Gulliver. The farmer treats him as a curiosity. Since Gulliver is too small to use their huge chairs, beds, knives and forks, the queen commissions a small house to be built for him so that he can be carried around in it; this is referred to as his 'traveling box'. Between small adventures such as fighting giant wasps and being carried to the roof by a monkey, he discusses the state of Europe with the King. The King is not happy with Gulliver's accounts of Europe, especially upon learning of the use of guns and cannons. On a trip to the seaside, his traveling box is seized by a giant eagle which drops Gulliver and his box into the sea, where he is picked up by some sailors, who return him to England.

1744063,5,B00006D28S,"When I saw this at a local library, I thought it was a repackaged version of the Koch ""kock-screen"" DVD/BD from years back. However, I saw Thunderbean's name on the cover and I heard the quality on their releases is above superb. Being that borrowing from libraries is free, I thought I would give this one a shot. Both the DVD & BD are taken from the sharpest and highest quality source available and look amazing (even the DVD version!). I found no digital imperfections or line twittering on both discs.
The AR is the full 1.37:1 framing (you can even see the ""lens curves""), however for those who own plasmas or are concerned about black borders on their screen, TAKE NOTE OF ONE THING WITH THIS RELEASE! Both the DVD & Blu-Ray keep the 1.37:1 ratio encoded in the 1920x1080 widescreen frame for BD, and 720x480 anamorphic widescreen for the DVD, thus resulting in pillarboxing that occurs even on 4:3 displays. For those who dislike the factor, the ""Wide"" or ""Zoom"" settings on your TV via the remote will solve this. The audio is pretty good if a bit aged and somewhat scratchy, but far above the week 5.1 job on the Koch DVD release that added Ren & Stimpy sound effects, and applied heavy audio noise reduction that made everyone sound wispy.

The only extras on both discs are a few Popeye and Betty Boob(p) cartoons, which are presented in excellent quality (for the most part). 3 of the Betty Boop shorts are in good quality with one having its complete Paramount openings/end titles, while two of them have U.M.&M titles. There are two Popeye cartoons here that also look great and are complete with their Paramount opening/closing titles, while one is in somewhat mediocre shape and has wobbly & ultra dark AAP openings/credits. Aside from the varying source quality of these shorts, they appear much sharper here in both SD & HD than on the WB discs.

Thunderbean here did an amazing job her not only in the content and quality, but providing the same materials on both DVD & Blu-ray in a combo pack. The price its going for on here is very good, so if I could I would buy 2 copies (with one to give to a buddy) to support this company and the outstanding quality of their products!",1379980800,,2196,4.556962025316456
1744064,5,B00006D28S,"In 1939, the animators, Max and Dave Fleischer set out to adapted Jonathan Swift is novel into a movie, after Walt Disney's Snow White has succeed two years earlier, and was the second American feature film ever released. The film is technical masterpiece, and mostly noted for the rotoscoping technology used to animate Gulliver. But with all its technical all claim, story wise the movie, falls rather flat, and is not very faithful to the Jonathan Swift is orignal vision. First its only adapts the first voyage, meaning that the voyages to Brobdingnag,  Voyage to Laputa, and Voyage to Houyhnhnms are not there, so if your looking for complete film adaption of the original novel, then this animated movie is one to avoid. Secondly it miss the point of the social satire, in the original novel. So your best adviced to track down a later adaption of the story and the most recommended one's the 1996 TV-mini series. As it includes the all four Voyages, and thus most faithful to the original story.

But If you are American film or American Animation Buff then this film is defiantly for you, as I mentioned earlier it was released to rival Disney in the Animated feature film market, and it had some success doing so. IF you have already added Betty Boop, Popeye and Superman to your collection then this one is defensively a must have in your collection.

But be forewarned though there several VHS, DVD releases out there and most of them are mixed bag, so read research carefully what you are buying if you want VHS or DVD copy of the film. But the film has once before been released on Blu-Ray, by Koch vision which did an terrible job at ""restoring"" the film, it was cropped and squished. Meaning it was butchered to oblivation. Avoid that Blu-ray at all cost. But This is the second time the film will be released on Blu-ray this time by Steve Stanchfield Thunderbean Animation, which has brought us many wonderful Animation DVDs including PD cartoons form the major animation studios form Hollywood's golden age. As well as oddball, rare and obscure cartoons from minor players.

1744067,5,B00006D28S,"A Blue Ray release of Fleischer Studio classics is an animation event of the first order.  I grew up with the Fleischer Brothers rather than Disney, always searching for their Superman and Popeye cartoons on the few television channels available to a child in the sixties.  Through the miracle of VHS tape, I later introduced my kids to Popeye, Superman and Gulliver, falling in love with these productions once again.  I am anxiously awaiting the Blue Ray conversion from original film and suspect that there will be a three generation viewing at our home at some point in the future.

Max Fleischer began making animated shorts in 1915 and produced the first sound cartoons four years before Disney in 1924.  He built Fleischer studios with brother Dave, releasing the first Betty Boop short in 1930.  The success of Popeye cartoons in the movies helped the Fleischers expand until they moved their Manhattan studio to Miami, employing as many as 700 people.  In 1941, the studio released the first of 17 classic Superman cartoons,receiving an Academy Award nomination.

The Superman series is still the best animated representation of a comic book character.  The cartoons had a dark, Art Deco look which Fleischer Studios enhanced using their patented rotoscoping technique.  The Mechanical Monster episode is considered to be the strongest entry in the series and obviously influenced robot design in Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow.  The three Technicolor, two reel, extended Popeye cartoons are masterpieces of humor and characterization.  Popeye Meets Sindbad the Sailor has been voted one of the top 20 cartoons of all time.  (My kids never tire of the color, action and comedic bits in this short and, to be honest, neither have I.)  The full length Gulliver's Travels cartoon was produced by more than 700 artists in 18 months.  Only a modest box office success, it suffered from poor timing of release, uninspired marketing and comparison to Disney's Snow White.  Fleischer's Gulliver is still enjoyable to watch including a beautiful sequence in which the Giant is bound by ropes and some over-the-top humor provided by the character of Gabby.

Fleischer Studio productions were less polished than those of Disney while, at the same time, risking and delivering more for some viewers.  Their work has been described as ""sophisticated, focused on surrealism, dark humor, adult psychological elements and sexuality.""  The mileau is often grittier and more urban while the background music can be more raw ""fitting with the unflinching Fleischer look at Americas multi-cultural scene.""  Story telling was less traditional relying on visual as well as narrative drive.  Author of The Fleischer Story Leslie Cabarga suggests that ""manipulation of reality had been the essence of their animation.""  He contrasts this with the more successful formula which Walt Disney described: ""You can't have too much in a picture that taxes the audience's believability.""  By the late thirties, the Fleischer Brothers tried more and more to imitate Disney's winning approach.  Carbarga suggests this led to declining quality and derivative results for Fleischer productions.

In 1994, a group of animation professionals selected the best cartoons of all time.  Five Flescher cartoons made the top 40 (led by Popeye/Sindbad at 17).  I'm glad the Fleischer's have received accolades from their peers. For me, however, Fleischer prodictions are the most colorful, dynamic and compelling products of American animation as well as the most original by far.  Use this Blue Ray release to sample their work and if you are hooked, check out the Popeye the Sailor 1933-1938 DVD as well as the full Superman collection",1377820800,,3708,5.207419898819562

1744116,2,B00006D28S,"After the huge success that was `Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' took the world by storm in 1938, it appeared that the animated feature film was going to become `a thing' and so everyone was trying their hands at it.  Fleischer Studios pushed out this well regarded animated classic the following year, but was pretty much ignored due to the grandness of the year in question (highly considered to be the greatest year for film of all time).

It really isn't a surprise that the film has its supporters, but it also isn't a surprise to me that it was almost ignored entirely upon its release.

It has some nice animation considering that time, and the musical aspects of the film are sweet and vocally compelling, and the general storyline, while simplistic at best, is endearing in parts; but the end result is almost too light (and too redundant).  The fact that nearly half the movie consists of a single scene (that is an exaggeration, but honestly the scene where they tie up Gulliver is WAY TOO LONG) is a tiresome bore.

The film opens with a shipwreck that leaves Gulliver on an island of little people.  Not midgets or dwarfs but people the size of his thumb.  We then cut to these little people about to engage in a war because the wedding between Princess Gloria and Prince David has been called off since their respective ruling fathers cannot agree on a wedding song (seriously).  In the middle of this war is the giant on the beach, who turns out to be a peaceful man who comes up with a way of stopping the war and saving the marriage.  It is a rather anti-climactic ending and the film doesn't really make much of an impact as a whole.

For the nostalgia factor, this has some nice moments, but overall it just doesn't live up to its inspiration (the classic novel feels richer than this) or its predecessor (like this could compete with `Snow White').  There is practically no character development, the dialog is coarse and not really engaging, the story progression is bare at best and the end result is a mediocre film at best.",1355097600,,2048,4.553133514986376

1744137,2,B00006D28S,"After Max Fleischer feel behind Disney at the wake of technicolor and Snow White Max still wanted to seem relevant still seem worth just as much in the industry. Both him and Paramount feel behind the industry and essentially wanted to make products that perpetuated that they were still ahead of everyone else. Paramount said they were still relevant by commercially exploiting everything they had including the Fleischer's which made the Fleischer's technically fall behind others because they were so focused on commercialization by the early forties the Fleischer product is so tasteless that not even Popeye can sell some of the poor production quality.

Essentially with Gulliver's Travels Max says that he can produce a superior Snow White by adhering to the New York mentality of doing things, that it is more of a commercial trade and not artistically inclined or bearing standards such as Snow White. It is futile for him to believe that he could have made a better Snow White by being dependent upon production methods that were far more inferior.  This film is so over-focused on trying to out-merit Snow White by being stylistically the same. Had he been more focused on what technologies and resources he had at his disposal he would have made something superior to this train-wreck exceptionally far from the zenith of what their studio produced. The narrative is not very well fleshed out nor are the characters, the narrative revolves around this musical feud no sub-plots its as if your trying to sustain a seventy five minute movie without proper story structure or sub-plots. This once again comes from their New York mentality of not building to much story structure around a film but focusing more on the gags.

Walt Disney set standards such as personality animation, story structure, motion study that this film does not display. Characters are horribly fleshed out the spies Sneak Snoop and Snitch are of malevolent intent yet hardly sophisticated or well developed and in many cases have to many comedic elements to be taken seriously. The feud cannot sustain a seventy five minute film as elaborated before due to the fact that you need a more fleshed out narrative in such a format, it is a kin to trying to make a feature centered around a series of gags which is what New York Cities silent animation production system did in short subjects.

One of the reasons the quality suffers is a short production period to avoid competing with Fantasia and Pinocchio two of which are light years ahead yet were commercial flops due to the European market being shut out as a potential place to distribute the film. Gulliver supposedly suffered the same fate according to Paramount who acquired the company by saying that Gulliver was in the red and hadn't made a profit. Based on Ray Pointer's wonderful research it turns out that Gulliver was distributed over in Europe. Much of these profits may have been enough to by back the loan they borrowed from Paramount and then some.

I'm sorry to any of the cult-followings this film has received but honestly this is a disaster. Max could have made better out of it by exploiting certain technologies and focusing on their own strengths but he is so over-focused on trying to out-merit Disney to gratify his ego that he still relevant and ahead of everyone in the industry. Max was only relevant in popular culture because of Popeye by 1939, this film does not prove that he is ahead of Disney.",1305417600,,3462,4.861016949152543
1744138,5,B00006D28S,"I hadn't seen this film in probably 40 years, but once I heard the opening it all started to come back to me. Gulliver's Travels is an early full length animated classic film put out by the Fleischer studio and is it's crown jewel. Unfortunately the film has looked battered was edited in every edition ever released. That is until they released the 60th anniversary edition in 1999. The film looks really good with a crisp picture and 4 audio options including the original soundtrack. I prefer the original, but Dolby Surround was a nice addition.

If you've never seen this film, you may not know what all the ""hub-bub"" is about, but for those of us who grew up watching this film, it is a real treasure to see it looking so good! While I don't think the animation is quite up there with Disney's best efforts, the characters and the animation style are certainly beautiful in their own right.

The DVD includes the full film restored running 76 minutes with 4 audio options, two Gabby cartoons, a small making of Fleischer cartoons from the studio, a restoration comparison of the Superman cartoons and a stills gallery.

1744157,3,B00006D28S,"At first glance this movie looks WAY better than any other public domain version released.  But if you look closer, it has it's shortcomings, as have been addressed by others.

Only a very discerning eye will be able to see the ""stretching"" of the screen to fit the 16x9.  But the cropping is noticable.  Many points Gulliver's head is cut off and other details at the top are cut off.  The DVD points out that you'll be able to see more on the sides than ever before.  Which is true, there is slightly more you can see on the side you couldn't see on other versions, because I believe the original theater ratio is slightly longer than the 4:3 TV screen.  But, the amout cut off at the top is more than is extended on the sides.  So, where's the benefit?  Never understood why they don't release these older movies with a very small bar on the top and bottom to keep the original ratio.  Also, it seems when they cleaned up the film they took frames out or something, because it's not as smooth as the original version, which was extremely smooth animation, as most Fleicher products were.  It's very noticable when the film pans, there is a definite judder that was not there in the original.

On the other hand, it's very bright, colorful, crisp and free of screen debris.  It looks great for the most part.  Just wish they would have gotten the screen ratio right and kept the animation smoother, even if it meant not cleaning it quite as well.  I recommend it, but you have to get past the shortcomings.",1243468800,,1508,4.432727272727273

1744159,1,B00006D28S,"The people who worked with Koch on this release wasted their time with high hopes that they could make a profit off of deceptive advertising and false claims.

For starters, this film is public domain and companies like Koch can do anything they want with the film. The sad thing is, they did everything they wanted with this film and thought they made a quality product when in fact, they just destroyed an animated classic.

The most common criticism for this Blu-Ray that I support is the fact that the film's aspect ratio has been altered. This film was originally shot in a 1.37:1 aspect ratio. What Koch did was stretch the picture to a 1.77:1 aspect ratio so that it fits perfectly on an HDTV screen. As a result, Gulliver and all the other characters in the film look fatter than they are supposed to be. Aside from altering the picture, the soundtrack has also been altered. Sound effects that weren't originally there have been added to the soundtrack so that it could be ""enhanced"". Lastly, the two Gabby shorts in the bonus features section are not outtakes from the movie. A series of Gabby theatrical shorts was made to build on the success of Gulliver's Travels.

I would advise people who want a good looking version of this film without any alterations to stay away from this release and anything released by these people. These people have previously worked with Winstar to release a series of ""Cartoon Crazys"" DVDs and later on worked with GoodTimes. As always, these people do nothing but butcher classic cartoons that have fallen into the public domain.",1240099200,,1574,4.737226277372263

Koch completely butchered this classic animated feature. The most notable alteration to the film was stretching the picture from its original 1.37:1 aspect ratio into a 1.77:1 aspect ratio so it will fill up the entire screen on an HDTV. As a result, Gulliver and all the characters look fatter than they actually are. Aside from altering the picture, sound effects have been added to the soundtrack that weren't originally there. Lastly, the two Gabby cartoons in the bonus features section are not outtakes from the movie. A series of Gabby theatrical shorts were actually made to build on the success of this feature film.",1240099200,,807,4.8478260869565215

Oh, Fred, as for the Monty Python comparison, there's no point, as Gulliver's was created in 1:37 (*cough* Pinocchio on Blu-ray *cough*). And 1.85:1 multiplies out to 16x8.65, hence the black letterbox bars to fill the vertical void of .35 of 9. Not 16.65x9.",1239062400,,775,4.916030534351145

Virtually all Hollywood films made prior to 1953 were shot and composed for the much more square 1.37x1 screen (just about identical to the older 4x3 TV sets).  For years movie fans have badgered TV stations and video companies to letterbox post-1953 widescreen films so as to avoid cropping important information out of the image.  Now that we have widescreen TVs the opposite problem exists and it's the movies made prior to 1953 that will suffer as the tops and bottoms of the image will be removed (or the image geometrically ""squished"").

1744220,2,B00006D28S,"""Gulliver's Travels""  is the 1939 animated feature produced and directed by Max and Dave Fleischer.  This was the Fleischers' response to the enormous success of Disney's ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,"" made the year before.  Following the Disney model, the Fleischers pulled out all the stops, shooting in Technicolor and adding songs.  A huge staff of artists worked on the picture.  This was in the days when animation was done one cel, or picture, at a time, photographed in sequence until a movement and then a scene was created.  The process, even then, was costly and ""Gulliver's Travels"" helped bring about the Fleischers' bankruptcy, since box office receipts in no way compared to those for ""Snow White.""
 After a shipwreck, Gulliver washes ashore on Lilliput and tries to prevent war between that wee kingdom and the equally tiny Blefiscu.  He also serves as a kind of matchmaker between the royal heads of both kingdoms, Princess Glory and Prince David, hoping their romance might form an alliance.  Fleischer touches include the characters of Gabby, Sneak, Snoop, and Snitch, who are on hand for comic relief and to hamper Gulliver's attempts to be peacemaker.
 Earlier editions of ""Gulliver's Travels"" suffered badly from fading and choppy editing due to the fact that the film had been in the public domain for many years.  This Blu-ray edition, however, is restored and remastered from an original 35-millimeter print and enhanced for 16x9 High Definition.  It looks great on a Hi-Def TV.  However, because the picture was adjusted for the Widescreen format, portions of the image have been cropped.  Purists will be very unhappy with this.  It strikes me as odd that such care would be taken with the restoration and then undermined by cropping the Blu-ray print.  Bonus features include two Gabby cartoons and the Fleischer documentary ""The Making of a Cartoon.""",1237420800,,1883,5.064935064935065

My interest was peaked by reviews that claim that 25% of the image area was cut off in this version and the rather withering reviews. So I checked. First, the film is not presented in a true 16X9 aspect ratio, but something closer to 15X9. As I read the savage reviews about cropping i remembered that Michael Palin, in his diaries (available on Amazon), mentioned that they shot Monty Python's first films on 35mm stock. the ratio on those films, in their widescreen releases the aspect ratio was 1.85 to 1, which multiplies to 16.65 to 9. However I don't see all of these intrepid reviewers bitching about the top of the Black Knight's head being cut off. The film is presented in widescreen format the same way that the Monty Python films have been presented in widescreen, with black bars on either side of the screen and the image area from top to bottom determining the side to side ratio. 25% of this masterpiece is not missing, as claimed by some reviewers. This version is a beautiful conversion and would be a great addition to your collection. Be wary of the reviews that make unsubstantiated claims. My BS detector went off big time. This BluRay presentation is done with great affection for the source material. See for yourself. Show your kids this classic and see what they say.",1237161600,,1376,4.597560975609756

As a long time animation fan (with several versions of Fleisher's Superman cartoons so I have some reference points to make visual comparisons) it's clear to see that this release has been handled with great respect and attention to detail. Some reviews make is sound like huge portions of the film have been cropped for this release, and that's simply not true. The aspect ration of this release is far better than the TV ratio that I remember seeing this on TV as a youngster. The striking thing is the colour. Like many of the classic Disney films that have been restored, this version delivers incredible colour and clarity, which surpasses what I saw on TV. The soundtrack is also impressive. That's the technical stuff, now on to the artistry of this film. First, it's a great story, but the style of the animation is distinctly Fleischer, and Like his Superman cartoons, he was years ahead of his time in his animation work. In fact, I cannot imagine the work that went into this film, and in that era. The colour palette used in this release is true to the era, not some colourisation to today's sensibilities. That's a critical element, because the story is enhanced by the dreamlike quality of the art and colours. Animation fans will want this in their library.

""January 5, 2009: The March 2009 KOCH Vision release of Max Fleischer's Gulliver's Travels on Blu-ray (and on standard-def DVD) has been restored and re-mastered from the original source 35mm film by North Hampton Partners, the same company that received universal acclaim for their restoration work on the 60th Anniversary Edition DVD ten years ago. These talented individuals have gone back to the same source materials and used the best technology available to present the film in a manner consistent with today's standards. This ambitious process included the decision to enhance the film, frame-by-frame, for 16x9 - so that it could be fully appreciated and enjoyed on HD televisions. North Hampton Partners firmly believes that their efforts have resulted in the best version of Gulliver's Travels ever available to the consumer market.

KOCH Vision is extremely proud to release these newly restored editions and stands behind them 100%.""

Having personally seen the DVD in advance, the presentation in 16x9 is without any loss of image that I could pick up, along with no noticable distortion of characters or objects. Colors looked more vibrant than on the 60th anniversary Winstar edition that I also own. I am totally looking forward to seeing the Blu Ray and will certainly post my opinions after seeing it upon release (as requested by KOCH Vision in their note above).

I am thrilled to have heard that this release is coming in a format that will take advantage of our new big screen TV. I have long wanted to see it this way. Can't wait!",1229990400,,1774,4.939597315436242

I have been privilaged to see an early disc of this edition and my kudos to North Hampton Partners and KOCH for creating the best looking Gulliver's to date. The colors look fantastic, the sound options from original to 5.1 Dolby sound fantastic. Simply put this was a big job, I am sure, and the result is Gulliver in size.

Produced by Fleischer in 1939 on a $1 million budget provided to them by Paramount Pictures, the film was created to compete with Walt Disney's Snow White and is, to this date, considered a feat in feature film animation history. Filled with songs, including ""It's a Hap, Hap Happy Day"" and ""All's Well"", Gulliver's is a delight to watch at any age.

Jonathan Swift's historic tale certainly comes to big life in this animated tale of a giant landing on the small island of Lilliput following a storm at sea. My favorite moment is right at the beginning when ""Gabby"" discovers the giant hand of Gulliver and begins counting fingers. (As and aside, there are two Gabby cartoons on this disc as well).

This edition was clearly put together with love and adoration and I will add it to my collection of classics the moment it comes out. It's reasing on Blu-ray as well, day and date.",1229212800,,1303,4.489451476793249

1744280,5,B00006D28S,"Shipwrecked by a storm in 1699, Dr. Lemuel Gulliver ends up on a strange island inhabited by tiny little people.

One of the great animated features (it was only the second released in the United States, Disney's SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN Dwarfs in 1937 being the first) GULLIVER'S TRAVELS is an enjoyable film which should bring pleasure to uncritical viewers. Technically it is well made, with Technicolor animation of a generally high quality.

However, it is ultimately unfair to compare the Fleischer Studio output with that of Disney. Max & Dave Fleischer had their own star to follow; their contribution - and it would be a considerable one - would be in the realm of the one-reel cartoon. With their POPEYE and BETTY BOOP series they created alternate realities as viable as any produced by other cartoon studios. GULLIVER was their first foray into feature length animation (HOPPITY GOES TO TOWN would be their second in 1941), and eventually they would expend their energies again on the cartoon short subject, including the highly acclaimed SUPERMAN series which would commence in 1941.

GULLIVER'S TRAVELS is of course based on the classic novel by Jonathan Swift (with a little nod to Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet) focusing only on the section dealing with the minuscule kingdoms of Lilliput and Blefuscu. In place of Swift's irony is a great deal of slapstick, but such is the nature of the animated cartoon. The personalities of the royal youngsters, one from each of the rival nations, is left completely unexplored and their romantics is at the expense of more screen time with Gulliver, as are the exploits of the three incompetent Blefuscu spies. The film's main character is actually night watchman Gabby, who isn't very appealing (yet not too repellent to spawn a few further cartoons featuring his exploits). The film is at its best when it de-emphasizes plot for the visuals, as in the binding & transportation of the giant, or when the rotoscoped Gulliver tows the entire hostile fleet from Blefuscu up onto the beach by the ships' anchor chains.

Jack Mercer, famous as the voice of Popeye, here speaks for silly King Little. Pinto Colvig (best known as the original voice of Disney's Goofy) provides the vocals for Gabby. Gulliver is voiced by Sam Parker, while Jessica Dragonette & Lanny Ross sing for Princess Glory and Prince David.

The film has some pleasant songs including 'All's Well' and the Oscar nominated 'It's A Hap Hap Happy Day.' The two national anthems, 'Faithful' & 'Forever,' are fine romantic tunes which deserve to be rediscovered.

It is unfortunate that the Fleischers' remarkable Stereoptical Process, which could produce beautiful 3-D effects, is only glimpsed for a few moments during the opening credits.",1205884800,,2758,5.024070021881838
1744291,5,B00006D28S,"A black and white film that looks like animation but is none. The film is a very, very personal rewriting of Gulliver's Travels to Lilliput. In fact the whole film concentrates on two small kingdoms in Lilliput that are planning to marry their princess and prince but the fathers have a disagreement on which of two songs will have to be played at the wedding, ""Faithful"" or ""Forever"". And that leads to war. Gulliver is going to bring peace to this part of the world by making love win and by joining, merging, splicing them together. This rewriting is just charming but that's all. What makes that film unique is its date, 1939. That was a dream of this film maker to have peace in Europe, to bring together Hitler and Chamberlain, Freedom and Fascism like he was bringing Faithful and Forever together. A dream full of nave peace-loving but also blind humanism. In 1939, due to all kinds of mistakes for at least twenty years the war had become inescapable, unavoidable. But it is always refreshing to go back to the great idea that peace is possible in this world provided we accept to respect the other and to look for a reasonable compromise.  But what happens when such a reasonable compromise is no longer possible? We look for Weapons of Mass Destruction, of course.

1744294,4,B00006D28S,"So many DVD versions are available of this classic animated tale. These DVDs range from virtually unwatchable to fairly good quality. The Winstar 60th Anniversary issue is likely the best one there is. *I've not had the pleasure of viewing it, but I'm likely right.*

However, I saw this release from GoodTimes Home Video, and decided to pick it up. The banner on top says ""Digitally Restored."" But just how restored? I figured SOMETHING was done to it due to restoration credits being on the back of the box.

It hasn't been given a Criterion/Disney Platinum Edition/Warner Bros. caliber restoration, naturally, or I wouldn't have found it in the two-fifty bin at K-Mart. However, I can say from the preview that this is far better than just about any DVD of the film you'll find in the dollar bin. The color is very nice, the audio isn't as shrill as it is in most of the version I have. The print isn't as shaky as many of the ones you'll find, and many print defects have been cleaned up. A very nice surprise, especially since ""Digitally Remastered"" is often slapped across the top of many one dollar DVD covers.

A good note to add - the opening and closing logos are intact, which sadly can't be said for all releases. The opening credits are windowboxed to prevent the top, bottom, and sides from being cut off due to overscan on your TV set. However, the end logo is not windowboxed, but simply scrolls down to show the text on the bottom.

As can be expected for a DVD of this nature, there are no bonus materials. The menu gives you two options - play or scene index. The DVD is divided into twelve chapters - likely of equal length, so there's no real rhyme of reason as to why they begin where they do.

If you find this DVD at your local stores, don't hesitate to pick it up. It gives you a much better transfer of the movie than most DVDs of it you'll find. The Winstar release is likely better, but this release does exceed expectations for cheap-o DVDs. Big studios have released pricier DVDs of films with worse audio and video quality than this.",1186444800,,2064,4.464190981432361

Well, that may or may not be true, depending on how one looks at the film. True, the animation overall, but particularly of the incidental and secondary characters, is a bit on the crude side. Also, the character designs, as a whole, seem a bit more dated than the earlier ""Snow White"". Still, one of the things I have always loved about the Fleischer Studio is that they were the one studio that never tried to be Disney. MGM, Universal and even early Warner Brothers tried to emulated the lush quality of Disney cartoons and, for the most part, always fell short because by the time they got to where Disney was, Disney was already far ahead of them. But the Fleischer cartoons were always different. They developed a kooky but brazen quality all their own. There is no mistaking a Fleischer cartoon from the 1930s to around 1942. They have a unique, eccentric look and way of movement that no other studio had. A quirky, imaginative, jaunty quality that was bold, innovative, and unashamed. Once the studio was taken away from the Fleischers and changed over to ""Famous Studios"" all that changed and the studio output became more mainstream. But, during the great Popeye, Betty Boop and Superman era, the Fleischer cartoons remained origina and uniquel. And even with the rather ""rubbery"" Prince and Princess and the somewhat stiff Rotoscoped looking Gulliver, this feature embodies all the wonderful Fleischer qualities of their shorts, pushed up a notch for a feature and embellished with lavish backgrounds and dimensional sets or ""setbacks"", great songs and a wonderful rich score by Victor Young. Don't miss Gulliver and, if you like that, check out ""Hoppity Goes to Town"", (the second and final Fleischer feature). It is also very enjoyable.",1149206400,,1968,4.895209580838324

1744318,5,B00006D28S,"Here's a wonderful offering from the Fleischer Studio, creators of Betty Boop and Koko the Clown, and producers of the original Popeye and Superman cartoons.  The Fleischer brothers, Max and Dave, also put out the first sound cartoon, an animated sing-along with their trademark bouncing ball that highlighted the lyrics to the audience.  They also experimented with some truly effective special affects such as combining live action and animation, and the Three-Dimensional Setback which was a tiny stage with animation cels hung in front to create a convincing illusion of dimension.  One of their inventions, the Rotoscope, is still in use today.

The Fleischer Studio was active between 1919 and 1942, after which they folded due to increased competition from Disney.  By then features were the norm, and to meet this demand the Fleischers made two, GULLIVER'S TRAVELS (1939) and the rarely seen HOPPITY GOES TO TOWN (1941), originally known as MR. BUG GOES TO TOWN.  They were unable to make back the money put into these, so Paramount foreclosed their loan, took over the studio, and fired the Fleischers.  Later on the brothers recouped as Famous Studios but never quite regained the sparkle and innovation of their earlier days.

Timing wasn't on their side.  GULLIVER'S TRAVELS was made after another great animated film hit the theaters, the one with the seven short guys and a wicked witch and a girl who wanders the forest.  SNOW WHITE of course has become a legend of animation; in comparison GULLIVER'S TRAVELS fairly languishes and too bad.  Here's a noteworthy production that deserves its due.

There's a noticeable distinction between the animation styles of Disney and Fleischer.  The Fleischer style appears more arty, with stylized figures and backgrounds and lighting affects which I can only describe as ""Max Parrishesque.""  Gorgeous clouds and seas, and a rather glowing affect infused throughout.  The night scenes with Gabby and his lantern are especially effective, and the shadowing is superb.  Compared to SNOW WHITE, GULLIVER'S TRAVELS moves at a rather leisurely pace and the story is more expansive.  There's plenty to grow on you, too.  From the catchy tunes and the cute characters, to a towering, striking Gulliver with the brooding, thoughtful soul of a poet combined with the spunk and spirit of a true adventurer.",1105747200,,2351,5.158311345646438

If only the care devoted to the animation had also been devoted to the storyline, which is unable to sustain the momentum needed in a full-length film.  In particular, a number of the main characters (not the least of which is Gulliver himself) are quite bland and simply not that interesting.  To make things worse, the characters who are memorable include Gabby, the caricature of a pugnacious Irishman who surely has to rank as one the most annoying characters in the history of all animation.

Comparisons with Disney being inevitable, I believe that this is a case were the underdog matches the abilities of its powerful rival. The opening song ""All's Well"" is as catchy as any musical tune - including Snow White's ""Hi Ho"". The attention to 3-D effect and other visual detail is mind-boggling. The moral message of toleration and compromise is very well developed, and, in view of its sophisticated source in Jonathan Swift, the point is anything but trivial. Parents on the lookout for a great lesser-known animated film for their children should be delighted with this - as with Fleischer's other animated feature ""Hoppity Goes to Town"". This DVD edition restores the work to pristine condition. It comes with extra Gabby shorts, which draw on the same settings and characters; this was a nice surprise.

The film starts out without the opening credits and we noticed entire scenes have been deleted (as if taken from a bad film version that had been spliced together). ...

1744326,3,B00006D28S,"Producer Max Fleischer was Walt Disney's biggest competition in the 1930's and produced this animated feature in response to the success of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"".  Unfortunately, Fleischer's unit at Paramount didn't have the sophistication and artistic vision of Disney and their product ends up playing like an extended cartoon short.  Fleischer seemed to be more in his element with shorts, as can be seen with the perennial popularity of Betty Boop, Popeye, Felix the Cat and Superman.  Fleischer's shorts sometimes have more panache than Disney's Mickey Mouse shorts, which are almost insipid by comparison.  But in the field of animated features, Disney had and seems to have kept the edge all these years.  Good try Max.  The DVD print beats the public domain prints of ""Gulliver"" which are barely watchable.  A piece of trivia:  Gabby, the little lillipet man who sings ""All's Well"", had his voice provided by the same guy who did one of the munchkin mayor's cohorts in ""Wizard of Oz"", made by MGM in the same year.",1017100800,,1034,4.936416184971098
1744327,3,B00006D28S,"It's part of human nature to sympathise with the losers, the underdogs, the creative Davids in the face of corporate Goliaths; and the Fleischer Brothers' 'Gulliver's Travels' has taken a beloved place in film history as the nearly-was that challenged Disney's pre-eminence.  There's something knee-jerk in us that makes us automatically assume that 'Gulliver' is somehow superior, morally and artistically, to Disney's monster hit of the period, 'Snow White and the seven dwarves'.
It has to be admitted, however, that 'Gulliver' is very flawed, and, faced in the 1930s with a choice between this and 'Snow White', I would have gone with the latter.  It is unreasonable to expect a cartoon aiming for a mainstream, juvenile audience to remain faithful to Swift's original, bleakly coruscating satirical vision, but once you have reduced the book's four sections to one, have removed the politics, philosophy and anything that might be deemed 'unfit' for family consumption (Gulliver's notorious fire-extinguishing is considerably sanitised), there's not a lot left.
So the first problem with 'Gulliver' is its lack of plot.  there are lengthy set-pieces where nothing happens in the narrative, such as the engineering feat of tying up Gulliver, that can be boring for a young audience.  A related problem is character.  Unlike 'Snow White', which was scrupulous about naming and characterising all its players, 'Gulliver' has no-one to root for - the romantic couple are dull; Gulliver guffawingly bland; the comic relief irritating.  Add to this some ghastly operetta interludes, part of an unaccountable trend that also blighted the Marx Brothers' MGM films, and you don't have to look to the complete neutering of Swift's vision to complain.
There is equally much to astonish, which makes it tragic that the Fleischers didn't get another chance to improve on this noble failure.  If the film is weak in close-up and detail, it offers some magnificent, wider compositions, such as the patterns of firelight scurrying around Gulliver's beached body, or the alarm-wakening of a sleepy community.  The book's point of view is completely reversed, so that Gulliver is the stranger observed through the eyes of the 'normalised' community.  Some of Swift's darkness is allowed to remain, especially in a late 1930s context, in the story of two egomaniacal, ultra-nationalistic rulers forcing a war.
The story, influenced by 'Snow White' is given a Gothic, dark fairy tale landscape, increasing its visual beauty, while there is an extraordinary, Surrealist scene, where a King waltzes with a giant hand.",1002585600,,2600,5.321951219512195
1744328,3,B00006D28S,"I have always liked this film ever since I saw in on television
40 years ago. In the 1960s it was re-released for Saturday matinees, and I saw it for the first time in its Technicolor splendor in 1968. The potential for a big screen epic is certainly there. But over the years, Ive come to realize it's many shortcommings as well. The basic problem is that the feature does not develop the leading characters well. The personality of Gulliver seems too mild. His voice, by Sam Parker, does not have enough personality or character. Afterall, he was supposed to have been an Englishman. Instead he sounds like a poor man's Bing Crosby. Consider the possibilities if they had used Croby. After all, he was a Paramount contract player then. The central plot is about a silly war that is fought over which national anthem is to be played at the wedding of Prince David of Blefescu and Princess Glory of Lilliput. The audience is not given story material to establish these characters in order to
create any sympathy for them, especiall when the war threatens their union. What the film does do well is develop broad comedy supporting characters in the style Fleischer Studios was famous for. And in keeping with Max Fleischer's link to technical gimmics, Gabby's voice is produced in the same speeded up recording process used for the Munchkins in THE WIZARD OF OZ. In fact, Vance ""Pinto"" Colvig, who was the voice for the ""Mayor of the Munkckin City""(using his ""Goofy"" voice done for Walt Disney) played back 50% faster than normal, is the voice for Gabby. Other elements of the Fleischer genre deal with construction
sequences, such as the building of the scaffold and wheeled platform that lift and transport GULLIVER to the center of town.
The second, and my most favorite, is the ""It's a Hap-Hap-Happy Day"" sequence, where the Lilliputians make Gulliver a new suit of clothes. Sequences involving gadgets, and technical/construction processes were elements in many of the Fleischer cartoons, which they did very well. But technical sequences aside, the Fleischer animators were doing something they had not prepared for, personality animation. They were hard-pressed to maintain consistancy in the quality from one sequence to the next. Part of this was due to the rushed schedule, but mostly due to inexperience in creating believable and sympathetic characters that the audience could care about within a 70 minute structure. Oddly, the central characters, Gulliver, Prince David, and Princess Glory are more realistic-derived from Rototscoping, (Max Fleischer's premier animation invention) and are the least interesting characters, where the best characters are the cartoony supporting charaters, Gabby, King Little, and King Bombo.
This was not the only animated feature produced by Fleischer Studios.... Their second feature, ""Mr. Bug Goes to Town,"" a.k.a. HOPPITY GOES TO TOWN, overcame the animation problems, and was produced more efficiently, but still suffered from bland, underdeveloped leading characters. Still it is impressive and very beautiful to see. THIS was really the best thing next to the first nine SUPERMANS that the Fleischer Studios did. The Fleischer Studios' venture into features and greater personality animation was not so much an effort to imitate Disney was it was to move forward with the development
of the medium. The Fleischer's, once an innovators in the field, had remained locked into a formula that did not allow their animation to develop by the mid 1930s. As personality animation and greater drawing and design was moving forward on the west coast, the Fleischer cartoons continued to have an old fashioned look to them by the end of the decade. It was no wonder that when faced with doing an epic like GULLIVER'S TRAVELS they were faced with challenges they had not prepared for as Disney had done with his Silly Symphonies. But give them credit. They learned, but it's a shame that it came too late.",999734400,,3947,5.0552147239263805

You will probably enjoy the visual element of this film. (An entirely hand painted cartoon, like a living painting. Sensuous oceans that echo the block print style of the Japanese Ukiyo-E masters. Outstanding use of the masking effect.) If you enjoy animated art, these things should appeal to you.

1744342,5,B00006D28S,"In 1939 when this movie was released, it faced stiff competition at the Academy Awards from 'Gone with the Wind' and 'The Wizard of Oz.' Nominated for an Academy Award in 1939, it didn't win. But those who love this film will always believe that is should have. By 1939, the Fleischer Studios had been crafting the finest animation around -- they actually produced the first full length animated movie (though Disney gets the credit). This is the very best that the Fleischer Studios ever produced. Its characters are every bit as rich and deep as the very best Disney, Bluth or Spielberg-Katzenberg efforts. (Anyone who hears the classic line: ""There's a giant on the beach!"" -- will never forget it!) For years, I have wanted to get my hands on this and remaster this movie digitally. (I do effects and compositing for a living.) It's wonderful to see that someone who loves this movie has given it the care and respect it deserves. Max Fleischer was a sheer genius, whose work includes the original Betty Boop, Popeye, the animated Superman -- and his own contributions to film include techniques of effects production that are still used today. He was a master of his craft who, sadly, has little recognition outside artists and animators. I have bought many copies of this over the years -- usually in versions so poorly recorded and transfered that they are pitiful indicators of the Fleischer talent -- and yet, everyone I've given it to, loves the movie. My personal gratitude to Winfield Hoskins, Seymour Kneitel and Thomas Reich for your tender care in restoring such a wonderful movie. Thank you. It is truly long overdue and it is a case of giving honor to whom honor is due. This belongs right alongside the best Disney, tucked right on the shelf alongside Bluth's best -- and when the young and the young at heart ask ""What is this?"" -- play it. My grand daugther plays it regularly and never tires of it and always quites ""There's a giant on the beach"" -- and she laughs. This movie is simply pure magic -- breathtaking! Many of you will watch it and will suddenly remember seeing this long ago and your eyes will light up, just as many who I have bought it for, have said to me: ""I saw this years ago and have never known what it was.

1744346,3,B00006D28S,"I personally love this sweet, sentimental old movie, as I remember it fondly from many childhood viewings on TV.  I just got the new DVD, and I  think the restoration is quite decent.  Comparing it to the laserdisc  edition of some years back, the color is MUCH more well-balanced and  consistent.  This was a big distraction to me on the laserdisc, where it  would change from pastel to oversaturated from scene to scene.  I did note  a couple of instances of digital artifacts, i.e. dark backgrounds not  changing rapidly enough in relation to foreground figures, but I can  forgive this.  Considering the sales prospects, it must have been a  relatively low-budget project.  Listening on headphones, I found the  simulated stereo very attractive, though I can't comment on its  effectiveness as surround sound.  The original mono soundtrack is available  on an alternate track, if this is preferred.  I myself am delighted to have  it, but I can see that many people are perturbed by stylistic  inconsistencies, the cloying sweetness of the musical score, etc.  All  these ""faults"" which have been enumerated here and elsewhere  shouldn't diminish the enjoyment of the film for people who, like myself,  see it as a sweet, nostalgic souvenir of an earlier age when they, and the  world, were a bit younger.  Also (dare I say it?), even today some younger  kids might find it amenable, if they're not too jaded.

7967411,4,B00006D28S,"As tends to be the case with movies based on the book, ""Gulliver's Travels,"" the movie limits itself to relatively small portion of the book, where Gulliver visits the land of Lilliput.  The animation is remarkable and smooth, illustrating the relatively high number of frames per second used to make the movie.

This film was directed by Dave Fleischer and produced by Max Fleischer, known for their extensive animated features of the 1920's to the early 1940's, when the studio passed out of control of the Fleischer brothers.  ""Gulliver's Travels"" was one of two feature films produced by the studio also known for cartoons featuring Popeye, Superman, and Betty Boop.

In this movie, Gulliver washes up on the shores of Lilliput, where an enterprising watchman alerts the town to capture Gulliver.  Of course, Gulliver is a tremendous force, and he quickly escapes, becoming the champion of Princess Glory and Prince David, lovers from two kingdoms that are separated by a silly argument.  Even though Gulliver's point of view is logical, neither King Bombo or King Little is interested in logic or the desires of their offspring, only in their point of view, so war is imminent.  The rest of the film is, of course, up to the audience to watch, but it all leads to a happy ending as truth and logic outweigh lies and hyperbole.

While Fleischer studios put out a product that was deemed somewhat commercial and rough at the time, from a perspective that is more than seven decades later, this film is remarkably beautiful and detailed.  The images are fluid and colorful, with the only drawback being that the video in this DVD is unrestored.  Indeed, a restored version by Thunderbean Animation is considered to be a superior version of this film (look for ""Fleischer Classics Featuring Gulliver's Travels).

One other interesting artifact of this film is the appeal.  Fans of classic animation should love this film.  It certainly has a lot of adult appeal as well, with references that a child is not likely to understand.  However, the film has sufficient comedy with minimal tension (except near the end of the film, where there is a gun incident that ends well), so many children are likely to enjoy this movie as well.

Animated movies have been around since the beginning of film.  However, few were feature length up to the 1940's, with only two feature length films produced in the United States prior to 1940, the other being ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.""  This movie is considered by many to be one of the best animated films produced by Fleischer Studios, though going over budget on this filmed hastened the demise of the studio.  While this copy of the film is acceptable, look for the far superior Thunderbean version for improved picture and sound.
