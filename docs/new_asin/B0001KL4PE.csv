8013695,4,B0001KL4PE,"""Of course it's not real.  It's just a movie,"" the nun explains to the little girl at the beginning of ""Just One Look.""  We all have heard or made such remark some time or other.  ""Just One Look"" is a film that tries to capture the power movies have in our lives.

Fan (played by Shawn Yue) and Ming (Wong You Nam) are best friends who work in their families' food stalls right outside the town's movie theater.  When they are not selling sugar cane and fried fish balls, they are watching movies and cruising with their friends.  Like any teenaged boys of sixteen or seventeen, they talk and fantasize about sports (kung fu in this case), sex and girls. For better or for worse, their perceptions on all three subjects are influenced by the movies.  By the end of ""Just One Look,"" however, they will learn that not everything in life is like in the movies.

Fan may see himself in the place of the hero of the movies he watches.  He wishes he were blasting away ""Crazy"" (Anthony Wong), the man he thinks murdered his father.  But in reality, he has to content himself with taking shots at him covertly with a sling.  Ming admires the kung fu warriors of the films but time and again his teacher denounces the gravity defying fighting in the movies as a debasement of real martial arts and the glorification of violence.  Nam (Charlene Chou) is nicknamed the Chivalrous Lady, but it is hard to be chivalrous when the guy she likes doesn't like her back.  Movies, however, can be a positive influence too.  They entertain us. They become forever associated with memorable times in our lives.  They can open our eyes to the existence of a wider world as they do for Yueh (Gillian Chung), the girl who grew up in a convent.

""Just One Look"" is a much more thoughtful movie than the blurb on the back of the box would let on to be.  People expecting a happily-ever-after ending will be disappointed.  Like real life, this movie is bittersweet.  So disregard what the box says and enjoy this coming-of-age story where the main character, Fan must come to terms with the truth about his father's death, deals with unrequited love and at the same time discovers the joys and heartbreak of first love.  ""Just One Look"" takes us along his journey to adulthood while celebrating the spell movies cast in our lives.",1125705600,4,2304,4.532687651331719
8013696,4,B0001KL4PE,"A Fan (Shawn Yu) hated Crazy so much. He thought Crazy was the killer of his father (since he heard that Crazy would 'kill' the father if the father doesn't pay back his debt). In fact, his father was suicide, feeling hopeless of the life. In the father's coffin, A Fan found a big frog and he thought the frog was the reincarnation of the father...and that frog died because Crazy stepped on it! That's why for years A Fan regarded Crazy as the killer of his father. But without power, A fan couldn't do anything but hitting Crazy's head with stones for 10 years!

That's the beginning of the overall story. Basically, it's a simple story talking about how two grown-up guys chasing their dream girls and how they deal with day-to-day challenges. A Fan did a romantic (but cheating) letter to his dream girl by copying drama movies' tag lines into his love letter.

Funny, compelling and tickling your inner sense.",1117929600,,915,4.607361963190184
