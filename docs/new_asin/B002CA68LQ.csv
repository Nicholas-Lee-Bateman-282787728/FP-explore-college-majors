Our 9 year old grandson that has a ""movie"" collection asked if we could buy him a set for his ""personal"" collection.  Our 3 yr. old INSISTS on taking one or two to his babysitter every day and the babysitters daughter has not missed an episode of our set!  Excellent character building storys.

3905489,5,B002CA68LQ,"It came in the original packaging and had never been opened, so it was new.  After reviewing, found they were in mint condition.  The price was just great.  Minimal shipping to Canada if ask them to send it to UPS terminal or hub closest to you, if you are close to border like me.  As a church librarian, I am confident the junior children will enjoy the five videos in the set.
