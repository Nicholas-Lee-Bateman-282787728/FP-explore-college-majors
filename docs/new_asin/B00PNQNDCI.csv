6819452,4,B00PNQNDCI,"Having just watched this last night, I was torn between rating it three and four stars, and after waiting a day I decided on four stars.
I absolutely loved the main character - he seemed like a real person, with moments of pain from his past, and angst with certain people in the present. He had one of the most soothing voices I've ever heard - if he wasn't an actor, he would make an excellent counselor.

And the remainder of the cast did a fine job - the English always seem to add respectability in their roles.

As for the plot, for the most part I enjoyed it - it definitely was not the typical ""Enter a haunted house, act stupidly, and everyone dies"" story which has so often been repeated. My only complaint (and I know I'm not alone) is the latter part of the movie seemed to fall apart. The camera work was jerky, the lighting so dim that I could make out very little, and the bit I could see made no sense.

In spite of that, it was a very enjoyable movie overall. I would love to see this actor and character in more movies - he's not a superman, just a very charming, charismatic man, who would be wonderful to watch in other paranormal investigations.",1431043200,4,1166,4.266968325791855
6819453,3,B00PNQNDCI,"This movie was average. I thought the acting wasn't half bad & the plot was interesting. What i didn't like was how it jumped around a lot,it was limited on real scares which were low budget at best,the film quality wasn't that great & the more the movie went on the more confusing it got. Overall it was okay though.",1430352000,5,317,4.3
6819454,3,B00PNQNDCI,Not bad!,1435363200,,8,3.5
6819455,3,B00PNQNDCI,"This is an ok movie if you're into the found footage/paranormal investigation genre.  It's kind of slow and the people in it are pretty good, but the story was a bit hard to follow and the filming seemed cheap.",1434844800,,210,4.384615384615385
6819456,3,B00PNQNDCI,"Not bad, but the acting, a very important ingredient of any film could have been much better. When a meal doesn't have just one ingredient properly put in the meal, then, well, the meal will just not taste the way I would like it to taste is my basic analogy of how I thought this film could have been better.",1434412800,,309,4.166666666666667

6819461,3,B00PNQNDCI,A bit of a muddle really: some stumbling around in the dark and suggestive 'evil' spirits at the end.  Starts out with some narrative structure and a plot and characters that one can relate to.  It is low budget and that shows.  Neither good nor bad.,1432339200,,250,4.391304347826087
6819462,4,B00PNQNDCI,"I thought that ""The Casebook of Eddie Brewer"" was wonderfully worked out.... it is a fictional documentary, and the main character, Eddie Brewer, well-played by Ian Brooker is a likeable, vulnerable but serious paranormal investigator. He has maintained that, in spite of the current trend to do paranormal investigations in groups, doing the investigations by himself or with one other person, as he does, gets better and more honest, accurate results. One sub-theme is that others in the field, whether investigators or non-believers (openly) find his methods 'old-fashioned', and he becomes increasingly frustrated and disheartened through the course of the movie as his current investigation of two seemingly separate cases gets bogged down by others' deception and by the sudden intrusion of too many others. I don't want to go into too much detail, but I think it was well presented and without too much fuss.
The movie follows him, hand-held camera style, ostensibly making a documentary of the two cases, one a mother and her 10 year old daughter, who are being 'bothered' by some unexplainable activity, and the other an 18th century house that is in the process of renovation and (of course) is also experiencing some strange occurrences. As often happens when one renovates an old house.
The film is English. Being an Anglophile, I might be a bit biased, but I thoroughly enjoyed the way things developed - the pace, the very slow crescendo, the character development -particularly given the limitations of the situation - and the fairly understated music and sound, most of which fit nicely. (I particularly appreciated the bit from the Faure Requiem, 'In Paradisum', where it came in Eddie's journey...) The only complaint I might have would be with some of the choices that were made regarding lighting, and connected with that the choices about what to imply and what to show. I rather prefer not to be walloped over the head with various points (unless it's that kind of popcorn movie, but even then it's tiresome) but a wee bit more image in some of the scenes might have been nice. I understand, though, why a filmmaker would choose to keep the viewers in the dark, so to speak, up to a point. Anyway, I enjoyed it very much. It is relatively slow-paced, though and might not appeal to those who like to be walloped over the head (or need to be!)  There are some interesting points about paranormal investigation being made, or implied at least.",1431820800,,2463,4.934939759036145
6819463,3,B00PNQNDCI,"I always love a good thriller/ghost movie, but unfortunately, for me, this one fell short. I wish they had developed the main character, Eddie, a bit more and I also would've liked to see more of what exactly was happening with the ""little girl, Lucy""!
Not enough spooks and not enough suspense, but if you can get it free, go for it.",1431302400,3,334,4.403225806451613

8688880,4,B00PNQNDCI,"This was surprisingly good. I should make it clear that I'm a huge fan of the found footage genre and so I actually rate those types of movies fairly instead of automatically giving them one or two stars because I see that it's not shot in narrative perspective.

That being said, this movie is a mix of narrative and found footage style and though I usually don't like that, it worked well for this film. On top of that the main character Eddie Bauer does a great job of keeping your attention. His eccentricity, knowledge of science and extensive experiences in the paranormal field all come together to make for a character that's hard to dislike.

The movie's plot is shot under the premise of a local film maker wanting to do documentary on paranormal ghost hunters. Eddie agrees as long as the crew follows his rules.

From their the movie focuses on two ostensibly unrelated cases that Eddie is looking into and these two cases stick with us till the end of the film and both a major part of the overall plot.

The last part of the movie gets semi-intense and is a good time for those interested in paranormal movies. I should clarify that the last part, and the movie in general, isn't for those focused on getting their scares mainly from unexplained doors shutting and unknown noises from upstairs. Rather it's more for those horror fans that are all about a creepy and/or scary atmosphere which this movie achieves throughout until the climax.

All-in-all this was a very decent film in the genre. The acting is believable, the cinematography acceptable, the pacing done in a rhythmic manner and the plot intriguing. That being said, there will be those I would recommend to stay away from this film and that is those looking for jump scares back to back, huge production value in their scary movies or fast paced and gory horror, because the Case book of Eddie Bauer is none of those. It's a slow burn, with an interesting plot, great main character and intriguingly creepy atmosphere and for those who are into that, I recommend a definite rent or buy.

Note: I took off one star because the ending had a few issues for me that could have been easily addressed. This doesn't, by any means, make it unwatchable, and I just thought it would be good to include the reason for taking off one star.",1461110400,,2306,4.598540145985401

8688883,1,B00PNQNDCI,"I presume this is some British made for TV movie or something? I guess in that context it is passable, maybe for a really bored family to sit down and watch with their kids? But honestly, why not just watch Poltergeist or The Changeling instead?
 The acting was OK enough for most chracters, I believe the Eddie Brewer character was the best performance, but again, it was nothing to write home about, and they characters didn't stand out, don't terribly interest you, and will be easily forgotten.
 For a found footage film, this movie fails a few times in that it shows camera views from places where  there should not be a camera. That's rule number one of found footage film making.
The story is bland and hard to build enough interest to follow. Just think of it as one of those crappy Ghost Hunting shows on TV, but with a less annoying cast. And also, the build up takes for ever to get to, and there is absolutely no pay off; I'd never watch this again. It just amazes me that this one, like Paranormal Activity and Grave Encounters, are so highly recommended. It's like cash in horror marketed to gullible people who are afraid of their own shadow. I don't think I'd have even enjoyed this if I were a young kid.",1446422400,,1221,4.441964285714286
