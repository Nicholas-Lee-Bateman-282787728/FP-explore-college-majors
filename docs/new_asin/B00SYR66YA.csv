I watched it in Italian first when it was leaked. and then the day it released on Netflix in English. Hopefully, they'll release this on DVD for the U.S eventually. I mean it would only make sense since the series is licensed still to air here, and be sold on iTunes (I recommend) and Amazon digitally.",1484179200,,403,4.45945945945946
8699857,4,B00SYR66YA,"while I would like to see  it reach a region 1 release to own I was glad to be able to see it on Netflix.  Since this movie dealt with Tritanus I wasn't surprise that like his season in the series that it dealt with polluting the infinite ocean again.  what was surprising was how annoying the dubbed voices were.  I have the 4 kids release of the show not the recent re-release season set but from some of the reviews I read it sounds like the annoying dubbed voices was there too and makes me wish they had just subtitled the movie with the original Italian voices on the Netflix release of season 1 and 2.  I also think the CGI looks of the characters went a little down from the first two movies.  the first rate story about the team up of Winx enemies, the kidnapping of Skye and the general story plot and music makes up for a good deal of the flaws this movie has.",1452988800,3,871,4.124260355029586
8699858,4,B00SYR66YA,"Man has polluted the ocean and caused an imbalance which allows the evil witches or Trix to conspire to get control of the Infinite Ocean. The Trix kidnap Skye in order to get a pearl and free bad guy Tritannus. The Winx faeries  pull together to form a long rescue which include music and staying up with fashion.

I don't know who came first, Tinker Bell or the Winx, but someone copied. The faces of the Winx and Trix are all basically drawn the same with the real difference being in their color coded hair color. One of the nice thing about the Winx is that their dolls and market items didn't do well and have made their way to the discount aisle and places like Ollie's and Big Lots.

My 10 year old grand nieces are still into Winx, but are about to grow out of them. You could do worse.",1437782400,,795,4.217105263157895
