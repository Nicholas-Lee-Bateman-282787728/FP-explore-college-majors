8131098,3,B000GETULK,"this series seems to be a poor VHS to dvd transfer, its is really hard to read what is happening on the screen. I have played it on many dvd type programs on my pc and different DVD players(vlc,PowerDVD etc) and I cannot get the quality any higher the what it looks like to be 240p. the only saving grace about this series is that Alex says what he is going to do while doing it so you can listen to what he is saying and able to write it down. I would avoid this series if you are new to the Maya Dynamics scene, you will get lost quickly. I would give this a lower review solely based on the video quality being so bad but the content is good. it might be old but a lot of this topics covered is a must know for anyone who is into Maya VFX.",1515888000,,742,3.8562091503267975
