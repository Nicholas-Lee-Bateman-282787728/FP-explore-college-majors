8149464,3,B000JBXHW8,The price was right and the videos were pretty cute and funny but I am not a fan of DL Hughley.,1359072000,,95,3.5714285714285716
8149465,2,B000JBXHW8,"This disk is not worth the money.  Does not have closed captioning as promised.  Not a very good quality selection of clips.  Hosts did not impress me.  AFV, being one of the most successful programs ever, simply should be doing a much better job in composing its DVDs. This is my first negative review.",1344384000,,303,4.555555555555555
8149466,3,B000JBXHW8,"It's three shows.  The first one focuses on love and romance, and was never aired, and was hosted by a guy I've never seen in the on-air show.  The Love & Marriage DVD is funnier.  The other two episodes were $100,000 shows hosted by Daisy Fuentes and John Fugelsang.  I kept being distracted by their attempts to put Daisy Fuentes in sexy attire that somehow never fit her right, and her hair would never stay in place.  Overall the shows are good for a few laughs, but not the best DVD.",1241654400,2,488,4.318681318681318
8149467,4,B000JBXHW8,IM  VERY  USED  TO  AFV  ON  TV.  THIS  DVD  DEALS  WITH  ONE  SPECIFIC  TOPIC  AND  STAYS  WITH  IT.  I  ALSO  ONT  THINK  D.L.  HUGHLEY  WAS  A  GOOD  HOST  CHOICE FOR  THIS  SHOW.  ITS  ALMOST  AMAZING  TO  SEE  THE  FUNNY  THINGS  PEOPLE  REALLY  DO.  AND  ACTUALLY  WIN  $100000  FOR  DOING  IT.  MY  FAMILIES  DONE  SOME  PRETTY  FUNNY  STUFF  WHO  KNOWS  MABYBE  WORTHY  OF  $100000?????  IF  YOU  REALLY  LIKE  AFV  I SAY  GET  A  BOX  SET  INSTEAD OF  THIS  SINGLE  DVD.  ITS  WORTH  IT  IN  THE  LONG  RUN.,1195603200,,516,4.058139534883721
8149468,5,B000JBXHW8,"The ONLY thing wrong with America's Favorite
Home Videos is that if you see ANY 5 episodes,
you'll see SOMETHING 4-times; something else 3-
times; and, several things TWICE.
If they made a mega-set of ALL of the $100,000
year-end episodes, I'd buy it. The thing is--
even THEN... restart reading the first paragraph.
Now read it again, and again, and again, and again,
That said, I've GOT all of the episodes on DVD...
so far. Just do a MEGA-set... milk it for what it's
worth! Pretty soon people that AREN'T 60-years old
will figure out what I did... and I'm only 59!",1182988800,4,568,4.524271844660194
