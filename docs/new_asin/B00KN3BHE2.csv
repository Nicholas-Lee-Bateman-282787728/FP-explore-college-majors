8660239,5,B00KN3BHE2,"Jan is AWESOME!  I got the book and the DVD and use the exercises while at work to help relieve pain and stress. I like the DVD for the added visuals and instructions, its a great addition to the book. Either can stand on their own but I prefer them together and found they both helped me more than they could have along.  I highly recommend the DVD and book. I have had constant back pain from an injury I suffered over a decade ago and these exercises have really helped the pain. Because of my back injury I can't do a lot of traditional exercises, but I can do these and I feel tons better because of it. Highly recommend.",1408665600,5,626,4.1652892561983474
8660240,5,B00KN3BHE2,"We love this DVD.  We can do the whole thing or adapt it to our physical needs of the day.  After my husband sprained his ankle  he could do the  seated sun salutation adaption, until it healed and he could do the salutation with the chair as just a prop. We try to do 2 or 3 sections every day and are working up to do the whole thing.  Jan makes you feel good and helps you adapt as needed.",1408060800,,392,3.85
