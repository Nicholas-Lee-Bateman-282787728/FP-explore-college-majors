8479441,4,B005MKSMZI,"I had the pleasure to meet Mr. Dean in Studio City California some 9 years back.
A group of mine was looking to do a salute to the cowboys of the Silver Screen.
Had a nice long chat with Eddie. He was as elegant a gentleman at his late age
as he was on screen. He was a major contributor to What made the B Western
so great.",1380067200,,324,3.7794117647058822
