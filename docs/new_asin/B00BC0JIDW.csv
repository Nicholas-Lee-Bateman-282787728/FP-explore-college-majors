8565550,3,B00BC0JIDW,"This documentary has been well reviewed by the small number who have reviewed it so far.  I recently watched it (mistakenly, I guess, with an idea bssed on a sort of dust-jacket review, that it would be inspirational about the struggle of people for democracy and--more than that--for human rights.  Alas for that misconception.  The film portrays movements in Egypt, Malaysia, Ukraine, Venezuela and Zimbabwe.  If one were to pick 5 countries in 2014 which have had major reform movements, I think it would be a struggle to pick 5 places that have fared worse overall.

So if you watch it already prepared for a heavy dose of realism, you may like this film.  I do kinda wish they'd presented a little more detail about the history of the 5 countries, but that would probably have made it overly-long.  In general I've found movies with a tighter focus [The Island President would be an example] to be more interesting as they can take the time to include more of the history and background.

The version I got played just fine on my North American-standard set, and had English subtitles when the speakers were speaking in their native languages.  In fact I think it had a unique twist that I haven't seen before: if I recall correctly it is a semi-region-independent DVD.  That is, any region's DVD player will play it, but if you switch regions 5 times in playbacks, it won't switch again.  There are some extended interviews on the DVD; I didn't have time to view those yet [and I will].  Periodically quotes are included; my favorite two were the first, from Abraham Lincoln: If you want to learn about a man's character, give him power [or words to that effect] and the other was from Voltaire: ""It's dangerous to be right, when your government is wrong.""",1418083200,,1762,4.685064935064935

8565552,5,B00BC0JIDW,"For those of us who take freedom and democracy for granted, this film is a real eye-opener. It depicts the long history of violence, oppression and corruption in Malaysia, Egypt, Zimbabwe, Venezuela & the Ukraine and follows the stories of inspirational people who are leading the fight for true democracy and freedom in their countries, despite tremendous risk to themselves and those they love.  I was moved by the courage of others to stand up for human rights and never so grateful to be living in a truly free society.
A great history lesson we should all have.",1393891200,,566,4.775510204081633
8565553,5,B00BC0JIDW,"This powerful film takes a fascinating look at specific stories in five different, non-Western countries - Malaysia, Egypt, Zimbabwe, Venezuela & the Ukraine - to give us a deeply personal glimpse into the people behind the headlines and newsreels: the individuals who reached out and connected with others to inspire and make real change, using whatever means possible. ""A Whisper to a Roar"" is presented with a unique sensitivity and gives us a perspective that makes us want to learn more, and do more, in the very complex times we're living in.",1393891200,,548,4.967391304347826
8565554,5,B00BC0JIDW,"What is the cost for democracy? A Whisper to a Roar takes us through the journey of five battles in the Ukraine, Venezuela, Egypt, Malaysia and Zimbabwe as individuals, groups and countries fight to have their voices heard. Structured beautifully, clearly explained and visually compelling this is a must see educational documentary which should be taught/shown in all high schools.",1393891200,,382,5.383333333333334
8565555,3,B00BC0JIDW,"It is hard for me to review the DVD.....The name of the DVD on Amazon's description was in English so when I saw the ""Malaysian Subtitles"" as part of the name, I thought that the DVD would be in English with Malaysian Subtitles.  It didn't exactly make sense to me why Malaysian except that one of the revolutions covered was the revolt in Malaysia.

In fact the DVD was in a number of foreign languages with English included occasionally.  In the Product Description no language was included.  I ordered another copy, making sure that this time it was in English, and that Product Description stated that the language was English.  The review with the foreign version on Amazon was in English and the two reviews quoted: by Hilary Clinton and the NY Times, were also in English.  I was shocked to receive the DVD with everything on the cover and on the DVD in a foreign language.

I think that Amazon needs to make it clear what the Malaysian Subtitles edition is.

I can't be sure whether the two other editions were presented when I queried ""A Whisper to a Roar"", but if they were, I didn't see them the first time I brought up the title.",1383004800,,1141,4.478260869565218
8565556,5,B00BC0JIDW,"This story about the universal desire for democracy and the human price that is paid to attain it is as inspirational as it is informative.  How shocking the parallels are as we watch dictators from five countries betray the very people who believed they were liberators.  News footage from the Ukraine, Venezuela, Egypt, Malaysia and Zimbabwe is used to dramatize the common theme that when power becomes absolute, the result is catastrophic.  But the primary message of the film focuses on the courage of the oppressed to risk everything for liberty.  When we see how people risk their lives for the right to vote, it is a reminder of how many squander that right and often ignore the implications of complacency.

The gentle beginning is disarming and brilliant.  A parable reminds us of what we have long known: a hero becomes a dictator when power is absolute.  We know it, but when we see it evolve in the film, we feel the truth of it and the warning that it is a truth we must never forget.

Writer/director Ben Moses has once again found a powerful way to reveal the human side of history.  I will watch it again and recommend that you do, as well.",1367884800,5,1157,4.577669902912621
