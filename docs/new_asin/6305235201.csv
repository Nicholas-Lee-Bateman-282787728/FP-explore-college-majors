7886939,5,6305235201,"As a Scout Master I've collected quite a few ""survival"" videos over the years and the tapes the Hoods produce are far and a way the best I've seen. The material is presented in a clear and concise manner with a sense of humor that makes them fun to watch. My 11 year old girl walked by while I was watching one and sat down with me. After the video she asked me when we could go camping! I hate to say it but these video helped to bring our family together because she never wanted to go along before when I took her brother camping. Now we are going to order the rest of the set. Incredible buy and much better than a book for learning from.",987292800,3,642,4.0234375
7886940,5,6305235201,"Ron Hood and his wife Karen did a stupendous job on these high quality survival videos. Ron's sense of humor and knowledge of skills is extraordinary! I bought one set for myself and liked them so much that I ended up purchasing more for my friends and family. I was trained in the military and I know my stuff, but these videos teach so much useful information that I learned a whole bunch more. That's saying something. These videos are just a sampler of a whole set of survival videos that the Hoods produce. These producers are so good that their work has won awards for outstanding production. Highly recommended for all ages from boyscouts to military men like myself. Good work!!",987292800,2,686,4.631147540983607
7886941,5,6305235201,"As a survival instructor for the Colorado Division of Wildlife, I would highly recommend these videos to anyone who has an intrest in the outdoors. Dr. Hood goes well beyond any survival manual and shows you what really  works. He also teaches you small tricks you won't find in the manuals. His  style of instruction is very entertaining and very informative. He makes  the difficult, simple. I have purchased the series and entend to plug it  during the next D.O.W. Masters conference. Buy it, you won't regret it.

7886942,5,6305235201,"No survival video surpasses or even gets close to Ron Hoods. Very few survival books get close either. Very informative and fun videos to watch. Ron teaches with a no-bull,common sense approach. Don't be stupid,buy  them!!",937267200,3,222,5.166666666666667
7886943,4,6305235201,"This video shows many, very important survival tips. Most important of these are choice of shelter, starting a fire, purifying water, and putting together your own basic survival kits that are compact and easy to carry.  Ron Hood spells out the Rule-of-3s to provide you with wilderness survival  priorities. Although this video is fairly generalized in the area of  obtaining food, there is a web site and follow-up videos listed at the end  of the tape. The time taken to show you how to do the things discussed is  also a strong point in this series.",924566400,4,553,4.71875
