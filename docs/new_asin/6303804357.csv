713936,5,6303804357,"Without a doubt, this is the very best talking pig oriented film of the nineties to feature Louis Rukeyser.",1068940800,2,107,4.684210526315789
713937,2,6303804357,"Having been subjected to multiple viewings of Gordy during rainy days at a beach vacation, I now consider myself an expert on the movie. The main problem with the movie is the human acting, which is abysmal. Even the relatively highly touted Kristy Young seems to have serious problems with remembering and delivering her lines. The logic of talking animal movies is always suspect, but in this case there are serious problems. Why, for example, does a patriarch name the titular piglet to administer a company until the grandson reaches the age of majority? Even in pig years Gordy is a child too! The motivation of the movie seems not to be to discourage eating pigs but to promote the values embodied in the Branson brand of country music - relatively bland and harmless, to be sure, but not too well thought out. What do you do with the farm when the animals reproduce out of control?  So while the movie doesn't make too much sense, and the actors don't help convince you further, there is some amusement for children that are too young to think this through. My children were delighted by the mild dramatic tension and funny animal sounds and voices. I think this means that producers have free rein to create similar low-budget talking animal vehicles and they will be guaranteed an income, certainly from the video sales. Although thankfully there isn't a Gordy II!",1060560000,8,1373,4.76890756302521
713938,5,6303804357,"This clever live-action film tells the story of Gordy, a young talking pig who is left behind while his whole family is shipped off to be killed.  He sets off to rescue them and has some exciting adventures along the way.  There are some very sad and frighteningly intense scenes, especially at the slaughter house.  I recommend it for children 8 and up.  Adults will find it very enjoyable, too!",1024012800,4,396,4.614285714285714

713941,5,6303804357,"I saw ""Gordy"" about a couple of days ago on TV, and it was a really, really great film for the whole family! And I thought that it was a little bit better than ""Babe"", but ""Gordy"" does not make ""Babe"" a bad film, because it isn't. ""Gordy"" calls the attention to a little pig named Gordy who discovers that his family is missing and sets out to find them. In the process, Gordy meets some amazing, one-of-a-kind people along the way, including a country singer and his daughter (brilliantly played by both Doug Stone and Kristy Young). As fate would have it, Gordy becomes a worldwide sensation after becoming friends with a little boy he saved from being drowned. To me, I think that ""Gordy"" is just one of the best family films that Walt Disney Pictures have made since they did ""The Lion King"" and ""The Rocketeer"". ""Gordy"" has laughs, a great story, plenty of heart, and great music sung by Doug Stone and other talented artists. ""Gordy"" is, without a doubt, the BEST Disney film that I have watched in my life! A great addition to any video/DVD collection!",1003190400,3,1059,4.520833333333333

714101,5,6303804357,"The first time I saw this was during childhood. I used to have a VHS tape of this. But it eventually got destroyed as I threw it away. I never saw it again till I was 13. At that time I kept thinking of pork chops and fried potatoes and onions that my old respite provider used to make for dinner. I've been looking for this movie for a long time. This is a rare found for this has never been in stores. I was in a grocery store in Dallas and it was sitting in a shelf with the other movies. I asked the 20-year-old movie as a human ""Gordy? What are you doing here?"" At the time it was released, I was a 2 week old baby. I was watching Top 10 copycat movies and this film alongside Babe was ranked #5 on the list. The only things that are different from both movies are that in Gordy, a pig becomes famous after he rescued Hanky (which I find it's a ridiculous nickname.) He is referred to as ""Hero Pig"". During the whole picture, he does whatever he could to save his family before it's too late. In Babe, he was brought home to Farmer Hogget after a contest at the fair. Then he was trained to be a sheep dog and never saw his real mother or siblings ever again. I think Babe and Racing Stripes should be the real copycat movies because they both follow the same plot line. Whenever I write the quote ""Dietz, this is Brinks."", Microsoft Word suggested I change it to ""Dietz, and this is Brinks."" I now have my very own copy! I even remembered seeing it on Netflix. This movie looked like it's released in the United States alone. I say that because the narrator played by Frank Welker said ""Nestled in the heartland of America."" and later, Hanky said when he had the globe ""Here's the United States of America.""  But I went to another amazon website and this was also released in the United Kingdom. In a scene where Hanky & Gordy escaped the bus by using the emergency exit, they both manage to get out easily. In reality, whenever a person uses an emergency exit at the window, an alarm would go off and everyone (including the driver) would hear the sound and feel alarmed.",1437609600,,2078,4.221105527638191

714261,2,6303804357,"I actually tried really hard to like this movie, but this movie lacked the heart warming element of that other movie about a talking pig. A certain movie known as Babe. Babe was naturally heart warming, whereas this movie seems forced in that aspect. Why the comparison of both movies you wonder? Well both are about talking pigs, both came out the same exact year, and both came out 12 weeks apart. And interestingly enough Gordy came out before Babe did, but I never heard of Gordy until after Babe got advertised on TV. Yet Babe got all the praise and had more box office success than this movie did. Now why 2 stars instead of 1 you wonder? Well I will admit the pig who's Gordy is adorable and the part where he sets out to save his family gets points from me. But those are the only qualities of this movie I like. Everything else was forced, contrived, and cringe worthy. Parts such as Hanky the little boy being able to communicate with Gordy as if he's a human being, Hanky's mom ""modeling"", the pig rap song, the over saturation of country music, and the ""romance"" between Hanky's mom and Luke. I'd like this movie more if those 4 of the 5 aspects were kept to a minimum, but they stretched them too far. The only one of those aspects that was kept to a minimum was the pig rap song. To those of you who have seen Babe and not Gordy, you'll feel let down totally. And if anyone thinks this movie is better than Babe has to be out of their mind. There's a line on The DVD cover that says, ""The Talking Pig Who Made It Big!"" I'm sorry, but that line belongs to Babe. This movie should be known as The Talking Pig Who Has Nothing On Babe!",1313884800,,1645,4.24203821656051
714262,5,6303804357,"My kids (ages 2 and 5) love this movie! It is one of their favorites!  I have watched this movie many times with them and I actually enjoy it.  Sure the acting is horrible, but that only makes me laugh more and my kids enjoy me laughing along with them.  Do your kids a favor and watch this and laugh with them.",1271116800,5,311,3.9838709677419355
714263,5,6303804357,"Even as an adult, Gordy is one of my favorite movies of all time! I received it for Christmas as a kid, and while i had never heard of it at the time, i was thrilled with it when watching it. I love country music (my favorite kind) and i was just starting to get in to country music at the time, and was one of my favorite parts about it. Doug stone is sensational in his role as well as Kristy Young and the young man that plays Hanky. Both very smart and talented young actors. If you like this kind of movie, you will appreciate the Christian values (the hymn ""By and By [When the Morning Comes]"" can actually be heard by a congregation singing in a country church as Gordy makes his trekk off the farm) (the hymn is older, but it was acutlaly my first introduction to hymn from this movie), and also appreciate the cuteness of the pig and kids, the beautiful countryside (not sure if it was filmed in Arkansas), the fun of bad guys Brinks, Deets, Snipes, and Crudmen, and all the country music, even a musical number of ""Ya'll Come"" from Branson featuring Roy Clark, Moe Bandy, Mickey Gilley, Boxcar Willie, Jim Stafford, Buck Trent, and Cristy Lane. Doug Stone's real life hits and songs including ""More Love"", ""Dream High"" and ""Wishbone"" are presented superbly, as well as the Eddie Rabbitt/Crystal Gayle duet ""I Made A Promise"" and movie tune, ""Your Heart's On the Line"" by Kristy Young.

In response to a previous reviewer's comments, i hardley think that extremely-mild body part launguage in Kristy's song such as ""butt"" ""buns"" and ""fly"" are innappropriate for any 3 year old, much less a young woman of 12 to be singing about. (no crude sexuality impilied in the song). This movie is as  wholesome and as Christian-valued as it gets for kids. Just another reason i love it. This movie is outstanding for any country music lover, and is worth it to spring for even just for the music itself. In comparison, Babe is a more gentle-paced, drama like movie, while Gordy is more high-energy, line dance kinda groove with comedy, a little drama, and even a little love story. If you're looking for something that's fun, funny, and a toe-tapping good time (while not a well-known movie, it's not low budget either. The acting and filming is excellent quality), this is the movie folks!",1212019200,,2288,4.564476885644769
714264,4,6303804357,"A talking pig named Gordy becomes involved in a

fun-filled adventure to save his family members

from being turned into pre-packaged bacon and pork

roast at the local slaughterhouse.

It is a really cute and simple movie that would

be more enjoyed by younger children.",1152230400,,271,4.933333333333334
714265,3,6303804357,"In 1995 two pig movies arrived on the scene at the same time.  There was a funny movie called ""Babe,"" and then there was this movie.

In this pig of a movie, a pig called, wait for it...GORDY, has a lovely happy life on the farm, until one day he runs off on a search.  When he returns from his search, his family is GONE!  Pretty dramatic, ain't it?  Anyway, Gordy's family was sent ""up north,"" which is a euphemism for the packing plant, where the Gordy family will be turned into...okay, maybe I'll skip that part.

Gordy is off with the single-minded purpose of saving his family.  I will say that Gordy did focus on finding and saving his family.  Throughout this whole movie Gordy kept coming back to that, no matter where he was.

Gordy hardly sets off on his journey when he encounters Luke MacAllister (singer Doug Stone, who actually can sing), Jinny Sue MacAllister (Kristy Young, who actually can't sing), and Cousin Jake (Tom Lester, who some may remember as Eb Dawson on ""Petticoat Junction,"" ""The Beverly Hillbillies,"" and ""Green Acres"").  The trio is traveling country singers headed off to another singing engagement.  In fact, just after Jinny Sue meets Gordy hiding in the back of a truck, we get to see Jinny sue singing and leading a bunch of line dancers at a local dance hall.  I have no clue as to why we are focused on Jinny Sue other than to establish she's a red-blooded sweet American girl who does not sing very well.

After the distraction, we get back on the road, only Jinny Sue has now acquired Gordy as a pet.  At a singing gig at the governor's mansion we meet a whole cast of stereotypical characters, particular the wormy Gilbert Sipes (James Donadio, who had a very short acting career; after seeing this movie, I can see why), Jessica Royce (Deborah Hobart, who has appeared in a couple dozen movies and television shows), her son Hanky Royce (Michael Roescher, in his only role ever), and wealthy Henry Royce (Ted Manson, who has been in more than two dozen minor roles).  It turns out that Henry Royce is wealthy, and Gilbert Sipes has his eye on gaining the family fortune.

During the singing action, Hanky manages to fall into the mansion pool and is rescued by Gordy.  Hurrah for Gordy, the vaguely lovable pig!

Gordy is now on the fast track to stardom, becoming the mascot for Royce industries, and beating out Jessica Royce for popularity.  Gilbert Sipes tries to do away with the pig, and of course routinely fails thanks to Hanky and Gordy.

Eventually we get to Branson, Missouri, where Jinny Sue, Luke and Cousin Jake are performing with a number of really famous country singers:  Mo Bandy, Roy Clark, Christy Lane, Boxcar Willie, Jim Stafford, Buck Trent, and Mickey Gillie.  Henchmen of Gilbert Sipes try to do away with Gordy again, unsuccessfully, of course, and Gordy finally learns where his family is.  Of course, the family is on its way to, gasp, a grisly end, and Gordy has to get there in the nick of time.  Will he make it?  You will have to watch to find out.

There is no comparison between pig movies.  ""Babe"" took in an estimated $67 million dollars in US box office, and ""Gordy"" took in an estimated $4 million.  ""Babe"" won an Oscar, 17 other awards, and had another 16 nominations for other awards.  ""Gordy"" won one minor award.  ""Babe"" was nicely plotted and appealed to adults as well as children.  ""Gordy"" was unbelievable and hard to watch as an adult.

Children do seem to like this movie.  My children liked it, but I found it hard to keep watching to the end.  For adults, and probably for nearly anyone above the age of ten, this movie is just painful.  Disney had a miss with this movie.

I gave this movie three stars, which is very generous, because my children liked this movie.  If it has not been for their enjoyment of the movie, it would have gotten two stars.  Good luck!",1150502400,9,3860,4.548621190130624
