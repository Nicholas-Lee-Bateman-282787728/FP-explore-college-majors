8399997,1,B003M0XAPC,I have been anticipating the release of Game over. I recieved it on 11/26/2012. Upon opening the package I noticed the dvd had no protected wrapping. As I proceeded to open I noticed this was a dvdr which is not in the description. I immediately repacked and sent back for a full refund to say the least I was not happy!,1353888000,2,320,4.262295081967213
