1030755,4,6305438498,"Not as funny as the wedding of Hugo and Alice, but there are snippits of hilarity.  Too bad Simon turns out to be a real jerk.  The first episode  really touches upon the humanity of clergy and how one's needs get in the  way of what's better-off for the whole community. The wise man bit in the  second episode is down-right funny!  Alice shows some intellect, finally .  . . but one of her scatter-brained thoughts can only go so far.  Would  highly recommend this to all of us ""Vicar"" lovers.",967161600,,495,4.351648351648351

Dawn French leads the wonderful ensemble cast through alternately hilarious and quite poignant moments as only the English seem capable of doing.  The post credit scenes with the vicar (Dawn French) sharing a joke with her verger Alice Tinker (Emma Chambers) are comic jewels.  This is laugh out loud comedy playing both on wit and slapstick.  Intelligent and gentle humor with no vulgarity.,1417564800,,496,5.1625

I'd watch this show because it is hysterical, even if you couldn't hear, just watching their faces would make you laugh. The characters are all perfect. Love Dawn French as an actress and a writer. I'd watch anything she was remotely involved in because she is so funny in a genuine, healthy way (in this day and age when so many comediennes rely on pornography for laughs).",1403308800,,503,4.588888888888889
1031545,4,6305438498,"Most of the Church of England has accepted women's ordination by now, but I assume that the practice ruffled some feathers at first.

And it becomes a source of comedy in ""The Vicar of Dibley - The Complete Series 1,"" where a quaint little village ends up with a bawdy, busty woman as their new cleric. While the character of David feels Flanderized at times, it's a genuinely funny little show that doesn't get too preachy with its religious content... although it's too nice and friendly to become an English ""Father Ted.""

When the ancient Reverend Pottle expires during services, the people of Dibley are given a brand-new vicar: Geraldine Granger (Dawn French), who is very much female (""These are such a giveaway, aren't they?""). This initially shocks the parish council -- especially stuffy and wealthy David Horton (Gary Waldhorn) -- but her friendly , jokey approach to her job quickly endears her to the locals.

And she immediately has a bunch of problems to deal with, along with her dim-witted verger Alice (Emma Chambers) -- a BBC show about churches wants to film Gerry at work (as Alice struggles with a new Bible); a village festival that needs to be opened by a celebrity; a storm smashes a stained-glass window that they can't afford to replace; a political election that Gerry uses against David; and a controversial service to bless animals, which might wreck Gerry's reputation.

Thankfully, ""The Vicar of Dibley"" spends relatively little time preaching about what religion should be, although it lays it heavy on the political cliches (David is super-conservative, rich, fusty, a golfer and doesn't care about common people -- in other words, he might as well be a cartoon). Honestly, the story would have been just as entertaining had she been a man -- a bouncy, irreverent breath of fresh air surrounded by kooky village eccentrics.

About half of the comedy comes from Gerry and the hapless Alice, and the other half from the rest of the village council (consider Mrs Cropley, an elderly woman with strange cooking habits and a penchant for sex and nudity). Creator Richard Curtis and Paul Mayhew-Archer pepper it with lots of absurd situations and wacky, satirical dialogue (""Stop writing, Frank! 'Can't' isn't in the Christian Vocabulary!"" ""Yes it is! You can't commit adultery, you can't steal..."" ""You can't even covet your neighbour's ass. Even if it is very alluring!"").

And amidst all the comedy, they manage to put in some heartwarming stuff, like the burgeoning romance between Alice and David's equally-dim son Hugo. And the conclusion to the whole stained-glass-window debacle is rather touching, as is the whole situation with the animal-blessings.

One thing that hasn't aged well is the pop culture/sociopolitical references. As I was a young child in the early nineties, I was forced to google many of the the then-contemporary references just to figure out who they were talking about. It kind of kills the jokes.

The central role was made for Dawn French, and it shows -- she steals every scene with robust fervor and sly irreverence, but you can see that Gerry is a genuinely kind and pleasant person. And she plays well opposite the various actors, especially Chambers as the dippy Alice (who never understands jokes, and goes into long rants about I Can't Believe It's Not Butter). And then there's Trevor Peacock as a weird guy who prefaces everything with ""nononono..."", Liz Smith as a raunch old lady, Roger Lloyd-Pack as a farmer with a lovely voice and dodgy colon, and so on.

As mentioned before, David is presented basically as a Labour political cartoon, and doesn't develop much depth until the final episode. It's a little jarring, because the rest of the characters are depicted as pretty neutral sociopolitically.

""The Vicar of Dibley - The Complete Series 1"" is a fun, frothy little Britcom, especially for anyone who enjoys religious comedy and/or Dawn French. I just wish I understood half the pop culture references.",1403136000,,3982,4.983433734939759

I found some of the cultural references from England in the 90s to be beyond me, and case in point, I thought I heard the snooty character David Horton complaining that he wanted to get rid of the ""church virgin"". I did not believe my ears. So after some googling I found, in the Anglican, Episcopalian and maybe Catholic churches too, there was something called the Church Verger, something like a volunteer.

This show has humor and sweetness, and a funny cast of silly characters. After the credits of each show, you have to hang around to watch Gerry tell a joke to Alice. Alice can't be as dumb as she acts, so she has to be a great actress! Just her ability to remember and recite her theory on ""I can't believe It's Not Butter"" shows that's she actually intelligent!",1390003200,,650,4.371900826446281

After a typically crazy Council Meeting, the members outvote the Squire to give Vicar ""Gerry"" a chance to preach one sermon. Of course, most of the citizens come to her service out of curiousity, so suddenly seeing a full church is certainly much more impressive than the past turn-outs of 4-6 people!  Vicar Geraldine preaches a sermon that keeps everone involved. The council then votes that she can stay. The actors and the writers of this BBC series pulled-out all the stops to create a cast of very unusal villagers that Gerry must deal with every day. I love her sweet but very confused assistant,Alice; then there is the very graphically outspoken farmer, Owen; and the sweet, but shy & bumbling Squire's son, David, who is secretly in love with Alice.

Dawn French plays the vicar with just enough occasional naughtiness to make her entirely human, yet with a constant gentle affection for her parishioners that conveys the real message - that the greatest gift of the spirit is love.  This is one of my very favorite of the many excellent British comedies.",1383436800,,449,4.973333333333334

The final episode of the season (""Animals"") is a 5 star for me.  If you like the English sense of humor, it's well worth your time to check out this little gem of a show.

But for those who are very sensitive about their religion, I can see where some of the humor might be cutting a little close for them.  If this describes you, you might not like this.  However, I thought it put a very human face on the position of a vicar, and I strongly suspect that the Vicar of Dibley says what a lot of vicars actually think!

I can watch a lot of comedies and never really laugh.  I don't know if it's the type of humor or if I just don't, in general, have a good sense of humor.  But this one catches me off guard and I'm guffawing in minutes (as do several of the other British comedies - maybe I'm just an Anglophile at heart).

1032268,5,6305438498,"My wife and I came across this show by accident years ago. We were on vacation, switching around the TV stations, and came across ""Vicar"" playing on a local PBS station in Orlando. We were there for two weeks, and we liked the first episode we saw so much that we made sure to tune in the second week also. We came home and looked for it on our local schedule, but as far as we know it has never been shown in our home area.

So we happened to look for a DVD set and were delighted to find that all the seasons, specials, and follow-up specials were available. We bought them all.

We haven't played these shows in a few years, and tonight I decided it was about time for a reprise. Season One of course shows how a female Vicar came to be assigned to the small village, and introduces the odd, amusing, and lovable village folk. Pay special attention in episode two, where a bible is introduced to the church in an old printing style where ""f"" is used for the letter ""s"". This comes into play near the end of the show. You'll also enjoy the bit at the end of each show where the Vicar tells her helper a joke. I won't say more but the comedy in those scenes extends far beyond the joke itself.

Dawn French could not have been more personable and funny as the Vicar foisted upon a town with old fashioned values, or at least so they thought. She is convincing as a woman both committed to her church and community, and feeling the pull of a normal life at the same time.

There are a few jokes in the series that you might not get unless you are both British and familiar with British pop culture from the years when ""Vicar"" was filmed. Despite missing out on those few jokes, there are plenty more to fill each episode with chuckles and outright laughter.

Highly recommended.",1373673600,,1778,4.264094955489615

U.S. comedy is geared toward the ""immediate satisfaction"" crowd for the most part - the bulk of British comedy (and it's enduring following) lies in silliness built over episodes and seasons.

A note about the boxed sets...make sure all the seasons and the Specials are included.  For instance, the second series contains the two specials produced after the last season, for some odd reason.  The Specials both belong after the final season if you are looking to watch them in order. Cheers!",1369958400,,819,5.044444444444444

1032569,4,6305438498,"I watched this season of ""The Vicar of Dibley"" after watching the ""Father Ted"" series.  The Brits seem to like sitcoms about religious figures.  ""Father Ted"" has a lot more slapstick than ""The Vicar of Dibley.""  Whereas both have the usual British irreverent humor, ""The Vicar of Dibley"" also includes more touching and reverent moments.  ""Father Ted"" is straight-up irreverent with the priest doing very little priest work.  Geraldine Granger (Dawn French) is actually seen conducting services and is portrayed as a very competent vicar although very progressive and not adverse to off-color remarks.  Father Ted, in contrast, seems to have little respect for his profession.  While ""Father Ted"" has more laugh-out-loud moments, ""The Vicar of Dibley"" also has its moments, but is not quite as in-your-face.  Actually most of the funniest lines are delivered by the straight man in the show--no nonsense, perennial party-pooper David Horton.  But even he is sometimes sentimentally touched by the Vicar's nontraditional ideas.  It also has running gags like the agricultural humor in the opening, the jokes between the Vicar and Alice after the credits, and Jim Trott's ""No, no no no no.""

""Arrival""--The 102-year old Reverend Pottle dies at the end of a dry, boring sermon to a handful of parishioners.  The Chair of the Dibley Parish Council, David Horton, wants a replacement who is younger and will shape things up to his conservative tastes.  He is surprised to meet the new Vicar who is a self-described ""babe with a bobcat and a magnificent bosom"" who has more progressive ideas for the church.  Good episode, but the scene about taking notes on the council dragged a bit.

""Songs of Praise""--St. Barnabas is chosen for the BBC religious program ""Songs of Praise.""  The opening council meeting is very funny in this one.  Both the Vicar and David fall for BBC employees.  It is kind of weird seeing the Vicar googly eyed over a man.  The collar she wears always makes me think of a priest, but she is a Protestant Vicar and can marry.  The ending to this episode is classic.  I also like David's line, ""Most of them [employees of the BBC] are so homosexual they make John Inman [Mr. Humphries from ""Are You Being Served?""] look like Jean-Claude Van Damme.""

""Community Spirit""--The Vicar wants to bring in more money from the Autumn Fair and becomes starry eyed when she finds out Alice's cousin is Reg Dwight (aka Elton John).  Then she discovers he is just a bloke named Reg Dwight.  No worries, another celebrity saves the day.  Favorite line: ""If you do this, no matter what you do on earth: sex, drugs, ritual Satanism, I can get unto you the best seat in heaven.""

""The Window and the Weather""--There's a storm sparking a dialogue at the council meeting about past great storms which dragged a bit until David popped in with a sarcastic quip.  The stained glass window, however, was not saved as it was smashed by a tree.  The Vicar tries to get the money for a replacement window from one of David's wealthy investor friends who looks quite a bit like Bryan Ferry (hubba, hubba).  The ending is quite touching.

""Election""--The council meeting at the beginning of this episode with the note recorder reading in shorthand is hilarious.  David Horton is running as the incumbent for the district council but is out for his own interests (i.e. a golf course and travel) rather than the interests of the community (i.e. buses).  The Vicar is out to change that.

""Animals""--The Vicar gets the idea to hold a sermon where animals are allowed in the church.  David believes she's finally lost it and tries to get her fired.  With the tabloids after her and her job on the line, the Vicar begins to have doubts herself.  I thought this storyline was a bit far fetched even for this show, especially when the skinhead arrives with the dog named Satan.  Still, it was handled well at the end and even David was impressed.",1324252800,2,3926,4.8059701492537314

It is great to have the series on DVD so when in the mood it is right there for the watching and enjoying.  The product was shipped quickly and in perfect condition.,1293667200,,459,4.170454545454546

It's as if she were trying to explain alternate side of the street parking to a cranberry. There's an ensemble feeling to this series that extends beyond professionalism. The actors seem to really enjoy each other. If you are easily embarrassed by scatological jokes, or don't happen to enjoy Monty Python, you might not enjoy this series. I do wish that there had been a bonus take that explained how the series came to be or that showed the actors interacting on set.",1278806400,,677,4.603305785123967

The last show in this series was very touching, something I didn't expect since the first few shows of the series seem to be mostly just humorous rather than more serious in nature.

This is one of the best series that the BBC has ever produced and it is a shame that it didn't continue longer than it did.

While not as dry humored as shows like Are You Being Served or Ab Fab, both of which I love, it is a show in their league.  Dawn French gives a funny and humanizing performance as a vicar in the small town of Dibley...a town that has all of the posterchildren for for weird and wacky small town stereotypes. Yet it is a lovely show.  I would gladly go to church again if she was my vicar.

Do not be fooled though, while some of the humor is innocent, there are adult themes in this show, just like a lot of European television programing...so it may not be something for the kids to watch.  Also, while they do deal with religious themes, it is not a religious show...all positives for me, but just an FYI to any newbies thinking that it is a Christian show.  At its best, it is a show that proves compassion and humanity are the truths we should follow, and at worst, there is some really funny adultish humor.

Love you Dawn!!!!!!!!!!!!",1208131200,3,997,4.243386243386244

This is British comedy at it's best. Dawn French stars as a small town Anglican Vicar, Geraldine (Gerry) Granger. She comes to Dibley to replace the last Vicar who died. The Parish council is expecting a man but is taken by surprise when they find trhat their new Vicar is a woman. The Head of the parish council wants to have her removed but the rest of the council votes to give her a chance. The show revolves mostly around the Vicar & the parish council & the less than ""sharp"" Alice who helps the Vicar. The cast of characters is funny & delightfully diverse. I have watched this a lot since I got it & it never fails to make me laugh. It like most British comedies is far superior to most American comedies.

The program handles its religious theme lightly but with a good heart, highlighting the ability of the church at its best to reach out with love and acceptance (even as some on the council would take a more circumscribed view).  The supporting cast is composed of a delightful assortment of talent, with each actor taking full advantage of their character's pecularities.

1032690,5,6305438498,"THE VICAR OF DIBLEY finally makes it to DVD, with the hilarious first season.  Join Dawn French & Co. for six superb episodes of the BBC comedy hit written by Richard Curtis (FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL).
Welcome to Dibley, filled with some perfectly-peculiar characters like Letitia Cropley (Liz Smith), Frank Pickle (John Bluthal), Jim Trott (Trevor Peacock) and Owen Newitt (Roger Lloyd Pack).  Governing Dibley with an iron fist and a sealed wallet is snooty David Horton (Gary Waldhorn) and his young dimwit son Hugo (James Fleet).  Last but not least is the truly-terrifying Alice Tinker (Emma Chambers), the resident verger of the church.
""Arrival"" - After the 102-year-old Reverend Pottle carks it, the town of Dibley awaits its new vicar for St. Barnabus Church.  When the totally-unexpected Reverend Geraldine Boadicea Granger (Dawn French) arrives in town, no-one is prepared for what is to follow.
""Songs of Praise"" - Geraldine discovers that the BBC wish to film an episode of 'Songs of Praise' at the local church.  There's only one problem:  there's no choir.  Whilst Gerry and Alice quickly arrange auditions for the prospective choir, the rest of the town quickly starts becoming stage-struck...
""Community Spirit"" - With the annual Autumn Fayre looming, Gerry decides to get some more publicity for the event by getting a big celebrity to open it.  An idea more easily said than actually achieved.  When Alice casually mentions she has a long-lost cousin called Reg Dwight, Gerry puts two and two together and thinks she is referring to Elton John...
""The Window and the Weather"" - A big storm, arguably the biggest the town has ever known, has destroyed the beautiful stained-glass window of the church.  While the jury's still out on what Biblical scene the window actually depicted, Gerry decides to canvas all the rich people she can for donations to get a replacement.
""Election"" - David Horton and Gerry find themselves competing in the local elections, and two guesses who everyone is voting for...
""Animals"" - Unwittingly, Gerry finds herself performing a mass for all the animals of the village.  When the national press gets wind of the event, Gerry starts thinking twice about her actions...

In these delightful episodes, Alice and Hugo return from their rather traumatic honeymoon, Geraldine romances David's suave if overly tall brother, and the villlagers decide to participate in a live nativity, with Herod (played by David) as a kind, misunderstood soul. Some moments to watch for include Alice's sex appeal advice to the Vicar, Geraldine's new kitchen accomodations, and Jim/Frank's utterly eccentric interpretations of the costumes of the three kings...but don't fear, there are far more dramatic surprises in store!",1041206400,2,714,5.327433628318584

This is the fourth volume in the series, and it consists of three 30-minute episodes.  Those who've enjoyed the first three volumes will not want to miss this one, which culminates in Hugo and Alice's wedding--an event not to be missed, while romance appears to be ""in the air"" for the Vicar as well.
The first two episodes are absolutely hilarious too (as always).  Firstly, in ""Dibley Live,"" Dibley gets its own radio station, which has everyone eager to host his or her own show and results in a very interesting on-air revelation by one of the parishoners.  The upshot of Radio Dibley is newfound (albeit not entirely welcome) fame for the Vicar and her parish in ""Celebrity Vicar.""  Most hilarious of all, however, is the talent show, which has the Vicar donning a tutu and one of her parishoners doing his version of the full monty!

Dawn French is nothing short of brilliant as Geraldine Granger and the wacky natives of Dibley are the perfect compliment to her level-headed, straight shooting and compassionate vicar. Of special note is Emma Thompson who is note perfect as the sweet but dimwitted Alice Tinker, and Roger Lloyd Pack as Owen (bugger!) the lonely, cynical and hysterical farmer! The rest of the cast is outstanding as well and have such fantastic comedic timing and rapport from episode 1 that they seem to have worked together for years prior to the series. Choosing a favorite episode is particularly difficult considering the top-notch quality of the show, EVERYTHING about ""The Vicar..."" works, from the writing, acting and lush direction, to the priceless interchange between Geraldine and Alice during the closing joke segments. I do have one favorite closing, you know the one when Geri tells her weekly joke to David Horton (the superb Gary Waldhorn) and he looks her in the eyes sincerely and says simply 'stay'. It's a beautiful, genuine moment that closes a classic episode in which Geri struggles with a decision to leave the village after marrying Alice and Hugo. All of this has been my roundabout way of saying, for great comedy, British or otherwise, ""The Vicar Of Dibley"" is the best you'll ever find.

1032775,5,6305438498,"When reviewing the first four tapes of ""Vicar"" I pointed out that all twelve episodes were much of the same thing: the best comedy you're likely to find anywhere. It has taken a year for me to get my hands on these latest two tapes and I have to admit that I was a little apprehensive: could that quality have been maintained? The grateful answer to that is an unqualified ""yes"". Unlike many series, this one has not taken a nosedive.
Having said that, I have to point out that it is not exactly ""much of the same thing"". The differences are subtle (or I think they are), but very much in evidence. Formerly the characters who inhabit the magical, mad villiage of Dibley were eccentric (and that is a subtle understatement), but in these last four episodes (i.e. volumes five and six) they become more and more absurd. Is it at all likely, for example, that Alice might suddenly speak fluent Hebrew and indulge in a tirade about implied homosexual rape? Would even Owen seriously consider juggling with live babies? What about Frank's increased references to his own homosexuality? And as for Jim's outfit for one of the Kings in the Nativity ...
These questions do not in the least take away from the hilarity of the series. Quite the contrary: they add an absurdist twist which induces the kind of hysterical laughter that forces one to stop the video for a while, just to calm down before the next onslaught. In so many ways these absurdities help to save the situation from becoming dull and predictable (although there are one or two really predictable jokes).
A must for devoted fans, newcomers might prefer to watch the first four tapes before embarking on these latest ones. I suspect that a knowledge of the characters is necessary, were one to make sense of all the madcap goings-on.",975283200,38,1793,4.659305993690852
1032776,5,6305438498,"When Christmas rolls around, it seems that every television show wants to produce a holiday-themed episode.  Unfortunately, most are tired retreads of Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"" or O. Henry's ""Gift of the Magi"".
Not so, VICAR OF DIBLEY.  Instead of going for these obviously derivative storylines, the ""Winter"" episode takes its cue from a much less comically rich source: the book of Matthew.  Somehow, this tape finds a way to tread between high Christian tradition and human foible--and still be very, very funny.  Like every episode of the series, there is humor to be found pretty much everywhere in the fine ensemble cast, but most is derived from the interaction of the long-suffering but gentle Vicar Geraldine and her confidently dimwitted gal pal, Alice.  Some of the humor here, too, will be familiar to anyone who's ever had to organize a church or school play using less-than-Oscar-winning actors.
Wihout giving away the clever plot, it's fair to say that this episode works on at least two levels.  For the family looking for a new holiday story that is respectful of Christian tradition, yet emblematic of the modern Church of England/Episcopal Church, this is definitely your gig.  It's also a great buy for lovers of character-based British comedy, Christmas-themed or no.
That being said, it should be noted that some more conservative Christians may well challenge the notion of female church leadership (even though it's a fact of life in the C of E), and will balk even more at the other episode on the tape, in which the Vicar enjoys, then regrets, a pre-marital affair.  Though there's really nothing on a sex or violence scale to offend in ""Winter"", some parents may wish to preview the tape before letting their children watch it.  Non-Christians may not want to expose their children to a story so obviously steeped in Christian tradition.
Of course, from my perspective, there's nothing that children need to be shielded from here, especially in the Christmas episode.  The series is not afraid to make strong statements of faith, but it doesn't do so didactically.  impressively, Geraldine's humorous, but firm, defense of Christmas as ""the greatest story ever told"" is a fine example of how to live one's faith--whatever It might be--with joy.",973382400,16,2274,5.037333333333334
