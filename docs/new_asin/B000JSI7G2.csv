2678960,5,B000JSI7G2,"this is a great live dvd, band members are in great form, giving the best of their selves.
song selection is great, all songs which are included are classics.
after all these years i think Obituary were back from a frozen state. Full of energy, ready to blow our brains:)",1194652800,,271,4.44
2678961,5,B000JSI7G2,"First Obi DVD, a must have for a true fan. Recorded in Poland, august 2006. A special surprise for me: Donald's drum solo live in Bucharest (Romania), a great show that I have witnessed.

2678962,4,B000JSI7G2,"Great concert, just awesome performance captured in such high quality. The extras though are a let down. The promo videos from Frozen In Time album (a great come back album) are uninspired basic stand up performance mimics. Then the interviews were BAH! Come on ask some interesting questions, instead we get ""How did you guys think after completing 'Slowly We Rot""? Duh! they were stoked! Come on get on a deeper level. Then the generic backstage footage. BORING! Come on guys liven it up, drink from a keg, do something wild. NO! We see footage of the bass player before or after a show changing clothes standing in his underwear looking dumb. NOT what I envision Obituary as or want to see.

For a great concert highly recommended!",1180051200,,734,4.734375

2678964,5,B000JSI7G2,"The 1st Obutuary DVD and does it slay or what?? Killer setlist with some great camerawork. The MetalMind DVDs have really improved a whole lot since they started out a few years ago!!! Gone are the bad audio recordings. Great buy, highly recommended!!",1173312000,2,251,4.8604651162790695
2678965,5,B000JSI7G2,"pro shot, everything sounds great, over 20 songs, definitely Obituary at there best. I would highly recommend this for any death metal fan especially any Obituary fan.",1172361600,3,167,5.222222222222222
2678966,5,B000JSI7G2,"Tremedous job on this DVD - sound is just pulverizing in 5.1!!  Separate interviews with Don/John and  Trevor/Frank are awesome too - really interesting to hear their thoughts on each record and their 20 year career.  Makes you really appreciate these guys.

I love Obituary athough I'm not a death metal fan, and this DVD is highly recommended to anyone into crunchy riffs and brutal grooves.  So much to get into here.",1168992000,3,420,4.777777777777778
2678967,5,B000JSI7G2,"If you thought the albums were awesome, you won't believe how faithful they are in concert. I've never heard a band so exacting and so powerful as Obituary. So many other vocalists strain to mimic Tardy, and he just belts it out 100%, never falters or takes the easy way out, and performs with passion and a sense of pure, dark confidence that no one else can match. The whole band are masters at their art.

Finally I'll have a full concert recording!! But I'll still fly out wherever I have to when my schedule permits, to see you guys live.",1167955200,8,543,4.376237623762377

8152836,5,B000JSI7G2,"be certain you get the 2 disc version cd & dvd live set,23 obituary classic tracks live and some neo-classic from the amazing Frozen in Time(to me this cd feels like it should have been made after the end and around World Demise with some back from the dead style).
this live dvd/cd is proof that the yare live undead and kicking a*s still after  long hiatus they are back brutal as ever! must have!",1414800000,,399,4.32
8152837,5,B000JSI7G2,"There are two versions of this DVD and this one costs more for a reason.  This version comes with a CD of the performance and this is the only way that I am aware of to get this CD.

The version without the CD is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frozen-Alive/dp/B000JSI7G2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frozen Alive</a>.  This one costs considerably less, so be sure to choose it if you don't want the CD.

I would actually give this a rating of 4.5 stars, as the performance is spot on and excellent, but the stage presence (specifically Allen West) is lacking. Allen West seemed a bit bored and didn't have any real presence, but his performance was spot on. The band covered a lot of territory in a show lasting about an hour and twenty minutes.

The sound quality is EXCELLENT and it is mixed extremely well throughout the performance. The audio seems to be a 100% soundboard recording with no ambient microphones, so the audience response is very low in the mix. This is good and bad, as it takes a bit of energy from the performance in that the crowd doesn't sound loud and excited although they are. If I would have changed anything about this mix, I would have staged stereo ambient mics to capture the audience response. This doesn't take much away from the show, as the performance is what matters in the end.

Track listing:

1. Intro: Rain
2. Redneck Stomp
3. On The Floor
4. Insane
5. Chopped In Half

Bottom line: Highly recommended!",1368489600,,1771,4.70873786407767

8152841,5,B000JSI7G2,"If you don't believe so, then just watch this DVD. Obituary have been one of my favorite bands since ""Cause Of Death"". So there is no need to question this review. I saw them back in '92, and each member of the band was so cool. Donald (the drummer, duh) was kind enough to give me and my friends a free poster for their ""The End Complete"" album, and got each member of the band to sign it. I also got pictures of each member of the band. I have THAT VERY poster framed, with each of their individual photos of me and the band still to this day, since way back in '92. If you're not a fan of Obituary, then you are not a fan of death metal. LONG LIVE OBITUARY!!",1206057600,,661,3.9774436090225564
