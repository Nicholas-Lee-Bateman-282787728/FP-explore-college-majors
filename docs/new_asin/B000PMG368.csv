8192504,4,B000PMG368,This DVD I say could be better.  What the father talks about I think we all know already. many of us take it al ready into practice.  Too short time.  He needed to get into deeper spirituality.,1362096000,,193,4.162162162162162

8192506,2,B000PMG368,"I had hoped to have an introduction to Saint Ignatius, his time and cultural setting, his theological perspectives and so forth. Instead, we have a very nice priest who leads us on something approximating an Ignatian retreat, except not at all. An actual Ignatian retreat, at least according to the Exercises, consists of a minimal amount of introduction of subject matter. This admittedly pretty nice man is doing a lot of rambling, and very little of it seems geared toward leading the listener into spiritual experience.

From a technical stand point, the production could use some help. The sets are a disaster, in that at one moment we have a lake right next to the little cabin, and in the next lecture, we've got a mountain range in the same place! Furthermore, the cabin is a little ridiculous to look at. I kept expecting something from a Jim Henson production to show up. The opening theme is trite and relatively shallow, and excessively long.

But what is really a disappointment is that it doesn't really lead you in an Ignatian retreat experience (which is probably something a video could not possibly do), nor does it really inform you about an Ignatian retreat experience or the theological themes with which Ignatius worked (which a video could certainly do). Instead, it is a series of homilies on themes that are significant to Ignatius - not an informative presentation about these themes, but the priest's own approach to them through lengthy sermons. He is an okay speaker, but I really wasn't looking for a sermon series. I wanted a class on Ignatius. Perhaps my expectations were too high.

If you are looking for a contemporary sermon series on themes significant to the Spiritual Exercises, this may be exactly what you are looking for. If you desire to take your academic learning about Ignatius deeper, steer clear of this. There are excellent commentaries out there - find on of them. This is most certainly not that.",1288569600,8,1947,4.858433734939759
8192507,5,B000PMG368,"Awesome lectures on how to pray and meditate on God, Jesus, and the world.  This is old school (as in medieval), hardcore Christian spiritual battle training.  Although Father Gawronski throws in a few heart warming tales of his spiritual journey, this is NOT new age, wishy washy, I'm ok you're ok, ego message therapy!  The lectures are so true to the teachings of Saint Ignatius that Non-Catholics (and some Catholics) may be scandalized by the rather harsh uncompromising tone of the presentation.  Humility, sacrifice, the willingness to be brought low, all those un-fun things that make the spiritual path so hard are addressed with a clarity and honesty that is at times incredibly uplifting, but at other times very scary.  It's a very valuable resource for those looking for a way to better live in accordance with God's will.",1214092800,31,835,4.9784172661870505
