8483690,5,B005QROU12,"Sparro Productions and Shirley Frimpong-Manso are setting a fine example of how African films are supposed to be. The sound, camera and story direction are all on point, especially when compared to a lot of African films that have one scene loud/pitchy and another scene barely audible. The realistic acting by the cast members and camera lighting and direction also make for a tolerable viewing experience. The drama or ""Wahala"" as it is termed, is very alive and well in all three of the chapters, with any viewer wanting to know what's to come next. I just can't wait for Amazon to sell all the chapters, as I've read, this is a ten-part series. Go team Sparro!",1323129600,2,664,4.683760683760684
