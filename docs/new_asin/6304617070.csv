7875004,5,6304617070,"I used to watch Pryor's Place when it came on during the 1984-1985 Saturday Morning season. This was one of my favorite programs! This video features two episodes from the series.

In the first episode, Little Richie Pryor and his friend Wally must do a book report on Tom Sawyer for school. They're convinced that reading is boring and they first try to stay up until three a.m. to watch the movie but they both fall asleep! The next day, they work for the local bookstore to earn copies of ""Nick's Notes,"" so they won't have to read the book. However, Bummer tricks little Richie into reading the book and the boys find out just how much fun reading can actually be.

In the second episode, Henry Winkler guest stars as himself. He is teaching the kids on the playground about the dangers of talking to strangers. Richie notices one little girl, Amanda, who is acting a little weird. When she darts off the playground, Richie follows her. He learns that Amanda is hiding a terrible secret and turns to Mr. Winkler for help. Amanda soon learns that all secrets shouldn't be kept and should be told to someone you trust.",1113264000,5,1120,4.567164179104478
