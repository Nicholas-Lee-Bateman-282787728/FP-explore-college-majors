3610995,4,B001GFAMP6,"Everything arrived in good shape, except for the box containing Seasons 3 and 4.  There was a small dent / break in the box in the lower center of the back of it.  I didn't feel like returning the item, and waiting to get a new one, because I wasn't that worried about box aesthetics, but, it was a pretty serious hole... it was small, but went almost all the way through the box.  Besides that, I received exactly what I thought I was getting.",1289779200,,444,4.2

3611008,4,B001GFAMP6,My 12 year old daughter loves this show.  The only issue is that it did not include the very first season with Ms Bliss (Hayley Mills),1426464000,,134,4.153846153846154

3611010,3,B001GFAMP6,"Whoever was in charged of the authoring and encoding of the DVDs either did not use good quality discs or the encoding was done incorrectly because my Season 1 Disc 1 is pixelated so much that I could not see the disc completely and had to miss out on at least half of the episodes.  I played the disc on 2 different blu-ray players and in both of them the same thing happened, so I know it's not the player.  The rest of the discs are ok so far.

Even worse, the opening sequences of each season do not match and the ""Good Morning Miss Bliss"" episodes are not included.  Some episodes are placed out of order, for example: the ""Malibu Sands"" episodes are placed sequentially, but in between regular episodes, which means you see one ""Malibu Sands"" episode, followed by a regular episode, then another ""Malibu Sands"" episode.  Even if the episodes were placed in the correct order according to air date, many times it happens where an episode is aired out of sequence, which can be fixed when transferring them to physical media.

Another thing that could have been included in this set was the made-for-tv-movie of ""Hawaiian Style"".  Aside from those things, the experience of reliving Saved by the Bell is there, except for the commercials (thank God).  I would recommend getting ""The Complete Series Set"", which is more recent.",1424649600,,1330,4.6781115879828326
3611011,2,B001GFAMP6,This was what we were looking for but it doesn't really start with season one. It actually started at season two.,1423958400,,113,4.428571428571429

3611014,1,B001GFAMP6,"Saved by the Bell was one of my favorite shows back then and I was very disappointed when the same episode i tried watching multiple times kept skipping and freezing on me so i gave up trying to finish it. Also, when i place the dvd in the player, sometimes it goes to the menu and sometimes it plays straight to the episodes. Not all episodes will play from the episode menu so it would skip. Very frustrating when i was so excited to get this and relive my childhood.",1422057600,,469,4.222222222222222

3611022,4,B001GFAMP6,Happy with my purchase and that I have all the saved by the bell original seasons..had to purchase the two movies separate though..a few glitches some of the episodes freeze and won't let me finish watching them..and I don't like how the episodes are all out of order when you watch them..not the sellers fault but something I did not like..not sure if mine is the only glitched discs or others have the problem..but all in all happy I got them for this price..brought back childhood memories for sure ;),1387670400,,504,4.611111111111111

3611025,4,B001GFAMP6,"It arrived on time and carefully packaged and was at the best price, but it was not the complete series, it was missing the las vegas episode, the hawian style episode and the college years episodes. therefore I cannot rate this transaction as being 5 stars, By the title saying ""Complete Series"" I was expecting every episode to be included. But I would still order from this sell again, they did a great job with the packaging and shipping. The price was even unexpectedly cheap.",1374278400,2,481,4.670588235294118

3611029,4,B001GFAMP6,"Great show.  This is in the standard 480p.  The episodes seem to be in random order in a few places.  I've been told that it's not the DVD's package fault per say, because the show did randomly air at different times back in the day out of order almost, and thus the DVDs just air it in the same order that it originally showed on TV.  This show was great; I just wish that they stuck more to the story more because random characters and relationships got dropped with no explanation when the next episode came on.  You will also need to get the Hawaiian & Las Vegas specials, plus the college years.  Watch the Hawaiian episode after season three, then the college years after season 5, then the Las Vegas one at the very end.",1372118400,5,727,4.3088235294117645
3611030,5,B001GFAMP6,My favorite TV Show growing up - I used to watch this show everyday coming home from school- love having it now on DVD - TY! :),1369353600,2,127,3.740740740740741
3611031,1,B001GFAMP6,"This is not the complete series or even the complete individual seasons. The 3rd, 4th, & 5th seasons are mixed up, left out, & out of order. Season 4 only shows 8 episodes. Season 5 gets the episodes out of order and doesnt show the graduation (series finale). I see why its only $30. I would return it but i watched it and its a collector's item, well maybe not this set. Lionsgate failed big time. Dont buy it, no recommendation here.",1369353600,3,436,4.329268292682927

3611033,5,B001GFAMP6,"This is basically three different sets combined into one set. You receive discs for season 1-2, 3-4, and 5. I had expected this was more a boxed set so was surprised by how they came but love them either way. Wonderful series that can be watched over and over again by the entire family.",1366761600,,287,4.333333333333333

3611037,5,B001GFAMP6,"This is a great TV show to have on DVD,I Love Saved By The Bell alot and it's a fun show to watch. I recommend this show for anyone who likes it on MTV2 and it's got all 5 Seasons so if anyone wants the whole set,I recommend the complete series because it has all the DVDs together. This is Saved By The Bell Seasons 1,2,3,4 and 5 that's the whole high school set. There's also the college years and the two movies but the high schools are great too. So if anyone likes Saved By The Bell I would recommend this,the complete series but you can also get the DVDs separately. I really love Saved By The Bell and this is a great show to watch on DVD so I'd recommend anyone to purchase the DVDs and it's a fun show,the characters are fun and awesome.
There's Zack,A.C.,Screech,Lisa,Jessie,Kelly,Tori-the new girl in season 5 and Mr. Belding in all 5 seasons of the DVDs. This is a Fun and Awesome show for all ages,anyone can watch this and it's so awesome to have on DVD to watch anytime. This is a very good show and it's a great show for children also even adults to watch.",1359244800,,1072,4.20873786407767

3611042,3,B001GFAMP6,In my Save by the Bell series I had two of the disks scratched when I got it. I was please with how fast my shipment came but not satified with the quality of the disks.,1351814400,,169,3.7222222222222223
3611043,5,B001GFAMP6,"Ignore the guy who said everything's out of order and it's not correct. The very first season with Miss Bliss isn't included because technically that wasn't saved by the bell when it was first created. And when the show was originally aired they did go back and forth between Malibu Sands and Bayside. As far as season 5 is concerned, Kelly and Jessie didn't sign on to do extra episodes( those which include Tori instead) so that's why they're mixed together through out the 5th season. Believe it or not, that's how the episodes were really ordered. You just may not have remembered it because you were 10.",1343606400,49,608,4.638888888888889
3611044,5,B001GFAMP6,My brother inroduced me to this show which is very good as well as all the charactors. The biggest and only mistake they made was when they broke Zach And Kelly up. They were good as a couple. At least they fixed that in the spin-off. You should get this show.,1338163200,,260,4.117647058823529
3611045,3,B001GFAMP6,"I searched around to check what's included in this package and read somewhere that it included the hawaii and vegas movie episodes.  Unfortunately that is not the case.  Given amazon's current pricing, it's cheaper to purchase the dvd's individually, since that's how the dvd's come anyways.  Overall I'm happy this is available on dvd, I just wish the product description describes what's included.",1337299200,10,399,5.301587301587301
3611046,1,B001GFAMP6,"I was really looking forward to watching the entire Saved by the bell series.  Loved this show growing up and I am a stickler for watching shows in order as they were aired.  Well if thats what your looking for then this is NOT the series for you.  I own hundreds of TV Show series on DVD and this is the only one i have a negative thought about.  The ""first"" season is not the true first season of the show and the 5 season as you watch them don't even flow in order.  Youll watch one episode and its the summer when everyone is working at the resort, the next there back in school.  The next there abck in summer.  Another so called ""season"" has one episode with Tori and then next she isn't there but Kelli and Jessie are back?  The seasons are very disorganized and again; I cant state this strong enough; this is NOT the COMPLETE series.  It might be the compelte series released on DVD BUT not the compelte series as the show was originally released.

Side note, if you are not a stickler like i am and longing to watch a show in order then I would give this 5 stars.  It does contain many of the ""good humor"", ""wholesome"", good episodes the show was known for.  My only problem is like i stated above.  Hope this helps!

8305270,3,B001GFAMP6,"It is fine but of course it's not in HD so it's the same quality as when it's on tv.
Also I just started season 1, disc THREE. And the first episode on this disc is the pilot episode I'm pretty sure because they don't know Slater and all meet for the first time. I've already watched two complete discs. So that's super frustrating. It's like they just put all of season 1 on a bunch of discs but didn't put them in any order. Really really annoying. And this will be more annoying in the future seasons when their relationships start and those storylines will be out of order. SIGH.

Glad I bought them cuz I love this show but annoyed the episodes are not in order",1483574400,,666,4.203125
