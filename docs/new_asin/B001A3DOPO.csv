I came under the spell of de Montalembert's voice and his language, which is empty of agenda about his loss and rather beyond acceptance too. I learned about vision and compassion and something more- the ""more"" part isn't missing; a very deep bow <gassho>",1499990400,,293,5.125
8275860,5,B001A3DOPO,What an extraordinary film! I love this iconic poetic film so much that I wanted to have my own copy so that I can watch it many times.,1448064000,,135,3.857142857142857
8275861,3,B001A3DOPO,"The premise of the film is very strong, and the nonchalant way the protagonist relates what for most of us would be a disaster (i.e. to be struck blind in an attack) is very powerful and touching. However, the fact that the images - for me - lack another layer of meaning is not a plus. I had hoped for something as allusive as 'Sans Soleil' but in the end I found most of the image work lackluster and formless. I stayed riveted to the voice over and the revelations of his strange life 'post blindness' but I could as easily have listened to an audiobook.
Good, but not great.",1316217600,,578,4.263636363636364
8275862,5,B001A3DOPO,"This is one of those extremely rare, life changing true stories.  When you watch it, you will truly learn what grace, dignity, determination, gratitude, and courage mean and you will also realize how much of life's wonders and how many of its priceless gifts we manage to foolishly take for granted each and every day.",1266710400,,318,4.781818181818182
8275863,5,B001A3DOPO,"Quite simply one of the most remarkable films ever made.

The true story of an artist who was suddenly blinded without prior warning.

He describes the process of going blind, the changes in his life since he became blind, and his changed outlook on life.

Makes one thankful for every minute of life.

The film is a narrative with atmospheric and emotional music plus scenes relevant to the artist's life story.

It should be shown in all schools to pupils in their early teens.

As important a film as one might ever see.",1226880000,,523,4.56989247311828
