1817730,5,B00007JZU4,"Well, I first saw this movie on TV when I was a little girl... it made such an impact on me that I checked the TV Guide for years to come waiting for it to be shown again. Finally, about 5 years later, it was and I managed to get it taped on VHS. This week, 10 years after I first saw it, I now have the DVD.
I love this absorbing film with the old-fashioned story-telling and the way the movie un-folds. We watch the characters develop as they grow within themselves (the acting is absolutely superb by everyone). There is a lot to learn from this story - which is a heart-warming gentle story about love, passion, friendship and family. There are a lot of sad moments yet this film also makes you laugh out loud at times too. This film is quite powerful in a naive sort of way. The ending is satisfying and you feel like you have also grown-up with the characters - in this romantic adventure of human spirit. A family film mainly directed towards girls - it'll make you want to go and hug your loved ones when you've finished watching it! I even love the music to this film and wish they would release the entire motion picture soundtrack on CD. Fantastic! Go watch it (especially if you're young at heart).....this is a truely lovely story that deserves more credit than a TV film.",1069718400,39,1285,4.31404958677686
1817731,5,B00007JZU4,"I recently found this movie once again in my video store. I had seen it at a young age when it first came out, and I recall it making as much of an impact on me then as it does now. The beauty of the love story and Alice's personal triumphs are so  poignant, not to mention her interactions with Ellie and her father. The symbolism of the roses in relation to Alice was beautifully thought out. I laughed and cried throughout the whole movie. I was fortunate enough to obtain a copy of the book that this movie was based on from Amazon, and it was fantastic! If you loved the movie, get your hands on the book! Both are definite keepers!",1056412800,6,637,4.178861788617886
1817732,4,B00007JZU4,I just recently watched this movie and I totaly loved it. I'm a big fan of reese witherspoon so I knew that I'd enjoy it but I loved her brother sammy and how he fell in love with this abused girl. It showed that Handicapped people are just as smart as anybody else. Everybody should see this film and learn the  meaning of True Love and Friendship.,1049241600,8,349,4.208955223880597
1817733,5,B00007JZU4,"There were a couple of aspects of this movie that were a little too neat and packaged, like how Reese'es character's dad changes overnight and such.  But I have to say that this movie was riveting to me.  I have never before seen Patricia Arquette and I was just astounded.  Her performance is absolutely superb.  To me, a book or movie is great, when I literally feel like I have become a person in the story, and feel everything that person feels.  That is why this movie is so great.  Patricia's character is that person in this movie, at least to me.  I am an absolute fan of Reese Witherspoon, so I couldn't be too objective as I love everything about her and she is great in this movie as always.  Her character really shows the love of a true friend to the abused girl.  I cannot imagine anyone watching this movie and not enjoying it.  It is a truly heartwarming story.  I will watch it again and again.  If you like it, check out ""The Man in the Moon.""",1045785600,18,961,4.277777777777778
1817734,5,B00007JZU4,"I can't believe I hadn't heard of this movie until it's recent availability at our video store. It was made in 1991, so it's not new, Reese Witherspoon and Patricia Arquette are very young in it. It is truly a beautiful story, and I was astounded at Miss Arquette's acting ability. I highly recommend this film, it was warm, touching, funny, and wonderfully acted by the entire cast.",1043280000,9,383,4.647058823529412

1817816,5,B00007JZU4,"This is the first time I've seen this movie and it's absolutely endearing. It's like getting a glimpse into the early 1900's and the way people lived in that era. The movie features a fine cast from Beau Bridges to Reese Witherspoon, all fantastic actors in the depiction of small community, family helping those less fortunate, romance between a young boy seeking college and his natural attraction to a deaf girl. A brother and sister help the illiterate deaf girl, played by Arquette, to learn to live among everyday people who accept her with a little help from a loving and generous family. The film teaches a lot of things but most importantly, how a family grows and develops a more loving, close-knit fabric of genuine family that had been lost when the daughter and son's mother died and the father had given up on life. The deaf Allie is wild, at first, until the brother/sister teach her to read and write. I watched her grow and grew a little bit more, myself. The brother gradually falls in love with a ""new and improved"" deaf Allie who will charm at times and break your heart at others. I'm very glad I found this movie on Amazon. I could not look away until it was all over. I wished to see more. I would give it more stars if available. If you do not enjoy this movie, then watch it again and it will become more clear, if you like to know some of the ""older ways.""",1454889600,4,1382,4.40234375

1817842,5,B00007JZU4,"I discovered this little gem of a film years ago on Lifetime. I seem to need to watch it periodically! The performances are so wonderful, particularly Patricia Arquette, whose work is just incredible. It is unsentimental when it could have been Hallmark-y in its story. These characterizations are real; Diane Keaton's direction is excellent.",1444176000,2,342,5.351851851851852

1817846,5,B00007JZU4,Reese Witherspoon is an amazing actress. She played this difficult role with great compassion and in a  manner that really increased the emotion felt for this terribly mistreated young lady. The story was compelling and the characters well developed..  It was difficult to believe that anyone could treat a person so terribly but unfortunately there are cases in which such a degree of meanness have occurred. It was an excellent example of how people can make a difference in someone's life if they are willing to make the effort to help.,1440374400,4,539,4.912087912087912
1817847,2,B00007JZU4,"Sort of lame story line, but neat to see Reese Witherspoon acting so young and doing a good job of it, even in an odd sort of movie.  Too many leaps in reality on this.  But found the actors interesting to watch all the same.",1439856000,,225,3.977777777777778

1817872,1,B00007JZU4,"I had to stop watching because the acting was so flat and phony I just couldn't stand it.  The only redeeming feature was Reese Witherspoon who, even at her tender age, was head and shoulders above the others in sincerity.  I do not know if she did her own stunts, but whoever did the fence hopping and horse riding of the Witherspoon part was excellent.  Reese Witherspoon was every bit as cute as I expected she would be, but even that was not enough to make me sit through the whole thing.  I may try it again, but it will be a chore.",1434153600,,537,4.184466019417476
1817873,5,B00007JZU4,"This movie is excellent and heartwarming.  I can't imagine being deaf back in the days and how people treated deaf people.  My husband is 85% deaf because of the work he does, and it is very hard on hearing people to deal with them not fully hearing and understanding what we are saying.

This is a story for many ages and is a great family film!",1426636800,,341,4.08955223880597

1817896,5,B00007JZU4,"Patricia Arquette won the Best Supporting Oscar this year for Boyhood & is currently starring the CBS series ""Cyber CSI.""  That triggered me to want to see some of her earlier work, which led to ""Wildflower.""  Arquette is nothing short of amazing in this early role of hers.  As Alice Guthrie, she convincingly portrays a deaf child compounded by social deprivations of backwoods misunderstanding.  Her epileptic grand mal seizure was frightening.  The arc in her character is breathtaking.  Reese Witherspoon also is excellent as Ellie Perkins, a young girl whose mother is deceased, raised by her illiterate father played by Beau Bridges.  William McNamera plays Ellie's brother Sammy who develops a crush on Alice and longs to go to college.  The dynamic between the three teen leads is excellent, directed with a steady hand by Diane Keaton.  Norman Max Maxwell who has not done a lot of work this century plays Ormand Guthrie, the often drunk and violent step-father of Alice.  He is indeed scary in the role.  The film is a made-for-television film and has a PG13 feel to it.  It has many excellent themes like the value of friendship, choosing your friends on their personal qualities rather than social status and family loyalty.  Well worth seeking this gem out.  Enjoy!",1426118400,3,1279,4.971698113207547

The actors do an excellent job drawing you into the story. Patricia Arquette portrays Alice, a partially deaf girl who also has seizures. Arquette's performance is brilliant.
This movie will take you on a mild emotional rollercoaster ride. You can laugh and cry, get angry, and feel happy as the movie progresses.
I highly recommend this movie. It is rated PG-13 which is appropriate. There is some violence as Alice and her mother are physically, verbally, and emotionally abused by Alice's stepfather. No f-bombs or lewd language, but there are a couple of scenes of a sexual nature.

1818015,5,B00007JZU4,"I first saw Wildflower, on the Lifetime channel, in the early 90's. I instantly fell in love with it, and have watched it many times. To watch it with someone who has never seen it, thrills me. It is my gift to them, and they are hooked as well. Very few movies accomplish this. My first copy of it, was recorded off TV. Imagine my glee when I found it on VHS. I loaned that copy out, and never got it back. I now have my treasured movie on DVD, and it won't leave my sight again.

I knew when I saw it, that the young Reese Witherspoon, and Patricia Arquette would be big stars some day. Every actor in the movie, is superb.

'Wildflower' struck a cord in me, because I, like Alice, have Epilepsy. She is said to be ""devil teched"" by her evil stepfather. Both she, and her mother, are brutally treated by him. This, another painful cord, as I was the victim of abuse by an ex-boyfriend.

Seeing Alice thrive throughout the movie gives you hope, and you'll cheer for her. I don't see this movie, listed on any of the actors credits; probably because it, sadly, wasn't shown in a theater. Dianne Keaton did a perfect job, in her directing. Wildflower is my second favorite movie after 'The Color Purple'.

Ellie and her older brother, Sammy, discover Alice locked in a shed one day,  and are horrified to realize she lives in the shed.

They befriend Alice and slowly teach her how to be, as Alice says, ""a real girl"".

The story is wonderful and heartwarming.

If you have read the novel by Sara Flanigan, however, I don't recommend the film. Although Diane Keaton did a wonderful job, the cast is fabulous, and Sara Flanigan did the telepay, it simply doesn't live up to the book.

Understandably, there are many cases where the movie just isn't as good as the film, but there is far too much left out or changed to make this beautiful novel a beautiful film. I never saw it on television and waited years for it to be released so I could finally see it. I loved the book SO much.

The story, itself, was a good story.  Pretty typical and no surprises.  I think the ending could have been developed a little more.  I believe this was a TV movie so I wasn't expecting too much.  However, I was pleasantly surprised.  I was kind of hoping they killed the horrible stepfather,  It would have been a better storyline that would have provided a background to a more developed ending,  However, this was originally a novel and I assume they stayed true to the original story,  I would recommend this movie,  It does tend to lend itself to the ""chick flick"" category :-)",1503446400,2,856,4.7482993197278915

7977456,5,B00007JZU4,I came upon this movie by chance and now i think it was more than chance. It was the best movie i ever saw. The entire cast was superb. The characters' depth and portrayal were moving and the movie never fell into shallowness. I felt I was touched by something very human. Very real. I am grateful to have come upon and seen this movie.,1491609600,,336,4.184615384615385
