6414492,2,B00KCA32P8,"There are 2 shows that are just really, really bad on this dvd.  I bought this because I really like him as an actor, but these scripts would make anybody look bad.  No wonder this was only on for 2 seasons.",1409616000,,207,4.024390243902439
6414493,3,B00KCA32P8,Some episodes are good and some are kind of lame. Especially the last one. I have both of these series because I really like Kevin Whatley. He is wonderful in Inspector Morse and Lewis. These are just not his best.,1408320000,,214,4.375
6414494,5,B00KCA32P8,"Kevin Whately is best known to many as the eager detective Lewis who assisted the iconic Inspector Morse (the late John Thaw) and more recently, as Inspector Lewis, who mentors DI Hathaway. But here is the young Whately playing a more flawed character, whose professional skills are right on track but his personal life is more soap opera than crackerjack mystery. This series may not  be familiar to US viewers, but it's a wonderful treat to follow each storyline and see Jimmy Griffin, the ex-cop turned insurance investigator, at work. Highly watchable and if you see one episode, well, you naturally want more, more, more!",1408320000,,626,4.961904761904762
6414495,5,B00KCA32P8,"THE BROKERS MAN, 1988. Hes spent years on television solving murders in the you-would-have- thought-peaceful city of the dreaming spires, Oxford, home  to its world-famous, highly-prestigious university, in INSPECTOR MORSE  and INSPECTOR LEWIS. But in-between, for two seasons, 1997-98,  likeable fan favorite Kevin Whately, Inspector Lewis in the two television series above, was the titular character Jimmy Griffin in THE BROKERS MAN. The former detectivewhat else -- turned insurance fraud investigator takes whatever work he can find, using his detection skills, cunning, charm and instincts.  While trying to save his marriage, his family and his dignity. In Series 2 of this original British mystery/drama/crime Bentley-BBC production, Griffin investigates a fire, searches for missing children, deals with his rebellious teenage daughter, and is suspected of burglarizing his own home. With Peter Firth (MI-5); Annette Ekblom (HOLBY CITY); Jill Baker (SALMON FISHING IN THE YEMEN); Holly Davidson, (THE BILL) and John McEnery (SILENT WITNESS). The box set consists of six mysteries, on two disks, running approximately 5 hours, 305 minutes to be exact, letter boxed.  With subtitles, thank you RLJ Entertainment/Acorn, for though the characters speak clearly and sound is fine, they still help. I received this as a review copy.

The episodes are:
Disc 1
Episode 1: ""Pensioned Off""
After an attractive female police officer with a Scottish accent falls down the stairs at her station, she files a claim for sexual harassment.  Griffin is given the case. He considers it straightforward, but realizes hell have to cut through the rampant sexism of the cop shop if he has any chance of discovering what really happened.

Episode 2: ""Horses for Courses""
Jodie goes to a rave with her boyfriend without her parents' knowledge or permission; is caught when the club goes up in flames.  Griffin has his suspicions.

Episode 3: Playback
A brother and sister vanish in a kayaking accident. Their bodies are never found. Six months later, their parents are engaged in a public battle over the paltry sum they've been offered in compensation.

Disc 2

Episode 4: Kith and Kin
A wealthy, racist ranting military antiquities collector is robbed of several valuable rare medals, left with a ransom note for their return. He dreads losing his treasured possessions forever, so circumvents the police and asks his insurance agent to orchestrate a trade for them.

Episode 5: Keyman
The board member of a construction conglomerate is shot dead in a brothel; Griffins insurance client Godzilla hires Jimmy to investigate.  Theres been a keyman insurance policy taken out on the man that stands to reward the victims company 10 million.

Episode 6: Swansong
Jimmy's home is virtually emptied by neighborhood thieves; he finds himself on the other side of the insurance game. Meanwhile, he's given the case of an aging nightclub singer whose husband died in a mysterious car crash.

The cases in this final series are somewhat more complex than in the first, and several of them came across with considerable power.  Plus the series is eminently enjoyable, thanks to Whatelys rumpled charm and smarts, and a nice cast that works nicely together, keeping things on the light side.  The scenery is watchable, production values are good.  No violence, nor blood and gore.  The original mystery stories are sharply written, give us new kinds of crime, provide a fresh twist on their genre, and were critically praised at their British debut.  You  might find it time to get acquainted with Jimmy Griffin.",1407801600,7,3588,5.236013986013986
6414496,5,B00KCA32P8,"Kevin Whately, best known as Detective Sergeant Lewis opposite the late John Thaw on Inspector Morse, then later in his own spin-off series as Detective Inspector Lewis, took time between to star in this short-lived but entertaining series THE BROKER'S MAN, playing an ex-cop turned insurance investigator.

As Jimmy Griffin, Whately plays a likable fellow who needs to grow up, especially when it comes to his personal relationships. The nice thing about this series is that he does, in fact, grow up, re-establishing his relationship with his wife and children. In his professional life, Jimmy is a little less successful than he becomes with his family, but nonetheless manages to keep his head above water. This is, in part, due to the dedication of his long-suffering associates, Vinnie and Harriet (Potter, no less). The interaction between Jimmy and his two ""families"", coupled with some genuinely good stories, makes THE BROKER'S MAN good, though not particularly outstanding, entertainment.

Series Two, which ends with Jimmy on much more solid ground, maritally, is better than series one, in large part to the re-casting of aforesaid Harriet. Charlotte Bellamy, as Harriet (replacing Sarah-Jane Potts in the first series) is a dynamic actress who adds more colour and humour to the role of Jimmy's associate, managing to break free of the ""put the kettle on and make the tea"" role she was often relegated to in the first series.

Like so many shows that revolve around a central character, THE BROKER'S MAN stands or falls on the charisma and capability of its star and Kevin Whately delivers. His weary sort of Everyman appeal is harder to understand for North American audiences who expect good looks and perfect teeth, but in Great Britain he is especially loved.

While THE BROKER'S MAN lasted for only two series, it was the just the right amount. Taken for what it is, a change from the police procedural perspective, it still manages to present good mysteries with a breath of fresh air.",1407369600,12,2005,5.030120481927711
6414497,5,B00KCA32P8,"Londons Griffin Investigations looks for fraud while the boss struggles in family relations. You get sophisticated suspense, mystery and humor from the insurance point of view. Its a unique crime drama approach. It works as believable. I loved the uniqueness of Series One, and this series was even better. Fast paced, multi-plot episodes, career/family issue crossovers, make it as worthy as any of the top cop shows of the late ninetys.

Cast is led by Jimmy (Kevin Whately Inspector LEWIS; Insp Morse) back with his Ex Sally (Annette Ekblom Holby City) with daughter Jodie (Holly Davidson) continuing but with an increased plot significance. Jimmys office staff is Harriet, replacement played well by Charlotte Bellamy; and Vinny (Al Ashton) also co-writer of episode 5. John McEnery (Silent Witness) now plays Godzilla Turnbull. Add good guest-stars.

Love British series after 2000, but this is not it. Apparently is very hard to state the real date of series (I've found a lot from the 90' when says ""2012"" and so on).
