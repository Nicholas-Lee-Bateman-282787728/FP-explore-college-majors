The picture shown is not the picture on the DVD (the customer image is correct), and Marc Anthony is not represented on this DVD. But the one star was harsh. Selena, Jennifer Lopez, Enrique Iglesias, Ricky Martin are just some of the artist on this dvd. There are 14 videos that include Pop, Rap, Hip-Hop, R&B and Romantic Ballad.  All the videos are in English.

The music videos on this DVD are:

1. Dreaming of You - Selena
2. Livin La Vida Loca- Ricky Martin
3. She's All I Had- Ricky Martin
4. If You Had My Love- Jennifer Lopez
5. Bailamos- Enrique Iglesias (not the Wild West version)
6. 100% Pure Love- Crystal Waters
7. Twinz- Big Pun (feat. Snoop Dogg)
8. You Came Up- Big Pun
9. Virgin - Chico Debarge
10. Soopaman Lover Chico Debarge
11. Don Cartagena - Fat Joe
12. When you Tell Me That You Love Me - Julio Inglesias(Sr)with Dolly Parton
13. Buzzin' - Latino Velvet
14. I Wish- Barrio Boys",1257984000,3,967,4.379888268156424
8117866,1,B000F65US6,"I just received this piece of junk, cheap copy of a DVD and am very disappointed. Don't be misled by the cover. The artists shown on the cover do not represent the majority of the ridiculous videos on this DVD. I'm a big Marc Anthony fan, and since his face is on the cover, I was looking forward to seeing his video. NOT THERE! The majority of the videos are of obscure (at least to me!) artists that I've never heard of and have no interest in. Also, I live in Brazil, where there is a large DVD pirating industry. If I wanted a cheap copy of a DVD, I'd go to the corner of my block and buy one, I certainly wouldn't order it from Amazon. Amazon should be ashamed to sell such garbage!",1183680000,2,687,4.0962962962962965
