1723964,5,B000068DBD,An absolute classic. Add one more to my Tarantino collection.,1518739200,,61,5.2

1723966,4,B000068DBD,"RELEASED IN 1997 and directed by Quentin Tarantino, Jackie Brown is a crime drama about a middle-aged flight attendant, the eponymous Brown (Pam Grier), who smuggles huge sums of cash from Mexico to L.A. for a too-cool arms dealer, Ordell (Samuel L. Jackson). When shes caught by two agents (Michael Keaton & Michael Bowen) they propose a deal to apprehend the dealer in exchange for her freedom. In the meantime Ordell enlists an aging bondsman, Max Cherry (Robert Forster), to release her with the aim of eradicating her. Brown knows Ordells wicked intentions and devises a plan to not only survive the life-or-death situation, but come out the richer for it. Bridget Fonda plays Ordells hot white babe and Robert De Niro his fresh-out-of-prison pal.

This is Tarantinos most realistic film, so don't expect his typical cartoonish-ness and buckets of blood. There are occasional flashes of violence, but this is mostly a talk-driven drama. Interesting dialogues have always been one of Tarantinos strengths and so it is here. Grier is a distinguished protagonist while Fonda is smoking in her Daisy Dukes. De Niros character is in a post-prison stupor, but you know hes still very formidable, which one character is too dull to realize. Bottom Line: Jackie Brown may not be as eventful as Pulp Fiction (1994) or Django Unchained (2012), but its a very good crime drama and unique in Tarantinos oeuvre.

THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours & 34 minutes and was shot in the greater Los Angeles area (e.g. Venice Beach, Carson, Torrance, Compton, Carson & Hawthorne). WRITERS: Tarantino wrote the script based on Elmore Leonards 1992 novel Rum Punch (the only film he wrote based on a previous work).

1723969,5,B000068DBD,"It was certainly difficult back in the 90s for moviegoers who went bananas over Tarantinos former hits: Resevoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, to appreciate the more mature Jackie Brown. But what movie could??
Adapted from an Elmore Leonard novel, Tarantino wrote a much better screenplay!!

Pam Grier, who WAS Jackie Brown, was certainly her best role ever!! And the love and admiration that Tarantino had for Grier was very apparent!! She was beautiful in this film!!
The other standout was Robert Forrester, as Max Cherry! He was a revelation! And very deserving of his Oscar nomination!
Samuel L. Jackson was a charicature of a thug!! But he was convincing as a stone-cold killer.
Robert DeNiro played the institutionalized Louis with aplomb!
Bridget Fonda was fun, as Jacksons surfer girl.
I won't go further, but I LOVED this movie, even when it first came out, because Im a huge fan of Pam Grier.",1514678400,,896,4.894736842105263

In any case. Pam is surrounded by a cast of A list actors and an exciting storyline with a solid director. Jackie Brown is fun , brutal, and will keep you glued to the screen.",1506816000,,360,4.202898550724638

1723989,2,B000068DBD,"Black 44 year old woman finds herself in trouble with the law again at this point in her life. She works as a stewardess for a small US-to-Mexico airline. A drug dealer in LA uses her as his mule to bring back his money for guns. The feds catch on. She works with them to get out of the mess. During all of this a small time bail bondsman gets sucked up in this life of drugs, guns, murders, etc and plots with the woman to get her the money and the drug, gun dealing murder caught.

The movie is really a black cultural movie about the typical world of dealing drugs, violence, profanity (... are used every other word by all characters), intimidation, sex, etc There is this concerted effort in the script to make sure we all know and think ""Jackie Brown"" is ""beautiful"", and it is done in such a way that we are supposed to be OK with her schemes . . . like because she is sorta attractive that 1) it is OK what she has done and should not be punished for it and 2) that is is OK what is going to do (basically more of the same) to get out of it. I also felt like Tarrantino wrote this and threw in a few white people to make it 1) unrealistic and 2) mainstream enough to cash in at the box office. Those parts just didn't make sense. I think he thought if the got Fonda and DeNiro his shenanigans wouldn't be so obviously . . . They still are. The only thing I can saw for this movie (and it isn't much) is that as rough as these people are the gore and violence was done in a way that you really didn't see it in graphic detail.",1501545600,,1533,3.993485342019544

1724022,5,B000068DBD,"I was one pf the few people that HATED ""Pulp Fiction"". I did not like the non-linear storylines. I did not like the liberal use of the N-word. I thought it was too violent and at times, just plain weird. However, this film made me a Quinten Tarantino fan. The casting was OUTSTANDING, with stand-outs like Pam Grier (who reminded us why she was the Queen of the blaxploitation genre), Sam Jackson (delivering another brilliant performance, and subtle but monumental performances by Robert Forrester and Robert DeNiro. There is very little I do not like about this film, including the superb soundtrack.",1496448000,,602,4.911764705882353
1724023,5,B000068DBD,"I never read the book, so I can't compare the two, however, the movie was great! It's an Elmore Leonard plot, so no need to say more. The actors - you probably know them all - and they all nailed their part.

And the Soundtrack...PERFECT!. Across 110th St. = Bobby Womak

I was amused and entertained. I can't say much more than. If you like Leonard's writing and you like the actors, you simply can't go wrong.

(if you don't like the ""N"" word, even when used by black people, the don't bother watching 'cause you'll just get all upset about it.)",1495929600,,547,4.3431372549019605

1724039,5,B000068DBD,"Jackie Brown (1997) is the film after the enormously successful Pulp Fiction in the Terantino filmography. This film pays homage to the blaxploitation films of the 1970's, and does it with flair and stellar performances by its cast, namely Pam Grier. She manages to pull the viewer in with her incredible screen presence.  Her role as Jackie Brown was a comeback of sorts, and she is up to the task here. Samuel L. Jackson again delivers a great performance in his second consecutive appearance in a Terantino film. This film starts very slow, but builds momentum. I will admit that I had to be away from it for a week because it really didn't resonate at first. What's great about this Tarantino film is that it winds up being a love story in the end. I also love the fact that it's linear and straightforward, which sort of contrasts his other films. Give this film your undivided attention, and you'll be rewarded. The screenplay is very well-written, and the music is fabulous, which keeps this film from being ordinary. The blu ray is packed with special features (3 hours worth) to make this viewing experience a memorable one. The picture and sound quality are great, and overall this blu ray is essential to fans of Quentin Terantino.",1492560000,,1242,4.723502304147465

I didn't like seeing Pam Grier play this kind of role. I liked her as a everyday superhero, like one of my favorite Grier roles ""Coffy.""

Jackie Brown has a little bit of double-cross and crookedness to her, don't she.

1724091,5,B000068DBD,"Imo, Quentin's best film. The characters are developed enough, considering this is a film. Quentin takes us to, or references, many of LA's more local spots.

The story is impeccable to boot. Just a hoot. And the characters and actors that portray them are very good and believable. We coulda used more Winston, but whatever.

The lines are amazing. Quentin and the top of his dialogue game.

This is his #1 or #2 film and definitely his most under appreciated.  I don't think I could ever put a film of his above Pulp Fiction, but this one is more 'real life'.",1482969600,,561,4.524752475247524

Tarantino proves that he doesn`t always have to have shocking violence to grab an audience`s attention. Jackie Brown has a wonderful cast of colorful
characters. My favorite is the excellent Robert Forster who was nominated for his performance. The movie has a great 70s look and feel to it with terrific music

It's a comedy, a drama, a crime film, it has one of my favourite characters in movie history (Ordell Robbie, played to perfection by Samuel L. Jackson) The real treat of the film is that it's a slice of life look at people dealing with age and facing retirement. Ordell knows he can spend the rest of his life spending, Lewis can't smoke a bong properly anymore, Jackie Brown and Max Cherry are both stuck in jobs that will have them with things that ain't worth a damn Quentin Tarantino said he made this film for black audiences and everyone else is invited. And while I've enjoyed everything he's made, this one I can't fault and the parts I love, I love more than in his other films and a lot of other films I love in general This film is a rarity - how many films do you see with an African-American women of Pam Griers age have a roll like this in the film She looks absolutely stunning and is quite simply excellent in the film, as everyone is.",1454371200,,1141,4.23394495412844
1724277,5,B000068DBD,"My son gave me the DVD of ""Jackie Brown"" about three years ago, and I never got round to watching it because I was unimpressed by all the Tarantino hype.  Then, all the fuss about the lack of nominations of people of color for the 2016 Oscars broke in the news media, and I decided, as an act of solidarity (!) to see the movie.  Long story short, I was absolutely won over.  The plot being of the kind it is -- a caper or ""sting"" plot -- I really can't go into detail, but you soon begin to enjoy the way in which everyone assumes that everyone else is out for his or her advantage, and the audience certainly WANTS things to work out in a certain way, but we're kept off balance throughout.  The pacing of the story is just perfect, and Tarantino adds a little wrinkle that we don't get in a movie like ""The Sting"" -- he will show a scene and repeat it so that we see it again through other eyes.  He doesn't overuse the device, and its main effect (and purpose) is to let the reader see exactly what's going on among characters who don't trust one another. The plot is based on a novel by Elmore Leonard, and while I haven't read that particular book, which Tarantino took a lot of liberties with, the spirit of the movie is very Leonardian -- stylish, witty, blackly humorous, with the humor coming to the fore more than the darkness.  Leonard reportedly loved it.

What really struck me, though, was the quality of the writing, again by Tarantino.  Each of the three main characters is given a distinct kind of language, and they exhibit their respective idiolects with consistency and naturalness throughout.  The showiest part verbally is that of the gun-running entrepreneur Ordell (Samuel L. Jackson), who gives a terrific performance here, and the sense of his energy and dangerousness is largely created by the fluency with which he rattles off Tarantino's profane black patter -- the writing is in the Mamet class, and Jackson is simply amazing.  It's like listening to music.  Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) is the airline stewardess that Ordell is using to try to get his half-million dollars out of Mexico, and Robert Forster is Max Cherry, a bail bondsman that Ordell uses to keep his helpers and himself out of jail.  Jackie and  Max are quieter than Ordell, but their language is distinct from one another too.  Neither Forster nor Grier was in the public eye in 1997, when the movie was made, although Grier especially had had her moment in the sun about twenty years earlier -- but their parts are written so that they can play to their ages, and they reward Tarantino's belief in them with absolutely pitch-perfect performances.  The secondary characters played by Bridget Fonda, Robert DeNiro, Michael Keaton,and Chris Tucker are all given their distinctive profiles -- so the strength and depth of the casting is really quite unusual, especially given that two of the leads were assumed to be past their sell-by dates by this time.  The sense of Tarantino's being totally in control at every moment is certainly present, but such is the quality of the cast that the acting and the development of the story never seem to be mechanical.

Movies with plots like this one have their familiar pleasures.  This one has a bit more -- the relationship that develops between the older characters engages our sympathies without ever seeming impossibly sentimental.  There are a lot of people being cool or pretending to be cool in this movie, and a bit of warmth is welcome -- and we learn that warmth and cool aren't necessarily incompatible.  This is still the only Tarantino movie I've seen, and it's a winner all the way.",1454112000,,3632,4.636505460218409
1724278,5,B000068DBD,"In contrast to his blood spattered early work (with the exception of ""Reservoir Dogs"", a masterpiece from anyone's angle), ""Jackie Brown"" is elegant, subtle, seductive, and just a classy film.  That said, it features some of the vilest human beings on the planet without glorifying them at all, as Tarantino sometimes is fond of doing.

Ordeal (Samuel L. Jackson) and Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) are stuck in the middle of some serious legal and, indeed, mortal matters; former partners in crime and now adversaries, they pretend to be friends on the surface but watch the other's every muscle twitch with a nexus of suspicion.
Only one person can come out on top, really, since the world they operate in is so depraved.

What I found more interesting was the disturbing subplot involving Bridget Fonda (Melanie) and Ordello's best friend and muscle, Louis (Robert De Niro).  The subtext of the whole thing is obviously Robert De Niro himself aging and not acting the way he used to, but we see that in some uncomfortable sense he sees himself--or perhaps a possible daughter? Wife?--in the vicious, predatory Melanie, and he rejects her.  Not just her attempt to jack Ordello's gun trade, but *her*.  As well as being burnt out thoroughly in prison, did Luis see some sort of light?  Is he simply done with being a criminal as well as being done with everything else?  Paradoxically: it was a great performance by De Niro.

Robert Forster (Max Cherry, a Bail Bondsmen) sees the good side of Jackie. This side is interspersed with a not so good side; indeed, her Machiavellian sweep of brilliance in a tight situation is almost demonic.  But that adds to her beauty. Which makes her more sinister.

The ending is wonderful.  Just a great, subdued noir movie, without Tarantino having to embarrass himself with an excess of ""cool"" cultural artifice.",1454112000,,1845,4.878205128205129

Be it Film, Art,  Music, or Literature, all have been reviewed by what I consider to be experts in their fields here on these Amazon reviewer pages. I like to read reviews of what I see or read or listen to, after seeing, reading, or, listening. Most of the reviews I read seem to be from educated people.  I won't say all, but many of these reviews are more concerned with the reviewer attempting to display his or her educational chops in the medium. It seems a weird question to ask, but does education, critical theory, (severe scrutiny) of culture take away from the innate joy that a song, book, film, sculpture (add any art-form) is able to impart upon the ""ignorant"" viewer?

1724434,5,B000068DBD,"Another great Quentin Tarantino movie.  Great all-star cast -- I don't know how he does it.  How does an all-star cast happen in the first place?

Spoiler warning --

I give a lot of credit to Robert Forster who plays the character Max Cherry - a California bail bondsman.  To me, he makes this film great.  Of course you've got your big stars such as Samuel L. Jackson, Robert De Niro, and Michael Keaton.  But Robert Forster comes out all cool, collected, mature, and intelligent.  He brings balance to the whole movie.  I even entertained the possibility that he might have been a real California bail bondsman, like the drill instructor for the movie Full Metal Jacket, until I researched to find out that he's a real actor -- nominated for an Academy Award for best supporting actor for this film.

One attraction to this film is that it stirs up a few nostalgia with such subjects as Southern California, Southern California shopping malls, California bail bonds, and The Delfonics' music ""Didn't I (Blow Your Mind This Time).""

Another attraction is how Pam Grier's character, Jackie Brown, outsmarts the Bureau of Alcohol, Tabacco, and Firearms (ATF) agent, a ruthless smart thug, and others to get herself out of trouble by the end of the film.",1432166400,,1253,4.78139534883721

From the very moment Pam Grier is being followed along the pedway to the camera setup when DeNiro shoots Fonda (the camera does not show her blood like all other directors would), he is awesome.

1724508,5,B000068DBD,"Was this Tarantino's best? I was astonished recently to find that there are people out there...serious critics...who believe it was.

I think most critics withheld judgment because so much of the film is derivative or parody. The whole point of bringing in Pam Grier (and Sid Haig and Robert Forster) was as an homage to blaxploitation films c. 1973.  Even the typography of the logo is a reference to some Pam Grier film of the era.

But the playfulness, and improvisational activity of the actors, pushes this way beyond one's expectations, even for a Tarantino film. The opening scenes with Bridget Fonda, Robert de Niro, and Sam Jackson are utterly extraordinary and set the pace for the whole movie. Somehow, when Pam Grier goes into 'County,' you think she really is going into LA County jail, and nothing is held back.

The wealth of local detail, and ornamentation of minor characters, must be called Shakespearean. Beaumont Livingston? Simone Hawkins? The sales clerk in the 'Billingsley' shop at the Del Amo Mall? Do we really need this much information? Generally we don't, but the fact that Tarantino has put all this information in there makes 'Jackie Brown' a new and rewarding experience every time you see it. And I think I've seen it thirty times.",1426809600,,1264,4.892523364485982

There are some great one liners by Samuel L Jackson, and hysterical interaction between Jackson and Chris Tucker. Both Pam Grier and Bridget Fonda are gorgeous. Even the bail bondsman was great. I suspect this movie might be a first of its kind for a few different reasons.

Everyone, down to the surfer gal were good actors.  Tarrentino's plot was vintage with a touch or two of his gratuitous humorous violence but just that, not the crazy bloodbaths he would get into in his later film.  He is always sending up some film form or another which is enjoyable as long as he doesn't wreck the plot while doing it. Jackie Brown is a standout in that respect.

She made her bones in what was labeled ""Blaxploitation"" films. These films were prevalent and prominent during the tumultuous 70's. The genre offered a vague sense of empowerment. It did, however, allowed actors to showcase their talents. Pam Grier's talent was apparent, so much so she is still in demand",1412380800,,419,4.7534246575342465

The characters are more believable in this film, especially the one played by Robert Forster (as a bail-bondsman) and Pam Grier (as an aging airline flight attendant).  Samuel Jackson is great in the role of a vicious gun dealer.  Tarantino is a superb screenwriter.  The gems in this movie spring forth from the smart, witty dialogue.  Michael Keaton is also great as a dirty cop who won't be outsmarted by Jackie Brown.  Finally, DeNiro, is fine in this supporting role, playing a witless ex-convict who pals around with a gun smuggler.  This is a smart screenplay and the movie has its gravitas, especially when it explores the relationship between two aging people (played by Pam and Robert), one who desperately needs money, the other who needs a way out of a perfunctory existence.",1411948800,,855,4.855172413793103

DeNiro is really understated as Jackson's partner-in-crime, but Forester does an excellent job as the smitten Bail Bondsman.  Tarantino's usual character-rich slate of actors makes the familiar ploy very interesting.  Pam Grier plays everyone and that's cool.  Bridget Fonda looks great and spends the whole film in a bikini top.  Lastly, Chris Tucker's ne'er-do-well Beaumont character is short-lived, but hilarious with his high voice, facial expressions and lines.  Music in the film is great and very appropriate.

His character is menacing and humorous at the same time.  Robert De Niro's portrayal of Jackson's not-to-bright sidekick is an unusual for him and first rate.  Pam Grier's performance matches Jackson's and Robert Forster gives an understated and good performance as the bail bondsman who joins with Grier in foiling Jackson's character.

It is probably the least successful of his movies, as people who like his creepy stuff don't find much of that here.  I guess that's why I like it.  It is a really good story, as much a mind game as The Usual Suspects or Snatch.  Great memorable characters and lines.

I thought the storyline and the dialogue were exceptional and focused.  All of the characters were well thought out and purposed for every event.  Robert Forster and Robert Deniro give amazing performances.  Forster as a professional, but exhausted bail bondsman and Deniro and as a burned-out career criminal. This movie was a wonderful way for a new generation know to Pam Grier.  She embodied Jackie Brown to a T.  Giving a face to the reality of a late-forties woman with her back against the wall based on the decisions she's made.  Great job by the incomparable Samuel Jackson.  He's sly, slick and full of wit.  Bridget Fonda and Michael Keaton show up and do not dissappoint.  You'll like the Chris Tucker cameo as well.

Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) is an air hostess who acts as a cash courier between Mexico and the U.S. for gun runner Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson). Another of Robbie's couriers, Beaumont Livingstone (Chris Tucker) has been arrested so Robbie arranges bail for Livingstone from bail bondsman Max Cherry (Robert Forster), picks him up from jail, and shoots him to prevent him from cutting a deal with the police for reduced jail-time. ATF agent Ray Nicolet (Michael Keaton) and LAPD Detective Mark Dargus (Michael Bowen) are hot on Robbie's trail after Livingstone has already traded information for his freedom. They intercept Brown as she returns to the USA with Robbie's money, but as she is also carrying drugs, they arrest her. Fearing that Brown is now going to give information to the police, Robbie goes to bail bondsman Cherry again. So begins an elaborate series of stings and counter-stings, details of which would spoil the enjoyment of the movie. In the process, an associate of Robbie's, Louis Gara (Robert De Niro), and Robbie's girlfriend, Melanie Ralston (Bridget Fonda) are killed.

1724903,5,B000068DBD,"Easily Quentin Tarantino's most mature work, which admittedly isn't saying much for a director who brought us the Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique and a literal blast of adrenaline to the heart. That's not to say his films have ever lacked in substance - rather, I think the true depth of their character is merely overshadowed by those visceral moments of graphic excess and their stylish methods of delivery. Jackie Brown, instead, manages to step out from that bloody shadow and shine on its own volition. Its lingering close-ups and long doses of heady silence give the impression that the plot is moving slowly, when in fact it's going roughly a mile a minute. Tarantino just wants us to savor the performances of his all-star cast and the tangle of plot threads that surrounds them before forcing our heads out the window and punching the gas in the last twenty minutes. Along the way, he subtly, efficiently grazes a gamut of emotions that leaves us deeply invested in the (often untimely) fate of each character.

I won't discuss the plot as there are many recapitulations below. The cast has been ingeniously assembled and everone has their moment to shine. I was not familiar with Pam Grier from her early days but clearly Tarantino remembered and gave her a gift of a role. Robert Forster ia less showy as the bail bondsman Max  but he anchors the cast impressively.

As others have mentioned, the pace is slow at times but that allows the viewer to let the juicy dialogue  soak in and allows the characters to all make significant contributions.

I'm not gonna compare this to Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, or any other Quentin Tarantino movie. Because it's so special. The soundtrack goes so well with every scene, the acting is seemingly flawless and the plot keeps you interested. It's not big on violent action scenes, but I prefer it that way. Just look at this cast: Pam Grier, Samuel Jackson, Robert Dinero, Michael Keaton. Oh, and Chris Tucker plays a small role and he is just as hilarious as he is in ""Friday."" Those who say this movie drags don't appreciate great dialogue. It's a crime movie that takes it's time. And it's smart. Anyway, it's definitely not a movie for the general audience. If you haven't seen it, give it a try. If you're not into it by the first 10 minutes, it's not for you. This movie is so devoted to it's characters.

Product review: I got this movie for around 13 bucks from Movie Mars. Not bad for a blu ray. The case itself, however, came with a few dents.

1724926,1,B000068DBD,"The only thing worse than Quintin Tarrentino's obsession with and superfluous use of the ""N"" word in his movies, is his death and gratuitous violence fetish. With Jackie Brown he has all this, plus two hours of boredom, wrapped in downtown idioms and street hussle. If vividly illustrating violence for shock value makes someone a genius, then Tarrentino wrote the book. Granted, some of his films have a certain charme' with their offbeat story lines and outcomes (Reservoir Dogs, True Romance), for the most part the rest are basically the same script of mindless pugnaciousness with different scenery and characters. The fact is, if someone not named ""Quintin Tarrentino"" had made this exact same film, it would have gone straight to DVD and in a week to syndication. We'd be picking up copies here for 1 cent a pop. That's how bad this firm is. But it has Tarrentino's name on it so it's not really exploitation trash, it's art. I think Terrentino tried to make a quirky film, but he ended up just boring everyone to death because he doesn't understand that a movie is more than violence and using the N word, a movie really needs a story line.

1724947,5,B000068DBD,"I first saw Jackie Brown in the theater in 1997, and have watched it several more times over the years. Recently, I immersed myself in a blacksploitation festival of close to a dozen films from the early 1970s. In this, his third film, Quentin Tarantino pays homage to the genre's roots while giving us something better than the best that era had to offer. Blacksploitation films were not known for their sizable budgets, after all. Jackie Brown offers more cameras, better sound technicians, mo' better everything.

Pam Grier may not be the young hottie she was back in the Seventies, but she is ten times the actress she was then.

1724950,5,B000068DBD,"Let me begin by saying that, in my opinion, ""Jackie Brown"" was one of the top films of 1997. It was a tough year, though, with ""Titanic"" winning 11 awards, and the likes of ""Good Will Hunting"", ""As Good as it Gets"", ""Amistad"", ""Boogie Nights"", and ""L.A. Confidential"" scooping up the rest. Pam Grier should have won Best Actress, hands down. She didn't. She wasn't even nominated (Helen Hunt won in ""As Good as it Gets""). The only nomination ""Jackie Brown"" got was a well-deserved one for Robert Forster as Best Supporting Actor (as bail/bondsman Max Cherry, in a performance that revitalized his career, as I predict Albert Brooks will benefit from his excellent work in ""Drive"" last year). But, I digress...

Quentin Tarantino borrowed his story from Elmore Leonard's ""Rum Punch"", and crafted a screenplay that is well-timed, taut, often surprising, and even sweet at times. The hip, fast-paced dialogue that has become a Tarantino trademark decorates every scene. But, I suspect quite intentionally, Tarantino designed ""Jackie Brown"" as a golden, fleur-de-lis-trimmed letterbox for Pam Grier to turn the title character into one of the most memorable in the last quarter-century. And, that's exactly what she did.

Bridget Fonda is so absolutely perfect as gun-runner Samuel L. Jackson's sassy ""surfer chick"" that you are convinced that this is who Bridget Fonda really is. Robert DeNiro was given a long leash in his portrayal of a dim-witted, recently-paroled bank robber (not exactly a typecast for him)...and he nails it. And the other characters that spice up the plot are all well-formed and well-acted. But it's the improbable relationship between Jackie and Max that grabs you and won't let you go. Like a swirling, cool, evening fog by the waterfront on a steamy, summer evening, it is hard to define and even harder to grasp, but you know you like it. If you're not a Delfonics ([...]) fan by the end of the film...well, I don't see how you couldn't be.

The quality of the Blu-ray is excellent, both visually and aurally. The extras are plentiful (similar to the Special Edition DVD), with a quirky Tarantino making-of rant and a QT-introduced set of deleted scenes stealing the show. Is it worthwhile to upgrade if you already have ""Jackie Brown"" on DVD? With few exceptions, I believe that it is always worthwhile to do so if you care for a film as part of your collection, rather than just having it around to watch from time to time. In this case, the differences in ""Jackie Brown"" between the two formats are significant and obvious.

Give ""Jackie Brown"" a chance and take it for what it is: a love story between two well-grounded adults that takes a while to develop...even amid the boisterous, violent chaos that is a Tarantino film.",1328227200,,2754,4.890792291220556

1724957,4,B000068DBD,"Quentin Tarantino had a lot to prove after ""Pulp Fiction"" and I bet many people were a little disappointed when ""Jackie Brown"" debuted in 1997. Opening Christmas Day with the tagline ""Santa's Got a Brand New Bag"", audiences were treated to QT's most natural film to date. A film about older folks (gasp!) struggling to stay cool in a modern world. Not much of the verve and energy from ""Pulp"" was carried over to this film, but what was is Tarantino's fantastic dialogue mixed with Elmore Leonard's dense plot and characters. Sometimes it is tough to follow who is betraying who and where allegiances actually lie (I admit to still being a tad confused) but I think that's kind of the point. This is a film to be watched, and enjoyed, multiple times. In short, Tarantino proved he was much more than a one trick pony by creating a film that is the opposite of what had come before (and since) yet still is undeniably a Quentin Tarantino film. If you don't warm to his extreme genre-laced work then give this one a try.

As far as this Blu-ray is concerned, the film has never looked or sounded better. With some caveats. The image has been tweaked to give it a more warm palette, specifically regarding skin tones. They can look a little too sun-burned at times. This didn't bother me as much as the lack of fine detail. Oh it certainly looks a lot better than it did on DVD but I expected it to be a bit more sharp. Still a satisfying transfer (approved by Tarantino apparently). I have very little complaints about the audio, however. The 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track is tip-top, showcasing both the fantastic dialogue and songs. Another minor complaint: they've replaced the old Miramax logo with the new CGI one at the start of the film. A minor caveat that isn't as annoying as Disney replacing their classic blue logo at the start of their animated classics. Gotta stop that, Disney.

The extras are mostly repeated from the previous 2 disc DVD (which is good) with the addition of a new critics round-table discussion called ""Breaking Down Jackie Brown"". The critics all love the film (including one who didn't like ""Pulp Fiction"" that much but loves this one) and their insights are all fun to hear. Other highlights include the retrospective documentary, a long interview with Tarantino where he talks about EVERYTHING, the Siskel & Ebert review, and, best of all, a huge gallery of vintage trailers featuring the two stars, Pam Grier and Robert Forster. Very cool. Still no commentary from QT but I wasn't expecting one. All in all, a great edition of a film that needs to be seen by more people.

1724973,5,B000068DBD,"""Jackie Brown,"" Quentin Tarantino's third feature length film, finds the writer/director at perhaps his most straight-forward and mature. While he rejects the notion that he is maturing as a film-maker in an interview featured on the DVD, it is quite obvious that the man who created such cult classics as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pulp-Fiction/dp/B00006BSBW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pulp Fiction</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Reservoir-Dogs/dp/B00008975Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Reservoir Dogs</a>&nbsp;was out to prove he wasn't merely a one-trick pony, and it paid off in one of his most character driven and rewarding efforts to date.

Adapted from the Elmore Leonard novel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rum-Punch/dp/0060082194/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rum Punch</a>, ""Jackie Brown"" is the story of an aging stewardess (Pam Grier) in trouble with the law who concocts a scheme to rip off an arms dealer (Samuel L. Jackson) of a cool $500,000. She of course needs the help of a bail bondsman (Robert Forster) whose midlife crisis takes a backseat to the crush he develops for her. On the surface, it appears to be just another heist film, but underneath all the layers, at its core, ""Jackie Brown"" is an unlikely love story from probably the last director you'd expect. While the job and the way it's carried out is a big part of the film, Tarantino knows well enough to allow his characters ample time to breathe, making it the sort of film where you forget for a while who you're watching and simply appreciate the unique personalities they bring to life.

It also helps, of course, that the film is filled to brim with a great cast of old and new, obscure and respectable. Robert De Niro has perhaps one of the most entertaining roles as an ex-con who keeps to himself, silently observing and judging the world he is getting reacquainted with. Bridget Fonda plays Samuel L. Jackson's sex-pot/pot-head surfer girl girlfriend with a dry sense of humor that bounces well off of De Niro's stone-cold demeanor. Grier and Forster, who were both dragged from the depths of obscurity only to find their careers slightly revitalized for the film are both in top form and go a long way in driving home the human nature of the plot. Michael Keaton, playing an ATF agent who would later appear as the same character in 1998's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Out-of-Sight/dp/B001VPJZLS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Out of Sight</a>, is perhaps one of the film's greatest surprises, as he is in turns quirky and overly confident, while being clueless all the while.

While fans of Tarantino's more notorious fare will have a hard time seeing the brilliance of ""Jackie Brown,"" it's a film that will no doubt please the palate of the viewer who craves rich characters, natural pacing and an engrossing plot, not to mention a killer soundtrack. Out of all of Tarantino's work, this is the one that is the most grounded in reality and, aside from Forster's Oscar nomination, deserved much more acclaim and credit than it was given. In a way, this is the cult classic in Tarantino's league of cult classics, and a film that certainly holds up time and time again.",1257120000,,3351,5.64484126984127

Leonard's lead in the novel Rum Punch was a white woman: he agreed that Tarantino's selection of Pam Grier, a fixture in many blaxploitation films, was the right person to play opposite Jackson. Coming between Pulp Fiction (1994) and Kill Bill (2003-4), this film has not gotten the attention it deserves.",1256428800,,578,4.621359223300971
1724975,4,B000068DBD,"You know, it's kind of too bad that Jackie Brown doesn't get much recongition amongst so-called Tarantino fans (being a fan, by the way, does not mean liking everything automatically), but it's a worthy candidate and still a Tarantino movie.  Tarantino is able to make great movies no matter what, and this movie is another testament to why I love this guys movies.  Sure, he isn't entirely original, but his movies are entertaining, and you don't need to understand such hopelessly trivial ""deep"" themes to understand.  Gah, _____ that.  The reason you should watch movies is the entertainment value, that's what matters so much.  Themes are there in real life, so you really don't need them in movies.  Sure, themes and social commentary make good movies, but liking movies even though they have a lack of meaning doesn't (of course, it helps to know, however, many mindless movies are actually more boring than movies with subtle meaning).  Just to be sure, Jackie Brown is a bit restrained but still has the Tarantino trademarks that we all know and love.  Here's the run down.

DIALOGUE 8/10

Is this the best dialogue Tarantino has ever done?  Probably not.  All of the dialogue is much better than usual, although, unlike Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs, plenty of the dialogue kind of moves the plot around, it's merely there to be there.  That's definitly not a bad thing, but I still am not going to give it all points all for that.  But then again, the characters do more than just talk about the situations; they react as well.  Some movies would just speak their lines and them move on.  In Jackie Brown, however, they speak after turn of events.  It makes everything a lot more human and a heck of a lot more fun to watch.  Example of this would be after Louis meets Melanie (middle of the movie), he talks with Jackson about the conversation they had.  And this movie doesn't suffer from third person syndrome either; the cast and characters do a great job in making sure this doesn't happen.

However, even though the sharp and cool dialogue that's oh so prevalant in Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs is toned down, there are still plenty of classic one liners and dialogue sets that are insanely quotable over and over again.  The chicks with guns segment at the beginning, the funny bickering between Jackson's and Chris Tucker's characters, and Jackson and Deniro's discussion on Melanie, to name a few.  Overall, this is great dialogue from Tarantino, and while not as good as some of his other movies, it still stands out with ease.

CHARACTERS 8/10

Tarantino once again gives off characters of interest, and while they are largely based off of Elmore Leonard's novel Rum Punch, I have not read the novel yet and I can't quite tell you what was changed and whatnot.  However, Jackie Brown features primarly black characters as a homage to Blaxplotation films, starting with the titular character played by Pam Grier and gun merchant Ordell Robbie played by Samuel L. Jackson changed into characters who were white in the novel.  I heard from a lot of people that the novel is great as well, but I have no experience with the novel.  However, the characters still stand out, and the acting makes it come to life even better.

Played by Pam Grier, the 44 year old stewardess is getting old and really can't leave her job.  Unlke a blaxplotation character that momumentally kicks @$$ and is basically a black persons, Pam Grier doesn't play this type of quasi-kung fu bad@$$.  Rather, she plays a real, tired, but tough and crafty middle age women who sees this as her last chance to finally get some money.  Her attitude is great, she has a liekable personality, and is up there with The Bride from Kill Bill.  She forms a bond with Max Cherry, played by Robert Forrester, who is like her in many ways.  The mutual undestanding between each other makes the movie have a good human element along with it's style, fun, and Tarantino trademarks with it.

Meanwhile, among the more fun characters include, well everybody else.  Bridget Fonda plays probably one of the most memorable characters in the Tarantino catalog, a beach girl stoner who lounges around in shorts and a bikini top all day, taking hits from bongs and watching television.  Her big mouth and attitude Samuel L. Jackson doesn't give quite the performance he did in Pulp Fiction, but still dynamite.  Chris Tucker's bickering is funny as heck, and the legendary Robert DeNiro plays a quiet, kind of shifty ex-con.  I could ramble on and on but it wouldn't be worth a damn anyway. It's another great set of Tarantino characters, and I'll be damned if they aren't memorable.

PLOT 8/10

I admit the characters make the plot more interesting, but this is still a plot that works very well on it's own.  The main plot revolves around a half million dollars in cash, which Jackie needs very much considering how much money she makes as a stewardess.  She sets up nearly everybody.  It's not that complicated, and it's not as human or prominent as the characters, but it's still a pretty smart plot that is worth viewing again and again.  It's pretty clever how Jackie sets up FBI Agent Ray Nicolette to get the money who pretty much uses Jackie to capture Ordell Robbie for smuggling guns.  I like the plot as far as I'm concered, and the plot is more of a story as well, events unfolding, problems coming up; Tarantino once again tells a story, and not merely a situation.  It's not an epic story, but still a good story anyway.

DIRECTING AND STYLE 20/20

While Jackie Brown is less than a cartoon character and more of a real, tired, 44 year old middle age woman, that's not to say Tarantino doesn't go with the style of the blaxplotation genre.  He does so with great ease, coming from much of the bright, sunny crime ridde area of LA, the and especially his music soundtrack, which is one of his best.  Using an amazing mix of soul, funk, and a couple of assorted oddities, Tarantino uses music not as a lame sense of drawing you in, but to really make the movie seen more effective anyway.  Music is supposed to be relatable to life anyway, and Tarantino knows this.  Not to mention it works in making the movie more of a blaxplotation film.  Furthermore, while not on the soundtrack, songs from Roy Ayer's films are used as well, which were used in many blaxplotation films such as Coffy.  It's nifty and witty, and works very well, and well, makes the movie a __________ blaxplotation movie.  What else is there to say anyway?

Jackie Brown is the Tarantino film that mostly goes over lot's of people's heads, but it is no less entertaining in many ways (although it's not as good as Pulp Fiction, obviously).  Don't be fooled by Jackie Brown's different approach and black sheep persona of the Tarantino canon, it's just one of his charms that his movies seem to be black sheeps when compared to certain others.  In any case, ignoring this fine work would be kind of futile.  Those who don't like Tarantino will not like it, but if you are a fan, you won't be disappointed, as long as you don't expect Pulp Fiction.  However, expect that Tarantino touch, and expect his directing, the great soundtrack, the colorful and likeable characters, his great crime plots, the genre blurring, and so on.  So get it.",1251849600,,7292,4.672156862745098

1724977,5,B000068DBD,"Jackie Brown is Quentin Tarantino's best film. There is not a single note wrong here from beginning to end. Dogs was a rough start, Pulp was a crowd pleaser, but with Jackie Brown, there are characters that are more than pawns in a game of ""Guess what movie I ripped off...""

The awesome cast is firing on all cylinders to give the movie a real backbone. Surprisingly only Robert De Niro's presence comes off out of place in his nearly wordless role.

The film works better on more levels than any other Tarantino. Why? Three main reasons;

He is working from a completely realized story from Elmore Leonard. Tarantino has never shown himself to be much with a singular story over 2 hours, Leonard's Rum Punch gave him a solid foundation to work from.

He is free of gimmicks of black and white suits, glossy guns or samurai swords. There are almost no way to quantify his filmic references here, but they are all completely in sync with the story and characterizations, not for flamboyance. The story and characters rule here.

Most importantly...

He is hopelessly in love with almost every character in this film and it feels as if he KNOWS each of these people. The personal touches for each of the players here are well done by the actors, but Tarantino simply worships them with his words, his camera and his soundtrack. This film could easily be called ""Reverence.""

More than 10 years on, Jackie Brown feels fresher and far more mature than a re-watch of his other films, which by comparison come off as wind up toys or forced. On the other hand, Jackie Brown is a true love song to Pam Grier, the 70s and Blaxploitation and movies in general.

Indeed, an initial viewing may leave you with the impression that ""Jackie Brown"" suffers from a sketchy plot and lackluster action.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  While ""Jackie Brown"" covers familiar ""Pulp Fiction"" territory, Tarantino emphasizes characterization at the expense of ultra-violence and implausibility.  Furthermore, ""Jackie Brown"" may be Tarantino's most accomplished film in terms of visual storytelling and the performances are simply unforgettable.

Veteran African-American actress Pam Grier, who made a name for herself during the 1970s with blaxploitation movies such as ""The Big Doll House"" (1971) and ""Coffy"" (1973), plays the eponymous heroine.  As a 44-year old woman, Jackie works as a flight attendant for the worst airline, a shuttle that flies between the United States and Mexico.  Life has not exactly been rosy for Jackie.  She resorts to smuggling large sums of U.S. currency into the country that belongs to a treacherous arms dealer, Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson of ""Pulp Fiction"") who stashes his cash in Cabo San Lucas.  As the film opens, prickly ATF agent Ray Nicolette (Michael Keaton of ""Batman"") busts Jackie for sneaking $50-thousand in past customs.  Nicolette and his LAPD partner Mark Dargus (Michael Bowen of ""Iron Eagle"") put the squeeze on her, especially after they discover a two ounce baggie of cocaine hidden in with the bucks.

Jackie finds herself in jail, and Robbie posts her bond.  Robbie hires bail bondsman Max Cherry (Robert Forster of ""Medium Cool"") to spring her.  Robbie follows an unmistakable pattern.  Paranoid about going back to jail, Robbie ices any of his cohorts who come into contact with the law.  Jackie got busted thanks to a tip the cops squeezed out of Robbie's low-life henchman Beaumount (Chris Tucker of ""Rush Hour"").  After Cherry gets Beaumont out of jail, Robbie kills Beaumont and hides the corpse in the trunk of an abandoned car.  Robbie is so leery of his buddies that he brings in an old-time convicted bank robber, Lewis Gara (Robert De Niro of ""Goodfellas"") and uses him for his latest scheme.

Once out of jail, Jackie cooperates with the ATF.  She plans to bring in more of Robbie's dough and be a part of a sting against him.  She tell Robbie what the law wants her to do and then presents him with a deal that will get him the rest of his money.  She'll bring in all his money at once when the cops aren't expecting it, and they'll pull a switch before the fuzz could figure it out.  Robbie is leery again, but eventually he agrees.  Meanwhile, Jackie pulls a fast one not only on the cops but also Robbie and get away with a fortune in cold cash.  She devises another plan with Max Cherry.

While there are no overlapping plots, ""Jackie Brown"" is Tarantino's best job of writing.  He lays the story out in clear, simple terms and never needlessly complicates the action as he did in ""Pulp Fiction.""  You won't get lost in the middle of this action comedy.  Of course, the language is as corrosive as all get out.  The F-word is used at least 131 times, and the S-word is heard as many as 69 times.  Tarantino's fans will appreciate the usual profane, inane dialogue that he writes so well, especially Robbie's instructions to Gara about how to unlock his car.

Written and directed by Tarantino, ""Jackie Brown"" is based on best-selling novelist Elmore Leonard's novel ""Rum Punch,"" published in 1992.  Surprisingly, Tarantino removed two major shoot-outs that add bang-bang action to Leonard's book.  Robbie wants to kill a Nazi skin head and heist his huge arsenal of firearms.  What might have made for a distinctively ""Pulp Fiction"" moment, however, Tarantino scrapped.  Tarantino also eliminated a gunfight between Nicolette and Robbie's gunmen.  Usually, Hollywood filmmakers go out of their way to beef up Leonard's novel.  Consider the horrendous misfire that Burt Reynolds produced from Leonard's entertaining novel ""Stick.""  While ""Stick"" boasted the trademark Leonard dialogue (he c0-scripted), the movie featured violence that the book did not contain.  Although Tarantino doesn't capture the quirky Leonard dialogue, he does a better job of transferring ""Rum Punch"" to the screen than either Reynolds did with ""Stick"" or Barry Sonnenfeld with ""Get Shorty.""

As Jackie Brown, busty Pam Grier is ideally cast.  Originally written for an Ann-Margret type (in ""Rum Punch"" she was named Jackie Burke), Tarantino has changed the racial composition of the heroine but retains the spirit of Leonard's heroine.  ""Jackie Brown"" is one of those pictures where the heroine isn't fresh out of a Playboy centerfold, though Grier has the obvious endowments.  Instead, Tarantino uses her as a woman caught in the middle that wants and deserves to get out of a bad situation.  Compared with previous Tarantino efforts, ""Jackie Brown"" represents a definite feminist turn of the screw.

The supporting cast is both diverse and fantastic.  Although Robert Forster has almost vanished from the screen, his performance as Max Cherry is so good and straightforward--in a poker-faced way--that you forget that Forster is acting.  Cherry may qualify as one of the few tough-guy male heroes who could serve as a role model.  Meanwhile, Robert De Niro brings his customary thespian skill to his bank robber thug and delivers a fastidious performance that relies on his physical presence. Lastly, Chris Tucker has only a few moments on screen, but he is infectiously funny in his brief appearance.

""Jackie Brown"" lasts over two hours, but nothing obstructs the straight ahead plotting.  If you're counting, only three characters get shot, and Tarantino stages each shooting incident off-screen or is shown from an angle that prevents the viewer from seeing much gore and violence.",1235260800,,6191,5.098311817279047

Not adult as in skinflick, but adult in writing and maturity.  The characters are just fabulously intrinsic and well-developed.  If you don't like Jackie Brown, it's because you need everything laid out for you, and spelled out for you. It's an intense ride, but it's a ride that you need to take.  It's for ""real"" film lovers, not flash in the pan viewers who expect everyone to be young, cute and easy to read.

No, it's not because anything  bad happend to me at 2:30 but because I just realized that I had been watching one of the worst films ever made, for an entire TWO AND A HALF HOURS! That's what I deserve for going near anything that Tarantino got within 100 yards of... OK, I liked Pulp Fiction & Dusk Til' Dawn & thought Natural Born Killers was GREAT. Thank GOD he only wrote the script for NBK, otherwise it would have been ""Kill Bill Meets Death Proof"" UGGGGGGG.

  For the love of god everyone, just go buy a VHS of Dolemite and get it out of your system. Why settle for pseudo 70's blackspoitation when you can have the real deal? It's because of the offensive things in those films that we don't want to remember like sideburns, Afros and paisley bell bottoms isn't it? This movie is the perfect example of how his mock 70's style of shooting and his obscure Motown soundtracks wore out their welcome around the time that Madonna did. It's a one trick pony, PLEASE SHOOT IT ALREADY.

  Let's face it, if Tarantino would have released the EXACT same movie under a different name, with a cast of unknowns, this movie would have been given the credit it deserves... a TWO AND A HALF HOUR remake of an episode of ""the Rockford Files"". There were some very interesting parts in this film that PADDED the stale plot like: ""SEE Robert de Niro take bong hits for 10 minutes!"", ""Take a virtual tour of the BIGGEST mall in the world for 25 minutes (includes PARKING LOT!!!)!"", ""WATCH Pam Grier smoke half a pack of Cigarettes and lip sync!""

If you see Quinton around, be sure to BURN him like you Samuel L Jackson!",1229385600,,2181,4.3654320987654325
1724989,5,B000068DBD,"Quinton Tarantino is one of those directors you either love or hate, but there is no denying that he has talent, and what makes his talent even more obvious is his rich sense of style.  Tarantino has a very unique charm that he layers his films with, giving them such warm originality.

Much like with directors Baz Luhrmann and David Fincher, a Quinton Tarantino film is undeniably a film by Quinton Tarantino.

With that said; the fact that some have criticized `Jackie Brown' for being a change of pace or unlike Tarantino's more successful films (`Pulp Fiction' and `Reservoir Dogs') is rather preposterous, for if you truly look at the film in all it's technical aspects you can't help but see Tarantino shining through in every frame.

It bares his name, thus it bares his soul.

The film tells the story of Ordell Robbie; arms dealer.  Ordell is a ruthless man who takes nothing from no one, so when stewardess Jackie Brown is arrested smuggling Ordell's money he immediately takes the defensive.  He contacts bail bondsman Max Cherry in order to bail Jackie out, but his plans to kill her are thwarted when she proposes a deal.  Ordell is trying to smuggle in a half-million dollars into the states, and he was planning on using Jackie to do so; yet the feds have already offered Jackie a deal of her own, if she can give them Ordell.  Working both sides she concocts a plan where she can `get out of jail free', keep her life and (if all goes right) keep the money.

The film is littered with great performances by a slew of talented actors.  Pam Grier steps into the lead role of Jackie Brown, and she manages to create a masterfully layered woman.  She is smart, witty and strong, yet she gives her layers of fragility which help establish this woman's true nature.  Samuel L. Jackson, who also worked with Tarantino (and managed an Oscar nomination) in `Pulp Fiction', plays Ordell Brown with the same quick witted sense of humor with which he played Jules Winnfield.  He is engaging and hilarious and somewhat scary.  The combination works just as well the second go around.  Robert Forster (who received an Oscar nomination for his performance) gives Max Cherry a marvelous sense of honesty that comes of rather pure in this film filled with double crossing liars and manipulators.  His character is the richest of the bunch, in the subtlest of ways.

The supporting cast, including Robert De Niro, Bridget Fonda, Michael Keaton and Chris Tucker, are all on the top of their game, especially De Niro who almost feels like a simpleton yet he builds (gradually) layers of intelligence into his character.

`Jackie Brown' is not as abrasive as `Pulp Fiction' or `Reservoir Dogs', but to say that it is Tarantino-lite is a false statement.  This film may be a little slower, but that is only to build on the strong characters.  The thing is, the scope of Jackie Brown is a lot simpler than that of `Pulp Fiction', which threw a large amount of characters into a twisting plot, whereas `Jackie Brown' focuses on a few characters in one plot and thus allows more time for us to engage in these particular characters and get to know them.  Tarantino has a knack for dialog, and this film is no exception for the mere interactions between characters is what makes this film so much fun.

It's a slightly different approach, but the construction and delivery is all Tarantino.",1226534400,,3381,4.702886247877759
1724990,4,B000068DBD,"4 and 1/2 Stars.

The story of a 44 yr old black woman struggling to get over a criminal past and a mid-life crisis serves as an unlikely follow-up to Quentin Tarantino's enormously successful 'Pulp Fiction'. This film, a much more character driven piece, is probably his most realistic and linear of the five he's completed.

The plot revolves around a gun-runner's attempt to traffic his money while being pressured by the ATF. But the clever part of the movie has to do with it's shift from the initial plot to the lives and relationships of it's characters (all of which come off very naturally). And because the pleasure of the movie lies in the relationships and dialogue of the characters (all of which is dynamic and plot-driven), the film is ripe for repeated viewings.

There's not much else to say here. The movie is very entertaining. The heist plot is terrific but the 'hang-out' scenes really make the film great, utilizing incredible dialogue and acting prowess (otherwise unseen from this group of actors and actresses, sans DeNiro) to tell a typical genre story in a much more subtle and personal way.

Funny, sly, clever, the movie is thoroughly enjoyable. Recommended.",1224374400,,1187,4.890547263681592
1724991,5,B000068DBD,Jackie Brown is one of the most underrated movies to be released in 1997. Quentin Tarantino made a gritty adult film which featured one of the most underrated actress of the sevnties Pam Grier. While the film isn't as violent as Dogs or Fiction. Samuel L.

1724994,5,B000068DBD,"I'll start with the soundtrack.  Some movies are very much influenced and remembered for the soundtrack.  Such examples of that would certainly be `Jaws' & `Psycho'.  Background music is important, or lack there of, as is the case in the 2007 hit `No Country For Old Men', and so we tend to pay attention to it.  In the case of Jackie Brown, the influence of the 70's musical touch creates a setting that compels us to maintain our focus, more so than with your run-of-the-mill movie.  The music hooks us from the opening credits and never stops.

The acting in Jackie Brown is fantastic.  There isn't a character in this movie that you don't believe or buy into.  Samuel Jackson stunned me with his powerful performance and Robert De Niro has mastered the bit of a dim-witted, always high, ex-con.  Together they dominate the screen with their plans to become successful gun dealers during the 80's.

What Quentin Tarantino does better than any other director, is he assembles a cast of actors who are able to portray characters which force the audience to both love and hate them at the same time.  It doesn't matter whether the character is supposed to be good or evil, at some point during the movie; you're going to think of that character as both or either.  You'll find yourself getting disgusted with the character and then laughing at or with them, sometimes in the same scene.

Perhaps the greatest aspect of Tarantino's movies is that of the dialogue.  Sure his movies are graphic and filled with more twists than a gun barrel, but what makes them click, and none better than Jackie Brown, is the dialogue.  The characters give it to you hard and fast and you believe them.  While Pulp Fiction & the Kill Bill movies gained the most recognition, Jackie Brown is his sleeper masterpiece that puts them all to shame when it comes to the script.  If there was an academy award category for dialogue - Jackie Brown would be a runaway nominee.

Jackie Brown is one of those movies that you don't need to put together, or try to figure out what is going on.  That is a step away from what we have come to associate Tarantino with, but it works perfectly with Jackie Brown.  We're allowed to simply sit back, watch, listen and enjoy a bunch of shady characters as they try to swindle and kill each other off - all in the name of the almighty dollar.

Jackie Brown is a thrilling ride and certainly one that you will enjoy watching more than once.",1203379200,,2450,4.560640732265446

Jackson is terrific, as a manic yet terrifying killer whose ambition is to make lots of money no matter what the price for any associates. Literally under the gun from both sides with the police (played by Keaton and Michael Brown) with Jackson puttimg pressure from the other side, Grier plays a smart, wiley and sympathetic woman who plans to not only survive but take a desperate attempt at financial freedom. Robert Forster, plays her empathetic bondsman and potential love interst, if not friend, who knows the criminal justice system and virtually acts as her mentor and consultant. The interplay between Forster and Grier play off extremley well against the fearsome street smart Jackson.

1725005,5,B000068DBD,"I love Tarantino's style, which is powered as much by mood as by story line.  I have viewed this film at least a dozen times now, and it has made me laugh and feel anxious with every single viewing.  In this film, rather than violence for its own sake or a strangely parallel universe of plausible if impossible crime, you get really good characters in an unusual situation.

There is Jackie, the seemingly normal woman at the center of the film who turns out to be as cool as a cumcumber and a superb manipulator.  She is wonderfully subtle in her desperation, as much financial as middle aged and not wanting to start over again.  Then there is Max, a burntout bail bondsman who chooses to help her because he loves her in a very mature and low-key way.  With Ordell, you get a great foul-mouthed bad guy, with hilarious dialogue, dim wits, and style.  He moves things along with his menacing presence, greed, and alcoholic rage.  His hangers-on are also splendidly eccentric and dumb.  Finally, there are the young cops who are enjoying ""playing the cop"", as Cherry puts it.  This mix offers a uniquely balanced chemistry of characters that are not in the slightest sterotypical, but quirky and entirely believable.

The greatest thing that Tarantino did was to cast Grier and Forster, two has-beens who give remarkable performances even though they are not young anymore.  They are so good that they eclipse the wonderful work of the others, which is also first rate.  Again, they capture the mood of the time, and their age anxieties, extremely well.  The drama is mature, not the usual bust-em-up adolescent fare.  This is so rare.

FInally, there is the wonderfully intricate plot.  Here, the details really matter, and you can view the film many times to piece Jackie's entire plan together in its wonderful and very dangerous orchestration.  While some reviewers say it feels too static, I found the tension subtle and far more convincing than anything else that Tarantno has done - never outlandish, but taut.  In this, he tells a story that could really happen, right down to the ambiguous ending.

This is by far my favorite Tarantino film and one of the best I have ever seen, a genuine master[iece.  It is unlike any other film noir you will ever find, because of the fine work of Grier and Forester.  You will not get a formula here, but a solid drama that is very scary and very funny.

Jackson, Pam Grier and Robert De Niro) and delivered the action-crime caper Jackie Brown. Jackie is a flight attendant who smuggles cash on the side. When busted and pressured to help with an investigation, she plans to play the opposing forces against each other and walk away with the dough.

I loved Tarentino's other work but I feel that Jackie Brown has the most style. It's the coolest because it's about a women getting justice without getting out the guns and it's also funny, Michael Keaton steals the show for me. But what I think I like the best is the understated romance of the Forrester and Brown and the dialogue that just flows so freely like your ease dropping on a private moment. Tarentino is known for his characters having everyday conversations about banal things and this movie really hits all the rights notes with those conversations. Of course he aided by Leonard's book `Rum Punch'. Again it is violent though less so than his earlier but again the violence has a style that some how seem to become humorous while being totally horrific. I think the reason I like it is because out of all his films it is the most restrained and least flashy while oozing so much cool you could make ice cream",1169164800,,1352,4.680672268907563

1725011,5,B000068DBD,"I'm really into blaxploitation films and I have seen most of Pam Grier's movies from the 1970s. ""Jackie Brown"" brought Grier back into the spotlight and has to be one of her best roles to date. This was a modern blaxploitation flim, which paid homage to 1970s blaxploitation flicks as well as to Pam Grier. There were a few references to Grier in ""Jackie Brown."" The song ""Long Time Woman"" played in the scene when Jackie was in jail was actually performed by Grier for the movie she starred in called ""Black Mama, White Mama"" (1972). In the scene where Jackie and Max Cherry were talking about growing old, he noted she probably looks the same she did back then except she had an Afro I did not find this movie ""disappointing.""  There was not a lot of rash bloodshed, but mostly a lot of dialogue that included scheming. If you wanted to know what was going on the movie, you had to have paid attention to what the characters were saying, which led to their actions. Jackie Brown and Max Cherry were two characters I found to be ""real"" enough to relate to and the chemistry between them was great. Samuel L. Jackson gave an awesome performance (as usual) and the beginning of the movie with him and Chris Tucker was hilarious. The soundtrack was definitely of the hook- ""Inside Me Love"" by Minnie Riperton; ""Strawberry Letter 23"" by The Brothers Johnson; ""Natural High"" by Bloodstone, and you can't forget The Delfonics!

I know it sounds confusing, but it's really quite fun.  I was pleasantly suprised the first time I viewed it and each time after that.

I have never been a huge fan of Mr. Tarantino's films.  However, this happens to be one of my favorite films period!  It is the only film by QT that I own on DVD and I have probably seen the film at least ten times now.  Pam Grier is everything you want in a leading lady - sexy, sassy, strong, sophisticated, smart, etc... I could not imagine anyone else playing the role of Jackie.  Samuel L. Jackson is absolutely hilarious throughout as the film's villian, and this is one of his best performances.  There is a scene between he and Chris Tucker (in a cameo role) that is so funny it brings me to tears everytime I view it.  Deniro is also great as SLJ's neer-do-well right hand man (then again, when isn't he great?).  Bridget Fonda who usually stinks up the screen is a hoot as SLJ's stoner surfer girlfriend.  The whole cast is terrific!  However, it's the likeable, understated performance of Robert Forster as bailbondsman Max Cherry that shines above all the other great performances.  He really makes you feel for his character and it's almost impossible to not like him.  It was nice to see the Academy acknowledge his performance with an Oscar nomination for his supporting role (he should have won though!).

Overall, the film is excellent.  I also appreciated the fact that the movie did not have as much graphic violence as the majority of QT's films.  There is however a whole lot of f-bombs throughout, and the use of the ""N"" word more times than you can count.  However, that being said, the writing overall is excellent and so to is the directing.  I also enjoyed the great 70's music!",1168041600,,1906,4.619047619047619

1725017,5,B000068DBD,"That is coming from someone who love anything this director makes, presents, or endorses.  I think this is a very complex and satisfying film.  Using the relatively unfilmed cities of LA, such as Hawthorne, Compton, the REAL Hollywood, it utilizes a more down to earth approach to real world crime.  This isn't about a multimillion dollar heist, and the criminals are likeable and genuinely interesting even if one or two are full of themselves (Namely Ordell and Melanie.)  The film opens with the classic Across 110th Street as sung by Bobby Womack and featuring a strong Pam Grier, walking that moving sidewalk at LAX.  As the opening progresses she ends up possessing a look of worry on her face that shows a VERY strong woman's strength become vulnerablity.  From then on we meet a handful of excentric baddies and law enforcers, that are all likeable, interesting and have at least one or two funny lines (with the exception of the cop who isn't Michael Keaton, who is just a plain jackass cowboy cop)  My favorite part is the friendship/romance between Pam and the subtle and sensational Robert Forster.  Starting with a very special ride home, which bleeds to a bar, and then to Griers Apartment.  All involve rich dialogue and interest shown.  They bond thru body language, their age, and eventually music(""The Del----Fonics"".) The fact that Forster rushes to the nearest record store for his first Delfonics Tape is just plain cute, and shows he is falling for her music and all.  The Scenes between Grier and Sam Jackson also need recognition.  They are at times funny, terrifying, and very well acted.  There is also Robert DiNiro as an old friend/partner to Jackson, and a few girlfriends of ordell's such as Surfer Girl/PotHead Melanie, Old sex siren Simone, and Super Slow Country Girl Sheronda.  There is just a bunch of rich characters here, and they all give great parts no matter how big or how small...especially Chris Tucker, who's performance as a snitch is equal parts brilliant and hilarious.  This movie just hits a right note for anyone interested in a talky, rich picture.  Tarantino says this is a movie for older people, well at 19, I'm definitely not younger, but this is my favorite of all tarantino films, be it because of the great soundtrack, storyline, performances, direction it makes no difference.

1725021,5,B000068DBD,"It may be old news now, but Quentin T. showed out in this fast and sassy maxi-scam caper flick. He couldn't have hired a better acting ensemble to pull this off, to wit, Pam Grier, Robert Forster, Sammy J., Bobby D., Brigid F., Chris Tucker, Michael K., etc.

 For starters, I think this is the best performance of Pam G's career: she exhibits a multi-dimensional personna here I have never seen her pull off before.  Notice how she effortlessly segues from the street-savvy demeanor whilst in the company of Sammy J., etc., to the middle-class, nice girl, good-diction modus operandi when she's in the company of the the likes of Robert F., for example.  She shows how tight her game really is and isn't afraid to do whatever it takes to pull off her intended caper.

  Robert F., mild of manner and well composed, is cast as the antithesis of the Sammy J. character who is a down-and-dirty, bombastic rascal. Notice how Robert F's character, a white bail-bondsman, effortlessly mixes in well with people of color without being obsequious or trying to be hip: He is merely himself and lets that fact set the tone for whatever may ensue.

 Sammy J. is his usual awesome self, with great support from Bobby D. and Brigid F. That unholy trio makes sparks fly as the drama unfolds. Notice how Bobby D's character slowly shifts gears from a mellow understated ex-con to a violent shooter when he becomes unduly provoked: a nice touch from Mr. DeNiro.

  Quentin T's usually crisp directorial skills are in evidence here, as his cutting in and moving back and forth in time work very well. His rewinds in time allow the viewer to see the same scenes from another vantage point so that one can see the logical progression of events from several angles. All that and an awesome, cleverly positioned soundtrack that kicks much booty!  How about ""Across 110th Street"" at the ending? Did she ""get across"" or what?!

1725022,5,B000068DBD,"No individual has done more to degrade, besmirch, and corrupt modern American cinema than Quentin Tarantino. He is derivative at best, a plagiarist at worst. His one contribution to the genre is making movies more obsessively violent and grotesque than they already are. His one subject, already exhausted before he arrived, is gangster life. He tirelessly perpetuates the myth than criminals and other violent edge-dwellers are ""cool.""

Tarantino's strength is in structuring a screenplay, the best example of this is the hideously cynical Pulp Fiction. (Pulp Fiction, which had great moments and great cameos, rode on the shoulders of Samuel Jackson's amazing performance. To its eternal discredit it revived the career of a then forgotten John Travolta, about whom, the less said the better.)

Jackie Brown is the one movie where QT got it right. The pace is slow and the audience gets a chance to know and care about the characters. Pam Grier and Robert Forster are superb as unremarkable people caught in an extraordinary squeeze. Jackson is so smooth that he is creepy and laughable all at once.

For a welcome change, the violence is mainly off-screen. QT would do well to remember that you don't need to kill 100 people with a sword to make a movie interesting, especially if all 100 are two-dimensional. All you really need is one character the audience cares about. Pam Grier as Jackie Brown is such a character, so is Forster's Max Cherry. By the end you really do wish it were possible for them to ride off into the sunset.",1136073600,,1535,4.8961538461538465

Not that I didn't love ""Pulp,"" and it was certainly the more groundbreaking of the two films, but there's something about the social milieu and style of ""Jackie Brown"" that makes me want to revisit it more often. Maybe it's the ensemble work of a great cast; maybe it's the leisurely pace; maybe it's the humor that simultaneously undercuts and sets up the moments of violence; maybe it's Pam Grier's winning performance as a flight attendant who outsmarts the good guys and the bad guys at the same time; maybe it's Robert Forster's comeback portrayal of a weathered bail bondsman; or maybe it's Tarantino's underlying commentary on the crime genre, which Hollywood so often populates with brilliant masterminds or bumbling goofballs, when in fact most criminals are much like these - average, drug-addled, and not the world's great thinkers. It certainly has something to do with Samuel L. Jackson's astonishingly assured turn as Ordell Robbie, an arms dealer who is twice as dangerous as he looks and half as smart as he thinks he is. Somehow it all works perfectly, and the extras on this DVD only add to the value. As Jackie would say, ""Boo yah!""",1135123200,,1237,4.895238095238096

The movies have nothing to do with one another, and Jackie Brown stands alone as a superb crime drama, based on Elmore Leonard's novel Rum Punch.  The cast is outstanding, from Samuel L. Jackson's ultra-smooth gun dealer character, to Robert de Niro playing a stoned out aging criminal, Pam Grier getting her due in screen time in the title role, and Robert Forster as the conflicted bailbondsman Max Cherry.  If one complaint were to be made about the movie, it is that it drags a bit in places.  Tarentino seems to go for a little too much dramatic effect with long scenes of a character walking or driving accompanied by the 1970's soundtrack.  The rest of the movie is so excellent, though, that a few slow scenes can be overlooked and won't detract from my 5-star rating.

The Collector's Edition is a must-own for any fan.  It is absolutely chock-full of extras, commentary, and information (including a retro movie poster!).  5 stars to the bonus material.",1134864000,,1042,4.75
1725025,5,B000068DBD,"I saw ""Jackie Brown"" for the first time a few days ago, and I loved it. I had never heard anything about it before seeing it, so I didn't really have many expectations, but to be honest I put the movie on originally because it was a Quentin Tarantino film. I sat through the whole movie, and was not disapointed once. True, it was a slow paced movie, but I think it is unfair to expect it to be a fast paced action movie just because it was a Tarantino film... after all, if everyone just kept making the same kind of movie over and over again, I have to say it would get tired very quickly.

I think that the casting was superb, and I got a good laugh when I saw Beaumont (Chris Tucker) argue with Ordell (Samuel L. Jackson), and many other laughs out of almost every scene that Samuel L. Jackson was in (it seems that these are always his best roles, but I cannot complain, because I think that Ordell was one of the coolest movie characters in the history of film). The casting of other greats like Pam Grier and Robert De Niro (although his role was minor in the film, a few of his scenes were superb, like the car park and his scenes in Melanie's house) were great choices, and they all played their characters well.

This movie was definitly not an action film, but it managed to keep me quite hooked until the end and I am picking up the DVD this weekend.

I can tell you easy. It was done too dead-pan, too serious. It felt at times dull, at times forced. Look at Tarrantino's better recieved films...Resevior Dogs, Pulp Fiction, and Kill Bill Vol I, & II. Those films never took themselves too seriously, not even Resevior Dogs.

With clear influences of the 70's blaxpoitation flicks, in which Pam Grier is a veteran of, Tarantino treats us with a story of a washed up and mid-aged flight attendant named Jackie Brown who gets stuck in a spiderweb scheme involving the cops, her illegal weapons salesman associate Ordell, and a bailbondsman named Max Cherry to get their hands on a huge sum of cash that belongs to Ordell and that Jackie trafficks into the country unchecked.

Congratulations, your mom says she's proud.

Perhaps tea time prevented you form checking out the extras DVD included in the package... oh wait, you reviewed the VHS edition.  Well, if you had done a lick of research, you'd've discovered that, *GASP*, Quentin grew up in black culture.  Yeah, he had black friends and even went to schools populated heavily by black kids.  And get this... you ready?... his mother dated... black guys!  Now sit back, breathe in a bit, and utilize that liberal arts education I'm assuming you were at least exposed to, if not got a degree in: Artists - like Quentin - draw on their personal experiences in an effort to create an authentic piece of work.  Heap on those pile of words.

How can a director be a lustful, minstrel-show-seeking culture-exploiter if he uses Bobby Womack, The Delfonics, Randy Crawford, Brothers Johnson, and Minnie Riperton in the score?  Quentin didn't get any help with the script.  That scene between Ordell and Beaumont on the balcony outside the latter's apartment was written by a white guy.  Not even the most overzealous white-guy-wanting-desperately-more-than-anything-else-but-to-be-black could create something so sonically deft and authentic.  A scene like that shows how Quentin is a respectful student of black culture, not some hand-wringing, cigar-smoking WASP wanting to take rap and use it in a Fruity Pebbles commercial at the height of RUN-DMC's success in the late 80s so he can sell more cereal for General Mills.

Music and dialogue carry this movie and are the two ingredients that make it such a pleasure to take in.  The film's been described as ""slow-moving,"" but people who say that don't realize that the pace is purposefully done slow so one can enjoy each characters' interactions.  Sam Jackson's character, for as messed up as he is, is a piece of art.  Charismatic dialogue.  That's why I've watched the movie 3 times already, having seen it for the first time about a month ago.

1725032,4,B000068DBD,"This was the last film I watched that Quentin made(unless you count his segment in Four Rooms). The Kill Bill films were good but severe editing was needed. Reservoir Dogs was entertaining when it involved the escape from the heist and in the warehouse but the extra stuff dragged it. And Pulp Fiction is one of the better films of the 90's but to me, repeated viewings isn't very kind to it. So we have Jackie Brown which is the mark of a director maturing, unfortunately a little successfully so.

Ordell is an illegal gun salesman. He's got half a million in Mexico and his friend Jackie Brown just got out of jail so since feds are after him, she says that since she works as a flight attendant, she'll get the money and smuggle it in. Ordell's friend Louis and her stoner bunny friend Melanie might also be after the money. Not to mention one of the feds and Ordell's bondsman Max.

Some people were disappointed when the film came out because it wasn't as visceral as Reservoir Dogs or entertaining as Pulp Fiction but in a sense he tops Pulp Fiction in a way. This one actually gets better on repeated viewings while I kind of start to get antsy when Butch gets captured by Zed. If there's one thing that Jackie Brown doesn't do is make it's 2 and a half hour running time fly by. There were times where I thought the credits would come up only it kept going.

As for performances, the best ones are oddly the ones who have barely done work. Pam Grier and Robert Forrester are great in their roles. Samuel L. Jackson as usual as that kind of ***hole I'm the man persona who starts to get more monster-like as the movie goes on. Surprisingly, Chris Tucker in a very bit role(I'm talking at least 10 minutes if that) is quite good.

The DVD extras are similar to Pulp Fiction's(and thankfully not Reservoir Dogs I mean come on? A radio station? Action figures?) One of the better ones is a big sitdown with Quentin Tarantino in an interview with a somewhat audible interviewer. It's interesting and oddly enough, he can sound like a black person can sound.

1725033,5,B000068DBD,"Quentin Tarantino's ""Jackie Brown"" had a bad reputation because of Quentin's earlier film, ""Pulp Fiction"". Most of the violence that was in ""Pulp Fiction"" is gone, but there is much more story in this brilliant adaptation of a classic novel written by Elmore Leanord called ""Rum Punch"".

One of Quentin Tarantino's usual actors, Samuel L. Jackson returns as the character Ordell. And apparently it's always been a dream of Tarantino's to work with the legendary Pam Grier. And she plays, you guessed it, Jackie Brown. Personally, I've never read Elmore Leanord's classic book. But, since I watched ""Jackie Brown"" on the I.F.C. channel, I know I will read it soon.

""Jackie Brown"" tells the story of an illegal gunsalesman, Ordell and one of his best friends, Jackie. He has a half a million dollars from his sales stashed in Mexico. And Jackie is a stewardess and she knew where the money was, so, now, the money is pretty much floating around. And Jackie got in a little law trouble recently. A federal officer played by Michael Keaton is suspecting her of drug use and robbery. But Ordell got her out of jail. Now, even if Ordell's friend Louis, Jackie, his girlfriend Melanie or somebody else gets killed, it's all about the money.

""Jackie Brown"" features great preformances by especially Pam Grier, and, well, all the actors do extravagent work. The Collector's Edition DVD is what any fan of the movie cannot do without. ""The documentary Jackie Brown: How It Went Down is basically a vacuous cast-and-crew lovefest, but their enthusiasm is genuine, and the other bonus features are consistently worthwhile. A 54-minute interview with Quentin Tarantino seems excessive until you fully appreciate the writer-director's passionate devotion to movies and movie knowledge; film students are advised to listen attentively. The gem of the bunch, however, is the complete ""Chicks with Guns"" infomercial that's partially seen in Jackie Brown; it's like the NRA meets the Snap-on tools calendar girls! For those seeking pop-cultural perspective, trailers for films starring Robert Forster and Pam Grier demonstrate the rigors of survival in Hollywood, making their Jackie Brown comebacks even more gratifying.

Based On famed crime author Elmore Leonard's ""Rum Punch"" Pam Grier of the 70's black explotation craze is an flight attendent who gets mixed up with a gunrunner, FBI and a bail bondsman over a stash of millon dollars which is brought in illegaly into the U.S  Apart from the music and great actors the film is weak and often times fails misrably to sustain the audeience's attention to views these moraly corrutpetd indidvduals for nearly 2 hours. Now i see why it did poorly at the box office. But I must admit Pam Grier Is still one hot looking woman after all these years but her sexy persona and charm isn't enough to save this film.",1119312000,,933,4.520710059171598
1725035,5,B000068DBD,"For his third film, which followed the delirious success of Pulp Fiction, writer/director Quentin Tarantino did something different.  Using Elmore Leonard's novel Rum Punch, Tarantino molds the author's material into his own with Jackie Brown, relying more on dialogue and story then on the kinetic energy that helped him make a name for himself with Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs.  Revolving around the title character, played by blaxploitation survivor Pam Grier, Jackie is a flight attendant with a problem.  While transporting money for Ordell (Samuel L. Jackson), she is caught by the FBI, and in an effort to save herself, plays both sides to her advantage.  Among the mix are a wily Fed (Michael Keaton) looking to bring in Ordell, Ordell's doped up beach bunny girl (Bridget Fonda), his fresh from jail partner (Robert De Niro), and bail bondsman Max Cherry (Robert Forster in his Oscar nominated role) who is both attracted to, and compelled to help, Jackie in her survival.  Grier, Jackson, and Forster are perfectly cast, but perhaps the most understated performance comes from De Niro in a subtle yet complex role as a newly free criminal re-discovering the world.  Like Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, and his recent Kill Bill films, Tarantino's Jackie Brown isn't for everyone, but the man's talent for storytelling and dialogue and the performances from the key players help make his third film a masterpiece on par with his other modern day classics.  Much like the Special Edition of Pulp Fiction (released around the same time as this DVD), Miramax's two-disc Special Edition of Jackie Brown doesn't feature a commentary by Tarantino, but it features a horde of featurettes and an hour long retrospective interview with the man himself that is worth the price of admission alone.",1119052800,,1797,5.112627986348123
1725036,5,B000068DBD,"Time will prove this movie a masterpiece. ""Jackie Brown"" has pacing, intelligence, laughs, atmosphere, and thrills -- none the least of which are in the utterly honest and often hilarious dialogue -- but mostly it has heart. Quentin Tarantino has created a love story for the 1990s and a song for the ages. Max Cherry and Jackie Brown are easily the hottest middle-aged mismatched couple in movie history, and just as sweet as a child's first crush. I saw the film for the first time last night, and I honestly miss the pair of them already. I intend to buy the DVD so I can savor them and their clever, soulful, poignant adventure, again and again and again.",1119052800,,659,4.593220338983051

Jackson plays a gun-seller with many small-time crooks working for him like Robert DeNiro, Bridget Fonda and Pam Grier. Pam Grier works as a flight attendant on a small airline that flies to Mexico which is where Jackson's money is hidden. Grier gets arrested by an ATF agent  while carrying $50,000 of Jackson's money. Along with her bail bondsman Robert Forster, Grier concocts a plan where she has both the ATF and Jackson believing she is working with them. This is a well written and acted movie. It is also a testament to how well-made it is that while this a long movie and is very slow-paced, I wasn't bored as I usually would be with a film that took its time like this one.",1118620800,,828,4.341935483870968

1725040,5,B000068DBD,"News of Robert Forster's prospective starring role in a new television series based on the Karen Sisco character (see Elmore Leonard's OUT OF SIGHT) got me thinking about the knock-on effect of quality on quality.

JACKIE BROWN  is a film (based on Elmore Leonard's RUM PUNCH) that I come back to time and time again, drawn in the main by the wonderfully understated roles of Robert Forster and Pam Grier. Who are these people, I wonder - uncelebrated, unknown in the main - who made this film such a visually gourmet experience?

Ah, `uncelebrated, unknown', did I say? Check out their credits like I just did: Robert Forster's got 48 films under his belt going back 30 years or so, while Pam Grier's got 61 and counting.

I wouldn't mind betting that, were you to ask their co-stars, Robert de Niro (okay, so he's a similar age bracket: just hear me out for the sake of my argument) and Samuel L Jackson about their key formative influences in theatre and film, they'd point unhesitatingly to troupers like these.",1109635200,,1015,4.685393258426966
1725041,5,B000068DBD,"By the time Quentin Tarentino made ""Jackie Brown"" in 1997, his success as one of Hollywood's premier directors seemed assured. His hyper stylish crime thriller ""Reservoir Dogs"" caught the eye of film fans and Tinseltown big shots back in the early 1990s, and ""Pulp Fiction"" sent his popularity soaring. Certainly, many must have thought, ""Jackie Brown"" would put his career into the stratosphere. Alas, such was not to be. Critics gave this film a cool reception, and fan reaction was equally mixed. Attacks launched against the movie cited its slow pace, the absence of the sort of dialogue that made ""Dogs"" and ""Fiction"" such a joy to watch, and a rather mundane plot as proof that ""Jackie Brown"" ranks as a minor Tarentino effort. Maybe they have a point. I know I have a few problems with it. But I also think this film is a massively entertaining picture well worth watching. In fact, I would rather spend a few hours rewatching ""Jackie Brown"" then spend time viewing the vast majority of films churned out by Hollywood, films that cannot provide even a fraction of the heart and soul found in nearly every scene of this movie. Besides, ""Jackie Brown"" stars Pam Grier, and I love Pam Grier.

Grier plays the titular character, a washed up flight attendant rapidly running out of options in life. She works for Cabo Airlines, one of those fly by night operations that gives jobs to people who can't get a job anywhere else, and she uses her position to engage in several shady money laundering operations run by Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson). Robbie makes his living selling guns to anyone with cash, and Jackie is only one of many people he employs in his dirty dealings. Unfortunately, federal agent Ray Nicolette (Michael Keaton) and his partner are on to his operation. They haul Jackie in after they catch her with a wad of cash in her handbag, hoping that they can convince her to turn state's evidence against her boss. Brown refuses not out of a sense of altruism--Robbie is, after all, a very bad guy capable of murdering anyone he thinks will turn on him--but out of a sense of fear. She knows what this guy is capable of doing, but she also knows that if she loses her job she's out the money she gets from Robbie as well as any chance of obtaining employment at another airline. What's a woman to do when faced with such a conundrum? Easy--hook up with a lonely bail bondsman by the name of Max Cherry (Robert Forster) and come up with a plot to escape from her plight.

Jackie Brown is a very intelligent woman with more cunning than a dozen crime bosses. She formulates a plan that will keep her out of prison, get Ordell Robbie off her back, and allow her to walk away with a half million dollars in cold cash. It's not going to be an easy task. She faces opposition from the reluctant Cherry, from the deeply suspicious Robbie, from Ray Nicolette, as well as danger in the form of Louis Gara (Robert De Niro), an ex-con currently working for Robbie. Throw in Ordell's dippy yet enormously conniving girlfriend Melanie (Bridget Fonda) and you have the makings for a caper with more twists and turns than your lower intestine. Through it all, Jackie Brown navigates her way across obstacles with the tenacity of a woman with nothing left to lose in life, and she looks great doing it. Tarentino treats us to many offbeat scenes that only make sense in a film made by Quentin Tarentino. For instance, Robbie Ordell and Louis Gara spend time sitting around watching a videotape of bikini clad women firing an assortment of weapons while Robbie explains the ins and outs of the arms business. Tarentino also replays the essential part of the scam over and over again, each time showing us the exchange from a different character's perspective. It's good stuff.

When ""Jackie Brown"" works, it works wonders. It's all about Pam Grier, really, and for that I am truly thankful. It is obvious Tarentino has watched all of her low budget exploitation films from the 1970s--one of the songs that plays in the movie is a tune sung by Grier for one of her earliest films, and he hired Grier's longtime screen partner Sid Haig to play a judge. Two important things become obvious when comparing Grier's earlier work with her performance here: she's become a much better actress and she's even more beautiful now. Grier conveys complex emotions with a look, a slight movement, and an inflection of her voice--all things she utterly lacked early in her career. And she manages to pull it off while looking drop dead gorgeous. I couldn't believe how incredible she looked in that pantsuit she puts on at the mall. Grier is so good in the movie that it is easy to overlook the effectiveness of Forster and Jackson. Both men turn in bravura performances, especially Forster as a lonely man who falls in love with Jackie. What doesn't work, in my opinion, is Robert De Niro. It's strange to say, but this acting legend feels out of place in a Tarentino film and mars what is otherwise a great film.

All Tarentino fans will want to pick up this two-disc collector's edition. It's stuffed with so many interesting extras--the Chicks with Guns video we see in the movie is here in all its hilarious glory--that the viewer will stay busy long after the final credits roll. Perhaps the most important aspect of ""Jackie Brown,"" however, is something Tarentino emphasized in previous films, namely that Hollywood's tendency to throw away actors after they move into old age is a big mistake. Here's to hoping Tarentino keeps pulling these guys out of semi-retirement!",1109548800,,5565,4.69293756397134

The movie definitely needs to be seen more than once. The complexity of the story overshadows the deeper shades of the movie when you first watch it.

So if you're a woman - take a closer look at this movie.

I could have given it five stars, but all the drugs, guns and violence left me with a feeling of a cliche environment. Haven't I seen this agent shake this little white-powder-containing plastic bag with exactly that look in his eyes a hundred times already? Naturally, Tarantino was doing an adaptation.

Her second film by Quentin Tarantino, the new Orson Welles, and I say that without sarcasm, is an Elmore Leonard vehicle, a tale of bail bondsmen and shifty grifters; well, Pam is maybe too much woooomannn!  With 1960's Rhythm and Blues pulsating, the score drives a tale of illegal gun dealers and a cool half-million.

Tarantino is all about style.  There's something so satisfying about recognizing the inside jokes.  Ya get, get, hehe? There's almost a comic book exaggeration about Tarantino's work that lends itself in script and film to the big screen.  Is Samuel L. Jackson the coolest looking dude ever?  Probably!  Is Pam Grier the hottest AARP member of all time?  Yeah!  Is the gunplay and indiscriminate sex all comic books?  Yeah.  I wonder how women feel about Quentin's films?  There are so many swaggering dudes having their way.  Hmmm, maybe they'd be wrong about Jackie Brown because the chicks are the brains in this one.

1725047,5,B000068DBD,"For starters this is my favorite film by director Quentin Tarantino.  Ostensibly, it's an adaptation of Elmore Leonard's ""Rum Punch"" but in reality it is a vehicle for one of Tarantino's favorite actresses, Pam Grier.  Much like the ""Kill Bill"" films did for Uma Thurman, Grier shines under the loving direction of Tarantino.  The story, though elaborate, seems superfluous to the acting here and the interaction between these interesting characters.  Grier is just brilliant as the stewardess at middle-age caught between a rock and a hard place with the Feds and the gun runner, Ordell (Samuel L. Jackson).  You can sense that she will be able to manipulate her way out of this sticky situation through guts and common sense.  Jackson has never been better as the charismatic, yet cruel, gun-runner.  Robert Forster as the love-sick bailbondsman, Max, effectively plays a man who helps Jackie more through emotion than his own common sense.  Bridget Fonda as Melanie the slacker beach bunny gives a multi-hued performance to a part that could have been written off as a stereotype.  Robert DeNiro, is sublimely clueless as Louis, Ordell's jailhouse buddy.  Michael Keaton delivers solid work as Ray the Fed.  Tarantino delivers an effective soundtrack of vintage r'n'b.

1725056,5,B000068DBD,"Tarrantino showed his maturity in this film, assembling a very fine cast in a wry transformation of Elmore Leonard's Rum Punch.  Always one to have fun with 70's action films, Tarrantino's masterstroke was resurrecting Pam Grier in the title role.  Grier, who made her career in such blaxploitation movies as Coffy and Foxy Brown, gives a star performance in this film. She is well balanced by Samuel L. Jackson as Ordell, a two-bit drug dealer, and Robert Forster, who turns in a remarkably understated performance as Max Cherry, a bail bondsman.

Tarrantino pretty much followed the 70's action film formula here, letting the movie build slowly and relying heavily on dialog to carry the action. Once again, he has underscored his film with a fine soundtrack, which even includes a track from the Brothers Johnson, Strawberry Letter 23, as Ordell does away with one of his runners.  But those used to Tarrantino's high octane films may be disappointed with this one, but I found it to be a very enjoyable departure from his usual fare.",1092009600,,1037,4.908571428571428

Tarantino is my favorite director because he gives an imaginitive, almost voyeouristic look into the lives of a group of petty criminals and makes us genuinely care about their sucesses and failures in life. I almost feel like I'm eavesdroppig by hidden camera on the characters as they go about their business of living their lives. Tarantino brought back the rugged real gritty film-making that was missing in the yuppie era of the eighties and the glossy, high-action effect cop movies of the nineties. I won't bore you by outlining how every big star in this flick gives an awesome performance, read the other reviews for that...

This is a movie that appreciates with each viewing. The laid back story-telling that may seem boring the first time you see this film; becomes the life of the film once you've seen it a few times. The fact that they're all chasing 1/2 a million dollars becomes incidental once you fall in love with the characters. This movie is for an older generation. If you loved Pulp Fiction when you were young, then you should pick up Jackie Brown in a few more years and it will surely be your next favorite Tarantino movie.",1091491200,,1326,4.690987124463519

I'll warn you that this has a lot of talking but if you listen and start getting to know the character, you'll love this movie so don't expect anything like Kill Bill Volume 1. I love all of Quentin's work and I still do. This is one movie that movie lovers can't survive without. This is his first and only (so far) that he didn't entirely write because this is from Elmore Leonard's ""Rum Punch"", but he wrote it for the screen and changed some of it.

1725060,5,B000068DBD,"Let me first say that 'Jackie Brown' is an incredible film. It has unique, textured characters and features great performances by everyone in the cast (most notably Pam Grier and Robert Forester). When the film was originally released, many displayed satisfaction over this film not being 'Pulp Fiction', which is unfortunate because that is part of what makes this film so good. The brilliance of 'Pulp Fiction' is built on with this effort, not diminished by trying to rehash what Tarantino did before.

 What Tarantino did was take a story that could have been a plot-driven, catchy, cool-looking heist film, and instead made an interesting character film with a heist going on in the background. The movies slow and deliberate pacing was another one of the complaints some had, but go back and watch these opening scenes and the ""slow moments"" of the film after having viewed the film. What one will find are characters literally living on the screen. These ""pointless"" scenes are the frame for the action (the heist); they subtly show us everything we need to know to understand these characters and their motivations. If one can complain about anything in the film, it is that the film is too thorough (and this could be a worthy argument, although I disagree).

 Characters: This is really Quentin's great talent. Sure, there's no question about his knack for writing dialogue, but the dialogue works for two other reasons: 1) the characters are so strong, 2) the acting is so good. His talent really is in making the characters and in the way he tells the story through them. This film could have been driven by the heist plot and been a great film. But what Quentin achieved here, to me, was both refreshing and unexpected. Watching it now, after having viewed the 'Kill Bill's and having seen 'Jackie Brown' a number of times, I can appreciate some of the things I missed when I first watched this film upon its original release in 1997.

 This is definately a film that grows with time. There is so much in these characters that each subsequent viewing is a delight.",1090972800,,2077,4.787709497206704

He is a little dumb, lazy and slow but funnily played.
Key to the movie is Pam Grier as Jackie Brown, the smartest person in the movie because she can play both sides, the feds and the criminals and ends up with a lot of dough.

1725062,5,B000068DBD,"I love Quentin Tarantino. You watch him speak about his art in interviews, and while I realize what I'm responding to might simply be a cleverly-wrought public persona, his energy and enthusiasm for his craft is just so infectious that one cannot help but be energized too. That energy certainly carries over into his movies, and while he may not be the most thrillingly visual director, his undeniable gift for dialogue more than compensates in his films.
PULP FICTION, as of now, is my favorite movie; the dialogue sparkles with wit, and I could hear those lines over and over again without ever getting tired of them. JACKIE BROWN, his follow-up to PF, is just as good as PF, if not quite its superior. Many complained upon its release that this movie was too sluggish and slow-moving (the above Editorial Review calls it ""decaffeinated""). Sure, the plot of this movie certainly could become a taut, exciting thriller under another director's hands. But clearly writer-director Tarantino isn't aiming merely for action-movie thrills. He is also focused on his characters, particularly with the two older characters, Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) and Max Cherry (Robert Forster), two characters who have an unspoken attraction to each other that brings an intriguing undertone to a majority of the crime story. If Tarantino takes his time developing his characters and laying out the plot...well, the characters' dialogue is consistently full of life; the characters are interesting (and the performances terrific across the board, particuarly Forster's); and the convoluted plot, when it kicks into high gear, is a source of fascination as well. Watching it, I hardly ever felt that it was too slow for its own good: I was too fascinated by what I was seeing and hearing to notice any possible deficiencies in pacing. (Another Elmore Leonard adaptation, Steven Soderbergh's OUT OF SIGHT, took a similarly leisurely approach to its crime plot, and it worked just as well in that film, too.)
In short, JACKIE BROWN is an underrated Tarantino masterpiece. It may not be quite the film PULP FICTION is (since it had a more palpably energetic feel to it, despite both films' running 154 minutes), but it is certainly a worthy follow-up.",1087516800,,2229,5.043360433604336
1725063,5,B000068DBD,"Jackie Brown is the third film from Quentein Tarantino. The pop cultre master has made another perfect film, and put simply this guy is the man.
Jackie Brown(Grier) is a flight attendant for the worst air line in the U.S.. She doesn't like her job alot, but it pays her bills and lets her work. Ordell(Jackson) is a guns dealer. He sells guns to whoever will buy them and he's not shy about it. He has $500,000 in Mexico and he's slowly smuggling it into the U.S. with Jackie bringing in some on each of her trips. Ordell has just had one of his old prison buddies Louis(De Niro) get out of jail and the ex-con starts working for him. He meets Ordells' stoned out beach bunny girl friend Melanie(Fonda) who knows a lot about Ordell and about his plans.
After Beaumont(Tucker) gets arrested Ordell goes to bail him out. He uses Max Cherry(Forester) as the bails bondman to get Beaumont out. Ordell gets him out and quickly kills him before to much can be said about their link together. The next day Jackie is arrested outside the airport by ATF officers Ray(Keaton) and Mark(Bowen). They know she has the money on her from the tip from Beaumont and they take her to jail. Ordell bails her out using Cherry again.
Cherry goes to get Jackie out and almost instantly falls in love with her. He offers to help her in any way that he can. Jackie being the smart woman she is knows Ordell wants her dead. After she stops his attempt at it thye cut a deal on how to get his money back into the U.S. where neither will have to go to jail. The plot quickly turns into a race where everybody is involved in getting the $500,000. Who is playing who and who will end up with the money. That's the master tail of Jackie Brown.
This movie has the perfect cast in it. Once again Tarantino puts the perfects cast there and everyone shines. They all hold their own with each other and they all give a memorable performance. Tarantion has written the perfect script and the dialouge in the movie is perfect.
Samuel L. Jackson is the man. I laughed so hard watching his performance. His character Ordell might be my favorite one that he has ever played. You just have to love it.
Robert Forrester gives the most memorable performance of the film. He deserved his Oscar nomination and should have one it. He is the odd ball in the movie. Somebody described him as the guy you know you've seen in a movie, you just can't remember what movie it was. That holds true in this. You just love his performance. You can read the sadness in his eyes in one scene, then see the absolute joy in them in another. He should have one the Oscar and this is one of the best performances I've ever seen in a movie.
The rest of the cast is great. Pam Grier rocks in the lead role as the sassy middle aged black woman. I like Grier a lot and this is her at her best. De Niro's performance isn't quite what you'd expect from him. You can argue him as the greatest living actor, but his character and performance doesn't add to that statement. He isn't bad, it's just not memorable like so many of his other movies.
The DVD specials are great. I loved the Chicks with Guns video. All the specials on the making are great. Tarantino had a blast making it, and the interviews are great with him. There are a ton of extras. This is one of the best DVDs that I've ever viewed.
If you like Tarantino you have to pick this one up. Don't compare it Pulp Fiction or Resvoir Dogs because if you do you won't enjoy it as much. It's a different kind of movie from Tarantino. This is an influential movie, and without it I don't think we'd have some of the crime robbery thrillers that have been popular the last couple of years. Buy this movie and prepare yourself for a great ride.",1087430400,,3730,4.3223965763195435
1725064,2,B000068DBD,"After seeing the brilliant ""Pulp fiction"" I went and had a look at the trailer for ""Jackie Brwon"", it looked good -- but think again. Trailers can sometimes be wrong. It was meant that this would have more action than Pulp fiction, but this didn't have any sort od action what so ever. The cast is quite nice though, Quentin always knows to pick the right people, they played their interesting characters well. The story was quite cool, but it jjust got to complicated. There was lots of dialogue, but it wasn't interesting at all. Un-intersting dialogue=boring. The movie dragged a lot too, it seemed like Quentin was making the film long on purpose. If you're expecting anything like ""Pulp fiction"" then you won't like this. It's nothing like it. I wouldn't buy this, Pulp fiction fans. Probably just Tarantino fans. However, Chris Tucker did shine some light in the movie, but he isn't in it for long.",1086220800,,904,4.727848101265823
1725065,4,B000068DBD,"I am a huge fan of Elmore Leonard, the author of ""Rum Punch,"" the novel on which this movie was based, so naturally, I had high expectations.  I was not disappointed.  Robert Forster is EXCELLENT, deserving of the Oscar nomination.  Samuel L. Jackson once again steals the show, he dominates every scene.  I cannot think of anyone else who could play Ordell Robbie than Jackson.  I read ""Rum Punch"" about a year before the movie came out, and I actually envisioned Jackson as Robbie as I was reading.  And who better to direct this Leonard classic than Tarantino?  Every scene sizzles, the music is PERFECT, the camera angles are brilliant, and the dialogue is a non-stop assault that held me spellbound.  I can't understand why people compare this to ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"" and critisize it so harshly.  If Tarantino put out one movie a year and had 12 or 15 or 20 movies, then I could understand putting it up against ""his best.""  Fortunately, Tarantino only has 4 movies (if you count ""Kill Bill vols. 1 and 2 as one movie.) and all four movies are treasures, each as enjoyable to me as the others.  I don't have a favorite Tarantino movie.  On another note, I'd like to see Tarantiono make another Leonard novel into a movie.  ""Pronto"" is one of my favorites and it would make a spectacular movie, since over half of the story takes place in Italy on the Meditteranean.  I'll keep my fingers crossed.  (let's just hope the next Leonard novel brought to the silver screen is not a disappointment, ""The Big Bounce"" was one of my favorite Leonard books, his first crime novel, but it was recently butchered on screen.  I am aware that ""Be Cool,"" the sequel to ""Get Shorty"" will be out soon and, while ""Be Cool"" is among my least favorite Leonard novels (I have read 26 of them) I am expecting a good movie.",1084752000,,1820,4.553846153846154

1725067,2,B000068DBD,"""Jackie Brown,"" I am sorry to say, is a clunker. Coming three years after ""Pulp Fiction"" (an intolerably long wait for fans of Tarantino), this Pam Grier vehicle simply does not have a compelling enough story to justify its running time. I have absolutely nothing against long movies, but when you can feel the length of a 2.5-hour movie, there is a problem, and such is the case with ""Jackie Brown.""
Tarantino apparently felt the need to prove he could make a ""hang-out"" movie like ""Rio Bravo,"" in which the characters take a long time to recite lots of dialogue and basically sit around doing a whole lot of nothing. Frankly, after the ""Citizen Kane""-like genius on display in ""PF,"" I for one did not need to know that QT could make a hang-out movie.
Here Tarantino is basically directing a made-for-TV movie, utilizing many of the stock filmmaking techniques that he shunned in ""PF."" (Character talks. Cut to the other character. He talks. Cut back to the other character. Close-up. Medium close-up. Two shot.) Tarantino's dialogue is great, and he's one of the best directors who ever lived, but scene after scene in which two people are smoking cigarettes and talking in a rather bland and boring office remind me more of a Movie of the Week than Tarantino.
The story is quite miniscule but is stretched out over a long, long time. This is coupled with the unfortunate fact that Pam Grier -- sorry -- cannot act. She's almost there in some scenes, but time and again she demonstrates a complete inability to carry a movie convincingly. Samuel L. Jackson grates a nerve as Ordell, and Michael Keaton, though enjoyable, is sadly wasted (he has maybe seven total minutes of screen time). Talk about wasted -- Robert De Niro is here in a Tarantino film, and he's the most underused actor in the entire movie.
Robert Forster provides the only saving grace. He's solid as Max Cherry and deserved his Oscar nomination. Too bad the movie wasn't a big enough success to launch his career into the stratosphere where it belongs.
So, ""Jackie Brown"" disappoints. But that's OK. QT resurrected himself with the dazzling ""Kill Bill,"" the epic that makes even ""Pulp Fiction"" look like child's play. No harm, no foul.",1083110400,,2206,4.762402088772846
1725068,4,B000068DBD,"Its about a 44-year old airline hostess Jackie Brown who's followed by the police for transporting money and drugs for Ordell Robbie, a guns and drugs trafficker. Robert Forster is Max Cherry, a bail bondsman who's done business with Ordell twice (once for Beaumont, who worked for Ordell but got killed by Ordell for being unreliable). Ordell has a million dollars stashed away in Mexico (dirty money he made), and relies on Jackie to smuggle it back to him in the US every time she flies. When the police found her out, needless to say, Ordell had no scruples about killing her, unless she came up with a plan around the situation, which she did. Anyway, Jackie's plan was ingenious and she manages to screw up both the police and Ordell and takes all the money for herself in the end, with the help of Max who actually developed a fondness for her. Like many Tarantino movies, there's a bit of love, lots of violence and swearing, and a twist in every plot. This is a good one because the plan Jackie came up with was so clever and so risky. At the end of the movie, I had to watch it again and the clever-ness of it all became even clearer. No doubt it will get the thumbs-up from women everywhere who will say ""Thanks to Jackie Brown, who proved that older women can be attractive and smarter than everyone else..."" or people who say ""Thanks to Jackie Brown, who is yet another example of a black american women that kicked ass"", etc.. Whatever you say about this movie, you have to admit, its really Tarantino's masterpiece. I'm going to watch Kill Bill 2 next!",1082851200,,1567,4.4825174825174825
1725069,4,B000068DBD,"and that's a good thing. I can understand how people expecting a ""Tarantino movie"" were dissapointed with the film. It lacks the excessive over the top violence, pop-culture references, and dark humor that fill his other films. However for those expecting a well scripted (though it does drag in some moments) and well-acted film; this definitely would fit the bill. It contains all the great dialogue of an Elmore Leonard novel, and the greatest ""sounds of the 70's"" music since Reservior Dogs.
The best description I could manage for the movie for this film is ""Out of Sight"" without the excessive gloss. It plays out like any Elmore Leonard movie, but Tarantino's style made it look and feel like it belonged in the same era that gave us ""Foxy Brown"", or ""Dirty Harry."" Speaking of ""Foxy Brown,"" Pam Grier gives what has to be her best performance ever in this film. While Samuel L. Jackson and Robert De Niro continue to show us how why they are great actors; Robert Foster as the wise, but smitten, Max Cherry makes this movie great. If you want a ""Tarantino film"", this isn't for you. However if you want a well-made Elmore Leonard movie, made by a great director who loves the 70's as much as he does making good movies, this is for you.",1082419200,,1244,4.608108108108108
1725070,5,B000068DBD,"This is my favorite Quentin Tarantino movie, and it is the best of all the film versions of an Elmore Leonard novel.
Quickly put, the move and novel are about a stewardess, Jackie Brown, who has been flying in from the Bahamas the illegal profits of Ordell Robbie, who sells guns for a living (by the way, Amazon Reviews got it wrong. Tarantino does not change Ordell's race in the movie. In the book, he is described as a light skinned black man). The Feds want Ordell and they try to use Jackie Brown to get him. Jackie Brown has ideas of her own, though.
Tarantino strikes the exact right tone to capture the smart, realistic writing of Leonard.  And, as is often the case with Tarantino, the film could not have been better cast.  So many great actors got their due in this film, and justly so, primarily the great Pam Grier, playing Jackie Brown. I have always loved Pam Grier (who doesn't?), and she has never, ever been used to better effect. It was also great to see Robert Forester, who turns in a performance so subtle and assured it makes you grieve he doesn't get more work. One of Tarantino's great strengths as a filmmaker is his shrewd casting of under appreciated actors and putting them in perfect roles where they shine. He did it for John Travolta in Pulp Fiction, and he does it again with both forester and Grier.
In lesser roles, but no less interesting, Michael Keaton displayed great control and reserve as a very convincing ATF Agent, and Bridget Fonda was perfect as Melanie, a girl with a lot of attitude and none of it good.  As for Samuel L. Jackson, suffice to say that one of the greatest character actors in film history turns in another gem.
This film came as a surprise to fans, as this film does have a much different pace and style than Tarantino's better-loved films - much less violent and splashy.  But I think the criticisms of the film (too slow, too sluggish) are just flat wrong. As the filmmaker himself has said, he wished to make a film for grown ups.  He certainly has.",1079308800,,2016,4.467391304347826

Why isn't this incredibly charismatic actress working right now?), Sam Jackson (Hey Hollywood when are you going to give this man an Oscar nod?) and a performance from Robert Forster that almost steals the movie?
The problem is not with the actors it's the fact that the film is too long and really needs editing. Just because you film something doesn't mean it needs to get into the final cut. There are numerous sloppy moments that dont' add to the film and just drag the action down. It's a crime thriller, not the epic that Tarantino apparently tried to force it to be.

In fact it is as clear and precise as a flight schedule. But the plot is intricate and so complicated that we have some pleasure in having difficulties to follow it. Three layers of crooks and one layer of cops, altogether four layers of plotting and scheming and trying to trick the others and steal the unclean money from one another and laundry it at the same time. It is impossible to tell such a film without destroying the suspense, though we know that two of these crooked individuals will win, and we know which ones, but we have to go on with the film to find out how they are going to do it, and convince the cops at the same time that they did nothing except maybe helped them, at least convince them enough for them to report them clean to their higher-ups and to report themselves as successful  in bringing their target down, but what is their target ? That was never clear because, and that's probably the only interesting idea in this film, cops are never very clear about their objectives and they improvise most of the time. Entertaining for sure though without the glamour and the power of the past.

1725074,5,B000068DBD,"To the people who complain about the pacing of the movie, or the lack of complexity in the story, they miss the entire point. With Jackie Brown, Tarantino matures both as a director and a writer in his overall mastery of the world he creates. And the performance he brought out of this all-star cast of seemingly misfitted characters should be applauded, and enjoyed forever.
Jackie is an air flight attendant down on her luck. She couriers money from Mexico for gun dealer, Ordell Robie, who is under investigation from two detectives on his case. When Jackie is caught with the money, Max Cherry is the bail bondsman who springs her from prison, and instantly falls in love with her. Fearing for her life, Jackie devises a way she can hand the police Ordell Robie, get Ordell to trust her enough not to kill her, and take him for all his money while getting away scot free.
The story is rather linear and straightforward (rare for Tarantino), and the plot, while being smartly structured, is not complex. It's not hard at all to understand. The pure joy in watching this movie is seeing the little things the actors do in playing their parts. While watching Jackie and Max in the mall in LA, you start to believe that it's a real place. The slum-like neighborhood that Max and Ordell operate in are believable enough to be acceptable, yet puts you on guard as your characters walk through the streets. Jackie and Max's love is sweet and pure, while you see Louis and Bridget Fonda's beach bunny character as hateful and ugly. The movie breaths and thrives all on its own, with no special effects, with no elaborate plot schemes, it is just well made and beautiful.
There's always one scene that sticks out in my mind. Towards the end of the movie, Michael Keaton's character has Pam Grier in the interrogation room. Having just momentarily lost the money and Ordell, Keaton is furious. Yet with Grier's air tight alibi, he can't blame her, he can't blame anyone. And as Grier continues to smoke cigarettes in front of him, you see him nervously pacing, and finally taking out a stick of gum and furiously chewing it in a way only a true smoker knows. It's the way someone who has quit (or is trying to quit) chews gum, to appease their oral fixation. And the moment is so understated, so small, and so quick, you start to wonder was it Tarantino who told him to act in that fashion? Or was it Keaton, operating within this world that Tarantino had created for his actors, to act so natural and REAL, that you start to believe in Jackie....you start to cheer for Max, you start to fear Ordell, and you start to laugh at Louis. This movie gets you involved...
Roger Ebert described this movie as a masterpiece, saying once the credits roll, you wish the characters could just keep interacting forever, it's just that good. And while people point fingers at Tarantino, knocking him for his violent and inappropriate content, claiming he writes movies for the diseased pop culture mind, they obviously have never seen Jackie Brown. It's a movie that only adults would enjoy. There are no cool catchphrases, or gunshot wounds, or controversial sodomy scenes. It's just slow enough, just gentle enough, it eases you into the story and gives you a chance to appreciate cinema for what it is....a world you get lost in for two hours at a time.",1073952000,,3337,4.638513513513513
1725075,5,B000068DBD,"I started getting interested in Tarantino movies a while back when I heard about Jackie Brown. I read the Elmore Leonard novel 'Rum Punch' (the book the movie is based on) upon hearing about the movie. Eventually I got around to renting Jackie Brown and found it to be nothing less than excellent. While the movie isn't hand in hand with the book it does keep the characters and the general plot. Gone is some of the background relationships some of the main players have. None of this actually takes away from the movie and it is still quite enjoyable. One thing about this movie is that it isn't 'Reservoir Dogs', it isn't 'Pulp Fiction', and it most certainly isn't 'Kill Bill Vol. 1'. Going into to this movie and expecting to see formula that made 'Pulp Fiction' might bring the viewer to a disapointment. It's still a great movie even though it isn't until the second half until things really start to get rolling. All the actors are right on key with their roles and they play well off of each other. This is most certainly another Tarantino classic that any Tarantino must see. It shows Quentin's ability to step out a little bit and expand his talents and abilities so he can still kepp things fresh.

""This TEC-9? They advertise it as being the most popular gun in American crime. Can you believe that s***? It actually says that on the little booklet that comes with it. Most Popular Gun in American Crime, like they're proud of that s***!""
From the first lines of dialogue of this immensely entertaining 1997 caper, we are thrust back into the world of Quentin Tarantino. The beauty of Tarantino's writing/directing style is evident in the above quote. The ""chit-chat"" dialogue that most movies would have left on the cutting room floor these days is not only left in JACKIE BROWN, but it is the heart of the movie itself. About ten minutes into the movie, the average popcorn chewing movie-goer would wonder ""why are they still talking?"" After another ten, they probably get what is going on.
You are left under a spell while watching JACKIE BROWN. There are never any clich scenes where plot points are slammed down on the viewer. The plot is told through dialogue and narrative. Just like in the master's previous film, PULP FICTION, you slowly realize that the dialogue will not stop at any point. Whether they're talking about something as say, whether or not getting inside of a trunk to repay a favor is rational, or something more serious like a felony arrest, the viewer is held in complete awe by what is going down on the screen.
Not to say the film is boring. There is murder, action, romance, intrigue just like any other crime caper. However, through this endless stream of conversation, you come to care about the characters. Some of them you despise. This makes the action that transpires about a thousand times more intense then anything that has come from those lame, tired, lobotomized Jerry Bruckheimer action flicks in recent years.
In JACKIE BROWN, Pam Grier plays the title character, a 44-year-old but gorgeous stewardess stuck in a going-nowhere occupation, who helps make ends meet on her meager salary by smuggling in cash for a Hermosa Beach-based arms dealer, Ordell (Samuel L. Jackson, in a fitfully funny performance). One day, while carrying in the cash, the hapless Brown is busted by ATF agent Ray Nicolette (top-notch performance from Michael Keaton), and is thrown into an ATF/DEA deal to trap Ordell mid-way during the smuggling of a half-million dollars... in cash.
The DVD is fully loaded, with an hourlong documentary, funny deleted scenes, the Siskel & Ebert review (two thumbs way up, naturally), and the MTV promotional contest inspired by the flick.

1725077,5,B000068DBD,"Even after watching Tarantino's latest ""Kill Bill"", I still believe ""Jackie Brown"" to be Tarantino's best work. Maybe not as witty as ""Reservoir Dogs"" or as sparkling and innovative as ""Pulp Fiction"", but no doubt a very mature, complete work which is able to touch the issue of life mistakes and old age. Maybe the charm is created due to the  delicious music (which has the viewer - just like Max - falling in love with the ""Delfonics"") or the fast paced tale, moving between all these incredible characters. For me however, the element which ""made"" this movie is Pam Grier - the Jackie Brown herself.
Grier gives us one of the best women heroines to be seen on screen; a beautiful, strong and independent character which Grier seems to give a true substance. This is no hot shot young lady full of herself and confident of her powers. Jackie Brown is motivated by one thing only - not to have to start all over again. ""this"" she tells Max, ""is more scary then Ordell"". The great Samuel Jackson as Ordell is as good as ever (he is good in any role he does but lately I am starting to get tired of seeing him in the army commander type role)  and Robert De Niro plays a role different then those he usually does, but its really Pam Grier and Robert Forester who give this movie its added value and are able, with only a close up look on their experienced, mature (yet beautiful) expressions to give the movie an extra message.",1069372800,,1427,4.442748091603053
1725078,4,B000068DBD,"Tarantino had impossibly high expectations for his follow-up movie to Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown.  He could've repeated the same formula that made Pulp Fiction a huge hit or do something completely different.  Tarantino choose to stick with what made him famous: movies featuring quirky criminals and lots of dialogue.  This situation isn't as bad as one might think it is.  The casting choices are inspired, each of them (especially Pam Grier and Robert Forester) really make the dialogue and scenes sizzle.  The only problem is that the film wears out its welcome well before the credits roll.  While the dialogue is funny, the plot doesn't really go anywhere for much of the movie, resulting in a fun, but ultimately meaningless picture.  This makes the film's conlusion anti-climatic at best.

1725080,4,B000068DBD,"Honestly, this movie doesn't match the brilliance of its predecessor, PULP FICTION. However, this movie is still a Quentin Tarantino flick. Great directors have their own style: their movies may fall into particular rubrics, but they have a unique identity of their own, creating a different blend of movies, confirming rigidly to their specific style. Quentin Tarantino has his own way of directing and conceptualizing his movies, and JACKIE BROWN, has all the sine qua nons of a trademark `Quentin' movie.
To begin with, the combination of American & African-American gangster pair still continues on from its predecessor. Even this pair of gangsters (Robert De Niro and Samuel L Jackson) is as ruthless and unemotional as the pair (Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta) in PULP FICTION, in executing gory killings. The plot is pretty simple: A female flight attendant, working hand-in-glove with an arms dealer tries to trick him and loot him of his own money. Within the execution of the plot, one is bombarded with the quintessential `Tarantino': great `dirty' dialogues, brilliant retro music, (instead of using background scores, Quentin uses songs) detached & controlled butcherly violence, and of course, the bohemian funny nature of the characters.
Though pretty much in the same lines as PULP FICTION, JACKIE BROWN isn't as inane and mindless as its precursor. Far from his 1994 attempt, which is a classic, Quentin's 1997 attempt, though not in the ranks of PULP FICTION, is still a fantastically made `Tarantino' flick.",1061596800,,1530,5.223577235772358
1725081,5,B000068DBD,"""Jackie Brown"" was widely received as a disappointing follow-up to Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction,"" but I think it's actually a better movie, if less obviously so.  It's hard not to be blown away by ""Fiction"" because of it's sheer audacity; ""Jackie Brown"" is a quieter film that shows Tarantino has the potential to become a mature and sophisticated director.
It's somewhat ironic that Tarantino, associated with the young hipster audience, made this film, because at the basic level ""Jackie Brown"" is about getting old.  All of Jackie's motivations spring from the fact that starting over will soon become impossible for her.  That the options available to a a middle-aged, lower income level, black woman in modern America are severely limited.  Tarantino shows an amazing prowess for getting into the head of this woman. His sensitive direction coupled with Pam Grier's top-notch performance combine to make Jackie one of the most compelling and honest female characters to hit the movie screen in recent years.
The rest of the cast is uniformly excellent too.  Robert Forster stands out as bail bondsman Max Cherry, who becomes Jackie's partner in crime, as it were.  Samuel L. Jackson does well with the kind of part he seems born to play, but his character is not as interesting as the others and so makes less of an impression.  Bridget Fonda is a scene stealer as a California beach bunny, and the contrast between her and Pam Grier is used quite effectively.
It's interesting to note that in the book this movie was based on, ""Rum Punch"" by Elmore Leonard, Jackie was white.  Changing the race of the title character to black adds a whole other dimension to the film that the book lacks.  This is one case where the movie greatly improves on its source material.
""Jackie Brown"" will take some commitment on behalf of the viewer.  It's leisurely paced and more reliant on character study than Tarantino's other films, but these aren't detriments.  They merely illustrate that Tarantino has some range as a director, and I hope he continues to explore that range.",1060300800,,2073,4.92816091954023

Jackie Brown is Tarantino's most mature film to date, and this brilliant 2-Disc Special Edition is just great. Lots of cool Special Features, very good Quality and a nice packaging.
The only bad thing is the lack of Audio Commentary but you can get the True Romance 2-Disc SE if you want an audio commentary by QT.

This movie, although it had a substantial amount of strong language, had classy and fun dialogue, full of quotable lines. Quenton Tarantino's twisty adaptation of Rum Punch was fantastic. I own the dvd and the special features are great too. Robert De Niro was very out-of-character, playing the supporting role as a total doped out loser, but he was very fun to watch and he added a lot to the movie. Michael Keaton (as always) brought a lot of humor and life to the movie, and Bridget Fonda has never looked so good. This is certainly not a family values movie, but maybe something that college age friends can enjoy. The R rating reflects that of the typical Tarantino film, which is for pervasive strong language, violence, drug use and a brief non-graphic sexual situation. This was a great movie though, and if for no other reason, see it for Samuel L. Jackson's memorable performance.",1044576000,,1011,4.7175141242937855

Unfortunately, that's the big reason you would have to check the film out.  I wasn't expecting Pulp Fiction/Resoirvoir Dogs style intensity, but Jackie Brown doesn't even compare favorably with 'Get Shorty'. The main problem - TOO TALKY! And all the talk is largely about nothing, as opposed to the richness of the scripts of PF/RD.  The core of the film, that being who's conning who? goes limp pretty quickly.  The actors are all fine, especially Samuel L. Jackson. I swear, he should do a standup comic routine or a one-man theater show, and used the M-Word liberally throughout, because no one does it as fluently as he does. The ending meanwhile, will suprise no one.  A good 30 minutes could have been sliced off of this film and made it a tighter, more cohesive experience.  The extras are all OK, but like I said at the beginning, you'll want this film for Pam Grier and little else.",1043712000,,971,4.622093023255814

Robert Forrester gives one of the most brilliantly understated performances ever seen.  His Max Cherry is so deeply and sadly in love with Jackie Brown, but he doesn't say it once.  It is written all over everything when he is with her, and it's an intellegent and poigniant performance.  Pam Grier proves that age can and does add to sex appeal, and Bridget Fonda has a 'cameo' role that is not to be missed.
Tarantino directed this in a different style than one would expect from him, but he does a great job in letting this one unfold.

People, listen, this is one of those rare gems that is actually too good for most Pulp Fiction groupies to respect, because like Reservoir Dogs, Jackie Brown escapes Tarantino's tight grip on ""cool trophy of the century"" mentality. Jackie Brown is simply brilliant. Like Reservoir Dogs, too good for an Oscar. Too good for most audiences to appreciate, so all I gotta say is props to Quentin for adapting an Elmore Leonard book and pulling it off as if it were the original mona. oh, and one more thing, the music is the key. so Tarantino's drivin' a caddy. 5 stars man.",1040169600,,1095,4.372549019607843

I decided to pick up the 2 disc edition of JACKIE BROWN just to complete my Tarantino DVD collection, and I must say that this film was a joy to rediscover. It's still no PULP FICTION, but now I realize it was never meant to be PF. Tarantino says so himslef on the disc that it wasn't even really made for the same audience as PF! I enjoyed catching little gems in the film that I never noticed the first time around such as the brilliant subtlety of Robert DeNiros's hilarious performance.
Absent from the DVDs plethora of extras is a Tarantino commentary, but we get something just as good: an hour long 1-on-1 interview in which Tarantino not only discusses the film, but the whole atmosphere surrounding the film during it's release, his hopes and dissapointments the film's release brought, and why this project was such a labour of love for him.

1725089,4,B000068DBD,"In what seems to be the least popular of the Taratino's films, Jackie Brown is a star studded romp through the streets of Los Angeles in search of half a million dollars.
Pam Grier is back as an underpaid airline stewardess hired by Ordell Robbie(Jackson)to sneak half a million dollars in cash from Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.  But when an ATF agent and a police officer get involved everyone comes up with some kind of scam on how they're going to get their hands on the dough.
Pam Grier is awesome in the movie but don't expect this to be a sequil to Foxy Brown.  In Jackie Brown, Grier is middle aged and struggling to make ends meet.
The rest of the movie features Taratino's usual comedy and slow pacing.  At some points the movie seems to move along too slow. I can understand some of the Resevior Dogs/Pulp Fiction audience being quite bored with it.
The DVD features a lot of great bonus material including old Pam Grier and Robert Forester movie trailers.  I'm really happy to see that Tarantino decided to include this in the DVD.

1725091,4,B000068DBD,"Jackie Brown finally has made its DVD debut five years after its original release.  The film was greatly anticipated, as it was Quentin Tarantino's follow-up to his groundbreaking Pulp Fiction.  The film was an adaptation of Elmore Leonard's Rum Punch moving the location from Florida to California.  The movie was met with mixed reviews at the time and suffered in comparison with Pulp Fiction.  The film is a good movie with some great performances.  Much like he did with John Travolta, Mr. Tarantino pulled another great acting job from a forgotten 70's icon, Pam Grier.  In the title role, Ms. Grier plays the character with the sass and grit that made her famous in the blaxplotation films she is famous for.  Another B-movie hero Robert Forester gives the performance of his life as a tired bail bondsman who falls for Jackie and helps in her scheme to screw both a gun dealer and the Feds.  Mr. Forester earned a much deserved Academy Award nomination for his role.  The cast is first rate including Samuel L. Jackson as the gun dealer, Robert DeNiro playing somewhat against type as a dimwitted,  associate of Mr. Jackson, Bridget Fonda as Mr. Jackson's pot smoking girlfriend, Michael Keaton as one of the Feds and in a small part, a young Chris Tucker who meets an untimely end at the hands of Mr. Jackson.  As with Pulp Fiction, the dialogue is sharp and Mr. Tarantino's selection of music is dead on combining such 70's r&b gems like Bobby Womack's ""Across 110th Street"" and Bloodstone's ""Natural High"" with Johnny Cash's ""Tennessee Stud"" and the Grass Roots' 60's pop classic ""Midnight Confessions"".  While this movie is not up to the level of Pulp Fiction, not many movies are.  Mr. Tarantino has fun with the film and overall it is a highly enjoyable movie.",1033516800,,1773,4.773770491803279
1725092,5,B000068DBD,"Quentin Tarantino's 1997 caper film hasn't been available in the DVD format until now, to the irritation of fans of the director and his star, blaxploitation poster child Pam Grier. ""Jackie"" strikes it rich the first time out on the Collector's Edition DVD, decked out in handsome images and funkadelic audio. ""I wanted you to salivate,"" Tarantino says of the delay as he introduces the feature.
Tarantino says ""Jackie"" is best enjoyed with multiple viewings that allow you to ""hang out"" with the characters. ""The first time, there's a plot in the way,"" he says, citing ""Rio Bravo"" as a kindred film.
A documentary brings the usual round robins of praise for the director, but the players in particular have some insightful things to say about Tarantino. Bruce Willis calls him a ""modern Charles Dickens."" Uma Thurman says his gift is to put ""everyday minutiae up against hyper-real drama.""
Deleted scenes collected on ""Jackie"" include a fascinating clip in which Grier's character coldly details her plans to scam both cops and crooks. The film would have a much darker tone with the scene in, the director notes.
The stereo-like mix on ""Jackie"" is especially playful, anchored by a crackling Philly soul bottom. Songs can be accessed directly from the main menu. A recent interview with QT tops the extras. You can compare the film to the script on a DVD-ROM feature that works great.
The DVD set has the same set-up as the ""Pulp Fiction"" release. That's a good thing.",1031443200,,1470,4.884
1725093,4,B000068DBD,"It can't be denied.  The strength of Quentin Tarantino lies in his snappy, realistic, and sometimes humorous dialogue.  Jakie Brown, like Pulp Fiction before it, is filled with eccentric characters spouting out every day conversations that are believable and fresh.

The charm of Jackie Brown is Tarantino cutting back on the gratutious violence, which is okay from time to time, but essentially to showcase yourself as a director you have to show some range.  And with Pam Grier and Robert Forster, two actors that haven't shown what they're made of years before this film, giving fine mature performances that again show what Tarantino can do for an actor's career, the director has found that range, and it should be interesting to see where he goes next.

With a soundtrack that's brings a cool, mellow atmosphere to the film, it's easy to sit back and find your groove while watching the film.  In many ways, I find this film superior to Pulp Fiction in that Tarantino takes his time developing the characters and the plot.  Perhaps it's an homage to an age when short attentions spans didn't rule cinema, and it's good to see a guy who helped reign in that ADD movie chic calm down and let a movie breathe before giving the payoff.

Grier and Forster make the movie worth watching alone, but you can't deny the powerful actor that is Samuel L. Jackson.  He's also a throw back to an age where acting was taken serious as an art and not just a way to get your mug on a magazine and a line of fashion clothes named after you. (Although, today, I suppose you can do both and still be considered a fine actor.) You can literally see Jackson create the character in front of your eyes, by using Olivier techniques of cosmetic props. (Notice Jackson physically looks different in every moive he's played in.) Also supporting the moive is a solid, charismastic performance from Michael Keaton, a quiet, every day character that isn't the norm for one Robert Deniro, and Bridget Fonda, an intelligent actress, perfectly filling in the role of the ""surfer chick"", with a tiny bit of Femme Fatale thrown in.

Solid work from Tarantino, a great cast, an adaptation of Rum Punch.  What else can a movie buff ask for.",1031184000,,2210,4.684754521963824

Everything is perfect except for one thing:  In order to stretch the movie to widescreen format, they cropped off the top and bottom of the picture.  I thought the purpose of widescreen was to show the whole movie!  When I put in my old VHS copy, it turns out there is more missing from the top and bottom of the widescreen DVD than there is from the left and right of the normal screen VHS.  So what?  Bridget Fonda's entire butt is missing off the bottom of the screen as she leaves the room after her ""love"" scene with Robert De Niro.  This is a serious flaw!  I hope they someday release a ""Standard Edition"" that shows the entire original frame.

1725095,5,B000068DBD,"It's finally here to own on DVD.  Quentin Tarantino's ""Jackie Brown"" is now available on DVD, and unlike many other DVDs, this one was released the right way.  This meaning that chances are you will not have to rebuy this great film, because all of the bells and whistles are included.
Tarantino has become so popular and so successful in so little time.  He is a gifted director as well as one hell of a writer.  Though the movie is based on Elmore Leonard's ""Rum Punch,"" Tarantino wrote the script as his own.  You know it must be good when even the orignal author was in awe of the movie!
The movie, like ""Pulp Fiction,"" has a pretty complex structure to it.  It doesn't mean that it was hard to understand.  It was very easy to follow.  But, if someone were to ask me what exactly the movie was about, I might pause and be silent for several seconds, being unable to answer in a satifying manner.  So, I will refrain from doing so.  Just keep this in mind: If you liked ""Reservoir Dogs"" or ""Pulp Fiction,"" chances are that you will enjoy this movie as well.
This movie has one hell of a cast; including Samuel L. Jackson, Pam Grier, Robert Forster, Michael Keaton, Robert De Niro, and Bridget Fonda.  Jackson really steals the spotlight, once again being able to say Tarentino's dialogue so natural that it all flows beautifuly.  Robert De Niro is also awesome, being very subtle and low-keyed.  Pam is terrific, of course.  But you know what, there is not one person that did not do his or her part justice.
And now, for the DVD:
Picture and sound is very top-notch.  It is DTS, so you can play it in that if your system can play it.  Unlike ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservoir Dogs,"" this movie is very colorful.
The extras are there, and there are plenty of them; including trailers, an interview, a documentary, deleted scenes, Siskel & Ebert's review of the movie, and much, much more.  One of my favorite features is the ""Chicks with Guns"" video, shown in its complete form.
I was very pleased with the DVD, and I forgot how great this movie was.  Although I still consider ""Pulp Fiction"" to be Tarantino's best film, ""Jackie Brown"" is a triumph and a breathtaking movie.  Some may call it long, but if you are a fan of Tarantino, the time flies by like you wouldn't believe.  You won't want the movie to end.",1030147200,,2313,4.448931116389549
1725096,5,B000068DBD,"It's a shame to prominently feature such a negative and dismissive review of 'Jackie Brown' because it really is Quentin Tarrantino's finest hour. This film is not Quentin's take on Blaxploitation films, as so many movie critics seem to assume. This is a very soulful movie about survival in all of it's forms. Most of the characters in this movie are just trying to get by, to cling to what they have because it's all they know. This probably resonates a bit more for those of us who are a little more mature, or have ever felt trapped by the circumstances of our own lives. Bottom line though, this movie holds up because it is a well told, thoroughly engrossing, incredibly well acted story. Robert Deniro is hilarious, Sam Jackson is evil incarnate, and Robert Forster and Pam Grier are positively luminous. Don't let that review discourage you.

1725108,5,B000068DBD,"Quentin Taranturo has done pretty well for a boy from Tennessee. His cult status began in 1992 with ""Reservoir Dogs."" In 1994 ""Pulp Fiction"" was a monster hit critically and commercially. Crime is his forte. He also wrote the screenplays for ""True Romance"" and ""Natural Born Killers"". He was an uncredited writer on ""Crimson Tide"" and ""The Rock"".
The combined cost of ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Jackie Brown"" was [money]. Together, they did [money] at the boxoffice. ""Pulp Fiction"" brought in the vast majority of that income, which indicates that ""Jackie Brown"" displeased many fans. My personal opinion is that a lot of those people didn't get all the blood and guts they were expecting.
I can't say which film is better. I do know that ""Jackie Brown"" is a more mature and sensitive work. It might be a nightmare for short attention spanners, as it's deceptively complex. The fact that Elsmore Leonard, who wrote the book the script is based on, was one of the film's producers may have had a positive effect on Taranturo. In any case, ""Jackie Brown"" is a splendid work.
As the opening credits roll, we see Pam Grier, who plays Jackie Brown, in profile. While she is actually riding a 'people moving' walkway in Los Angeles International Airport, she looks like some Egyptian goddess majestically floating down the Nile. This image of her is in startling contrast to the tacky tile mosaics in the background. This simple opening technique cues us to the fact that this is not an ordinary motion picture.
Ms. Grier plays Jackie Brown with a grace and a dignity which is rarely seen on the screen these days. Just like her character, Grier is a true survivor. From her first role in the trashy ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls"" to the dreadful years of so called 'blaxploitation films', she has held on. The result has been an ever increasing number of good roles. In her personal life, she has weathered cancer, as well as the death of a sister from the same disease and the suicide of her nephew. This is a woman who knows much about living.
There is no grace or dignity to Samuel L. Jackson's performance as Ordell Robbi. There isn't supposed to be any, for he is the villain. He certainly gave me the creeps. Jackson has not suffered as much exploitation as his costar because he was fortunate enough to act in several movies directed by Spike Lee.
While he plays the bad guy most of the time, anyone who saw ""Eve's Bayou"", which he both starred in and produced, knows he's a man of rare intelligence and insight. Sometimes I think he made that film in response to his playing both the hero and victim in the hideously misguided ""A Time to Kill"".
Jackson also has a sense of humor. When a reporter asked him to describe his role in the upcoming fourth installment of ""Star Wars,"" he replied, ""He's black.""
Finally there is Robert Forster as Max Cherry. While nominated for an Oscar for this role, he has been stuck for years in mediocre movies and TV shows, he is finally getting choice roles. Ironically, though, he stars in two remakes of Alfred Hitchcock films that will be released two weeks apart this winter. Good luck, Robert!
Bridget Fonda, Michael Keaton, Robert De Niro and Michael Bowen are all excellent in supporting roles. Of interest is the fact that Fonda's and Keaton's characters are the exact opposites of Grier's and Jackson's respectively.
So, what is ""Jackie Brown"" all about? Well, Jackson has a half million dollars he obtained through illegal means, and at least two - and maybe six - characters would like to have it. That's the plot. Just don't forget I said this movie is deceptively complex. I will give you one hint: Never take your eyes off Jackie Brown.
No one composed a musical score for this picture. Instead, many Golden Oldies were used. In most cases, this technique has been used to sell soundtrack compact disks. While I am sure ""Jackie Brown"" sold a lot of CDs, the songs were specifically chosen to propel the plot along. This device works very well.
If anyone would like to read the renowned Elsmore Leonard's book the film is based on, it's title is ""Rum Punch"".",1017273600,,4102,4.667127071823204

Before the manager could answer me some guy who worked there popped up and said they were re-releasing it in May. He said the were adding a ton of deleted footage and that the DVD was definitely being produced on DVD! (He also said it was going to be a 2-Disc Criterion Collection, whether thats true or not, only time will tell).",1013817600,,468,4.329545454545454
1725110,5,B000068DBD,"I waited a long time to see ""Jackie Brown"", because I heard it wasn't any good, and I didn't want to tarnish the memory of ""Reservoir Dogs"" or ""Pulp Fiction"".  Both those films were kinetic, profane, daring, and truly visceral experiences.  I loved every minute of them.  ""Jackie Brown"" is a horse of a different colour, however.  It is low-key, thoughtful, tender, and assured.  And, I must say, just as good.
One of the main criticisms leveled against it, that I've heard, is that it's too long and too slow.  Well, compared to ""Pulp Fiction"", which is about the same length, of course you'd think it was too slow.  But that's the way this story needs to be told, for one simple reason.  ""Pulp Fiction"" was about young, experienced criminals, always on the go, always in control.  They could afford to move quickly.  ""Jackie Brown""s criminals are a touch older.  Jackie Brown and Bail Bondsman Max Cherry even have a conversation about what it means for men to get older (they lose their hair) verses what it means for women to get holder (their behinds get bigger).  It's actually kind of a touching, and very odd, moment to have in the middle of what should be a zippy little heist flick.
Another way it differs from ""Pulp"" or ""Dogs"" (which would lead people to believe that it's sluggish) is the lack of gunplay.  Tarantino's earlier films were defined by the style and abundance of their shootouts.  ""Jackie Brown"" has only six gunshots.  And all are essentially off-camera, or off in the distance, producing little or no blood.  Now I'm not offended by violence in movies.  Not at all.  But it is kind of refreshing to see a director, especially one who's made his name off it, not rely on the showy exploitation of shooting someone.  When he does show it, however, the torment and suffering and guilt of the shooter is always apparent.
Which brings me to the most intriguing thing about this movie.  Tarantino, who the rap on in recent years has been that he's tormented by his early success and hasn't the confidence to make his next picture, actually shows a very assured hand in making this movie.  Besides the above conversation between two aging characters, there are other places where he shows supreme confidence in his decisions.  For instance, he's cast Robert DeNiro in his movie.  Okay, a no-brainer, right?  Wrong.  Because he's cast DeNiro in a tiny, stoical role.  Simultaneously, he's cast Robert Forster (I know he got an Oscar nod, but before that wasn't everyone asking ""Robert who?"") in a role that's very meaty, the tortured love-interest.  A less-assured director would have switched the two actors, but Tarantino knows what he wants, and boy does he get it.  DeNiro doesn't do more than he has to in creating his understated character.  And Forster steals the show with his laid-back, relaxed, but always conflicted Bail Bondsman.
And Forster's scenes with Jackie Brown are touching, chemistry-filled, and a joy to watch.  Credit in this case should go to Pam Grier, as Jackie Brown, another Tarantino casting coup.  Grier is asked to be maturely sexy, street-smart, tough, and vulnerable all at once.  And she pulls it off without flaw.  I suspect that Tarantino has fantasized most of his life about casting Pam Grier in a movie, and would have done so even if the role didn't suit her so.  But it does.  It truly does.  She carries the picture as not only the title character but also its emotional centre.
The rest of the cast is good in their own rights.  Sam Jackson was born to speak Tarantino's dialogue, and doesn't disappoint.  He makes Ordell a genuine badass, even through his ponytail and silly little beard (and Jackson, bless his heart, even throws in a nod to my home town basketball team, the Toronto Raptors).  Bridget Fonda is actually quite sexy as a layabout surfer chick, whose big mouth is bound to get her into trouble.  And Michael Keaton, who I've always thought of as a very underrated and interesting actor, plays his ATF agent with just enough faux-cool and indifference that you're always wondering if he's playing Jackie or if Jackie's playing him.
While talking about character, I'd like to give kudos to Quentin for a neat little-shorthand trick he uses to define them.  Each character essentially has his/her own soundtrack.  A scene near the end, which cuts between several different characters driving in their cars, shows this very well.  Cut from Melanie's (Bridget Fonda) van, where faux-eighties punk is blaring, to Max Cherry's (Robert Forster) car, which features the laid back grooves of the Delfonics, to other characters and their distinctive musical tastes.  The music shifts so suddenly sometimes that it can be jarring, but it's an effective technique.  Furthermore on the music front, Tarantino liberally uses the Meters' ""Cissy Strut"" near the beginning of the film, which quickly brought a smile to my face, and let me know that funky good times were ahead.
""Jackie Brown"" is a fine addition to Tarantino's oeuvre.  Sure, his fingerprints are all over it in some cases, such as his distinctive use of language, and his fondness for shifting time back and forth upon itself to show the same scene from several different perspectives.  But it's much more of a grown up movie.  True, it's a tad too long.  But just a tad.  I can take excessive verbosity from Tarantino easier than I can from any other writer/director, because he's always fascinating, always moving, always trying to surprise, and always trying to tell a good story.  ""Jackie Brown"" succeeds on all counts.",1007942400,,5551,4.833510074231177
1725111,5,B000068DBD,"This was one of the best movies I have ever seen. The acting by Pam Grier, Robert DeNiro, and especially Samuel Jackson was supurb. I can't wait for this movie to come out on Dvd.",1006732800,,179,4.142857142857143
1725112,5,B000068DBD,"Amazingly enough Quentin Tarantino's (Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction) stupendously enigmatic Jackie Brown constantly mesmerizes, habitually amuses, and solitarily overwhelms its audience with Tarantino's sheer focused manipulation of the aesthetic, dramatic, and artistic. Starring Pam Greer (Jackie Brown) in a career defining moment (akin to John Travolta's revival role in Pulp Fiction) along with an all-star cast including Robert De Niro, Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Keaton, Robert Forster, Bridget Fonda, Michael Bowen, and Chris Tucker. The film's bristles with outstandingly versatile performances, intensely creative plays on Tarantino's patented formula, and a newfound narrative looseness not quite found in his previous work. Again it appears Tarantino can do no wrong as he cinematically adapts Elmore Leonard's Rum Punch for the screen.
Containing all the trademark Tarantino pop-culture references, sardonically catchy dialogue, blatantly shocking imagery, terrifically dynamite performances, and an chronologically disrupted narrative, Jackie Brown follows the tale of a down and out airline stewardess who inexplicitly finds herself involved in Ordell Robbie's (Samuel L. Jackson, again in fine form) criminal gun-running enterprise and ATF agent Ray Nicolette's (Michael Keaton also in great form) law enforcement operation. Caught in between possible incarceration on one side and assassination on the other, Jackie concocts a devious ploy upon criminal greed and law enforcement single-mindedness by working both fronts hopefully unearthing a way to get herself out this mess without alarming either side.
Pam Grier, having her first leading role in years, radiantly shines as the quirky fiendishly no-nonsense middle-aged broad mastermind willing to do almost anything to stop herself from starting over. Jackie may no longer be a spring chicken or startling beauty but she still has the mental scruples necessary to stay alive, and Greer articulates this massively sympathetic character at the jugular of the audience's sensibilities. Greer's Jackie Brown is a liberated woman in a keenly realized modern setting who questionably tries to the traverse the Tarantino-brick road of unpredictability with hilariously provocative results.
Lavishly laced with a host of remarkably enduring criminal personalities including Jackson's passably intelligent criminally deprecating Small Arms dealer, De Niro's recently released seemingly happy-go-lucky ex-con who appears to have
misplaced a lot more than years from his life at prison, Bridget Fonda's ditsy pot-chugging rent-a-broad who's more intelligent and self-serving than those around her realize, and Chris Tucker's exceedingly self-centered chatterbox in a jam of his own creation, Jackie Brown abruptly and consistently unshackles it's bewildering stock of neurotically inspired characters on a dramatic rampage that ceaselessly astounds me with it's casts acting chomps and inventive flexibility.
Towering with imposingly notable roles by almost every character, an immediately decipherable artistic narrative tenderness, and a suitably fitting thematically cohesiveness without all of his previous bombast, Jackie Brown represents a new mature level of filmmaking for Tarantino as he continues to let lose creativity on all facets and impress the masses with this deceptively simple crime tale that eludes to a lot more impressive talent and an ever growing intellect than one might have initially thought. Yet in the end, Jackie Brown will stand out as another phenomenal Tarantino character canvas of modern America that is more enthralling on every visceral level than a movie should be without coping out in the least.

1725115,4,B000068DBD,"Based on Elmore Leonards novel ""Rum Punch"", Quentin Tarantino's cool and classy adaptation is considered by many (in Europe, at least) to be his most mature (agree) and perhaps finest work (probably disagree). However, whilst Jackie Brown may not have the instant impact of Reservoir Dogs or the wide appeal of Pulp Fiction it is still his coolest, most subtle and intelligent movie to date. This movie and Tarantino suffered in the wake of expectation  following the critical and popular success of Pulp Fiction, with too many people expecting a retread or at least a faster paced movie. Sadly perhaps due to the dissapointing reception this received, Tarantino has not made another movie since this was made about five years ago but I have to say I loved every minute of it and Tarantino's work is very sadly missed.
However, this movie (or at least the European DVD) is not as advertised by Warner Brothers. It's not an action thriller. It's much more of a slow-burn thriller, starring Pam Grier (as sexy stewardess Jackie Brown), a smuggler caught in the act by an ambitious cop (Michael Keaton), whilst working for gun-runner Ordell (played by Samuel L.Jackson). Add into the melting pot, Jackson's partner in crime ex-con Louis (Robert De Niro in a very understated performance) and other supporting turns by both Bridget Fonda as Ordell's perpetually stoned out bitchin' beach bunny girlfriend and Chris Rock in an impressive straight role and you have a very impressive ensemble cast. And whilst Michael Keaton provides great entertainment as Ray Nicollette, in a role he later reprised in Out Of Sight, the show is stolen by Pam Grier and in particular (the Oscar nominated) Robert Forster as a lonely battle worn bail bondsman, Max Cherry, who falls for the glamarous but ageing Jackie Brown. I hate reviews that tell you the whole plot, so suffice to say that this is a thriller where most of the principal characters are double dealing and double crossing each other to get their hands on Ordell's money and the rest as they say is in the telling. I certainly don't want to spoil this for anyone who hasn't already seen it (and it's certainly worth watching more than once)!
It's clever, it has wonderful dialogue, an excellent cast, understated black comedy, a typically different, typically classy Tarantino style soundtrack and a great story. It just oozes class. I bought this on DVD in the UK and am pretty surprised that it doesn't seem to be available (at the moment) in this format in the US.

1725116,4,B000068DBD,"I really enjoy this movie. I've seen it over and over. I think that what I liked most about it was the fact that the lead character, Jackie, decides to take a chance when push comes to shove. She recognizes that even though she's somewhat at the mercy of some very powerful men, including gun dealer Ordell and ATF agent Ray, she's smart enough to realize that they're both cocky and overly confident, and she can use this weakness to not only break away from both their control, but she can play them against each other and also get the money. She even plays Max Cherry a little, using his infatuation with her to her own advantage.
There is one scene where Jackie, knowing Ordell is coming to her home after she's bailed out of jail, has a gun hidden and ready. She could have ended up a victim like Beaumont, but she knows Ordell for what he really is and not only gets out of the jam she's in, but actually gets HIM to work for HER in her scheme.
There is also another very telling scene where Jackie comes home late one night and has a message on her answering machine from Max and he gives her something like 3 different phone numbers, and you can just sense the weariness in Jackie.

1725117,4,B000068DBD,"Jackie Brown: rated R, 2 hours and 40 minutes
 Jackie Brown is an incredibly well played movie about guns, drugs, and money. Half a million in cash is up for grabs, and the only way to obtain it is by figuring out who is playing whom.
 When Jackie (a stunning Pam Grier) is caught at an airport carrying a veritably large sum of money and a bag of crack, the outline of the story is formed. Jackie is held in custody facing possible time in prison, when the deceptive Ordell, played by black talking Samuel L. Jackson steps into the picture. Ordell hires an honest bailbondsman, Max Cherry, to release Ms. Brown. While Ordell takes care of business, we see behind-the-scenes conversations between the spaced out Robert De Niro, as Lewis, and the dim-witted Bridget Fonda, as Melanie, two of Ordell's main connections. Jackie becomes caught between two sides, both with equal objectives. Ray (Michael Keaton), the cop that apprehended Jackie earlier is after small time arms dealer, Ordell, and Ordell is pulling Jackie into his scheme of acquiring the cash. Meanwhile, Lewis and Melanie have their own plans of taking the money. Jackie can't afford to get into any more legal trouble, and if she doesn't cooperate with the man she owes her freedom to, she will be killed, which sets the stage for the perfect swindle.
 Quentin Tarantino, creator of Jackie Brown, is master of `film noir', and adds an interesting perspective to one scene in particular. Jackie is forced by the feds to frame Ordell, and according to Ordell, she is supposed to double-cross them. Caught in the middle, Jackie must fake an exchange of marked bills, in order to seem loyal to both. The switch is shown through three different viewpoints, adding greatly to the effect. The first time, Jackie is shown leaving the bag of money in a dressing room. Next, Lewis and Melanie are shown actually making the exchange, with the real bag of money left behind in the dressing room, and a suspicious Max Cherry watching. Lastly, Max Cherry watches as Lewis and Melanie swap bags, and the actual bag of cash left for him to pick up. By doing this, the big picture is seen through bits and pieces. Tarantino deserves much credit for its ingenious execution, and Jackie Brown in its entirety is recognized as a success, with phenomenal acting by the whole cast, primarily Pam Grier.",1001116800,,2346,4.773399014778325
1725118,4,B000068DBD,"I was underwhelmed by Reservoir Dogs, I thought Pulp Fiction one of the funniest movies I had ever seen, and now Jackie Brown makes me realize that Tarantino may be the only contemporary commercially successful American director who can be compared to the 70s boy geniuses, Altman, Coppola, and Scorsese.  The reason, after watching Jackie Brown, is obvious: he is an actor's director  and can write the dialogue they need.  These performances, with one very disappointing exception that I'll come to, offer ingenious rythym and detail and, most impressively, blend superbly, like a first rate musical ensemble.  Their styles match into a whole greater than the parts.  Clearly, it isn't just that Tarantino can write the dialogue--it's that he knows how to direct it, how to conduct it.  Samuel L. Jackson's bravura arias of show-off profanity are as specific and joyous as Fischer-Dieskau singing Schubert.  And yes, Robert Forster and Pam Grier are both communicating here at a level of creativity for which I can find no parallel in contemporary American movies.  Even Michael Keaton, an actor whose work has not really impressed me very much, is interesting here. Tarantino seems to keep a lid on him and instead of his usual excess and self-consciousness, he gives off a sense of depth.  We wonder what his character is thinking, who is he, where he comes from.  And Keaton's face has grown more interesting too--the wrinkled jaw, the slightly bulging eyes give him a sort of Nicholson craziness, though with more brains.  A nice surprise.
DeNiro, however, is lousy.  What happened?  The performance is sluggish and crude.  Watching him so inert amidst all these beautifully modulated perfomances made me think of Eli Wallach in The Misfits surrounded by the nervous and newer rythyms of Clift and Monroe.  DeNiro, whose performances had such energy and definition back in the 70's and early 80's seems like a dinosaur here.  (Is it my imagination or is the trouble only when he tries to play characters that aren't very bright?  He can't do dumb without  making it really boring too-- a serious limitation given the roles he takes.)

Sadly, it did not receive all the hype and promotion as did the his previous work, Pulp Fiction, but like many things, that has little bearing on the greatness of the film. In a smart, savvy, sexy performance, Pam Grier smolders with brains and wit as the title character trying to get her life back on track. With great support from Robert DeNiro (looking very disgustingly dirty and dirtbag-ish), and absolutely amazing Robert Forster (a bail bondsman with a heart), Samuel L.

Blaxpoitation Icon Pam Grier and the Modern King of Cool Samuel L Jackson star in this Crime Caper about Trust and Betrayal in the Criminal World.

De Niro and Forster Underplay their roles Wonderfully, letting Jackson and Grier share the Spotlight. Keaton and Tucker make the most of their small but Affective roles. Fonda is also Great, but she can tend to annoy, and try to Snatch the Spotlight.

From the start, Jackie Brown has a ""70's cop flick"" style and furthers Tarantino's objectives of not sticking with main stream cinema.
Another excellent casting job. Pam Grier proves that her sex appeal hasn't gone anywhere. Robert DeNiro is cast in a role that seems to be written for him. (Watch for the ""Lil'Bit"" remark.) One of the best actors in show business today, Samuel L. Jackson returns in a Tarantino project. Interesting and effective casting with Michael Keaton and Bridget Fonda. Almost impressive as Grier's role was Robert Forster's acting job as the bail bondsman.
Once again, Tarantino makes a movie that disturbs as much as it entertains you. The dialogue between Jackson and DeNiro about movies that made low-level hustlers desire certain weapons is disturbing but true in a world that places Hollywood glamour above common sense.

1725126,5,B000068DBD,"Forget the negative comments critics and other hard-boiled viewers say about Jackie Brown. You shouldn't compare Jackie Brown to Pulp Fiction because they are two totally different concepts. Sure, Tarantino could have made this movie into another Pulp, but that wasn't supposed to be the point of this movie.
Jackie Brown proves that Tarantino knows more about filmmaking than only his trademark style. It proves that he can take an Elmore Leonard novel, give it the old 70's funk feel, and at the same time justify the characters. Jackie Brown is a character-driven story, not a plot-driven one, and it is more linear than Tarantino's previous films. It starts out revealing the characters and the worlds they live in: Ordell (Jackson) is a streetwise gun dealer, Louis Gara (De Niro) is a low IQed ex-con, Melanie (Bridget Fonda) is one of Ordell's girlfriends whose ambition is to get high all the time, Max Cherry (Forster) is a tired bail bondsman, Ray Nicolette (Keaton) is a sincere fed, and most of all there is Jackie Brown (Grier), the desperate flight attendant who outsmarts everyone till the end.
The story is unpredictable at the start, then the movie goes through a number of events until all characters end up going afer a half million dollars in cash. Everyone is confident of their plans for the money, but Jackie, with the help of Max, gets the best of them and plays out everyone with her plan.
Tarantino made sure that scenes played out well, and they did. The opening scenes where Ordell plans Beaumont's death were funny, and the money exchange sequences were filmed great. Many people I know complained about the movie's long length, but the reason why it was long was because it showed the plot from ALL the character's perspectives, not just the heroine Jackie, and you have to respect that. It's a movie of how 6 characters live, breathe, and scam, and if they were to run into something as important as a half million dollars, who will be the smartest to get the big score? Jackie Brown is a new beginning for QT, and so what if Pulp Fiction will never be duplicated? We can always enjoy great films from Tarantino.",970876800,,2143,4.7479892761394105

I am sure that many QT fans will complain that it isn't as  good as Pulp Fiction.  That is kind of a silly attitude.  It is a great  movie of its own accord.  The acting in this movie is superb.  Nobody  executes Tarantino dialogue quite like Samuel L Jackson.  Jackson is the  most underrated actor in Hollywood.  Why hasn't this man garnered an oscar  or two by now?  But let let me not digress.  This is another brilliant  performance.  I don't care what Spike Lee has to say about it.  Pam Grier  still electrifies the screen.  DeNiro and Michael Keaton and Bridget Fonda  all turn in sensational performances.  Tarantino does seem to have a skill  at drawing out top notch performances from his cast.  Quentin Tarantino has  produced another winner.  Each time I see a movie I am left waiting for the  next one.  This video (along with all his others will have to ease my  appetite until his next project comes out.,964051200,,1082,4.455958549222798

Viewing this film over and over is like getting into a nice, hot bathtub.  It simmers on the low boil, taking its time, building momentum and taking us on a very entertaining tour of LA  lowlifestyle. Fonda, Keaton, Tucker and especially De Niro are wonderful  acting dumb. Such a treat to see actors let loose to play to the camera  with style, slyness and breathing room. I imagine that any actor who  considers himself an artist would be tickled to work with QT.
Forget  about Mr. Jackson and Mr. Forster and Ms. Grier;  they make it look easy.  This movie is for the ages. Looking forward to QT's next, and next, and  next.  Movies are in good hands with him.",962064000,,697,4.4603174603174605

Her buns disappear in the  widescreen version but are fully visible in the fullscreen version. I took  both these ""widescreen"" items back to the point of purchase,  demonstrated the difference and was promptly granted a refund.

1725132,2,B000068DBD,"I read with great interest the 4 and 5 stars reviews.  I liked Tarantino's first 2 movies but would have been terribly disappointed if he had made something close.  So I give some kudos to him for trying something new.  What is similar is his desire to tell a story through dialogue and  circumstances.  What I didn't feel were the accolades others have bestowed  - interesting story, strong characters, etc.  I feel like I should go back  and watch this again just to make sure I'm not losing my mind.  Quite  honestly I was bored.  None of the characters seemed interesting and I had  no emotional attachment to any of them.  The story seemed to plod.  The 2  stars are really for the acting which is well done.  But you can't act  yourself out of bad writing and direction.  Maybe I'll go back and rent  this.  Surely I'm missing something?",959990400,,843,4.493333333333333
1725133,5,B000068DBD,"It is wonderful to think that the lesser stars of the film Jackie Brown, Pam Grier and Robert Forster, emerge as the dazzling talent and that the major stars, Robert DeNiro, Samuel Jackson, Michael Keaton, and Bridget  Fonda, are left to make the very best of their minor roles. Fortunately,  all of the players, and they are all the best, have successfully combined  their efforts to make Jackie Brown one of the greatest films of the  Nineties.
The night that Jackie Brown, played by Pam Grier, is escorted  released on bail from the Los Angeles County Jail by bondsman Max Cherry,  played by Robert Forster, is the night she is down and almost out. As Max  watches Jackie come into view he is spellbound by a woman who is proving  that you may meet Prince Charming but you probably won't be dressed for the  occasion. At this point in the film, even though all evidence points to the  contrary, Jackie's luck has just taken a turn for the best instead of the  usual worst. Perhaps this is due to the fact that Max Cherry is one of the  few true gentlemen that Jackie Brown has ever encountered in her unenviable  forty-four years on earth.
Max Cherry has just met Jackie's would-be  nemesis, Ordell Robie played by Samuel Jackson, on two bail applications,  one for his ill-fated gunrunner, and one for the doomed Jackie Brown.  Jackie has been shuttling Ordell's money back and forth to Mexico while  working for a small Mexican airline as a stewardess. It does not take Max  Cherry long to figure out that Ordell is a formidable enemy and that Jackie  is smart enough but may not be lucky enough to get out of his clutches  alive.
Max is instantly attracted to the lovely and charming Jackie Brown  while maintaining a wise detachment from the brilliant and audacious scheme  she concocts to turn her misfortune into a small fortune while helping the  police to put Ordell away in prison permanently. Max is the right blend of  decency and analytical intelligence to appeal to Jackie's street-wise  genius.
The plot of this film is intricate, intriguing from the first  second, and best experienced as it unfolds on the screen. Despite the  eternal foul-mouthed witty patois of Ordell, the script is beautifully  written and provides the basis of the flawless characterizations by each  actor. Robert DeNiro is brilliant as Ordell's newly-released mumbling  jailbird buddy, a man who is patently not destined for any form of re-entry  into mainstream life. In fact, one has to look twice to make sure that it  is Robert DeNiro. Bridget Fonda shines in her small role as Melanie, one of  Ordell's stable of unambitious kept women.
The pace of Jackie Brown  follows the story in perfect cadence. This is not a cheap action movie with  a load of noisy stunts and fireworks. Unlike Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown is  not a beguiling throw-away flick that you see once with no great reason to  see it again.
Jackie Brown is the tale of love and luck. Where luck  triumphs over evil and love is born when the bad breaks are tired and  finally at an end.",959040000,,3048,4.689981096408317
1725134,4,B000068DBD,"Quentin Tarantino has directed three films now - the low-budget, violent ""Resevoir Dogs"", the seminal, highly acclaimed and influential ""Pulp Fiction"", and ""Jackie Brown"".  Prior to  ""Jackie Brown"", it seemed that Tarantino was either lionized as  the next Martin Scorsese or thought of as the current flavor-of-the-month.  ""Jackie Brown"" dispels the later notion, I think, adding another  notch to the director's belt of cool flicks.
Blaxploitation queen Pam  Grier stars as Jackie, a 44-year-old flight attendant working for  bottom-of-the-rung Cabo Air.  A long-haired and goateed Samuel L. Jackson  plays Ordell Robbie, an illegal gun dealer with a half-million sitting in  lock boxes in Mexico.  Ordell's afraid to try and pick up the money himself  so Jackie (who needs extra cash) does delivery runs for him.  But she's  nabbed early on by an ATF agent, played by Michael Keaton.  Worried she'll  talk, Ordell gets bail bondsman Max Cherry (Robert Forster) to post her  bail.  And it's Max who ends up driving her home from prison - a nice  relationship soon forms.
I really liked the scene where Max shows up on  her doorstep the next morning and the two have coffee.  She plays a  Delfonics record and a few scenes later you smile when Max actually buys a  Delfonics tape (the other key music is the carefully considered  ""Across 100th Street"", which opens and closes the film).  Also in  the cast is Robert De Niro, who plays an ex-prison buddy of Ordell's.  And  Bridgett Fonda is a perpetually stoned beach bunny - look quick and you  might notice she's watching ""Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry"" on TV  (Fonda's real-life father, Peter starred in that one from the 70's).
I  won't give away any of the plot, because there's some fun surprises, even  if the film runs a little on the long side.  It'll be interesting to see if  ""Jackie Brown"" can do for Pam Grier's career what ""Pulp  Fiction"" did for Travolta's.  This one's rated R, so be warned - it  contains adult language (lots of four and twelve-letter words).",958176000,,2021,4.872781065088757
1725135,5,B000068DBD,"Jackie Brown is Tarantino's most well-rounded movie;it flows much more smoothly than Pulp Fiction, and it doesn't seem over too soon like Reservoir Dogs.  The cast is delightful and the plot is somewhat  believable.  I haven't finished the book yet, but every part (save for the  beginning) parallels the movie, which is very lengthy, but seems over in  just the right amount of time.  I don't feel like writing much more, so  that's about it.",956188800,,443,4.826666666666667
1725136,5,B000068DBD,"Just to dismiss this factor, Tarantino is not black and should not be writing stories about black experiences. But, considering the degree of ignorance within him that we all know exists, he comes through with an  excellent final product in this case. The entire cast delivers OSCAR worthy  performances and one has to respect Tarantino for never making his film's  predictable. The man has genius flowing from every opening in his body.  This film, however, does not belong in the DRAMA category. And, for those  reviewers out there who hate Tarantino for his blatant admiration for black  people, you didn't have to watch the movie.

Maybe it's because it's not an original  screenplay.  I found the whole thing rather long, drawn out and tedious.  (BTW, Reservoir Dogs is my favorite film of all time, so this isn't an  anti-QT posting.)  I just didn't care for this one.",956188800,,414,4.589041095890411

1725139,4,B000068DBD,"Three years after his instant classic ""Pulp Fiction"", Quentin Tarantino came back with ""Jackie Brown"" which was not nearly as well received by audiences and critics than the ealier film. Though JB is  not quite on par with PF, it is a good film worth of respect.
One of the  major assets of this picture is the outstanding cast. Pam Grier, Robert  DeNiro and Samuel L. Jackson deliver fine performances and Robert Forster  is the standout of the fantastic supporting cast. Tarantino's script does  not disappoint too. His dialogue is even better than Elmore Leonard's  original. As in his previous pics, Tarantino effectively uses source music  throughout the film. If there's any downside than it is the running time.  155 minutes are too many for a film like this.

The dialogue is excellent in  spots, and the actors time everything just right, but there's never that  spark of genius that propelled ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservoir  Dogs."" The picture starts well but the tension never builds and the  story never explodes like it should. It's still watchable, and great in  spots, but it's not the movie that ""Pulp Fiction"" was.

Ironic then that this is the criticism laid at the door of the  vastly superior Jackie Brown. ""Too long"", ""Not enough  action"", ""Nowhere nearly as good as Pulp Fiction""....well  sorry but I am more than happy to remain in the minority. I have rarely  been so emotionally bound up in a movie, and this is largely due to the  superlative performances of Pam Grier and Robert Forster. This movie is set  up to be a classic from the off, with a superb choice of Title Track laid  over Griers immediate opening appearance rushing to work! I genuinely  empathise with her character from this moment, and the film never forces me  to let go. Those who consider it boring clearly have a narrow view of a  good film, there is not a moment that is not of interest, and if the pace  seems leisurely then GOOD!, you simply enjoy yourself  longer. (Again in  contrast to general opinion I found the multi-perspective shopping mall  scene immensely enjoyable). I admit to having no strong views on the degree  of swearing, it did not seem overly gratuitous to me, however. For the  record Samuel L.

7964137,5,B000068DBD,"I've been a fan of QT for over 25 years. He's my absolute favorite director of all time and with my bias I think every one of his films is a masterpiece. Jackie Brown is the odd one out of his films but it's still a great film. Since this movie is ""so old"" I won't warn of spoilers. Watch it now! Pam Grier is like a fine wine. You know the saying and this is her finest moment of her illustrious career. A female lead in this type of film is a rarity but I think QT really set the bar, then reprised it with Kill Bill 1 & 2. He doesn't care if you're a woman, black, white, whatever. He has a vision and he gets it done and in this movie he gets it done. If he makes Robert DeNiro, one of the most iconic actors ever seem like a background character you know he's doing something right. The whole cast, plot and especially soundtrack is absolutely incredible. One of the best soundtracks of all time. I have every QT film on DVD or Blu Ray and this is without a doubt the most under appreciated. My friends that don't know too much about movies are always taken aback when I tell this it's a QT movie, then they want to see it. It's a great flick for all occasions. Really. Watch it with friends, lovers, strangers. It'll have everyone marveling by the time the 2.5 hours is up. I wish it were longer. A movie that doesn't even seem like a movie.
