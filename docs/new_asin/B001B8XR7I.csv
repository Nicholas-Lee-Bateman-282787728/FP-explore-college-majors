3700498,5,B001B8XR7I,"Caught this by accident on Netflix and bought copies to share with others for christmas. You have NO idea where this story is going to go. It does not talk down to the viewer, just throws you into the world it has created and runs non-stop for almost four hours.

You could take a breather after night watch to let it sink in. I'd recommend it; Just to savor all you have seen. The action scenes are not too long, the stunts truly awesome and inspired. The characters and actors all spot on.",1389398400,5,491,4.279569892473118

8321931,5,B001B8XR7I,"Great movie that goes way beyond the usual good vs bad formula. Not your typical horror movie either, it has a complex storyline and builds up slowly. The best way to watch this is after reading the first 3 books by Sergei Lukyanenko, which this movie and it's predecessor night watch are loosely based on.",1505865600,,306,4.581818181818182

8321935,4,B001B8XR7I,"Fans of the original will surely love this follow up, but it is never anything great. Day Watch is good, but leaves a lot be desired. I thought that the film was well constructed with a prominent sense of style, which is a trademark of Bekmambetov's films. Day Watch in many ways is a better film than Night Watch because it expands on the story established in the first entry. Night Watch was a film that was all over the place with its plot and relied on its visual style to create its entertainment value. Although similar, this film tones down on heavy special effects and focusing more on storytelling. But that's not saying that effects are not prominent in the film. There are plenty of scenes that have effects and are quite exciting, but the plot is better thought out here and the film is a more focused, more detailed movie. The performances are good and there are aspects of the film should appeal genre fans. However as a whole, the sequel doesn't break any new ground in terms of vampire lore. I enjoyed the film, but I felt it could have been better and it was on par with the original.",1473379200,,1101,4.428571428571429
