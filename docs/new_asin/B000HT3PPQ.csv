2642336,5,B000HT3PPQ,"At long last one of my favorite films has finally made it to DVD and I can throw my TV copy VHS away. O Henry has always been a favorite writer of mine and it just so happens that he is buried right here in Asheville, North Carolina. If you visit his grave you will find coins on it in honor of THE GIFT OF THE MAGI. I remember first seeing this film on television back in the early 1960s. I was especially taken by the story of THE LAST LEAF (and still am today). It spurred me on to find and read other O Henry short stories where I then discovered that he had written well over two hundred of them!

For this 1952 omnibus film 5 stories were chosen (THE COP AND THE ANTHEM, THE CLARION CALL, THE LAST LEAF, THE RANSOM OF RED CHIEF, and of course MAGI) along with 5 different directors (Howard Hawks, Henry Hathaway, Henry King, Henry Koster, Jean Negulesco) and a top notch cast (Charles Laughton, Richard Widmark, Anne Baxter, Fred Allen, Jeanne Crain and a young Marilyn Monroe). To top it all off 20th Century Fox got author John Steinbeck to introduce the stories. As is often the case with anthology films the stories are a mixed bag with ANTHEM, LEAF, and MAGI being first rate while THE CLARION CALL and THE RANSOM OF RED CHIEF miss the mark due to lack of subtlety in direction and in some of the performances (RED CHIEF was cut after the premiere but restored for TV showings).

Nevertheless this release is a 5 star effort all the way thanks to a beautifully restored print and a slew of informative extras including two silent shorts, a trip to the O. Henry Museum in Austin, Texas and no less than a recording of O Henry himself done in the mid 1900s (he died in 1910). An excellent example of the old studio system school of filmmaking at its best and a great incentive to check out the original stories which had to be altered and expanded for the movie (ie. THE LAST LEAF is only 3 pages long in a full size edition).",1167868800,64,1935,4.284153005464481
2642337,5,B000HT3PPQ,"I read these stories in grade school many years ago. I also have the Audio cassette tape that had the gift of the magi on it. Just wasn't the same. I saw this movie a long time ago on AMC & enjoyed it very much! I was supprised to see that they had a copy in the store the other day. I bought it right away. These 5 stories are really wonderful!  The acting is very good. If you like old movies with a sentimental theme, then you will enjoy these short stories. They are all very good & one is very, very funny! (The ransom of Red Chief-Starring Fred Allen). As another reviewer put it, these stories are great for a cold winter night or watching your with family. There is a good bunch of stars in this movie. Charles Laughton, Marlin Monroe, Anne Baxter, Fred Allen & Many others. I Highly recommend this movie.",1167782400,2,813,4.211538461538462

Henry authored hundreds of short stories that are easily available to this day.  His stories are wide ranging about the various aspects of life of the common man.  Some of his stories are full of humor, some are full of pathos.  These five stories are a really nice sample of the range of O. Henry.  The actors are excellent.

Instead, when I started watching it, they had completely changed the story from a girl catching pneumonia because it was going around to a girl getting sick because she had caught her boyfriend cheating on her, went out in the cold and got sick.  She admitted to her sister of having sex with him. In the story, they are roommates, not sisters. I wish I had known this before I bought the movie.",1447718400,4,537,4.264705882352941

2642437,4,B000HT3PPQ,"My pick in order of the 5 short stories are:
1. The Cop and the Anthem with an excellent performance by Charles Laughton as the hobo looking for a warm bed and food to carry him through the harsh winter.
2. The Gift of the Magi with good performances from Farley Granger and Jeanne Crain as a young couple who individually were willing to sacrifice much to give their partner a valuable Christmas gift to show their love for one another.
3. The last Leaf a very symbolic story for one facing death. I am a bit biased here as Jean Peters is a favourite actress of mine. She and Anne Baxter played the part of sisters well and the sacrifice made by the old painter upstairs was very touching.
There is little between ""The Ransom of Red Chief "" and ""The Clarion Call"". I had trouble getting into the story lines of these two. At a pick though I found the acting in ""The Clarion Call"" grating with Richard Widmark's laugh annoying and Dale Robertson's acting wooden. Overall though, a good movie experience with the added bonus of John Steinbeck's introductions to the stories.",1423440000,,1073,4.507692307692308

2642458,5,B000HT3PPQ,"there really should be more ""anthology"" films like this one. every great writer deserves to see his work on the Silver Screen, but what if they, like the former William Sidney Porter, have more of a knack for short stories than novels? of course there are those who try to ""flesh out"" a story and give it fit length for a feature film. well, that's not necessarily a recipe for disaster, but there is another way.
(one word of warning: O. Henry is well-known as the master (sometimes a bit overzealously called the inventor) of the twist ending or ""snapper."" so the question is, can i write an effective review without resorting to ""spoilers?"" we'll see.)
we begin with one of the author's most amusing farces, ""The Cop & The Anthem."" a big city derelict, played by Charles Laughton, pines for the shelter of prison as winter encroaches. in the best tradition of what would come to be called ""screwball comedy,"" he is repeatedly stymied in his attempts to get himself arrested.
next in line is a taste of hard-boiled film noir called ""The Clarion Call."" a reporter, played by Dale Robertson, knows who's guilty in a high profile series of murders because the culprit, played by Richard Widmark, is an old acquaintance. but alas, an old debt makes it difficult for Robertson to bring Widmark to justice.
we then come to the tearjerker ""The Last Leaf."" a young woman played by Anne Baxter is debilitated by pneumonia. her sister, played by Jean Peters, and a painter who lives downstairs, played by Gregory Ratoff, do what they can to encourage her to recover, but it turns out to be an uphill battle. particularly when Baxter becomes fixated on the ""creeper"" vine she sees out her window, convincing herself that she'll last only so long as ""the last leaf"" to fall does.
my favorite O. Henry story is probably ""The Ransom Of Red Chief."" two miscreants, played by Fred Allen and Oscar Levant, come to rural Alabama planning to kidnap the son of an influential small town sheriff. the kid turns out to be as rambunctious a little spitfire as ever reduced an adult to tears, and Daddy concocts a novel way of simultaneously recovering his child and humbling our would-be villains.
(incredibly, studio muckety-mucks disliked this segment and demanded it be removed. it wasn't reinstated for a couple of decades, and the film is the stronger for it.)
and what could be a more fitting curtain-call than O. Henry's signature piece? when you name the great Christmas-related works of literature, ""The Gift Of The Magi"" seems to run second only to Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol."" this touching tale of an impoverished young couple who go to extremes to get presents for each other is a miracle of sorts for being sentimental but not sappy. or maybe it's just Christmas that let you get away with that. either way, there's a reason this one is on The Record as THE O. Henry story.
our host for this little testimonial is John ""Of Mice & Men"" Steinbeck. on top of the obligatory signing of O. Henry's praises and expounding of the sociological significance of his work, Steinbeck offers a bare-bones biography, outlining a bit of his exploits and how he came to take New York to heart. the very first shot in the film is of O. Henry-to-be in jail. i can't help thinking it's kind of a shame that no attempt is made to delve deeper into the matter, to make clear that he didn't quite deserve that incarceration. (he was accused of embezzling from a bank he worked in, but ultimately exonerated.) either way, you have to respect the film for not trying to sugarcoat the way such films of this age would be more inclined toward.
on the whole, the only major potential disappointment is the inevitable you-can't-please-everybody factor. O. Henry's more rabid admirers are bound to have favorites who's absence they'll mourn. the big question in my own mind is, why is O. Henry's most famous character, safecracker Jimmy Valentine, only mentioned in passing? of course, we do get a clip of him releasing the little girl from the bank vault, so who knows, maybe a fully version was filmed but vetoed. but again, why?
oh well. this is a largely engrossing film, bristling with heart, humor, and the occasional suspense, just as did O. Henry himself on the page. it's both a fitting tribute for the initiated and a fine introduction for the uninitiated.",1419033600,2,4331,4.722589167767503

John Steinbeck, even in his sober way, cannot help to communicate his towering respect for the master of paradox. As to that figure of speech, Mr. Steinbeck attests to it by at once exuding his highest esteem and deepest admiration for O. Henry. This could only be missed by the most obtuse. The stories are given real flesh by a superb ensemble; to identify a few would be to neglect the many that are equally worthy.

My least favorite is ""Ransome of Red Chief"" because I never liked that story particularly but the acting by Fred Allen and Oscar Levant is outstanding. The duo is at their best dealing with a young man more conniving than they are. I encourage you to see it for the performances as well as for the well written stories of Mr. Henry.

Marilyn Monroe is an added treat as a street walker in The Cop and the Anthem - just a pleasant story and it shares a slice of life that so few of us still remember. Gift of the Magi is perfectly casted and so very sweet. Ransom of Red Chief is so much better than the recent movie that it should not even be compared.

Especially fun is the tale of the poor bum who is trying to get arrested and thrown in jail for the winter but no matter what he does (including trying to accost Marilyn Monroe), he can't get arrested until he makes the mistake of having a spiritual reawakening in church.

O Henry, wrote of people's sacrifices and selflessness.  Something we can all learn from.  This DVD is not always easy to find and I really appreciate it that Amazon offerd this.

I purchased this DVD mainly because I want to collect all of Marilyn Monroe's movies that she had appeared in, however small they are. I was not expecting this to be short stories, but a regular movie. I rate it at okay for content of the short stories, as all of them could not hold my interest. Like I previously stated, the first movie short I did like with Marilyn Monroe. Marilyn Monroe has a small part in this story, just to let you know.
Happy Viewing!",1362614400,,3392,5.075268817204301

2642519,5,B000HT3PPQ,"We own the VHS of this and wanted to upgrade our media. It is a very good set of stories, well done for its day. The stories are timeless and wanted to expose our grandkids to some stories that caused you to think.

2642534,5,B000HT3PPQ,"I use this video with my literature classes to teach the elements of fiction. The stories are classic O. Henry, and though they are shot in black and white--ca. 1950--the students still get the idea. Each one is short--less than 15 minutes, so they are easy to watch and discuss in an hour. Having John Steinbeck introduce them is a plus.",1353974400,,338,4.557377049180328
2642535,2,B000HT3PPQ,"I am disappointed. William Sidney Porter in 'The Ransom Of Red Chief' never spoke of Bill and Sam riding into Summit, AL in an out of tune car. Nor did Ebenezer Dorset hold the position of sheriff. The locals had Down East accents, not a hint of Alabama Southern. There was no bear disrupting the campsite, and the hilarity of the ransom note is lost. Soapy of 'The Cop and the Anthem' didn't have a sidekick. The newspaper in 'The Clarion Call' was never called 'The Clarion,' but rather, 'The Morning Mars.' The scriptwriters could have and should have remained true to the stories, embellishing a little to stretch for time. However, the 2 stars come from the extras, which give a background on the O.Henry Museum n Austin, and the expert review of the author's life.",1346889600,2,770,4.627737226277373

I have often searched over the years to see if these were available so was thrilled when I found this DVD at Amazon.com. The Gift of the Magi really shows the love two people can feel for each other when they put the other person before themselves.  All of these stories have great meaning and makes one think of gentler times when people had more consideration of others.
I am sure I will enjoy all the films as much as the two aforementioned.",1308528000,,682,4.3700787401574805
2642552,5,B000HT3PPQ,This is a great video.  If you like O'Henry - you will love this adaptation of his short stories.

2642553,5,B000HT3PPQ,"This movie is terrific!  So many stars from the 50's.  Seeing John Steinbeck, a great American novelist himself, introduce each of the five O'Henry short stories is an added bonus.  I highly recommend this DVD.

2642556,4,B000HT3PPQ,"This is a pot pourri of a film, with the first three episodes by far the best.  It is always a delight to see Laughton hamming away when is is absolutely the right way to do it.  My own favourite is the 3rd episode, with Jean Peters in a fiercely restrained mood, making for real sentiment.  A pity she was never given more opportunity to show her strength.",1253750400,,357,4.220588235294118

2642559,5,B000HT3PPQ,"Fox offers us five stories with five top directors and 14 great stars of the time.
The best out of the five are: Gift of the Magi and The Last Leaf.
Best acting in this film - and there were some noteworthy performances by most of the stars involved - is Jean Peters. She gives a contained, brilliant performance as Anne Baxter's sister in The Last Leaf; and does most of the acting (while Anne just lays in bed worried about the falling leaves). Gregory Ratoff is also good as the unsuccessful painter. If she hadn't married Howard Hughes, Miss Peters would have probably become one of the best actresses in Hollywood (in her era - the 50s). She was also a gorgeous looking female. I also enjoyed seeing Laughton, Granger and Crain",1233705600,,732,4.511278195488722

2642573,5,B000HT3PPQ,"These short movies came highly recommended to me, by a woman I met in a McDonald's a month ago.  I immediately did an internet search looking for them and found them on Amazon.  I watched them with my parents and we absolutely loved the moral in each story.  They're simple, yet effective in getting the moral of the story across to the viewer.  Great for all ages.  They're in black and white, but goes well with the story,...I soon forgot about that since I was so focused on the moral. Suprised I didn't view these in high school classes when I was younger.  Great for Christmas time!",1230681600,,587,4.4392523364485985
2642574,5,B000HT3PPQ,"I waited a long time for this one to be released.  O'Henry is one of my most favorite authors, up there with Mark Twain. This film appealed to me in my youth because it was narrated by another great author, John Steinbeck.  This is the only honest treatment of O'Henry and his work, unless you know of another -- please clue me in.  The Last Leaf and The Gift of the Magi are priceless stories, told so well in this film.  Also, seeing a young and beautiful Marilyn Monroe does a body good.  The quality of the DVD is very good and I have enjoyed watching it a couple of times since I received it.  It's one in my collection that I brag about, however I don't like to loan it out.  I'd hate to have to kill a friend if they failed to return it!",1218326400,,744,4.054794520547945

Two of the best stories in the group:  The Last Leaf, featuring Baxter and Peters and The Gift of the Magi, featuring Crain and Farley Granger.  A nice package altogether for this classic omnibus feature film.",1205971200,3,462,5.0394736842105265
2642576,5,B000HT3PPQ,"O'Henry is a master story-teller.  He combines laughter, tears, happiness all in one story.  Too bad there were not more writers of this caliber. My favorite - Gift of the Magi...truly uplifting.",1203120000,2,195,5.0625
2642577,4,B000HT3PPQ,"One aspect of this film that no one mentioned: A rare treat, the chance to see Richard Widmark do Tommy Udo again!  His character has a different name this time (Johnny Kiernan), and his nickname for people he doesn't like has changed (""clamhead"" instead of ""squirt""), but the rest is pretty much the same.  He doesn't push an old lady down the stairs here, but he does slap a bartender around for the way he sings, ""Camptown Races.""

I loved the way these stories showed O. Henry's range as an author, as well as Steinbeck's enthusiasm about a fellow author. It's a shame that more people haven't seen this movie, but it is a gem, and you should jump at the chance to get it.",1200700800,4,414,4.1234567901234565
2642579,5,B000HT3PPQ,"O.Henry will always be remembered for his endearing short stories with a surprising twist at the end.  Just as important, his characters were real people the common man could identify with.  The average Joe, the man-on-the-street, the struggling homemaker---these were the memorable people O.Henry chose to write about and they made a lasting impression on anyone who ever read one of his stories.  As O.Henry himself once said, ""There are stories in everything. I've got some of my best yarns from park benches, lampposts, and newspaper stands.""

Rather than take one story and pad it out into a two-hour movie, Hollywood made the wise decision of selecting five of his stories and stringing them together for one movie.  The idea worked and was enhanced by starring some of the most famous actors of the day in each story.  Another bonus is that celebrated writer John Steinbeck appears at the beginning of each story with a helpful introduction.

""The Gift of the Magi"" from his collection The Four Million is perhaps his most widely read story and is arguably the crowning jewel of this video collection as well.  Jeanne Crain and Farley Granger portray the young married couple short on cash but long on love who each desire to give the other a perfect Christmas present.

""The Cop and the Anthem"" from the same collection stars Charles Laughton as Soapy, an elegant hobo who decides that the best way to stay warm in the winter is to get arrested and have a warm bed and three square meals a day in the city jail.  David Wayne accompanies him on his attempts to get arrested and a sultry streetwalker portrayed by the legendary Marilyn Monroe adds spice to the escapade.

""The Clarion Call"" from The Voice of the City pairs Richard Widmark as a well-to-do hoodlum and Dale Robertson as a successful detective.  They are boyhood friends with an old score to settle and settle it they do when a murder is committed.

""The Last Leaf"" from his collection The Trimmed Lamp is one sure to bring a tear to your eye.  Anne Baxter and Jean Peters star in this touching story of a sick young woman who believes she will die when the last leaf has been blown from a tree outside her window.  A frustrated artist attempts to lift her spirits one snowy night.

""The Ransom of Red Chief"" from Whirligigs is perhaps the weakest link in this collection.  A strong and extremely humorous story when read loses some of its punch due, in my opinion, to less than stellar acting by Fred Allen and Oscar Levant as two kidnappers who have the tables turned on them.  Preview audiences who saw the film agreed and this entry was removed from the original film when it opened in 1952.  It was not restored to the original film until it reached television and is now included on this DVD.

Fans of classic movies will enjoy these playful and optimistic tales set in New York, the city O.Henry once lovingly referred to as Baghdad-on-the-Subway.",1200268800,18,2925,4.686888454011742

2642595,5,B000HT3PPQ,"As O'Henry's stories are legendary it seems appropriate that a topnotch, legendary cast led by top directors of the time should come together to present these five shorts.  Since other reviewers have done a good job of iterating the history and credits for these films, I'll simply add a few personal comments.  Some have mentioned the uneven aspects of a couple of these films, mentioning some are stronger than others.  To this I say O'Henry wrote in different voices.  His stories are each their own, his topics mixed and varied.  I suggest the viewer enjoy each story for what it is completely unique from the others.  And most wonderfully each story is introduced by John Steinbeck, my favorite most admired American author.  What a treat.  The extras round everything off very nicely.

It's your choice. Buy wisely!",1497052800,,406,4.985294117647059
