7413961,4,B014K5F0QO,"A little boy from the tiny farming community of Tulelake, California wishes that he could be Batman. He has just completed a round of chemo in his three-year battle with leukemia; his wish reaches the ears of a local Make-a-Wish organizer.

This PG-rated documentary illustrates the jaw-dropping power of social media as it follows this 5-year-old cancer patient as he gets his wish courtesy of the Make-A-Wish Foundation in San Francisco. The idea caught fire on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc. (the statistics are astounding), and resulted in a phenomenal day in his life, the lives of Make-a-Wish personnel and the happy citizens of San Francisco. In addition, this excellent documentary became a film festival favorite.

We see:
  * Miles Scott is our central character who has been battling leukemia. This was very much on my mind when our little guy had to climb that daunting flight of stairs near the end of his long, long day....
  * Patricia Wilson is the Make-a-Wish spark-plug behind the event. She was hoping for ""maybe 20 people to pretend to be a crowd.""
  * Ama Daetz is the television newscaster who broadcast an appeal for help and asked Batkid to watch for a message from the Chief of Police.
  * Eric Johnston is the creative genius who designed the tools and choreographed the ""rescues."" He taught Batkid the secret handshake and also filled in as Batman.
  * Sue Graham Johnston is the Damsel in Distress strapped to a bomb on the trolley tracks who must be saved by Batkid. Watch what happens to her leather jacket and purse.
  * Mike Jutan works for Industrial Light and Magic. He is The Penguin. Hear what happens when he goes to China.

The awesome effect of one small boy's wish reverberates through the Police Department, the Mayor's Office, the costume department of the San Francisco Opera, San Francisco Cable Cars, AT&T (baseball) Park and countless other local participants. It also generated national and international interest, with cards, letters, emails, etc., from well-wishers around the world, plus all of the actors who had portrayed Batman and greetings from both President and Mrs. Obama.

I'm just naming some of the participants, you have to watch the movie to see what they do! Just the astonishing size of the crowd alone and its amazing behavior is worth the price of admission. There are times it's an honor to be a human being. This is one of them....",1442188800,3,2403,4.867321867321867

7413963,5,B014K5F0QO,Such a wonderful documentary that will restore your faith and hope in the power of people wanting to work together to do something for the greater good of others!!!!,1462665600,,165,4.724137931034483
7413964,5,B014K5F0QO,"I was in the Bay Area during this event. I saw the premier of the unfinished film during Cinequest in San Jose and I thought they did a great job then. Now that I have seen the finished production I think it is even better. It shows the true story of how the effort to grant a simple wish snowballed beyond anyone's dreams and, seemingly, beyond any control. Yet, thousands of strangers came together and a city showed what could be done. I will watch this movie again and again. If you ever think people just don't care watch this.",1459814400,,532,4.33
7413965,5,B014K5F0QO,"This just might be the best thing I have ever watched.  It's fun, reminds you of being a kid, and reminds you that there is still good in this world.  I would recommend this movie to everyone, regardless of their age or interests.  It teaches a great lesson while inspiring the audience.  I was brought to tears multiple times simply by the good that was shown in everyone involved in this movie.  Highly recommended.",1459296000,,417,4.581081081081081
7413966,5,B014K5F0QO,"Watch this feel-great documentary with people of any age.  No foul language, nudity, or awkwardness in this video- it's just a great story told well to uplift your spirit when you press ""Play"".  This documentary tells the true story of a Make-A-Wish Foundation's fulfillment of a leukemia patient's wish to be Batman for a day, and how this idea turned into a world-wide outpouring of love for the idea, and a little boy who deserved the adventure of a lifetime.  Without being maudlin, or self-congratulatory, all the participants recount what they did and how SF turned itself out (and into Gotham!) because we all remember what it was like to be a kid with a dream.  This story is inspiring, and well told.

This film-maker (Kuenne's) is very skilled, and if you've never seen his show, ""Dear Zachary"", I recommend that one, too although it is the opposite situation - a real-life crime drama that goes from bad to worse with the involvement of the Canadian justice system.  It's a tribute to Kuenne's best friend, Dr. Andrew Bagby, and the Bagby family, as the film-maker explains in his own words.  You'll invariably get the feeling you know these people and love the Bagby family but again, this is show is not for all ages the way Batkid is.",1458777600,,1248,4.697247706422019

7413977,5,B014K5F0QO,"I loved seeing all the efforts Make-A-Wish made to make this young man's wish a reality. It is amazing how one wish can bring together family, friends, community and in this case, the world. Make-A-Wish rocks!",1446854400,,209,4.833333333333333
7413978,5,B014K5F0QO,"I bought this as a former wish kid I really enjoyed watching Batkid's wish and how it captivated the world, but this film goes deeper in how the wish became what it was and the volunteers that helped make it possible. It's amazing how just a few people coming together could cause enough traction for this crazy wish",1446768000,,316,4.4655172413793105

The behind the scenes footage during the planning and execution of the wish is excellent and paints a detailed picture of what it's like to be a part of granting a wish with the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Even if you read the story, followed it on Facebook, or observed it in person, you'll be amazed by all that went into it and the stories of the people who helped out. If you want an uplifting story about humanity and to experience the magic of a wish - BUY THIS MOVIE!",1446595200,2,571,4.296296296296297
7413980,5,B014K5F0QO,"This documentary is a gem, from start to finish, as it chronicles one little boy's ""simple"" wish to ""be Batkid"" and the incredible amount of coordinated ""help"" it took to make that wish into a reality.  Everything about it was inspiring and heartwarming and just a joy to watch.  Keep a box of tissues nearby...you'll need it!",1444780800,,326,4.701754385964913
7413981,5,B014K5F0QO,"Batkid Begins is a documentary that explores the intense outpouring of spontaneous support for a five-year-old child nearing the end of his three-year treatment for leukemia. The San Francisco-based Make-A-Wish organization was ready to grant young Miles Scotts wish to be a superhero, specifically Batman, his favorite. Miles knew the superhero from the Adam West TV show, not the theatrical motion pictures that depicted the caped detective in a much darker manner. Miles and his dad had lots of time to bond over the show during the bleakest years of the boys illness.

San Francisco served as Gotham City for a day and the events grew beyond the resources of the Make-A-Wish foundation. Villainous plots for Miles Batkid alter ego were planned for the youngster to foil. Social networking played a vital part in obtaining volunteer contributions. The San Francisco Opera made the costumes, Apple volunteered its communications team to handle the press, acrobat/inventor Eric Johnson suited up as Batman to accompany Miles on his exploits, Dark Knight composer Hans Zimmer supplied music for the event, and San Franciscos mayor and chief of police enthusiastically acted as if they were running Gotham City. Even though the events of the day are covered in all their make-believe splendor, director Dana Nachman diligently focuses on Miles, outlining his medical history, the way his cancer threw his family into a tailspin, and the resilience and perseverance it took for the boy to get through his treatment.

This is a hard movie to resist. The looks on Miles face as he is immersed in the world of Batman can melt the most austere viewer. The documentary is an affirmation of the kindness and empathy of strangers when they know its directed to a child whos gone through tough times. There are no bonus features on the DVD release.",1443916800,3,1838,5.042763157894737

As if the story of this boy's fight w cancer wasn't enough, the entire planet gets behind his wish to be BatKid for a day.  It's simply awesome to watch Make-A-Wish, then San Francisco, then the US and ultimately the world pour out love and support for BatKid.  All those moving pieces came together. Made me cry more than once...",1517270400,,406,4.869565217391305
8731057,5,B014K5F0QO,Great movie that my kids enjoyed watching because it shows the reality of things that go on in other people's lives without the need to explain to much about the dying process but more about the sickness and what people do to help no matter how big or small. A good movie for kids to see in that light but also a fun ride to take along with batkid.,1486684800,,348,4.057971014492754

8731061,5,B014K5F0QO,"My dad became absaloutly obsessed with this stroy when it was first on the news, and as he's a pretty hard person to shop for I bought this for him for christmas. He loved it and it is now one of the only movies he requests when we all do a family movie night (this film, Star Dust, Big Fish, The English man who Went up a Hill and Came Down a Mountain, and Second Hand Lions... he has weird taste)",1472601600,,398,3.925925925925926
8731062,5,B014K5F0QO,"There are many films that ""tug at your heartstrings"", as the saying goes, and often I find it grating, saccharine, and irritating. It often comes across as exploitative and I feel pushed and battered over the head with a director seemingly screaming ""feel this way"" through every shot. In a very limited way this film does this but I can't help but be ""touched"" deep down in my bitter, black heart by what the people of SF did for Miles. It really makes this bitter old misanthrope reconsider my position that human beings are a despicable virus that should have been wiped off the Earth ages ago.

This movie (and obviously the M.A.W.F. and the city of S.F.)  make me less ashamed to be human. Cheers, San Francisco. You did good. You did real good.",1471910400,,750,4.548148148148148
