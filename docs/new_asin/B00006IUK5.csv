8304870,1,B00006IUK5,I actually got the wrong DVD.. The original DVD I wanted was actually just a bonus DVD from one of Pillar's CD's which I completely forgot about so I thought this DVD was the same as the bonus DVD. I was a bit disappointed when I watched this one and fuguyedx out it wasn't the one I was hoping for. But I'm stuck with this one now.. The DVD I really wanted was a bonous DVD from the rerelease Fireproof album.,1470873600,,410,4.074074074074074
8304871,1,B00006IUK5,"Unfortunately, I picked up 2 copys of this supposedly ""Christian"" Metal Band DVD from the local 99 cent store, one for my young nephew who plays in his Church Band, & one for our collection.  Unfortunately, I gave him his before I saw ours.

Absolute Garbage!

Christian ""Metal"" (I should have known) ... is that an oxyMoron?

Hey - I understand that music is by taste & generation  (to some degree) - but if this is truly a ""Christian"" Band - with some of the band members flashing their personal tribute to SATAN (the Devil's Horns Salute) - & with the obviously Demonic beat - then maybe the cockamamy THEORY of Evolution is true after-all (sic) & I am a monkeys uncle (LOL) ...

Listen if you like (why?) - but DON'T be deceived into thinking you are helping your spiritual journey & listening to honest Christian Music.  An unbeliever?  Why would one buy this garbage - worldly Metal is better ""musically"" & makes no pretenses of their Dark Agenda.

If you are a Christian - do yourself a favor & definitely AVOID THIS trash, & if you aren't - why would you want it?

This is ""music"" with NO real audience - with the possible exception of the deceived ... lol ...

Vaya con Dios

ps - I trashed the DVD & liner, so I got an empty DVD case out of the deal for .99, but - now I have to talk to my nephew/ bro ...

8304872,4,B00006IUK5,"To date Pillar is one of my favorite bands and they probably always will be. I love hard rock and metal and when it's christian (and actualy good) that is usualy a combination to make a band be my fav. They're not one of these christian bands that waters the message down soo much that it's almost unoticable anymore either.
This dvd is based mostly during the era of their ""Above"" cd. Although I do like that album it's my least favorite, but thats to be expected because it was their very first album it's also their rappiest (lol, is that a word?). I can't think of any band off the top of my head whos first album was up to par with their later music though. They do combine some of the ""Fireproof"" cd era on the dvd, but its mostly just on the dvd menu.
The dvd was bassically a bridge between the two albums. It also was before the rerelease of ""Fireproof"" which featured Lester on the drums. The dvd has their original drummer Brad on it.
Their is one music video on this dvd for the song ""open your eyes"", but other than that it's all just interviews with the band members, concert footage and some home movies that the Pillar homies sent in to try and prove how big of fans they all are.
I gave this dvd 4 stars because it's Pillar and like I said I love this band, but I can't give it 5 only because it's just not my favorite Pillar era. They started out sounding sort of like Limp Bizkit, but their new stuff leans more towards sounding like Disturbed/Pantera or at least I think so. If your a Pillar fan though, regardless which cd is your favorite. This dvd is a must have for your Pillar collection.",1085011200,3,1613,4.240259740259741
