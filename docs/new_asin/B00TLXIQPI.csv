7013036,3,B00TLXIQPI,"Although many reviewers have loved this movie and think it is hilarious, I'm not sure I would call this a comedy;  more of a Discomforting or a Cringing, with strained laughter at times.  It definitely isn't for everyone.  The Kristen Wiig of ""Bridesmaids"" is not the one you will see here.  She does a great job of portraying the character, no question;  but some people are not going to be amused by this portrayal of mental illness.  The supporting cast members all do a good job and actually may provide much of the humor, especially early on when Wiig's character is pitching her show to the TV studio.  And if you are offended by full frontal female nudity,this film might not be for you.",1431216000,33,694,4.548387096774194
7013037,5,B00TLXIQPI,Kristen Wiig is simultaneously hilarious and heartbreaking. So glad this was available immediately.,1431216000,,99,6.6923076923076925

7013040,5,B00TLXIQPI,"Kristen Wiig plays a woman with borderline personality disorder who wins the lottery and uses the money to put on her own TV show. While her character's lack of propriety makes the show funny, it becomes clear that she is really sick. As I understand it, borderline personality disorder is like having both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. It seems to me that people with serious mental illness focus so much on themselves and their disorder that they ignore the feelings of their friends and loved ones. The movie captured this very well.",1431129600,2,542,4.9021739130434785
7013041,4,B00TLXIQPI,"""Welcome To Me"" (2014 release; 88 min.) brings the story of Alice Klieg (played by Kristen Wiig). AS the movie opens, we see Alice waking up (at 12:15 pm), and going about her day-to-day routine. It is immediately clear that Alice isn't your usual person, and in fact later we learn that she suffers from borderline personality disorder. Alice watches the Oprah Show religiously (on old VHS tapes). At the end of the day, Alice settles in in front of her TV (which we later learn she's had on the same local channel for 11 years straight), and when the lottery numbers are announced, she is stunned to see that she won, all $87 million of it. At the lottery collection ceremony, Alice is cut off (from reading a prepared statement) for using unmentionable words, and she is infuriated. She decides to buy her way onto a cable channel and launches her own talk show called ""Welcome To Me"". At this point we are maybe 15 minutes into the movie. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from director Shira Piven (from 2011's ""Fully Loaded""), but with all due respect, the movie very much belongs to Kristen Wiig, who also co-produces. Let's state the obvious: without Wiig, we have no movie here, as Wiig is front and center from start to finish. It almost feels like a labor of love from Wiig. She plays a bizarre character convincingly, and then some. At some point in the movie, Alice totally loses it and goes walking stark-naked in the casino complex where she is renting a hotel room, to the stunned reaction of the casino patrons, and also us, the viewers on the other side of the screen. It was not clear to me for quite a long time what direction the movie ultimately would take or what the point of the movie is, but that reveals itself in the last 30 min. of the movie (no worries, I won't spoil). Another reviewer here mentions that this is Kristen Wiig ""at her most hilarious"", and while there are definitely some funny moments in the movie, I can't think of this movie or of Wiig as being ""hilarious"", as this is an off-center (and then some), dark comedy that raises more questions than it delivers laughs (on purpose, I might add). There are a bunch of supplementary roles that are worth noting, including from Jennifer Jason Leigh (as the cable channel executive), Tim Robbins (as Alice's shrink), Linda Cardellini (as Alice's best friend Gina), and Wes Bentley (as the TV host/cable channel part-owner).

This movie was shot over 2 years ago, and after making festival appearances last year, now finally has arrived in theaters. It showed up out of the blue at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The early evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great. Given the off-center and bleak tone of the movie, I can't imagine this will play very long in the theaters. I have to say, this is one of the stranger movies I have seen in quite some time. The movie grew on me as it played and it all went by in a flash, If you are a Kristen Wiig fan or simply in the mood for something that is MILES away from your standard Hollywood fare, this is worth checking out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.",1431129600,,3345,4.509060955518946
7013042,4,B00TLXIQPI,"Kristen Wiig is much more than a comedian. Her compulsion for a deeper look into humanity as portrayed in most of her works leads one to see the genius in her soul. Her attempts at disguising genius as humor result as a benefit to all that are smart enough to realize the fact that she, indeed, is one of the most talented actors alive.",1431129600,2,336,4.265625
7013043,5,B00TLXIQPI,"Kirsten Wiig nails it! She is fantastic. It has been a pleasure watching her career take off and this is her best mainstream work to date. This movie was funny, sad, and heart warming all in the same breath. A joy to watch! Go Groundlings alumni!",1431129600,14,246,4.369565217391305
7013044,4,B00TLXIQPI,"Many an SNL alum has walked away with hopes of turning their work on the small screen into big screen careers, but few have done it quite as well as Kristen Wiig in such a short amount of time. Bridesmaids was sort of like her big coming out party, but after refusing a sequel she's embarked on a number of smaller projects that allow her to flex rarely-used dramatic muscles. The Skeleton Twins is an excellent example of what she can do, while others like Hateship Loveship and Girl Most Likely lacked the inventive spark we're used to from her. Rest assured that is not an issue with the Shira Piven's hilariously wacky and touching Welcome to Me, a showcase for what Wiig can do when put front and center.

Unlike some of the larger films she's been a part of recently, Wiig essentially carries Welcome to Me all by herself. That's not to say the supporting cast, which consists of James Marsden, Joan Cusack, Alan Tudyk, Linda Cardellini, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Tim Robbins, are ineffectual it's just a statement on how good Wiig is. She plays Alice Klieg, a lonely recluse who watches old episodes of Oprah on VHS, stays up late watching shows on parakeets, and basically watching too much TV in general. In fact, her television hasn't been off in 11 years. Diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, Alice attends therapy sessions with Dr. Moffat (Tim Robbins), although she's recently decided to quit her meds in favor of a string cheese treatment. She has a best friend in Gina (Cardellini) but little else to her name, it seems. That all changes drastically when she hits the lotto and instantly becomes a mega-millionaire.

Rather than freaking out, Alice calmly makes the decision to reinvent herself as a talk show host, relying on Oprah's sage advice about self-confidence in the pursuit of one's dreams. Falling in with a low-rent television network barely above the UHF level, she agrees to pay them $15M to produce her own show, ""Welcome to Me"", so that she can talk all about herself. And what a show it turns out to be. The segments are an oddball assortment of reenacted events from Alice's cracked past, like ""Smelling Things Before They Happen"" and ""Someone Has Been Tampering With My Makeup Bag"". Or they delve into even darker, crueler territory such as the entire week Alice spends neutering dogs live on air. All this after she enters the show riding a mechanical swan, of course. The depths of Alice's narcissism (she often reads from formal prepared statements) know no bounds, and it never ceases to be funny, especially when the people around her (mostly the network employees) are left stupefied by it. The reactions on their faces looked exactly like mine watching Alice's unpredictable exploits; her moments of serenity that flip like a switch to utter insanity. There were times when I found myself yelling at the screen over her antics. A health nut (sorta), Alice's nutritional cooking segments end with long stretches where she simply sits down and eats on camera...in total silence, to stunned audiences.

Of course, Alice's show gains a following, but popularity has the drastic effect of increasing her self-delusion. But it also reveals the depth of her pain and loneliness, her extreme need for acceptance. She falls in love with practically every man who shows her any attention, from a sheepish infomercial host (Wes Bentley) to a young student (Thomas Mann) who adores the show.  Wiig is phenomenal here, showing Alice's growing confidence which coincides with the depth of her mental illness. We both pity her and root for her, but never once do we come to dislike Alice for some of the questionable choices she makes. The film loses some of its edge in an attempt to make sure Alice comes away smelling like a rose, but that is a small problem when she's such an original comic creation already. It's also good to see Wiig carrying the full comedic weight without having to share it with a male co-star. This is Wiig at her absolute best, and we can only hope she gets more chances like this to show what she can do.",1430524800,23,4071,4.778409090909091

7013051,4,B00TLXIQPI,3.5 Stars I love her work and like the movie but it's one you wished would end but can't stop watching. It is a lady that knows she is mental and needs help. Winning a lot of money she thought she could buy herself better. I'm glad she did but I have yet to understand how it helped the movie by her walking naked +17 through the lobby where she lived.,1500595200,2,352,3.971830985915493

7013053,3,B00TLXIQPI,"What an odd little movie with some big names attached to it.  I am now convinced that one of my friends has borderline personality disorder after watching this movie.  The crazy mood swings, the crying at the drop of a hat, the total narcissism, and the inability to let little slights go even years later.

7013063,4,B00TLXIQPI,"Very funny movie with great performances from everyone, especially Kristin Wiig as the protagonist, Alice Klieg. My only criticisms are that a few characters (namely the protagonist's parents) are thinly drawn considering their relationship to her, and that the penultimate scene of the character's breakdown is a bit predictable. The caveat to those critiques is that Alice is such a bigger-than-life character that everyone around her is sucked into her vortex. Still, I recommend the film highly for lovers of comedy, though I usually don't watch comedies.",1481932800,,559,5.436781609195402
7013064,4,B00TLXIQPI,Kristen Wiig turns in a wonderfully strange performance. This movie is very bizarre but I loved it anyway. It didn't make me laugh out loud that much but I did enjoy it.,1481241600,,169,4.3125

7013071,4,B00TLXIQPI,Kristen wigg shows incredible range in this not too dark comedy. As a patient with borderline let so personality Kristins character is hilarious as she navigates her new world as a millionaire with zero self awareness.

7013073,1,B00TLXIQPI,"I found the movie quite boring, and so has many others I've talked to about it. I overall didn't like the humor either, but some might find it funny I guess. It seemed to lack a point and story.
Further, I highly disliked the representation of borderline personality disorder. I am on my way to my PhD and this was NOT a good portrayal and did nothing to shed light on this devastating condition.... This movie made it seem like a joke and a quirk. Additionally, they made it seem like people with it are ""dumb"" and full of themselves. I have been wanting to find a movie that portrays it accurately, unlike some of the other movies that make those with the disorder seem ""violent."" Unfortunately, this movie still doesn't represent it very well.
It also provided wrong information about borderline (it was NOT called ""bipolar disorder"" at some point, like she said).",1468800000,,867,4.636363636363637

7013087,5,B00TLXIQPI,"I have watched this movie so many times ~ it will never get old for me, and both of these statements are incredibly RARE for me to make about a film! The writing is for a highly intelligent audience who loves wit and cleverness. I knew the masses would disapprove of this film, because the humor in it requires a keen perception and a mature attention span: both of which average American audiences lack, embarrassed to say as a U.S. citizen. But! For those of us who enjoy a well-written, well thought-out film with hidden humor that you may not catch the first time around, and desire a cast of characters with DEPTH ~ you will really love this film! I am online right now to buy it because I have rented it so many times, I could've owned it already. Just watch-out, this film is VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND IN WIDESCREEN. I am NOT a Kirsten Wiig fan and I loathe SNL, but this film is utterly brilliant and should've been nominated for numerous awards! A+++",1464912000,,956,4.406779661016949
7013088,2,B00TLXIQPI,"This movie had a lot of big name actors who all played their parts very well, but that was its only positive element. I didn't really feel sorry for the main character, I simply felt that she and the whole story were both shallow. I didn't think the sexual content or the swearing added any benefit or depth to the story, they were completely unnecessary and annoying.

7013097,1,B00TLXIQPI,"Yikes. First, making a comedy about mental illness is tricky business. This movie comes across as as a satire, which isn't good. It's almost unclear as to whether we're supposed to laugh in the scenes where Wiig's character is bottoming out emotionally. Second, the main character seems to be more narcissistic than borderline. Third, the happy ending comes out of nowhere--specifically, from superficial ""resolutions."" I appreciate that somebody wanted to produce a more accurate portrayal of borderline personality disorder than some older films, which depict the sufferers as violent and psychotic.

7013103,1,B00TLXIQPI,"I'm very annoyed about the sexuality in this film. Kristin Wiig went too far with explicit activity. It ruined an otherwise charming story and character. And she goes completely nude, showing full frontal. It was super disappointing and off putting. It was gross and I had to look away. Besides that, the ending was stupid. The way everything got wrapped up left me scrunch-faced and going, ""Huh? Why did she (the character) do that? Lame!""",1454371200,3,440,4.88
7013104,4,B00TLXIQPI,"Watching Oprah makes women crazy!  JK.  Kristen Wiig plays a weirdo with borderline personality/ bipolar disorder.  Actually, I wouldn't say her defining characteristic is her mental illnesses, but instead it's her selfishness.  Granted, she's not as in control of her emotional outbursts as other people because of her borderline personality, but her strangeness is mainly because she only cares about herself.  imho.

What I'm saying is that this isn't a simplistic and formulaic movie about mental illness.  It's for people who have a bit of perspective-- not the average judgmental hypocrites who think they got it all figured out.. If you're able to look at unbalanced people as human beings and not as walking illnesses to be pitied and treated you may find some humor in this.. I wasn't cringing nearly as often as I thought I might be..  But what the heck is with Kristen Wiig's perfect body?!?  I guess on one level it takes courage to take it all off.  But for a person with a case of the shut-in crazies, she shoulda chunked it up a bit.  To walk around naked with cellulite and a muffin top-- now *that* would have taken some courage!  I wouldn't even mention the full frontal nudity, but her body was just too perfect.  A nekkid lady should have some jiggle..

Anyhoo.  I could see myself giving Welcome To Me anywhere from two to four stars depending on my mood.  I watched the entire movie and I usually lose interest in stuff halfway through so that's the main reason for my four stars.

7013169,2,B00TLXIQPI,"From the opening moments when she wakes up at 12:15, its apparent that Kristen Wiig's character Alice Klieg has a messy life. She also has Borderline Personality Disorder, one of the hardest (if not *the* hardest) personality disorders to treat. One day, Alice wins an $86 million jackpot. She goes off her meds (much to the chagrin of her therapist, played by Tim Robbins) and weasels her way into convincing a local television studio head to give her a show: she wants 100 episodes of a show about herself (called Welcome to Me) and while its clear that shes unstable and impulsive, its also clear that shes loaded; when shes told that each episode will cost $150,000 and it would add up to $15 million overall, she pulls out her checkbook and starts writing.

The film does have some interesting things to say about the fact that people with BPD often behave in very selfish and narcissistic ways, which usually comes from a place of extreme delusion and woundedness. I love the fact that while this is a comedy involving BPD, it never makes light of the illness; it understands and has empathy for people who have it. Kristen Wiig is obviously hilarious, but in this film, she continues her streak of showing off some really strong acting chops.

The cast is first-rate and the premise is interesting, but Welcome To Me doesnt really work. Not very much happens, and even at 88 minutes, it feels somehow bloated. Theres also a lot of details that make this film feel very half-assed: Alices social circle seems to be composed entirely of her best friend Gina (played by Linda Cardellini) and her parents, and the fact that a) all of these people are always together and b) nobody is calling her out on impulsively spending $15 million is a tad implausible. There is a touch of satire on reality show culture and how networks are willing to put just about anything on airregardless of the ethics of how its producedif it can be financially advantageous to them, but its been done before and better in films like Network and Natural Born Killers. Welcome to Me is a competently made film that has its heart in the right place, but ultimately, it just doesn't add up to much.",1439683200,,2176,4.64935064935065

The Oprah knock-off formulated by Wiig's suddenly-rich Lotto winner ""off her meds""  includes such priceless segments as a meatloaf ""cake"" iced with mashed sweet potatoes, a vignette dramatizing the violation of her make-up bag by hotel personnel, and the settling of childhood vendettas.",1439596800,,605,5.28125

I was not able to watch it to the end, because it failed to inspire any emotions whilst watching, or even cheap laughs. Not funny at all. Every single character was ugly, ugly ugly, inside and out except the ""best friend"" who was inauthentic. Someone with an awkwardness factor and low coolness factor on a par with the main character would have an impossible time having and maintaining friendships, yet here she's got this perfect BFF who questions nothing and looks out for her. Mentally steady people seldom have friends like that. Insulting to the hardships of even the most minor mental health issue be-sodden person who's actually suffering the according loneliness. Worst of all it wasn't ever funny. Not once. More...disgusting, but not even in a mesmerizing way where you could keep watching it, say, like ""Hoarders"". Life is too short for this movie.

It's a rather uncomfortable portrayal of someone with mental instabilities.  That being said, Kristen Wiig is fantastic in this movie.  It never feels like she's poking fun at the rather heavy subject, but instead plays nicely and subtly within the confines of the story.  The movie boasts a great supporting cast -- and was rather enjoyable to watch, but I mean it when I say it's uncomfortable.  I found myself laughing at moments only because I didn't know how else to react.  My partner who watched this with me felt misled by the classification -- and I agree.  It's more a self-discovery movie than a comedy -- which is fine, however to classify it as an out and out comedy, especially with Wiig in the title role, leaves you somewhat unsatisfied at the end.",1439078400,,871,4.684210526315789

I really enjoyed this movie, in part because you didn't know what was going to happen next.

Stellar cast, Kristen Wiig showcasing her comedic skills in grandiose style, quirky and original plot...all of the elements were there, but none of it gelled or worked at all. Not only was this movie slow and painful to watch, Kristen's choices in portraying a character with Borderline Personality Disorder were odd (to say the least). Anyone who has actually known someone with BPD can tell you that this portrayal was completely off-base. She played her subdued and almost child-like, as if the woman had suffered from a developmental disorder, not a mental illness. That was the biggest flaw in a series of strange, un-funny, and cringe-worthy scenes in this movie that I cannot recommend. At all. Skip it.

7013219,1,B00TLXIQPI,"I really wanted to love this. Kristen Wiig is one of the funniest people alive, and I always enjoy her work. Well...I guess I can't say ""always"" anymore. Welcome to Me is so, SO bad. Unwatchably bad. I cringed for her in almost every scene. Amazingly, I made it all the way to the end credits, because that's how much I wanted to find something to like about it.

I think the one thing that bothered me the most about the whole debacle is the presentation of what a person with borderline personality disorder is like. I have a friend with BPD and have done a bit of reading about it in the past, and Wiig's portrayal of it is just bizarre. She appeared to play someone with developmental disabilities or maybe a past severe head injury. I'm certainly no expert and I don't mean to offend people who suffer from BPD, but man, this was weird. It was so odd and so out of place that I have to wonder why they gave her character this affliction.

Then there's the plot. Oh, no. She wins the lottery just as she has gone off her meds. A huge Oprah fan, she decides to buy her own television talk show production through the producers of an infomercial. Absolutely no hilarity ensues. As she spirals downward without her medication, she neuters dogs live on her show, stages humiliating reenactments of childhood embarrassments, and ultimately appears in a grocery store stark naked. Yup, full-frontal Kristen Wiig, y'all. This is not how I would choose to make my first big frontal if I were an actress. Tim Robbins makes a few appearances as her therapist, and he's likely the one character I enjoyed. But I still had to wonder, what therapist gives a patient his home address?

I still love Kristen Wiig. Skeleton Twins was fantastic. Bridesmaids made me laugh until I peed. And I can't wait to see the Ghostbusters remake. But this disc went in the trash.",1438041600,7,1854,4.528358208955224

A comment on one star rated reviews. I venture to guess that some, already emotionally hooked in self-aggrandizement talk shows, were affronted by the SNL style put-down portrayal of the talk show formula of selling oneself and/or stuff. Perhaps another percentage just didn't get the tragicomedy portrayal of those with a BPD emotional attachment to that tele formula format.

The only change I would have made in the script to improve accuracy would be to replace Oprah with Ellen Degeneres because her show more accurately reflects guests and host in the ""selling-themselves, self-promotion brand of narcissism"". And, The Ellen Show also excels in the other two ""We"" BPD categories of compensation consumption (buying to feel good) and embarrassing or putting others down to raise self-esteem.

7013297,3,B00TLXIQPI,"This is one weird movie. It's considered a dark comedy but in some ways, it's not. ""Welcome to Me"" is odd and slow-moving. I'm pretty much rating this movie 3 stars because of Kristen Wiig's performance. I think Kristen is a great, funny, fearless actress. She has wonderful, natural facial expressions and her comedic timing is absolute perfection. In ""Welcome to Me"", Kristen portrays Alice - a young woman suffering from borderline personality disorder. Alice lives alone and collects disability from the state, and pretty much spends her time obsessively watching Oprah reruns and playing the lottery hoping to strike it rich. Well, her persistence pays off and she ends up winning $86 million. Her life dramatically changes (naturally) and that is when things get really weird, plot-wise. I don't want to ruin the rest of the film but I felt like this film was ""making fun"" of mental illness. I'm sure it was unintentional but I just felt like the characterization of BPD wasn't accurate and a little mean-spirited. Kristen Wiig is riveting to watch even though Alice is so unlikeable, and the plot was so forced and wooden. I felt like ""Welcome to Me"" was trying way too hard to be ""edgy"" and ""cool"". There wasn't anything really funny about this film either. I didn't laugh once. I've just always liked Kristen Wiig and I think she did a commendable job. But I recommend a different Kristen Wiig movie, ""The Skeleton Twins"" - Now that's a great movie! It's a mixed bag for ""Welcome to Me"". So bizarre.",1434931200,,1508,4.803846153846154

However, as a sufferer of both borderline personality disorder and bipolar disorder, I felt almost offended watching this movie. It further stigmatizes and adds to the misrepresentation of people suffering from severe mental illness. We are mentally ill - not socially inept weirdos who are chronically awkward. Besides the crying and impulsive decisions, this was a completely inaccurate representation of BPD. Also, people who are commenting saying that she has bipolar disorder in the movie are wrong - she clearly states she has borderline personality disorder, which are different disorders, though they may often exist together.

I would love to see a film that accurately represents mental illness - in all its without portraying us as people unable to ""fit in"" and function like normal human beings.",1433808000,4,987,5.130434782608695

7013388,4,B00TLXIQPI,"Kristen Wiig is a terrific actress/comedienne, one of the most talented performers working today.  I would watch her in virtually anything.

In WELCOME TO ME, she plays a woman suffering from a bi-polar disorder who, while off her medication, wins the Mega-millions lottery.

So, what does she do with her newfound riches?

She buys herself her own television show in which she does whatever she wants.  Indeed, she broadcasts her dirty laundry as both a form of exhibitionism and a platform to share her offbeat views on everything from cooking to painful past relationships to neutering pets.

Directed by Shira Piven, WELCOME TO ME is being sold as a black comedy, but my problem with the film is that, aside from a couple of lines early on, the film is not funny.  Yes, at first glance, the premise seems amusing, as does the movies trailer, but this is really a tragic tale: the story of a badly disturbed woman who blows almost eighty-three million dollars to produce a vanity television series in which she bares her soul in public.  The people who run the television station are certainly aware that she is not right, yet they are more than willing to take her money.  And, I have to wonder why her friends and family didn't step in and force her to stop.

WELCOME TO ME is a well-made picture, but viewers expecting a laugh-out-loud comedy will be disappointed.

The film features a fine supporting cast: Wes Bentley, Linda Cardellini, Tim Robbins, Joan Cusack, James Marsden, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Thomas Mann.

The Blu-ray from Alchemy includes a Making of featurette.

7013389,4,B00TLXIQPI,"From the start, I'll say that this movie will likely not appeal to everyone and it stands a pretty good chance of offending at least one out of every five people that give it a shot. It is the story of a woman with personality disorders who wins a state lottery and then uses the money to produce and star in her own talk-show, with the weekly and eventually daily topic being 'her'. She picks the one struggling cable outlet with desperate producers, to write a big enough check for, that will lock her show in. Of course its a train-wreck from the start, but somehow the show, despite being a sad product of her own disorders,  ends up appealing to more people than anyone thought. In the process of her newfound stardom, coupled with the complexities of her disorders,  she begins to alienate those that genuinely love and care for her.

While ""Welcome to Me"" is funny at times, I never felt that it was making fun of people with mental disorders. It is far too easy to draw that conclusion, and I dare-say that most of the negativity will be expressed by people who will refuse to give the movie a chance; a fate similar to what happened with ""The Ringer,"" which was a far more sensitive movie about mental retardation than it could have been.

""Welcome to me"" is very sensitive to its subject and Wiig delivers a multi-dimensional Oscar-caliber performance. She is totally believable in this role. While ""Welcome to Me"" could have gone off the rails with stupidity and genuinely offensive humor, the integrity of the script, filmmakers and cast, makes it a refreshing and very sincere film. Those that refuse to give the movie a chance, based on what they 'think' they know about the film, will miss out. Please note that this film is not for children. This is an adult comedy with string adult themes and content throughout.",1432598400,4,1830,4.604294478527607
7013390,1,B00TLXIQPI,A lost opportunity.  The idea is an intriguing one: a woman locked into her own self-obsessions through borderline personality disorder wins the lottery and funds her own talk show. But the movie doesn't seem to know where to go with that. To focus on the bizarre quirky show becoming a cult hit because of its oddity? To use her show to satirize the narcissism of daytime talk shows and our self-help culture in general? To chart the character's struggle with mental illness as she learns to acknowledge and consider other people?  It touches on these themes but fails to develop any of them sufficiently so that the result is too much of her obsessed focus on herself.,1432598400,9,670,4.717948717948718

7013418,1,B00TLXIQPI,"Oh - my - goodness...what a terrible movie. Is it a comedy?  Is it a drama?  If it's a comedy, then I can't remember a movie made with poorer taste or less sensitivity to a troubling subject like mental illness. If it's a drama, it was so pointless and meandering that it makes ""Birdman"" look like genius.

The gratuitous sex scenes were so awful, gross, and again tasteless given that the aggressor was someone with mental illness off her meds, that the movie could have been unrateable.

Perhaps there's a movie within a movie here, with parallels to Wiig's personal life: she has won the lottery of fame and riches to an extant she can make whatever kind of movie she wants, and ends up making a really lousy, weird show that a few oddballs like.  I hope that the mental illness and loss of friends is not part of that parallel for her, but if I could get a refund for the hour and a half of my life I just wasted, I would take it.",1431734400,2,934,4.254237288135593

7013425,3,B00TLXIQPI,"As a new member of the rich and famous I simply don't have time for the pain. Alice (Wiig) is a socially awkward woman who sees a shrink and takes pills and watches Oprah in order to make it through the day. When she wins the lottery her life changes and she does the one thing she has always wanted to do, host a talk show. The show is all about her and she starts to air her dirty laundry to the world. When she goes too far things change for her again, but this time for the worse. Kristen Wiig has really started to find her own voice in movies. Moving away from the generic SNL skits she has chosen more intelligent comedies. Some of them have been hit or miss. This one, while a comedy still has the somewhat depressing ideas that she has become known for. All that said I will admit that I did like this and in terms of acting this is Wiigs best role to date. I think it is only a matter of time before she finds a part that will get her an Oscar nomination. As far as the movie goes I liked it, but its not for everyone. Overall, a funny and dark movie that I enjoyed but it defiantly not a main stream movie and will not be for everyone. I give it a B.",1431648000,4,1161,3.9446808510638296
7013426,5,B00TLXIQPI,"In their movie, Welcome to Me, Eliot Laurence and Shira Piven built what I consider to be dry, deliberate humor at its finest. Of course, the main reason to watch this film is Kristen Wiig's performance. This is the part she was meant to play, and she delivers at every stage in the movie.

As the story begins, the main character is a shy, neurotic individual. As such, Wiig's acting requires finesse and subtlety at that point. Not only does she pull it off splendidly, but I wonder if any other actor could have done it even half as well.

As the tale progresses, we watch Wiig's character (and subsequently, her acting) progress to something more outspoken and emotional. And yet, through it all, the humor remains so precise and utterly hilarious that looking away from the screen for even a moment can cause you to miss out on incredible laughs.

And to top it all off, this movie has a very solid story. It's full of emotion and uniquely broken characters who develop together toward a believable internal struggle and a positive climax.

Phenomenal.",1431648000,2,1057,4.697297297297298

Im somewhere in the middle on this one because I found it humorous, well acted and somewhat believable but at the same time the subject matter was off-putting.

I was skeptical at first that Kristen Wiig, one of my favorite comedians, would be able to pull off the leading role of Alice. I will not underestimate her again! The movie keeps the jokes and humor coming, even as Alice's life falls apart, even as she goes through the turmoil and drama that a realistic depiction of BPD demands. At the end of the day, you're really laughing with Alice, not at her. I think that's what makes the movie so compelling - it shows the humanity that struggles to find joy and humor in every situation, even when it's really not appropriate to be laughing. Especially then. Would recommend, but be warned, this movie isn't a light-hearted romp to throw on in a room of people you don't know. It's more of a ""let's get wine drunk and cry with my best friends"" type of movie.",1529539200,,979,4.4748603351955305
