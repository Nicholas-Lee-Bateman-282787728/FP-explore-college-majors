7904513,5,B000006IXV,"So much comes to mind when I think of THE SOUND OF MUSIC. It is jubilant, heartbreaking and ultimately uplifting to the spirit, this film demonstrates and is a tribute to all the goodness there is in the world and what life has to offer and what we can strive for. I saw this film when I was a little boy and well it was good I suppose but it has grown to mean much more to me with each passing year. There is goodness and love and tragedy in the world as I have now come to realize but when your spirits are low you can return to this film and remember and savor the lessons you have learned and reflect back and see parallels in the images that you once never truly saw. For a film that is greatness I suppose. Someone recently reintroduced me to this film and it has taken on a whole new meaning for me. Happiness is where you find it and make it. The one character that left an indelible image with me was Rolfe (Daniel Truhitte). Captain Von Trappe (Christopher Plummer) implores him to ""Come with us."" Rolfe had his chance to live life as a human being but he chose otherwise and in doing so gave up his chance for happiness. As a viewer, choose happiness and indulge yourself in this film. You will truly take away something of value each time you view it.

Such great talents are associated with this film. The prolific Robert Wise once again demonstrated his vast array of directorial talents (THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, EXECUTIVE SUITE, THE HAUNTING, WEST SIDE STORY, ODDS AGAINST TOMORROW, RUN SILENT, RUN DEEP) being able to produce yet another gem regardless of the genre. That is a rare thing and Wise certainly seemed like the man for that job on this film given his gentle demeanor and eye for good storytelling. Screenwriter Ernest Lehman is another prolific talent with screenplays for EXECUTIVE SUITE, SABRINA, NORTH BY NORTHWEST and THE KING AND I to his name. Production Designer Boris Leven also was another prolific fellow with production designs such as GIANT, JOHN PAUL JONES and WEST SIDE STORY to his name. The entire cast is excellent. Julie Andrew's nave yet intuitive qualities as Maria matched against the outwardly stern and overtly proud Christopher Plummer as Captain Von Trappe, who's personalities must eventually come together in order for them to become life loved partners is brilliantly performed by these two. Particular note should be made to Richard Hayden's performance as Max Detweiler Von Trappe's friend otherwise talent agent who acts as the liaison with the audience with his wry visual expressions.",1414972800,,2552,4.658536585365853
