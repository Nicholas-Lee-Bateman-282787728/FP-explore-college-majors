5473933,4,B00AQYUY24,"...for a low-budget cartoony horror adventure, along the lines of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fog-Special-Edition/dp/B00005JKG7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fog (Special Edition)</a>"". Like that film, 2012's ""Ghost Storm"" takes place on an island off the Northwest coast, involves a group of ghosts that can manifest as a creeping fog and an old priest. Other than these similarities the story's completely different. The menace here is in the form of a cloud or ""storm"" of ghosts, made-up mostly of recently slain (typically blown-up) victims.

Although the original ""The Fog"" (1980) created a nice creepy atmosphere, it always struck me as kind of boring (the '05 remake&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fog/dp/B000I9YUVS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fog</a>&nbsp;was more compelling IMHO). Although ""Ghost Storm"" lacks the big-budget finesse of these films, particularly the original, it makes up for it with more energetic storytelling and over-the-top death scenes. The downside to this is that it comes across as comic booky. Despite this, the actors and filmmakers deliver the goods with a straight face. So it might be cartoony, but it's not campy. Think 1972's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gargoyles/dp/B004S8UTII/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gargoyles</a>"" or 1987's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bay-Cove/dp/B00AXTJ7LQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bay Cove</a>"" and you'd have a good idea of the approach of ""Ghost Storm."" All three are comic book horror films made for television.

If you enter into ""Ghost Storm"" with this understanding you'll be able to enjoy it for what it is; if not, you won't. Since the CGI is cartoony and the death scenes are OTT they might elicit laughs from some viewers; so the movie can be enjoyed on this level as well. I was able to do the former and liked it enough when I saw it on TV last November that I decided to pick up the DVD the other day.

What made me like it enough to buy it on DVD? Other than the positives already noted, ""Ghost Storm"" has a quality cast, certainly better than the original ""The Fog."" The main protagonist is the sheriff of the island, played by the very likable Carlos Bernard. Then you have the sheriff's ex-wife, played by the striking Crystal Allen. Next you have their daughter, the beautiful Cindy Busby, and her cutie friend, Kacey Rohl. Lastly you have a paranormal investigator played by a guy who looks like a younger Brian Dennehy, Aaron Douglas.

I also really liked the love the protagonists show toward each other, particularly as the story proceeds. They're likable, worthy people and you find yourself rooting for them. There are also hints of forgiveness, acceptance and redemption.

BOTTOM LINE: ""Ghost Storm"" is nothing that'll blow you away; it's formulaic and hackneyed. But -- still -- it works for what it is. It takes elements of ""The Fog"" and creates a more snappy and cartoony micro-budgeted movie with a better cast.

Shot in the Vancouver area, the film runs about 90 minutes.

5473934,3,B00AQYUY24,"For those who watch SyFy movies because they are laughably bad, will surely find a friend in ""Ghost Storm"". The film starts out as it is going to be a fairly decent low budget horror production, but as 15 minutes becomes 30 minutes those hopes are smashed.

The story takes place on the NW island of Elman. The ghosts of 7 suicide victims (one only plays a role) are activated by a lightning strike and take the form of a cloud that flies around like something out of a Poltergeist sequel. The protagonists consist of Daisy (Cindy Busby) our mid twenty looking 17 year old girl. Her dad (Steve Bacic) who is the sheriff and is investigating the strange deaths. And her mom (Crystal Allen) is one of a pair of meteorologists who work on the island. Her parents are divorced.

We add to the mix a poorly developed paranormal investigator (Aaron Douglas) looking like a young Brian Dennehy, a priest, a curse, and an angry mob. The stories and characters are poorly developed. The dialouge started out good and then died as it turned corny.

I liked some of the more campy aspects of this film, including the ""shocking"" ending, Daisy spray foaming outlets, and the overkill of exploding bodies. I liked how the ghost took out the cell phone tower, but let the Internet intact...Daisy get off the computer mommy needs to use it. I was curious about the priests all having offspring, apparently not Catholic but some other domination that has stained glass windows. I was hoping for something similar to ""The Fog"" but that was not the case.

5473935,1,B00AQYUY24,"I made the mistake of renting this clunker. Talk about dumb! This is a bad rip-off of John Carpenter's The Fog. Startes out strong, but stupid and remains that way all the way through.
All in all, I can't recommend this clunker to anyone else. Save your time, effort and money on this one.",1366329600,3,289,4.37037037037037
5473936,2,B00AQYUY24,It was one of those movies that looked like it had a budget of a $1000 and didn't use it all.  It didn't even rank with the weird movies Sy-Fy channel runs.,1365033600,,156,3.875
5473937,2,B00AQYUY24,"Ghost Storm (TV 2011) is another derivation on John Carpenter's The Fog (1980).  Yet it lacks any interest whatsoever.  The special effects are horrible, the acting even worse.  There is no story to make a complete movie.  By the end you will be beating your head against a wall it is so dull and lifeless.  All it is is another ""Ghosts chasing people"" cheap TV flick.",1364428800,2,368,4.515151515151516

8556704,4,B00AQYUY24,"This movie opens in a cemetery......at night, during a storm.  Nothing good ever happens in a cemetery.  But these two couples are hoping to see lightning strike.  Why?  Because they are idiots.  On cue, lightning does indeed strike a humongous tomb stone reported to stand over the grave site of a mass suicide.  The stone splits, the earth cracks open, and a disk pops off (it's an amulet of sorts meant to keep the beleaguered spirits down).  One of the idiots decides to pee near the stone because that's what you do when you're in a cemetery at night and have no respect for the dead.  A sinister spiral of smoke pours forth from the crack in the earth aging him before his time.  Ah, sweet mystery of life, they soon have a body that saves them the problem of cremation by cremating itself.  And since this ominous cloud also has the properties of electricity, it isn't long before people are zapped left and right.  The bereaved father of the first victim soon turns into a dangerous vigilante with a posse of nitwits.  They think a sacrifice might help and the ex-wife (Crystal Allen) of the local constabulary (Carlos Bernard) looks to be a good choice.  Before you can sing Smoke Gets in Your Eyes (or batten down the hatches), all hell breaks loose, quickly decimating the populace of the tiny island.  Their only help appears to be an intense wacko (cigar man) claiming to be a paranormal investigator.  He is nothing if not a sage of bad advice and worthless solutions.  They are all doomed.  DOOMED!!!

This is one of those elemental horror movies that cobbles together bits and pieces of other horror movies because originality takes too much effort.

I kind of, sort of liked it.  But I had the advantage of already knowing it was crap before I bought it.",1428969600,2,1771,4.597444089456869
