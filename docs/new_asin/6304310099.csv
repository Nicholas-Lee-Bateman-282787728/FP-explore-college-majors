861460,5,6304310099,After reading Sounder with my students I decided to let them watch the movie.  This movie is wonderfully done and my students loved seeing the book come to life.  This is a great movie to add to your collection.,1000857600,8,211,4.384615384615385
861461,5,6304310099,"I saw this film on sale for about $3 at West Coast Video and had to pick it up, even though I only saw a few minutes on TBS one morning.  I usually don't watch G rated movies(as most of them are cartoons, which I don't care  much for) but this is one hell of a movie.  Like ""Babe,"" it's one  of those rare movies that can get its message across to adults without  talking down to them.
I do have one bone to pick with this film: the  graphic shooting of the dog.  This was a bit extreme, especially for a G  rated family-oriented picture.  If a 24 year old finds that scene  difficult, then it will surely scare the hell out of a tyke.  (Incidentally, both ""Babe"" films, especially the sequel, had some  very dark scenes.)  Regardless, the shooting is extremeley relevant to the  plot(cause Sounder helped them hunt).
I wish there were more films like  this.  I'm becoming real tired of shelling out $8 to see some lame sex  comedy or special effects dominated action film.",962409600,8,973,4.346368715083799

861783,5,6304310099,"I would strongly recommend Sounder because the text has a great theme, puts me in a fantastic mood, and the setting is important because the boy is trying and trying to get his father out of jail.
My first reason that I would recommend Sounder is the setting. One reason for the setting is in jail visiting the dad. My second reason is the dad is in jail because he stole ham for his family to eat. The dad stole the ham because his whole family is poor and doesnt have anything to eat.
My second reason that I would recommend Sounder  is mood, the story made me upset because if I was the boy I would be sad too, if I didn't have my dad to take care of me, and I know that they are in jail. The way the author made me feel sad is when the text said that the boy felt defeated.
Another great part of Sounder is the theme and the theme is to never give up on what you are doing. In the text the boy never gives up on getting his father out of jail.
This is my recommendation for sounder, the best story ever in the world. If you want to read the best story in the world then I would recommend Sounder.",1458086400,,1100,3.954954954954955

Sounder is a 1972 film based on William Armstrong's Newberry Medal winning novel, directed by Martin Ritt and starring Paul Winfield, Cicely Tyson and Kevin Hooks in the leading roles. The plot centers on a family of poor black farmers struggling to make ends meet in the Great Depression. The father is arrested for stealing a pig from another farm and sent to work in the quarries. The oldest son David is sent by his mother to find the camp and send word if the guards and policemen are treating him well. He finds the camp but is unable to locate his father so he goes home. On his way he meets an all-black school and makes friends with the teacher who offers to take him on as a student over the autumn. A few days after his return, his father is released from the prison because he broke his leg in a dynamite explosion. The father warns his son never to get in a fix like his--never to steal since the ends do not justify the means.  He and his wife agree to send David to the school and the film ends.
 Sure, the movie isn't without shortcomings. The shot composition is dull at times--there's not a lot of close up's like the master shot sequence where Nathan and his family and friends are coming home from the baseball game and talking. The beginning raccoon hunt and walk home from baseball could have stood to lose a couple minutes and the overall folksiness feel gets a little obnoxious and annoying sometimes.
But I feel like the REAL glories of the movie lie in the little things--the moments of humor and poignancy--how the Morgan family had such a strong sense of family and community--the wealthy white lady Mrs. Boatwright helping them find out about Nathan's sentence and how to get to the camp--Camille washing David's wounded hand--and of course Rebecca running down the road to her husband at the end--beautiful touching moments.
But my favorite part has to be when Mrs. Boatwright confronts the sheriff about not letting the Morgan family know where Nathan has been sent simply because...WELL YOU KNOW WHY. After he refuses and leaves his office she muses for a moment over her failure to keep her promise to David to find out about his father. But then suddenly she sees David at the door. He had followed her and overheard her conversation with the sheriff and she didn't even know it. One look on that little boy's face is enough for her--she is NOT going to give up THAT EASILY! So she digs through the files on the dresser! Go Granny go!
Paul Winfield and Kevin Hooks fit their roles like gloves as the father and son and Carmen Mathews' Mrs. Boatwright is a welcome presence but the real star of the show is Cicely Tyson's world weary Rebecca. The scene where she silently takes the storekeepers verbal crap holding it all in, resisting the temptation to snap back or slap him--cheering at him scoring a point in the baseball game--wonderful pieces of acting. And that scene where she runs down the road at the end to her husband is absolutely gut wrenching.
Also the cinematography has some very beautiful shots of Louisiana and the costumes and sets are as gritty and realistic as you can get.

I recommend this film. Sure, it doesn't reach the level of Martin Ritt's Hud but it is still a good example of his craft and is well worth watching.",1409097600,,3504,4.672609400324149

As such, some people criticize it as slow, which it is, but that's because it's a rural family DRAMA.

862387,5,6304310099,"This is not only an outstanding examination of the black experience in the Depression Era deep South, it is also a fine family experience and a great coming of age story. The film garnered four Oscar nominations, including best actor and actress nominations for Paul Winfield and Cicely Tyson as the father and mother of the black sharecropper family. They both perform masterfully...Tyson almost always does and this is a career-defining performance for Winfield. The other lead is played by child actor, Kevin Hooks, in his first theatrical role. He plays way beyond his years as the child who holds the family together when the father serves time for stealing food from a neighboring farmer.

""Sounder"" is the name of the dog that belongs to a family of sharecroppers; the family pet being closest to David, the eldest son. Times are very hard in the South. Racism runs rampant and completely unchecked. The summer weather is particularly hot and humid. Food is scarce. After a night of chasing a racoon through miles of woods, father and son return to the windowless shack empty-handed. The next morning, however, there is fresh meat frying in the pan... Shortly, the father is arrested for stealing a ham from his employers store, and is given a harsh sentence of one year of hard labor. 13-year old David is now the man of the house, but he is torn between helping his mother turn a profit from their sugar cane harvest, or by attending school. The adventure takes off from this point and the story that unfolds is truly unforgettable. My only hope is that this film will get a Blu-Ray release someday...",1344643200,,1111,4.731958762886598

862471,4,6304310099,"I didn't really know what to expect from `Sounder'.  When I realized, within the first few minutes, that Sounder was the name of the dog I got a little afraid that this was going to turn into one of those Disney films that revolves around a special pooch, but thankfully this film really doesn't concern itself with the dog.  I haven't read the book it was adapted from, so I'm sure the direction that book took or if the dog had a more central role, but I'm happy that this film seemed to be more concerned with the human element than the canine one.

That said, overall I'm pretty happy with this film.  I wasn't completely won over with certain aspects of the film, but I'll spend my review focusing on the positive.

I am a big fan of `Hud', and what I loved so much about that films gritty detail I also love about this film.  Martin Ritt has a way with creating a realistic portrayal of life without playing to close to sympathies.  There are no forced emotions here.  Even when someone is doing something beautifully sympathetic (as in Mrs. Boatwright's attempts to help the Morgan family) it is approached in a way that feels authentic.  Sure, our heartstrings are swelling but not in that schmaltzy, saccharine kind of way.  This atmosphere is helped by the script, which thankfully strays away from being too melodramatic.  There is hardship and there is injustice, but it is handled appropriately, with the right amount of distance to create something objective.  The script isn't perfect (I did find that the white characters tended to become stereotypical caricatures) but overall it displayed more good than bad.

The acting for the most part was very impressive.  Kevin Hooks (the films only TRUE lead) is rather remarkable here.  Sadly, he is the only child actor who nails it for me.  The other child performances here are stiff and disappointing.  Cicely Tyson and Paul Winfield were astonishingly good.  I would have placed them both in supporting categories (where Tyson would have won for me) but I'm happy that they received Oscar nominations none-the-less.  Tyson especially is remarkable here.  She completely understands how to use subtlety to leave a devastating impact.

In the end I totally recommend this film.  I give it a solid B+.  It has a lot going for it, and while I feel that some things could have been shifted to attain a more well rounded and lasting feel, there really isn't a whole lot to be disappointed with here.",1275004800,,2457,4.715962441314554

862553,5,6304310099,"Martin Ritt's SOUNDER (1972) is set in the depths of the Great Depression. Here, the peacefulness of rural Louisiana belies a story of desperate lives.

A family of black sharecroppers nearly starves during each long winter. They fall in debt to the farmer/store owner then work his fields for an entire growing season not to get ahead, but just to pay back what is owed. It's a circle that seemingly can't be broken.

After a raccoon escapes him during a night hunt and not sure how to feed his hungry family, Nathan Lee Morgan (Paul Winfield) steals some ham from his employer. He's immediately arrested.

The family's hound, Sounder (the best huntin' dog there is) bays while Nathan Lee is being taken away in the back of an open truck. A cruel guard sprays the dog's face and right shoulder with rifle shot and the wounded yelping animal runs off into some woods, perhaps to die.

Once Nathan is convicted and sentenced, his wife (Cicely Tyson) isn't told to which prison farm he's being sent. She and her three children must work the crops alone this spring.

Later, on a lead from a kindly white lady the oldest Morgan boy, David Lee (Kevin Hooks) goes in search of his daddy. What he finds instead is a possible way to escape a hopeless existence.

It's a poignant story --painful even-- yet throughout, the perseverance of the human spirit as well as unshakable familial love is as palpable as the blazing heat and stifling humidity of a breezeless Louisiana August afternoon.

862629,5,6304310099,"A simple tale, simply told with great heart and soul for the main family headed by Cicely Tyson and Paul Winfield, who made names for themselves in this movie (Oscar nominations). Pity, neither were really rewarded with subsequent roles that acknowledge their efforts in this movie, with the exception of Tyson's tour de force in ""The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman."" This movie tells the tale of a family's struggle in sharecropping, partcularly after the father (Winfield) is jailed for stealing food to feed his family after a failed hunt towards that end. Ensuing endeavors include his family's efforts to meet the demands of their sharecropping while their father's in jail, the eldest son's (Kevin Hooks) journey to visit his dad in jail and his difficulties in obtaining knowledge of his whereabouts, and that son's ultimate first dealing with a mature decision when having to choose between accepting an invitation to attain an education at a school he encounters in his journey to find his father, or to stay home with the dad he's missed so much. The greatest injustice to this movie is that it came out the same year as ""The Godfather"" and ""Cabaret"", two movies that swept the Oscars that year denying ""Sounder"" any richly deserved praise by Hollywood. That aside, this is a great family film that will affect members of all ages.",1153958400,,1345,4.929515418502203
862630,5,6304310099,"There is a viscerally powerful moment in this 1972 film classic that still gets to me. It's the look of desperately aching relief on Rebecca Morgan's face and the palpable sound of her breathless anticipation as she runs down the long dirt road to embrace her husband Nathan Lee for the first time since he went to prison. I almost get as tear-drenched as she does. Whether tenaciously holding her family together or dealing cautiously with the powerful white community, Cicely Tyson plays Rebecca with a searing combination of emotional eloquence and subtle nuance. Yet, her performance is not the dominant factor of the film, as director Martin Ritt, a specialist in human dramas set in the South, has directed a wondrous ensemble piece focused on a family of black sharecroppers in Depression-era Louisiana. Based on a children's book by William H. Armstrong and adapted by Lonne Elder III, the movie is blissfully free of stereotypes or dramatic manipulation.

The plot is compact. Nathan Lee takes his son David Lee raccoon hunting with their aptly named dog, Sounder (he howls when he sees them). The family hits particularly hard times when Nathan Lee steals a ham for his family and is carted off to a prison camp for a year. David Lee sets out to find him and happens upon a school run by Camille, a kindly but firm teacher. She teaches him about important African-American figures in history, and he becomes desperate to go to school. David Lee returns home, and soon after, a maimed Nathan Lee returns as well. Not wanting to take advantage of Camille's offer to stay with her to go to school, David Lee is convinced by his father that school is the only thing he should pursue.

It is a rare thing, a family drama that does not patronize to its audience and remains compelling to adults, and it is especially shameful that the film rarely resurfaces for new generations to enjoy. Beyond Tyson, Paul Winfield is equally affecting as Nathan Lee, and in the pivotal role of David Lee, Kevin Hooks (now a successful TV director) brings strength to his plaintive performance. Effective in smaller roles are blues musician Taj Mahal as family friend Ike (he also provides the evocative period music), Carmen Mathews as the conflicted Mrs. Boatwright and Janet MacLachlan as Camille. Intriguingly, Hooks directed a 2003 Disney remake and cast Winfield as the teacher in his last role before his death. In need of a makeover and a treatment deserving of the film's quality, the 2002 DVD has a decent though not outstanding print transfer and a bare minimum of extras (photo galleries, cast biographies).",1148947200,,2607,4.856179775280899
862631,3,6304310099,"One of my all-time favorite films, Cicely Tyson's performance was worthy of an Oscar. Though she didn't win. Her running to greet the return of her husband Nathan(Paul Winfeld)just released from prison, still stands out as a great cinematic moment.

A moving and sensitive portrayal of a black sharecropping family in the 1930s south, this Academy Award nominated film of 1972, deserves far better than this poor DVD offering. The film easily rates 5 stars, but the DVD is about the quality of 1. Shame on 20th Century-Fox for leaving this classic in the hands of an independent. And how can anyone complain about the director Martin Ritt?(Hud, The Great White Hope, Conrack, Norma Rae, Cross Creek)just to name a few.

A beautiful story, acted and directed with a 1930s down home feel, the only problem with this movie is the poor transfer onto DVD. I would say wait until 20th Century-Fox finally does it justice, with its own high quality DVD release; but that may never happen. So for now, we're stuck.

When I saw this move in the store, I had never heard of it. When I read the synopsis, seen that it was nominated for four Academy Awards and had Cicely Tyson staring in it, I felt I had to see it. Boy, what a let down!
I think the story would have been better had there been a decent director. The acting is awful, (with exception to Mrs. Tyson,) The video quality and sound is terrible. There was one scene where I actually cried. Not because the movie was touching, but because of the horrible acting. It was dreadful and I knew I had wasted my money.
Maybe with a better director, a few more actors and actresses like Mrs. Tyson, and a bigger budget, 'Sounder' could have been a decent movie to watch/buy, but sadly, I found out too late it had none of these things.",1033257600,11,1383,4.262357414448669
862636,5,6304310099,"""Sounder"" is a film of sublime beauty- one of the most powerful films for anyone to see. Even though the title made no immediate sense to me (it's the name of the family dog), the plot and script is choice and proves what I've always believed regarding most scripts: less is more. Films which feature close, reverent African-American families are still rare in the 21st century, and this was a *1972* release- which broke ground when it was nominated at that year's Academy Awards for lead actor (Paul Winfield), lead actress (Cicely Tyson), screenplay (Lonne Elder III), and best picture. Only director Martin Ritt was not nominated- which was a travesty, but the Academy is historically famous for bonehead decisions. At any rate, I was happy to see a film which shows family supporting each other- even in the event of the father's absence. I won't say why that happens, but it's only temporary, and his third act return- staged against a long stretch of open farm field and spotlighting a barefoot Tyson and limping Winfield running into each other's arms- is a bewitching, magical, sequence in the film. Everyone is a standout, including Kevin Hooks's pre-teen who needs to grow up overnight and to Carmen Matthews as the neighbor who supports and tries to help the family. Even more amazing is that this is a G-rated film; your whole family- black, white, or brown- will absolutely cherish it.
