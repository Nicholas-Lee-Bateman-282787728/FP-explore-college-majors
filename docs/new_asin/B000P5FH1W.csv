2811811,4,B000P5FH1W,"This splashy Cinemascope feature about the Stanford White-Evelyn Nesbitt-Harry K. Thaw affair has alot to recommend.  An intriguing script co-written by Billy Wilder's longtime collaborator, Charles Brackett.  The film looks great with sumptuous art direction and costume design and an excellent use of color.  Ray Milland is solid as famed architect White.  I don't think Milland was capable of a bad performance even in the B-Movie fodder he later toiled in.  The real eye opener is Joan Collins who many would dismiss as a second tier Liz Taylor.  Her role here requires her to go from a wide-eyed artist's model to a spurned wife of a murderous industrialist and she rises to the challenge.  I dock the film a star because I found Farley Granger's Thaw a tad wooden.  The direction by Richard Fleischer also meanders at times.  If this film were directed by somebody other than the journeyman Fleischer it may have made more of a visceral impact.  Instead it's an above average period piece that showcases an up and coming starlet.",1186444800,4,1035,4.930635838150289
2811812,3,B000P5FH1W,"One of Farley Granger's best performances highlights this period drama of the Evelyn Nesbit/Harry K. Thaw/Stanford White love and murder triangle. It was an early Cinemascope picture, full of vivid color; i hope the product description is in error when it says they've released it in full screen. If so, don't waste your money; it shows in a letterboxed version of the Fox Movie channel - watch that instead. Otherwise, an interesting, neglected film.",1184457600,14,451,5.108108108108108
2811813,4,B000P5FH1W,"Like a lot of people I first learned the story of Evelyn Nesbit from the movie version of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ragtime/dp/B0002WZTO8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ragtime</a>,"" because I did not read ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ragtime/dp/0812978188/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ragtime</a>"" the novel.  However, when it comes to calling Nesbitt ""The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing,"" that is something that I associate with ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ragtime-The-Musical/dp/B0000064XS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ragtime - The Musical</a>.""  A century later we look back at Nesbit as having been at the heart of what is clearly the first ""trial of the century,"" and can trace a clear line from it through the Scopes Trial, the Lindbergh baby case, the O.J. Simpson trial and a host of others.  Nesbit was married to Harry K. Thaw, a rich playboy who had become infamous for such antics as riding a horse up the steps of an exclusive New York club.  But Thaw was obsessed by the fact that Evelyn had once had an affair with Stanford White, the most prominent architect in the country.  On June 25, 1906, convinced that White was still after Evelyn, Thaw shot White dead in the roof-garden theater at Madison Square Garden.  This was the most notorious murder case of that ear with the public eagerly following it in both the ""yellow"" press and the more reputable newspapers.  Nesbit was considered the most beautiful woman in America during the trial and ironically it was a photograph of her that served as the inspiration for Lucy Maud Montgomery's description of her famous literary creation,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Anne-of-Green-Gables/dp/0451528824/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Anne of Green Gables</a>.

Nesbit herself served as a consultant on the 1955 film, ""The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing,"" which is probably of more interest today because Nesbit is played by a young Joan Collins.  Ray Milland plays Stanford White while Farley Granger plays Harry K. Thaw, and even though she is turning in an extremely restrained and subtle performance Collins stands out because the two male leads are even more constrained, whether by the class considerations of their characters or the limitations of their acting ability is debatable.  You understand what White and Thaw see in Evelyn, but beyond their money there is not much to recommend either of them to the young girl and when she allows herself to be seduced by White you cannot help but think that it is happening because historically it is true and because the script says it does.  Milland is rather bland, but at least Granger does a good job of convincing us that his character is dangerously deranged, regardless of what any court of law might rule at this trial.

The production values of director Richard Fleischer's film are what make it easier to round up on this one in the end what with the art direction, set decoration, and costumes are taking advantage of the upper crust circles in which the characters lived.  I also think the glitz allows the film to get away with more direct allusions to sex than you usually see in films from this period (tastefully done off camera, of course).  Still, watching this movie is a bit strange because not only is it  a quarter-century before ""Dynasty"" makes Joan Collins a household name, but it is also a decade before her memorable appearing in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-City-on-the-Edge-of-Forever/dp/6305910529/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The City on the Edge of Forever</a>"" on the original ""Star Trek.""  If you did not know this was Joan Collins I do not know if you guess just by looking at her.  However, in the end this film fails to provoke a significant response, either emotionally or intellectually, to the sight of Evelyn in the red velvet swing

In 1907 Nesbit had appeared as herself in a dramatization of the shooting entitled ""The Unwritten Law: A Thrilling Drama Based on the Thaw-White Tragedy,"" and made several silent films between 1914 and 1922.  Decades later Collins had come to the attention of Hollywood in the 1955 Howard Hawks film ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Land-of-the-Pharaohs/dp/B000OHZJIW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Land of the Pharaohs</a>,"" and instead of making B-movies in England she was signed by Fox to be their studio's answer to Elizabeth Taylor.  After ""The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing"" she would star in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sea-Wife/dp/B000P6XPXI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sea Wife</a>"" (1957) opposite Richard Burton, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stopover-Tokyo/dp/B000P6XPY2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stopover Tokyo</a>"" (1957) starring Robert Wagner, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rally-Round-the-Flag-Boys/dp/B000P6XPX8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rally 'Round the Flag, Boys!</a>"" (1958) with Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward, and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Seven-Thieves/dp/B000P6XPXS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Seven Thieves</a>"" (1960) with Edward G. Robinson and Rod Steiger.  Whether your are talking about Evelyn Nesbit or Joan Collins, the reason for seeing ""The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing"" is going to be because of historical interests rather than anything else.  But why is she ""in"" the red velvet swing rather than ""on"" it?  That was my big question at the end of this film.",1184025600,21,5695,6.126884422110553

I then learned of a connection to my adopted home in New Hampshire and that led to reading anything I could find about Evelyn Nesbit. I love this movie still, even though it barely scratches the surface of the Harry Thaw part of the story.",1443744000,,382,4.2465753424657535
2811817,5,B000P5FH1W,Great movie!,1441065600,,12,5.5
2811818,3,B000P5FH1W,"This is the first time I have ever seen this movie. I have read many books about the case, including Harry Thaw's book (out of print) and biographies of Stanford White as well as Evelyn's own memoirs, and many books about her as well. I am also surprised that Evelyn gave the green light to this script, but she did change her story a few times over the years; sometimes she would recall knowing Stanford White as the most important and inspiring thing that ever happened to her and sometimes she portrayed herself as an innocent girl he used and abandoned. This says to me she did have feelings for him at one time even if they were just based on the glamour and excitement he made her feel when she was with him. She was so young at the time she wouldn't have known the difference. Being taken up by him would have been like opening a door into a new world.

And her choice of Harry as a husband, a man with a known obsession against White for other reasons than Evelyn was an attempt at revenge at being dropped. I believe White was genuinely fond of Evelyn but there were so MANY new girls all the time in those circles he moved in that they were not taken at all seriously by the men. He also would not have been married to another woman besides Bessie; his family was important to him and he really led several lives. As for Harry K. Thaw (of Pittsburgh!) he was a nutcase and did dreadful things to domestic servants and to women including his wife. His mother was formidable although Evelyn did live with the Thaws for a time after their marriage and attempt to get along with her, (and Mrs. Thaw, according to one account, told Harry if he ever hit Evelyn again she'd cut him off without a penny), but Mrs. Thaw in the end lived only for her son, and it was her money. She tricked Evelyn both at the time over the testimony and the money in the divorce and support for Evelyn's son by Harry. After the divorce, Evelyn  was constantly having to write letters to remind Harry to pay up, etc. Her own mother didn't want anything to do with her and had married again. But Evelyn was tough and she made her own way and there was something about her as even when she was old, men would say she was the most attractive woman they'd ever met.  She's an interesting character because she's a woman who sort of forged her own path at a time when it really was not done. Many highs and deep lows. A survivor.

The only real facts in the movie are: the flat above the toyshop (F.A.O. Schwartz - I would have thought it would be fancier); the swing; the fixed tooth, the sending to Miss de Mille's School, many of her outfits and costumes, and that Harry Thaw shot Stanford White on the rooftop of MSG during the opening performance of Mlle Champagne. And that Harry was sent to Matteawan after the first trial. I wish they had at least put a mustache on Ray Milland. But I enjoyed seeing it. It was a good effort and Miss Collins looked beautiful.

Also these big studio productions from this era do tend to whitewash things, as far as manners go, I'm torn as to whether, being closer in time so there were probably people around the place, including Evelyn herself, who would have known how people actually behaved in 1906, it is more accurate in social portrayals than later re-tellings, or if contemporary censors controlled that. Though most researchers depict White as a kind of loud and energetic guy rather than a gentleman of means. I thought Farley Granger was a very good Thaw, he doesn't look like him but he gave the impression of him. Supporting cast was stellar.",1436054400,4,3573,4.383107088989442

2811829,2,B000P5FH1W,"My expectations were high for this film because I had read a lot about the true story it was based on and the events were so fascinating. However, I didn't think this film was very well produced and I noticed many significant inaccuracies. I think one problem was the fact that it was made in the early fifties when so much of the shocking and salacious subject matter had to be left out. But I don't think it's possible to skirt around those elements when they are so important to the story.

2811830,4,B000P5FH1W,"This movie again did not hold to the truth. I read everything I could get my eyes on about Stanford White, Evelyn Nesbit, and Harry K. Thaw and it was just a lot of fiction. The only thing parts were the murder, the red velvet swing and a few other details. It was done well however and the acting was decent. I liked Joan Collins as Evelyn. But the real EN has red hair and she wasn't thin. She was pudgy, she was only 15 at the time of the seduction and Stanny was over-weight and not at all good looking like Ray Milland. It was a mis-casted for Stanny White. If this murder interests you, read the internet sites on Evelyn Nesbit and Harry K. Thaw. There is much written about them all. Tons of things to research. It was a killing in cold blood and Harry got away with it due to news publicity and bribery on the part of the his Mother Mrs. Thaw. She wouldn't let justice be done. She bought him his ticket to freedom and he lived a life of drugs, sex and debauchery for many years after he killed Stanford.

2811832,4,B000P5FH1W,"I was vaguely aware of this incident since Harry K. Thaw was from my city; but I didn't know the details until I saw this film which was more than interesting.  The extremely beautiful Evelyn Nesbitt, a Broadway show girl and an original Gibson Girl whose portrait graced many a magazine cover was the spark that lit the fuse in Harry K. Thaw, causing him to murder Stanford White in the rooftop restaurant/theater of Madison Square Gardens in 1906.  After watching this film most excellently acted by Ray Miland, Joan Collins, and Farley Granger, I did my own research into those three volatile characters and found this film not far from the mark.
The acting was more than decent with each character adequately developed in their own twisted way.  The story is so strange as to be nearly unbelievable but at the same time oh so true.  No writer could have imagined a story like this one and expect the audience to believe it. Rest assured the story is true. You can do your own research of the facts.  I highly recommend this film as a good starting point for more research into those three basically self-centered people who caused so much heartache that led to the death of Stanford White.",1365120000,,1193,4.6350710900473935

2811835,4,B000P5FH1W,"Before I write my entire review, I must admit that I am a huge fan of Joan Collins! ""The Girl in the Red Velvet"" (1955) was Collins's star turn. However, the film was only given to her after Marilyn Monroe (in which I am a HUGE fan of) turned it down. Before filming began the studio (20th Century-Fox) signed Collins to a long-term contract and cast her in the film as a last minute replacement for Monroe.

On the basis of the film, I give it an A-Grade and four stars. The stunningly beautiful costumes worn by the women in this film are superb! The picture quality gets a 100% grading along with sound around 95%. The reasoning for the sound ranking lower is because, sometimes the sound sounds as if it was coming out just one side of your TV and if you don't listen carefully or have the volume up loud enough, you just might miss a thing or two! All and all this film is superb, Joan Collins looks beautifully, along with Ray Milland and Farley Granger who lend support to her. Yes, Miss Collins is the star of the star of this picutre, not Ray Milland or Farley Granger. It's devastating to me that this lavishly produced CinemaScope produced/DeLuxe colored Fox spectacular only made $1.3 million in the United States upon it's original release.

For the remaining questions, I must say that the four stars are four the performances of the three leads, the sets, the costumes. But as I must admit, which may be diffencive to some: Yes, the film would've been better with Marilyn Monroe! But DON'T ignore this film just because she isn't in it! This is a totally neglected film from Hollywood's classical film area. I guarentee your purcahse want be disappointing.",1343088000,,1671,4.566666666666666
2811836,1,B000P5FH1W,"There are times when movie directors take a good plot line and try to make it overly dramatic by slowing down the pace between events to the extreme and by highlighting things that are best left emphasized naturally.  This film is a prime example of such a case.  The story itself of Evelyn Nesbit is a compelling one, but this film bores one to tears.  The only reason we finished it is to see how it all worked out in the end.  The young Joan Collins is charming.  And the aging Ray Milland is a sympathetic character, which actually works to the detriment of the film.  As one could be more involved with the story line if the character of Frank White were not so likeable in the form of Ray Milland.  If one isn't familiar with the story of Evelyn Nesbit, who was the inspiration for the face of Anne in Anne of Green Gables as per Lucy Maud Montgomery's diary, this movie serves as a good introduction.  But as far as the movie itself is concerned, it isn't worth neither the time nor the money.",1336608000,,1000,4.310160427807487

Good grief Evelyn!  They changed the facts of the story to Evelyn seducing Stanford White!  For godsake, he raped her when she was 16 yr old and passed out from drinking champagne.  This movie has him as the victim!

And the movie portrays her mother, and mother-in-law as being kindly women.  In reality, her mother through parental neglect (and being financially subsidized by White) allowed White the opportunity to rape Evelyn, and Mrs. Thaw hated Evelyn all of her life.

All we are told is that Harry Thaw was crazy, Stanford White was sort of an innocent victim, and Evelyn Nesbit was pretty.  It wasn't enough.

The murder of White is, in my view, the most interesting crime of the 20th century, and this movie turns it into just another killing.  The true story had everything:  a gorgeous girl, raw sex, lechery, madness, wealth, and jealousy.  There are several good books on the subject, and at least one other movie does a better job of telling the story.

As for acting, Joan Collins couldn't and the others didn't.  The sets and Cinemascope photography are lush, but they don't make up for the acting and directing flaws.",1220832000,4,875,4.528662420382165
2811841,4,B000P5FH1W,"This is a discovery for me. Because of the sensational nature of the case (New York architect Stanford White shot by the husband of White's ex-mistress in 1904), combined with the publicity surrounding Joan Collins,
the quality of the film was overlooked at the time of its release. In fact it is a beautifully made period piece with very good performances. Farley Granger is surprisingly good as the unstable Harry Thaw and there are great supporting actors like Glenda Farrell and Luther Adler. Even Joan Collins is quite adequate in the role of the title role.",1212537600,,563,4.875
2811842,4,B000P5FH1W,"Ripped from a turn-of-the-century scandal, THE GIRL IN THE RED VELVET SWING is a fascinating movie starring Joan Collins as Evelyn Nesbit, the young showgirl who found herself at the center of the infamous Thaw/White murder trial.

Evelyn Nesbit (Joan Collins) achieves nationwide fame posing for Charles Dana Gibson (Richard Travis), and later becomes romantically linked with famous architect Stanford White (Ray Milland).  Unwilling to create a scandal by divorcing his wife, Stanford instead enrols Evelyn in an exclusive boarding school where Evelyn, heartbroken, suffers a nervous breakdown.

Salvation comes in the form of millionaire playboy Harry Kendall-Thaw (Farley Granger).  Seeing no other option, Evelyn reluctantly marries him; but his vicious imagination still believes White to be a competitor for Evelyn's love.  Their violent relationship comes to a shocking climax when Thaw murders White on the rooftop of Madison Square Garden; Evelyn is then forced to endure a humiliating trial where her personal character is dragged through the mud.

THE GIRL IN THE RED VELVET SWING was originally slated as a musical entitled ""The Girl in Pink Tights"" and was to have starred Marilyn Monroe as Evelyn Nesbit.  When Monroe's casting proved impossible, the premise of the film was changed to a crime drama and Fox starlet Joan Collins landed the plum lead role.  Ray Milland offers a keenly-felt performance as Evelyn's fatherly lover White, and shares a great chemistry with Collins.  Farley Granger was fabulous at playing unhinged brooding types, and his performance as Thaw is fascinating to watch.  The strong cast also includes Cornelia Otis-Skinner, Gale Robbins, Luther Adler and Glenda Farrell.  The Edwardian costume and set designs look lush in CinemaScope.

THE GIRL IN THE RED VELVET SWING, once one of the rarest movies you could find on home video or cable, looks simply sensational on DVD.  Extra features include scene-specific (and virtually non-existent) audio commentary with film historian Aubrey Solomon, image galleries, restoration comparison, and the trailer.

It contains a stereo track that is nice but usually FOX gives these releases the original mono track. Maybe they had to upgrade it due to poor quality of the surviving mono track MAybe? FOX should have had a bonus feature explaining this if it is the case. This is a rare film that now you an buy isn't but it is a classic and is better than I expected.

8189135,2,B000P5FH1W,"This movie doesn't seem anything like the real story I've heard of Evelyn Nesbit. Farley Granger is great as a neurotic husband, and it was refreshing to see Joan Collins not speaking in that clipped accent of hers.",1505433600,,215,4.684210526315789
8189136,3,B000P5FH1W,"Didn't Finish Viewing, but was a Good Film so far. Instead of Renting it again, I may consider Purchasing it. That s is a Fictionalized Account of the True Crime Scandal, but because of the Nature of the Crime and Reason, the Story is about as Sanitized as it could get. I would like to finally see this Story told as it was. Technicolor and Beautiful Costumes. Joan Collins Stars as the Showgirl/Artist's Model Evelyn Nesbit, but it's Marilyn Monroe with a Black Wig on the Cover Poster.
It would have been some Film with Ms. Monroe as Lead.",1505088000,,542,4.484848484848484

8189138,4,B000P5FH1W,"The mail delivery was swift.  As a movie overall, boring.  I bought this mainly because Cornelia Otis Skinner appears as the mother of Harry Thaw.  Because she was primarily a stage actress (and a darn good one at that), she appears in only four motion pictures.  She was better known to audiences born before 1950....the only daughter of two well-known stage actors, she was also a proficient author, with one of her books on the NYT Best Seller list for a couple of weeks.  She was about 6' foot....about 5 inches shorter and she probably would have gone farther.",1485734400,,565,4.666666666666667

8189141,4,B000P5FH1W,"Having recently read the book, American Eve, I wanted to see if the movie matched the book's portrayal of this tragic, turn of the century love triangle between the hauntingly beautiful Evelyn Nesbit, lecherous Stanford White, and the unhinged maniac she marries, Harry Thaw.  Even though Nesbit herself was a consultant on the movie, it differs from the book dramatically.  The book more accurately conveys White as a predator who uses his name, age, and position in society to charm and fool the very young and unsophisticated Evelyn into becoming his teenage mistress. It differs from the movie, which practically paints Evelyn as a willing, lovestruck seductress, eager to entice a reluctant, guilt-ridden White into an illicit, ill-fated love affair with her.  That said, Joan Collins is beautiful as Evelyn, and the movie is well-acted and written.",1466294400,4,854,5.218978102189781

8189143,4,B000P5FH1W,"Joan Collins is superb. It's a shame her film career never took off to greater heights following this movie.  If Elizabeth Taylor hadn't preceded her, she may have been offered some of Taylor's glamour girl roles like ""Cleopatra,"" ""The V.I.P.'s,"" and ""Butterfield 8."" Thankfully, her portrayal of Alexis Carrington in ""Dynasty"" more than two decades later marked her return to stardom.",1453593600,,385,5.311475409836065
