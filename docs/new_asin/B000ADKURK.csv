8626404,2,B000ADKURK,"I suspect the instructor in this video means well.  He's just not that helpful.  I did pick up a couple of licks off of it though.  But it was not worth $24 by any stretch of the imagination.

The first part of the video talks about damping, and right hand technique.  This information can be found for free on many websites in greater detail.  I was hoping for some insight into how to be more functional playing slide in standard tuning (not to learn how to get started with slide guitar).

The second half is mildly helpful.  Standard tuning is pretty limiting to a slide player, but my brain is not yet ready to keep track of two different fret boards (open tunings). This video is not much help, and unless you are ok with getting a pretty limited return on your investment, I would steer clear.  I'm not sure that I totally regret it.  But when it was over, I was thinking that the video was kind of a joke. I guess I'll go back an look at it again in a few days.  I'm pretty hard up for some instruction.  There doesn't seem to be much help out there for standard tuning.  Maybe I'll stalk Warren Haynes.",1357862400,2,1111,4.258373205741627
