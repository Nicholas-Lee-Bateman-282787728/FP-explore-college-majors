8627484,1,B00GTSVPC4,"This is a collection of some of the works of Jason Impey. I imagine that ""The Worst of Jason Impey""  wouldn't market well. The first couple of films are snuff films which Jason claims are real and ""I don't hold back.""  Examples of this would be you see a butter knife going after a guy. Said guy on the ground with blood. Butter knife covered with butter. One film showed a man being ""kicked"" with phantom kicks that could only strike Sonny Liston. People who were really killed in one snuff film show up in another film...living in the same flat. Plot and character is not in Impey's vocabulary. The acting was worse.

One the plus side the techno dance sound track used continuously looped in the first film could be played a dance club, even with the occasional bit of dialogue. Could be viewed as extreme camp value, but I have no idea what type of substance would make these films entertaining.

The description used to describe one Impey film is used to describe them all. For instant this DVD has nothing close to a rape scene, yet the description claims there is one.

Guide: F-bomb, BBW nudity.",1444867200,2,1103,4.522613065326633
8627485,2,B00GTSVPC4,"I hate to leave negative reviews. Being a film maker myself I know the pains of working on a micro budget. The filmmakers who made this film made one of my favorite indy horror exploitations films ""Psychopaths"". So I had high hopes for this one. But sadly I was disappointed. This film was not as described. ""Rape, Torture, Murder"" was not no where to be found in this collection. There was some good death scenes, and some very beautiful ladies in those scenes, but there was no story, no character development, no nothing really. Just a guy going from house to house or field to field killing random people who have no idea why they are even there. Unrated?? No need for that, this thing could be rated PG if it weren't for a few misleading moments. Three scenes with women drawing a bath and then get drowned in the bath water? The killer could have at least waited until they got undressed first. I am going to assume that Jason Impey had no money to pay anyone so they couldn't really do anything. I do believe Jason Impey has talent, after all he did make one of my favorite films but this was obviously some of his first works and should have just stated that from the get go. Leave out the Unrated crap, leave out the misleading descriptions, just say hey this was the first films made by Jason Impey, creator of ""Psychopaths"" and ""Snuff"". And leave it at that. Sure sales wouldn't be as high, but you also would leave out bad reviews such as this one, and possibly avoid losing any future sales from fans like me. Even though I like his work I would be a bit leary about buying anything with his name on it in the future if this is what they are going to put out. So sorry to Jason and his cast and crew up in the UK, you guys and gals got talent, but this was not a good showing for it.",1411689600,,1796,4.254385964912281
8627486,1,B00GTSVPC4,"Being a huge fan of indie horror films, I've learned that they are not all great. Sometimes they are just bad, but I always finish them and I usually find a couple of redeeming qualities..Boobs, good effect, a good plot, good dialogue...THIS HAS NONE OF THOSE!!!!!!!!..This is the worst homemade looking garbage I've ever seen. I know the pains of making movies. This is a bunch of teenagers with horrible costumes, horrible effects (pink blood) and zero redeeming qualities.

 In the first five seconds of the first ""movie"" in this collection, you get to see an overweight actress with floppy boobs in the shower, with cut scenes of a Teenage boy walking thru the woods...this goes on, switching back and forth between the two for twenty minutes. The shower scene: ...I like boobs...these are not good boobs. The killer looks like he's 12 and he's scary, why???? because he's wearing his dad's flannel shirt with some pepto bismol poured on it. The scene on the cover....I'm not even sure THAT girl is in one of these ""Movies""

Do not buy this movie, do not watch this movie, and if you know Jason Impey Slap him hard in the face and take his camcorder away from him. He has no business making movies. I want my money and wasted time back you son of a .....

I would give this negative stars if i could.",1396569600,5,1304,4.55982905982906
