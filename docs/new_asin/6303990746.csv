753547,2,6303990746,"...Now, I've the utmost respect for Bjork's music and acting skills. Granted, she is decent enough in this. But this film would never have been released in the USA if she wasn't in it. ...",1034294400,2,188,4.4
753548,4,6303990746,"Bjork, Iceland's eccentric and eclectic artist, singer and actress stars in ""THE JUNIPER TREE.""
Shot in black and white on bleak locations in Iceland, the story is an old folk tale adapted from the Brothers Grimm archives.  And grim it is.  Bjork is Margit.  When her mother is burned at the stake for practicing witchcraft, she and her older sister Katla flee across Iceland's rugged terrain until they reach the remote farmhouse owned by handsome widower Johann. Katla casts a seductive spell on Johann and bewitches him.  Soon they are wed, much to the dismay of Johann's suspicious young son Jonas who sees clearly what has happened to his dad.  Things get increasingly tense and Margit is forced into the spiritual world to save Jonas from Katla's supernatural wrath.
This dark, brooding mystical tale is nicely visualized and Bjork is a natural actress. And yes, she sings.  Extras include an interview with director Nietzchka Keene, deleted scenes and publicity photos.",1026864000,29,976,5.06875
753549,4,6303990746,"Having been a huge Bjork fan for about 7 years, about five of those years have been spent hunting for a copy of 'The Juniper Tree' in the UK...However, after a dear friend bought me the DVD edition (with suprisingly wonderful extra features on the disc!) for my birthday, I've finally got to see what all the fuss is about!
I practically own Bjork's entire back catalogue, and worship 'Dancer In The Dark', but I promised my self that when I watched 'The Juniper Tree' for the first time, I'd try to do so with an open mind, and try not to be biased. Although the movie is a challenge to watch... I was not dissapointed.
This dark tale see's Margit (Bjork) and her sister Katla trying to rebuild their lives after their mother is burnt at the stake for practising witchcraft. So the sisters don't get the same fate, they flee across Iceland where Katla discovers a young widower and his son living alone. Through the use of Katla's withcraft, she is soon Married to the young widower, much to the dissaproval of his young son.
The rest of the movie focusses of Margit as she try's to come to terms with her own Growing magical powers, and try's her hardest to use them to protect the young boy from Katla's influence.
I'll admit that there are times when the film is difficult to watch, and frequently takes itself on little tangents elsewhere and there even some quite disturbing and graphic scenes; but the performances are very powerful & thought-provoking and if you do manage to sit through the entire film you do end up feeling like you've accomplished something and feel strangely rewarded.
Although filmed in 1987, the black & white photography and numerous beautiful shots of Iceland's legendary landscape, make you feel this was shot in the 1940's. Although the directory has manged to successfully capture the medi-evil pagan era of the movie very well. And the question on everyones lips... How well does Bjork do in the film? Her acting ability is remarkable considering this is her debut venture into a field of media she knew nothing about. And it is Bjork's portrayal of the niave young girl coming to terms with the death of her mother and her own inner witchcraft that holds the film together, and in the final scene as Margit reveals what Katla has done... you can't but feel strangely moved.
Although Bjork herself doesnt think off this as her first film cuz she had ""Just had a kid, and didn't really know what she was doing!"", she should really give herslef more credit for this, as it's a remarkable debut... totally uncomparable to her prtrayal as Selma in 'Dancer In The Dark', But 'The Juniper Tree' is almost as rewarding.
I do highly recommend this film. If you have the disciplne to sit still and really concentrate... You'll be touched!",1021593600,12,2766,4.658486707566462
753550,5,6303990746,"This film deserves more appreciation. It was a great discovery, I probably would never have found it without my penchant for Bjork
After their mother is burned at the stake for practicing witchcraft. Margit (Bjork) and her older sister Katla, journey far away where no one will know them, because they fear they too will be burned.
In the first minutes of the film, they see a woman floating face down in a creek, her hands bound behind her. Margit asks who she is; Katla replies ""I don't know, but we haven't gone far enough away from home"". Soon they're in the company of a young farmer and widower, Johann, who Katla bewitches with her magic.
But Jonas, Johann's young son is suspicious, and fears she is trying to take his dead mother's place. Angering Katla.--she wants Johann all to herself, and resents Jonas.
Margit's mother starts to appear to her, first outside her window, then she sees her up close, when she and Katla are at the beach. Katla begs Margit to tell her what she sees, but her mother motions to Margit not to tell.
Margit  bonds with the Jonas and tries to protect him from her older sister, but with tragic however *mystical* results.
Beautifully shot in black and white
Based on a story of the same name, by the brothers Grimm
Ends with Bjork reciting this passage:
Once there were two children, whose mother was a bird.
They flew away with her, to the land of the birds.
But she sent them back among people, to take care of their father.
When they returned from the land of the birds,
their father had found a new wife and did not know them.
She closed his eyes to them, and filled his hearing with her voice.
Sent her laughter over the mountains, and he followed.
His children called after him, but he did not know their voices.
So they stayed behind...and they knew what the birds knew.
The black & white, plus the beautiful photography, mysterious content and brooding thoughful nature...sort of reminded me of a Bergman film
And for Bjork fans, it should be added that she does sing..:-)",1005436800,4,2019,4.56198347107438
753551,5,6303990746,"i love this movie. it's quite unique, in an o therworldy unhurried sort of way. it's based quite a long time ago in an incredibly remote land. i think it was filmed in iceland, and the images are captured in such a marvelous way that it's worth seeing even without a story. it has beautiful music, with strings; violins, maybe some cellos. and of course bjork is the highlight. she is very young in this film, maybe just before the sugarcubes, and she plays this very pure and simple girl, quiet, strong, and a seer of visions. this is a subtle film, one of quiet magic; i cherish the special presence bjork offers here in humble adoration",1003017600,5,639,4.47008547008547
753552,5,6303990746,"Not for the impatient viewer, and not for those who want to be entertained and don't want to think, ""The Juniper Tree"" is memorable and mysterious, magical, seductive, and stark. Bjork is to be commended for her  brilliant portrayal as a younger sister with the ""gift"" of  witchcraft. Her performance is so compelling that one *almost* wishes she  had chosen acting and not music as her career. Filmed in black and white on  location in Bjork's native Iceland, one is trasported immediately to a  landscape which is not only dramatic but nearly alien. The story itself is  based on a fairy tale by the brothers Grimm (regretfully, the credits do  not specify *which* story!), and ends, as do many of Grimms' stories, in  tragedy and darkness. A must-see for anyone who appreciates  ""difference"" in films, who's willing to ponder and is not simply  concerned with instant gratification.",922752000,12,885,4.959183673469388
753553,4,6303990746,"The Juniper tree was quite a nice flick. I  rented it because I had seen my most fav singer ""bjork"" was on the cover ,and was staring in it. Me and my girlfriend watched it an were soothed into a meditative type  state. The articulate, patient, calmness of the movie just did it. the  movie is also filmed in black/white which gave it that erie feeling. The  plot was just so unique. And Bjork was just too cute. I didn't give this  flick 5 stars because it's not the kind of movie I can watch over and over.  It's that moody kind of movie. If you buy this movie sit quietly,  peacefully, and ""possably maybe"" by yourself. escape into this  movie. You will apreciate it being in your memory. I loved it.",915926400,8,703,4.2727272727272725

7858535,2,6303990746,"Movie is entirely in black and white.  Very little dialogue.  Very artsy.  I had to watch it 5 times before I saw it all.  Your not missing anything.  Bjork is the only reason I watched, and even she wasn't enough.  Without her I would have given 1 star.  Get ""dancer in the dark"" instead.",1264809600,,289,4.2407407407407405
7858536,3,6303990746,"Released originally on 1990, this film marks the debut performance of the Icelandic star Bjork, who we have seen more recently in ""Dancer in the dark"" and ""Drawing restraint 9"". Filmed in black and white, this movie tells the story of two witch sisters who flee after their mother is burned for practicing witchcraft. The movie is based on a story by the Grimm Brothers.

Even though the movie has a couple of good moments, it is not a dark tale of mysticism as the cover of the DVD tries to sell, in fact it is too slow and the strange way in which it is edited does not help at all. Had it been a shorter film with only the key points it might have been a better film. Bjork's performance is quite decent but nothing more and so are the rest of the actors in this film.

The movie is presented in full screen and on a not so good digital transfer, no subtitles are available. Extra features contain deleted scenes with some bloopers, an interview with the writer/director Nietzchka Keene and a slide show of publicity photos.

An average film that should obviously be a must for all Bjork fans.",1145232000,,1096,4.389162561576355
7858537,3,6303990746,"The 'Juniper Tree' is a slow, somber, methodical film with a weak storyline which at times becomes almost incoherent. However having said that I will also say that the true beauty of this film is not to be found in the story it tells, but in the visuals. Filmed in Iceland, a place where few of us have ever gone or will go, we get a glimpse of this beautiful and challenging island. Hostile, yet enchanting it appears as a world one can easily imagine to be populated by the mythical beings of Norse mythology, making it a perfect location for a tale of mysticism and witchcraft.

Katla (Bryndis Petra Bragadottir) and her younger sister Margit (Bjork) have left their village after their Mother (Guorun Gisladottir) has been burned to death by the villagers for practicing witchcraft. As they wander through the countryside they eventually come upon a small dwelling occupied by a recently widowed man and his son. They take refuge in his home and before long Katla begins to work her magic to win the heart of their unsuspecting benefactor.

Unquestionably the best moments in the film are young Margit's disturbing visions of her Mother's spirit. Guorun Gisladottir's long, matted dark hair and flowing, faded clothing are the perfect compliment to the frozen tundra surrounding her. As she sits silently amongst the protruding rocks she strikes a chilling pose in harmony with the stark, evocative Icelandic landscape.

This is not a film that stands up well to repeated viewings, but it has its moments. Now if you're a big Bjork fan that's a different story.",1135468800,6,1565,4.853932584269663
7858538,5,6303990746,"Bjork played an outstanding role, her part as a witch was great. This film is in black and white, which only adds to the intrigue.  She makes you feel like you are there, with her and her sister.  The man her sister marries has a son who cannot accept her.  Bjork is accepted after a trial period by the son, but the sister attempts her own witchcraft on his father, which seems to work.  The son catches on fast, he wants to know where Bjork and her sister come from, Bjork does not give him a straight answer just comments ""somewhere far away, that does not exist anymore"", this film will take your imagination far into the past.  The clothing everyone wore was right for the time period, to me it was very Nomadic.  Bjork is not only a great musician, but also a great actress.  Her performance is superb.",1110067200,,808,4.346666666666667
7858539,2,6303990746,"""The Juniper Tree"" features Bjrk's first attempt at acting; though the movie is not very good, it is definitely worth taking a look at if only just to see Bjrk as a young actress!  I would only recommend this movie to true Bjork fans!",1093737600,4,234,4.318181818181818
