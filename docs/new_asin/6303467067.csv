7847881,5,6303467067,"I went in search of this tape not for the first, featured episode but because of the second, ""Night of the Dark Turtle."" It's one of my favorites.  This was such a great series and I miss it.
An argument among the turtles concerning the virtues of brain vs. brawn prompts Donatello to boast he could take on Shredder single-handedly using his intelligence and technology.  Just then, they hear of Shredder forcing a scientist to create the Micro-Blaster, a tiny laser device the size of a battery with enough fire power to destroy an entire building with a single blast.  Donatello attempts to come through on his threat, and is seriously injured while the micro-blaster is accidentally lost in the lab.  The turtles flee with their unconscious friend while Shredder escapes.
Back at the lair, Donatello awakes in a mad fury and becomes obsessed with wanting a second chance at taking Shredder down permanently.  Deciding he needs new tactics, one of Michaelangelo's comic books inspire Don to change his image to a fierce some costume to strike fear into the hearts of ""cowardly superstitious lot of criminals.""  He eludes his brothers with some pillows in his bed, and leaves as the ""Dark Turtle.""  ...  Not even his three brothers are enough to stop him.  He begins roughing up and shaking down criminals trying to find information about the Shredder and his intentions.  Meanwhile, the Shredder has teamed up with the Wolf Jackson gang in order to break back into the lab to retrieve the micro-blaster, and if that wasn't enough, a group of dinosaur-like aliens called the Tri-ceratons have invaded Earth and are beginning hostile take-over!  Donatello turns more and more violent the closer he gets to Shredder.  When he finally confronts him, Donatello fights the Shredder without his normally ethical TMNT turtle convictions holding him back. ... Michealangelo accidentally causes Donatello to repeat his earlier injury, bringing him to his senses.  Using robot dinosaurs from the museum, the micro-blaster from Shredder, and the Dark Turtle's sinister image, they are able to frighten off the Triceratons.  Thanks to Donatello's quick-thinking, and a little help from Shredder, the day is saved!  So even the evil vile Shredder had some good use.  But Don had come so close, without his turtle code, he had almost succeeded in ridding the world of Shredder for good. ...",1034985600,2,2378,5.012722646310433
7847882,1,6303467067,"Some criminals escape form Dimension X and want to (surprise!) conquer Earth. Then the Turtles try to stop em (wow this is just full of surprises, eh?). The 2nd episode is notable only b/c it marks the 1st and only  appearance of the Triceratons out side of the comics, where they are major  villians to the TMNT.
These cartoons are dreadful. Its a shame to see  such a great comic creation become such a cliched, derivative, sugar-coated  kiddie show. And to think this cartoon actually got even worse!!!",938736000,3,505,4.704545454545454
