5382168,4,B00A6AAQ8A,"I had no idea what to expect but this sounded clever so I gave it a shot.  What a surprise!  This movie is just delightful.  In spite of the reasonable expectation of high camp it stears a steady course with genuine, sweet laughs and warm holiday cheer.  It is a twist on a timeless classic told through a refreshingly new lens that reveals we are all a lot more alike than you might think.  Utterly charming and sentimental.  I cried real happy tears!  Highly recommened. And the soundtrack is amazing...",1354320000,5,505,4.544444444444444
5382169,4,B00A6AAQ8A,"Scrooge and Marley is a modern-day version of Dicken's ""A Christmas Carol"", presented with heart and a gay sensibility.  It's a  very warm, funny movie--one that the whole family can enjoy.  You simply can't go wrong with gay royalty Bruce Vilanch as Fezziweg or using poppers as a prop.

Last night saw the premiere at the Music Box Theater in Chicago (where the movie was filmed using local talent).  Loved the original music score.  It may have been filmed with a shoestring budget, but it delivers a very powerful message.  To echo the film's producers, it shows our non-gay friends and relatives that we are more like alike each other than we are different.

5382170,5,B00A6AAQ8A,"This is a fun, gay-oriented take on the classic tale, but set in modern times. It keeps the sense of Dickens' story and makes for some very interesting characters. It may not appeal to straight viewers, but gay viewers will no doubt find the movie worth watching.",1483142400,,263,4.617021276595745
5382171,1,B00A6AAQ8A,"FULL DISCLOSURE: I'm a homophobe, and this is version of Charles Dickens' classic tale, A Christmas Carol, features homosexuality. I'm also a conservative, and this film is full of modern liberal buzz words, such as ""health care,"" ""community"" and ""giving back.""  Although it references Paducah, which is in Kentucky, it seems more like it takes place in West Hollywood, California.

Having thus explained why I'm giving this film One Star, I would like to add that this version is irreverent, with a version of ""God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen"" altered to mention ""booze"" and getting ""laid.""

If I were more open-minded, I would give this film more stars for original musical numbers, as well as the unique spins and twists on the classic tale of redemption and repentance.",1480204800,2,769,4.9921875

5382177,5,B00A6AAQ8A,"I should have written this a long time ago... better late than never! There was a screening of Scrooge & Marley and talk back with the executive producer, actors David Moretti, David Pevsner & Ronnie Kroell and other crew members at a theater in Pasadena CA a few years ago. I almost didn't go because no one would go with me but I sucked it up, bought a ticket and went by myself... I'm so glad I did. I'm not shy so I met a few people as soon as I got to the theater and we all sat together. This film is a gay themed film but it's something for everyone and all can enjoy it! The cast couldn't be more perfect; David Moretti, Ronnie Kroell, Megan Cavanagh, Tim Kazurinsky, Bruce Vilanch, Rusty Schwimmer and of course David Pevsner! Just the perfect fit and not a single bad performance! The original soundtrack is amazing so I'm sure you'll probably want to buy that too after watching this. We've all seen dozens of versions of A Christmas Carol over the years but none moved me as much as this one - this is the first one to make me cry. The woman sitting next to me, whom I had just met not even 2 hours earlier, and I both started to cry at the same time, she reached into her purse, pulled out a wad of kleenex, handed me one and we hugged as we cried. Keep and open mind and and open heart and you'll love this movie!!",1449532800,2,1328,4.1312741312741315
5382178,3,B00A6AAQ8A,"An okay retelling for a low budget film, but it's missing more drama and storytelling elements that could have brought out the humanity of Scrooge more rather than raise a bunch of gay issues that are resolved too easily and quickly.",1433635200,,233,4.7073170731707314

The main character, Ebenezer Scrooge ( geniously played by David Pevsner) is a great moron whom love avoided years ago and greed settled down in his heart. But this year, his life will change forever.
This movie is an incredible amalgam of well done work. The original music and lyrics, the performances and the good taste creates this funny and sometimes sad movie.

5382187,4,B00A6AAQ8A,During Christmas I make it a point to watch different adaptations of 'A Christmas Carol' and was excited when I found one that incorporated a gay twist to a classic story.

5382203,5,B00A6AAQ8A,"I didn't expect much in terms of quality, as the movie is very low budget and I found out about the movie when they were trying to raise enough money to finish the film. However, I really enjoyed the movie. Despite a few weak special effects, the movie has a lot of heart and the actors' enthusiasm for the story shines.

If watching we children, there is a very harsh scene when Scrooge's father discovers him with his boyfriend, and the father violently throws him out of the house. This scene may be difficult for children to understand. Also, Scrooge's life on the street implies some connection to prostitution, but depending on the child's age, the references may go over his/her head. Movie may be appropriate depending on the age and maturity of your child/children, but I would suggest an adult-only preview first.",1358726400,5,823,4.755244755244755

5382206,4,B00A6AAQ8A,"Scrooge & Marley is a wonderful feel-good movie filled with music, drama, gay characters (some of whom are very good-looking), and some comedy elements as well. It isn't perfect, as the pace lags at times. But this is still a very good movie that will lift your spirits and entertain for the most part.",1358121600,,302,4.611111111111111
5382207,3,B00A6AAQ8A,"The concept and story were just what I had hoped they would be but the execution just didn't quite pull me in. The back story for Ben was believable and well put together. Christmas Past was the best part of the show.
Ben's ""Will the child live?"" reaction to Tiny Tim was totally unbelievable given his attitude up to that point and Present's comment about ""Decrease the surplus population"" was in response to a line that had evidently been cut from earlier in the movie.
A few of the musical numbers were nice, some were even stirring but - I had hoped for more. The story was kind of choppy in the last half and seemed to leave out some connecting material.",1358121600,,659,4.409836065573771
5382208,5,B00A6AAQ8A,"I was surprised at how closely this follows the original Christmas Carol while being totally Gay!  Well written, well acted, wealth of LGBT personalities you have met before, but never this way.  A modern Chicago boys town presentation that is probably closer to the spirit of Dickens than many of the recent ""straight"" remakes of the Victorian original.  Watched it twice the first night.",1357430400,4,389,5.046875
5382209,4,B00A6AAQ8A,"Having seen just about every version of this classic holiday tale, I was looking forward to new take on Dicken's classic.  This story, to a certain extent, revels in being the gay version of the story, revolving around the title character set in the present as a nightclub owner who treats his employees like trash, and poops on good will and generosity--until the ghosts appear.
There are some negatives to this film..the constant musical interludes from the ingenue singer in the nightclub would merely be distracting if they weren't annoying.  These sequences take up screen time unnecessarily, and put a comical spin on this story that feels forced and out-of-place.
Other than that, the tale is a solid and dramatic life story that could have happened to anyone. From Scrooge's estrangement from his family, to forming a new familial relationship, and then buckling under to greed and callousness, there is a But-for-the-grace-of-God vibe here as Scrooge discovers that what seemed to be a good idea has consequences that he does not see. These consequences are tender, well-handled, and feel real as the actors portray simply what people do.
Overall, without spoilers, I'd have to say this version is warm and has some realistically sad scenes to remind us of what the core of the Dickens classic is about.  There is an epilogue of sorts, following the end credits, and the last song sung by Barbara Streisand's son is 'Amazing'.  This story is a good addition to any Christmas collection.",1357344000,,1495,4.991967871485944
5382210,4,B00A6AAQ8A,"My only complaint about this movie was that there was not more Megan Cavanagh.  It was a very fun retelling of the classic Christmas Carol story, with added humor and present day issues.  It takes place in Chicago and the opening scenes of Christmas in Chicago were especially wonderful.  Good acting all around and the soundtrack features some terrific voices.",1356652800,3,361,4.983333333333333
5382211,5,B00A6AAQ8A,"I heard about Scrooge & Marley on Twitter and decided to buy the film when someone sent out a tweet with the Amazon link. It arrived in Australia in about 7 days, which was pretty good seeing as the Christmas holiday was in the middle of that.

Scrooge & Marley gives us a gay retelling of the classic Dickens novel, A Christmas Carol. Ben Scrooge is a crabby, angry business man, an owner of a gay bar who hates the community and everyone else within eye shot. On Xmas eve the ghost of his dead business partner Jacob Marley visits him to advise if he's not careful, he'll spend eternity chained to his sins.

This most recent retelling of the classic story has a fantastic cast of strong actors who seem to thoroughly enjoy their time as their characters. The standards of the tale are there, but with a gay twist and the spontaneous song and dance numbers are highly fun.

Having watched the film yesterday I'm confident in saying it's now a scheduled part of my ""must-watch holiday viewing"".

If you're after a fun, light-hearted holiday story about love and redemption, Scrooge & Marley is a must own. I've got a feeling that Christmas time or not, it's a film I'll watch again and again.",1356566400,3,1193,4.5092592592592595
5382212,4,B00A6AAQ8A,"We enjoyed this movie, especially the music, which was excellent. Some great acting, some so-so acting, some really good drama, some camp. Overall, it was sweet and touching, and i believe it will become a cult classic. I know we will enjoy watching it again next year. And we will be buying the soundtrack, too!

I really appreciated the fact that this was written with a gay perspective, which made it especially meaningful to me.",1356307200,2,432,4.76

5382216,3,B00A6AAQ8A,"This gay and updated version of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol could become a cult classic. But it also has a message for everyone. Just as gay people can appreciate the many straight versions of this famous tear-jerking tale, so people of all persuasions can enjoy Scrooge & Marley - if they abandon prejudice.
The movie was made for $100,000 in just 12 days, a great feat. I would have liked to have seen how much better it could have been with bigger bucks behind it. Fans will love it, maybe partly because of, rather than despite, its occasional student movie feel - watch out for when the Ghost of Christmas Present reveals the children beneath his robe. Despite its limitations, this production is funny and sweet and the story is so strong that I still had to wipe away a tear.
Part of the fun is guessing how our beloved characters and scenes will be given a gay and contemporary twist. I don't want too spoil too many surprises, but to give you a taster, Scrooge is gay with a homophobic father who kicked him out of the family home. Though he owns a successful piano bar, called Screws, Scrooge won't start an employee health plan or donate to an Aids charity. He attributes seeing Marley's ghost not to an ""undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato"", but to MSG in his Chinese food. Scrooge's long-suffering and underpaid assistant, Bob Cratchit, has a male partner and adopted children.
As in the original story written in 1843, there is social comment. Fezziwig, is depicted by Dickens as a jolly, kind boss who cared for his employees before the industrial revolution swept many men like him aside. In Scrooge & Marley he is a disco owner who nurtured his employees in the gentler business atmosphere of the nineteen seventies before greed became good.
Music, bursting with vitality, is a big part of this movie. The comedy songs are perfect for singalongs. Jason Gould, actor/director son of Barbra Streisand and Elliot Gould, performs the film's theme and special end credit song, ""Amazing,"" which could well become a gay anthem. He has a lustrous voice.
Oh and I love that this movie hints that Marley has a chance of redemption. I have always worried about Marley.",1354579200,10,2241,4.690355329949239
