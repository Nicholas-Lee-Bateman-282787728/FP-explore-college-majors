7753264,3,B01G1S6RO2,"An interesting historic film.  Not the best acting, but OK.",1472774400,2,59,4.9
7753265,5,B01G1S6RO2,"This is a moving film about a less well-known fascist atrocity (outside Spain, at least). Many people may be familiar with Picasso's painting, but this is the first full length movie to focus on portraying the event and the lead-up to it. The main male protagonist is inspired by the British journalist George Steer, a correspondent for the Times who reported on the bombardment. But the other main characters - including the weak Russian communist - are (obviously) entirely fictional. As with most feature films about historical events, it does not aim to portray a ""true"" version of the destruction of Guernica, but rather to tell a good story and to raise an international audience's awareness of the event. The story - of love inspiring the best and worst in people - is well-paced, there is obvious chemistry between the two main actors, and the movie is shot with the beautiful backdrop of Basque towns, coast and countryside. Highly recommended.",1471824000,,953,4.9625
7753266,1,B01G1S6RO2,"The film deals with a very important historical event that unfortunately is treated with both deception and some ideologically driven idiocy.  The film disparages the Soviet Unions support for the forces of democratic Spain, while remaining totally silent regarding the U.S.'s support for fascist Franco who was aligned with and also supported by Hitler.  The Russians supporting the legitimate government of Spain are portrayed in the worst possible light, while an American reporter is of course but the end the hero.  No mention of course that in the real world the U.S. had cut off any aid and support for the legitimate democratically elected government of Spain, the non-fascist government, while at the same time American corporations, including truck and oil companies, supported the fascist Franco regime aligned with Hitler.  Franco's government acknowledged they could never have won the civil war without U.S. support.  Such U.S. support for this fascist dictator continued until his death in 1975.  But don't worry, you won't be bothered by any of that ""history"" stuff in this film.  No, that would entail some attempt at historical accuracy and this film was not about historical accuracy.  In the end it ends up being another ""U.S. good - Russians bad,"" piece of political propaganda that will leave one with a less rather than more accurate understanding of the historical events in question.  Kind of like a high school history class.  Funny how that happens when Hollywood gets involved.",1471737600,5,1505,5.20746887966805
7753267,4,B01G1S6RO2,"James DArcy plays an American journalist who is stationed in Guernica in 1937. The German Condor Legion is active and the war is raging all around, but the Republic have strict orders to only allow good news out and as such all journalists are censored to the point of mere mouths for propaganda.

Meanwhile he sort of falls for Teresa who is one of the censors, but her Soviet boss, Vasyl (Jack Davenport) is also romantically committed to her and does not take kindly to the dalliance. We also have the brilliant Burn Gorman playing a NKVD agent who is deliciously ruthless (great piece of casting too) and he brings some welcome spice to the proceedings. What follows are the events that put Guernica on the map  for all the wrong reasons.

This is a really well made film with some great performances (accents aside) and high class CGI and a nice attention to detail. The love interest is good but not really going to be legendary and some could say that the bombing was under done, but I found it to be about right  we don't need loads of screen time of people suffering to make the point. In English, Castilian, Basque and some German with good to average sub titles, this is a film that is very much worth checking out.",1471564800,6,1226,4.484304932735426
7753268,4,B01G1S6RO2,"The film is a fictionalized drama of a true story, based on the events that took place April 26, 1937 in Guernica during the Spanish Civil War. The movie follows the life of famed American reporter Henry Howe (James D'Arcy) as he attempts to get out stories while being censored. He is embedded with the rebels in Basque country, aided by Russian communists. The rebels are fighting for a Democratic Spain against Franco, supported by Germany and Italy. A new war technique is going to be used on that said day as the film starts a week earlier, giving us enough time to develop a love story.

This is a film on the Spanish Civil War that doesn't involve Hemingway, the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, or a labyrinth...although Hemingway was mentioned. Like a Hemingway novel on the Spanish Civil War, the film is a bit laborious to get through and there is a bell that tolls. This is not a documentary it is a historical novel and does not involve zombies.

The film is done in multiple languages, English, Spanish, German, Russian, and maybe Basque, French, and Italian. You might want to make sure you get something with subtitles. It is mostly a drama with a protagonist that wasn't that likeable and sees the war through his hip flask. Not for everyone.

Guide: No swearing (In English anyway). Brief nudity (Mar&iacute;a Valverde).",1471046400,2,1330,4.748917748917749
7753269,2,B01G1S6RO2,"Recklessly suggesting that a (fictional?) Soviet commander's cruelty (does someone have the historical references here?) was equal to or even worse than the Nazi Luftwaffe's firebombing of the Basque village in 1937, we find the story centers on a brief love affair between Basque loyalist Maria Valverde and James D'Arcy trying his darnedest to seem like Gary Cooper in the infinitely superior 1943 Hemingway adaption For Whom the Bell Tolls. D'Arcy just does not have it in him (though Valverde is very good, almost worth four stars by herself). The entire exercise quickly collapses into a cliche action/war drama using all the standard hollywood tropes of melodramatic wall-to-wall music (just in case we did not get how ominous it is to watch incendiary bombs being loaded onto German Dornier Do 17 planes before watching them swarm like hornets overhead of peaceful rolling hills of forest and unarmed peasants below) but perhaps the biggest gripe is how the German and Spanish Fascists become a plot device when Guernica (or as the Basque spell it Gernika) is horrifically wiped out after being used for barbaric target practice with a new type of areal warfare, though this unique criminal event is treated in this movie as the inevitable historical backdrop for an apparently darker story involving Maria's betrayal and torture by a weak local communist leader unwilling to stand up to Stalin's orders from afar. Though there seems to be no evidence for any of this (reports about the Spanish Civil War by journalist George Steer - the character Darcy is playing and whose story is allegedly being told here- do not mention any of this backstory from what I can ascertain- the movie when all is said and done is rife with political and moral ambiguities (including the fact that the pro-Fascist reporter comes off as a pseudo-hero at the end. Seriously?).",1470960000,8,1864,5.016129032258065
7753290,5,B01G1S6RO2,"Emotional and realistic story that explains the Spanish Civil War to the world. Script, direction, music and acting are high quality. If you are for the adrenalyne and the crashes, this is not your film. However, it is sensitive and honest.",1486684800,,240,4.878048780487805
7753291,3,B01G1S6RO2,"This film is great for its historical value, but boring as a film. It was more of a love story than an action film. If you're into history, you should enjoy this one.",1485820800,,166,4.0606060606060606
7753292,5,B01G1S6RO2,A true story of Germany bombing Spain at the beginning of World War II as a birthday present for Hitler. Red box held this movie back during the election.  They did not want to make the Communist and Socialist look bad. A Must see movie.,1485648000,5,237,4.266666666666667
7753293,2,B01G1S6RO2,"D'arcys acting in this movie totally ruined the film for me. He was flat, ineffective, like a sullen teenager. Steer clear, although this film does dramatically portray some of the horrors of warfare.",1485388800,,200,5.090909090909091

7753297,2,B01G1S6RO2,"Just disappointing on multiple levels. Convoluted with some predictable sex thrown in, although nothing sexually graphic. I could have saved time and money (purchased based on trailer) if I'd just have Googled ""Guernica.""",1480291200,4,221,5.7272727272727275

I also love all types of historical dramas.  What happened in Guernica is so tragic.

8761945,4,B01G1S6RO2,"A really good movie about a Spanish town and it's people during the Spanish civil war as it is covered by foreign reporters. The town was to be wiped out and used ad the eventual test ground for the blitzkrieg tactics of the Germans that would be used during the first couple of years of World War II.  Pretty good script, no real dull spots, well written dialogue and some pretty hefty acting performances.  Not sure how accurate the story is but I liked the movie very much.  Not a 5 star blockbuster, but definitely good and worth your time watching.",1511568000,,553,4.455445544554456

8761951,2,B01G1S6RO2,"This movie tried to do too much and was confusing. Loved James D'Arcy in Master and Commander. In Guernica, he plays a disillusioned journalist, but doesn't quite make it real. The dialogue and acting didn't do justice to what must have been a pretty expensive movie to make. And the photographer Martha annoyed me right off the bat, putting herself and others in danger at every opportunity. It was one of those movies where you can't forget it's just a movie.",1487894400,6,461,4.703703703703703
