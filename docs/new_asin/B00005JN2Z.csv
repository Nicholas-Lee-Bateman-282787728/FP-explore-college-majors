1525663,4,B00005JN2Z,"Ok, so, help me out here: Mr scruffy tough guy nihilistic sociopath hit man with hip sunglasses and a killer steel-gray suit(Tom Cruise) comes to L.A. hired to kill six people. He is walking the streets with thousand of dollars cash in his pockets, has vastly superior physical skills, slings and shoots a double-barrel magnum like he's flinging a biscuit to a poodle, and carries a highly sophisticated laptop loaded with a wireless internet connection and a file that includes the pictures, names, addresses and biographical summaries of his six victims. But he needs a cabbie (Jamie Foxx) to take him around the city while he knocks people off? Some guy he's never met and feels no need to kill even though he will be the number one witness to the crimes and the murderer? As for researching the directions to get himself around a city he has admittedly visited many times before -- oops. Kinda screwed up there. Oh well. Let's hop a cab. Most hilarious of all is the arrogant hitman's assertion that anonymity is his ""code"". Right -- when I want to remain anonymous, I always make sure to ask a cabby to drive me around one of the biggest cities in the world all night while I go kill people. Of course.

 If an appreciation of a work of art requires the suspension of disbelief, ""Collateral"" requires a lobotomy. A 2003 census of the total population of Los Angeles clocks in at 9,871,506 people. And out of those near-10 million people, two of the key players in the biggest murder to go down that night just happen to pop into precisely the same cab, one immediately following the other. These are merely a few of the many illogical conveniences the film's plot relies on for its story and action to unfold. Yet this wholly unbelievable scenario manages to pull itself off, thanks to the compelling work of Jamie Fox, whose tandem with the brutally suave Tom Cruise gradually rises to a fever pitch of suspense, humor and moral quandry. Fox turns in an endearing and intense performance as an under-achieving cabbie who is hurled into epiphany by circumstances beyond his imagination or control, while Tom Cruise delivers his strongest performance since playing a sleezy and misogynistic motivational speaker in ""Magnolia"". The premise the film depends on for its effect is entirely fantastic and challenges even the most boundless imagination, but Michael Mann's script and instinct for suspense does more than save the film: it makes for one of the year's finest movies. If you are willing to relinquish your grounding in the real world in exchange for the thrill ride of the summer, you're in for a real treat. If you want your stories to happen in the world you live in, though, you're looking in the wrong place.",1091750400,2,2724,4.7568710359408035
1525664,5,B00005JN2Z,Just returned from seeing this movie.  It was one the best movies I have seen so far this year.  You have to listen to the dialogue carefully - will want to see this one again - well acted - well directed - Cruise and Foxx are at their best - didn't expect the comic dialogue - the suspense - the action - the insight into the depth of the characters is extremely well done -,1091750400,,375,3.986666666666667
1525665,5,B00005JN2Z,"Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx are outstanding! Without a doubt Tom Cruise will be nominated and most likely win the best actor Oscar (Denzel got one for a much more basic bad-guy role) for his role as the cool and dangerous hitman named Vincent. Foxx should at least get nominated for a supporting role, because he proves to everyone that he can hold his own with Cruise. Without these two casting choices the movie wouldn't be half as good. The plot is a little thin and predictable at times, but the dialogue is written very well and the direction is tight. The action scenes (mainly Tom kicking butt) aren't gory, but they are brutal and fast much as they would be in a real fight with a trained killer delivering the blows. The realism of the film adds much more depth and some of the time I completely forgot I was watching a hollywood made movie. Kudos to all involved and thanks Micheal Mann for reviving the thriller/suspense genre in such a stylish way.",1091750400,2,958,4.511494252873563
1525666,5,B00005JN2Z,"Los Angeles, the City of Angels. Under a blank, blue sky, millions of people go to sleep, go to work, endure the daily grind. The monotonous cycle, over and over again. With nightfall, the street lights glow a shade of murky yellow; the coyotes come to prowl; and the city becomes beacon-like underworld in the midst of the darkness.

And it started like any other night...

Max (Jamie Foxx) is a 12-year veteran cabbie making the rounds to achieve a dream that, by the day, becomes more and more just that. One fateful evening, a grey-haired fare by the name of Vincent hires his services and his life will never be the same...

Vincent is an assassin, sent to kill five key players in a major drug case. He meant to complete his assignment without Max ever knowing the better, but situations are compromised, fate intervenes. Now, Max is caught up in the uncomfortable position of driving this killer from hit to hit, always knowing that, at any time, he himself could be killed.

Filmed on location in LA, words simply fail to describe the excellence of this film. Every single bit that comprises this masterpiece was crafted so well: the direction, the performances, the script.

Directed by Michael Mann, he uses a rather grainy filter for the movie, accentuating the griminess that is LA at night. The angles used are not at all cinematic in the typical sense; they're jolty at times, never contrived; natural. The lighting is interesting as most of the scenes, thought lit, provide an overwhelming sense of darkness, mirroring the overbearingly shady proceedings going on amongst the ignorant bliss of common folk.

The performances, most of them anyways, are not ""electrifying"" nor all those other fluff/buzz words; they are what they are meant to be: BELIEVABLE. Whether it's Max falling for one of his fares or Vincent just losing his intel, their emotions, actions, reactions all flow so smoothly; nothing is contrived. Tom Cruise as the brutally effective assassin Vincent is nothing less than inspired casting; after being bombarded with goody-goody roles for the extent of his career, he is finally revealing his dark side and he delivers. Every line, from the most scathing threat to sickly sweet falsified niceties, is spoken with complete disregard of the camera's existence. After this convincing performance, I am certain some will begin to question his Hollywood Nice Guy reputation.

But even more impressive yet is Jamie Foxx's turn as the befuddled cab driver Max. Grim at times, sometimes poignant, and with a touch of wry humor, his performance is simply unforgettable. He is able to show his character worry, contemplate, and mature so well.

Lastly, there is the incredible script. The dialogue never gets too movie-ish; there are no three-minute soliloquies or indecipherable metaphysical debates. These are spoken words by any person, any average citizen. The cab exchanges between Max and Vincent, besides showcasing the fantastic chemistry between Cruise and Foxx, become scenes of psychological warfare between the two. Max tries to prod into the inner workings of an essentially empty, driveless man while Vincent attemps to reveal the harmful nature of one man's complacency. Never does the dialogue become inaccessible or needlessly complex, always clear and to the point.

Many films are great. But rarely are they ever so close to perfection that you wonder when such a film can ever be outdone. Then again, Collateral is a rare movie in and of itself, the sum of all equally great parts, an exhilarating trip through Los Angeles, that it deserves to be one of those films.",1091750400,4,3610,5.013355592654424
1525667,5,B00005JN2Z,"Fans of ""Heat"" should not miss ""Collateral,"" a terrific thriller starring Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. Foxx plays a mild-mannered cab driver who has no idea that a normal-seeming fare is going to give him the ride of his life. The less you know about the plot the better, so i'll just mention that the cast is outstanding, the pacing is excellent, and there's surprising humor as well. In fact, at one point I found myself hoping that the movie was going to be as long as ""Heat"" (it wasn't) because I was enjoying it so much.",1091664000,,523,4.402061855670103
1525668,5,B00005JN2Z,"A hired killer comes into L.A. Five hits are on his list. How does he get to them all in one night? He hires a taxi. Tom Cruise plays Vincent, the killer. Jamie Fox plays Max the driver. Together, they go from one end of the city to the other, wreaking havoc, as Max tries to somehow get away and stop the carnage. But Vincent would have no compunctions about killing him or his mother, in the hospital and totally helpless.

 What can he do anyway? He's a man with dreams, but who has driven a cab for 12 years, telling himself and others that he has big plans and one day he'll give up this ""temporary"" job. Vincent taunts him as being someone who will never do anything with his life, as one after the other, the targets fall to the killer's gun. But the last one, means something to Max. Will he finally make a commitment, do something, be proactive instead of being acted against? Can anyone go up against a stone cold killer who knows his business and has never failed?

 Both Cruise and Fox are well cast in this thriller and Jada Pinkett Smith is believable as the woman who appears then disappears from Max's life. The tension ebbs and flows, then builds to a crescendo, only to rise again. A bizarre moment occurs when two coyotes appear in the night streets and one has to wonder if it's some sort of mirage. For the most part, this film will leave you breathless and perhaps wondering about your own values as you sympathize with the characters.",1091577600,,1457,4.385185185185185
1525669,5,B00005JN2Z,"Well worth seeing, more than the usual twists and turns, although I do have to say the ending may be hotly debated by viewers - good or bad? Even so, go see this one to see Tom Cruise departs from his usual ""good guy saves the world"" persona, playing a hit man who encounters an unwitting cabdriver and makes him part of his game plan.

 A solid and riveting movie, with a bit of philosophy thrown in, just enough to keep things from being formulaic, as Cruise and the cabbie debate ethics. Try to see it in a theatre without too many people or distractions so you can give it your full concentrations - and don't buy too much soda. You're not going to want to miss a moment of this one, let alone for a restroom break.

 Won't say more, this is one plot that doesn't deserve any spoilers.",1091577600,,789,4.24
1525670,5,B00005JN2Z,"I know this movie will be awesome this is a Micheal Mann movie. Just look at the list of movies he's made Manhunter, Heat (one of my all time favorites), The Insider (another one of my all time favorites), and Ali. In all Micheal Mann's movies there are alway's awesome plot's, plot twists and performances. Ten years ago Tom Cruise was an awesome bad guy in Interview with the vampire, and again Tom Cruise will be awesome as a bad guy. I know Jamie Foxx who is always good, and Mark Ruffalo will put on good perfomances. So be ready for a night on the town.",1089331200,,559,4.283018867924528

1525785,5,B00005JN2Z,"I have watched this film once a year for the past 5-6 years. Not only is it an excellent film overall, but it has undertones which carries profound meaning on several levels. The scene involving the wolf crossing the street at 3AM gives you a hint at the transcendental nature hidden throughout the film which is not obvious to the casual observer but is there for those able to pick up on it otherwise it's message is subliminal.",1516233600,,430,4.5256410256410255

1525788,4,B00005JN2Z,"The plot ends rather abruptly, but the dramatization of it all seems to make up for this in such a way that you don't really catch on. Tom Cruise's acting is so-so, Jamie Foxx is pretty good. The sound track is interesting the music blasts at strange points and at other points its like a ""normal movie"" it appears to be some sort of faulty dramatic effect, it leaves the viewer feeling awkward, but it passes and is soon forgotten,  If it Is your first time seeing this film it will appear surreal and keep you glued to your screen for the most part, and at the end, you'll go ""what?"". Still, many true things are stated in this movie though. It's different and unlike what is being produced today, far better than anything that has come out in the past 5 years in this genre. There is a lot of action and involvement with the character's lives, yet you're still an outsider. In sure they put a lot of hard work into it so kudos to them.",1512259200,,938,4.269662921348314

1525955,4,B00005JN2Z,This is a really great movie with excellent directing and acting by all parties involved. Tom Cruise is phenomenal. He seems to be one of the more versatile actors out there and there is something about him that is just always interesting to watch. He is definitely one of the best actors of our time. Jamie Foxx really steals the show here. He manages to inject some comedy into what could have been a really dark movie. It takes less than 10 minutes to establish his character and make him likable to the audience. That takes skill. The story itself is fascinating and original and you really don't know how it is going to end until the end of the movie. I did feel like the ending of the movie left a little bit to be desired and could have been executed better. That is really the only flaw that I found with this movie.,1502841600,2,824,4.32258064516129

1525999,4,B00005JN2Z,"Diving into a Michael Mann film requires a smidgen of knowing what you're getting into. First off, he is a fastidious, meticulous, detail-oriented director. Working for him isn't easy because he's so demanding. It shows in Collateral all over the place. You get the usual Mann trappings: nighttime city-scapes, overhead helicopter shots, tough guys in light-colored suits, the psychological toll one's profession has on a man, and of course the obligatory three minute quasi-music video while driving but not saying anything (in this case, you'll get Audioslave's ""Shadow on the Sun""). If those sorts of motifs bother you, look past them, because in Collateral you've actually got a pretty interesting story - a hitman who hires a cab to get around L.A. as fast as possible to take out key witnesses, prosecutors, confidential informants, and moles within the drug cartels. It is inventive, even if it stretches the realm of credibility at times. Other than Mann's backdrops, the chemistry between Cruise and Foxx is the real allure of the film. Their interplay is all at once confusing, suppressed, calculated, philosophical, laced with malaise, and as it turns out in the end, somewhat fraternal. Also noteworthy is Mark Ruffalo, who makes brief appearances throughout the film as the only law enforcement officer who pieces together how to engage the duo. Great film if you enjoy Mann's work. Also, don't miss out on his 1995 film ""Heat.""",1492560000,5,1441,5.136170212765958

Music-track overwhelmed or filled in. Although it was a great music.  It's worth a watch for 3.99 on a slow night.

Then we have mark ruffalo as the LAPD detective on the tail of Vincent , and his work is epic , better I think than his Academy Award nominated work as the reporter in Spotlight, which came off a bit shrill. I loved the actress who played Jamie's mom. The scene where mr Fox goes to get the replacement codes from the Mexican drug  Don (Javier Barden )is great . ....Jamie at his best...I didn't care for Jada ..not convincing as a lawyer....nor the nightclub shoot em up scene....I did like the nearly empty LA subway with Cruises dead body on it...going round and round...",1482969600,2,1044,4.494736842105263

1526353,5,B00005JN2Z,"One of Michael Mann's better films (though nearly all of his are excellent).  Jamie Foxx plays an L.A. cab driver who unwittingly picks up a hitman as a fare.  Thus begins his night-long descent into the seedy yet calculated world of a professional assassin-for-hire who makes Foxx's character his unwilling accomplice.  The film takes place almost entirely at night, so the film was shot digitally instead of on film to better capture the action in low light.  L.A. has rarely looked more beautiful or more menacing.  Jada Pinkett Smith, an actress I'm not really a fan of, even comes off rather well in this movie.  I think she was cast perfectly here and does a very fine job.  And for those who think Tom Cruise can't inhabit a character without some ""Movie Star Tom Cruise"" breaking through, this will be the film and performance that changes your mind.",1469923200,,858,4.756756756756757

1526424,5,B00005JN2Z,"Collateral is such a fantastic film.  Michael Mann is brilliant in his direction, the cast is phenomenal, bringing serious life to its characters, and the story is simple, yet exhilarating.

I detest Tom Cruise, but he is amazing in this motion picture, playing Vincent, a hit man who goes all out to complete his mission.  Jamie Foxx was nominated for an Oscar for his performance as Max, a cab driver who unluckily picked up the wrong fare.  Mark Ruffalo is brilliant portraying Fanning, an L.A. Cop who understands a puzzle that no one else can put together.

The story combines first class character building, but combines it with a suspense filled environment which makes Alfred Hitchcock sit on the edge of his coffin.  It's truly unreal.

If you're looking for a great way to spend two hours, and you love suspense, action, and drama, rent this, but this, own this amazing piece of motion picture masterpiece.",1465603200,3,916,4.833333333333333

This movie gets a lot of things right about Los Angeles and Californian life (I live here, so I know) and has some of the best city night photography I have ever seen. This movie features committed performances from its two main stars.
You have never seen Tom Cruise play such a dark character before, and Jamie Foxx was very convincing and relatable as a cab driver. The two have great chemistry together and you wish the would work more often with each other. Both Vincent (Cruise) and Max (Foxx) are well-rounded characters with their own distinct polar-opposite personalities that are very clearly developed.

1526799,5,B00005JN2Z,"Definitely one of the all time classic films by Tom Cruise.  There is really something quite stunning about this movie which I find so intriguing.  It's probably the character Cruise plays to have an appearance of a wolf--the silver hair and stubbly gray beard and slight moustache. Never have I seen him play such a believable villain.  Love the supporting role of Jaime Foxx--now I know why he got a Oscar award for another beautiful film.  His character Max was so very vulnerable that I felt only he could play such a fine role; until the very end when he did ""break free"" and kick ass.  Love that these two characters needed each other for this late night chance meeting--Vincent needing a cabbie to drive him around late night; Max needing Vincent's encouragement to be more self motivating about his own life--it's not enough to dream the dream of having a business; one has to work towards that reality especially since Max felt strongly about having his own limo business.

AWESOME acting from both these two actors. Jada Pinkett-Smith loved her as well.  I've watched this movie a few times, I think film  history will revere it a classic.",1444262400,,1149,4.738693467336684

1527158,3,B00005JN2Z,"Collateral(released Aug/04)stars,among others,Tom Cruise,Jamie Foxx,Jada Pinkett Smith, Mark Ruffalo,Peter Berg and  Bruce McGill. I just didn't know what to think of this film when it ended. It was a bit on the long side and it seemed the sum of its parts just didn't quite gel with its whole.
The story opens as Cruise is at LAX;a Cruise with slightly unkempt pepper coloured hair and beard,wearing a rather bland looking grey suit. He bumps into none other than Jason Statham(in an uncredited cameo),and both simultaneously drop their respective leather bags they carry. Cruise picks up Statham's,and visa versa,and they part.
Enter Foxx,an L.A. cab driver. He has driven for about a dozen years with a personal self dangling carrot;a dream of running a limo service. He picks up Smith who is an attorney working on an important case,and drops her off at her destination. The two strike a chord with each other and she leaves her card with him. At this juncture,in walks Cruise into Foxx's life,and cab. Cruise tells Foxx he has multiple places to go and folks to see and wants to retain his services for an entire evening. Foxx balks at first,but the $700 he will make changes his mind.
As Foxx sits in his cab at the first stop waiting for Cruise's return, a body comes crashing down upon his cab. Cruise appears soon after and both put the body in the cab trunk. Foxx wants out, but Cruise won't let him go. It soon is obvious Cruise is a hitman of sorts and bit by bit his story is slowly revealed to Foxx as the night wears on. The next stop is a crooked attorney who Cruise takes out. The next is the owner of a jazz club,who is iced as the three sit and talk at a table.
Foxx's mother is hospitalized and after repeated calls to his boss,Foxx is forced to make a trip to see her. Cruise tags along and he and Foxx's mother get along quite well. As Cruise is talking Foxx grabs his valice and runs with it. After a chase to a walkway over the highway Foxx tosses the case onto the highway below destroying Cruise's itinerary,computer and money. This forces Cruise to force Foxx into entering a nightclub owned by the very folks who have hired Cruise(having Foxx pretend he is Cruise),in order to re-obtain Cruise's list of hits. There are some pretty tense moments with a p'od crime boss,but Foxx gets the list on a flash drive and returns to the cab.
During all this action the L.A.police have slowly but surely become involved,with all the dead bodies piling up at the morgue. Ruffalo,one of the cops,meets up with an FBI sting operation going down at the last club Cruise and Foxx were at. They I.D. the cab and Foxx,and are now tailing them. At the next point of call Foxx is forced to join Cruise in  a nightclub  while the hit goes down. However the police/FBI are there also and an all out firefight ensues,with the mark taken care of but Ruffalo also going down in a hail of bullets.
Foxx is despondent over the dead cop, and while taking Cruise to the next point of call  he becomes unglued. He deliberately crashes his cab. Cruise manages to escape the scene just as a cop shows up to assist. However the cop discovers the dead body in the trunk and places Foxx under arrest. As he is about to be cuffed Foxx gleans from the rear seat that Cruise's next victim is none other than Smith. Foxx immediately overpowers the cop,steals his gun and grabs a cell phone from a pedestrian. Cruise has already reached the office building Smith is in and Foxx is eventually able to get through and warn her. However Cruise kills all building power and phone lines,and hunts Smith down. Just as he is about to shoot her in walks Foxx,who temporarily disables Cruise. The two escape on to a subway car,with Cruise in pursuit. For a time they are able to keep their distance, but eventually Cruise has them cornered in the last car. Mustering all his courage Foxx,with his gun,steps out into the aisle and starts shooting through the car door at Cruise,who is shooting back. When the smoke clears Foxx is miraculously still standing while Cruise is hit,and hit badly. He slowly takes a seat as Foxx and Smith re enter the car and sit across from him. Cruise asks if anyone will notice a dead man on the subway(a reference to an earlier convo Foxx and Cruise had in the cab).As the subway reaches the next stop,Foxx and Smith get off and walk away,leaving Cruise in the car,dead. Fade to black.
It is about a two hour trip from beginning to end,the film that is,and as I said before,it does not travel quickly. There are a lot of details the director wants to impart such as the ""relationship"" between the hitman and his driver,the police side of the story, which includes not only local cops but the FBI,and little things thrown in such as Foxx's hospitalized mother. I think what made me indecisive about this film one way or another,were exactly that,all the details. I'm a less is more kind of guy,and I think a bit of judicious editing in the script wouldn't have done any harm at all.
Technically speaking the film is in a 2:35:1 w/s a/r and is clear and crisp. This is a TWO disc set.the first disc is the film,of course. The second has all the extras,which includes commentary,featurettes on the making of the film,L.A.at night,a deleted scene and much more.
All in all the film has a good and solid cast,but the film wanders as much as Foxx's cab and I believe it diluted the impact of the film too much. With more editing in the film and script,this could have been one heck of a picture...,i.e. BETTER.3-3 1/2 stars.",1427587200,,5530,4.538076152304609

Upon realizing that Max has become unwittingly an accessory to the crimes being committed and one of the his passengers with whom he became friends with was one of Vincent's target victims,he makes some actions of getting away from this unlikely partnership. This was suspense and action-packed from beginning to end. It was realistic and far from being predictable.

1527818,5,B00005JN2Z,"I've grown weary of all these action thrillers that take place either in New York City or Los Angelas (The Die Hard series is a perfect example).  Here, I'm willing to extend an exception, as the city of L.A. works in the plot's favor rather than the plot just taking place in L.A. for the sake of the plot taking place in L.A.  I especially liked the comment made by Tom Cruise's character in the beginning of the film about how L.A. is too spread out...having been there a couple of times myself, I'm inclined to agree despite the good times I've had there.  But aside from my geographic musings, I very much enjoyed this film.  Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx stole the show.  Each showed a sense of experience in their backgrounds while offering a great insight into one another's lives.  Though the action is minimal in comparison to many, many other thrillers, it's the interaction between these two men that will keep you at the edge of your seat.  The psycological combat continues until the very end (or maybe fifteen seconds before that) and you won't want to miss a moment of it.  Enjoy.",1395792000,3,1092,4.535714285714286
1527819,5,B00005JN2Z,"I remember not knowing much about the movie beforehand. However, when the credits started to roll I realized I had seen a truly entertaining film. Now, having seen it numerous times since, I've really come to appreciate it even more. I had never seen such a stylistic movie made with such authenticity and precision. The way Mann shoots LA at night in grainy digital makes it seem incredibly surreal. Like an odyssey through a urban-dreamscape.

While that may seem like a gimmick, the razor sharp script and Tom Cruise's intense performance as the nihilistic hitman ironically adds depth. Jaime Foxx too. His persona as the humble cab driver feels sincere but almost opposite to the confident entertainer we've seen in the past. The rest of the cast, including Jada Pinkett Smith and Mark Ruffalo, all make most of their time, too.

While the plot in and of itself is nothing new, the execution is so spot on it makes it seem extremely fresh. I have since come to see all of Michael Mann's films. He seems to like common genre but almost always he transforms them into something dynamic. Maybe it resonates with my kinetic personality type but to this day Collateral still holds up as one of my all time favorites. Go rent it!",1395360000,6,1227,4.702325581395349

Some unrealistic scenes, most notably the shoot-out in the club. FBI agents came with many men and helicopters, are (supposedly) everywhere, and armed to the teeth and are nowhere when there is a long clean shot of Vincent, or when he leaves.
Nothing makes sense from the shoot-out on. For example no way they survive that type of 60+ mph crash without fastening their belt. May work in ""Die Hard"" but ""Collateral"" is not meant to be a ""shoot-them-up"" movie where nobody needs to reload...

As for the plot and story line, typical Hollywood dreck focussed on every director's most admired type of person - the highly professional killer.

1528306,4,B00005JN2Z,"I'm sure that taxi drivers meet all kinds of people.  But it is not everyday that you pick up a sociopath, particularly one who is a contract killer.  That is what happens one night for LA cabbie Max (Jamie Foxx), an ordinary guy who dreams of starting his own limo service.  He has the misfortune to pick up Vincent (Tom Cruise), an ex-special forces operator who has come to town in order to assassinate five people.  Vincent is at once charming, philosophical and absolutely devoid of conscience--as the unsuspecting Max discovers when the first stop ends with a corpse crashing down on his cab from above.

Vincent forces Max to drive him from hit to hit.  Out of fear for his life, Max complies, desperately seeking a way out.  Along they way, they develop a relationship of sorts--not a buddy relationship--but a symbiotic one.  Vincent needs Max's driving skill; Max needs Vincent's brazenness to draw him out of his ""nice guy"" shell, so he can put his destiny back into his own hands.

The movie is well-acted.  Foxx is at times sympathetic, and also noble.  Cruise plays the villain perfectly--a complex character that defies stereotypes.  I particularly enjoyed the philosophical musings.  Vincent's worldview might be nihilistic, but he lives consistently with it.  Jada Pinkett Smith is solid as Max's love interest.  Mark Ruffalo, always memorable, has a small part--I wish his role would have been expanded some.

The blu-ray transfer is good.  Virtually the entire movie takes place at night, so most scenes involve low lighting.  Despite this, the film grain is not too noticeable.  Detail is good.  The sound was fine.

Parental Advisory: This movie is rated R for several scenes involving strong violence.  It is also punctuated at times with strong language.

I recommend this movie for mature movie watchers.  While the violence is visceral at times, director Michael Mann has given us a glimpse into the heart of darkness--a man devoid of conscience who acts consistently with his worldview.  Pitting him against an ""every man"" makes for some interesting interactions.  How far would you be willing to go in order to stop evil?",1355097600,6,2148,4.963483146067416

This is an acting TOUR DE FORCE between CRUISE and FOX. Their chemistry together is GREAT. This is one of the BEST performances ever by TOM CRUISE--he is, absolutely, CONVINCING and TERRIFYING as a COLD BLOODED SOCIOPATH. INTENSITY guides this story. Certainly one of the best Micheal Mann (director) movies. This movie is very much character driven and the dialogue is great, but there is also MASSIVE ACTION. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

I listened to those rumors and innuendo for years and and did not view his work. About 5 years ago I saw one of his movies and it totally changed me.

1528311,4,B00005JN2Z,"Tom Cruise should do more villain roles.  I find him inherently unlikable to begin with, so being the heavy in a story should be second nature to him.  And playing ice-cold hitman Vincent in Michael Mann's stunning thriller COLLATERAL, Cruise is at his gruesome best.  The story is original, and it's a beaut:  For one dark night in LA, Vincent ""borrows"" a cab and its driver, Max (one of Jamie Foxx's best roles, in my humble opine), to make five different stops to kill four thugs and one prosecutor (Jada Pinkett Smith) who have sold out the mob.  The dialogue inside the cab makes this movie, as Vincent's no-nonsense style forces Max to come to grips with the facade that is his life--and forces Max to make a life-or-death decision that will have lasting consequences.

Mann is a sensational director, and he brings to the screen a gritty, brutal tale, with a seedy LA becoming a character all its own.  The action sequences, particularly in the nightclub, are nothing short of stellar.  Cruise is in serious physical shape to play this role, and it shows; Vincent is one nasty hombre.  Mark Ruffalo turns in a solid performance playing a cop who ultimately ends up a day late and a dollar short.  The climactic sequences at the prosecutor's office that move to the public transit are also well done, but this is where the movie stumbles just a bit; it's way, way over the top.  Yet that aspect didn't take away from my total enjoyment of COLLATERAL.  This shoot-'em-up is one grand white-knuckle seat squirmer.

This is an extraordinary movie. The plot is taut and fast-paced, the dialog clever, the characters exceptionally acted, with touches of philosophy.

The only flaw is occasionally imperfect logic. Specifically, the cabdriver did have a chance to get away and call the police half-way through. Why didn't he? He could have warned the police of the danger to his mother.",1352160000,,412,5.323076923076923

This movie is very different. It's got two great actors, and a pretty original plot. The suspense level in this movie off the charts. The thing that sold it for me is the dialogue. The conversations between the two characters are deep and very real. Even though this movie has some good points, it failed to captivate me. There's just something missing that makes a movie a classic. I can't say exactly what it is that this movie lacks, but it certainly needs a little more of it.

1528408,5,B00005JN2Z,"Leave it to Michael Mann to create classy, intelligent thrillers. At a time when most thrillers forsake characterization and genuine suspense for car chases and repetitive gun fights, it's refreshing to see directors like Mann take the action genre seriously as an art form. Mann has given us the terrific ""Heat"" and ""The Insider""; now joining that pair is ""Collateral"", which ranks as Mann's third major contribution to the thriller genre.

Set between 6:30pm to 5:40am in Los Angeles, ""Collateral"" stars a mesmerizing Tom Cruise as Vincent, a contract killer hired by a drug cartel to eliminate four witnesses and a prosecutor before the break of dawn. To get the job done, Vincent forces an innocent cab driver named Max (Jamie Foxx in a masterfully subtle performance) to chauffeur him on his murder spree.

It is a stroke of genius for Mann to cast Cruise in a villainous role. Even in his best movies, there was always something bothersome about Cruise's arrogance, his amoral mechanism that can be seen in ""Top Gun"" and ""A Few Good Men"". Here, Mann skillfully uses Cruise's trademark cockiness to create a chilling character. As Vincent, Cruise reveals the nihilism and coldness in his killer, one who belittles others (particularly Foxx) for their staid but decent existence, mocking them for their inability translate their eloquence into a better life. Cruise's interplay with Foxx is the heart of the picture, especially when Cruise indirectly forces Foxx to stop lying to himself, to stop pretending to think that his temporary job is guaranteed to lead him to a future in limousine service. Foxx deservedly won the Best Supporting Actor nomination as Vincent's foil, especially in the pivotal car speeding scene where he transforms from a likable but impotent cab driver to a strong hero who rebels against Vincent's philosophies.

The real star in ""Collateral"" is Los Angeles. Rarely has Los Angeles looked more decadent than in ""Collateral"". The helicopter shots of the roaming freeways, the skylines, the barren streets akin to a ghost town, all present Los Angeles as a city losing its way as a civilized metropolis. The scene where three coyotes cross the streets says it all: beneath the veneer of Los Angeles' civilized society lies a cold savagery that lurks behind every corner.

And for fans hungry for some action, there are two excellent action sequences that'll whet your appetite. The first is the shootout in the nightclub where the FBI is hot on Vincent and Max's trails. The second is the climatic chase scene where Max has to save the last target from Vincent. Both action scenes are edited to achieve a relentless pace and propel narrative momentum. One minor quibble would be that Max's attempt to save the last target would be best reserved for another movie but it at least provides a chance for Max to act like a hero after being forced to become Vincent's chauffeur for the first 80-90 minutes of the movie.

Michael Mann's ""Collateral"" is a beautifully crafted, terrifically acted and immensely entertaining thriller that stimulates the mind and rattles the emotion. Like ""Heat"", this movie rewards upon multiple viewings so anyone that missed the meanings can watch it again to find them. ""Collateral"" is a triumph and one of the best movies of 2004.

1528488,4,B00005JN2Z,"Beautifully shot and artfully polysemic, Collateral is an enjoyable and expertly crafted film. Although it has the dressings of an action thriller, it is more of a sensitive character study. Max (played by Jaime Foxx), a reserved cab driver, is fatefully paired with an uncaring assassin, Vincent (played by Tom Cruise), and the film shows us the inevitable clash of their personalities.

After inadvertently divulging the nature of his violent vocation, Vincent forces Max (sometimes at gun point) to drive him around for the night. Listening to and watching their interactions with each other is endlessly entertaining. Max slowly assimilates some of Vincent's traits, some of his boldness; but he also recognizes that Vincent is ""missing something"" that most humans possess (a conscience of some kind). This relationship is the core of the movie and is handled masterfully.

The city of Los Angeles, where the film is set, is another important character. Mann deftly captures the feel of the city, using tasteful overhead shots to provide a sense of location.

The film, however, is not without its flaws. There is a clunky boy/girl story and the denouement is painfully protracted and clumsily written, providing no real satisfaction.

This film for me is 4 out of 5 only because I don't own it. I saw it in the Cinema 3 times fast. Fast because time does fly when you're having fun. I rented the film as soon as it was released on DVD and I rented the Double Disk Edition that is available here on Amazon. I viewed the film both as per usual as well as with the Directors Commentary Feature. I then viewed the additional materials on the other disk that showed some of the making of the feature as well as little inside scoops on the training Sir Thomas Cruise Mapother III (Tom Cruise) went through, or should I say 'endured' in the name of creating this masterplay of motion picture. Before I continue, I would like to point out that I am being careful not to give any information away that could tell you about the important threads and currents throughout the film that I think you would be best discovering yourself from ensuring you partake in your own viewing pleasure of it. However, for those of you who have seen the film already or are wanting a deeper insight before watching it, I do have a page that explains the film in great detail and a simple search of my obscure name pertaining to things of a lock & key nature will immediately draw up my film explanations website as a first result. Tom Cruise stars as Vincent The Assassin, a philosophical hitman with a chip on his shoulder and a haircut to pay a hundred bucks for and a suit to sell your car for. He is chiseled into a humanoid picturesque walking, talking, breathing upright version of a Wild Grey Wolf. Many Acting Aficionados claim that his character is from a Method Acting perspective strongly rooted in the animal's demeanor and appearance. As Vincent, he kidnaps Max who is an LA cab driver played by Jamie Foxx. He is smooth, charming, slick and graceful and he makes things he does that are disgraceful seem like a loaded barrel full of fun. There are many stand out moments and entire scenes that become a poignant memory. Michael Mann, who directs this beautiful motion picture manages to capture essences of Los Angeles and Urban Life like Peter Parker catches photographs of Spiderman. Michael, much like Peter, knows how to do this all too well, because Michael is Urban Life and Peter IS Spiderman. No one captures spider better than spider can. And this film captures those so many subtle threads of Corporate Reality and the Pursuit of Happiness. Max, the cab driver, reminds me of Will Smith in the aforementioned feature where he is trying to become financially free and is working his way up the entrepreneur / sales person's jacob ladder. In this film however, it's an even more typical dream, Max simply wants to move up from being a cab driver to being a limo driver. But after being kidnapped by Vincent The Cold Blooded Killer Assassin from a place worse than hell and possibly more beautiful at the same time - will he even make it through the night? Watch Collateral to learn harsh lessons without having to go through harsh hardships to get there.

1528546,5,B00005JN2Z,"There is a bit of ""street philosophy"" between the two main characters, Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx, that I found actually quite important to me and have thought about as reference points repeatedly since seeing this movie... Judge for yourself on that count, but it does at least hint at possible reasons for a kind of callous disregard for life that Tom's ""Silver Fox"" character, as Tom describes his character, shows us; and in contrast you have Jamie Foxx who, in the movie, is perplexed, surprised and bewildered at Tom's hardness as a hit man. Yet watch as this observation by Jamie molds his own behavior and character. Another stand out specific was a scene where Jamie Fox, the taxi cab driver, is stuck in a very vulnerable spot with skinhead hardcore street punks, ...and then what happens next has a kind of sudden impact, as Tom Cruise, hit man extraordinaire, arrives and ""rights"" things. Usually it's a visually striking image that grabs the eye into entertainment enlightenment, but this scene has both visual and audio impact. So I watched this full scale assault of a scene again and again because it was so well done. There is another shocker of a scene (a hit) that is so up close, intimately personal, and it incorporates a violent change of mood, emotion and human connection that adds a kind of heart felt pathos that may only be matched again by the end of the movie on the rail car. Watch how a strange and dynamic relationship develops between Foxx and Cruise, one mixed with revulsion, respect and even a kind of teacher relationship with Cruise as the teacher, not to mention his last line of the movie which is really a key commentary of our collective cold culture of which Cruise mastered to full effect and profit for as long as his ride took him.",1306972800,3,1776,4.659235668789809

Cruise's role is a hit man trying to take out multiple targets in a single evening, who hijacks a cab driven by Jamie Foxx.

Apparently the critics weren't ready to see Cruise playing a psychopathic professional killer, because the film got mixed reviews and a lukewarm reception from the audience.

I love the film and admire Cruise for having the guts to take a role so far against type for him.  He absolutely nails it!

Foxx matches him stride-for-stride as the cab driver with the big dreams who finds himself still driving a cab 12 years later.  The arc of his character, and the subtlety Foxx brings to the progression, are amazing.  His character's turning point in the movie is one of the most compelling moments I've seen on celluloid.

The action elements fly off the screen too.

The film was shot mostly at night in hi-def video, and bluray transfer is generally regarded as one of the best ever.  Ditto the soundtrack.  This is probably why the bluray price is holding above $15 for so lon.

R-rated for startling and graphic -- not gruesome -- violence, and language, and deservedly so.

There is very little back story to Cruise's character and what there is may be just a joke. This fits the character well. We don't want to know who he is and he would probably lie anyway.

The story gets a bit jumbled, for me at least, in the middle. Who is Cruise killing ? Are they bad guys or witnesses ? They give the impression of bad guys, maybe rivals of his clients. Then, at the end, we learn they are witnesses and, presumably, good guys. Well, you don't watch such moves for plot subtleties.

The L.A. scenery is used very well as the backdrop for the criminal activity. There is a wonderfully choreographed nightclub scene that is a sort of ballet of violence.

1528598,5,B00005JN2Z,"Very few movies made in the last 10 years possess a certain ""charm"" to them that make me want to watch them again and again. Collateral is one of them! Cruise plays a slick, fearless hitman who oozes of confidence and charm, while Foxx is just a decent, regular guy. Both actors give fantastic performances and make this flick really fun to watch. Cruise's character, while ruthless and amoral, is intelligent, charming and quick-thinking. And he's a jazz music buff to boot! One of his marks is a noted local jazz trumpet player, and Vincent (Cruise) makes it a point to have Max drive him to the jazz club early enough to enjoy the trumpet player's performance, and even buy the musician a drink and talk about Miles Davis, before doing him in. Talk about a great script...just when you think Vincent is softening up a bit and deciding to bag his work for the evening, BAM! It's obvious he's not opposed to knocking off anyone, no matter how much he likes them! Somehow, though, it's hard NOT to like Vincent, he's just so cool in his own way. What's troubling about liking him (aside from the obvious fact that he's a vicious killer, of course) is that since Max knows that he's doing all of this killing, Vincent is going to have to knock him off, too, before the night is over. As others have noted, great character development!

Foxx's character (Max) is understandably freaked out when the trouble first begins, but rises to the occasion more and more as the story evolves. Even though the two characters are completely different, the chemistry between the two is nevertheless quite entertaining. The way Max borrows tough-guy one-liners from Vincent when his own ""tough"" gets going is also quite amusing!

1528601,5,B00005JN2Z,"Movie - 4.5

I'd only seen this movie once some odd years ago when it first came out on DVD. My mother had rented it, but my attention span and train of thought were so much different than it is now and I never really got into it. Since then, I've developed a greater appreciation for film-making in the way a movie is produced, who's cast in the roles, and especially the way it's written. After sitting down a few months ago to finally watch the entirety of Heat, I discovered the gritty magic of one Michael Mann for the first time. Needless to say, he strikes another excellent effort in Collateral. Unlike Heat with its extensive run time and extremely fleshed-out characters, Collateral is surprisingly spectacular in that it manages to achieve almost the same effect, but with a shorter, more truncated time frame. From the get-go we're thrown into the ""world"" known as Los Angeles where disconnect and sprawl are the very fabric of this bustling, yet sad city, in which we meet Max (Jamie Foxx), who unknowingly will have his life changed forever within the next few hours. Enter Vincent (Tom Cruise), who does the changing in cold, calculated, and stylized fashion. Spoilers aside, this is a movie that illustrates many a good point about life in general. L.A. represents the void that is our lives, Max is the everyman who just can't over the hump in that void, and Vincent symbolizes aspiration, change, and adaptation to counteract it all. The script, acting, and screenplay are amazing, thanks in huge part to the chemistry and acting abilities of Cruise, Foxx, Pinkett Smith, and even Ruffalo. It's a film that shows how even the most polar opposite of personalities can somehow come together through all the crap in the world, if not for one night, and create something that will stay with them for the rest of their lives and break them out of a rut.

Video - 4.5

With a good 85% of the film being shot in HD, Collateral looks excellent all things considered. Colors aren't too vibrant, and there's a fair amount of noise throughout. But if you take into account that pretty much the whole movie takes place either in the dark or in dimly-lit locales, it's understandable.  Black levels are still rich, detail is fine, and the contrast never wavers, even in the darkest of scenes. I was especially impressed with the techniques they used in filming the cab scenes to get all the camera angles.  As dark and dim as it really is inside a cab, the clarity is actually quite striking.  What few scenes there are with lighting have a gritty sheen to them as well.  When you actually put some light on Foxx and Cruise, colors look much better, flesh tones more natural, and details a great deal sharper, particularly in Cruise's stubble and hair texture.  Overall, the look of the film itself makes for a very nice transfer.  Aesthetically it's not something you could showcase as being reference, but it's a commendable job by Paramount, nonetheless.

Audio - 4.5

The DTS-HD 5.1 track doesn't amount to much in the beginning, as a lot of the movie is dialogue-heavy, at least until Vincent is introduced. Dialogue, by the way, is crisp and clear emanating through the center channel with no traces of dropout or distortion. However when Vincent starts doing his work, the sound field becomes much more thoroughly engaged. General sound effects like walking on the pavement, the taxi doors, radio calls, and background noise are all very buoyant. Music does an adequate job coming from the front sides as well and adds a good deal of sporadic immersion to keep you engrossed. All of these elements are fine and dandy, but it's the wallop of gunshots amongst the chaos that really give the system a workout later on. As far as I'm concerned, the audio for how it's used in the movie is a perfect transfer.  As a BD, though, I just wish the side speakers got a little more usage and that LFEs were more frequent.

Extras - 4.0

While the making-of featurette is interesting, the real star of the extras is the exceedingly informative commentary by director Michael Mann. Mann does a stellar job explaining technical terms of how he filmed the movie, fills in some of the information gaps of the characters and their backgrounds, and then delves into the symbolism of their actions and presence. It serves as a great compliment to the narrative of the film itself and really has the ability to raise one's appreciation for the overall work. The making-of featurette elaborates a little on what Mann mentions in the commentary, only with pictures and video. I actually liked the bit with Cruise's training sessions a lot and found it to be a testament to how good of an actor he is (personal issues aside). However, I did find some of the making-of stuff to be a little repetitious of what Mann said already, leaving a little more to be desired. The commentary, though, is a must-listen for fans of the movie.

Overall - 4.5

Collateral is an extremely well-constructed action/drama/thriller.  It's a film that offers a good dose of grit and realism through a very charismatic Tom Cruise and equally subtle Jamie Foxx. It's a story that sort of goes against modern conventions with its truncated time frame of a narrative, but regardless, manages to tell a very entertaining story about two seemingly opposite strangers in a ""world"" where feeling unfulfilled is the norm, and then clashing their ideals into something more worthwhile. Presented by Paramount with near-reference A/V quality and an informative set of extras, Collateral comes highly recommended.",1271289600,7,5568,4.783333333333333

1528673,5,B00005JN2Z,"Like good jazz Collateral is able to quietly move into your head before washing you away in an ocean of smooth chaos.  A tale of two men from two separate backgrounds meet one night in this dreary character-study in a night that will leave both changed forever.  The movie begins with a shady character exchanging briefcases in an airport.  Afterward we are suddenly thrown into a seemingly separate movie.  We are now transported into the life of taxi driver Max Durocher (Jamie Foxx), a gentle, soft-spoken man with big ambitions.  He meets a U.S. Justice Department prosecutor by the name of Annie Farrell (Jada Pinkett Smith) who needs a ride.  Not one to pass a pretty lady by he stops for her and shares a moving exchange of words; not Hollywood flirting, but natural conversation that shows two people connecting in a way few people are capable.

After dropping the prosecutor off Max receives another passenger...  Vincent (Tom Cruise) is a grey haired, grey suit wearing man whose natural charm is radiant.  He requests that Max take him on five stops to visit some friends and to get him back to LAX airport by the end.  Max cites regulation, but when Vincent flashes six crisp hundred dollar bills he decides to make an exception.  But after the first drop off Vincent's profession is made clear when a corpse falls atop Max's cab.  Unable to escape Max is taken along for the ride as Vincent continues his job with professional precision.

In this journey both men will learn from each other in this trek through the underbelly of Los Angeles.

Director Michael Mann has created a tight thriller with equally award-worthy performances from his two leading men.  This isn't a crime movie with good guys and bad guys.  Collateral is a movie about people who do what is natural to them and actually have feelings.  Cruise is not some sort of post-Tarantino hit man who talks casually like the job is no big deal.  He operates with expert precision and knows the requirements of his job, but he doesn't do it out of pleasure, or amusement.  No, Vincent does it because killing is his job...but he never seems to enjoy his line of work.  His charisma and enthusiasm reflects that of the taxi driver played by Jamie Foxx who has been stuck in his boring job for twelve years and as such as a soft, kind speaking tone, but he lets people walk all-over him.  Both characters have something to learn from the other and that only makes their conversations more compelling to an audience.

Mann drives a tight movie which explores the bad along with the good of each of its characters.  The violence is swift and sudden and will take an audience's breath away, but most of the film's brilliance is within its dialogue.  The final action scenes are well filmed and suspenseful, but I was left wishing for more conversations between Max and Vincent.  A film like this is a mixed bag in this aspect seeing as it seemed incapable of deciding on action, thriller, or drama.  The action and thriller aspects of it are good, but what makes this film great is entirely rested in the performances of Cruise and Foxx.

1528675,4,B00005JN2Z,"What separates Michael Mann's ""Collateral"" from most other crime thrillers is that you actually have characters that you enjoy and, more importantly, understand. To see Tom Cruise as an ice-in-his-blood hitman, which is way more than casting against type, is something to behold. And Jamie Foxx as an unwilling accomplice is superb. And Los Angeles, as an unwilling third character, is hypnotic. (The scene where three coyotes cross a main L.A. drag is almost artsy, but extremely effective, as it questions the distinction [or lack thereof] between civilization and wilderness.)

I agree with most reviewers that some of coincidences are farfetched, and that the ending is a little too much like other thrillers, especially ""Speed"". Still, the movie held my attention thanks to the peppery dialogue between Cruise and Foxx. What disappointed me, besides the logistical leaps in the plot, were the ""gimmes"".

1528679,5,B00005JN2Z,"This movie has real class, the photography, shot with the viper hi-def camera, is amazing and adds a depth of escapism that I have only found elsewhere in Michael Mann's Miami Vice, shot with the same camera. The colours and the vibrancy of the Los Angeles dusk just made me feel ""there"" in a way I can't put my finger on, and combined with the score to create a world I enjoyed losing myself in.

 Tom Cruise is looking sharp in an all grey suit, tie and hair combo and brings an air of intensity and offbeat Tyler Durden style to his role, espousing the same ""live life in the moment and destroy all those pedestrian parts of yourself that hold you back"" philosophies in between murdering his targets in emphatic fashion. The guy looks good, and carries the main drive of the movie, along with the photography and the music.

 Jamie Foxx does a great job of the supporting actor role, and the storyline is a tightly scripted realisation of a good concept: a foreign assassin turns up in LA to carry out five hits between sun-down and sun-up before leaving again never to be seen or heard from, strong-arming a hapless cab driver into being his personal chauffeur for the duration of the operation, or so the plan goes.

 Watch out for the completely unscripted and impromptu appearance of a wild dog strolling out in front of the car at a light (the camera just happened to be rolling), it's a special movie moment, and really captures the essence of ""being there"", witnessing life as it unfolds, and all that jazz.

1528680,5,B00005JN2Z,"COLLATERAL, for my money, is one of the best films of the decade. Most modern films have a ""sameness"" about them. Regardless of genre, they all seem ""the same"". There tends to be too much focus on ""wow-ing the moviegoer"" with growing technology (CGI, special effects), gimmickry (tricky plots, flashbacks, surprise endings), and not enough focus on character development and dialogue. Another thing that I think a lot of today's movies lack is ""realistic character interaction"". Somehow, COLLATERAL overcomes all the cliches found in many modern films and rises to the level of poetry. Directed by the great filmmaker Michael Mann (THIEF, MANHUNTER, HEAT, THE INSIDER, and a personal shout-out to his groundbreaking 80s TV series MIAMI VICE), COLLATERAL is an absorbing, atmospheric, provocative tale of two men who meet at the literal crossroads of their lives.

A mystery man named Vincent (played with 100% utter conviction and ease by the legendary Tom Cruise) arrives at LAX and ""accidentally"" bumps into another man, in which a briefcase exchange ensues. Vincent travels to downtown LA and gets in a cab driven by Max (Jamie Foxx in a performance that would earn him a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination). Vincent tasks Max to drive him around LA to complete his ""errands"". Max soon finds out (the hard way!) that Vincent is a contract killer. Vincent is going to kill 5 people that night and Max must drive him around or else!

During this night, Vincent and Max learn valuable lessons about each other and themselves. In a series of stimulating conversations, some very truthful facts of life are laid out for the viewer to absorb and consider. One can see Vincent and Max literally transfer personality traits to each other as the night ensues, which leads to an inevitable conclusion. Every time I watch the film, I pick up on a detail or nuance about Vincent and Max I hadn't seen or noticed before and am amazed at how believable their interaction is and how meticulous a film that Michael Mann has constructed. This film ought to easily be considered one of the best of the decade.

Within this fascinating film, Mann mixes in a great soundtrack, superbly staged and convincing action sequences, and beautiful cinematography of LA after dark. The excellent supporting cast includes Mark Ruffalo (as Det. Fanning hot on Vincent and Max's tail), Barry Shabaka Henley (as nightclub owner Daniel, who the men have an interesting encounter with), Irma P. Hall (as Max's mom, who almost steals the movie!), Javier Bardem (in a pitch perfect scene as the big bad guy Felix), and last but not least an incredibly vibrant and sexy Jada Pinkett Smith (as an early fare of Max's who ends up being a key to the story).

I cannot stress or say enough of how impressed I was with Tom Cruise's amazing work in this film. It is as much a physical performance as it is a verbal one. And he handles both sides with aplomb. How he did not get nominated for an Oscar (Best Actor) is beyond belief! I would have settled for him getting a ""nomination"", but, I swear, everytime I watch this flawless film, I continue to believe that this is THE performance that Mr. Cruise should always be remembered for, leaving all his other great work in the dust! This may be the best performance of his career, and it is thankfully part of a truly great film.

I own this 2-disc set dvd and it is perfect, the way every dvd of a big film should be with great quality on the film dvd and interesting, refreshing commentary on the 2nd one. A masterpiece as far as I'm concerned!",1259193600,2,3559,4.74313408723748

Max (Jamie Foxx) is one of a thousand cab drivers in the city. He keeps his cab squeaky clean during his night shift, he knows his streets and his signals, and he always reaches his passengers' destinations in time. He's been driving a cab for 12 years, but he's got some big dreams. He wants to own a limo company, and is only comfortable talking about it to those who look like they would never laugh their butts off at him. One of these people is a prosecutor named Annie Farrell (Jada Pinkett Smith). She gives him her card after a drive to the Justice Department, and Max can't decide at the moment if he wants to call her later or not. What comes next is something that is completely unexpected.

The next passenger in Max's cab is a man named Vincent (Tom Cruise). He looks to be a business man, with a clean gray suit and a luxurious-looking briefcase. Vincent makes a deal with Max: make five stops for the night and he'll give the driver 600 dollars total. Max hesitates, and slowly accepts the offer. At the first stop, the cab is parked in the alley of an apartment building where the first stop is located. Vincent enters the building, while Max takes his time eating a deli sandwich and examining photos of automobiles, which probably gives him motivation for his ""big dream"". With the exception of the radio, everything is silent . . . until a dead body crashes on the top of the taxi. Seeing the broken window on top of the apartment building, and Vincent returning with no look of shock on his face, Max discovers . . .

Max: ""You killed him?!""
Vincent: ""No, I shot him. The bullets and the fall killed him.""

Max has become the driver for a hitman who has been contracted to kill five people in one night.

""Collateral"" is a movie that focuses on these two men of extreme differences. Vincent is a cold-blooded killer who does what he sets out to do, and if something happens, he decides to ""improvise"" and ""adapt"" if the change is either unstoppable or too abrupt. Max, on the other hand, does not use improvisation. He plans everything from the start with no distractions, hoping to fulfill his dreams of owning his own limo company that he's puting up. Vincent never loved L.A.; Max is comfortable living in the city. Vincent loves Jazz; Max does not. And so on. These two men find themselves questioning each other's motives and beliefs, which leads to an ultimate confrontation in the end.

The city of Los Angeles becomes an important ""character"" in the film. The foggy nights, the city lights, the unavoidable crime, the towering skyline, everything looks beautiful. Director Michael Mann has really captured the look and feel of L.A. in an almost perfect way. The digital cinematography makes it all worthwhile.

Cruise, Foxx, Pinket Smith, and Ruffalo make a fine acting ensemble. Even though I'm not a big fan of Cruise, I'd say that this is a big surprise. Here he is not seen as a hero, but a villain. He is a cold-blooded contract killer who knows how to properly use a gun. But the truth is, you don't know if you should love or hate Vincent. Aside from the story of his parents, we don't know much about his past, and what drove him to this path. I could say that he does have a heart, but his job is what shatters that statement. Foxx manages to play the part of the average guy very well. He finds himself in a hazardous situation, and he doesn't know what will happen to him when it's over. He should've won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, but his win for ""Ray"" clearly makes up for it. Pinkett Smith's role is smaller in the film, but it is influential in that she becomes part of Vincent's questioning of Max's life. She is a fine actress, and she never misses a beat here. Ruffalo may be a bit off at times, but he is still believable as the Detective who starts to see that the killings may be linked to something more serious. I never realized it was Javier Bardem who played Felix until I saw ""No Country for Old Men."" He looks and sounds creepy here, but not as creepy as Chigurh.

This is one of my favorite movies in general. The atmosphere of Los Angeles, the acting of Cruise and Foxx, and the music (kudos to Audioslave, Paul Oakenfold, and James Newton Howard) are just few of the reasons for the admiration. This is yet another film (along with The Godfather 1 & 2, No Country for Old Men, Terminator 2, 2001: A Space Odyssey, etc.) that I'll never get tired of watching repeatedly.

1528755,4,B00005JN2Z,"If you are looking for action, Suspense and Tom Cruise as a bad guy! Than you have found the perfect 120 min movie to watch. While not as good As Heat, this smart action thriller presents a different kind of movie; one that actually feels a bit different. Michael Mann this time brings a unique camera work that mixes documentary style with digital...it's kind of hard to describe, but it works, it gives the film a sort of ""independent"" filmmaking look. Unfortunately Mann would use this exact same technique on ""Miami Vice"" in which it looks atrocious.

Collateral begins with Max (Jaime Foxx) a Taxi Driver who is working on changing his usual routine and perhaps one day establishes his own ""Limo"" company. Max's daily routine changes when he picks up Vincent (Tom Cruise) a hit man that kidnaps Max. Vincent needs Max to drive him around, take him where his victims are. I will not spoil more, but I must say that this flick will leave you plugged until the last minute. The best scene is a shootout in a club; it's so amazingly well shot. Not to mention also the music that plays in the background, superb

The only real reason I don't give this movie a ""5"" is because of the ending. The ending kind of kills it, and exaggerates Vincent's ability, making him look like a Terminator. I am not gona go into details as to what it is that makes it exaggerating, but you will see what I mean. Another thing I would like to add is Tom Cruise's acting; it is by far his best in any of his movies. I have seen almost all of Tom's movies and I have to mention that this is the first time he has played a villain, and very well I might add...he should have won or at least been nominated for an award. Anyway, this is a must have by all movie aficionados.

Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx are the stars of the film, Foxx winning an Academy Award. No offense to him, but I found Cruise better. He was just outstanding in here as the immoral hit-man. Foxx was entertaining, too, as the nerd-ish cab driver who is pulled into Cruise's murdering adventures.

You'll appreciate both of these guys, and the great visuals, more on the second viewing after you are familiar with the story. The intense film is definitely worth more than one look.

The movie starts with Vincent (Tom Cruise) arriving to L.A., a guy who just looks perfect...

Some people happen to people on purpose, in order to tell them something about their lives...And they sit somewhere and share two or three lines, and they leave, and you know, your life is changed...

When Max (Jamie Foxx) first meets Vincent, it was ""who cares? He was a dreamer when he said: ""I just saw the woman of my dreams...I'm getting married in my mind right now.""

1528759,4,B00005JN2Z,"It's a shame they don't make more movies like ""Collateral.""

Then again, there aren't many filmmakers as talented as Michael Mann, a perpetually slick stylist, a connoisseur of cool in all its forms. It's generally accepted that his masterpiece was 1995's ""Heat,"" the epitome of filmic cool. But in ""Collateral,"" he makes a movie nearly as good by stretching himself and showing us something new. While ""Heat"" had a lot of warmth in the peripheral human drama, at its cold cold heart was the cool vs. cool of DeNiro and Pacino. But here we have something different--cool vs. nerd.

The nerd in question is Max, a big-dreaming, small-living cab driver and perpetual momma's boy, played with remarkable precision and ability by Jaime Foxx. In a few brief scenes, Mann sketches out his life as an endless banal mush peppered only lightly with missed-and-moped-over opportunities. That is, until Vincent steps into his cab. Tom Cruise's character seems little more than a sharp-dressed man offering a very simple deal to Max: work all night, make five stops, get to the airport by 6:00 am, and earn 700 dollars.

Of course, easy money never is; it soon becomes clear that Vincent is a hitman, a slick samurai of sorts who remains unruffled by anything the world can throw his way. On the surface he seems like no more than another of Mann's uber-cool leading men dressed, like so many of the director's cool killers, in a suit and no tie. And at first, there's a good deal of fun to be had watching him try to coach Max into coolness through sheer force of ego and personality. Confrontations with the boss, friction with mother--Max seems overtaxed by such simple everyday trials, until Vincent steps up to show him how to sail through such situations with ease. But there's a decided uncoolness that emerges in Cruise's character as the night unfolds--unlike DeNiro's character in ""Heat,"" who shows a certain nobility and a reluctance to do the immoral even in the midst of the illegal, Vincent is pure evil clad in Armani, a smooth-talking sophist with no visible conscience. When Max complains that the hitman just killed a total stranger, he asks, with an awesome mix of incredulity and condescenscion, ""What, I should only kill people after I get to know them?""

The script and the action are great, and the DVD extras aren't bad, if you're into that sort of thing--they offer a good look at the perfectionism and artistic process of an incredible director, although for me that can be bittersweet, like watching a magician reveal his tricks. But most importantly, the characters are fleshed out and interesting and real. As the movie and the night progress, they ricochet off one another in increasingly uncontrolled fashion, penned up, for the most part, in their claustrophobic cab, while the tension steadily escalates--it's almost like ""Rear Window"" on wheels. And yet despite that physical proximity, there's a moral chasm than neither man can cross. While ""Heat"" showed us a cop and robber who were astonishingly similar, who were inexorably drawn to one another in the course of a drama that sprawled like L.A. itself, this gives us a tight little movie with two men destined to repel one another despite their proximity. It's the opposite dynamic, but nearly as unforgettable--and that's pretty cool.",1233014400,,3311,4.92831541218638

He often focuses on minute but important aspects of both the story and the characters therein, which has earned him the reputation of being an ""actor's director"". This unique interaction between Mann and his cast is exemplified in the suspense film, Collateral, which features an impressive cast of actors, all of whom give naturalistic and psychologically complex performances. The story, about a cab driver who is forced to drive a hitman around the city of Los Angeles while he assassinates his targets, is quite literally driven by its vividly realized characters. These characters, who are three-dimensional and feel almost familiar, are brought to life by an all-star cast. The cast includes Tom Cruise as Vincent, Jamie Foxx as Max, Jada Pinkett Smith as Annie, and Mark Ruffalo as Detective Fanning. Each member of the cast gives a great performance, especially Jada Pinkett Smith and Mark Ruffalo, who aren't what would be considered the main characters and yet they create memorable personas. But the real scene-stealers are the performances of Foxx and Cruise, whose characters are dynamic despite being polar opposites.

Vincent is a slickly dressed, cold and calculating hitman, who has buried his emotions for years in order to make himself a more efficient killer. Max is an obsessive-compulsive, perfectionist of a cabdriver, who has allowed his lifelong dreams to slip by because he lacks the confidence and the initiative to make them a reality. But on one fateful night, these two strangers' lives will collide and neither will be the same.
When Vincent asks Max if he will drive him around the city while he makes five stops, Max is at first hesitant and unsure... until Vincent offers him $700. But during their first stop, while Vincent is inside of an apartment complex, a body falls from the balcony and comes crashing down onto the roof of Max's cab. It immediately becomes clear that Vincent has killed the man and Max knows that he has now essentially become a hostage. As Max is forced to drive Vincent to his remaining stops while Vincent assassinates his targets, the two share conversations and begin to see each other for who and what they truly are. This has an effect on the both of them, though a different effect. As Max becomes more assertive and confident, Vincent is reintroduced to his more human side. Meanwhile a narcotics detective named Fanning is tracking down Vincent because he knows that someone's responsible for the deaths of certain witnesses for the prosecution of a major drug trafficker named Felix. And it is Felix that has hired Vincent to eliminate these witnesses. It's not long before the FBI becomes involved and they believe that Max is the killer, not Vincent who they don't even know exists.
Soon Max is angered by Vincent's general disregard for life and he is empowered by the realization that he does have some control over what happens to him. When Max discovers that Vincent's final target is a beautiful criminal prosecutor named Annie, who Max had befriended earlier in the evening, Max is forced to race Vincent to save her. Max, the passive cabbie is pitted against Vincent, the sociopathic contract killer. Yet on this night anything can happen.

Collateral gave Michael Mann the unique opportunity of shooting a film in Los Angeles after dark and he delighted in showing audiences a side to the city that they may not have known existed before. Using, predominantly, a Hi Def digital camera, he creates a vision of Los Angeles that is simultaneously stark, oppressive, beautiful, and colorful. Mann also exposes the economic differences and the cultural diversity of L.A., which gives the film a different flavor from other films that have shot there.
Though highly stylized and at times a little predictable, Collateral is one of the best suspense films of the past decade. The reason being that it's rare to have such naturalistic actors playing such believable characters while they are trapped in the most extraordinary of circumstances. This is where Mann excels as a filmmaker, telling stories that are somewhat far-fetched and yet it doesn't matter because as an audience we have a sincere emotional investment in the characters. As we watch Max and Vincent confide in each other, and as we see them both become torn by internal conflict, we can't help but empathize with their plights and wonder, ""What would I do in that situation?""

After seeing Collateral, I surprisingly really didn't have a problem with the issue of why a hit-man would have a cabbie drive him around from hit to hit.

A professional killer has been hired to eliminate all the witnesses and even the cops and other prosecution personnel in some criminal case. Banal. He does not want to drive his own car and he does not want to hire a car and an accomplice to drive him around. So he comes at night and just hires a taxi and its driver. That makes him difficult to trace. But that creates some problems because the taxi-driver is not really willing to do the job. And then the two are like mutual prisoners or custodians. One cannot work without the other and one cannot escape from the other. Yet the taxi-driver, after a long series of killings, finds the courage to cause an accident which means the arrival of the cops, but that also means the discovery of the first body that had been put in the trunk and the taxi driver's discovery that the next and last target is the woman he had transported just before this embarrassing and invading client. He decides to escape from the cop who is trying to arrest him, and who was alone on his car patrol, and to prevent the killing of the girl. He will even go slightly further. But that's not the main interest of the film. We could have predicted all that from the very start. Then it's only details. The interest is the rhythm and the twists in the fabric of the tale. In fact it is economical in blood and even bullets because it centers on the psychological profile of the taxi-driver and the relation he establishes with his customer. Strangely enough it is more psychological than we could have expected and that saves the film from banality.

First the movie: Collateral is a great film with plenty of action & suspense. What makes this movie is the fact that it takes place completely at night - not that this is so unusual but it's in an urban environment (LA) and Michael Mann (Director) managed to film this in a way that has not been done before. The way LA looks at night - there's just something about it and it's right here. Some reviews complain about things like ""the cab drives around with a heavily dented roof and never gets caught"" - but honestly, how many people would notice that on a cab at night?

1528849,4,B00005JN2Z,"Tom Cruise got a lot of favorable press at the time of this film's release for playing an unredeemed and unredeemable killer.  He is good, to be sure.  You won't quickly forget his steely, relentless hitman.  He's like demon from an icy hell.  Still, while not exactly a one-note performance, he takes a back seat to Jamie Foxx (literally AND figuratively) in this taut thriller.  Foxx, of course, has the advantage of portraying a Mensch, not a psychopath.  You feel for him every moment he is in the clutches of Cruise's madman.  And just when you think he might get out, he always gets sucked back in.  It is as nightmarish a scenario as any horror film.

Even the predictable elements (like the fact that Jada Pinckett Smith's character will somehow wind up getting embroiled in the mayhem) are fraught with twists and turns.  Her involvement ups the ante for Foxx's taxi driver hero Max.  He has already proven himself more resourceful and resilient than viewers might have guessed at first.  By the end of the film, Max proves himself more than the killer's equal, matching him manoeuvre for manoeuvre.

At the film's beginning, Max is revealed as a cab driver who knows Los Angeles like the proverbial back of his hand.  He can tell you exactly how long it will take to get from one point to another in that sprawling city.  Affable and modest about his talents, he nonetheless conveys quite early on that, in the contest of wills with this murderous outsider, he will prove to have home turf advantage.

And what a home turf it is.  As many have stated, LA by night is as much a character in the film as the two principles.  It's seamy glamour has seldom been better portrayed.  Contemporary Los Angeles takes on an almost surreal, foreboding aura.  It's like BLADE RUNNER, without the sci-fi elements.  That creepy.  And that good.",1220054400,,1840,4.684375

Ahhh...Vincent shoots people and then, shoots more people. I really loved the way he put down the scumbag punks in the alley. HK USP, Glock, HK MP4, Beretta, Sig-Sauer, Uzi?

1528851,5,B00005JN2Z,"This movie is about a man of action who meets a man of thinking and what happens when the two meet and interact with each other and thus learn from and change each other.  It is my belief that the movie shows the psychological make-up of each person and how this produces collateral effects - in the structure and make-up of their own lives, as well as in each character's interactions with others.

The character played by Jamie Foxx is all thought and no action.  This is impacting his life, the life of the people he comes into contact with on the streets of LA, and his relationship with his family (grandmother).  He analyzes everything and never acts.  He is paralyzed by his analysis (like the saying analysis paralysis). He doesn't take action.

The character played by Tom Cruise is all action and no thinking.  He hasn't thought about the impact his job is having on other people.  He doesn't care.  He just executes his assigned missions.  He doesn't even assign his own missions, or stated differently, he doesn't even direct his own life - he just takes orders.  He is like a robot.  He is like a machine and not a thinking human. He just acts.  He hasn't really even thought about what he is doing with his life.  He doesn't care. He doesn't think.

When the two meet, they collide. They change each other.  This change in each other changes other people as well.  The meeting and interaction of Tom Cruise's character with Jamie Foxx's character produces ""collateral effects"" and hence the title of the movie.

In the end, they each become both men of action and men of thought.  For one character, he moves on with his life with his new psychological make-up (a mix of both thought and action), but for the other character, his new mix of thought and action and his new realization of his life is too late.

This movie is an excellent psychological thriller.  The cinematography is unique and powerful.  The direction and the writing - excellent as well.
I also love the soundtrack.

This is another brilliant and excellent work by Michael Mann.",1214092800,,2061,4.632596685082873

1528884,5,B00005JN2Z,"I love this movie. It's gritty, dark, and intense as only Michael Mann knows how to make his movies. I love Mann's style of making crime dramas. If you enjoyed Heat, and Miami Vice, then you'll appreciate Mann's work here. He uses that similar dark style of filming that pretty much takes place throughout the course of an evening, so that way he can capture different light angles and images that come out from everyday street life. He really enjoys making a film that takes place at night and in the big city so he can fully encompass that city life type of atmosphere. It's a crime drama, it's in a big city, it's a professional scenario. Aside from Mann's brilliance in directing, I will boldy go out on a limb and say that this is Tom Cruise's best acting role to date. He's usually an over-the-top actor that is rarely believable, but I thoroughly enjoyed his role as a stoic hitman who doesn't show emotion, but is just as witty as the next guy.  Jamie Foxx plays your typical dopey cab driver who is always aspiring to leave the cab, but knows he lacks that one spark to make him do it.  Well that fire is ignited once he lets Tom Cruise's character into his cab for what he thinks will be just a regular cab ride. If you're a fan of the movies Heat and Miami Vice then you'll like Collateral for its simple storyline but amazing cinematography and dialogue pretty much between two characters in Vincent and Max.

Keep Michael Mann on your radar if you haven't already.  I hope he comes out with dozens of more films like this.",1205884800,2,1535,4.413427561837456
1528885,5,B00005JN2Z,"Lately, Tom Cruise has been getting on everyone's nerves, and it is easy to see why. He's been a little kooky for the past few years and it has been very annoying...however, I have to say that none of that has tarnished the fact that he is a fantastic actor, and this film is proof of that statement...well, this and ""Magnolia"" of course.

I recently revisited ""Collateral"" over the weekend, and I have to say that Tom Cruise delivers what I think is an Oscar-worthy performance as a contract killer named Vincent, who gives a New York taxi driver - a superb Jamie Foxx - the ride of his life. You all know the plot by now, so there is no point getting into it here. All that you need to know is that the film boasts some excellent scenery, dialogue, and a pretty cool film score. Michael Mann is at the top of his game here. He manages to inject that ""Miami Vice"" feel into all of his work, and it just comes off as incredilbly awesome.

The thing that I love about this film is that it doesn't succomb to the conventional ""lets blow crap up"" attitude of it's genre. It's an intelligent thriller with a considerable amount of character development, and of course, there are times where suspension of disbelief is required, but not to the point where you are rolling your eyes. I usually avoid action films like the plague, but this is the exception as it does more than offer you boom booms and bang bangs.

At  the end, the dialogue was so childish that it's unbearable! Cruise said to Jamie ""I was just trying to make a living!"" before trying to kill Jamie. But it turned out Cruise was killed by Jamie! On top of that, there's no suspense at all.

No wonder it's a big flop at the box office. This is one of the worst movies starring Tom Cruise. Save your money on this one.",1203120000,7,564,4.403846153846154

He gives these characters depth, complexity, and crackling dialogue as he takes us deep into their world and their way of thinking and behaving.
Tom Cruise is so good in the role of the criminal Vincent that after a few minutes, you will forget who it is you're watching.  Jamie Foxx is also expertly cast as the unlucky cab driver, Max, who is forced to go along on a dangerous, all-night ride through the streets of L.A. as Vincent forces him to drive him from one ""hit"" to another.
Jada Pinkett Smith also performs well as an earlier fare who ends up embroiled in the mess and nearly loses her life.

1528888,4,B00005JN2Z,"The amazing aspect of this story is that the dialogue centers upon two characters Vincent and Max inside a taxi cab. What begins as a simple car fare for the taxi driver turns into a high-tension dialogue as the cabbie witnesses a murder committed by his passenger. Max played by Jamie Foxx is then coerced into participating in the murders. Collateral as a story works because of the ensuing dialogue, which takes place after this point.

The cab in this story is a far cry from the couch in a psychologist's office, but some of the dynamics are present. At this point the character of Vincent knows that he can disclose his thoughts and takes on life in complete confidentiality and safety as a client in receiving psychological therapy; as he is assured that the conversation will go no further than the cab as he can kill Max when he has outlived his usefulness, Vincent discloses his nihilistic philosophy without reservation, which belittles the value of human life, and also shows his rationalization for his own existence and his profession. Questions are posed to Vincent by Max, who is subjugated to not only to listen to this bizarre worldview, but witnesses it being carried out as Vincent fulfills his contractual obligations. Max's questions are answered in a cold, logical fashion, which are hard for Max to refute upon first hearing them. Vincent's answers are so well-thought out that one has to wonder if Vincent's has already presented such reasons in conversations with others in the past or that he had to convince himself first that this is how his world works.

A shift in this story takes place in Max's personality as he is coerced into certain potentially dangerous situations. Max is forced to adopt Vincent's mindset if he is to survive these situations and it is eye-opening to see that character change in the cab driver. Throughout the faade of their relationship Vincent is complete control of Max, until Max applies such nihilism directly upon Vincent.

Michael Mann does an excellent job with this character-driven movie. His commentary provides further insight into the character's background, but also focuses on Tom Cruise's training and development of Vincent's character. Jamie Foxx performs amazingly as Max. Smaller but no less potent was Mark Ruffalo's impressive character of Detective Fanning.  Very cool, dedicated and sharp, my wish is that Fanning's character would have played more of a dominant role in the story. However, Michael Mann uses Fanning as the catalyst for Max's own catharsis. Altogether the movie is filled with interesting characters, insights, and entertainment.",1198972800,3,2627,5.074074074074074

After HEAT (which frames a classic confrontation between DeNiro and Pacino in a movie that was a symphony of violence and introspection), Mann takes two more exceptional actors in Cruise and Foxx, and sets them against each other in the confines of a taxicab. The driver Max (Foxx), a loser who dreams of paradise, is the hostage of existentialist contract killer Vincent (Cruise), who first tricks and then forces Max into chauffering him around LA as he executes his bloody tasks.  Full of Mann's prototypical and wry observations, and beautifully photographed, edited and scored, the movie grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go. Probably Tom Cruise's finest performance ever, as he reaches inside to extract a psychotic darkness and animal intelligence that redefines him as an actor.",1192406400,,915,5.1824324324324325
1528941,5,B00005JN2Z,"Within an actor's career there is generally one film, sometimes more, that is viewed as a defining moment for that actor. The point at which no matter what is going on in the person's public life, according to the media, or however many successful movies or flops they've had throughout their career, a moviegoer sees this defining moment and says ""This person is actually a really solid actor, and completely sold me on their character, to the point I actually forgot who the actor was I was watching."" Or at least say or think something to that effect after watching the defining movie. Anyways, it doesn't really matter how long a person's career is, this moment can happen early or late in a career, it's all a matter of the right material at the right time. For Tom Cruise, his defining moment, actually moments in his case, would be ""The Last Samurai"" and ""Collateral""; the latter is the one I believe was his biggest moment. Both movies came later in his career, long after he had become a household name.

""Collateral"" takes place in Los Angeles over the course of one long night for a cab driver named Max (Jamie Foxx), whose newest fare, an outgoing man named Vincent (Tom Cruise), is about to turn his life upside down. Unbeknownst to Max when he took this newest fare, Vincent is a contract killer who is in town to make five stops, which amounts to five kills, and then leaves L.A. as if he was never there. Now, Max must struggle with the fact that he is essentially becoming an accomplice to the murder of 5 people, while at the same time he is trying to find a way to not only survive the night, but also save a few of the people's lives in the process.

For me, ""Collateral"" is the biggest defining moment in Tom Cruise's career, I know I said he's had two moments, but this movie is much more significant than ""The Last Samurai"", in terms of how convincing his performance truly was. In this movie Tom Cruise still plays a likeable character, to an extent, but one with a much darker side than most of his characters, and over the course of the movie Vincent loses all of his charm, becoming even colder, to the point that there is no possible redemption for him in the audiences eyes. To my knowledge, this is the first time that Cruise has ever played an all-out villain, sure he's played a few characters with questionable morals and what-not, but never one that is purely cold, calculating and in the end, evil. Another surprise for me, was the fact that Tom Cruise actually allowed his hair to be dyed gray, further evidence that he really wanted to sell this character to the audience and make them forget who it was they were watching, and know only the character on the screen. Everything about Cruise's performance was brilliant, from his charm that masked his underlying evil, to his extreme intensity and sharp focus, he never once missed a beat, and that is what allowed ""Collateral"" to become such a defining moment in his long career.

The supporting cast, primarily Jamie Foxx, was very solid, engaging and thoroughly believable. Jamie Foxx delivered an excellent performance as a cabbie who is deluding himself and those around him into believing that he will one day own a limo service for the rich and powerful. The change Max endures over the course of this one difficult night with Vincent is so deep that you see everything about him change before your eyes. From his attention to detail and cleanliness to his delusions of grandeur, nothing about Max would ever be the same after this night was over, and Jamie Foxx handled the evolution of his character with such ease and believability, that it's easy to see why he's become such a big star in Hollywood.

Directed by acclaimed director Michael Mann (""Heat""), whose great attention to detail and character development is appropriately suited to just this type of material, the fate of ""Collateral"" could not have been in any better hands. Mann has managed to direct such big name stars as Al Pacino, Robert DeNiro, and Colin Farrell throughout his career, and he's become so powerful within the Hollywood system, that he actually had the clout to be able to reject Tom Cruise, at first, in regards to the role of Vincent. It wasn't until Tom participated in a test, where he acted as if he was a deliveryman, a test that Mann used as a gauge for whether or not Tom Cruise could be believable in the role, that he won the role and the opportunity to prove just how talented he really was.

""Collateral"" is the kind of movie that demands your attention from start to finish, as it continuously builds up an intriguing story and increases the tension as the minutes tick by, leaving audiences on the edge of their seats until the credits roll.

""Collateral"" is rated R for violence and language.",1191024000,3,4784,4.615746180963573

I still should have known better than to wait three years to check out Collateral after the glowing reviews and Jamie Foxx's Supporting Actor Oscar nomination.

Tom Cruise shows that he really does have the acting chops to pull off a variety of roles as his portrayal of Vincent is quite a departure from the typical Cruise hero. He's got a different voice, walk, and attitude. And with the white hair and beard he's captivating to watch as he unstoppably takes on the sociopathic hired [...] role.

Jamie Foxx is equally engaging as Max, a big-dreaming cab driver that has never has the follow through to make any of his dreams happen. Collateral follows a night in Max's cab and the character arc that Max follows because of the events that transpire.

Jada Pinkett Smith has a smaller role, but still puts in some solid acting as a prosecuting attorney who rides in Max's cab.

The action and dialogue throughout Collateral are brilliantly played out and hard to turn away from. You won't want to miss a minute of the movie for fear of missing a cool special effect, a great acing moment, or just a quick plot point. The helicopter panning shots over the city of LA are pretty awesome too.

I agree with a remark that I read somewhere that the city of Los Angeles plays the third leading role in this movie. Director Michael Mann creates a fascinating athmosphere. The photography is breathtaking. I was unable to focus on the action and found myself wandering away and simply gawking at the images of nighttime L.A. a couple of times. The brutal and for some characters fatal events seem small and unimportant and isolated when played out against the backdrop of this huge antheap of a city. This is surely a movie that you'll want to see more often than once. The violence is very brutal and explicit, but mercifully short and well spread out over the story. It is also very realistic and functional violence, not the bizarre and completely over-the-top superhero stuff that you see in too many movies nowadays, where the opponents constantly smash, stab and shoot each other into a bloody pulp and still manage to keep on fighting.

As far as the filming of the moive. They choose to film the movie in HD rather then Film. A reasoning (rumor) was Mr. Mann thought that HD could pick up better images in the dark then film could. It's either the compression on the disc or it's the HD camera they used but I thought the film looked very grainy and dull. This might have also been a stylistic choice.

There were also many errors in the making of the film such as seeing the camera man in the reflections and stuff like that, but that doesn't really take away from the fact that it is a entertaining movie.

Jamie Foxx does a great job as a bewildered and frightened cab driver who knows he will be held accountable (at some point) for the actions of his client.  The interplay between the two actors is great, and the performances are more than convincing.

The plot is pretty original, though it is moderately predictable.  The writing is above average, and the movie is funny at times--if you like morbid humor anyway.  It should be remembered that the movie isn't supposed to be a funny movie.

It is beautiful that luck can play such a big role in one's life. If Max hadn't noticed the knock on the window and hadn't called vincent back, his life would not have changed so dramatically. ""Fate"", therefore is the first theme of this movie.

What is often misunderstood is that Tom Cruise's role in this movie is not entirely villan. He is also a victim of our urban society plagued by apathy, where people are so lonely even though surrounded by so many people. ""17 millon people, but nobody knows each other ... gets on the MTA, dies, nobody notices"" as Vincent told Max in the beginning. His emotion is epitomized by the scene where the lone Koyote crosses the street. Needless to say, Vincent finds how little different he is from this Koyote. At this moment, a beautiful music starts playing which makes this scene another memorable moment in this movie. ""Loneliness"", therefore is the second theme of this movie.

If you are like me and many other people who are more or less played by fate and are aware how much of your life is out of your control, and live or have lived in a big city like LA and experienced loneliness, then you will be able to appreciate the most beautiful part of this masterpiece.

If you are not, you can still enjoy this movie by thinking along with Max (instead of Vincent) how he can escape this curious situation he has fallen into. Vincent's plan to carry out hit using a Taxi is clever because he doesn't have to rent a car (to do so he must give his ID; also he may not be as familiar with LA's complicated streets as a cab driver does; even if the rental car comes with a GPS navigation system, without an expert like Max who even knows the schedule of traffic lights, he may still be caught in a traffic jam and not being able to carry out 5 hits in one night.) He can also let the dead cab driver take the blame of his murder, as he did previously. The flipside is of course that he must control the cab driver, which he obviously enjoys because he likes the challenge and is also interesting for the audience to watch.",1165190400,3,2330,4.3764434180138565
1529046,5,B00005JN2Z,"We should start stopping to create films with such a deep meaning
and such an outrageous end.
This kind of moral where you can see a genius killer, the
character of Tom Cruise in this film, being killed by a mediocre taxi
driver only because the producers think that the good wins the bad is
always the bad choice. The killer in this case, tried to explain to
the stupid Jamie Foxx's character, his reasons to kill that kind of useless people
but with that dunce taxi driver it was just lost of time.
During all the film you can watch Tom developing his role with talent
a sensitive killer just killing peolple that deserves to, and a taxi
driver that appears as a stupid enemy, and even with absolute none ability
with guns, he got to shot the professional killer, that was really
a kind of impossible thing to happen in a real life indeed.
So all the meanings that The character tried to pass through the
film was destroyed by the medioCre choice of the director and
the producers. When I was in the movie theater, watching this movie for the first time, I thought to myself
""Maybe this happened because of the afirmative actions, the black actor
coudn't be killed by the white actor , they were afraid of being considered as racists"", well, who knows?
The problem here is: Who was the good MAN? In my opinion the killer, and
why? Just because he was killing useless men, not good characters or
workers innocent men. You can say that is not right kill people, even
bad people, but I have to say, you wrong!
One philosopher said that the evil develops when the good men
permits. In this case the good man is the killer and the bad one the
mediocre taxi driver, a traitor that killed without reason and that
is the worst thing to do.

Tom Cruise gets his chance to play a bad guy, and he puts in one of his better performances.  He plays a hitman who needs a ride.  As I suppose most hitmen would be, he's tempermental and invokes his own brand of ethics in order to justify his actions.

Jamie Foxx portrays a run-of-the-mill Joe Nobody cab driver who gets caught picking up the ""wrong"" passenger.  Kind of wrong place / wrong time - squared.  As viewers, we end up putting ourselves in his place, and the result is quite a psychological thriller.

I've always enjoyed Michael Mann movies & would not mind his making more films.  His works always bring an ""intensity"" to the table not normally found too often in most other films.

1529091,1,B00005JN2Z,"We all knew form the previews of this movie that Tom Cruse is a hit man and Jamie Foxx is a cab driver. And, that Tom commandeers Jamie and his cab for a night of killing. The problem, for me was when the mild-mannered, soft-spoken cab driver turns into a macho operative and then a super hero.

Max (Jamie Foxx) has been a cab driver for twelve years. Although he has dreams and aspirations; that's about all they are. After twelve years he is still a cab drive. Yet, when he picks up a sophisticated lady lawyer, he charms her with his quick wit and knowledge; to the point that she gives him her phone without him even asking for it. I did not buy that for a minute.

His next fare is Vincent (Tom Cruse). Vincent wants to hire Max's cab for the night and is willing to pay well beyond Max's usual night-time take. Yet Max resist. (Why? I don't understand this.) Reluctantly Max agrees to Vincent's request but only after Vincent really pushes the issue. Then, everything changes when Max -- by accident -- finds out that Vincent is a killer. And, that Vincent plans on killing more people with Max as his wheel man.

Remember, Max is a mild-mannered, passive type of person. So he not only fears for his life but he is scared out of his wits. And so, he allows Vincent to intimidate him into going along on the killing spree.

Of course all does not go as planned.

Without giving away the plot (if you can call it that) Max is forced by Vincent to confront some very bad people -- on his own. Yet, while being scared out of his wits and surrounded by gun wheeling henchmen; Max is able to bluff the very bad man by putting on a macho act. I did not buy that for a second.

After more killings, Max is still scared but decides that Vincent must be stopped. So, without regard for his own life (anymore), Max makes an all out effort to stop Vincent. That, of course, does not work. Vincent leaves Max in a precarious situation and continues to go after his next victim. So Max, in his now obsession to stop Vincent, overpowers a police officer who is arresting him, takes the police officer's gun, and goes after Vincent to stop him.

1529094,4,B00005JN2Z,"""Collateral"" is a fashionable example of just how exuberant a thriller can be. A film such as this is an endurance test for the director, since it is composed of gritty, dark material that makes the film itself more challenging to tame. The film's sturdy foundation is constructed primarily of the performances of Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx, who, when they are both at the top of their games, seem to dominate the other major and minor characters that arrive on screen. I am sure that the movie would have been as enticing if it were just the two of them in the story and no one else.

As the first frames elapse we realize that we could very well be watching two totally different movies. It is mid-afternoon in Los Angeles, and a mellowed-out cab driver named Max (Jamie Foxx) is shuttling his fares around the city. One of which is Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith), a beautiful attorney who is trying to get back to her firm and do some last minute prep work for a big case that she has the following day. Annie suggests a route to her firm, but Max offers a quicker one. He tells her that if his way is, in fact, slower, she will not have to pay the fare.

This opens up for a long conversation in which two people at different spots on the social ladder engage in some intriguing, flirting-free dialogue. Screenwriter Stuart Beattie uses this scene to set up two important characters who inevitably play crucial roles in the story, and not a single word exchanged between the two gives the film a negative effect. Max ends up winning his bet with Annie, but he insists that the ride be free of charge. When Annie walks away, we can tell by the look on Max's face that he wanted desperately to get her number. Then Annie unexpectedly returns to the cab, taps on the window, and hands him her card.

As she walks away, Max sighs in relief as he realizes his night is made. But as he pulls away from the curb, another fare slips into his cab. The man's name is Vincent (Tom Cruise). He needs a driver to stay with him during the night and take him to five separate locations around Los Angeles, and he offers Max a handful of one hundred dollar bills to do the job. Vincent is a polite, charming, and conversational individual. He has a big night ahead of him - and so does Max.

What unfolds for the remaining 100 minutes is a long conversation between hit man and mild-mannered cab driver. ""Collateral"" is all about dialogue and set pieces, with a story managing to fit perfectly into a script. The two leads exchange late night chit-chat, personal beliefs, and, when a body falls from a window thanks to the violent will of Vincent, some more aggressive words. Max finds himself fending for his life, as Vincent abruptly morphs into a malevolent customer.

The mere fact that Vincent is a killer does not make him the bad guy in the film. True he is bad, but ""Collateral"" somehow does not establish the ""hero and villain formula."" In fact, it is not even focused on establishing it. The conflict is that of a struggle between two men with two totally different agendas, and the battleground is composed of psychological and verbal warfare. We watch and hope that the struggle will escalate into a physical battle as we realize that this is a situation that Max can not escape just by using words and mind games. He will have to get out of it by using his head and, if needs be, his more aggressive side. The question is, will he? That is a question that you must find the answer to. ""Collateral"" is such an intelligent film that seems so complex, but is instead so simple.

There is one scene where Vincent and Max go into a jazz nightclub and talk with the owner, who has a long history of performing in music. It is incredible how situations so simple can grasp your attention just by the words that are exchanged by the characters involved. Most movies are stories jammed with dialogue, but ""Collateral"" is dialogue jammed with a story.

Not to say that the film is flawless. As the movie lags on, the body count rises, and if you have seen last years ""A Man Apart"", you probably know how careless this can get.  ""Collateral"" s final twenty minutes should be its most enticing, and while they are, they are also the sloppiest. I would have loved to have seen the film end in something besides a chase that rampages through a massive building and concludes on a subway, but Michael Mann's direction and Stuart Beattie's screenplay thoughtfully turn it into an intriguing cat-and-mouse game. You can't help but lean forward in your seat during the prolonged climax, but when all is said and done, you will most likely hope for some sort of alternate ending on the film`s DVD extras.

If nothing else, ""Collateral"" is purely electrifying when it wants to be, and even when it isn't it is still an enjoyable watch. What we have here is a thriller that focuses on its two main characters, gives them a certain period of time to battle it out, and entertains the audience in the process. While there is not enough potential for an Oscar as far as best film goes, this is still a great movie, but screenwriter Stuart Beattie should be given an award for his trouble.

Rated R; 120 minutes; Directed by Michael Mann",1138060800,6,5208,4.489968321013728
1529095,4,B00005JN2Z,"This is one of the few examples of the DVD extras of a movie being neither completely superfluous & annoying nor destroying the enjoyability of the movie it is supposedly enhancing. While the movie easily stands on its own terms without any ""Collateral 101"" preparation, bearing a witness to the genius of ""Michael Mann University"" as Jamie Foxx beautifully put it, made for a quantum leap in my appreciation of this film.

About ten years ago, when HEAT came to the theatres, my first reaction was that any director who could entice Al Pacino and Robert de Niro to not just be in the same movie but play antagonists to each other had to be, as Russell Crowe continually refers to him, ""a force of nature""; above and beyond the brilliance of directing/producing an 80's TV detective show that changed how everyone in New York dressed (let alone Miami), even in the wintertime. Not only was my intuition on point, since seeing it in the theatres I have seen HEAT at least 25 times--without exaggeration--and am continuously amazed at how impossible it is to get sick of it.

COLLATERAL is just like it. A cab driver, in denial over the lack of ownership he's taken over his own life and dreams, has two passengers in one night: a beautiful young state prosecutor who begins to like him as much as he likes her (Jada Pinkett Smith)...and a somewhat arrogant businessman type (Tom Cruise) whose real estate ventures and overnight visits to friends turns out to be the murderous agenda of a sociopath assassin for hire. How all three of these lives rise and converge on the streets of Los Angeles is done with such impeccable artistry and refinement that every scene takes on a level of believability; every scene shows another step in the transformation--or deconstruction--of every character.

Foxx is brilliant. His character's journey is so measured and so real that you cannot help but undergo it with him at key points. Tom Cruise, who is as underrated as often as he is overrated as an actor (while his work in THE LAST SAMAURAI disappointed me, I still have not forgiven the Academy for dissing him in MAGNOLIA), gives what can easily be called his Denzel/TRAINING DAY/""finally, someone gives me a bad guy"" career performance. The nihilism of his character, constantly proclaimed as he feels himself succumbing to the crisis of conscience making his sanity ever more fragile, is overshadowed by his ruthlessness...and yet not.

I would have gone with the title VINCENT & MAX, playing on the expectations of it being a buddy movie.  It is one (strangely), and yet paradoxically is also anything but. But that just once again reveals the genius of the real star of this picture: director Michael Mann. So many innocent people are either killed or have their lives changed forever by the events of this one night that Los Angeles does become a covert war zone. And before the movie ends, it becomes obvious that the only way all three characters in the most fascinatingly disturbing ""love"" triangle I have seen in quite some time can survive, is if they treat the innocent and not so innocent bystanders who drop like flies as what the title of the movie implies.  Mann, like a vampire watching his freshly bit victim becoming a vampire itself, turns Los Angeles into a mini Baghdad after sunset and before sunrise; making the characters--and us, the witnesses--both victims and accomplices of it all.

Again, instead of being distracted by the DVD additions that open you to the world and aesthetic of Michael Mann, you will probably find yourself gaining an even greater appreciation for his work in general and this movie in particular.

I give it four stars and not five because of the way it ended. The final scenes momentarily reminded me that I was watching a well-crafted movie and not helplessly experiencing a live event.  Mann and the screenwriter gave in to the temptation of controlling the drama of the story through craftsmanship, and not setting it free to uncontrollably disturb and write its own ending, via being as unpredictable and unstructured as life really is. In other words, in the last five minutes, just as he was about to complete a giant, in-your-face Jackson Pollock, it seemed like he got scared for some reason and made a Tiffany lamp.  That is where HEAT, for me, outshines this work. But the movie is sweet nonetheless. You will not be disappointed.",1137888000,,4385,4.811420982735724
1529096,4,B00005JN2Z,"And some fine acting by Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise.

This stylish, atmospheric thriller is yet another Hollywood ode to the hit man.  I mean, what is with this sub-genre?  Consider these engaging hit man movies from the 90s:

2 Days in the Valley (1996)  Danny Aiello as an over the hill hit man turned pizza baker.

Grosse Pointe Blank (1997)  John Cusack as a cute whimsical amoral murder artist with Dan Aykroyd giving some comedic support in an over-the-top portrayal of a rival hit man always making with the jokes.

The Professional (1994) Jean Reno stars as Leon, a cold-blooded professional hit man sans people skills who doesn't know how to read (but has a heart).

La Femme Nikita (1990) Anne Parillaud plays a bitter, drug-dependent, unsocialized child of the streets who becomes a highly skilled hit woman.

Point of No Return (1993) starring Bridget Fonda, is a kind of Americanized La Femme Nikita.

And there are more I'm sure that I've missed.

I think this sub-genre came about when film makers got desperate to do something besides ""on the lam"" movies and mafia glorifications.  I also think this sub-genre has something in common with ""the whore with the heart of gold"" flick.  It would appear that these days an actress doesn't really feel fulfilled and accomplished unless she has played a prostitute.  Can it be that actors in general will feel unfulfilled until they have played a hit man/woman?

Surprisingly enough Collateral is also a buddy movie of sorts, or at least Tom Cruise's Vincent thinks he is making a friend, in as much as he is capable of making a friend.  Jamie Foxx doesn't think so since he clearly divines that Vincent is one very sick psychopath.

But what makes this movie stand out, aside from Foxx and Cruise doing such a great job, is how stylish is the development, how worldly wise the dialogue, and how crisp the direction.  The fact that Jamie Foxx could have and should have gotten away from Cruise half a dozen times is really the only flaw in the movie.

Another good film directed by Michael Mann is The Insider (1999) starring Al Pacino and Russell Crowe.",1137024000,2,2110,4.713114754098361

1529098,1,B00005JN2Z,"Collateral may well be the single most ridiculous and utterly absurd screenplay ever put into production by a major studio in this century. While the inexplicable critical praise for the film might be expected to result in some failure to live up to expectations, this fails on even the most basic levels of construction for the very dumbest of action movies - and this certainly is the dumbest piece of hokum I've seen in the past ten years. I'm simply at a loss as to how anyone could think this thrill-free thriller even a competent piece of drama, let alone a masterpiece.

One of the problems with people who make more than one good movie is that we very unreasonably expect them to keep on making good movies instead of just being grateful for what they've given us in the past. So I'll go on being
grateful to Mann for Manhunter, Heat, The Insider, The Jericho Mile and Last of the Mohicans (even if he is determined to re-edit the heart out of them if left unchecked) and mark this one down as a paycheck. It's just a shame that, unlike Terrence Malick, nobody set up a trust fund for him so that he wouldn't have to make movies this bad just to pay the bills.

The film starts off with a disadvantage - the high concept setup is a hard premise to sell, and the film singularly fails to do so. But instead of going off in the `we know this is stupid, but let's have fun with it' route, instead it tries to play it as serious psychodrama and character piece while offering some of the most ridiculous plotting imaginable.

Cruise is supposedly a top of his game hitman, but is the most spectacularly inept killer the screen has ever seen, revealing himself to dozens of witnesses, beating up and shooting people in crowded nightclubs (the film's utter lowpoint) and even accompanying his reluctant chauffeur on a visit to his mother in hospital. Short of taking over a Presidential press conference at gunpoint, it's hard to imagine him drawing more attention to himself in almost every single scene. By the final reel when he turns into an indestructible relentless Tominator stalking the pair, you suddenly start to appreciate the finely crafted plots and elegant dialogue found in the works of Dolph Lundgren, Jean-Claude Van Damme and Olivier Gruner, none of whom have ever descended to such preposterous lows. It's notable that Jason Statham kept his name off the credits in this one, and he had no such qualms over Revolver.

By the time the unbelievable coincidence of the passenger Foxx falls for being - shock, horror - the last name on the list is wheeled on, we've sat through so many much more unbelievable coincidences and idiotic lapses in logic and credibility that it almost seems rational. Suspension of disbelief is one thing, but this is just taking the piss.

Not that faulty suspension is the only thing wrong with this vehicle. None of the individual scenes ever convince or work on their own terms, with every development or line of dialog not just horribly telegraphed but practically written in the sky. Characterization is equally facile and predictable, with only vague moments hinting at possibilities glossed over en route to the next botched setpiece. The performances are variable: Cruise, Foxx, Javier Bardem and, most surprisingly, Jada Pinkett Smith are fine but not outstanding, but Mark Ruffalo becomes increasingly laughable as it becomes ever clearer that the depth of his characterization extends to doing a not very good John Travolta/Chilli Palmer impersonation.

I take no pleasure in writing off this utter trainwreck of a movie. There could have been a good little straight-to-video movie in this, but the end result is a completely unacceptable piece of junk that goes straight into my All-time Ten Worst list. Garbage.",1136505600,3,3771,4.811728395061729
1529099,4,B00005JN2Z,"A very cool film by Michael Mann. Collateral has action,suspense and very good performances. All in a beautiful location of L.A. that makes this film very cool.

The film starts with a cool cameo by Jason Statham giving Vincent (Tom Cruise) his discs of information for do his job in L.A.Then we see Max (Jamie Foxx) and how the daily life of a cabbie goes. He meets on one of his rides a beautiful attorney Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith) and gets lucky with getting her phone number. As luck hit him well with Annie. Luck went the other way and brought Vincent to his cab. He has to be hostage to Vincent while he makes his rounds on killings his contacts in one night in L.A..Max has to find his way out of this situation and in the process learn a big lesson life.

Tom Cruise gives a great performance as the bad guy that's a sociopath in the film. This is the first part Tom Cruise has ever gotten that is the villain. But this guy isn't your bad guy you want to hate. Vincent is a cool guy that we kind of like. He likes Jazz,he's smart,he's nice. The character has a backrground. You can see it in the film with Tom Cruise performance. Example when he and Max visit Max's mother were he buys the flowers for her. But the other reason is Michael Mann way of handling his characters. In each of his films you will see the characters fledge out. I mean we can understand their emotions,their actions and intentions. Even the bad guys. Like here with Vincent or in Manhunter with the killer when he is approached by a lady or in Heat with Robert De Niro character. Each character is special and interesting in Michael Mann films. He cares about them and doesn't let story move on without them. There as important as the plot. We cant forget Jamie Foxx performance that got him a Oscar and Golden Globe nomination. Always a comedian Foxx as with other actors. Many directors are afraid to use them. If people will take it the wrong way or not. He got his chance in Oliver Stone's Any Given Sunday where from them to now. Then comedian. Now award winning actor on to better and bigger things. Intresting the film was originally going to have in the role of Max Adam Sandler. I don't how the film would work with him. Even though he has proved good in drama parts lately with Punch Drunk Love and Spanglish.

Michael Mann on this film used for the first time a high definition camera. About 85-95% was in high def. He uses high def for the unique look of L.A. at night. This a great L.A. with great locals through out L.A. from palm trees,to ghettos to Korea Town. Plus nobody knows L.A. like Michael Mann. He uses L.A. like it was another character. Everthing beautifully photographed. The film could have easily gone for nomination for cinematography.

I've heard complains about the ending and especially from a friend of mine. She says this film should have ended two minutes earlier. I mean ive seen the film five times. I look at the ending and i say big deal. I don't think if they cut a minute or second of the film that it would have mad a big difference. But the most of complains are for that the ending drags and that carries on like were suppose to feel a big emotion or something like that. Also that it's a hase scene in the end. I think it's a good ending but it also goes on taste and what you prefer.

The DVD has a nice commentary track by Michael Mann which as always and his other commentary track he is very interesting and informative. There are few gaps here and there. But besides that it's a good commentary track. The special features on the second DVD are worth watching. The behind the scenes of the film is about 40 minutes with very interesting facts and information of the film and on production and preperation. The other bonus features are good but too little. One deleted scene. One thing on Tom Cruise that's cool but short and the rehearsing footage of the actors preparing to be set when they had to shoot the film.

This a nice film with a lot emotion as well for the character that we care for. This not clear action,suspense film. Where we just go from here to there without caring for what the characters feel. This film doesn't feel numb it feels real and alive. Michael Mann is one of the best directors out there. And proves once again that he is a great director.

The final target is a US Attorney that Foxx had picked up earlier and would like to date.  So it's Jamie to the rescue.  The film starts to fall apart about half way through but when it gets to the end here, it is just a joke.

Cruise's character is atypical of a Cruise character.  He gives a very good performance until the end when not even Tom can over come the mess.

Jamie Foxx is given a serious character and for the first half of the film Foxx is amazing but about half way through he pulls out his safe standard Jamie Foxx character.  And by the end he is just bouncing off the walls and chewing all the scenery.

This should have been a study of the two characters but had to become an obligatory action no brain film.

Tom Cruise plays a contract killer out to kill 5 people in

one night and uses a cab driver (Jamie Foxx) to drive him

around.

This movie had the potential to be really good... I mean, Cruise

and Foxx in a action flick? The problem is that Cruise is abit

robotic in his behavior... Perhaps that's part of the point that

he is a cold hearted killer..

However, he simply wasn't ever fully able to make me believe that

he is realistic. His behavior is not consistant... Sometimes he

does well, but other times he makes sloppy mistakes that you

really wouldn't expect a professional to do.

Also, the movie works it's hardest to be completely realistic and

that's a blessing in some ways, but in other ways it's a ledown.

I do like realistic movies, but not to the point to where it does

hurt the action... Until the end, there simply isn't enough action.

It's a well acted movie other than Cruise... Jamie does well and

the some of the wise cracks and a few scenes were good. It's

very close to being a B movie.. And honestly, this movie was a

big sign that Cruise is losing his star power because he simply

can't hold this movie up.",1133481600,,1201,4.372727272727273
1529175,4,B00005JN2Z,"Collateral is an excellent - and sometimes brilliant - thriller from Michael Mann, the director of Heat. Tom Cruise ('Vincent') holds cab driver 'Max' (Jamie Fox) hostage as he travels around LA to finish his 'work' (as Vincent puts it).

The movie starts out rather slow, and many action and thriller fans might be yawning or wondering what all the hubbub is about. But director Mann does not waste time with the camera - the first thirty minutes are integral to the story's plot and the character development of Max, a humble cab driver who does his job well, but is quick to point out that he has bigger aspirations.

Things continue on with seemingly little relevance until, by chance, Vincent (Tom Cruise) happens to pick him as his cabbie to drive him to several destinations.

From the moment Vincent talks to Max, it's apparent that something is up with Cruise. Steely eyed and grey haired, Vincent is a man in charge of his own destiny. The regular Cruise shtick - his smirks, his sunglasses - are distorted into a fierce but empty persona, giving the character the weird emotional vacancy of a sociopath. Most of his acting is done through his eyes and the confidence of his movements, delivering a completely believable but subtle performance that some might miss. While someone like, say, Javier Bardem (also in this movie) could have been cast as Vincent, Cruise adds a sense of 'glib nihilism' (as Mann puts it) and affability that makes his character both charismatic and interesting, much more so than a merely one dimensional, evil assassin.

Contrasting Vincent's confidence and fierce determination is Max, a cab driver who seems to be content, if not happy, to continue doing the same job night in and out. Compassionate and kind hearted but shy and humble, he is Vincent's polar opposite, and creates tension between the two characters as Max tries to stop him from his ruthless quest.

This tension from these two conflicting personality types is at the heart of the film. Collateral works on the level of a thriller, but is also a character study in how people can meet seemingly inconsequentially, and can change each others destinies. Excellent writing and acting makes watching Vincent and Max compelling and fascinating as both a study of who the characters are, and the subtle changes to what they become.

Max is instantly endearing and genuine, but perhaps the greatest triumph of Mann is the ability to get a performance from Cruise that is at once ruthlessly determined, but also touches on some of Vincent's latent humanity. Max's unease and sometimes shock over Vincent's nature segues into genuine talks between both characters that reach deep into the core of their inner beings. Throughout the the film, Mann makes both characters worth caring about.

The intensity of Vincent's work - and the fumbling of Max who tries to sabotage his plans - continues to escalate in an exhilarating fashion, culminating in a brilliant club shootout that is one of the best of it's kind. Filmed from several points of view, the surrealistic vibe, sound, and colors of the scene ooze sophistication. Lacking special effects like most action films, it nevertheless manages to effortlessly upstage them. This scene alone is worth the price of admission.

Much of Collateral's excellence is dependant on camera work, as some of the most poignant scenes are wordless and expressionistic. A knowing glace from Max or Vincent instantly gets feeling and emotions across without dialogue. Colors permeate the movie with a strange dream like quality that is only known to those who have quiet moments at dusk in a big city, and the cab itself feels like an entire world, never drab or boring. Whether it's streaking lights across the side of the taxi, or a shot of palm trees over someones shoulder, Collateral feels like a movie set at night in LA.

Completing the package is a solid and diverse soundtrack. From jazz to the cool vibe of club music, the movie manages to catch much in the way of the multiculturalism in big places like LA without feeling disjointed. The closing track of the movie, 'Requiem' by Antonio Pinto, gives this haunting movie an almost Vangelis Blade Runner era feel, further pressing the film into the viewers mind.

The ending is the only real hubris of the flick, unexciting and conventional compared to the exhilaration of the rest of the film.

Smart, intense, sometimes mesmerizing and beautifully acted and filmed, Collateral is something that will stay on ones mind long after the credits roll.",1133222400,,4542,4.9164490861618795
1529176,4,B00005JN2Z,"Excellent! While the true origin of Cruise's character remains somewhat a mystery, it's balanced by the fact that we don't need much to convince us of his personality, or his goals. Meanwhile we learn plenty about Foxx's character and we sympathize with his plight, becoming truly concerned for his well being, and witness to what his character eventually becomes capable of.

Plenty of suspense keeps you on the edge of your seat and Collateral delivers hearty punches in the action department as well, with great shootouts and hand to hand dirty work. Or should I say hand to neck.

Well written, well acted and well directed. Collateral gets my vote for one of the top action movies of 2004.",1132617600,,694,4.823529411764706
1529177,5,B00005JN2Z,"This movie is so cool because Tom Cruise totally wastes so many mofo's. In the club scene Micahel Mann shows his dynamic camera work as Vincent (Tom Cruise) kills so many people with precision skill. He snaps one guys neck, then kicks a guy's leg which snaps at the knee and later takes out one of his contracts. The movie is paced really well and we see Jamie Foxx showing his acting skills as a convincing meek yet virtuous cab driver. Whenever Vincent kills someone it looks so awesome. We need more ultra violent movies like this. The movie is also very deep and dark and we see who Vincent is and why he turned out the way he did.",1130630400,,635,4.3
1529178,2,B00005JN2Z,"From a craft point of view, of course, the film is superb: Cruise and Foxx give tight performances, and Michael Mann can direct stylish action set-pieces in his sleep.  Everyone involved in this project is at the peak of their powers.  So the question becomes, Why didn't they know better?

I really loved Mann's ""Heat,"" so it breaks my heart to have to point out that this film is mostly nonsense.  Maybe it's because the story, though at least engrossing on the surface level, lacks enough internal resonance to generate anything like 'meaning' or 'importance.'  Instead, as so often in American culture, importance is supposed to be implicitly assumed because people are waving guns around.

Cruise, in his always polished and convincing manner, nevertheless spouts a lot of fake philosophical hooey about the cosmos and self-actualization, and we're supposed to listen seriously because (ready for this, folks?) he's a hit man (oooh), and he's got a gun (oh my).  Jamie Foxx's character can't live up to who he wants to be, until he finds the inner strength to (get this) fire a gun.  As in so much hip-hop music, simply waving a piece around is expected to absolve the speaker of being silly or shallow.  Maybe that's just life, but I suspect that it isn't: the power to kill may be menacing, but as Christ pointed out to Pilate, it isn't really 'power' at all.  Pity no one in this film notices.

It's a shame, because there's enough brains and talent in this movie to levitate the Pentagon.  If you want an agreeable little thriller, I suppose it's a good job, except for some disappointing lapses of story logic, and a few let-downs when you're led to believe something cool and clever is about to happen, and instead, you get more waving around of guns.  I'm not an activist on the subject, I just like a bit of artistic insight along with my grand-opera silliness; and I feel cheated when an artist excuses shallowness, or covers it over, with the glamor of violence, and nothing else.  Oh well.  They've all done enough stellar work that we can let them slide on this one.  Try a bit harder next time, guys, and I bet you make a masterpiece.",1130025600,9,2152,4.6684350132626
1529179,4,B00005JN2Z,"Well Tom Cruise as a hitman?  Well that's interesting to see him break away from the everyday action hero sanerio he's usally in.  Jamie Foxx not in a comedy?  Oh boy, now this is a risk.  Either it's good ot it's awful.

Max(Jamie Foxx) is your everyday cab driver, a honest one for the past 12 years of his services to people.  After his cab drive with Annie(Jada Pickett Smith)  Then comes a guy who's hair is the same color as his suit, Vincint(Tom Cruise).  He gives off some nice loot for a couple of stops that usally cost a lot less, but when a huge puzzle peice as to who Vincint really is lands right in front of Max's face, it's all a rollarcoaster of thrills as to what happens next.

This movie does a real good job of keeping the susspence in the movie until the end.  And the fact that Jamie and Tom have proved loyal to their roles dispite typical good guy, and comedy senerios in the past.  Also during the action seenes, they are well directed, and the live style sound effects of the fighting and the gunfights really gets your adreniline rushing during the sceenes.  The only thing I didn't like about it was the end.  A whole bunch a bullets, a whole bunch of misses, only 3 feet apart(Even if it was dark, you could get the jist of where the person was.)

Collateral definitly was a huge breakthrough for Jamie Foxx's carrer which got him a oscar nomination.  And after that he got a well deserved best actor award for his extrodinary performance as Ray Charles.  As for Tom, hey, he can finally be the bad guy once in a while which is good to know.  This movie has great suspenction in it, and it also has great action sceenes in it.  Just what to expect from the Director of Heat(Michael Mann).

WHY would a hit-man use a cab when he could easily have rented a car? Or stolen a car? Foxx's character Max asks ""why my cab"" instead of the more pressing question: ""why any cab?""

What happens when a working class stiff - you know, a decent human being and a live-and-let-live Average Joe type - finds himself face to face with Evil incarnate?  Well, that's exactly what happens to a cab driver named Max in Michael Mann's allegorical thriller ""Collateral,"" a sharply-defined morality tale that unfolds on the freeways and surface streets of after-hours Los Angeles.

""Collateral"" is that rare crime drama that is more concerned with theme and character than with the mechanics of the crime - at least until the movie shatters to pieces in its closing reel, that is.  But for starters, writer Stuart Beattie has come up with a humdinger of a premise to get the ball rolling.  Max has been driving a cab for twelve years now, but he still has dreams of owning a fancy limo company one day, then retiring to his own private little island getaway in the South Seas.  One fateful night, he picks up a fare who will end up changing his life forever.  Vincent is a paid assassin who virtually kidnaps Max, forcing him to drive him around town so he can track down and execute his assigned hits.  Max can do little but look on helplessly as he gets pulled further and further into this cat-and-mouse game of cold-blooded murder.

""Collateral"" is, above all, an actor's film, as two intriguing characters square off in a fascinating duel of wills.  As Max, Jamie Foxx beautifully captures the subtle intensity of a man, passive and humanistic by nature, who is forced to participate in what is to him an incomprehensible case of ritualized slaughter.  Tom Cruise, cast against type as an unshaven, salt-and-pepper-haired villain, is chilling as a steely-eyed killer seemingly cut off from even the most basic human emotions of empathy and concern for one's fellow man.  Together, these two fine actors draw us into their epic struggle between the forces of good and the forces of evil, with the latter seemingly holding most of the cards.

The movie is filled with moments of extraordinary suspense and tension as Vincent and Max act out their human drama against the backdrop of a beautifully filmed LA at night - with Mann showing, once again, as he did in ""Heat,"" that no director captures that milieu with greater precision than he does.  Moreover, the moody soundtrack provides a perfect, otherworldly complement to the slightly surreal story unraveling on screen.

Unfortunately, ""Collateral"" falls apart long about the last half hour, as the plot mechanics take over and the characters become pawns in the hands of an out-of-control screenwriter who obviously could find no workable way to bring his tale to a satisfying conclusion.  The tension in the first three-quarters of the film derives from our knowledge that Vincent has, for all intents and purposes, caught Max in a snare from which he cannot escape.  Thus, that cab becomes a crucial factor in the human drama taking place within its restrictive confines.  But once Max and Vincent leave the cab and become separated in the closing stretches, we lose that sense of claustrophobic entrapment so essential to the tale, and most of the tension evaporates.  Thus, what starts off as a severely circumscribed tale of two men caught in their own private little hell ultimately devolves into a damsel-in-distress, knight-in-shining-armor action fantasy that undercuts the realism and seriousness of all that came before.

Still, taken as a whole, ""Collateral"" is a thriller well worth watching.",1125705600,3,3476,4.970639032815199
1529282,1,B00005JN2Z,"This movie is ""Kitten With a Whip"" meets ""Terminator"" and ""Miami Vice"" - but without any of the excitement, fun, plot or interest you would expect from jamming those things together.

Tom Cruise's performance is at the center of this movie, and even though he may be a bizarre couch-bouncing Brooke Shields-berating spazz, he's still a great actor.  He and Jamie Foxx are the only two things saving this moving from direct-to-video land.

The pacing of this movie is atrocious.  The Exposition is clunky and ponderous, and even then barely gets out amidst all of the extraneous junk in the first 15 minutes of this movie.  By the way, after the first 15 minutes,  you know exactly what is going to happen in this predictable dog.  Rather than being suspenseful or even languid, the film dithered.  Hey, it's not every movie that takes you on a detour to a jazz club.  And this movie is polite enough to stop to let coyotes cross the street.  However, even chopping out 30 minutes of tedium wouldn't help this movie, due to the plethora of other flaws.

We see many of the most annoying movie cliches here.  Man Wrongly Accused - my wife's favorite.  Educated Successful Professional Woman Isn't Fulfilled Until Meeting Working Class Man with Heart of Gold - check.  Colombians Dealing Drugs - got that.  Captive Blows Obvious Chances to Escape - check.  Woman Needs Man to Rescue Her - yep.  We even have the Incredible Unkillable Villain, and to top it off, the Hero's Death Battle Exemption.  You can play this at home.  Blend all these together into a script over the course of a tipsy evening and you can do better than ""Collateral"" did.  The problem here is not just that the cliches are tedious in and of themselves; rather, they form the entire plot, such as it is.

Before ""Collateral,"" the movie ""Point Break"" was the poster child for cheesy pure-coincidence police ""work,"" because one lucky break led Keanu right to the bank robbers with no need for that pesky logical analysis stuff.  But ""Collateral"" really takes the cake, with 4-count-em-4 unlikely-beyond-your-wildest-dreams coincidences assisting the cops in their attempt to figure out what's going on.  Because that's what makes a good crime movie - stupid cops and random coincidence.

Michael Mann's contempt for Los Angeles drips from every frame, from the dialogue to the choice of shots and locations.  I happen to love LA (just like Randy Newman), and that was one more reason I didn't care for this movie.

And one last thing - what the heck does the word ""collateral"" have to do with this movie?

Avoid, avoid, avoid.  If you insist on seeing a Michael Mann film, rent or buy ""Manhunter"" instead, from a time before the director started making flabby, self-indulgent films like this.",1125014400,15,2759,4.812765957446809

1529337,4,B00005JN2Z,"Michael Mann has a unique directorial style that seduces the viewer into casual interest in the characters, then sucks us into the building suspense till we can't escape. Jamie Foxx's portrayal of Max, the cabbie, is first-rate as an unassuming likeable, honest guy, while Cruise's portrayal of Vincent is a more accurate depiction of his real-life persona than the average fan would easily decipher. I especially enjoyed Jada Pinkett-Smith's portrayal of a prosecutor, underplayed by the fast-moving script, but seemingly perfectly appropriate for the plot shifts. The average viewer with any ethical sensibility would easily root for Max, caught in a whirlwind of Vincent's profit-centered crimes. Without spoiling the suspense, suffice to say IMHO that this film presents Tom Cruise as his true self, the role he was born to play, particularly as such a hell-bent advocate of the Scientology cult, whose raison d'etre revolves around profit and power for its own sake, and literally to Hell with anyone who would dare attempt to stop them, including the U.S. federal government. Cruise's Vincent is a sheer mercenary, a role that L. Ron Hubbard would relish in watching one of his own disciples portraying, wishing that he, Hubbard himself, had been talented enough to be assigned such a role in a feature film, rather than remaining a mediocre con-man throughout his life, founding a capitalist cult rooted in Satanism a la Aleister Crowley, his personal mentor. If not for the risk of spoiling the film, I would specify my favorite scene, but I wish no personal harm to anyone as depicted therein.

It is no coincidence that Fox spends his time looking in a mirror at Vincent, because the mirror is a metaphor in this film. This is an excellent film on all levels. I just reviewed the DVD of ""Spartan"" and ripped on its wooden, unrealistic screenplay. Compare the Spartan screenplay to ""Collateral"" and you can see the difference between an amateur and a professional. Collateral is an excellent film.",1123027200,,652,4.778761061946903

First, Mann's ability to bring the viewer through the camera into the cream of LA nightlife: it's flat surface and glittery light. And second, Tom Cruise's ability to display cold, ruthless intention and an angry darkness. The cinematography is exquisite, and for that alone no serious filmgoer should miss this.

Heat is still my personal favorite: Collateral is highly entertaining itself, but Heat is more hypnotic.  What is most memorable about Collateral, at least to me, is all that driving at night and all that conversation between strangers taking place in the dark of the night, and that alone was worth two hours of my time.  You see, I used to travel on business constantly, constantly fighting with the flight attendants and a variety of other airline employees, and the only time I was at peace was when I was on my way home, riding in a cab or driving in the middle of the night.  I was alone and most peaceful, almost hopeful, and this movie took me back to that place, which was in a strange way a very good place.",1121644800,,829,4.398692810457517

Still, his performance in this film was very good. Tom plays the killer-for-hire, Vincent, who kidnaps Jamie Foxx's taxi driver character, Max, and gets him to drive him to all 5 of the hits he must do in one night. The main problem critics had with it was that they were unable to suspend their disbelief. I disagree to a point. I could believe the taxi driver kidnap point, and the attempts Max makes to escape point, and the blood thirstiness of Vincent point. It was the end, when Max rescues Jada Pinkett Smith that I think the movie lost its edge.",1121212800,2,689,4.348837209302325
1529345,4,B00005JN2Z,"This well-crafted thriller by director Michael Mann offers not only edge-of-the-seat suspense but also solid characterization and cinematic mood.  Jamie Foxx, in an exceptional performance, plays taxi driver Max who still dreams of starting his own business while trapped in his night job of driving fares around LA.  When he inadvertently picks up hit man Vincent (Tom Cruise), everything comes down to survival as his life depends on Vincent's slaughter of others.  Detective Fanning (Mark Ruffalo) is the only one who sees the connectivity of the murders and who may be Max's only chance of rescue.

The surprise of this movie is the acting and chemistry between the two stars, Foxx and Cruise.  Both give their characters depth - and the viewer perversely understands both Vincent's affection for Max and his willingness to kill him.  But Foxx is the man we identify with, not only because his life is in jeopardy, but because of his dreams, his principals, and his mix of fear and astounding bravery.  The viewer is with him every step of the harrowing way.

The soundtrack is good, and the mood created by Mann of a late-night, underbelly LA is exceptional.  The movie has a classiness that many thrillers do not.  Its major flaw is the relative predictability of its final scenes.  While Jada Pinkett Smith turns in a fine supporting performance, she stands in for the typical Hollywood gotta-have woman who motivates the male protagonist.  Her role is all too clear early in the film; however, Mann adeptly diverts the viewer by his suspenseful handling of plot and character.

1529456,5,B00005JN2Z,"Michael Mann has proved to be a consistently impressive source of film-making over the last quarter century. Manhunter, Last of the Mohicans, Heat and The Insider show him at his most versatile and entertaining and are modern classics in their own right. Despite his efforts, he has not enjoyed the amount of box-office success and recognition he deserves. Collateral, his latest project, made great strides in finally brining Mann to the forefront of modern cinematic directors. Not only is it his most accessible film to date, it strongly showcases his greatest strength of creating an engaging storyline with engaging characters. The two leads are perfectly cast, with Cruise going drastically against type as the remorseless Vincent and Foxx matching him stride for stride as the helpless Max.

The two share a unique, strained bond that makes their final showdown both inevitable and gripping. Above it all, Mann's unmistakable flair for his craft shines through. In the hands of a less experienced director, Collateral would have been another run-of-the-mill clichd action vehicle. Thanks to the careful hand of Mann and the pitch perfect performances from Cruise and Foxx, it rises above the normal expectations of the genre and comes through as a fresh and original thrill ride.

If had something else to do, I would have abandoned watching the movie after the first 20 minutes. Luckily, as time went on, it got better. The transformation of Max's character was very well done and the plot actually wasn't bad, it just provided some boring scenes. The conclusion was easily the films best part. It became a fast breath-taking chase in a skyscraper as Max raced to rescue a woman that he had driven in has cab earlier from Vincent. Had the whole movie been as well done as the last thirty minutes it would have been spectacular. Overall not bad but it could have been much better.

But if you can roll with that, you are in for an extremely entertaining ride.

It's really a sort of brainy drama masquerading as an action film. Michael Mann, however, seamlessly brings the two together, and even treats the audience to excellent cinematography! (I saw ""The Interpreter"" after buying the Collateral DVD--big mistake. It made me sick to find that the cinematographic potential in the UN building was squandered.)

Buy the DVD, and don't focus on the main plot too much--focus on the subplots and individual characters. And remember to enjoy it! :D",1120694400,,646,5.211538461538462
1529460,3,B00005JN2Z,"One of the major problems I have with many action movies is that they seemingly attempt to suspend your logic to the point of insulting your intelligence-it really gets to be like a proverbial slap in the face after awhile. This movie, like many of its predecessors, follows some of the action film clich's: ordinary guy getting involved in an event over his head, somehow protagonist must save girl from danger, big car chases where many red lights are run and luckily no innocent citizens are run over, explosions, sharpshooters that somehow miss easy targets but hit difficult ones, the over-drawn chase and fight scenes, etc. For what it is worth, this is an entertaining film. It certainly held my interest for the most part, but it began to wane as the movie progressed. I found the first half of the movie was far more enjoyable than the latter half, and, as the second half unfolded, and with each new chase and each new murder by Cruise, I found myself rolling my eyes more and more at the preposterousness of it all.

For instance, are we actually to believe that sharpshooters from the LAPD and FBI units, as well as security guards are all going to fail to hit Vincent (Cruise's character) in the nightclub?  Equally implausible is the dancing that continues to go on as weapons are drawn, shots are fired, and commands such as ""Put your hands in the air"" and ""This is the FBI"" are being screamed at the club. Some liken Tom Cruise to a human, malevolent Terminator in this movie, and in this segment he plays out this machine-like quality to perfection, as he stoically and unemotionally beats down innocent by-standers and, well, calmly shoots innocent by-standers that happen to be anywhere near Max (Jamie Foxx).

Perhaps a bigger illusion is the ridiculously implausible ending. I don't want to give too much away, but let's just say it involves a car crash, a woman alone in a building, a chase, and two injured people with guns aboard a subway. It really is a let down when a movie tries to go so far over-the-top at the climax and conclusion, and Mann (director) does so at the point after the taxi crash to the extent where many of the ""positives"" of the movie are easily forgotten.

Still, on a lighter note, an aspect of the movie that is rewarding is the acting in itself. Tom Cruise plays his rare role as a bad guy, a hit man, to perfection, and Jamie Foxx does an equally commendable job playing the easy-going cab driver with bigger goals in life. They seem to know their characters well, and it is Max, Foxx's character that shifts from the early part of the movie to the latter part. However, one problem about Foxx's character that was slightly an annoyance was the occasional muttering and mumbling that made his lines indiscernible.

Overall, it was a decent film, but nothing meriting the 5 stars. It is a fun movie and it will be better if you can stretch your imagination and not be bothered by the usual clichs in action films.",1120608000,4,2964,4.606060606060606
1529461,5,B00005JN2Z,"I watched this movie last night and I have to say that it rose far above my expectations.  I expected a lot because of all the hype, but I didn't expect this much.  First off I want to say that Jamie Foxx is somewhat of a hidden trick, I mean, this guy has been around for almost ever and he all of a sudden comanded your attention.  It's almost like he woke up last year and said ""dang, I really need to do something great"" and so he did, with this movie.  My favorite part for Foxx is when his charactor meets with some thugs.  You can see this is the point in the movie when he really BECOMES his charactor.  Anyways, I wanted to say that, and then again I feel I need to point out that Tom Cruise was brilliant.  I really don't like him much at all, I mean, I was saying this the other day to my wife, but Tom Cruise is annoying in person and he's really not that great of an actor but he always picks the BEST movies...My attitude has changed after seeing this movie.  He may still be annoying, but he can act.  So heres the 411...Max (Foxx)is an LA taxi-cab driver who, as you will see, never reaches hard enough for his dreams.  He's living the same routine he live's everyday, scared of change, scared of anything that may be different.  He picks up a woman (Jada), a lawyer working on a big case and he gives her his philosiphy, that you need to take mini breaks, mini vacations throughout the day and he does this by looking at a postcard of an island.  This is important, because the heart of this movie is so much more than a hitman and a cabbie.  Anyways, he says she needs the break more than he does and he gives her the photo.  In return she gives him her number...so now he keeps that in the spot saved for his photo.  SO out gets the girl and in gets the killer.  Vincent (Cruise) has 5 stops to make and offers Max $700 to take him for the night.  He reluctantly agrees (although it would break routine) and he ends up in for the ride of his life.  There are plot twists and turns, especially come the last thirty minutes or so, and the last ten minutes will have your heart beating through your chest.  Heres what I love so much about this movie, because without the underlining moral of this story it would just be a movie, but it's so much more than that.  Max lives life with no purpose, no excitment because he so afraid of anything different.  Vincent is the exact opposite.  He lives for the moment.  Theres a scene in the movie when Vincent is telling Max that one day he will wake up and realive that his dream never happened.  Case in point, Max's dream is to own his own Limo company 'Island Limos' and he tells everyone that taxi-driving is only temp. that he's saving up for his dream, getting things in order...the reality of it all is he been driving for twelve years...that's Vincent's point...he's had this dream for so long it's almost passed, almost gone and soon it will be too late.  There's a balance between two completly different life-styles or attitudes that needs to be met.  Your life should have some order, but not so much that you rule out the unexpected, you rule out the best parts of life because your not ready for them.  The fact of the mater is Vincent was the best thing that ever happened to Max!",1120608000,2,3254,4.240259740259741

He then forces Max to drive him to all of his targets but Max refuses to go down without a fight.. The movie is excellent with a highly original and awesome plot, loads of great action and suspense scenes, one awesome shootout at a nightclub, lots of great humor, and one scene where Vincent completely destroys some punks that steal his briefcase.

1529463,5,B00005JN2Z,"Collateral is one of the best movies of 2004.  Starring Jamie Foxx as Max, a taxi driver who happens to be the victim of bad luck when he picks up a hitman, Tom Cruise (Vincent). What ensues is one of the most dark, yet entertaining movies I've seen. The movie grows in suspense with every ticking moment until the last 25 minutes when everything explodes. Great performance by Jamie Foxx, who later on that year showed even more genius by his performance of The Genius Ray Charles.

There is only one complaint though, and it doesn't have anything to do with the actual movie.  It's the fact that Tom Cruise was once again snubbed by the Academy Awards.  If you ask me, that sucks (for a lack of a better word). He gave, in my opinion, one of his best performances.  That's two movies back to back (The Last Samurai being the other) where he deserved to be nominated but was turned down. I'm not a big Cruise fan myself, but I know a great performance when I see it.

The only way I found out about it was by clicking Audio Options on disc 1, and there you will see the available commentary by Michael Mann, which is dry but informative. Very strange not to promote it - what, are these now going to be like ""easter eggs""?? I admit I was pleasantly surprised to find it. The cinematography is sublime, with terrific blues and greens. I've usually disliked any attempt to shoot features on video, but it is employed to perfection here capturing the cab interior and nighttime cityscape of LA beautifully. It is the best example of the format I've ever seen, so it makes me hopeful that future productions (and technology) will get ever closer to the quality of film stock. It is great to see Cruise play evil, maybe his best performace since TJ Mackey in Magnolia. Foxx of course is a total pro. Jada looks utterly gorgeous. I had some problems with the story as it strains plausibility in MANY scenes, but it's a trade-off made acceptable by superb production values.",1119312000,,1135,4.795918367346939
1529465,5,B00005JN2Z,"It is a Micheal Mann movie, so you can expect great photography, well thought out plot and palpable tension, but the real stand out in this movie for me is Jamie Foxx.  He was able to portray the vunerable taxi driver's anxiety and solitary fear as he drives Tom Cruise's around L.A. killing people.  This is the way to go if you're gonna be a hired killer, don't have to worry about parallel parking and running out of time on those pesky meter parking.  Back to Foxx, he shines in this one.  He's an intelligent, seemingly classically trained actor.  You can't help but feel impress.  Foxx has a comedic face and he is known for comedy but he can also do drama and ""Collateral"" is the proof.  He's come a long way from playing ""LaQueta.""  The movie itself is beaurtiful to look at.  Micheal Mann treated Los Angeles at night like an icy blonde, nice to look at with dangerous underpinnings.  For you folks who used to live in L.A., you might get a little homesick.  The plot and the tension is nicely paced and builds to a frantic ending.  Oh, and  Cruise is very convincing as a high priced killer,  although his character could have done without the powderd, gray hair.  It made him look anemic.  The DVD has some nice extras, you see the attention that Mann, Foxx, and Cruise gave to this project and that's why this DVD is so highly recommmended.",1119225600,,1352,4.457142857142857
1529555,4,B00005JN2Z,"For the most part, this is one sharp crime thriller that doubles as a character study of two lonely men. If that premise does not appeal to you, then you probably can't appreciate director Michael Mann's unique filmmaking style, which is an intoxicating mix of nocturnal urban sleekness and characters that peel off layers of their psyche to drive the plot. This is not a standard action film, not by a long shot, as it is really about the relationship between a hit man named Vincent and a cab driver named Max, thrown together by chance and becoming more inextricably connected as the convoluted story unfolds. Vincent is as mono-maniacally cold-blooded as one can expect in this type of film, but Stuart Beattie's script reveals a well-educated, rather erudite man who may have been triggered by an abusive childhood to follow this line of work. In salt-and-pepper hair and without his trademark smile, Tom Cruise is relatively good as Vincent, though as with most of his films, there is an air of posturing about his performance that negates the malice of his character. At the same time, when it comes to his character's profession, he is convincing as an expert at his craft, who has mastered a clear method of killing that absolves him of blame and conscience.

The focal point of this 2004 film, however, is Max, who represents the story's moral conscience. He is also a complex figure, a man who has deluded himself with dreams of running his own limousine service. Max makes it sound convincing at first, but then his credibility starts to unravel under Vincent's astute microscope and as the immediate situation becomes more desperate. Consequently, he is forced not only to drive Vincent around LA but also to look at himself for what he is. Were it not for his uncanny impersonation of Ray Charles, this is the performance that would have pushed Jamie Foxx to the front ranks. As Max, he captures all the inner conflict showing surprising pockets of courage when he realizes he has nothing to lose. The interplay between Vincent and Max is what makes this film uniquely intriguing, as it is just not about a villain holding a reluctant victim hostage but about two men who leverage each other's blind spots and weaknesses to fulfill their immediate goals.

Too infrequent on the screen recently, Jada Pinkett-Smith is sharp and memorable in a small but pivotal role as Annie, a federal prosecutor who gets drawn to Max at the beginning. Mark Ruffalo, taking a break from indies, is effective as the slicked-back LA detective who is not sure who his suspect is. Irma P. Hall has a briefly comic scene as Max's bedridden mother. Special mention needs to be given to the wondrous Javier Bardem, who takes a 180-degree turn from his recent saintly roles to play a single scene as the drug kingpin Felix, coolly menacing as he talks facetiously about Humpty Dumpty, Santa Claus and Black Peter. The scene between Foxx and Bardem is superbly played out as Max gradually steels himself into Vincent's identity. Mann's set pieces - in a scary Latin bar, in a frenzied Koreatown dance club - show the director at the height of his stylized creativity, and nighttime in LA has never looked more terrifyingly hypnotic than in the excellent camerawork by cinematographers Paul Cameron and Dion Beebe.

It's a shame that the film gets more predictable toward the end when Vincent becomes his most nihilistic and Terminator-like and Max unconditionally heroic. In a fit of derivativeness, the story suddenly borrows heavily from ""Rear Window"" and ""Speed"" with a touch of ""The French Connection"". Although the cumulative effect is still suspenseful, the familiarity of the climax left me feeling a little empty especially after the plot was unfolding in such an audaciously creative manner. But I still recommend this movie for its overall originality. The two-disc set has plenty of extras - Mann's informative commentary, a feature-length making-of documentary, an interesting prep reel of Cruise and Foxx getting into their roles and just one deleted scene. Well worthwhile even if you are not a fan of this genre.",1119139200,3,4115,4.917985611510791
1529556,4,B00005JN2Z,"Though large chunks of the ""Collateral"" plot are preposterous, taken with a pinch of salt and tongue in cheek, it's a highly entertaining thrill ride through the streets of Los Angeles, while cab driver Jamie Foxx is taken hostage by sociopath hit man Tom Cruise. Foxx spends the night from hell as Cruise uses his cab for ""work,"" and tries to find a way out of his predicament.
The film looks great, with lots of dazzling overhead shots of a bright lights and glitter LA, and it sounds good too, with a score by James Newton Howard, and some pleasant non-original music. There are many moments of humor with some witty lines between the two leads, who have a marvelous ""anti-chemistry"" between them, and director Michael Mann keeps the pace so fast, that as we zip from scene to scene, we don't fully realize how absurd the story is.

The cast is excellent; Cruise with gray hair and beard is in one of his best recent roles, and portrays the sadistic Vincent with a cool and cutting edge, and Foxx is terrific as the beleaguered cabbie Max. Both are in peak athletic shape, and do their share of some fast running. Jada Pinkett Smith is beautiful as a prosecuting attorney, but it is a thankless role, and she is not much more than a plot device. Others in the cast include Spanish actor (and new international star) Javier Bardem in a small part as Felix, Mark Ruffalo as Fanning, and Peter Berg as Weidner.

I'll have to admit that the premise was intriguing to say the least, but ultimately the back and forth banter between Cruise & Fox is what elevated this film into a nerve wracking, white knuckle suspense ride; halfway through you're not sure if you're strapped in properly, but you don't care, because what's going down on screen is so damn cool.  I actually found myself wishing I'd seen this in theaters.  Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed the viewing experience.

The level of cruelty and violence Cruise's assassin displays was altogether unexpected.  It's absurd and flinch worthy, almost cartoony at times, but it always is presented with flair and style.  In fact the whole movie comes off as something you might see in a graphic novel.  Pretty cool stuff to see get Hollywood backing.

Also, as a very nice added bonus feature you get the incredibly beautiful Jada Pinkett Smith (that Fresh Prince is one heckuva lucky guy) as the damsel in distress.

When all is said and done what you get is a witty action/drama that never seems to let up.  I imagine any taxi driver after seeing this film became very wary of picking up white haired Caucasians.  That alone is hilarious enough to make me recommend this movie.",1118361600,,1469,4.804780876494024
1529558,4,B00005JN2Z,"I just read a long review on Amazon by a reviewer who said some pretty intelligent things about Michael Mann's direction. It made for an interestin read really. Sadly,I haven't followed his films but he does manage to raise an important point. The Audioslave track does indeed not match the pace of the film and the time it was played. There was substantial few precious seconds devouted to it though.

To deny this film from what it deserves would be criminal. I can safely say Tom Cruise proves himself time and again as one of the best actors time has seen. He will be remembered by someone in the 22nd century as a man of great devoution to what he was good at. Jamie Foxx's character on the other hand was what be a mixture of morality and individuality. There wasn't much of a proportion between the two but he turned into a righteous individualist in the film when it mattered.

I must add it's not easy to make such precise paced flicks. There's nothing predictable to me. I quite liked the discussion of reality checks between Foxx and Cruise which made one of them go crazy. Also the discussion of Miles Davis in a jazz bar was more interesting than what I can possibly try and comprehend.

All in all,this film would go down in my memory lane as one of the best directed action/thriller films I have seen in a long time. It's not easy to make a film about just one night and spread out in a chain of events leading to one another and making it all look terrificly well done.

What I disliked about the film was its limited outlook. No,dont get me wrong because even if I try I couldn't find a flaw in the film that would make me stomp my foot hard. It's just that it perfectly fits the four star grade.

And oh yes,Tom Cruise's suit fits him like silver skin. He's a bit of a Terminator 2 villain in this film and I'm sure a lot of people would love to watch this side of the man.

1. this is a michael mann movie, which implies boring aerial shots from a helicopter that was rented out using the majority of the budget
2. there will be unbearably awful music to drown out the nauseating dialogue
3. there will be an easily predictable showdown at the end that will be taut yet tender enough as to be ready for public consumption - deviating from formulaic action rules and endings would be asking far too much of what little intelligence he gives his audience
4. people will inexplicably shower it with the kind of hosannas and praise usually reserved for bearded messianic figures

aside from that and the buzz surrounding the performances in the film, i was relatively unaware with what the movie concerned.  i was told by various sources (none of whom i should trust in matters of cinema) that it was imperious that i see the film.  i acquiesced and borrowed the film (i'd be damned if i'd give a penny to the (...)that made ""ali"") from my girlfriend's brother.

i permitted an ounce of optimism to slip under my usually impenetrable derma of cold, practiced cynicism and actually began to enjoy the film.  aside from mann's patented abrasive camera work everything seemed to be headed in a positive direction.  however, i must have forgotten the rule that anything containing jada pinkett smith will be incontrovertibly bad, because i foresaw good things in the flick's future.  sure it was nothing beyond a solid action film, but it was one that didn't insult my intelligence - which is a rarity.  then of course it had to come up with the most boiled down ending imaginable.

what went wrong?

the performances are not the culpable party.  certainly foxx's overplayed tics and banal stuttering began to grate the nerves after the first hour or so, and cruise's character wasn't so much a character as he was a composite of all the previous antagonists in mann's ouevre - but everyone seemed to have a grip on what the script and screenwriter considered a character.  it was in all honesty great fun to watch tom cruise execute people in such detached precision, and i'm never one to object the mass extermination of nameless ancillary characters written for the sole purpose of being murdered in aesthetically stimulating ways.  as a matter of fact my enjoyment was thorough and unquestionable up until the point when an audioslave song came on, then i remembered precisely why i disliked michael mann movies.  mann lacks an acute sense that most great directors have and flaunt.  namely, he lacks control.  certainly, the way his movies move imply calculation, but upon further investigation one can see that tapestry of lies unravel and end up in frayed tatters on the floor.  he becomes intoxicated on his own style and over-indulges where he shouldn't.  he can't restrain himself properly and doesn't know his weak areas, and since this air of nobility pervades his person and he's looked on as some kind of icon nobody has the chutzpah to tell him otherwise.  he juggles so many things at once that he's like a drunk trying to compose himself, but he's so inebriated that he can't maintain his balance.  so instead of giving up we see him fumble and fit all over the pavement.

mann's incompetence as a director would be forgivable were it not for the unmitigated absurdity of the climax.  the very instant that foxx discovered smith was to be the next target, i lost would little faith i had invested in the movie.  it had led me to believe that it was an anomoly, that it wasn't just your standard ho-hum action movie, and then i get a ridiculous david mamet-like plot twist thrust under my nose that renders me incapable of doing anything but scoffing at the final moments of the movie.  the people responsible for the movie are requiring that i suspend too much of my intelligence by inferring that i should:
a) presume a sensible human being engaged in freelance assassination would prefer to rely on a cabbie as his transportation, making him easily susceptible to detection (especially when he's done it before)
b) hear audioslave and not laugh uproariously (which i did immediately after hearing one of their awful ""ballads"" in one of the scenes)
c) see jada pinkett smith and not desparately wish her immense physical harm
d) put aside the fact that tom cruise executed an entire nightclub while breakdancing with his hands behind his back, pulling the trigger with his tongue and aiming the gun with his aquiline beak, but couldn't hit one man at point blank range on a subway car, and that in turn said man (who is considerably unexperienced with firearms) could land one kill shot on him in an exchange of gunfire

this movie didn't challenge my expectations in the least.  it was formulaic, predictable, hard to discern from pretty much every jerry bruckheimer flick i've ever seen in my life, and eventually devolved into an audioslave music video.  however, if you're the sort of person that requires his cinema only provide him/her with the lowest modicum of entertainment, then collateral should do suitably, for it is entertaining - just not what i wanted at this particular moment, especially after seeing cruise expand his acting chops in the criminally ignored and defamed ""magnolia.""

Not taking anything away from the actors, Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise are both Magnificent as the consciencious taxi driver and the cool cold blooded killing machine.

The story is as follows: a taxi driver picks up a fare from a Businessman, who claims he has to make 5 stops to tie up estate dealings. Foxx is bribed into this with a cool 600 dollers and everything looks innocent enough until....well Foxx finds out that Cruise is a contract killer and plays a good part as the taxi driver who has a crisis of conscience, should he risk his own life to save that of other innocent people?

On the way there is minor involvement from Cruises boss 'Felix' and the FBI, but the main part of the film is the interaction between Cruise and Foxx.

Unfortunately its impossible for me to say how the film gets formulaic without spoling the ending. Anyway its well worth a rental but not a classic action film to add to your collection

*************Spolier******************

The best Review ive read of this is SinisterFiend, because too many of these reviews concentrate on the brilliant acting, and not enough on the fact that the interaction Foxx has with that woman is obviously going to esculate into some ridiculous cat and mouse chase between the killer and the hero, with his token woman.

  Also how could cruise not take foxx out? Foxx didn't look too adept with the handgun (forgetting to take the safety off is a sure sign).

  theres also no background on the killings except that they might be quite important. In short i was left dissapointed with the ending.",1116633600,,1667,4.671232876712328
1529634,5,B00005JN2Z,"In the past few years, I have fallen away from movies with Tom Cruise in them, feeling that he just hasn't been hitting the mark lately.  But under the direction of Michael Mann, Tom Cruise finds his pacing and delivers one of the best performances of his career.  Combine his character with the recent explosion of Jamie Foxx and you have the makings of a great movie.  Both Cruise and Foxx guide COLLATERAL to its explosive conclusion, all the while managing to shed light on their characters and explore real emotion.  I just could not find something not to like about this film while watching it.  The opening sequences are great, the dialogue is superb, and the imagery is extraordinary.  Los Angeles comes alive in COLLATERAL and Mann's picture seems to be a tribute to its scenic locations and nightlife.  I even noticed the quality of the soundtrack, not normally something to which I pay an inordinate amount of attention.

Ultimately, I found COLLATERAL interesting because of the depth of its two main characters.  Take Cruise's character, for instance.  I was expecting a typical ""hitman"" character: no sense of morality, quick-decision maker, etc.  But what we get is someone who brings complexity to his position, someone who seems to develop a friendship & care for the cabdriver who has been ushering him around all night, someone who behind all of the grime has a personal code of ethics.  Of course, at the end of the day he is what he is.  But Cruise manages to squeeze a lot more life into the character than I had expected, particularly in the scenes where we learn about his childhood experiences.  Opposite Cruise stands Foxx, a simple cabdriver who has been putting off his dreams for twelve years, afraid of the commitment and the responsibility.  But he is also a man capable of great heroism and courage, witnessed several times throughout the film in short bursts.

What I really loved about COLLATERAL, however, is how it manages to communicate the haphazard nature of life.  The opening sequence is particularly illustrative as Cruise only ends up in Foxx's cab as an accident.  Small decisions in this film have ripple effects that change the course of each characters' life.  This is not a film of fate.  It is a film of personal free will and the chaos of our decisions.  It is a film that preaches agency over the chains of predetermined outcomes.  And it transforms the audience as it transforms its characters.  COLLATERAL is one of Michael Mann's best films to date and an absolute must-see for everyone.",1116028800,,2541,4.804147465437788

The action was non-stop and had you later wanting to tell your friends about the cool moves Tom pulls, especially in the dance club sequence. It was oddly humorous, in a morbid kind of way. The way Vincent, Tom's character, refers to the people he has just knocked off makes you grin a little, even though you know you shouldn't. Vincent is an assassin, and even though he is bad, is a likable guy. Jamie Foxx was marvelous as well, and makes you really feel for Max, his character. The movie ends in a show down between Max and Victor, and I was not sure whom I wanted to win. The movie leaves you with a rather poetic message, with the loser saying, ""How long do you think it'll be befor anyone knows I'm dead."" This movie is a must see, trust me on this one.",1114819200,2,878,4.140350877192983
1529639,4,B00005JN2Z,"Going into this movie, I tried to push expectations out of my mind. The plotline sounded interesting, and appeared to have potential, but based on the previews it also looked like the kind of film that could easily flop if not handled with care. Luckily, ""Collateral"" did not disappoint me and, while not perfect, was even a bit better than I'd hoped. Max (Jamie Foxx) is an LA cab driver. Vincent (Tom Cruise) is a professional contract killer with five hits to make in a single night. Upon his arrival in the city, he hails a cab. By coincidence, it happens to be Max's. (It's not clear why he didn't just rent a car and thus save himself from entanglement with a witness to his murders, but this can be overlooked without too much effort.) As Vincent and Max make the rounds of LA, ticking victims off the list one by one, a police detective (Mark Ruffalo) notices the strange similarities between two homicide cases (Vincent's victims) brought into the morgue, and the chase is on.

The bulk of the movie is driven by tension and suspense in the build up to the climactical cat-and-mouse chase scene at the end. This sense of building tension is accentuated by the innovative use of an orchestral soundtrack, making for an interesting musical background. One thing that pleased me is that ""Collateral"" is slightly more intelligent in nature than a lot of action movies, and thus is not readily predictable. You're never entirely sure what will happen next, nor is it apparent how the film will end. Unfortunately, the ending itself leaves a little to be desired. There is so much build up that the climax of the film, by comparison, seems somewhat flat, and the conclusion is not altogether satisfying. There isn't a real sense of resolution, and the viewer is left wanting a little something more.

The choices in setting and cinematography are interesting, and effective. Much of the movie has a bit of a ""Phone Booth""-esque feel to it. Though an action film, a lot of that action takes place in a very confined space, in or in close proximity to the taxicab that is the central element of the storyline. And it is not JUST an action movie, either, but has an emotional element that allows one to connect with the main characters to a higher degree. Director Michael Mann has also made creative choices in where and how the various scenes were shot, enhancing the film's impact. You can gain a particular appreciation for his skill and eye for detail by watching the featurettes ""City of Night"" and ""Visual FX"" on the second disc.

The acting was competent all around. Jamie Foxx is particularly good as the hero in the film. It was interesting to see Tom Cruise as a villain. He has never struck me as an actor whose characters have much depth, and I find that his movies (the ones that work, anyway) are generally carried more by plotline and action, but he is convincing here. I would not go so far as to say his role here stands out above the other work he has done, but he does manage to make the antagonist of the story startlingly charismatic, playing on our emotional allegiances right up to the last few sequences of the film, where he simply becomes ruthless and cold. Mark Ruffalo plays his part well, but his limited parts never really allow him to step forward into the viewer's attention. Another character I would like to have seen more of is Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith), the romantic interest of the film. While she has a strong presence when on screen, and cuts an impressive figure as a strong and professional lawyer, her character is used primarily as a tool to drive the plot forward, and not as a personality in and of herself.

While I did enjoy the movie, there are a few areas where it falls short. While I liked the premise, which stands out a bit from your average run-of-the-mill action flick, it fails to deliver any real punch that makes you sit back and go ""Wow!"" when the film is over. As I mentioned earlier, the ending is a little flat, a little lacking, creating more of a ""That's it?"" sentiment. Also, the movie has little replay value. While quite entertaining on a first-time viewing, it primarily holds the audience's attention via suspense, and once you know what happens, there isn't much else to dig into on subsequent viewings. The characters, while likeable, are not particularly memorable, nor are there many quotable lines. It's a good movie to rent once when you're in the mood for a suspenseful action ride, but it's not the kind of film you're likely to want to watch on a regular basis.

The DVD extras are worth watching. ""City of Night"" is a longer featurette on the making of the film, which provides interesting insights on Mann's various filmmaking choices. ""Special Delivery"" gives a little information on how Tom Cruise prepared for his role as Vincent. ""Shooting on Location"" takes you into the cinematography of the film. ""Visual FX"" is a particularly interesting segment on the movie's cinematography. There is also one deleted scene, with commentary, and a piece called ""Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx Rehearse,"" which is just that - a sequence of rehearsal recordings for various scenes in the film. Overall, a DVD worth renting. It isn't one I'd add to my personal collection, but it was an enjoyable viewing experience.",1114732800,,5283,4.688577586206897
1529640,3,B00005JN2Z,"Let me start off by saying that Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise are good actors, and they both did a good job in this movie working together. This is probably the best movie I have seen Tom Cruise do in a long time. The movie is interesting enough to draw you in, and it manages to entertain. In the end though, to me it was just ""ok"" movie. I thought the taxi cab scenes where over done, by that I mean most of the movie is spent in the cab with Cruise talking to Foxx. To me, this got a little old. **Spoilers warning** I also thought some of the writing was poor in this movie. Starting with the beginning of the movie, You already know the girl his going to play a part in the end of the movie, and within the first 20 minutes of the movie, you will know how everything is going to go down in the final scene. To me it was predictable. Some more poor writing can be seen during the bridge sequence. No one grabs a brief case owned by a guy with a gun and throws it into traffic. You would get shot, besides this, what does Jamie Foxx do after throwing the brief case? Stands there! If you just threw a briefcase over a bridge that you stolen from a man with a gun. You would chuck it and run! Not stand their waiting for him while putting up you hands. Instead of running, he stands their and waits for cruise to catch up and draw his gun on him. I thought that was stupid. One other example of poor writing, that you see in a lot of action movies, is the ending. Here we have a whole movie with Tom Cruise shooting people with DEADLY accuracy.  He can take out select targets in a night club, hitting them sqaure on from a distance in a mob of moving people. However, when it comes to the final scene in the movie, he can't take out 2 people? What happened to Mr. dead shot? Anyway, it was a good / ok movie. It is worth a rental, but I wouldn't own it, or probably watch it again, but it wasn't bad either.

1529641,4,B00005JN2Z,"Nominated for two Academy Awards, Collateral is an electrifying, high-energy drama about a paid assassin who kidnaps a cab driver in order to carry out his work. With a high quality performance by Jamie Foxx, Collateral is a movie that draws viewer interest with relative ease. Tom Cruise turns in an outstanding performance as the noted hit man, and Jada Pinkett Smith enjoys one of her most notable performances as a high profile lawyer. One of the most action-packed movies of 2004, Collateral is an unforgettable glimpse into the world of professional assassins. You won't want to miss it...

Los Angeles taxicab driver Max (Jamie Foxx) is an easy to get along with guy, a guy with big dreams of owning his own company and vacationing on a beautiful Caribbean island. When he picks up an unusually beautiful fare, an attorney named Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith), the two hit it off real well. Before Annie leaves, she hands Max her card and the two agree to go out on a date later. However, Max's next fare has other ideas in mind...

When Max picks up the silver-haired, well-dressed Vincent, he thinks he's got himself just another paying customer. But Max is actually a highly trained professional hit man, and he wants to utilize Max's services for the entirety of the night - as he takes out each of his allotted victims. Regardless of the money flashed in his face, Max doesn't want anything to do with the killings, but Vincent threatens to kill Max if he doesn't comply.

The result is a night in which Vincent methodically carries out his hits, while Max becomes human collateral, used by Vincent in a war between the drug cartel going before a grand jury in federal court and the only witnesses who can take the cartel down. As Vincent commits each of his killings, the police follow up with an investigation of their own. Slowly, they put the pieces together. Past killings similar in nature occurred in LA in years past and were always topped off by a dead cab driver at the end of the evening. As the cops chase after them, the fate of both Vincent and Max become intertwined. By means of Vincent's manipulations, Max becomes a tool who's enlisted to act in other capacities besides driving.

As the night wears on, and Vincent approaches the conclusion of his killing spree, the identity of his last victim becomes glaringly clear... Annie, a federal prosecutor working diligently on the drug cartel's indictment, is the final hit on Vincent's list. Now separated from each other, Max must hunt down Vincent and put an end to his killing before he takes out Annie...

Wrought with suspense and a number of high-energy action sequences, Collateral is an enjoyable film. The blood and gore is not excessive, and the violence is tempered with comic relief and the interesting banter and evolving relationship between Vincent and Max. And the onscreen relationship between the two characters makes for a great movie. With some the best performances of Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise's respective careers, Collateral is a definite must-see film...

1529643,4,B00005JN2Z,"Michael Mann is one of my favorite directors. He creates films filled with interesting characters, involving stories and production design all of which really help to create the world his films inhabit. When ""Collateral"" was released in theaters, I heard and read more than one review that stated ""Michael Mann returns to the Los Angeles streets in `Collateral'"" or something similar. It seems as though he is being typecast. In a good way, this is understandable. He is the director of ""Heat"", one of the best crime dramas ever made, an epic starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, a sprawling film showing characters on both sides of the law as they make the streets of Los Angeles their personal battle ground. And he is the director of ""Collateral"", another film set in Los Angeles, this time during the course of one evening, as a hit man travels throughout the city, fulfilling his latest contract. In a bad way, this severely limits the breadth and scope of this director. He has also directed ""Last of The Mohicans"", starring Daniel Day Lewis and Madeline Stowe, one of the most romantic films ever made. ""The Insider"" and ""Ali"" are also on his resume, two very different dramas of mixed result. Perhaps we should simply typecast him as a great director and move on with it.

""Collateral"" follows Vincent Vega (Tom Cruise, sporting graying hair) as he travels throughout Los Angeles one night, fulfilling his contract. Presumably, because he is just visiting, he doesn't rent a car. Maybe he can't drive. Maybe he's from the East Coast and doesn't have a car. This part of his character is vague. For whatever reason, Vincent uses cabs to get around while in LA. At a downtown office building, he jumps into the cab of Max (Jamie Foxx), a man with a dream, who tries to make the best of his days. Max has just dropped off a woman that he is extremely interested in, Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith) and still daydreaming. He quietly takes Vincent to his first stop, stating that it will take 7 minutes. It does take seven minutes and this impresses Vincent. He asks Max to take him to all of his stops for the rest of the evening; he'll double his usual take. Max eyes the money and agrees. Waiting for his Fare, Max starts eating his dinner, daydreaming, until a body crashes into the top of his cab.

Much like ""Heat""'s blue landscape and sun-drenched backdrops, ""Collateral"" goes the opposite direction with equally stunning results. Mann and his crew used a DV Camera for the film. Using a digital camera is a gutsy move and provides a unique look for the film, enhancing the atmosphere. The story actually begins in the late afternoon and every image is crystal clear, much like watching a HD TV. As the light wanes, the images become darker and grainier. When the characters move to a brightly lit area, their faces pop out in sharp relief, but the backgrounds are still grainy. This makes the characters appear as though they are walking among two-dimensional backdrops. When they enter a brightly lit building, everything becomes crystal clear again. Mann is using this as another way of indicating what the characters are feeling and experiencing during these scenes.

The story is about as simple as they come. Vega has received his contract and has a fancy tablet-like computer with pictures, addresses, schedules, etc. of each of the victims. He announces to Max that he has five stops, so the viewer has a timeline of sorts, very clearly on. Basically, a two-character set piece, the film is about Max and Vincent. How they interact, how they change each other, what they learn from each other and more. At one point, Vincent learns that Max has a mom in the hospital and he drags Max to the hospital for a visit. They become a sort of guardian angel to each other. As they make their way to the various stops, Max, the good guy, continues to look for a way to stop Vincent. They stop at a Jazz club, a Latino nightclub, a nightclub in Koreatown. Each of these stops introduces a new, interesting character into the mix, however briefly.

Less successful, and necessary, are the action scenes. Because the film is essentially a character piece about two people interacting over a single night, big action scenes don't really fit. At the Koreatown club, in particular, the action seems excessive, over the top and unnecessary. Cruise's acting in this scene rivals Pacino's ham-fisted dialogue delivery in ""Heat"". I'm not knocking Pacino in ""Heat"", but he is ham-fisted. With the exception of the Koreatown club and the finale, the action scenes are smaller and lower key, which fits perfectly into the story. I am more willing to accept the action of the finale, but it also seems a bit obtrusive. Because it is the finale, and it is foreshadowed at the beginning of the film, it seems to fit more generically.

During the 2004 Academy Awards, there was a lot of talk about how Jamie Foxx ""almost stole the film"" from Tom Cruise. What this means is that people felt Foxx did a better job in this film than his more famous co-star. This is incredibly subjective, but each of them portrayed characters that were different for them. Foxx, who began his rise to fame on TV's ""In Living Color"", was more well-known for his comedic work. In ""Collateral"", and later ""Ray"", he shows remarkable skill at drama. In ""Collateral"", his character is quiet, observant and a bit of a loser. He comments that the job driving a cab is just temporary; he's working on things, trying to get a business started. When Vincent asks him how long he's been driving a cab, Max answers 12 years. There's nothing temporary about it. We then realize that he is a dreamer who has never, and will never realize his dreams. Max becomes all the more real because of this. Cruise has become one of the world's biggest stars playing heroes. So it was a risk for him to take the role of Vincent, a cold- blooded killer. Like most of Cruise's films, he brings an intensity to the role that fits the character. Cruise's role is the more showy, and noticeable, but it was probably less of a stretch for him to pull off than Foxx's performance. Because of this, Foxx is receiving the lion's share of attention. Both performances are very good. Mark Ruffalo, Peter Berg, Javier Barden and Barry Shabake Henley (a very recognizable character actor) pop up during Max and Vincent's travels. Ruffalo has the most extended supporting role, and is the most successful with it.

""Collateral"" was released in theaters during the summer of 2004, and it, and ""The Bourne Supremacy"" signaled that perhaps the studios have realized that there is a market out there for adult action films. ""Collateral"" is a very good film that will take you along for the ride.",1113264000,,6721,4.710884353741497
1529742,3,B00005JN2Z,"Collateral is the kind of movie for which the term ""mixed bag"" was invented.  On the one hand it's an immensely entertaining watch, full of high style, expansive cinematography, and explosive action.  On the other it's at times almost insultingly unrealistic, marred by contrivances, gaps in logic and one of the more implausible endings in cinematic history.  In spite of its flaws it's still more than serviceable entertainment if you don't think about it too hard, and it's certainly about as good a crime thriller as you're going to get from Hollywood these days.  In other words, it's worth watching, but it's certainly not anywhere near the level of Reservoir Dogs, Heat, or other recent masterpieces of its genre.

The premise is a perfect example of what's both good and bad about the movie.  The idea of a top hitman getting a cab driver to chaffeur him around on his hits is an intriguing one, even if it's not all that hard to poke holes in.  That any of this works at all is due largely to the efforts of directors Michael Mann and the movie's two leads, namely Tom Cruise as Vincent (the killer) and Jamie Foxx as Max (the cabbie).  This movie relies far more heavily on character than most of its ilk, and the success of Foxx and Cruise in their respective roles is largely responsible for pulling it through its less-than-steller parts.

Of all the reasons to watch this movie, I can think of none more compelling than Cruise's brilliant scenery chewing in his change-of-pace bad guy role as a contract killer with a busy night ahead of him. In The Last Samurai, Cruise played a character who started in the gutter and climbed out; in Collateral, he appears to be having a great time reveling in the gutter. Cruise's Vincent is a model of amorality, the kind of character who's so delightfully malevolent that you just can't stop watching. This guy's like a more charming version of the Terminator, cutting a swath of destruction though L.A. when he's not engaging in deep conversation and dispensing nihilistic philosophy with Max. The scene where Vincent shoots, kicks, and punches his way through a crowded club to get to a hapless witness resembles something out of a John Woo movie, only with better production values.

Mann's direction is a huge plus as well.  He's always shown a willingess to deviate from the standard and challenge his audience a bit (the recent Ali being a prime example), and Collateral is no exception.  The tense, manic plotting is accompanied by an equal number of corresponding shifts in tone, as Mann mixes unflinching violence with striking characterization. Really, it's this emphasis on letting us get to know its two central figures that makes the movie.  It's easy to miss at first, but the interactions between Max and Vincent go a lot deeper than initial appearances suggest as Vincent's personality begins to increasingly rub off on Max.  It's easy to see why: Max is a nice guy but basically a doormat, stuck in a ""temporary"" job driving a cab for 12 years, reduced to lying to his hospitalized mother about running a limo service.  Vincent may be a calculating, murderous sociopath, but he's also everything Max isn't: assertive, strong-willed, and most of all free from the petty moral and practical concerns that plague most of us on a daily basis.  And in an extreme situation like the one Max is faced with, it's a lot better to be like Vincent than like, well, himself.

The first three quarters of Collateral are especially compelling, as Mann puts his two lead actors through a series of superbly executed set pieces interrupted only by the aforementioned cab scenes and a relatively gratuitous subplot that strands Mark Ruffalo (a good actor) in a rather thankless role as a cop investigating the case.  Unfortunately, after building up an hour and a half worth of goodwill, Collateral suddenly turns from an atmospheric thriller with action in it to a formulaic action movie replete with ludicrous ending and accompanying hacky twist.  Much of what happens before the final act is somewhat farfetched, but it's at least within the realm of possibility.  On the other hand, almost nothing that occurs in the last half hour of this movie is even remotely believable.  I don't want to give away too much (although others already have), but those who have seen the movie will know what I mean.  The ending notwithstanding, however, if you're into crime movies Collateral should suffice for at least one viewing.  You could certainly do a lot worse.",1113004800,27,4511,4.82987012987013

Just from the moment Collateral started I was glued to the screen. This film's taut atmoshpere, great dialogue, and great acting from Foxx and Cruise makes this an extremely watchable thriller.
Jamie Foxx plays Max, an LA cab driver who inadvertently gets involved with the murders of 5 people from a hitlist being carried out by a contract killer named ""Vincent"" played by Tom Cruise. I won't go into details, but this storyline is executed very well and doesn't get confusing or complicated at all like what happens with a lot of films of this nature.
And there can't be enough said about the performances from Foxx and Cruise in this one. Playing almost parallel-like characters (Max a hard working man trying to make ends meet who values people and their company, Vincent a contract killer who values no one's life) made watching Foxx and Cruise on the screen a very interesting thing to watch.

It is certainly one to add to your collection: there are so many classic scenes. Max cleaning the car versus the broken windshield and scattered sandwich. Max reading the Mercedes catalog yet driving a taxi for 10 or 11 years. Vincent and the classic line about the fact that he didn't kill him, 'the bullet and the fall killed him'. As for Mr. Cruise. I don't know where he learned to shoot, but he actually handles that pistol like a real contract killer (and no i don't know any!). He looks like a guy who could get 2 rounds only a few centimeters apart. Again it has been said that the role was created for the way he acts and i think this could well be true. I certainly do not like the terminator stuff at the end, jumping on the back of trains is for Arnie not Cruise. I am a big M.Mann film buff and this certainly goes up there with Heat for intensity and realism (except the aforementioned terminator stuff).  The music is EXCELLENT.

1529810,1,B00005JN2Z,"So, listen---a guy dies on the Metrorail, right? And he does loop-de-loops around L.A. for six hours, and nobody notices, you know?

So the real question is this: if a hitman gets gunned down on the LA metro-rail, and nobody hears him die, does the movie really stink up the joint?

The answer is: definitely yes. The fact that Michael Mann produced this dog, which has made-for-TeeVee written all over it, is astounding, perplexing, and more than a little sad.

If you haven't been hiding in a cave above Kabul for the last three years, then you probably know the preposterous premise behind Collateral's wafer-thin plot: hitman (Tom Cruise, with ugly grey flannel suit and ugly silver hair) blows into town with list of victims, hires cabbie (Jamie Foxx, who tries manfully to fake a working man) to take him to Points A, B, C, D and E.

Never mind the stupidity of the premise: what professional hitman, ferried in by Colombian druglords to slaughter the witnesses in a major federal sting, is gonna trust his precious, deadly mission to the hands of some random schmo he picks up at LAX? Let's go by the numbers, alright?

1) Every professional hitman works hard to blend in to the scenery by frosting his hair silver, wearing Agent Smith-style refracting wrap-arounds, and donning a dress-to-impress grey suit---especially in LA, where business-formal is defined by the length of your Bermuda shorts;

2)Every professional hitman in LA with a high priority job to do hires a cab to ferry him to his destination. Because, you know, cabs are the---ummmm---most efficient way to go if you're carrying off a major hit and want no witnesses. Right.

3) In a major federal drug trial, none of the witnesses, let alone the prosecutor, are provided with even the most rudimentary police protection, even when it's evident someone is bumping them off one by one.

4) LA Federal buildings have just one crummy security guard, even on the eve of a major trial involving a Colombian drug cartel.

5) If you're a high-profile international assassin, it's a great idea to leave all your critical assassin files locked up in a big obvious black briefcase that you dangle around in front of your hijacked cabbie and anyone else he thinks of tossing the thing to.

6)If you're director Michael Mann, you're obviously too successful to worry about choreagraphing a coherent, visually compelling action sequence in the dance-club ""Fever"". Far better to just let things go, in random chaotic fashion, for about 10 minutes, and then call it a rap. Oh yeah, and did I mention? If you're a federal witness on the eve of a major Drug trial and you hear gunshots and the screams of the dying in a club you're chowing down in, it's better just to ignore it and keep eating sushi. Maybe it will go away.

7) If Jada Pinkett Smith gets hired to do what would amount to a three-second throwaway role at the start of a flick, it must mean she's coming back for seconds. Or that she's tied into the plot in a big way. Right? Right?

8)An expert shot will always miss the hero in a totally unpopulated LA subway terminal, but the hero will always be able to bring down the baddie with one lucky shot.

9) When you run out of interesting dialogue/expositions, following a cab using an aerial shot of LA always helps. It lends, like, you know, credibility, man. Big City stuff. Word.

10) When chartering a cab for your hit, it's always a good idea to shoot your first victim so he flies out the window and does some major hood and windshield damage to the cab. That way the cops know who to look for.

Aside from one scene---a nasty little set-piece with a jazz trumpet player, which ends with a brutal little coda---I've seen all of ""Collateral"", any of ""Collateral"", on about 1000 TV-cop shows over the last decade. Everything here has been done, done better, a million times before.

Move along folks---there's nothing to see here.

Max accepts, but realizes that Vincent is a hitman who has been hired to kill five people that night.

Foxx, up until now, has been reduced to your typical funny black guy roles in nearly every one of his movies.

The movie is directed perfectly, with silences and cinematography that capture the emptiness of the night. Michael Mann manages to make the streets and skyscrapers of L.A. beautiful, both his direction and the grainy cinematography is worthy of an Oscar.

I thought Smith could have been replaced by any of a thousand actresses who looked decent crawling on their hands and knees.  I didn't seem to find any chemistry between Foxx and Cruise; they were directing their lines at a camera, not at each other.

Collateral is the perfect example of that type of movie. Both Jamie Fox and Tom Cruise share chemistry together so well you'd might think they have been doing dozens of movies together.

I haven't seen too many Cruise movies; just Top Gun and the Mission Impossble series, and I thought Jamie Fox couldn't get on the same level as he did in Ray, but this movie was awesome to watch and see what both men could do.

Jamie Fox stars as a cab driver named Max; a man who has the cleanest cab in Los Angeles. The first few minutes show how Fox can carry a regular cab scene with ease, and proves it when he shows his character's background who wants to open a limo driving business. [Don't worry, he actually is serious in the movie]

Max picks up a man named Vincent; played by Cruise, who gives him three hundred dollars up front to make five stops, ""To visit some friends"" It basically is a typical scene, till Max gets a rather nasty shock on his first stop [I won't give what it was away, but it is rather surprising]

To make a long story short, Cruise is a hit man on his way to five different people. His protrayal of Vincent is astonishingly cold, cool, and cruel. He will kill anyone who gets in his way and he informs Max that in order to save those people, ""Don't attract anyone who doesn't need to die's attention."" Seems easier said than done with what Max has to go through.

The camera angles are unique and styllized but the lighting is probably the only thing that I have a problem with. The whole plot takes place at night save a few minutes at the beginning and the end, showing when the plot begins and end.

And there is a scene near the end when vincent is chasing another victim where it is really hard to see. But besides those small minor details this is one pretty good movie with great camera angles.

To sum everything up I would definately reccomend this movie to those who want to see a styllized action flick with the most regular good vs. evil plot you might see.

His 80s' MTV style resonates even in this new millenium, and he manages to combine his trademark action elements with satisfying performances from his two leads.  First of all, though, I have to comment on Jamie Foxx's performance.  In his Oscar winning portrayal of Ray Charles, Foxx WAS Ray Charles, and one had a hard time believing he was acting.  In COLLATERAL, he is obviously acting; his nuances and mannerisms are trademark acting---good and solid, but his nomination for supporting actor leaves me wondering if this performance deserved that accolade, particularly in light of his shooin for Best Actor.  Certainly there were other actors out there (Liev Schrieber in Manchurian Candidate; Alfred Molina in Spiderman 2, for example) who should have had Foxx's spot in the supporting category.  Anyway, while Jamie does well in this role, I found myself more mesmerized with Tom Cruise.  As a legitimate superstar, Cruise has not taken the comfortable route by doing roles that appeal to his audience or do not challenge him.  In COLLATERAL, he takes the risk of being an extremely cold, unlikeable killer, with no redeeming qualities.  His hair sleek and silver, behind those Raybans, Cruise oozes menace and is one of his most interesting performances.  His physical dexterity, his cold steely glare intensify his performance, and it's to his credit that he shares so much of the movie with Foxx.  COLLATERAL ultimately is a twisted ""buddy movie,"" although the bonding is definitely not one of choice but of necessity.  I had a hard time believing a cabbie could change so quickly and outsmart a suave professional hit man, but cinematic rules dictated this heroic twist.  Jada Pinkett Smith is cool in a small but pivotal role; Mark Ruffalo, Peter Berg and Bruce McGill offer solid support in standard roles; and catch the cameos of Javier Bardem as Felix and Jason Stratharn as the man Cruise bumps into in the opening scene.

COLLATERAL works on many levels and I enjoyed it, although its rather despondent ending only reinforces Cruise's assertation that death is so common in LA that one might not even notice someone is dead.",1111104000,,2223,5.038251366120218

1529871,3,B00005JN2Z,"OK. so we've got a crime drama with some easy cliches: assasin with preternatural skills, ordinary guy (cabbie) with dreams of a better life; a brief meeting with casual love interest that turns out to be a key element to the plot and lastly of course a shortening list of victims that provides the engine for everything else.

Usually, when you watch a 'Firstname Lastname' film the whole point is the branding and the quality of the film is inversely proportional to the amount of desperate product placement and insecure-film-director ego identification. The need of one person to grab the credit for the work of several hundred talented individuals renders the whole thing worthless.

After a build-up like that you might be expecting the 'Collateral' falls into one of two extremes: awesome or pitiful. More interestingly, it's neither. For those of you that enjoy the 'Michael Mann' flavour, this is an opportunity to experience it in a new mix. No, it's not 'Miami Vice' with 20 years of additional designer stubble. Nor is it 'Heat' re-visited - although that would not necessarily have been a bad thing. One of the hallmarks of previous Mann productions is the creation of atmosphere using well matched musical accompaniment. The MTV generation  in particular will remember how Miami Vice epitomised the fashion for a storyline crafted seemingly specifically to match the mood music - almost as though the program was an extended rock video. Style over substance, the critics said, as though that was something bad and shameful. It was the 80's - need more be said?

So how does this all relate to 'Collateral'? Well, something happened with the editing and particularly them music production. No honey-smooth music; it's jarring, disjointed and - most significantly - noticeable. If you've noticed no mention of the trivial stuff such as visuals & cinematography or the acting ... something happened there too and it was much more interesting. It's refreshing seeing Tom Cruise step outside the pretty-nice-boy stereotype and if he'd been given more to work with he could have added some serious depth and grit to story.

Despite the soundtrack let-down; despite the 2-dimensional storyline, all is not lost. This is worthwhile entertainment that will grab you in the mood and take you with it. It's not going to set you ablaze so set your expectations appropriately and you'll enjoy it. The pace is unusual; uneven with a slow-fast-slow approach that creates a 'when will the punch land?' feeling. The violence is causal, matter of fact and by no means purely physical, which supports the overall atmosphere nicely. Whatever else you might fault with the production the visual treatment is terrific. There's a bleak, almost monochromatic edge to the colouration and a washed-out look that - once again - supports the atmosphere. Nihilism should be effortless to be convincing and 'Collateral' takes the less is more approach to good effect. There's enough blam-blam-crash-boom-bang to keep the action folks interested but 'Collateral' provides more than a succession of set pieces choreographed around then next explosion. The morality is ambiguous (thank goodness) and while there's some sense that a message should be taken from it all it's not rammed down your throat or telegraphed with endless 'major-plot-point; major-plot-point' signposts in the written-for-morons style.

For:

- stark, nihilistic, ambiguous and visually delicious.

Against:

- intrusive soundtrack and some crashingly illogical elements to the plot that - had they been left out - would have improved the overall effect of the movie tremendously.

The Near Miss:

- Can someone give Mr. Cruise a role where the character has some SERIOUS depth? Given how well he did with what he had here there's every indication he could join the ranks of the unforgettable nasties. Bring it on.

Recommended dining:

The Gaumont production 'La Femme Nikita' by Luc Besson provides a better example of mood and atmosphere or the so-called style over substance genre but with a surprising amount of substance and some pathos thrown in for good measure.",1110844800,4,4124,5.155688622754491

When you have something with this much potential then you need to make the movie as good as it can be.  Tom Cruise can do so much better acting and Jamie Foxx should re shoot every scene he was in.  Sorry if you think i'm being rude about the movie but seriously if you don't think the movie could have been so much better then your simply wrong.  It had so much more potential.  If you think the acting is good then you need to watch more movies cause it was terrible.

1529874,5,B00005JN2Z,"Cab driver Max (expertly played by Jamie Foxx) has been driving a cab for twelve years in Los Angeles, saving up for his dream of creating Island Limousine service.  He picks up a fare, Annie (Jada Pinkett-Smith) who is working late for the Prosecuting Attorney's office, preparing for a big trial the next day.  When Max gives Annie a speedy ride and pleasant conversation, Annie impulsively hands him her business card.

Max then picks up his next fare, a man named Vincent, who says he is only in town for the night on real estate business.  Vincent tells Max he needs to stop at five separate addresses for paper-signings, and winds out hiring Max's cab for the entire evening.  But Vincent is not into real estate, he is an assassin.  When his first hit of the evening inadvertently falls out of a fourth story window and onto Max's waiting cab, Vincent confesses to Max his real profession and orders him to drive him to the remaining four hits.

When Max asks Vincent what he is, Vincent replies, ""I'm Indifferent.""  Indifferent is a kind word for Vincent, he is a cold and ruthless sociopath, and expert in his field with a reputation for getting the job done.  Max is in over his head, stunned and shaken by the brutality that has entered his world, and desperate to find a way out of his situation without really knowing how to achieve such a feat against such a monster.

Get ready for some truly spectacular performances in this tension filled film.  Vincent is a new type of role for Cruise, that he carries out with amazing believability and casual elegance.  Jamie Foxx outperforms himself as Max, highlighting the superior actor under the hilarious comedian.  Jada Pinkett-Smith's role as Annie was fairly small, but stands out because of her excellent performance.

Can Max survive this hellish night?  Will Vincent achieve his merciless mission?  Is there any rhyme or reason to the selection of his victims?  How does Annie tie into Vincent's plans?  Just because the plot to this movie can be summed up in a couple of paragraphs does not mean that it is in any way boring or predictable.  `Collateral' is a tense thriller, with a tight script, great performances, rapid action bursts, and enough mental friction to keep you on the edge of your seat.

My hat is also off to Michael Mann for his superb directing skills, bringing back memories of Manhunter and Miami Vice as he expertly melds audio to visual, creating that sensory indulgence so unique to Mann's work.

This is an excellent movie whether you are in the mood for action, thrills, or tension.  Pick yourself up a copy, it's a buyer.  Enjoy!",1110758400,13,2623,4.716483516483517

Also, I was often -- too often, for my tastes -- left wondering why Foxx's character didn't just leave Cruise high and dry.

The only draw back is that the ending was predictable. I agree with the critics however, they don't make movies like this anymore.

Max (Jamie Foxx) is an LA cabdriver who dreams of owning a top-flight limo service.  He's just driving a cab til he can get the cash to do it right.  He drives at night:  the traffic's better, the tips are higher.

He picks up Vincent (Tom Cruise), who offers him double his shift pay if he'll break the rules and take him to visit five 'friends.'  First stop, when a body lands on the cab, he realizes his passenger is a sociopathic killer performing hits for a drug dealer.

This begins a surreal ride down the dark side of men's souls.  Max tries to get away, to stop what's happening, and is foiled at every point.

Until the last hit.  It's Max's previous fare, a lovely US Attorney.  Will he be able to save her?  Himself?

While the movie's premise was interesting and the action for the most part flowed well, there were long gaps of dialogue that took away from the action going on.  Further, one character who I had thought was going to be on Max's side got killed quickly.  What was the point of developing a character to that point and blowing him away?

why doesn't Cruise use a professional getaway driver?

Jamie Foxx is a lead in this movie and was actually nominated for Best Supporting Actor, not sure what is with that-is an actor not allowed to have two Best Actor nominations? Tom Cruise plays the best professional killer since the original Terminator, and there is even a homage to that movie in the club shoot-out. But Tom plays a human, not a machine, and truly deserves Best Actor for his performance. Allegedly Tom Cruise had never fired a real gun before training for this movie, and his pure-speed athleticism shows off with the two street thugs and the takedown in the club, where Cruise is so fast you can only fully understand the action when watching it in slow motion. In the Director's commentary, Michael Mann waxes eloquently on the digital camera photography and the artsy visual poetry is in the beautiful night scenes of Los Angeles. The cinematography is so beautiful that it can almost be enjoyed by itself with the sound off-- like the scene where the taxi stops while two coyotes cross the street. There's clever camera work like the ""falling camera"" shown just before the body hits the top of the taxi. But by turning off the sound you'd miss the clever dialog and soundtrack. The comeback to the accusatory ""You killed him!"" is one of the best movie lines of all time: ""No, I shot him. Bullets and the fall killed him."" The AudioSlave scoring from the coyote scene to the club shootout is in itself worth buying the CD, which also includes the Miles Davis jazz scene. But like an iceberg, this movie is really about what is going on underneath the psyche of the two men: the sociopath's cold heart is slowly being pierced while the procrastinator is finally forced to face his complete lack of leadership and initiative for action. Quite simply, this is not only the best movie of 2004 but one of the best movies of all time. Watch it once ""as is"", then watch it again to slo-mo Tom Cruise's action secenes, then watch it again with Michael Mann's commentary. Fantastic!",1109376000,3,2185,4.70757180156658
1529965,3,B00005JN2Z,"Based on the foundations of a classic 'good vs evil' action film, the script further delves into a number of various social\moral conflicts... hence the appropraitely named Collateral.

Most of the social concepts expressed by Cruise are cliche. It reminded me of Fight Club and its analysis of today's consumers, hypnotised by day time Tv, and depressed from unaccomplished dreams. Brad Pitt's tutorial on society's flaws are similarly questioned by Cruise, in an 'in your face, lawless, im too cool' fashion.

Also, the characters and plot interwind in a similar fashion to ""HEAT"", the director's previous work. Where good and evil come to understand each other, leaving a bitter sweet fight off at the end.

There is no doubt that Tom Cruise is a multidimensional actor, his role is convincing enough, once you get passed the grey hair and baby smooth skin. But I'd like to see him step outside the cool, charasmatic self and really give us next level performance. Funny, enough... I thought he was going to say ""ill be back"" at one stage on the train!

Overall, it was an okay movie, soon to be forgotten. Had they pondered more on the REAL complexities of good vs evil, this movie could have had more impact, instead it came off somewhat predicatable, mundane and already said.",1109203200,,1282,4.86697247706422
1529966,3,B00005JN2Z,"Jamie Foxx is in a mellow mood when Tom Cruise enters his taxicab at Los Angeles International Airport.  He has just performed a kind deed by providing an attractive young lawyer who has expressed frustration and doubt over the success of the federal case she is in Los Angeles to prosecute a free ride, for which she was grateful and provided him with her card.

It turns out that this federal prosecutor, played by Jada Pinkett Smith, will be linked to Cruise, but this is something Foxx finds out later.  Initially Cruise behaves in the manner of the successful executive type he appears to be, articulate, well dressed and bemoaning the fact that Los Angeles is so spread out with people failing to connect.  He makes a comment that one can die in a Metropolitan Transit Authority vehicle without the death being discovered for hours.

The death comment contains a connection to what Cruise's profession turns out to be, to the shock of easy going Foxx.  Cruise takes him on an all-night mission as he seeks to eliminate witnesses in a federal drug case in which a leading syndicate being operated by a Los Angeles racketeer stands to be shut down and its principals sent to prison.

Foxx attempts to shake loose of Cruise, but to no avail.  Cruise is so cold-blooded that he politely engages in a conversation about jazz and an appearance by the great Miles Davis with the operator of a club in the Leimert Park section of Los Angeles, who also plays the trumpet in the band.  After Cruise, Fox and the proprietor finish a relaxing drink the sociopathic hit man kills his cringing victim.

At one point, so suspicion will not be drawn toward Cruise, the hit man buys flowers for Foxx's sick mother and visits the hospital with him, where he is expected that evening.  Cruise makes a positive impression on Fox's mother through his engaging conversational manner.

It is Foxx who undergoes the character change during the nerve-wracking evening.  The formerly easygoing taxi driver toughens up significantly under the strain of the moment.  He has a strong hunch that he is intended to be Cruise's last victim.  This is borne out by police records, which reveal a recent incident in which an Oakland cab driver committed alleged ""suicide"" under strange circumstances while some unsolved killings were being committed in the same areas he had traversed before his demise.

Foxx ultimately concludes that Jada Pinkett Smith is prosecuting the case in which Cruise is seeking to eliminate all federal witnesses, and that the prosecutor is the final target on the narcotics syndicate's hit list.  The story spins into high gear, along with Foxx's strategy mode, as he seeks to save her from what will otherwise be a swift and ruthless death performed by a killing automaton with no apparent conscience.

Michael Mann directed the film from a screenplay written by Stuart Beattie.  The crafty cinematography by Dion Beebe and Paul Cameron accent the rapidly paced action with bull's-eye close-ups of people battling for survival in Los Angeles as a vicious drug mob does battle with federal and local authorities.",1109116800,2,3112,4.8933333333333335

It's more like a play than a standard movie in that it relies on strong characters and a simple chance series of events to make its point. To respond to earlier reviewers, I would argue that the plot is supposed to be implauseable in order to illustrate the idea that life is basically a set of events over which even the most prepared individuals have little control. Vincent epitomises the man in control. He is witty, dangerous, and utterly ruthless, a professional who is not the overly compentent standard sociopathic antagonist. In the rules of the game in Collateral, no matter how in control a character like Vincent is, he or she can still be taken out completely by chance. Of course, the shot that kills Vincent is blind luck.

There is no slow motion, self conscious cinematography or indulgent set pieces. Mann reigns in all of these tricks to keep the audience wrapped in the story. He continues with his recurrent themes of masculinity, professionalism and skill. Cruise and Foxx are exceptional here. Both deliver stand-out performances that are unique in their restraint. While both have ample opportunity to take their characters over the top, they don't. Instead they keep with the whole tone of the film and what you do get is much more rewarding and compelling. Like Mann's other films, he relies on the complexity of the characters to tell the story and not mindless action to fill in where the writing lacks. Mann is not afraid to show you the quiet contemplative moments because he knows they will sharply contrast with the action when it comes. There is nothing overtly exceptional about the story or even the writing, although both are good.

The director, Michael Mann, who has made a lot of excellent films like Manhunter, The Last Of The Mohicans, and the severely underrated Heat, has made one of his finest films ever.

Tom Cruise takes a different character path than usual as the bad guy in Collateral. The difference in this movie is that the bad guy is the most exciting character and the same guy that a lot of people would rather take sides with than the guy doing the honest and good thing. Tom Cruise does an above excellent acting job and is amazing to watch in this movie. His performance playing the bad guy in Collateral is so perfect, that it clearly stands out and gives him a chance to show an even larger amount of talent on a whole new level. It's actually so good that it is a good enough reason alone to see this film.

What makes this film better than a lot is the setting, tone, and look that it carries. Add that on top of Cruise's performance, and a better than usual job of acting by everyone in the film and you have a fantastic movie. In the dark night of the city, in a taxi cab and on the streets is where a lot of the movie takes place. The camera shots combined with the just the right cool music give the film a great amount of entertainment. You even have an rare, and unusual artistic touch in a part of the film where music from Audioslave is thrown into at just the right time. Then you see the camera follow a wolf wandering on the streets while Cruise and Foxx are in riding in the taxi cab.

Michael Mann takes the film in the right direction as usual. He then combines all the elements of a sure winner to come up with a brand new and enjoyable movie that you want to keep watching from the start to the very finish.

I now know what it is like, as the conclusion of this movie is quite akin to the director giving you a swirlie, only more humiliating.

The movie begins quite strong and quite well.  However, Michael Mann seems to enjoy advertising this as an intelligent film.  It is quite the opposite.  Towards the end of the movie there is a car accident.  This is when all logic goes out the window and the film bows down to the standards expected in a mindless action movie.  Horrific accidents without seatbelts yield little damage.  Professionals forget their incriminating laptops.  Professionals forget how to fire a gun.  The planets align and convenient coincidences are abound.

His steely-eyed professional contract killer is intense in every sense of the word and combine that with Jamie Foxx's terrific performance and you have the makings of a very good film.

Foxx plays Max, a nice guy cab driver who longs to have his own company but dreams about it more than actually doing anything.

As they are driving to the first location, Vincent makes an offer to Max he can't refuse--a ton of money if he will stay with him all-night as he makes 5 stops.  At first Max refuses (he could get fired), then changes his mind when he sees all the money but even then he is not totally comfortable with the idea.  But what Max doesn't know as he waits for Vincent at the first stop is that he is a contract killer hired by a drug lord to wipe out 5 people involved in an upcoming criminal trail against him.  All that changes when the first victim decides to jump out of the window onto the Max's taxi.  He's dead and Max starts feaking out.  Vincent regrets that Max had to find out what his job entails and now has to use a gun to get a reluctant Max to finish out the night.  The plot really picks up and never lets down after that great scene that sets up the rest of the movie.

Even though the basic plot is quite simplistic, there are other things going on in film, which, in my mind, elevate the film beyond the ordinary.  You find out the motivation behind Vincent and why he became the man he is and how this ties in with Max and how his life is not everything he thinks it is.  These are not the things of a by-the-book thriller and I found that aspect very interesting.  Vincent is not faceless madman with no humanity and Max is the not the totally great guy we are lead to believe in the beginning.

The first thing that struck me about the film was the unique look.  The cinematography, which is beautiful but very dark, adds greatly to the atmosphere--it's almost like another character in itself.  It really grabs you and pulls you into the story.  And Michael Mann's direction is sure and steady, keeping the action coming just when things appear to be slowing down.  Mann keeps proving himself as one of the best directors out there.

While Collateral proves itself as an above-average thriller, I was let down somewhat by the conventional ending.  Up to that point I felt the film was very unique, but the ending seemed to drawn from every other film of the genre. Still the film packs a great punch and features two great performances by the lead actors.",1107302400,,2978,4.3471971066907775
1530080,5,B00005JN2Z,"Michael Mann returns with this edgy masterwork of a movie about an ordinary taxi driver who gets caught into the world of a contract killer. It was like any other day and night for taxi driver Max, a superb Jamie Foxx (RAY, Held Up) Foxx picks up a grey haired mysterious man named Vincent, played with ferocious intensity by Tom Cruise (the upcoming War Of The Worlds, The Last Samurai), and after he picks him up things start to turn a little weird. Cruise is a hitman, who needs to kill 5 people he was hired to kill, so Cruise takes Foxx hostage. A nicely done character study with the two stars giving one of their best and believe me Foxx gives it all his best and when is Cruise ever dull as a villain?. Lots of action and excitment especially the scenes when Cruise shoots someone. Mark Ruffalo (In The Cut, 13 Going On 30) and Peter Berg (The Last Seduction, Aspen Extreme) play cops on the case. Ruffalo looks in good form and Berg looks tired. Also starring along for the ride is Jada Pinkett Smith (The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions) who is the 5th mark on Cruise's list, Bruce Mc Gill (Animal House, Rosewood), Debi Mazar (Space Truckers, Nowhere), Bodhi Pine Elfman (Mercury Rising, Enemy Of The State), Javier Bardem (The Dancer Upstairs) and a quick and unbilled cameo by Jason Statham (The Transporter, Cellular) at the beginning.

1530081,3,B00005JN2Z,"I was looking forward to seeing this movie after the hype, and found Cruise and Foxx to be both believable and talented in their  respective roles. A brief synopsis finds hard working and ""nice"" cab driver Max (Foxx) being unwittingly hired for the evening by ice cold mystery man Vincent (Cruise), and then dropped knee deep into an assassination spree, from which he is inextricably trapped. After a moderately slow start, the story builds nicely, with some intelligent plot work, good action sequences, and promises much in suspense, action, and the ability to hold your attention. Somewhere in the middle of the movie this gets lost, and even the most innatentive of viewers will see what's coming next from a mile away, and that's a real shame. Cruise and Foxx play off each other nicely, and there's a strange attraction to Cruises meticulous character, despite his sociopathic tendencies, and ice cold indifference to his victims. This is not a bad movie, but let's itself down with some avoidable mistakes, the main one being to revert to unlikely and implausible outcomes, just to reach the desired ending it self telegraphed earlier. Questions you may find yourself asking are: (DANGER SPOILER AHEAD)

1. The US Attorney general building is guarded by one solitary guard, and otherwise uninhabited?
2. Despite numerous security features in the building, Max is able to gain entry by simply walking through a side door?
3. Max can run, jump and arrive to save the day from half a mile away on a parking lot roof, before Vincent can go from the 14th to the 16th floor in the same building?
4. Three armed FBI units, a night club security team, LAPD, and a South American Druglords hit squad ALL in the same building with weapons drawn, ALL miss the target?

These are just a few discrepancies, in an otherwise tight and pacy thriller, but given that a multitude of better directions with the story could have been taken, the one chosen is a disappointment. Good movie, but NOT great. Enjoy",1107216000,3,1997,4.833333333333333

At first I was not sure about the silvery-gray hair, but boy oh boy, after watching Vincent ""on the job"", I was speechless. He plays one smooooooth contract killer. The interactions between Vin and Max the cab driver were very amusing and interesting, to say the least. The one point in the movie that I did not care for, and what kept it from 5 stars, was the ending which kind of left me hanging. It would have been much better if Vincent was just faking his death, perhaps to make it look as though he died to Max and Annie, and as the train pulled away from the couple, he lifts his head and grins or something to that effect. I was sad to see such a cool, suave character as Vincent biting it like he did. I mean, if he was supposed to be such a great man-for-hire, he should have been smart enough to be wearing some Kevlar under his crisp, tailored white shirt. Besides the slight disappointing ending, the movie still rocked and BRAVO TOM, if that is how you are going to age, you will still be HOT, HOT, HOT!!!",1107129600,2,1112,4.25

In the early going's of the movie, I grew leery as short MTV-like shots were fused together in the artsy style that leaves people saying, ""that sure is artsy,"" but mumbling under their breath, """"that sure is annoying.""  You know the spliced scenes in which no one or nothing truly comes into focus, voices talk but their separated bodies are off-camera somewhere.  Don't worry it's only the first minutes of introduction.  When you get down to the meat of the story ""collateral,"" is an engaging more unique than most ride.  Hold on to your seats.

The screenplay is a gem and the movies real strength is the sense of characterization you get from Jamie Foxx (playing cab driver Max) and Tom Cruise (ruthless and smooth hit man Vincent).  These are multi-layered people that you get to know on a more intimate basis and oddly enough especially in the case of Cruise care about.  The first part of the movie leaves you wondering what is it all going to be about until Vincent/Cruise truly checks in on the time clock and goes to work as the assassin he is.

There are moments that leave you laughing as the screenwriter shoots for irony and humor amidst the chaos and violence.  For that it reminded me a little of Pulp Fiction meets Die Hard.  Certainly not a brilliant movie or a best of category but well worth the watching and well worth the ride.  Cruise turns over a new leaf as evil killer and Jamie Foxx is just beginning to reveal his true talent.  Jada Pinkett-Smith, as prosecuting lawyer, is extremely easy on the eyes as always.

1530084,3,B00005JN2Z,"""Collateral"" delivers an interesting story with a tight pace, with some intense action sequences. It has good acting but does not delve too deep into its characters. And we wouldn't expect it too, because the whole story takes place in the course of one night. However, the cast of characters does make enough interesting revelations about themselves as the movie progresses to keep the plot moving along.

The best part I thought was the action. Tom Cruise plays ""Vincent"", a contract assassin who has the good looks of a GQ male model, the suave intellectual capacity of a business negotiator (at one point he dishes out an impromptu jazz trivia about where Miles Davis went to school to learn music), and the deft killing skills of a Navy Seal. There's a really cool scene where he takes out a battalion of bodyguards, cops and hitman in a dance club to finally execute his target. Jamie Foxx is convincing at playing a cabbie going about his daily doldrums, and is gradually pushed past the border of sanity by his involuntary role in a killing spree. He eventually reacts to it in the most heroic and unthinkable way. Foxx is good in this movie, but I'm not sure if he's Oscar-good.

This movie gave me a vibe like ""Training Day"", where characters are forced into a situation together, and people begin to reveal themselves bit by bit, as they are not really whom they seem to be. Eventually you know someone is going to be pushed to act totally beyond their normal behavior. The action is intense and tight here too, and definitely kept me at the edge of my seat.  3 & 1/2 Stars.",1107043200,,1585,4.593639575971731

And when you can tell that the movie wants you to be all like, NO WAY, and you're all like, SAW THAT COMING BEFORE I FINISHED MY HOT DOG, that is a bit of a cinematic failure.

Other than that it is a beautifully shot, well acted, concentrated study in tension.",1107043200,,577,4.818181818181818
1530086,5,B00005JN2Z,"I have been waiting for years to see Jamie Foxx take his rightful place in the pantheon of great American performers. He is a gifted actor, funny-man ( who can forget the I'm gonna rock your world lady from "" In Living Color "" ) and a very skilled musician. In "" On Any Given Sunday "" Foxx showed the movie viewing public that he could deliver a first rate, solid dramatic performance. I also have to admit to loving "" Booty Call "".

Cruise has always been a bit of a problem for me. I have disliked many of his films; particularly those projects where he has been a producer. I have found that there is a limit to how many shots of his hair, smile and steely gaze that I can stand. I include "" The Last Samurai "" as one of the worst big productions of all time. Still... he was wonderful in "" Rain Man "" and I thoroughly enjoyed his work in "" Minority Report "". However I have always believed that he has done his sincere best and is capable of great generosity with his fellow performers.

In "" Collateral "" Cruise intelligently takes a step back and lets Foxx shine. His performance as a professional killer is nuanced, and well developed. It would have been so easy to overplay his hand and start chewing scenery, but instead, he has shown an intense restraint that is very powerful, and creates the room that Foxx needs to leave his imprint on this film.

Foxx has established, once and for all, that he can hold the screen as a lead in a big time, big budget movie. He puts all of his wide range of dramatic and comedic to superb use. In numerous scenes he subtly uses his eyes alone to described shifts in his thinking and moods. He also has demonstrated that special ability to merge so thoroughly with his role. that it is easy to forget that it's Jamie Foxx on the screen.

The films plot move at a quick pace, but not so fast that there isn't time allowed for scenes and moods to be well established. The overall casting is perfect. The movie is beautifully filmed. The direction is first rate without being overbearing.

Jada Pinkett Smith also shines as a Federal prosecutor. I swear she grows lovelier with each passing year, and her screen presence and acting ability have followed a pace.

I would be remiss if I didn't mention the contribution to this film of Irma P. Hall. She came to acting late in life and brings her wisdom and life experience to every role she plays. She is an American treasure!

Cruise was good as the bad-ass hitman Vincent (not his best acting job though) and I absolutely loved Jamie Foxx's portrayal of the honest cabbie Max.  I think my favorite part of the movie was when Max slowed down to let the coyotes cross the street.  It cleverly showed just how different these two men are from each other.

The only problem that I had with the movie was that the last ""hit"" that Vincent needed to accomplish was pretty predictable, but other than that, it was an excellent movie.  I'm just disappointed that I didn't go see it when it was in theaters!",1106870400,,760,4.392857142857143

He plays a ruthless hit man out to eliminate 5-6 people who might potentially testify in an upcoming high-profile trial. He hops into a cab driven by Max, superbly played (I mean, SUPERBLY) by Jamie Foxx, and sets off on an all-night shooting spree.

Cruise doesn't change one whit throughout the film: he's a killing machine, period.

But Foxx. Omigod, Jamie Foxx begins as a taxi hack in a nowhere life and slowly becomes the reluctant hero of the film as he valiantly (and very improbably, but hey, this is an action movie, so sit back and just take it on faith) tries to save the life of Cruise's last and ultimate victim: the pretty DA in charge of the case.

It's exciting and edge-of-your seat tense throughout, and only 3 things really bothered me: 1) It's not believable that a car would overturn and crash to smithereens without either of the occupants getting more than a bruise, and Cruise's clothes don't even get mussed up, 2) It's not possible for women to run that desperately fast in 3-inch heels, and 3) The very last scene of them outside at dawn overlooking a freeway and parking lot was just...empty.

Great action, up until about the final third of the film...when it degenerates into nonsense.

Cruise is the infallible hitman, nailing his victims even in a crowded nightclub crawling with feds, cops and bodyguards.

Foxx is a sensitive, mild-mannered cabbie, definitely not an action hero. Hijacked by Cruise, he does a bunch of soul searching...until he gets fed up. This is where the film starts to lose it.

He deliberately flips the cab at high speed. The cab is totalled; neither Foxx nor Cruise so much as sprain an ankle.

An LAPD cop arriving at the scene finds a reason to regard Foxx a violent, dangerous criminal. Cabbie is on the ground, just about cuffed...and the next instant, it is the cop in the cuffs, and the apologetic cabbie has the gun.

Cabbie continues to go superhuman.

Does not seem to know how to use the gun, but that does not stop cabbie from zooming up the builing and getting the drop on infallible hitman. Not only does he get the drop--naturally the same instant hitman lines up on his last target, the damsel--but this cabbie that does not know how to use a gun drops the hitman with a single head shot from across the room.

Not the end, though; gets worse instead.

Hitman not dead. Chase ensues.

Final faceoff: the hitman that can precision nail running targets fifty yards away in the dark empties a full clip at the cabbie in a face-to-face standoff, with the cabbie and the damsel trapped in the narrow compartment at the end of a subway car. Shooting fish in a barrel, you say? The cabbie, and the damsel, walk away without a scratch!

1530161,4,B00005JN2Z,"""Collateral"" was a very pleasant surprise in the summer of 2004. Unlike most modern suspense films, which are really just thinly disguised horror movies, ""Collateral"" served up adult-sized portions of stomach-twisting suspense.

When hitman Vincent (Tom Cruise) steps into a yellow cab driven by Max (Jamie Foxx), it's the audience that gets taken for an often chilling ride. The film falters badly in the last third of its long running time, reverting to a standard Hollywood action formula. But until that happens, we're treated to a suspense film that is equally strong in atmosphere and in characterization. Much has been written about Jamie Foxx's ""star-making performance"" - but I would rate it as competent dramatic work, certainly a step up from his ""Booty Call"" days but nowhere near as memorable as his press agents suggest.  Tom Cruise delivers yet another overlooked virtuoso performance, on the other hand, playing a heartless killer. Cruise altered his appearance for the film, dying his hair white and wearing a powder grey suit; he looks like an angel of death, which is exactly the point. Both Foxx's and Cruise's characters have plausible, believable motivations, which adds to the fun. Foxx's Max is a mild-mannered hack whose big dreams are nothing more than a a delusion to make his life a little more bearable, and Cruise's Vincent is a reptilian sociopath, moral relativist and master manipulator. Foxx and Cruise have excellent chemistry together, and it's the interaction between those actors that help make ""Collateral"" a film that will be remembered years from now.

A two-disc set is excessive, however. I always welcome well-thought out extras, but there comes a point where too much information is shared. This is a flaw common to many of Cruise's feature films. I'm  getting tired of needless ""special"" editions with bonus discs. Wouldn't it be nicer (and cheaper?) if only the best extras were included on a stripped-down *single* disc? Extras are great if a film is technically groundbreaking in some way, or if a film is adapted from a difficult novel. Neither seems to be the case here. Padding a film like this is a lot like adding demos to a reissue of a CD; it's rarely enlightening and often tedious.

The hasty, Hollywood happy ending will ruin this film for many. I myself left the theater more than slightly disgusted at how Michael Mann's film backed away from its scariest implications, and retreated into action movie cliches. To me, the greatest pleasure of the film is watching the way the night-time cinematography reveals so much about two characters most of us would innocently pass by on the street. Adult pleasures like this are rare in summertime blockbusters, and should be applauded. Suspense and noir fans will definitely want to add this to their collections. Maybe next time we'll get a suspense film that doesn't cop-out near the end and give the kiddies a happy ending with a standard-issue action showdown.",1106611200,,2967,5.034623217922607

Yet, the real secret to a great film is that something essential about it must be anchored to an aspect of reality.

The very essential premise; i.e. a high-tech, highly paid hit man decides to kill a series of eye-witnesses by enlisted the aid of a cabbie, is so fundamentally stupid the remainder of the film spins away into nothing.

It really isn't necessary to enumerate the problems with this concept. Anyone that has ever flagged down a taxi, anytime or anywhere in the world, can immediately see the long list of obviouis problems.

Secondly, all the key witnesses to this hugely important trial are simply available for the killing. Not a one of them is under police protection. Christ, who needs an overpaid hitman for this job?

The plot is preposterous, but it is executed with 21st Century technical expertise.  Therefore, the viewer is so engaged with the visual extravaganza, he does not care that Tom Cruise essentially is impersonating Arnold's Terminator.  Cruise is a short man. The idea that he's a cool killer for some reason made me notice his eternal adolescent size.  In Easy Money he became the Cool Tom we see in Rain Man, Mission Impossible etc, but with gray hair, he resembles Tom with gray hair.  The kid doesn't have a lot of range, but Clark Gable didn't either.

The big surprise in Collateral is Jamie Foxx.  I have no idea how these comedians turned sitcom boobs can suddenly out act Tom Cruise.  Again, I'm not sure this is a big deal, but Jamie does steal the show.  He's a nice guy stuck in a bad job with a talkie mother. His dreams are not realized because of his own inertia. The Cruise killer prods Jamie to aggressive actions he would have never taken without the threat of death.  Therefore his personality morphs, which is more than I can say for Cruise's character.

LA at night is a strange alien city in Mann's vision.  Wandering the streets are the good and the bad in total isolation from each other.  Humans are but grains of sand on a universal beach according to Cruise.  Their elimination is meaningless.  From the rooftops LA is beautiful but meaningless.

When Vincent gets into Max's cab, neither of their lives will ever be the same.

Max's night starts off auspiciously enough, when he drives a pretty federal prosecutor named Annie to her office, and, since they hit it off,  she gives Max her card. Unfortunately for Max, Vincent, a former special forces guy turned contract killer, is his next fare.  Vincent, claiming that he is some sort of out-of-town real estate entrepreneur, hires Max to chauffer him around for the night. Vincent explains to Max that he needs to make five quick stops, and for this he will pay Vincent six hundred dollars. Of course, unbeknownst to Max, each of those quick stops is scheduled so that Vincent can dispatch someone to the great beyond.

By a twist of fate, the first stop goes wrong, when the contracted kill flies out the window and lands dead as a door nail on top of Max's taxi. The cat is out of the bag, as Max quickly discerns that Vincent is up to no good. Unfortunately, there is little Max can do about it other than to drive on with Vincent. Through their driving around together and their ensuing conversation, a moody character study of these two men develops. Of course, there is also a great deal of action whenever they are out of the cab.

While some of the moments in the film are seemingly incredible, if the viewer suspends disbelief and goes with the flow, all will be well.

The movie comes full circle, as the last hit of the night is no other than the luscious Annie, whom Max felt feelings of warmth toward earlier in the evening.

If you are part of the millions who always loved Cruise as the good guy, then you will have overwhelming feelings of confusion to see him portraying this murdering, non-feeling, hit man.  Foxx puts on an excellent performance opposite to Cruise, and is a natural in this serious role.",1105833600,13,1578,4.772058823529412
1530242,4,B00005JN2Z,"Sunday, January 16, 2005 / 4 of 5 / Mann's more personal offering.

I've enjoyed Michael Mann's work for a while going back to Miami Vice.  Manhunter was a nice step leading to his magnum opus, Heat.  Collateral, while lacking the epic scope of Heat provides a more personal one on one feel.  It's as if Mann has expanded the conversation held between DeNiro and Pacino in Heat at the diner and fleshed it out more fully in this film.  Jamie Foxx plays a cab driver who has the unfortunate pleasure of picking of Tom Cruise, a paid assassin doing the rounds for the evening.  Cruise almost makes it work for me, dressed in gray with prematurely grayed facial hair.  He's as gray as his soul.  However, too many times I almost cracked under disbelief thinking back to his numerous other `good guy' roles.  Still, Foxx made good progress throughout the movie on his journey of empowerment until the finale where of course, he must take on Cruise to save his sweetie.  A bit of a stretch to be sure, still the interplay between them and the dark streets and night of LaLa Land as a setting made the movie gripping, and ultimately memorable I think. Not Heat, but what could be.  Still, recommended.",1105833600,,1195,4.537383177570093
1530243,3,B00005JN2Z,"I recently played the game Hitman 2: Silent Assassin on my Gamecube. The title really says it all: SILENT Assassin. Yes? However I didn't particularly find it much fun with all that stealth and creeping around. I just went in guns blazing. I was crap. But I wasn't as bad as Vincent in this movie.

Tom Cruise plays Vincent (ooh ahh, Tom is playing a bad guy, hype, hype, hype) a thoroughly conspicuous looking character who is in LA for a spot of contract killing. He hires unhappy cabbie Max (Jamie Foxx) for the whole night. Five stops, five kills, yadda yadda yadda...you've seen the trailer.

This arrangement might have worked if Vincent were competent in the least. But he's just terrible. He leaves evidence everywhere, makes moronic mistakes, walks in front of every CCTV camera in LA and blabs far too much to Max, who any half-competent assassin would off at the end of the night anyway. Whatever the bad guys are paying him, the paycheck far exceeds the skill.

Michael Mann directs the film with amazing skill, brilliantly capturing the multiple looks and feelings of night-time LA. There are many scenes of tangible atmosphere in Collateral, so much so that the film is eerily calming. A very slickly crafted film, but not as memorable as previous films in Mann's career.

Cruise and Foxx have great chemistry together though it must be said that Foxx comes off as the better performer/character. Neither of them overact and keep their cool but there's a true realistic edge to his lonely cabbie than Cruise's idiot assassin who leaves incriminating exhibits A-Z all over LA.

The DVD is in gorgeous looking 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with colors so vivid and lifelike you'll forget your watching a movie and not real life. The Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is also stunning, fully complimenting the movie's dynamic sound design. Gunshots are very loud and pack a heavy punch, if you have a home theatre you'll love it. James Newton Howard's atmospheric score is also seamlessly woven into the film's sound design and it's surely Howard at the top of his game, miraculously blending his own score with non-original tracks.

1530247,4,B00005JN2Z,"""Collateral"" is, in it's own twisted way, a throwback to the crime/noir films of the 40's and 50's, even if modernized quite

a bit.  The feel Mann gives the viewer of LA is chaotic, slimy

and cheaply attractive all at once.  From the moment Vincent (hitman/sociopath) played by Tom Cruise jumps in for the ride,

we feel the city somehow come alive.

Never having been even a distant fan of Cruise, I can say he definitely comes into his own here.  Every second he's on screen you can feel the cold, animalistic cunning of a man who has

completely sacrificed his conscience (if he ever had one) to

the most evil kind of thrills imaginable--murder, aggression, death by numbers.  And, unfortunately for Maxx (Foxx's character), he is very good at the things he indulges in.

Contrary to what a lot of other reviewers have said, I really think Jamie Foxx was the weak link here.  He just can't act too well, and in some scenes he seems so ridiculously out of place that the film threatens to turn unintentionally comical.  The one unbelievable aspect is that Vincent could keep this goofball alive.  He's a walking target.

That notwithstanding, there are some unforgettable scenes, the foremost being ""The Jazzman"": Vincent decides that hey, since he's already offed a bunch of people earlier that day, he's ""ahead of schedule"" and Maxx should accompany him to hear some jazz.  We see the a somewhat human side of Vincent for a little while, enjoying the jazz, even buying the musician on stage a drink.  Together (along with Foxx sitting there, looking like a sore thumb) Vincent and the owner talk about Miles Davis, and how he played with him once.  At no point do we sense any real tension, just two men musing over a jazz musician they idolize.  Vincent than asks him if he ever ""looked him up"", or played with Davis as he was invited to. The owner replies no, and we see the existential logic flashing in Vincent's eyes, and it is developed later in the movie through Vincent's discussions with Maxx: if you don't go right after your dreams, you're a waste of flesh.  This is Vincent's poor rationale for killing; since people never really live anyway, they might as well die.

In a chilling moment, he mentions in a sideways way to the owner precisely why he is there and who sent him.  He toys with him, and then shoots him to death.

A few times Mann takes a break from the mayhem and goes on strange comcial notes: when Maxx's boss keeps pestering him

on his intercom about going to see his mother, Vincent reasons

that since anything unusual might blow his cover, they should go.

When Maxx refuses to buy her flowers at the hospital, Vincent turns and says: ""She carried you in her womb for nine months.""

The ending is an improbable turn of nail biting events which

end in Vincent's death.  It fits with his vicious cynicism and

general disregard for human life; he dies from a potshot taken by Maxx and lays dead on the LA subway.  This movie approaches greatness, but I think a Morgan Freeman or a more classical type actor would have been better than Jamie Foxx.  Worth owning, definitely.",1105574400,2,3112,4.612021857923497
1530307,5,B00005JN2Z,"Unlike most thrillers of our day, Collateral actually makes attempts at character development, and for the most part succeeds.

Jamie Fox plays the cabbie Max, a man who dreams of setting up his own limo business by saving up his taxi job money. Unfortunetely he's been at the business for some time, and so far no closer to his goal. But then Vincent (Tom Cruise) steps into his car. He sets the terms simply: five stops, six hundred dollars. Skeptical of his client, Max accepts and begins his trip into the night-world of hitmen and crime.

Taking place in a single LA night, Collateral packs a bunch into a two hour movie but does so without our knowledge. I was transfixed with the portrayals of the reluctant and tense Max and the icy-cool, homicidal Vincent.

While the beginning is mainly character and a few spaced out hits, the real acceleration into the climax begins as Vincent and Max escape into an LA nightclub with police hot on their tail. I recommend this to most who wish to watch a thriller with a fairly good character development stage (save for Vincent who is introduced quickly and simple in character).

My one comment is on the super adrenaline-powered rage Vincent succumbs to while his neck bleeds from a close-range pistol wound. I would think someone would fall down severely injured, if not on death's door, when you're neck is nearly blow out.",1105574400,2,1375,4.716666666666667
1530308,4,B00005JN2Z,"This recent film is a thriller.  But there is something slightly different about this one.  There's a good attempt at character development.

Jamie Fox is cast as an ordinary cabdriver.  But very quickly we see he is highly intelligent as he develops a relationship with Jada Pinkett Smith, a hard-working prosecutor who just happens to get in his cab.  It's obvious that she's a person who he'd like to see again and is delighted when she leaves him her card.

All seems very sweet and normal and then things suddenly change.  That's when Tom Cruise, cast as a sophisticated hit man, gets into the cab.  In a very short time the cabbie is exposed to murder and violence.  Tom Cruise keeps him a virtual prisoner.  He forces the cabdriver to drive him around when he commits murders.  But every time that Jamie Fox tries to flee, there is another twist to the story.

O.K. - the plot was silly.  I even dozed off a couple of times and it didn't matter that I missed a few details.  But I did keep watching to the inevitable conclusion.

This is not a great film but it is entertaining.  And I was impressed by the quality of Jamie Fox's performance.",1105488000,,1149,4.478260869565218
1530309,4,B00005JN2Z,"I hadn't heard much about this film, but still, I live in Cairo and am quite disconnected from the speed at which the Western world turns.

Many years back there were rumors, I believe, of Cruise playing the lead in the film version of Bret Easton Ellis's American Psycho. As it turned out, this film version has to be among the worst transitions ever made from book to screen. Though horribly disturbing, Ellis's portrayal of the serial killer, embedded within his time at the close of the 1980s and early 1990s, and particularly that time in New York City, for me, stands out as one of the most astonishing works of fiction written. I remember the monologues in the book about Whitney Houston and Phil Collins: how chilling they were set against the detailed, terrible descriptions of how the book's main character, Patrick Bateman, thought about and killed women. Collateral is, I think, in the same stream. Cruise is subtle and unrelenting. It is a great movie at the level of aesthetics (all of it taking place at night, bringing a feast of tones and images to the eyes), but also in terms of dialogue. Bateman is updated and taken to the West coast of America, and makes a living from killing. Mixed in is a powerful and curious combination of fatalism, Taoism even, and animal-like fierceness: one that draws the viewer very close to the lead character Vincent (played by Cruise), as well as Max (played brilliantly by Jamie Foxx) who ultimately resists and fights against Vincent's entire world. More than an action movie it opens all kinds of questions: questions concerning the will, concerning accidents, nerve under pressure, and the whole hidden underbelly of many of the cities in which we live.

Only wish the screenwriters had had the guts - like Ellis had the guts - to let the killer live in the end; for the force of the likes of Vincent, or Bateman, are constantly recurring. How many of us can really, truly say that good triumphs in this complex, unfathomable world?",1105488000,5,1988,4.742774566473988

- The bad guy gets shot in the face/neck then hops back up to resume the chase and perform such feats as leaping onto a moving train

- A cop has the good guy at gunpoint on his knees after discovering a body in the trunk, but the good buy casually flips him over and handcuffs the cop to a car easy as pie

- The good guy is able to see the bad guy in pursuit of his lady friend in an office building from the top of a parking garage, like watching an ant farm.

- Never fear, the good guy is miraculously able to cover the distance between the parking garage and the top of the office building JUST IN TIME (maybe he flew over)

- The bad guy, who NEVER hesitates at any other opint in the movie before killing someone, who easily and with blinding speed offed two guys who had him at gunpoint earlier in the film, takes a nice big dramatic pause when he has the good guy's girlfriend in his sights

- The bad guy, who had no trouble shooting several armed guards in a crowded nightclub while jumping and spinning around, fires an entire clip at the good guy from less than five feet away, missing with every shot

-  The good guy does the same, emptying his clip at VERY close range, but, luckily, only hits the bad guy in one special magical spot that allows him to make a dippy little speech before dying

- The girl, who hasn't been in the movie more than five minutes total, and that right at the opning credits, gets saved and falls in love with the hero just as the movie ends

And there's more.  The ending of this movie is formulaic, predictable, chiched, pat, tired, cheesy, and melodramatic.  Did other good stuff happen before this terrible ending?  Yes.  Does it matter?

1530313,5,B00005JN2Z,"Of late, every movie featuring Tom Cruise seems poorly constructed, his characters flat. And until Jamie Foxx's appearance in Collateral and Ray, he was known almost strictly as a comedian. But the premise of the movie intrigued me. One night. Five hits.

I expected a mindless action flick, a B movie with cool stunts and fight scenes. Instead, I was rewarded with a real piece of cinematic genius, a character study of intriguing and odd personalities. Max is a middle class cab driver. He's never been exposed to violence except for the little he's witnessed in his cab. He's stagnant, afraid to follow his dreams or change anything, afraid of failure. This is the night he will truly come alive.

Vincent, on the other hand, came from a broken family. His father was an alcoholic, his childhood probably one spent sheltered in foster homes. This would have been in the seventies, and he would have faced ridicule and degradation from peers. His life is about control. He has to manage his environment, even Max. He uses public transportation to keep his anonymity. What's one taxi in the middle of a giant city? Indistinguishable. He's skilled, highly trained, ex-Special Forces. This is the night the armor he's so carefully constructed will fall apart.

Every time I watch this movie, I discover something new. And every time I watch, it delights me how cleverly directed and seamless the plot truly is. Michael Mann succeeds in providing major details about his characters without intense exposition or flashbacks. Clues to his characters' backgrounds can be found in the little comments and gestures they make. And there are enough twists in this drama to keep you one your seat all night.",1105401600,7,1697,4.926573426573427
1530314,4,B00005JN2Z,"Tom Cruise is good in this movie and his role as a hit-man is a real departure - he is convincing as a ruthless killer.  Jamie Foxx is REAL good in this movie and in a few scenes he shows the acting ability that took him from playing comic roles to his show-stopper as Ray Charles.

I'm going to take as a given that you've heard a thumbnail of the plot: Foxx is a taxi driver with unrealized dreams, Cruise gets into the cab in the second scene and forces Foxx to drive him around to a series of hits during the night.

In one brilliant scene Foxx is forced to enter a den of hardened criminals and pretend to be ""Vincent"" the hit-man.  He is initially terrified - realistically - but as he realizes his very life depends on his ability to seem a callous assassin he undergoes a remarkable transformation in a few moments.  Foxx steals this scene: the best in the movie.

Until the final act there is not a flaw in the movie.  The first hour and fifteen minutes are good and compel you to the ending, but once you arrive there a few formulas kick in.  When Foxx is forced to accompany the killer I was reminded of Ethan Hawke as Denzel Washington's ""good cop"" partner in ""Training Day"".  In both of these films you suspect that the ethical character is going to be brought to a situation where not only his life is threatened, but also his ability to ""stand up"" and ""do the right thing.""  If Collateral had stuck to this track and realistically resolved the conflict I'd have awarded 5 stars.  I don't want to give away the ending, but Cruise's character survives an unseatbelted tumble in a flipping high-speed taxi crash, then a shot to the head, and keeps coming as if he were ""The Terminator"".  ""Fargo"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" made getting a shot to the head look like a painful, bloody thing.  ""Collateral"" makes it look like a good boxing punch.  Still, worth seeing, and Foxx probably deserves a ""Best Supporting Actor"" nomination for this film as well as ""Best Actor"" for ""Ray"".",1105401600,3,1982,4.424242424242424

The reasons behind this night of bloodshed are artfully revealed as the film proceeds, with clues neatly interspersed. Some of the action may seem random, but while the film contains the coincidences necessary to make it work, it plays out realistically...

Until the end. In the last 30 minutes or so, Tom Cruise's character undergoes a metamorphosis, transforming from the interesting sociopath he was at the start of the cab ride into an almost Terminator-like figure, hopping on the back of a train and reacting to gunshot wounds like you or I would react to a slap in the face.

Cruise does some of his finest work to date as a professional hitman who comes to the stark realization that he is somehow ""flawed"". He just simply nails the character, and brings to it a level of complexity quite often lacking in today's run-of-the-mill action crime dramas. Foxx was quite a surprise as the film's ""ordinary man caught up in extaordinary events"". I didn't know if he could pull it off, but I found myself quite pleased with his performance. These 2 lead characters play off each other quite well, and before the end, I kind-of hated that you knew the very fragile emotional bond they had forged during the night's events had to end. I very much liked that the whole movie spans just a few hours. It feels very ""immediate and now"", which just continually builds tension as the night presses on toward morning. Jada-Pinkett Smith doesn't do anything impressive, especially at the film's taut finish. She could have been a little more emotional about her situation. But that is one very minor flaw in what is great picture.

Michael Mann's movies simply blow me away. The guy has a natural instinct for pairing film with music. I was such a big fan of ""Miami Vice"" back in the day, and was always impressed with just how much the right music can bring to a scene. He is the absolute best at this in the business, and ""Collateral"" just showcases this at every turn. Before this movie, ""Heat"" was my favorite Michael Mann movie.

1530401,4,B00005JN2Z,"In an opening scene worthy of its own film, ""Collateral"" introduces its audience to a cab driver (Jamie Foxx) who would rather be doing anything else in the world than driving cabs.  Max sees driving a cab as beneath him; he dreams of a life of importance and seems to feel the need to apologize to his passengers for doing what he does to make a living.

Max then picks up Vincent (Tom Cruise) and promises to chauffeur the well-dressed businessman around for the remainder of the evening.  When Vincent begins killing people at each stop, the film becomes a struggle between the two individuals: a contract killer and the cabbie driving him to each murder.  In a narrative similar to what could be expected of a low budget play, much of the action takes place in the cab, as the two men bicker and debate while an unbelievable set of circumstances unfolds around them.

The film's strength is found in the performances of its two leads and in the unequaled craftsmanship of its director (Michael Mann).  Foxx and Cruise -each cast against type- give performances that rival anything in their pasts.  Foxx shows he can tone down his persona, nailing the cerebral Max, while Cruise continues his recent trend of trying to ""muddy up"" his good boy image.

Mann's direction is nothing short of spectacular.  Working with material that could have resulted in a corny, tired formula film in the hands of a lesser director, Mann is able to create a film that expands the potential for a crime drama.  He opens up the genre with ambiguous questions on the nature of killing and decorates the scenes with haunting, dark images.

""Collateral"" is not the best film of 2004.  In fact, the material leaves a lot to be desired.

Seems to me that is public domain, if they did not go inside.  And to beat all, it was filmed at night.  What was there to see to earn this type of money?  Perhaps the director or producer had been a student there at one time or another.  You can see why there were no 'extras' and Tom had only one outfit. I did like Tom Cruise's white hair and spiffy gray suit. Nice for a change.

1530481,2,B00005JN2Z,"I'm not sure why Jaime Foxx is receiving such great accolades for Collateral, when in fact Tom Cruise is the scene stealer in this film. Cruise plays his most vicious character to date as a hitman with absolutely no conscience. The best scene of Collateral has to be when Vincent's briefcase is jacked from Max's (Foxx) cab by a couple of street punks. Vincent just strolls out in time to see the kids walking off with his possession. He approaches them and has a gun put to his head, but in a split second the two young men are dead and Vincent has his briefcase back. Michael Mann tries way too hard to delve deep into character development for Max and Vincent when in fact all the audience really wants is to get an inside glimpse of Vincent's facinating lifestyle. The movie is about a half hour too long and the ending seems as if it was rewritten at least a half dozen times. The ultimate payoff in this film is certainly not worth the ride.

for Best Supporting Actor for this film. But it doesn't matter,

'cause he's probably gonna win Best Actor for ""Ray"". Tom Cruise gives an Oscar worthy performance but I don't think Cruise is gonna score gold this year. I just have one problem with this film. The cinematography. It's filmed a little too much like,

I-was-there-and-got-it-all-on-tape kind of stuff. It looks to be filmed with nothing but a handheld. But,the story (by ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" writer Stuart Beattie) is spectacular and it's masterfully directed by Michael Mann. The film is about Max (Foxx). Max is driving a cab in an attempt to get enough money to

open his own limo business (a dream that's going nowhere). He says it's part time, but he's been driving for 12 years. One day his luck changes when he meets a woman (Jada Pinkett Smith) and might score a date. But with good luck, comes bad luck and Max meets Vincent (Cruise). Vincent offers Max six hundred dollars to take him to six stops on ""real estate business"". Problem is at the first stop a body falls on top of Max's cab and Max discovers Vincent is a hit man. The two develop a sort of weird friendship along the way,but the movie is totally suspenceful and just plain terrific. Tom Cruise with his gunmetal gray hair kind of makes the movie what it is. It's his best performance since ""Eyes Wide Shut"". Jamie Foxx (who started off as a comedian, then came into drama with Oliver Stone's crappy

The acting in this movie is exceptionally good and the Director Micael Mann does a swell job.  Overall Collateral is a movie you should watch if you like action mixed with acting that makes up for the mediocer plot of A hitman riding around LA in a Taxi.  To me this movie was a typical ""good movie"".

What makes up for some slow parts in the script, is the way-cool gun shooting scene in a night club and basically all the stops in which Vincent (Tom Cruise) stops in his attempts to carry out his lifestyle of killing.

Collateral is a descent movie that is worth watching.",1104710400,2,667,4.525
1530555,3,B00005JN2Z,"Why is this different?

Because I'm the only one here who's citing the source of this film.  Collateral is NOT an original idea.  It has its roots in a 1993 Japanese film directed by Masato Harada called Kamikaze Taxi in which a young Yakuza hires a taxi driver to take him around to the homes or hangouts of the men responsible for his girlfriend's death and the deaths of several of his friends.  These include his Yakuza boss, Yakuza soldiers, and a corrupt, sleazy senator.

While not the same story--Collateral takes off from the above to involve Jamie Foxx as the driver in a ruthless series of hits by anti-hero Tom Cruise, totally unrelated to revenge--the basic concept is the same.  In fact, Collateral is much less credible than Kamikaze Taxi.  Why wouldn't the hitman kill the taxi driver once the latter recognizes what the hitman is and what he's doing?  Just to avoid having to take another cab?  Not likely.  This glaring point of non-credibility weakens the story considerably, even though Cruise is really good and believable as a hitman (truly vicious), and Foxx is equally as good in his role.

It's interesting that the screenwriter chose not to do an American version of Kamikaze Taxi directly, but instead twist the plot somewhat to try to make it look original and, possibly, more ""American"".  Nevertheless this is too close for comfort to Harada's film which is now available on DVD and is an interesting piece of work.

The three stars here are for the performances by both Cruise and Foxx which are admittedly quite good.",1104710400,3,1548,4.774436090225564
1530556,3,B00005JN2Z,"To be frank, I'm not certain if I cared for this movie as much as I had originally thought after walking out of the theatre. The more thought I give to "" Collateral "" the less seems to make sense and the less I seem to be able to give it my complete approval.

Since everyone seems well aware of the story-line I'll dispense with that but for this film to work you truly do need to put a certain amount of reality on hold. I'm sorry but for starters how am I to believe that Vincent ( Tom Cruise sporting a truly terrible blonde mane. He should of been looking to assasinate whoever gave him that cut and dye! ) playing a notorious, but well-dressed, hit-man is going to parade around Los Angelos in a cab, popping off victims while the cabbie, I suppose, is to sit in his taxi counting up the money offered by our somewhat misguided killer? Vincent may be the worlds most trusting killer in the history of film noir. Right away the premise is beyond believable! But if one is able to neglect that glaring nonsense the movie does have its good points. But there are other problems that arise...

The action is pretty much non-stop and the interaction between Cruise and Jamie Foxx is plausible if not exactly revelatory. Tom's character, when not killing his victims, offers Jamie career advice during the interim. A strange mix of Dr. Phil's 'tough love' meeting 'Killers Row.' Sadly though while this is done with the single intention of getting the audience to actually care for Vincent it simply never really comes together. While Mr. Cruise, in his own way, is a fine actor I never truly believed for a moment in his ability to come across as a hardened murderer. Perhaps he was supposeed the play the 'killer with a heart of gold' but I didn't sense that either.  The whole thing does come across as Tom Crise in an expensive suit, sporting a week old beard and trying to look cool/urban though married with a certain odd neuroticism. Tom is a fine actor but in this role he seems somewhat miscast. Though Jamie Foxx as the cabbie with motivational issues does an exceedingly wonderful job and he virtually saves the film himself. Though to be honest, while previous reviewers have found their dialogue interesting I found the majority to be contrived and devoid and any true substance. I mean, we have Vincent offering Foxx's character advice on affairs of the heart!!?? Plus, in one silly scene he forces the cabbie to take him to his mothers hospital room so the cabbies nightly routine does not appear askew. I'm assuming this was included to give Vincent's character a rather 'warm and fuzzy' appeal that offers the film its one tender moment. Truly bizaare and almost desperate in its attempt to come across as dark and intriguing. One could almost sense director Michael Mann trying to throw in anything that might give this movie another added depth but it merely came across as contrived. The only saving grace was Mr. Manns inate ability to use Los Angelos as a third character, giving the film a nice, urban detached look that worked extremely well. Obviously M. Mann could be accused of throwing in everything,including the kitchen sink, to make this work and sadly it comes across as slightly pieced together.

Overall, while a nice enough movie I found far too many scenes somewhat unreal and lacking any real substance. It does flow well and it will keep you in your seat ( though hardly on the edge! ) but the further the movie went into its inevitable conclusion the more its seemed to slip into an almost weird urban fairy tale. It all became oddly episodic but never completely mesmorizing. Nevertheless, an enjoyable movie for guys who love lots of "" bang, bang "" but little interesting dialogue to get in the way.

1530558,1,B00005JN2Z,"Let me first say that I LOVED the first 90% or so.  I was riveted.  ""This action movie,"" I thought, ""is different, it's not following the formula for once!""  The acting was terrific, and so was the dialogue.  The plucky young cop, who you'd normally expect to help save the day at the end, gets abruptly killed about three fourths of the way in.

All of my enthusiasm and interest leading up to the end only made me MORE furious when the end turned out to be nothing more than a series of cheats, cop-outs, cliches, and plot loopholes, all adding up to make it as predictable and formulaic an ending as any cheesy action flick I've ever seen.  For example:

- The Bad Guy, able to shoot and fight his way out of impossible odds and kill in the blink of an eye when up against side characters, finds his skills severely diminished when he begins battling main characters late in the movie.  WHOOPS!

- The Good Guy shoots the Bad Guy, but of course, just like the formula dictates, it is only a flesh wound, and the Bad Guy rises to continue chasing the Good Guy, only now he's EXTRA MAD!  Ooo!

- The place where the Bad Guy has been SHOT IN THE KNECK stops bleeding within 20 seconds.  I am not exaggerating; as soon as he gts up, the next time we see him his kneck has some DRY blood on it and has not even bled on to his suit collar.

- After being mortally wounded, the Bad Guy has time for one last dramatic little speech.

- The Good Guy and the Bad Guy stand face-to-face about three feet apart and fire about 7 rounds each DIRECTLY AT EACH OTHER, until they both run out of bullets.  Then there's a dramatic pause, after which, OF COURSE, the Bad Guy wilts, having been shot, and the Good Guy looks on, miraculously unscathed (even though the Bad Guy's marksmanship has been, up to this point, superb).  True, the Bad Guy can hit moving targets from up to 30 feet away while doing a diving summersault in a crowded room earlier in the movie, but never mind I guess.  WHOOPS!  I mean, YAWN!

- The Good Guy walks away with the Damsel in Distress at the end, giving her his coat to wear and throwing a protective arm around her shoulder.  This, despite MYRIAD loose ends.  I guess this cheesy, pat scene is supposed to be a panacea, like ""Love Conquers All"" or something (even though these two characters have only met once before in the movie during a brief cab ride).

I could go on, but you get the idea.  See, I wouldn't mind these things in, say, Die Hard or Lethal Weapon.  You EXPECT those movies to be this kind of [...], and you enjoy them for what they are: mindless tripe with loud booms and gunz blazin.  THIS movie builds up so much interest, banks so much quality dialogue and genuine charachter development, it was a crime to see it squandered on an ending like this.  It was like the writers just stopped trying right at the end.  I was furious, and I sincerely wish I had not wasted my time with this movie.  If you rent it, which I reccommend you don't, do yourself a favor and stop watching IMMEDIATELY after the Good Guy flips the cab.

Jamie Foxx plays cabbie Max, a man with big dreams and a lot of common sense.  He finds himself in quite a bind after Tom Cruise's character, hitman Vincent, forces him to drive him to all of his scheduled assassinations.

Yes, some of this movie is predictable, but a there are also a few twist and turns that make the movie more enjoyable.  The actual activities and routes the charaters perform are believable, parts of the dialogue are NOT.  When Jamie Foxx calls to warn a woman that Vincent is on the way to kill her, the woman keeps saying, ""I don't understand.  What are you saying."" That was totally unbelievable.  I think there should have been a little more thought put into the dialogue of this film.  Too much hype and spice was thrown into the mix.  The action was good enough that Mann could have relied on more believable dialogue to keep the film flow seem more even.

All and all, this is a good movie.  I think most people will enjoy the entertainmnet.  Warning to those with children (and us adults that are sick of hearing the F-word all the time), there is a lot of cussing in this movie...ummm...and...violence. :-)

I appreciate the director also trying to really get into the characters portrayed here vs. having carboard-cut-outs that run around playing role with no depth.

This is probably where Max makes the biggest mistake -- he accepts by waiting.  It is a contractual agreement that Max will likely regret.

The setting of the movie is mostly in Downtown Los Angeles.  The scenes are done remarkably well.  It is a violent movie.  Nothing is left to the imagination.

The creators of the movie did a remarkably good job in character development in the beginning of the movie.  Although some might think it's dull, it really shapes the character of who the individuals are in the movie, including the prosecutor, Max, and Vincent.

1530664,5,B00005JN2Z,"""Collateral"" is one of the best films of 2004, a visually sumptuous masterpiece that may eclipse ""Heat"" as the definitive modern Los Angeles crime picture. Michael Mann directed both, and, using digital technology here, photographs the city so initimately LA seems almost foreign: Gone is the balmy, commercial gleam of Beemers and cell phones; in its wake, a spare, working metropolis pocked with desert wilderness. It recalls the Raymond Chandler days: Men live and work here. The white noise has been dialed all the way down. The plot to ""Collateral,"" from Stuart Beattie's screenplay, is mere potboiler, but Mann's style so informs the story that it acheives a kind of elegance, a fuzzy sheen not unlike the halos surrounding the street lights in the movie.

The same can be said of the comfortable subtle performances from two noted extroverts, Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. Cruise is Vincent, nihilist first, hitman second, more brutally than silently efficient, who hires cab driver Max (Foxx) to usher him around to six targets throughout the city. The first hit is a failure: Vincent's target falls out the window and onto Max's cab.

""Plan B,"" Vincent says.

A conflict emerges: The Foxx character is smart, angry and moral enough to size up his captor's plan - Max might as well be on the ferry going across the river. It becomes a question of impulse, and the cautious, plodding Max is not initially up to it until Vincent rigs a daunting, if unlikely, scenario inside a night club. Other preordained complications - foreseen, frankly, as these movies exist to have curveballs - emerge; Vincent is fond of jazz, and likens the rest of the evening to improvisation, ""between the notes.""

Visually the movie is precisely imperfectly so, as Mann mixes his patented jam-in-your-face close-up with overhead shots, staged medium compositions, documentary snippets, as when a coyote gallops across the street in the dead of night. The epic cool of ""Heat"" is gone, replaced by blue-collar sweat and that dense grain of Mann's ""Ali"" - it seemed cinematically ambivalent at the time, but it's making more sense now.

The look of ""Collateral"" is disturbing and beautiful, distancing and timeless. The apex comes when Cruise is framed by a subway window, outside which the sun has begun to rise, the curved palms beginning to get distinguish themselves against the sky. It is a Mann Moment, one that escaped him in ""Ali,"" and was simply too contrived and arch in ""Heat"" when Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro clutched hands.  Here it is exotic and lush, both contained within the car and infinite out the window, with a view stretching for miles toward the desert or ocean. It is a shot the city, and cinema, deserves.",1104105600,7,2709,4.9298245614035086
1530665,5,B00005JN2Z,"Director Michael Mann does what he does best with ""Collateral"", a well-written (by Stuart Beattie), entertaining thriller that knows just when to be intense and when to be mellow. ""Collateral"" takes place overnight in Los Angeles. Max (Jamie Foxx), a veteran cab driver who dreams of owning a limousine service, picks up Vincent (Tom Cruise), a slick, talkative fare who offers him $600 for a night's work: 5 stops and get him to the airport by 6 a.m. Sounds good, but when a bloody corpse lands on his windshield, Max comes to the abrupt realization that Vincent is an assassin. He becomes an unwilling accomplice in a murder spree, as Vincent attempts to fulfill his professional obligations and Max tries to walk the line between thwarting a killer and saving himself.

Much of ""Collateral"" is distinctly mellow in tone. Low-key conversations play out over the classical music in Max's cab. This makes the bursts of action more intense and surprising. No one could call ""Collateral"" realistic, but the attention to detail in the characters' speech makes it seem so. I have to admire Tom Cruise for embracing villain roles at this point in his career, where other stars have shunned them or insisted on watered-down scripts. Cruise has nothing to lose by playing unlikable characters, and they will among his most memorable work. Vincent's self-possession lends him great presence and charm, while his moral bankruptcy makes him revolting. Cruise is perfect for the role. Jamie Foxx plays the film's ""everyman"" who rises to the occasion when circumstances demand it. He's stressed, put-upon, and trapped, and he acts it. Jada Pinkett Smith does a nice job in a supporting role as a prosecutor, Annie, who takes a ride in Max's cab, as does Mark Ruffalo as Police Detective Fanning, who suspects trouble in Max's cab after one of his informants is murdered. Great cast, great dialogue, and perfect pacing make ""Collateral"" an engaging, character-driven thriller that almost everyone will enjoy.",1104019200,86,1995,5.0638297872340425
1530666,5,B00005JN2Z,"Collateral stars Jamie Foxx as the meek dreamer cabby Max. Tom Cruise stars as a hitman named Victor. When Max gives a free cab ride to a beautiful woman, his next rider turns out to be Victor, the lovable but-oh-so-evil killer for hire. Can Max grow a spine and escape Victor or will he become just another of Victor's victims? I really enjoyed Collateral, despite some initial misgivings after seeing the trailer. Max was an endearing character and a loveable loser. Victor was funny, and despite being a killer had some spot-on advice for Victor. I particularly liked the scene where Max was forced to impersonate Victor at the club.

There were a few minor peeves (such as the rather stupid chase scene at the end), in which the two lead characters failed to elude Victor (Yeah right), and a few scenes just showing them in the cab driving around town doing nothing which could've been edited out.

Overall, a fast fun film sure to please action fans!",1104019200,5,955,4.678571428571429
1530667,5,B00005JN2Z,"Tom Cruise never ceases to amaze. Just when you thought he found his niche he breaks away from it to do something really different.

Jamie Foxx was the real treat in this movie however. His portrayal of the taxi driver Max, dreamer and frustrated limo service operator in my opinion rockets him to the big time in character acting.

I actually have always enjoyed Micheal Mann's movies. Part music video and part intense action drama noone blends the two concepts together like Mann does. It's not necessary to like the blend but you have to admit that he does it well.

No sense rehashing the premise here but briefly Foxx is a taxi driver who picks up a fare ( Cruise ) and gets hired for the whole night to bring ""Vincent"" to visit a host of ""friends"" (well they're somebody's friends) throught the night and deliver him to the airport in the morning.

The first ""visit"" results in a little unexpected turn and Foxx is now in for the game whether he likes it or not.

There are parts that are intense and some things that are comic along with quite a few memorable lines like my favorite:

  Max: Hey! Hey, he fell on the cab! I think he's dead.
  Vincent: Good guess.
  Max: You... you killed him?
  Vincent: No, I shot him. The bullets and the fall killed him.

Anyway - I didn't buy this DVD. I don't see myself watching it over and over again but for a one time view I recommend this as a ""don't miss"".

Casting was terrific, Cruise was great but Foxx was better.
I was thrilled to see Irma Hall again (LadyKillers) and Jada Pinkett Smith was as always a welcome addition to the cast of any movie I am watching.

Good watch for a Saturday night. Well worth the 2 hours invested.

I guess this movie isn't for everyone, but if you liked Phone Booth you should like this. I didn't like Phone Booth but liked this.",1104019200,3,1818,4.3601190476190474
1530668,4,B00005JN2Z,"This was a very entertaining thriller.  Tom Cruise is a very fine villain and Jamie Foxx does an even better job as the fish out of water hero.  I don't want to say anything about the plot because it is the movement of that plot from what you are set up to expect to what happens that is the real payoff of the movie.  Jada Pinkett Smith plays the super competent (but anxiety filled) and beautiful prosecuting attorney with a good balance of strength and vulnerability.

I have to say that Mark Ruffalo and Peter Berg playing the undercover cops and Bruce McGill as the fed do very good work in unfolding the story in a certain direction.  Javier Bardem has a brief but memorable appearance as the drug king pin Felix.  Well, he is more of a mid-level manager of a drug dealing operation, but you will understand all this after you have seen the flick.

Cruise's character, Vincent, is usually a pretty cold - force of nature kind of murderer, but he has his own flaws and manages his progress through the plot without perfection.  Foxx's embodiment of Max is actually quite good.  Max has to undergo not only a transformation, but some self-realization that he has been avoiding for quite awhile.

I don't want to say anything about the final act, but I didn't find it as fresh as the middle acts, although it still works in its own way.

The extras on the second disk are pretty good and provide good background on the movie including how it was made.",1103932800,,1454,4.46969696969697
1530669,4,B00005JN2Z,"COLLATERAL, director Michael Mann's most recent film, is not only a nail-bitingly tense thriller (especially in its final half hour), but also a fascinating study of two characters, contract killer Vincent (Tom Cruise) and cabbie Max (Jamie Foxx), who, as screenwriter Stuart Beattie subtly and slyly reveals, had grander ambitions as younger men but have had to settle for something much less. Max, especially, has dreams of eventually owning his own limo service and striking it rich---but he's been dreaming about that for the twelve years he's been driving a cab.

I enjoyed this film a lot, but I will concede that I probably liked it more for its ambition than for its execution. To be hypercritical, for example, I suppose that in the end this human angle to the characters---the conversations Vincent and Max have while the latter is taken hostage by the former take on existentialist, ""what-is-our-purpose-in-life"" tones, though never as pretentious or preachy as it may sound---doesn't really lead anywhere, that they're all just little details to add spice to what is otherwise a rather standard thriller. The moody final shots of the film, for me, don't sum up any of the character themes Mann throws into the picture, as fraught with meaning as they outwardly seem.

Still, better to have involving human characters that spout convincing dialogue rather than just another high-tech thriller with loud shootouts and bombastic chase scenes to cover for a neglect for the human factor. And it helps that the performances are, for the most part, quite effective. In the case of Jamie Foxx, it is much more than that. His touching performance as Max truly brings sympathy to his character, who is not only Vincent's victim but perhaps a victim of his own delusions of grandeur. (In a few small ways, I think Foxx's quiet, unassuming turn here might be slightly more memorable than his more outwardly impressive portrayal of Ray Charles in the recent RAY.) As for Tom Cruise, I was generally able to accept him as the steely bad guy Vincent, but a better actor might have brought more convincing menace and gravitas to the role. Still, Cruise pulls off this casting-against-type reasonably well...and besides, now that I think about it, perhaps COLLATERAL is more about Max than it is about Vincent. Who doesn't dream big against all reason once in a while? Max is who we relate to in this film, who we root for, who really involves us emotionally.

In short, COLLATERAL may not be a truly great film, but it is a good one that works as an effective suspense thriller and as a character study. These two sides may not totally mesh together to produce a convincing whole vision, but I would take this kind of ambitious, intelligent movie over a soulless Hollywood thriller ""product"" any day.

1530670,3,B00005JN2Z,I'll make this brief. Plot is promising but film had a bit of dragging moments enough to put you to sleep just to be waken up again at the end because it suddenly becomes a fast paced thriller. Bonus disc has not much to offer either that would be interesting enough to see. This is just my opinion thou and I don't represent the view of the general public.,1103846400,,357,4.188405797101449
1530737,4,B00005JN2Z,"Both Cruise and Foxx shine in their respective roles as the cold, cultured, refined hitman and the workaday cabbie holding out for the American dream who is taken hostage one evening.  Beyond that, I found little in this film that stands outside the average action film in terms of execution or how the story is told.  While the premise is unique, here is why I didn't like the film:
1. Beyond the premise, I could guess what was going to happen next, including who some of the victims were going to be.
2. It was never clearly explained WHY Cruise wanted to keep Foxx around, rather than cutting him loose and doing the job alone, especially once things didn't go as planned.
3. There were too many coincidences, making too many things convenient.

It is not as if I expected a masterpiece, but I was surprised, based upon the amount of acclaim that was given this film, to find so many problems with the script.  One thing I did like about the film, however, were the messages it tried to send (mainly through Cruise's character) about human interaction and social responsibility in an increasingly urban, populous environment.  The film should have developed this idea more and spent less time in cliches.",1103846400,,1208,4.706161137440758
1530738,4,B00005JN2Z,"The level of critical acclaim accorded this movie is, after watching it myself, a real surprise. Certainly, it is a good movie, but that it should be given a place on the AFI's Top 10 Films of the year list seems a little ridiculous.

The movie has three very good things going for it - Cruise, Foxx and Michael Mann. Cruise's performance is excellent. In my opinion, his best in recent memory. The reason for this is, largely, that it doesn't seem as if he's playing ""Actor Tom Cruise"". In many of his recent films, his performances have been remarkably similar and it feels as if he's only been going through the motions. In Collateral, he brings something different to the role and it's a refreshing change. Foxx, as ordinary cabbie Max who carts around Cruise's hitman Vincent, is also excellent. What really elevates this film above the level of your typical action-thriller, however, is the direction of Michael Mann. The film is kept remarkably taut as soon as Vincent gets into Max's cab, but Mann does this without sacrificing top-notch visuals. What keeps this film from being truly excellent is Stuart Beattie's run of the mill screenplay. The film is filled with traditional suspense movie sequences (ie. shootout set to electronica in a crowded dance club) and the ending is telegraphed early on (making Mann's feat of keeping everything suspenseful all the more awe-inspiring).

Recommended. Great acting and direction, but only an average script.",1103760000,2,1461,4.959183673469388
1530739,3,B00005JN2Z,"Tom Cruise was excellent in this film, perhaps the best performance I have ever seen him have. I am usually not a big fan of Tom Cruise movies, although I don't have anything against him as an actor. If there was a weak link to this picture it would be Jamie Foxx's character. His character seems way to calm under such stressful situations. It was definitely the decision of the director to have the character played out in this manner. In some ways I respect the decision to have the character act somewhat level headed but it does remove the tension from some scenes that could have used it.

The story itself is simple and I don't consider myself great at predicting the endings of movies (the Sixth Sense had me totally fooled) but I could tell what would happen in this film. Never the less it is worth seeing for action suspense fans. Not as fun and a little more gritty than the Bourne Identity series.",1103760000,,910,4.449101796407185
1530740,3,B00005JN2Z,"Let me say at the outset that if you like thrillers and don't mind formulaic movies then you'll like this. That said Hitchcock this ain't. Anyone familiar with the genre will have figured out the ending ten minutes in, right down to the telegraphed attempt at irony engendered by Vincents' complaint on the impersonal nature of LA. As to the boy meets girl, boy saves girl traditional thriller ending it's been done so many times that it takes a great plot to pull it off, and this movie doesn't have such a plot.

 The cinematography is excellent and the soundtrack drives the action well. Cruise and Foxx are adept and earnest in their roles, and the dialogue works well enough, though it does break down at a few points; most notably during Foxxs' meeting with the ""Vincents"" drug lord employer. Cruise has thankfully learned the art of self control in acting and doesn't overplay his role as the assasin.

 The major problems have been pointed out by most impartial reviewers, ie those not silly enough to propose this predicatable movie is worthy of Oscar consideration. The biggest problem is of course the unbelivability of the plot and the absurdity of the ending. (Deadly killer who when confronted with the ""hero"" suddenly loses the ability to hit the side of a barn.)

 All in all a common thriller with solid technical merits, but proving once again that a great movie must have more than good cinematography and sound. A truly superior movie must a decent,  or at least believable, story and that is what this movie lacks.

Typical Michael Mann: extremely slick, emotionally empty, all style, little substance, lots of men acting like men, throwing their testosterone around; quick cuts, flashes of color, loud rock and roll, very 80s.  What attracted Cruise to this non-character is a mystery, as he doesn't even get to show off his chops much.  Foxx is pretty good, but again, it's a one-dimensional character, mostly just reacting to what's going on around him.  As for the plot itself, it calls for a mighty suspension of disbelief.

1530744,4,B00005JN2Z,"Director:  Michael Mann

Cast:  Tom Cruise, Jamie Foxx, Jada Pinkett Smith, Mark Ruffalo, Peter Berg, Bruce McGill.

Rated R for lots of violence and language.

Running Time:  120 minutes.

Michael Mann, director of great films such as ""Heat"" and ""The Insider"", distributes another fine, tense thriller with ""Collateral"".  Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx star in extremely original roles for both:  Cruise as a bounty-hunter-like hit man who appears more like a cyborg terminator than a regular human being and Foxx as a timid cab driver who is continuously in search of his dreams.

While Max (Jamie Foxx) is on his routine Los Angeles cabbie job, he unfortunately picks up the fast-talking, intense Vincent (Cruise).  Vincent coerces Max to drive for him throughout the night for an extra profit, not knowing what horrific events are to unfold.  When the body of one of Vincent's victims lands on the top of car, Max realizes that this night is going to be like no other in the big city.  The strange duo drives from hit to hit, each creating more and more tension between them.  ""Collateral"" breezes along with crafty fashion to the electrifying climax in which Max must save a prosecutor (Jada Pinkett Smith) from the wraith of the merciless contract killer.

Cruise is spectacular in his role, bringing incredible wit and savvy to his character.  Just as in ""Jerry Maguire"" and ""Top Gun"", his performance as Vincent is one that he was born to play.  Foxx delivers his second best performance of the year (behind his Oscar-worthy work in ""Ray"") as the John Doe bus driver who just wants a better life for himself.  As the night escalates from a regular and peaceful to tormenting and fanatical, Foxx shows the audience the transformation of this ordinary man into a hero.  Director Michael Mann does a proficient job using the city of Los Angeles throughout the film, creating beautiful pans of the eloquent buildings and roadways that add to the angst of the picture.  A splendid rogue of a film, splicing elements of ""Taxi Driver"", ""The Terminator"", and the formula for the 80's slasher flicks.  The only downfall of the film is that writer Stuart Beattie's screenplay attempts to add a layer of philosophical inquiry throughout the film (particularly one taxi scene involving both Max and Vincent), but it does not seem to quite fit.  An excellent effort of terror and suspense.  One of the most unique of its kind.  All fans of Cruise will thoroughly enjoy.",1103673600,,2459,4.869879518072289
1530745,5,B00005JN2Z,"After the commercial failure and mixed critical reaction to the vastly underrated Ali, Michael Mann returns to familiar territory-the urban crime thriller-with Collateral. Coming off three grandiose epics in a row, the veteran filmmaker shifts gears with this lean, no-nonsense movie that harkens back to early films in his career like, Thief. Like the late Stanley Kubrick (of whom Mann is sometimes compared to), Mann has tried repeatedly to breakthrough to a mainstream audience. It would make sense then that he would cast Hollywood megastar Tom Cruise as one of the main protagonists. If there were any actor on the planet that could guarantee a sure-fire hit at the box office it would be Cruise. However, Mann throws a potential spanner in the works by casting the actor as an amoral hit man. Would this scare off a mainstream audience?

The first disc features an informative audio commentary track by director Michael Mann. The veteran filmmaker really did his homework as he talks about the realistic details used in the background of scenes and with various characters. He also talks at length about the characters' backstories and motivations.

The second disc starts off with ""City of Night: The Making of Collateral,"" a 41-minute look at how this film came together and was made. There is also footage of Tom Cruise training with a weapons expert so that he could credibly portray a professional assassin on screen. This is a step up above the usual electronic press kit material.

""Special Delivery"" takes a look at some of the research Cruise did for this role. In order to get into character, Mann disguised the actor as FedEx delivery man and had him deliver a package to a business in a crowded place and not get recognized. Included is actual footage of Cruise in action.

There is one deleted scene with commentary by Mann. It shows Vincent and Max going into LAX to lose the police and federal surveillance that is tracking them.

""Shooting on Location: Annie's Office"" examines the use of high-definition digital video used to capture Vincent stalking Annie in her darkened office at night. It is a scene that would have been impossible to render on traditional film.

""Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx Rehearse"" gives a glimpse into the creative process as we see footage of the two actors reading through a scene in Mann's office, juxtaposed with the final scene in the movie.

""Visual FX: MTA Train"" shows how Mann used a green screen effect on the climatic sequence on the train so that he could customize the backgrounds to suit his vision.

Finally, there are cast and crew biographies and extensive production notes.

Collateral is a fitting addition to Michael Mann's distinctive filmography. It continues his thematic pre-occupations of isolated protagonists who have little time for personal relationships. It is also deals with another Mann obsession: transformation. In order to have any chance of surviving the night with Vincent, Max must change from being a passive character to one that takes an active role in determining his own fate. It is the exploration of such weighty themes, coupled with Mann's distinctive style that elevates Collateral from its generic conventions.",1103673600,,3207,5.024482109227872
1530746,3,B00005JN2Z,"There are some great things about COLLATERAL.

Tom Cruise is phenominal in his performance. His techniques. The work he has done to look like a trained killer is fantastic. You believe he is who he says he is and you forget about the fact that he is Tom Cruise very quickly.

The production value is fantastic. Throughout the movie, the camera lets the action do the talking. Fight scenes and shootings are done with MINIMAL to NO EDITING. You see the action go down as you would if you were standing on the streets of Los Angeles along with them.

On the other hand, there are a lot of problems with Collateral. Plotting problems. Realism problems. Acting problems.

This movie IS BASED in REALITY. This is supposed to be REAL. This isn't a Schwarzenegger movie where otherworldly things happen, and Jamie Foxx is certainly no JOHN McCLANE (Die Hard) or JOHN RIGGS (Lethal Weapon).  So, when Jamie Foxx turns the tables on a L.A. street cop when he's about to be cuffed? Whoa. This guy is a cabbie.

Not to mention when he goes into a den of thugs upon Vincent's (Cruise) orders and is told what to say... he manages to come up with his own words??  GOOD ONES. Even threatening to kill one of the thugs. As if... maybe... he were no stranger to the crime game. As if he maybe had a little psychotic hitman in him... it was pretty unrealistic for a guy who was inspiring to be a CHAUFFER driver for celebrities.

At one point, there is a HIT going down in a nightclub. A Chinese mafia-type is being guarded by numerous bodyguards. So when the stuff starts going down... FIVE MINUTES LATER, this Chinese mafia-type guy is still sitting in the same place!!  Seemingly frozen in his seat. Only when the gun is finally trained on his head do his guards attempt to get him to a safe location.

Actually, this could have been a decent movie, but honestly, about midway things really started getting hard to believe, hard to accept and DID I FORGET TO MENTION THE COINCIDENCES that lead up to the ending... that was again... disappointing and unrealistic.

Finally, I know that Jamie Foxx is a very good actor. He proved that in RAY.  But in Collateral, I didn't like his performance. For a guy who is being held against his will, at gun point, forced to participate in murders, forced to watch murders, forced to carry bodies... he never sold me. His emotions never went far enough.

It seemed to me... that maybe murders, dead guys in trunks and people getting shot wasn't anything new to an L.A. cab driver. If that's what they were trying to get across, then maybe the objective was achieved.

I personally, would have liked to have seen more emotion and more desperation out of him.  Foxx was sorta bland.

Collateral is an okay movie that could have been much better had the writers figured a better way to keep things realistic and not so cliche.",1103587200,4,2846,4.540117416829745
1530790,5,B00005JN2Z,"I toyed with several titles, based on the overall quality of the film, as well as the subject matter: ""Driving Mr. Crazy"" because of Vincent's sociopathic nature, ""Cabbies, Beware! The Next Fare May Be Your Last,"" or ""Blonds DO HAVE more fun,"" in reference to Cruise's hair in the film.

However, when I think about the total package, I could only see a film of which Sir Alfred would give his seal of approval. Like ""Strangers on a Train,"" ""Collateral"" bonds two men from different worlds together, one unaware that he is about to be the ""accomplice"" in the other's night of murder for hire. Hitchcock in ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" and ""North by Northwest"" did the aspect of the innocent man drawn into a world of intrigue and crime. Mann casts Foxx as the innocent and the director draws brilliant performances from both actors as they ""play"" off each other like old friends.

Also, Mann, like Alfred, understands how the look is essential to the success of the film. The movie's setting, Los Angeles, takes on a part of its own, simultaneously looking both menacing and captivating. Only San Francisco in Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" looked more alluring.

The score by James Newton Howard, as well as the use of popular songs, is another fine element that Mann incorporates in this engaging thriller. Hitchcock, too, relied on music to tell his stories.

The second disc features a fascinating ""Making of..."" documentary wherein the viewer gets an in-depth look at the very meticulous Mr. Mann.

I would love to see Cruise, Foxx, and Pinkett-Smith in another film together, helmed by Michael Mann. Maybe, they can do a remake of ""North by Northwest"", with Cruise in the James Mason role, Foxx as Cary Grant's character, and Pinkett-Smith as the cool ""blonde"" played by Eva Marie Saint.

How can a killer walk into a club packed with police, kill the man he is looking for, and just get away? Too many questionable scenes like that in the movie.

1530792,4,B00005JN2Z,"Two men are about to cross paths unknowing of what consequences they will have upon each other.  Max (Jamie Foxx) is dreamer that has worked as a cab driver for 12 years while awaiting the moment when he has enough capital to invest in a Limousine company that will offer the ultimate ride for its passengers.  When fares begin to converse with Max he often brings up his vision of the Limo company, and one evening at the airport he meets a stunningly beautiful lawyer, Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith).  On their way to Annie's destination they begin to chat about music, her job, and his dreams, which eventually leads to Annie offering him her card as a token that she wants to see him again.

Bewildered in his thoughts Max remains seated in the cab after Annie has left when a new fare asks if the cab is taken, which breaks the spell on him.  The passenger in due time reveals his name as Vincent (Tom Cruise) while he probes Max of who he is, and then he tells Max that he has five stops to make and he can make $600 if he stays with him.  Hesitant Max considers the offer, however, Vincent appears as a tough negotiator as he pushes the money into his hand while telling that these offers do not happen often.  Max takes the money and parks in the alley where he begins to eat his supper while thumbing a Mercedes brochure.  However, this is the peaceful moment before the storm that is about to enter Max's life and turn it upside down.

Vincent has a cynical outlook on life that is heavily influenced by Darwinistic thinking and possibly Nietzsche as he believes that man has to seize the day, or the man might perish.  The moment of existence is now, not later, if one waits one misses an opportunity to make the most of the current situation.  This is what Vincent's life philosophy boils down to as he brings Max on an existential journey.  The two venture to a jazz club where Vincent and Max sit down and listen to the spontaneous jamming by the band on the stage.  Vincent wonders if Max can hear the sudden surprise that lays within the music, but Max is too preoccupied with his internal fear to give the music any thought.  At the end of the evening at the jazz club the cab driver and the passenger talk with Daniel, the owner and a musician, who recollects the moment when Miles Davis entered the club and how he missed his opportunity as a musician.

When Max and Vincent are between destinations Max receives a message over the radio that his mother is anxiously wondering about his whereabouts, as she is hospitalized and he visits her every evening.  Slightly amused over the situation Vincent looks at his watch and says that they have time for a quick stop.  When they enter the hospital Vincent reminds Max that his mother carried him in her uterus for nine months, and he must bring her flowers for which Vincent pays.  When they arrive to the room where Max's mother rests she continuously criticizes him while speaking softly and kindly to Vincent, which appears to be very difficult for Max.  It is evident to Vincent that Max never attempts to take the step from dream to reality, as Max seems to be preoccupied by insecurities and fears of failure, which seems rooted in Max's relationship to his mother.

In Seventh Seal (1957) Ingmar Bergman offers some insights to our existence as Antonius Block (Max von Sydow) plays a prolonged chess match with the Grim Reaper.  Collateral works in a similar manner as Seventh Seal.  Max is the guide to the destinations, as Block did in Seventh Seal, while Vincent is the person that follows much like the Grim Reaper.  Maybe it is far fetched to say that Collateral compares to the masterpiece Seventh Seal, however, the similarities are there in regards to existentialism.  The question is whether Max will learn anything from Vincent while visiting the five different destinations.

Michael Mann's Collateral is a solid cinematic experience that depicts serious philosophy through an action packed thriller.  The cast's performances provide genuine feel for who characters are, maybe the scene when Max pretends to be Vincent as he talks to Felix (Javier Bardem) is a little over the top, but it turns out to be one of those cool scenes where no one can get hurt.  The long opening before Max meets Vincent displays Mann's cunningness in direction as this provides a strong foundation that develops strong characters, which is needed for this story.  However, Mann does not reach the same level with Collateral as he did with Heat (1995) and The Insider (1999), yet he touches something deeper with this film as he dwells on existentialism and carpe diem.",1103500800,2,4629,4.632802937576499
1530793,5,B00005JN2Z,"One of the most satisfying movie experiences of the year, Collateral is a thrilling movie that doesn't exhibit any thriller cliches. This is a movie that prefers building an atmosphere of dread over using shock tactics, dialogue over violence, and atmosphere over frantic chases, and it still manages to be an incredibly engaging film. Of all the movies I saw this year, I will admit this to be among my favorites, and I am a bit of a film snob.

The thrust of the story concerns Tom Cruise's salt-and-pepper-haired hitman Vincent and Jamie Foxx's uber-professional cabbie Max. Credit where credit is due, Mark Ruffalo and Jada Pinkett-Smith both make very strong impressions in minor roles. This movie, however, is all about Vince and Max. Mann's use of striking imagery and perpetual darkness turn Los Angeles into a dark, almost mystical locale, and the mood is perfectly set for what follows. Max, of course, picks up Vincent at the airport and ferries him around the city of angels at gunpoint in order to off witnesses in a drug case. Max, you see, is intent on moving on to better things, but although he is a staunch professional, you get the sense that he's never going to get enough traction to move out of where he is. Ironically, Vincent provides the impetus he needs to move out of his corner, if he survives the night. Both the leads turn in what could be called the best performances of their careers: the suave, frigid Vincent is the role Cruise was born to play. He really gets into it here, and like his best performances, he gets to be cruel and edgy. Foxx is very moving in the film, endowing Max with great humanity. Overall, this is a hardly conventional and very enjoyable movie that I would wholeheartedly recommend to anyone looking for an intriguing character study and an invigorating film.",1103500800,2,1817,4.73186119873817
1530794,3,B00005JN2Z,"A stylish thriller, yes, but I found it very difficult to get past many of the preposterous holes in the logic of the film. The first two acts are good, anchored by Jamie Fox's self-assured character acting and Tom Cruise's surprisingly subtle approach. (Cruise is not often known for understating things on screen.) The plot holes are considerable, though, and I could only suspend disbelief until the AWFUL third act, which becomes an all-too-typical chase scene. I was disappointed.",1103500800,3,485,5.151898734177215
1530795,4,B00005JN2Z,"This film is a classic Michael Mann signature genre hit.  You know when a serial killer always has a signature. That signature will always be there. Can you see it? Can you feel it? ""Collateral"" is a signature Michael Mann crime thriller film all the way.

  ""Collateral"" is about a contract killer (Tom Cruise) who has ten hours to kill five people in Los Angeles. The unfortunate cab driver Max (Jamie Foxx) is in the wrong place wrong time when his next fair is Vincent (Mr. Cruise) For a mere $600.00, Max is thrust into driving this hired killer around to each contract or be killed himself. Vincent must be a killing machine to take five people in ten-hour scenario. And he IS.

  Tom Cruise absorbs Vincent's character and brings him to life. Vincent is well schooled and rehearsed in combat, tactical recovery and covert opperations. (And he utilizes them all!) The interaction between Max and Vincent is like a clash of opposite polar forces. Different views, personalities and upbringing are topics of discussion. Jamie Foxx plays Max's character superbly. Max's growth in the film is only supported by Jamie's vastly improved acting skills. Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx work well together in this film.

  The film takes on a ""24"" feel for time. But the length of the film is actually two hours. Jada Pinkett Smith takes on a supporting role as a prosecuting attorney. She compliments Foxx's on screen personality.

  If you are a Michael Mann fan, you will not be disappointed with this film. Who doesn't like Tom Cruise? Jamie Foxx? Okay then see it!

  Purchase the widescreen DVD only. Don't miss this bonus feature; ""City of Night: The Making of Collateral"" features the actual lead actors discussing their roles. N-I-C-E.",1103500800,,1735,4.850340136054422
1530796,3,B00005JN2Z,"cruise and foxx do a great job supporting their roles, and it's a pretty entertaining movie (until the horribly cheesy ending).  there are way too many flaws in the script, which i'm not going to elaborate on so i don't spoil this for anyone who hasn't seen it...but you'll see exactly what i'm talking about once you do.

overall- being a big tom cruise fan, it's awesome seeing him take on the role of a bad guy and cruise's scene in club fever is absolutely phenomenal!  so, this is what made watching collateral worthwhile.

i wouldn't recommend buying this movie for anything over $8-$10 new, but it's defenately a worthy rental.

1530798,5,B00005JN2Z,"I was impressed by this DVD. Of course, every commentary about art and artistic performances has to be subjective. Is a matter of taste. What is thrilling for me is boring for someone else.

This DVD includes comments by director/producer Michael Mann in the first of two disks. Contrary to what is customary, you can read a highlighted text. His remarks are intelligent and show to what degree of professionalism he and his actors were committed. Extraordinary.

Tom Cruise is an actor that has surprised me over and over. He is a master of his art. Not only that, he prepares each character in a complete and perfect way. As an example, he trained under the guidance of experts while learning to shoot. So what, you say? So did thousands of other actors. Well, maybe so, but Tom Cruise is one of the few who mastered the craft. He does not blink when he shoots, and that is the brand of the expert. Oh, by the way, Schwarzenegger blinks...

Jamie Foxx shows a wide range of expression in this movie and I expect him to offer us some serious performances in the future. For some reason, comedians are very good in dramatic roles.

All in all, this is a movie not to be forgotten. It will stick in your mind.",1103414400,,1208,4.4772727272727275

This film is an impressive thriller film combining clever dialogue with subtle dialogue and explosive action to rise the ranks easily to the top films of the year. Tom Cruise plays bad guy, hitman, Vincent (and plays a bad guy very well, by the way). Ala Hitchcock, the innocent man, Max (Jamie Foxx) gets in the way, gets involved, and gets thrown in the middle. Now, people are tooting Foxx's horn pretty early for an Oscar nod, but I think he should just settle for the fact that we'll take him seriously as an actor from now on, not just a comedian. The film dazzles, surprises, is barely guessable, and a lot of fun. And with dialogue that is so refreshingly unique and witty, I'm so pleased that this film boosts the stock of an otherwise weak year in film.",1103414400,,864,4.509554140127388

Tom Cruise does a fantastic job as Vincent, the contract hit man.  He pulls off this character with the skill and confidence of a great actor.  In addition, he must have had some excellent technical trainers, because he displays some outstanding combat shooting techniques.  His confrontation with the two goblins in the alley who had just robbed Jamie Fox is worth replaying a couple of times on slow motion.

Jamie Fox also shines as the Taxi driver.  His transformation through the movie kept my interest going until the end.

1530930,4,B00005JN2Z,"""Collateral"" isn't just one of the best thrillers of the year, it's one of the best American movies of the year. Admittedly, 2004 has been a fairly weak one for exceptional films, but ""Collateral' could hold it's own in any recent year. It becomes more than a little implausible towards the end, but, as in a lot of great movies, you don't really think about this until after long after the final credits have rolled.

""Collateral"" reaffirms my belief that a great action film isn't just about great action, it's also about great characters, which comes from great screenwriting and great acting. ""Collateral"" takes the time to define the main characters, Vincent [Tom Cruise] and Max [Jamie Foxx], and allows the actors to actually act.

Max is a Los Angeles cab driver. He has conned himself into believing that, even though he's been a taxi driver for twelve years, some day soon he'll realize his dream of operating a limo service in some island paradise. One night he picks up a fare, Vincent, who offers him $600 to drive him to five stops over the course of the night. What Max doesn't know is that Vincent is a contract killer. The five stops are to eliminate five witness from a gang-related Federal trial. In a perfect world, Max might have been none the wiser. Vincent would have gotten out of the cab and quietly done his business. As luck would have it, though, the first victim falls out of a third story window and lands right on the unsuspecting Max's waiting cab. The rest of the night turns into chaos.

Between each `hit'. Vincent and Max get to know each other a little better, and the audience gets to know the characters better, thus allowing a greater involvement in this deadly cat and mouse game.

In a way, ""Collateral"" is an `homage' to the great Alfred Hitchcock, whose persistent theme was that of an innocent man's being caught up in a web woven by a villain. Director Michael Mann, though, takes the genre and creates something uniquely his own - a masterful thriller in its own right.",1103414400,2,2016,4.638655462184874
1530931,5,B00005JN2Z,"This is just great movie, maybe best of the year, which is interesting, since the plot, when I heard about it, didn't strike me as particulary original (boy was I wrong).  It's also Mann's best since ""Heat,"" and to some extent even better than that also-great movie. In ""Collateral"" Mann shrinks the scope considerably, stripping it down to the bare essentials. Oh, there's a wider cast, a plot, and those wonderful camera shots of the city, but what's happening, always, is in the cab, with killer and cabbie. Cruise is a killing machine, but unlike Arnold, he actually acts. The little tics, those eyes, the clipped delivery of lines, Mann burns the reality of the killer right into you. You believe, without doubt, that Cruise -- so often a hero in other flicks -- is a very bad man. Fox is also a good, understated, foil, with his dreams and hopes, colliding with a nightmare (and noirish) journey into the American night. What chance does he have? Watch and see.",1103328000,,967,4.688235294117647
1530932,4,B00005JN2Z,"One of the ways we get hooked into movies is the ""this could happen"" feeling. Even when Ridley faces The Alien, if we've been brought along carefully, we say 'this could happen.'

Of course nothing we see in Hollywood really could happen, Aliens and hitmen notwithstanding, so when the well coiffed, highly intelligent, money to burn assassin Vincent has been assigned to murder 5 key witnesses to the Federal trial of a billionaire drug lord, that ""this COULDN'T happen"" feeling starts to rise for a couple of reasons.

You probably think with money to burn, a Joseph Aboud suit, and a $10,000 laptop in hand, why would the intelligent hitman get into a Los Angeles cab? Well, yeah, that's a problem for me. But the real problem is  . . . .the trial is TOMORROW. Vincent is going to wait 12 hours before opening statement to kill off the evidence? Why are the witnesses not in protective custody instead of making a pizza in a two bedroom flat in Venice, making out with two hot women in a West LA penthouses, and rocking 'n rolling in a club Beverly Hills THE NIGHT BEFORE A FEDERAL TRIAL? What if Jaime Foxx didn't speak English? What if they got a flat tire, a back-up on the 405 or LA smog?

Having said that, Cruise is brilliant as the intelligent hitman, and Foxx as the bright but procrastinating cabbie. Jada Pinkett-Smith is absolutely gorgeous and plays a nice supporting role. The photography nearly steals the show, very slick like the Miami Vice days and always present as both a scene setter and conversationalist. But the movie lacks that sinister evil of To Live and Die, Body Heat and the much earlier Bullit, and seems confused as to whether it wants to be a slick shoot 'em up mystery or a series of ""My Dinner with Andre"" conversations between Vincent and Max.

Kudos to Cruise and Foxx who do a nice morphing of the other's best characteristics, Vincent showing a hint of introspection and compassion at the end and Max more decisiveness. 4 stars. Larry Scantlebury",1103328000,,1987,4.6335227272727275
1530933,5,B00005JN2Z,"Collateral proves that there are many great actors out there who have yet to show how well they can shine given a great script.

Collateral's plot isn't very complex. A cab driver takes a hitman from hit to hit, trying in vain to stop the sociopathic killer before he can get away with his crimes. But the plot isn't what makes this movie great, it's the characters, their intelligence, and relationships to one another. One point that shows how much deeper this movie's characters are compared to most others is a scene in which Vincent (Cruise), a hitman, saves the life of Max (Foxx), the cab driver, despite Max's repeated attempts at thwarting Vincent. They stop and stare at each other, Max in confusion, Vincent with understanding and strength. It's as though Vincent is telling Max that he knows Max is incapable of stopping him, and that b/c of this, Vincent is willing to protect someone who, on a strange level, has almost become a friend in his lonely life.

These scenes wouldn't work at all if it wasn't for the fantastic acting. I never had much faith in Jamie Foxx as a serious actor, but after this movie and Ray, I have completely changed my opinion. Collateral shows exactly how wide a range he has as an actor. And Tom Cruise as a serious villain is perfection. Cruise has been missing his calling by playing random, throw-away heroes. The deep character of Vincent plays to all of Cruise's strengths as an actor and adds magnificently to the movie.

For a great drama, with very good acting, writing, and a few edge-of-your seat moments, I cannot recommend Collateral enough.",1103328000,2,1596,4.71326164874552
1530934,4,B00005JN2Z,"Tom Cruise and especially Jamie Foxx both shine in this hard edged crime thriller, masterfully helmed by Michael Mann (Heat, Manhunter).  For most of it's two hour running time, Collateral combines both an intricate character study and some intense action set pieces that make it a joy to watch, beginning with cool, calm, and calculated hitman Vincent (Cruise) hitching a ride with taxi driver Max (Foxx).  Max has big dreams and grand ideas and little to show for it, something Vincent uses to his advantage as he takes Max hostage to make his rounds of the night which include the executions of five people.  The interplay between Cruise and Foxx is undoubtadly Collateral's strong point, with Foxx giving a knockout performance and Cruise's surprising performance as one of the best screen villains in the past few years.  However, Collateral loses steam as it approaches it's climax when the tables are turned and a cat & mouse game ensues that ends on an MTA train.  Other than that, everything else about Collateral is nearly flawless, and it is definitely one of the best films to be released this year.  The cast also features Jada Pinkett-Smith, Mark Ruffalo, Peter Berg, and look for a cameo in the opening scene from Jason Statham (The Transporter, Cellular, Snatch).",1103241600,,1279,4.953271028037383
1530935,4,B00005JN2Z,"Tom Cruise has gotten a bad rap when it comes to dramatic roles. I for one think he is underrated. If this role doesn't convince you of his great skills, I don't know what will. He plays a hired killer named Vincent, with 6 hits to carry out. When he first hires a cab driver named Max played by Jamie Foxx we think he seems like an average man. As the story unfolds and Foxx and us realize what he is capable of doing, we are in shock and awe. Foxx is excellent in this role. Typically he has been type cast in comedies, but he shows he is quite capable of dramatic roles as well. He does a great job of playing an average man that is caught up in something he can't escape without taking drastic measures.

I am a fan of Michael Mann and I am glad to see him direct another great movie. Scenes such as Max stopping for a Coyote, show how he is humane. While Vincent shows us how cold blooded he can be killing a Jazz club owner after talking to him about jazz. Any fan of movies like ""Manhunter"", ""Heat"", or Tarantino movies will definitely want to buy it. The style that Mann uses to show the dark side of the city and human nature is excellent. The quality of the DVD is first class and the extras include documentary, deleted scenes, cast, filmakers, and production notes, and more.

Not alot of scenery, Not but about 5 or six characters.  The second reason was because you just did not get a chance to know the characters.  They all had very brief introductions.  You never knew who Cruise worked for or who worked for him. Foxx's character had the most involvement of the major characters. Yet you barely knew him.  they should have used more time to get you involved with each of the character's lives. When u don't get a chance to know the characters, it is harder to relate to them.

If you liked the film Heat then the chances of you liking this film are very high. Although the story sometimes seems a little predictable and unprobable it's a great one. Tom Cruise plays a hitman named Vincent, which he portrays beautifully, on a job in L.A. where he has a taxi chauffeur him around to his 5 hits. Max, portrayed by the extremely talented Jamie Foxx, is the cab driver Vincent decides to take a ride from. On their trail is Detective Fanning, a great supporting character played by Mark Ruffalo. In my opinion this is a performance for Tom Cruise that shows his acting talents better than ever before. Although Tom Cruise is great he is slightly upstaged by Jamie Foxx. In a role that shows his acting talents better than before, Foxx is wonderful as the down to earth and funny Max.

All I can tell you is if you are a fan of Cruise or Foxx, you will enjoy this movie for the fact that you get to see them in a different light.",1103241600,,525,3.8256880733944953
1530996,5,B00005JN2Z,"This film is special on so many fronts.  The way that the film is shot and how Mann makes nocturnal Los Angeles a living character is just outstanding.  Cruise and Foxx are at the top of their respective games, each going against type and performing close to flawlessly.  A nod should also go to Jada Pinkett Smith, one of the more underrated actresses at present; she maximizes her limited role into someone who you can actually care about.

I will say a word about the screenplay, which has been criticized.  Yes, the ending is a little formulaic as I also had this perverse interest in seeing Vincent finish the job.  But I also wound up really liking Max and hoped that he and Smith's character, whose name escapes me, would have a future.  But because the ending is formulaic does not mean it was not expertly crafted, which I think this ending is.  As for the believability of the plot itself, I doubt if there are many films out there that are believable or that don't take strong creative liberties with material that seems real.  Like most of the art out there, its whether the story and the characters intertwined have something to say, make to care about them or what they are doing, and whether there is a message you can get from what is being said.  I think this film does all three.  You hate it that you like Vincent, but there is something about his twisted sociopathic view of the world that you can emphasize this and almost understand.  You like the fact that Max becomes more brazen as the film progresses, realizing that sometimes you have to take a risk or two.  You care about Max and Vincent's relationship and you are interested to see what happens between the two of them.  Finally, the way that nocturnal L.A. is this breathing beast that is both beautiful and ugly, on the edge of being overrun by the coyotes and other more primitive elements. The film really reminds you of how anonymous most people are, despite the fact that the main three characters find themselves intertwined.  But without those coincidences, there would be no story and while the story may stretch reality some, we don't ALWAYS go to the movies or read novels to not have SOME suspension of total reality (the coffee shop scene in Heat, however implausible, was one of the greatest scenes in the past 20 years).

I loved this film.  I'd rank it as high as Heat and it is easily one of my favorites of all time.  I recognize I probably liked it more than most, but I promise you that Collateral will linger in your mind far longer than the vast majority of films being made.",1103241600,3,2577,4.517241379310345

I thought I had it pegged from the commercials - that Tom Cruise is a hit man, and that Jamie Foxx finally outsmarts him.  Not quite.  Nothing that predictable happens in the movie.  Tom Cruise gives a terrific performance in his first, all-out villain role (not counting the anti-hero, Lestat), with a head of prematurely gray hair.  He attacks the part with his trademark enthusiasm, and is truly breathtaking when he is called upon to use violence.  Jamie Foxx is proving that he is quite an actor in development.  Michael Mann, one of our best directors, wisely avoids the stereotype of making the race-card a factor between these two opponents: Cruise likes and respects Foxx, and thinks he is helping him out.

Michael Mann's masterpiece is Heat - another film about Los Angeles by night.  This one is not as epic in scope - in fact, it all takes place in one night - but it still inhabits the same world of shadow-people.  One thing that nobody seems to be talking about - this movie LOOKS LIKE IT WAS SHOT ON DIGITAL.  Video has a different look than film, and I'm surprised to see Michael Mann go for it.

1531000,3,B00005JN2Z,"Being a huge Tom Cruise fan, I bought this sight unseen. Cruise continues to pick projects that showcase his growth as one of our finest actors. THE LAST SAMURAI, MAGNOLIA, EYES WIDE SHUT, MINORITY REPORT, RAIN MAN, A FEW GOOD MEN, BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY, and a film that has leaped into my top five films of all time, VANILLA SKY. (At the time, Cruise said it was his favorite film to date. You got that right.)

I could have cared less about Jamie Foxx being in this. The fact that he was in this made me reconsider buying it. Comedian turned actor? Forget it. Okay, I was wrong. His performance proves he has the chops to become a great actor. Foxx is very good in this film. So why only three STARS?

This film has everything going for it: great acting, beautiful cinematography, masterful direction, nice editing, great soundtrack, and some good action sequences. Even the dialogue, at times, is marvelous. BUT THERE IS NOT A SINGLE SCENE IN THIS FILM THAT IS BELIEVABLE. Not one. As you move from scene to scene in this film you realize that every situation and set-up here is ABSOLUTELY IMPLAUSIBLE and TELEGRAPHED. None of this makes any sense. It's important to be able to suspend disbelief in a film like this, but I don't think anyone went past the first draft of the screenplay. Too bad. I guess everyone was excited about doing a Michael Mann film. I've seen this sort of implausibility from Mann before. I'm referring to the scene from HEAT when Al Pacino and Robert De Niro have coffee together. And the scene where Val Kilmer slips through the LAPD roadblock at the end of the film. But you overlook it because it's such a great film. Let's face it, Mann is known for doing macho male fantasy flicks, so you expect it going in. But the script for COLLATERAL is SO ABSURD that it makes it hard to enjoy the film.

FOR EXAMPLE: At the start, Cruise, the hitman, makes a bag swap and passes through airport security by going down some secret stairwell fully armed. Sure he does. Foxx, the cabby, picks up Jada Pinkett, the beautiful prosecutor, at the beginning of the film and SHE gives HIM her phone number. What? An L.A. TEN? Not in this town. I live here. Not unless he owned a Porsche. What a guy!! Moments later, Cruise gets in the same cab for a night of murder, fun, and jazz. Later the prosecutor turns up on Cruise's hit-list and guess who has the number to call and warn her? That's right!! What a coincidence!! To quote from this movie, ""L.A. is home to 17 million people who don't know each other."" The stars in this flick certainly do. After a victim falls out of a window onto the cab causing a very loud crash, Foxx and Cruise argue and hide the body in the trunk because now, Foxx is a hostage. Only one witness sees something, but he has ""coke-bottle glasses"" and the cops can't use the information. Very convenient!! A real hitman would have left the body right where it was. Evidence and all. Later, the cops find evidence of bloody glass at the scene anyway, so Cruise must have forgotten the dustpan and broom to fully cover-up the hit. He did use a waterbottle on the cab to wash off the blood. What a genius!! Meanwhile, on the other side of town, a police cruiser cherries the cab which is carrying Cruise, Foxx, and the dead body in the trunk. The patrolmen spot some blood on the windshield after Foxx tells them he hit a deer in South Central, and with  some suspicion are ready to open the trunk. (Remember, Cruise is supposed to be an ultra-intelligent hitman.) But, they get a ""shots fired"" call and have to leave in a hurry. Very convenient indeed!! But these moronic cops still find time to call in the damaged cab. These are very civic minded police officers taking time out from their busy night to phone the cab company!! Foxx's dispatcher calls and wants him to return the cab because the cops called in his broken windshield. Cruise grabs the radio and mouths off to the dispatcher. Some time later, because he's one shrewd hitman, Cruise escorts Foxx to the hospital to see his sick mother because he doesn't want Foxx to break his normal routine. ""Someone may come looking for you."" What a professional!! At the hospital they get on the elevator with the cop who's investigating the murders. Phew!! That was close!! It's the same hospital where the murder victims are stashed. Another coincidence!! Are you buying into this yet? IT GETS WORSE. Foxx throws away Cruise's computer containing all his hit addresses. Darn it all!! A pro would have memorized them so there would be little or no evidence on his person. I'm thinking Chuck Bronson in THE MECHANIC. But the screenwriter wasn't. He'd also be tossing weapons. (And he certainly wouldn't use a cab driver to cover-up his hits.) So, being the unbelievably clever hitman that he is, Cruise gets Foxx to wander into the club of his Columbian drug dealing employer so Foxx can, get this, pretend that HE'S the hitman-for-hire and get the addresses that Cruise so unwittingly lost. (I wouldn't hire Cruise's character to rent out shoes in a bowling alley.) And Foxx steps up to the plate with some cool gangsta posing of his own and scores those elusive little addresses. Of course, Cruise just knew that he could act the part. Then, to top it all off, Cruise is surrounded in a nightclub by murderous drug dealers and cops, who have cordoned off the building. But, he still manages to make the hit and escape in the very same cab that the cops have been looking for. It's parked right out front. Your kidding, right? I wish I was. (groan)Ohhhhhh... On and on. Ad nauseam. I know 6th graders who are smarter movie goers than this!! This script is just DUMB. (That's what professional screenwriter's call amateur writing.)

Michael Mann's best films are still THIEF, MANHUNTER, and HEAT.

This film gets one STAR each for Tom Cruise, Jamie Foxx, and Michael Mann's amazing Los Angeles. Bubblegum action fans may like this one. I'm going to watch COLLATERAL again before I sell it, because it is beautiful to look at. I wanted to like this film. I really did. But the script is AWFUL. (Okay, I tried. I just can't get through it twice. Bleech!!)",1103155200,5,6151,4.561990950226244
1531001,4,B00005JN2Z,"Michael Mann's slick, ultra violent thriller ""Collateral"" serves as a worthy coming out party for the non comedic talents of Jamie Foxx.  Foxx playing ambitious L.A. cabbie Max Durocher becomes an unwitting accomplice, at gunpoint, to smooth and unruffled hitman Vincent played by a grey coiffed Tom Cruise.

Cruise has been employed by a drug kingpin known as Felix who is about to be indicted by federal prosecutors.  Cruise's task is to assassinate five witnesses that have been hidden by both the FBI and L.A.P.D.  He is using Foxx and his cab to chauffeur him his various assignments.  When his first victim falls through a 4th floor window onto the roof of Foxx's cab the reality of the frightful adventure commences.

Prior to Foxx's initial brush with Cruise he had picked up federal attorney the beautiful Jada Pinkett Smith.  Their innocent but somewhat hard to believe conversation and encounter,

will have major relevance to the later developement of the plot.

Mann's direction keeps the flick moving at a crisp pace. The camera work is effective in accomplishing this especially in the frenetic gun battle in the night club.  The interplay between Cruise and Foxx is superb and heightens the character developement to make them both believable and sympathetic.  The musical score is quite good as well.",1103068800,,1317,5.050925925925926
1531002,5,B00005JN2Z,"The plot is simple. A contract killer is in town (LA) for one night. Five targets. Five locations. He hijacks a cab driver and holds him hostage while he does his rounds.

Cruise as Vincent the killer expounds and philosophicizes on the ends of life to Max played by Jamie Foxx. The whole film is just that. Two strangers from different backgrounds, brought together by unforeseen circumstances and communicates with each other on a personal level.

What sets this movie apart from other conventional thrillers is the smart script and gritty, fly on the wall direction from Michael Mann. Mann, no stranger to the city of LA, paints a grimy picture of the city of angels. It's a dog-eat-dog world, filled with junkies, cops and drug cartels. This is easily Mann's best film in recent years. I didn't like Ali. It looks like a mess, Mann was being ""miscast"" as a director for that. He should have stuck to what he does best, urban crime thrillers (Miami Vice, Heat, Manhunter)

This 2-disc set is a revealation. Initially, I resented having the special features separated on another disc but from the first frame of the feature presentation, you can see where the space of the disc go to. The picture is excellent with the contrast and hues being distinct. Although the whole movie is being set at night, each character's face is remarkably sharp. I suspect that Mann might have shot the movie on digital.

The extras are SOP. We have the obligatory interviews with the director and the stars. Also we have the making of featurettes and as well as an emphasis on the FX aspect of the movie. The trailers are however lacking. The trailers for The Bourne Supremacy and Ron Burgundy:Anchorman are included here, but Collateral's teaser or trailer is not included here. Weird, considering that Bourne Supremacy is released by Universal whereas Collateral is a Dreamworks/Paramound production.",1103068800,,1886,4.884375

1531004,2,B00005JN2Z,"As far as big-studio Hollywood movies go, this is a worthy movie delivered in a subtly slick fashion, wrapped around a good heart -- namely that of Jamie Foxx's character, a cab driver who aspires to be more, and perhaps in another life, his big heart would have taken him onto a more lucrative path, or one more fulfilling. His dreams lead him to get into his cab everyday, serving people who have places to go, helping them along their own dreams, while his own get put on hold. But the movie's not as deep as it sounds. It's a rather straightforward, simple movie that goes easily on a linear path from point A to point B. If it weren't for Jamie Foxx's well-delivered, kind-hearted portrayal, (one that we can readily feel/empathize with), this movie would be yet another one for the low-budget, clearance bin. This is a step in the right direction for American filmmakers and studios who tend to place CGI, special effects and car chases over everything else, but the film as a whole lacks heart -- and simply having ""quiet"" scenes with melancholy music as Foxx's character's cab drives lonely, nighttime stretches of highway doesn't substitute for substance/depth. If only the film aimed a little bit higher, for a more wise, intelligent audience, it could have been one to buy and deserve repeated viewings. But as it is, it's a nice-looking, ultimately feel-good movie colored with dark blue hew of night. And unfortunately, once it hits its near-the-end climax, most viewers will already know what's going to happen and who's going to be there at the end as the credits roll. If only it aimed a little higher, and not for the simpleton audiences that regard the likes of ""The Last Samurai,"" ""Pearl Harbor"" (with Ben Affleck) and other big-name blockbuster-type movies as great films. As it stands, it's a mere, superficially entertaining movie which tries to pass off slick cinematography and melancholy notes as heart/substance -- a nice diversion for a couple hours, but not all too memorable, with little that you can't catch upon your first viewing.",1103068800,5,2062,4.8441926345609065

Cruise plays a heartless hitman, and does a believable job at it. Just as I was thinking ""There is something wrong with this guy - his upbringing must have been crap or some genetic psychological problem."" Max, the cab driver, pointed out pretty much the same thing.

There are some rather ordinary clichs throughout the film, such as Cruise's smooth grey suit and shades, the plot `twist' is predictable and horribly clichd, the final outcome in the film is much the same. But, I just adored watching the relationship between Vincent (Cruise) and the taxi driver Max (Foxx), truly enthralling. The borders a man has before his action appears inhumane...and Max's borders are pushed to the extreme driving the soave hitman to his next victims. You feel Max knows he's doing wrong, he tries to take action but can't. The borders between humane and inhumane seem non-existent in Vincent, yet he shows he has feelings, emotions, he shows he is a moral human being.

Collateral is a slick, arty action/psychological thriller full of some great scenes. But I just felt a missed opportunity rising towards the end, a better ending would put this film miles ahead.",1101859200,5,1131,4.794871794871795

1531107,4,B00005JN2Z,"Michael Mann's new thriller cannot boast the ingenious script -- it's full of holes -- but it is still a taut, stylish one with good acting from Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx.  It's not long and self-important saga of 'Ali'; it's more like 'Heat' where tension rises as characters are driven to the edges.

It's Los Angels Airport, where the story starts.  Tom Cruise's guy Vincent receives a bag from another guy (slyly cast cameo of the British star of 'Transporter').  Vincent, apparently a cool businessman on trip, has to do some jobs within a day, as you see later.

And Jamie Foxx is a taxi driver Max, hard-working, honest, and believing that he can do his own business one of these days, and has spent more than 10 years doing the same thing.  Now, Vincent hires Max, offering a lucrative ride, which turns out a very unusual one, for at the first place the taxi are headed for, a dead body falls down from the fourth floor.

Right, this is a change of pace for Tom Cruise, Mr. Nice Guy whose CV includes 'Top Gun' and 'Mission Impossible.'  This time, however, he plays a calculating, chilly man from underworld, who knows how to kill without mercy, but has his own philosophy of life.  It's contradicatory, but Tom Cruise manages to be the merciless killer with great skills.

Besides Jamie Foxx who is very convincing as Mr. Everyman  easily intimidated at first, but gradually changing to somebody else, Jada Pinkett Smith, Mark Ruffalo, Peter Berg, and Bruce McGill appear, plus Irma P Hall ('The Ladykiller') who adds a precious tone of comic relief to the noir.

But the film is without doubt Mann's, or I should say, Mann's images of LA at night.  He not only lives in the city, but knows the city, and the 'sprawling' city ('Vincent's word) with many faces plays the most important role in the film.

The most regrettable thing is the story of Stuart Beattie which is full of plot-holls.  Think about it.  A real  professional killer would drive his own car, instead of taking a cab, for instance, and the such items as the silly FBI or ineffective witness protection belong to the B movie cliche.

Still, Mann succeeds in making the film quite gripping  thriller, with the great use of LA landscapes.  Don't think too much when watching it.  Just prepare to be entertained.",1100217600,6,2288,4.641791044776119
1531108,3,B00005JN2Z,"Director Michael Mann takes a new turn (probably for the worse) in this new action thriller starring Tom Cruise.

Where previous installments (The Insider, Heat) were slow burners, guaranteed to satisfy eventually, Collateral starts with fire in the belly, at relatively fast pace, but loses momentum midway through.

Essential Mann characteristics are present though, from masterful filming sequences, to an excellent soundtrack, but the flick remains one step behind the director's standards.

Tom Cruise, cast against (very well known) type, plays Vincent, a serial killer on a mission to kill five witnesses on one long night, and needs a cabbie to ""fulfill his needs"".

He accidentally stumbles upon Max (excellently played by Jamie Foxx, in his best role to date), and takes him for a long ride full of unpleasant and frightening surprises.

At first, the action and weird, funny dialogues suck you in, but once the third murder is accomplished, and Vincent pays a visit to Max's mom in the hospital, we get the feeling that the movie is heading nowhere and it loses credibility.

The fact that the fifth victim happens to be the woman Max met earlier in the evening, and developed a sudden crush on her, fails enormously to convince.

The useless side story with the LA police and the FBI doesn't help much either.

1531110,2,B00005JN2Z,"Even though we haven't seen this type of taxi-adventure-ride before, we sure have seen films failing despite a cool setting because of a very weak plot. Lots of them too.

  ""Collateral"" has a solid premise to take off from, but the scriptwriter does a lousy job executing (pun intended) his job.

  As a ""too-bad-not-to-wear-shades"" contract killer hires a cab in his route to deliver 5 very important hits in one long night weird twists start tangling up as the cab-driver and the killer find themselves all caught up in a fate game.

  Sounds good? I thought so too which is why i ended up in the movie theater seeing this. But then, just as the problems begin for the hostage taken cab-driver so do those for the viewers.

  Tom Cruise (playing the hitman) is not a bad cast for this per ce, he's even given some above average dialogue to work with, but he's also made into a walking cliche. Slick suit outfit, obligatory shades, able to use slang as well as namedrop I Ching and Buddhism all in a night's work, hi-tech gadgets, bad-a** walking style, it all looks like he was ripped out of a manga strip and inserted into this movie.

  The cab-driver, hmm, well, there we have an attempt to work away from the cliches which fails because it's too rare a picture (and too awkward) to be believed: clean, punctual, orderly, a genius for the fastest route available (timed to the minute), philosophical, charming, among a variety of other virtues. Sounds like your average big-city cabbie to you? Didn't think so. Far from even? Right on.

  All this could've worked despite its clumsiness. As said above, the dialogue is not bad, there's a couple of brilliant punchlines, the subtle humor is well mixed-in. Following par is the cinematography, the photography, and the direction. L.A is given a pretty smooth nocturnal look and the characters flow through the city streets in their cab effortlessly. There's a maze but they are not hindered. It's all charming really and this is quite undeniable. The setting is achieved in convincing manner.

  But.

  Yes, there is a a but, and perhaps predictably it's the plot. Stretched so much you'll think it's about to snap any given moment and shatters will jump out of the screen, it undermines all and whatever good things ""Collateral"" has to offer. Stretched so much in fact, that at times i thought whether the scriptwriter was actually intending a very dark comedy but failed spectacularly to bring it across as such.

  Giving away all the plot failures would obviously spoil it for those that haven't seen the film (which might be a good thing actually) so I'll sum it all up saying that when the supposedly big twist arrives towards the end of the film it's so cheesy the screen almost turns yellow with holes. For the viewer who's long past the impressionable stage, the plot cracks will become apparent within the very first half hour and will only increase dramatically as the film progresses. They are that obvious.

  Which is a pity of course, because ""Collateral"" does have great potential written all over it especially because the idea behind it is very intriguing.

  As has been proven though in the past, it becomes for once more apparent that no matter how good the rest of the components of a film are, if the script is not solid the whole construction starts crumbling right before your eyes. We've seen far too many such crumblings before to tolerate one more, haven't we?",1098316800,7,3443,4.7327731092436975

Most people were furious with the film's ending: a professional contract killer is defeated by a lowly cab driver.  However, the beauty of the film is in Vincent's stoical death.  He dies without any complaint or pain.  One must look at Vincent's actions earlier in the film to understand the ending.  Vincent(Cruise) is a true existentialist.  He does not recognize the sanctity of human life because he does not subscribe to the presence of natural law.  To him, life and the world are nothing more than a compilation of atoms and cells.  Absurdly, Vincent sees his job, killing people, as no different than Foxx's job of driving a taxi.  In the existential world, people struggle for their lives to have some higher meaning or foundation.  The reality that Vincent has found is that he is not an individual but part of this huge empty world.  Vincent's death on the train shows paradoxically that nothing means anything.

Ultimately, this isn't a plot-driven thriller - it's the story of a man who is given the chance to take a stand and thereby prove to himself that he has what it takes to change his life.  For that kind of story, plot runs a distant second to character - and there's absolutely nothing formulaic about Stuart Beattie's wonderfully original characters, nor the ways in which Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx bring them so vividly to life.  The strength of characterization in the writing and performances is phenomenal (check out how much we learn about Max in the cab depot before he says even a single word).  Tom Cruise might be all over the posters for this movie - and there is a lot of pleasure to be had in seeing him play a mesmerizingly ruthless bad guy - but Jamie Foxx is the real star.  He walks the line between strength and vulnerability so expertly you never know which side of it he's likely to fall.  The situations Beattie's script puts them in are wonderfully unsettling, the dialogue is crisp and intelligent, and the music and editing conspire perfectly to create an experience which is horribly unnerving but never less than totally compelling.

Beyond the solid direction, there's very little original territory here.

I must say that I knew nothing about this movie when I walked in.  I did not know that Tom Cruise was the villain, something that people have payed way too much attention to.  If they cast Michael Jackson as a missionary it doesn't make it neccesarily a good film.  Similarly, casting Jamie Foxx as a non-comedian is no bolder than casting rap stars on Law and Order Special Victims Unit.  Casting two actors agaisnt type won't overcome a hackneyed script.

1531209,5,B00005JN2Z,"Let me get this out for you impatient folks.

Watch this movie now. Right now. Do not go to your girlfriend's house, do not go to the bank. Go now, break in if you don't have cash, hijack the damn theatre if you absolutely have to.

There is no descriptive phrase in any appropriate language to totally convey the intensity of this film. Over recent films, (Most notably Bourne Supremacy and The Manchurian Candidate), I complained about inappropriate use of ""documentary""-style shots (i.e., Handicam, Steadycam, etc.). Perhaps not inappropriate, but it was done to the point of making your eyes hurt. That's not particularly enjoyable.

The reason why I complained is that they could be much, much better. How I know this is because of Michael Mann, director of Manhunter, The Insider, Heat, Ali and of the most classic of Miami Vice episodes. He is considered one of the best innovative filmmakers of all time in terms of cinematography, if not the best.

However, if there was any doubt that he was number one, Collateral has officially obliterated any argument anyone might have about his skills.

If anyone has seen the cancelled Robbery Homicide TV show (starring Tom Sizemore), they'll recognize the style and atmosphere of Collateral immediately. If you have been not paying attention to anything said about this movie, the basic premise is simple: Jamie Foxx is a cab driver who picks up Tom Cruise as a fare, only Cruise is a hit man who has five people to kill by the end of the day, and needs the driver to get him around Los Angeles.

If you've been to Los Angeles, you will quickly recognize that the feel of the locations used in this film are definitely the City of Angels. It's not closed in and utterly urban as New York is, or as nightclub-touristy as Miami. This is SoCal, the wide open sprawl where anyone can meet anyone, but no one really does.

To say Tom Cruise is excellent would be on par with saying Russel Crowe's Maximus was an above average performance. I have not seen a more real character in my life. This is the performance that everyone hopes they can muster up one day but never do. You are frightened, intrigued, and ultimately riveted by every solitary second that Cruise is on screen. There is an undercurrent of emotions running through him and you can feel it, yet there is no change in his breathing, facial features or speech. The only way possible to explain it is that he has an aura about him that is rarely captured on film, and whether that's credit to Mann or Cruise or both is totally up to debate.

Jamie Foxx is likewise excellent. He is a real human being, he is trying his hardest to stay alive, but Foxx does not portray him over the top. He is understated, freezing up like anyone else would do instinctively, and we all are putting ourselves in his shoes. There is a vulnerability throughout the film just by Foxx's eyes that you are entranced by and can't help but hope that he'll make it out of here. This is the film that will launch Foxx's dramatic career.

The secondary cast does not have much of a role, but what we do see is superb. Mark Ruffalo is a narc officer and we are always hoping that eventually he will catch up. He is also a driven, but understated character and his few scenes do shine, in that underworld grit sort of way. Peter Berg is his supervising officer, and having always liked Berg, he reminds me why I keep track of his career.

It's been about half an hour after watching this film, and my heart is still pumping. If you thought Black Hawk Down was an intense movie, you have no idea what you are in for with Collateral. This makes Black Hawk Down seem like nothing short of a very loud and fast moving film in comparison, and Black Hawk Down is on my favorite DVD lists.

I wish there was more I could say, but to be perfectly honest, I'm simply speechless and I am reminded why I never watch Michael Mann any later than the film's opening night in the theatres.",1097107200,3,3953,4.506983240223463

1531211,5,B00005JN2Z,"Since the very start, Mann takes his time to develop depth in this movie's characters.  Spending valuable plenty ""Hollywood minutes"" from the onset, to allow Jada - THE hyper sexy professional prototype and Max -the hero cabdriver of this flick-, to show their chemistry surfacing through sharp dialogs, gives you the feeling you're not for the conventional thriller plotline/ride.

And this movie is a about that.  The adrenaline rush, the violence, the cool steely demeanor, hired killer - philosophy, are props -aside from highly entertaining.  The peek into the murderer's killings & mind, the steely aesthetics, the beautiful ""smelly"" portrait of a rough L.A., are just supportive of the central human theme.
This movie is about a very common & contemporary human struggle.  Some may say the
most important issue.  Max is a blue collar worker with a dream.  That dream keeps his child spirit alive, and that of most of us striving in the middle.  There is a twist in his perspective: He's not selling his blood for a company.  He's sacrificing his current life to fulfill a dream, of owning a limo service with a unique vision.  He also dreams of island far away, that he keeps a picture of on the cab of.

But conflicting with that is a man with basic needs and fears thereof.  He has bills to pay and people depending on him (his mother).  In twelve years driving a cab he has not been capable of ""taking the dive"", risking his security to pursue his dream.
That dysfunctional fear that naturally lingers in all of us, extends to other areas of his personal life.  He is incapable of risking emotionally, either.
Doing things in which he cannot control the outcome, and pain is at stake.
And he knows it.  Especially evident in the intro segment with Jada, when he's pain and shame are reflected in his face, when he's unable to ask the lady for a second contact, after he knew clearly they hit it off.  He sees her walking away from him, and aches.
He's inertia is leading him to suffering, anyway.
Fox, conveys all that with a few expressions.  Masterful performance, all the way.

Cruise (Vincent) is the devil and also bizarre angel, in his shoulder.  When Vincent's identity is settled for Max, is clear his life is the antithesis of Vincent's.  Vincent lives a life of danger and risks.  No chance to hesitate or blunder.  His payoff is much about for
those risks he takes.
Here Cruise doesn't stick to your head, a much underplayed solid work, where you don't feel as watching someone act.

During the ""ride"" with the devil, Vincent taunts Max's with his evident self- deceit.  Vincent confronts him with a painful outlook.  The future we all dread. A future in which we find ourselves old one day burying the young illusions, with no chance of changing our lives, and dying with remorse for the dead dreams.
That becomes the salt in the wound he needs to awake from his stupor.

Vincent and Max, as in other good guy - bad guy centered screenplays, are similar guys.
Vincent's cool, roll with the punches- improvise on the spot-high level mercenary behavior seem appropriate with his taste of music. One with the appropriate tone: Jazz.
A beautiful, masterfully written and directed piece at a Jazz club, lets us know a side of a cultured Vincent, who knows about Jazz history and understands the craft.  He praises the improvisation quality.  You can sense his love for it.

By the same token, and complemented with Vincent's depiction of his sad childhood, you can suppose that a man with such sensitivity could have a different life. Just as Max.
And deep inside, he knows it.  He despises what he does. Although full of  satisfying (for him) rationalizations for his actions, that he blurts to -of all people- the cab driver, that entertains us fully during the film.  Ethically shallow, but sufficient to appease superficially a man whose life is also shallow.
Both characters seem oppressed by their circumstances, fears and past.  But at the end are paying the price for not exercising their possibility to choose a different path.
Both are escaping reality in very different ways.

Beyond his urgency for someone to take blame of the crimes and his need to focus on the jobs to perform, there are other reasons to stick with Max.  Besides, not showing his face, he shows reasons beyond that for keeping Max, especially when Max starts to show as a liability for the ""project"".  Furthermore, Max's life been a pseudo-living, breathing justification for Vincent's exhilarating line of work, there is a connection that Vincent wants to keep.  One of those, the fact that those hourly connections are the only relations he has with other people.

The movie is the awakening of a man.  That change hints the promise of a new life.  In this ride, not taking risks is not an option. Not, if wants to protect the same security he cherishes.  It's a change or die deal. That awakening is also catalyzed by pride.  He won't sink lower. He won't betray another value, especially not his romantic values.  On top of that he had a night's example of another male, who does whatever is needed to get what he wants.
And finally he acts in 360 degree angle from his regular life.

The ending, which is the only ""traditional Hollywood"" segment that indulges the audience with a happy closure, has been criticized a lot.

I believe that although it insinuates Max's life is going to dramatically improve, you're not left with the certainty.
And it surely reminds us, the flavor of irony we extract from our own life's events.  Arranged like a puzzle only by the protagonist of each life.  With logic that resembles that in Jazz.  And Mann, as a great composer, leaves you with a feeling that this ending had the beautiful consistency of that logic.

Not everything in the plot original: Yes.  Much better played than many other films: Yes",1096329600,4,5843,4.742319127849356
1531212,4,B00005JN2Z,"I saw Collateral in the theater with one of my friends the other night and it's great. People who say this movie is terrible are probably just mad that Tom Cruise is playing the bad guy. Basically, Cruise's character, Vincent, initially appears to be a regular guy who grabs a ride in a cab driven by mild-mannered Max (Jamie Foxx). At one point, Vincent bribes Max to be his normal driver for all of his appointments (with a large sum of money, I might add), and Max reluctantly accepts. After the first destination, however, Max realizes that these appointments are really shooting targets for Vincent, who turns out to be a hit man.

I think the acting in this movie was good for all the actors involved. But I also think people calling Jamie Foxx's portrayal of Max Oscar-worthy are getting a little ahead of themselves. He DID do a good job, but I don't know about an Oscar nod. Also, I couldn't give this movie five stars because it seems like it ended in the wrong place. It should've had one more scene, because I can think of at least two loose ends that were left untied (I can't tell you what those are because they're spoilers of sorts). If I piqued your curiosity, well then, go to the theater and check this movie out.

1531213,5,B00005JN2Z,"With two of my all-time favorite movies directed by Mann (""Heat"" and ""The Insider""), and having Cruise as one of my favorite actors, I couldn't resist the temptation to check out ""Collateral"". And I wasn't dissapointed.

As Mann has us used to, he has you on the edge of your seat all through the movie, with some fantastic dialog and some great directing and photography, something that has made him legendary by now, with his unique treatment of light and shadows. Interestingly enough, the script's credit this time falls in the lap of Stuart Beattie, one of the co-writers for ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", a 'first time' for Mann, who normally writes or adapts the script himself.

As for Cruise and his interaction on the screen with Foxx, it's a perfect match. Cruise: what else can you say about him that has not been said? I guess, the fact that he plays a damn good bad guy! Interesting that he'd be a fourth choice for the role after Rusell Crowe was considered for it, and both, Edward Norton and Colin Farrell, were offered the chance to play Vincent. As for Foxx (""Ali"", ""Any Given Sunday""), he too does a fine job, consolidating him along with Will Smith as the top talent in a solid new generation of african americans following the lead of Denzel Washington.

All in all, one solid blend of tasteful directing, great camerawork, engaging dialogs and acting, and tying it all together in the background, an eclectic soundtrack combining the musical talent of James Newton Howard.",1095552000,3,1493,4.756756756756757
1531214,3,B00005JN2Z,"This movie does a wonderful job in setting locale. It hums with the moody power of Los Angeles.  Before ten minutes have gone by, you will feel as though you are right in LA, practically smelling the summer-hot pavement and feeling lost and small in the yawning, often glossy expanse of the city.  It's the best depiction of a large Western city since Chinatown (LA in a prior age) and Vertigo (San Francisco).

Too bad the movie is not as convincing in developing a plot and a credible central character.  The premise is great: taxi driver unwittingly picks up a hit man, is forced to escort him to and from a string of bloody assignments, and, in the course of the evening, both men learn something about themselves.  The problem is that the movie doesn't fully deliver on this premise.  We never really learn anything very profound about either of the characters and, though the taxi driver does grow and develop a bit as events unfold, the hit man seems even murkier in intent at the end of the film than he did at the beginning.  From a pure plotting perspective, the story disappoints us by hinging the final act on a preposterous coincidence that throws cold water on any suspension of disbelief we had managed to conjure up during the first 90 minutes.  And the action concludes with, of all things, an all-too-familiar-chase through the cars of a subway train in a sequence designed to manufacture tension and wake us up, rather than engage our interest by revealing something really interesting about either or both of these guys.  It's as though the movie first tries to distinguish itself by being a character study and, when that proves itself to be a bit slow-moving on screen, it reverts to being just another action flick.

Performances are mixed.  This is clearly Jamie Foxx's movie.  Surprisingly, he easily steals it from Tom Cruise, who was extremely convincing as a villainous type in Magnolia, but just doesn't manage it here.  He seems to think he can compete with great movie good-guy/bad-guy switch hitters-- like Edward G. Robinson, James Cagney and Anthony Hopkins-- by simply holding a blank stare for most of the film and suppressing his usual toothy grin in favor of a perpetual look of concern.  There's one basic thing wrong with Cruise's performance: he's not menacing.  Oh, he does menacing things but it's fairly obvious that the man doing them is just Tom Cruise trying to be frightening.  Tom Cruise didn't lose Tom Cruise in his character.  So we can't, either.  It will take more than grey hair and wrinkles to convince me he's a killer.",1095033600,3,2576,4.750561797752809

Tom Cruise's character Vincent is a contract killer who uses an innocent Taxi Driver named Max played by Jamie Foxx, to drive him around town as he  kills his victims. Vincent assures Max that these are all ""bad people"" but as the story goes on you realize Vincent can't be trusted with anything he says.

Tom Cruise plays this evil character with alot of depth and complexity. You start to see that he is actually very warped and evil.  Jamie Foxx's character starts to wonder just how psycho this person is and you can tell he realizes this situation is getting worse and worse.

Jada Pinkett Smith plays the Attorney who rides with max before Vincent. She and Max flirt and it creates a very interesting plot twist. Mark Ruffalo plays a detective trying to hunt down the killers of the murder victims. Ruffalo was so good in his role, that at first I didn't even realize it was him.

I could see an Oscar nomination for Tom Cruise with this movie. His character is so complex, and Cruise portrays him with perfection.",1094860800,5,1049,4.588235294117647
1531297,4,B00005JN2Z,"Collateral, the new action-thriller from Michale Mann is more than satisfactory, it's one highly enjoyable ride loaded with thrilling performances from Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx.  Michael Mann of course has crafted many great thrillers incluing Manhunter, Thief and the superb Heat.  Other films he is notable for are The Insider, which earned him his Oscar-nomination, Ali and THe Last of the Mohicans.

  Foxx who steals the movie from Cruise plays Max, a cab driver.  He's worked as one for 12 years and before he picks up Cruise he meets Jada Pinkett Smith's character, who he soons becomes friendly with.  Then we meet Vincent played wonderfully by Cruise, with his salt and pepper hair and shades.  Max soon learns that Cruise is a hitman and that he's in a dangerous situation.  The suspense and tension build up and we reach an exciting and intense climax.  This is probably one of the more enjoyable films of the summer, I mean we've got good action, acting, story and suspense, what more could you ask for.  The movie isn't perfect but it proves to be a great and remarkbly smart and well-crafted thriller.  Possibly worth owning on Video and DVD.

  Collateral is rated R for Violence and Language.  The mayhem includes shootings, stabbings, fights and chases.  THe violence isn't especially bloody, graphic or deafening.  THe action is surprisingly good and there's plenty, but probably not enough to satisfy hardcore action fans.  The language is fair, not constant but a substantial amount.  Overall a great thriller, worth seeing in the theatre.",1094774400,5,1560,4.996108949416342
1531298,4,B00005JN2Z,"Max (Jamie Foxx) has been a ""temporary"" taxi driver for the past 12 years, just waiting for things to ""get in to shape"" as he tries to save enough money to start his own limo-business. He's lonely, he's afraid to commit and he has a sick mother in the hospital. Suddenly, Vincent (Tom Cruise) enters his cab and Max has no option but to drive through the LA night as Vincent, a contract-killer, starts to murder the five witnesses to a narcotics process.

""Collateral"" has its weakest points in the script, with some major holes that can't be overlooked, and in the development of ""the bad guy"", played by Tom Cruise. I mean, Vincent must be the dumbest, worst (yet luckiest) contract killer alive in the world. Not that Cruise isn't good in the movie, he is - at least he shows some effort at trying to be good in a role that is different from everything he has done until today. The movie's strongest points are the excepcional direction by Michael Mann, and Jamie Foxx.

Michael Mann wanted to do a thriller. And he did it, with a capital T. ""Collateral"" has some very strong moments, leaving the viewer tense for most of the time. The script doesn't have logic or continnuity problems (as could have been expected, because the plot spans only twelve hours or so of the same night), but some parts treat the viewer's intelligence with disrespect. Jamie Foxx, strong in comedies, proves to be a very resourceful and convincing actor, carrying most of the weight of the movie on his back. The final 15 or 20 minutes contain a plot-twist that is not unexpected (but not too obvious either) and provide the best moments of the movie. Jada Pinkett also rises above the expected supporting role she's supposed to play.

""Collateral"" is one more above-average movie by Michael Mann, one of the (few) trully innovative directors in today's Hollywood.

1531299,5,B00005JN2Z,"I really enjoyed this film, despite the idea of a hitman taking a cab to his assignments.  I thought Tom Cruise was excellent as Vincent the hitman and thought it was a nice departure from his usual roles.  My daughters thought he was creepy (they are 16 and 13).  I didn't know very much about Jamie Fox but was impressed by his acting and will be willing to see him in Ray(the Ray Charles movie coming out later this year).  The cinemaphotography reminded me of the old miami vice series and I thought it worked well with the story.  The story moved quickly and had humor and seriousness interlaced through it.

I would recommend it strongly",1094515200,5,643,4.5
1531300,5,B00005JN2Z,"Jamie Foxx is astonishing as a taxi driver who seems to have it all together at first and who, after a difficult evening out with hired killer Tom Cruise, discovers that he hasn't been as well adjusted as he's thought.  He's delayed opening his own business with the excuse that he needs more time to conceptualize it until it's ""perfect.""  And he's lonely too, and hasn't had a date in quite a while because he lives in his mind.  Under the most horrifying of circumstances, Foxx's character, Max Durocher, has his whole world collapse around him, and he finds out to his surprise, that it isn't 100% negative thing.  I kept thinking maybe the writers called him ""Durocher"" to remind us of the old time ballplayer Leo Durocher and his famous saying that ""Nice guys finish last.""

Cruise is very good, although he isn't asked to give the acting workout that Jamie Foxx undergoes.  And Jada Pinkett Smith, short as she is, makes interesting acting choices in what could have been a nothing role as the US attorney, Annie, who becomes Max's love interest.  And there are other great actors let loose in this wildly entertaining film, everyone from Irma Hall to Javier Bardem to Mark Ruffalo, who seems to make every other film that's released nowadays but who won't find another one soon with as much topnotch quality and mass appeal.",1094428800,2,1332,4.7155172413793105
1531301,5,B00005JN2Z,"After seeing Micheal Mann's Heat i first saw the preview for this movie and thought, with Tom Cruise in it the movie it could be even better than Heat. I would have to say that Collateral was better than Heat, mostly because of the 1-hour difference in movie time.

I'm not going to go into what happened in the movie because i am sure someone else's review will. If you've never seen a Micheal Mann film, he is very good at using a combination of script and filming to get the viewer to associate themselves with the characters as well as develop them to a point where you don't want to see them die, and when they do it's unexpected and really twists your insides if you allow yourself to be serious about watching the movie.

Everyone is talking about Tom Cruise playing a bad guy, which he did an excellent job doing. His character, Vincent, is a kind of guy that doesn't take crap from anyone and feels no emotion or pity on people he kills, he plays the perfect psychopathic killer with a twist, a comical twist. Just the cab scenes are better then any reality tv show, and all the while the conversations seem realistic.

Jamie Foxx steals the show though. He plays a kind of quiet, shy cab driver who is mentally T-boned by Cruise's character. Foxx seemed to have his life planned out, but it wasn't going anywhere, and Vincent opened his eyes that he wasn't going anywhere fast and his dream of a limo line was not going to happen. Vincent changes Foxx's characters life in both a positive way for his future and a negative way in the present. If you didn't understand that last line, then watch the movie and you'd understand.

This movie was good up till the very end, not the events leading up to the last scene. The best part about the ending is that it is ironic since the irony came out of Cruise's mouth. It was kind of similar to Heat's ending where Pacino is chasing De Niro and they are talking all the way to the end. The end in Collateral is similar, but more intense.

This is easily the best movie of the summer, and Number 1 on my list of movies to own. If you've seen this movie I highly recommend Heat, and vis versa.",1094428800,3,2143,4.334164588528679
1531302,5,B00005JN2Z,"Michael Mann's ""Collateral"" is as an intense, edge-of-your-seat action thriller as you'll find this summer, thanks to Mann's breathless yet elegant directorial style and the cat-and-mouse chemistry between stars Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. Stuart Beattie's screenplay turns the screws on Max Durocher (Foxx), an amiable L.A. cabbie who suddenly finds his cab commandeered by a sociopathic hit man named Vincent (Cruise). Villainy becomes Cruise: he is gleefully charismatic in a role that is as much as possible devoid of redeeming human qualities. And Foxx really makes you feel for Max, a nice guy coasting through life who now must call on long-unused reserves of resourcefulness and cunning, simply to live through the night. There also are an unflappable L.A. cop on Vincent's trail, played by the usually very flappable Mark Ruffalo; a sexy district attorney played by Jada Pinkett Smith; a malevolent drug kingpin played by Javier Bardem; and Max's disapproving mom, played by Irma P. Hall in the movie's sharpest comic relief. The photography by Dion Beebe and Paul Cameron makes a glittering, sprawling deathtrap of Los Angeles, adding immeasurably to the film's slick malevolence.",1093824000,3,1189,5.363636363636363
1531303,5,B00005JN2Z,"About a couple of weeks ago, I went to check out ""Collateral"" at the theater. The film was nothing short of action-packed and intense! The direction of Michael Mann (""Heat"", ""The Insider"") was top-notch and outstanding! With its meditative aerial views of downtown street grids and rich digital-video cinematography that unites sparkle and grime into a kind of seedy nocturnal poetry, ""Collateral"" is one of the best-looking modern noirs that you'll see. It could be a corollary to another modern noir and Mann's best film, the epic crime story ""Heat"" -- a more modest, more arty riff on L.A.'s underside and on the juxtaposition of straight and criminal leads. The performance of Tom Cruise (""The Last Samurai""), offering a change of pace for his role as a ruthless killer, was nothing short of intense! It's impossible to take your eyes off of Cruise for a second! The performance of Jamie Foxx (""Any Given Sunday"") was nothing short of excellent! Joining them are Jada Pinkett Smith (The ""Matrix"" films), Mark Ruffalo (""13 Going on 30""), Peter Berg (""Cop Land""), and Bruce McGill (""Runaway Jury"") in which they gave great performances as well.

The film pairs a fast-talking, hired assassin named Vincent (Cruise) in town for one night with a cabbie named Max (Foxx) on the night shift. Vincent arrives in the city late with orders to knock off five people involved in a drug-trafficking trial set to start the next morning. After being impressed with Max's knowledge of L.A. shortcuts and traffic patterns en route to his first hit, Vincent hires Max to be his driver for the night, securing his services first with a handful of hundred dollar bills and later, when Max knows what Vincent is up to, through threat of violence.

As the cabbie, Jamie Foxx continues his perhaps unlikely rise from sitcom celeb to A-list actor, though it's easy to imagine dozens of other actors inhabiting the same role just as well. Appealing supporting players Mark Ruffalo and Jada Pinkett Smith are fine, if perhaps underused. But the real attraction here is Tom Cruise, and for a director who has worked with such high-wattage actors as Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Russell Crowe, Daniel Day-Lewis, and even William Petersen (who gave an intense, moody performance in Mann's 1986 film, ""Manhunter"", the superior precursor to ""The Silence of the Lambs""), Cruise seems a little too plain -- a little too dull -- for a Mann protagonist. But clearly, Cruise's own image is at work here, with Mann playing off Cruise's unflappable persona and trying to get dramatic mileage by having the actor play against type as a ruthless bad guy. (A scene in a jazz club is a set piece to show off the depths of Vincent's heartlessness and Cruise's bravery.) Cruise's Vincent certainly makes for a compelling visual, his silver hair and gray stubble matching his shiny, shark-colored suit to form the image of a hit man as walking handgun. Cruise is as watchable as ever, but his Vincent is too much the cipher. His line readings are so practice-perfect that Vincent could be as easily be a Cruise hero from any of the actor's other action movies.

In conclusion, ""Collateral"" has the makings of a gritty, action-packed thriller with suspense at every twist and turn. Under the direction of an industry hack like Joel Schumacher or Brett Ratner, ""Collateral"" might have ranged from unwatchable to instantly forgettable. But luckily for us, Michael Mann gives it enough soul and visual verve to make it worth seeing, which is a not-inconsiderable feat. But ultimately, ""Collateral"" might be just another Hollywood star vehicle. Without a doubt, ""Collateral"" is a DVD must-own for your collection!",1093737600,3,3666,4.957723577235773

Here, Jamie Foxx plays Max, a low-achieving Los Angeles cabbie with dreams flogging the PM shift, who picks up Vincent (Cruise), who's just arrived in the city. Ostensibly, as Vincent explains, he's in town to gather overnight five signatures on a real estate deal before flying out the next morning. Vincent offers Max $700 to be his chauffeur for the wee hours before delivering him back to the airport on time. It isn't until Max's first stop, during which a body falls on the windshield of his ride from a fourth story window, that he realizes that perhaps his tip for the gig isn't big enough. Unfortunately, Vincent, with inexorable persuasion, says ""drive on"", after loading the body into the trunk. As the corpses begin to accumulate at various locales around the city, a street smart cop begins to connect the dots, and the chase is on.

During the first two-thirds of the film, Vincent philosophizes about the inescapable presence of politically incorrect Death in the world, and his unremarkable and necessary role as a Grim Reaper. At times, the two men almost seem on the verge of bonding, as when Vincent bails Max out during an over-the-radio dispute with the latter's overbearing boss-dispatcher. And when Max apparently takes Vincent's advice to take the carpe diem thing more seriously than procrastinating his dreams as is his wont. But Max's overriding horror at the night's killing spree wins out.

The last third of COLLATERAL degenerates into a typically Tinseltownish Babe-in-Peril-Saved-in-the Nick-of-Time scenario - something that should be suspected during the first 15 minutes, when Max emotionally connects with a fare,  a smart yet engagingly vulnerable Federal prosecutor (Jada Pinkett Smith) who needs to work late at the office prepping for tomorrow's opening of a big case. Now, while there's nothing wrong with that, and it is a nail-biter, it's not consistent with the refreshingly intelligent scripting of what came before. Thus, I can only award 4 stars for a failure to follow through. I must say, however, that the acting by both Cruise and Foxx is superb, and it's difficult to tell which is the Lead and which the Supporting role.

Finally, I can unequivocally answer ""no"" to the last of Vincent's questions posed to Max. I've sometimes looked pretty dead on the Metro ride to work in the morning, and nobody's noticed.",1093737600,,2624,5.009174311926605

A body falls from the window of the apartment building and onto his cab, right then and there he figures out who Vincent is.  To save himself, he has to do as he is told or risk being killed.  With a sense of humor and suspense, Collateral may be nominated for an oscar for best screenplay, best actor, and best director.

1531395,4,B00005JN2Z,"I admire several of director Michael Mann's earlier works, notably Thief (1981), Heat (1995), Manhunter (1986), The Last of the Mohicans (1992), and Ali (2001). What we have in this film is perhaps the best example of Mann's style: Multiple camera angles, leisurely conversations juxtaposed with high-speed action, ethically and/or morally ambiguous lead (usually male) characters, and music which is seamlessly integrated within an unhurried plot. It is twilight in Los Angeles as Max (Jamie Foxx) carefully prepares his cab for another evening. Two fares of note: a prosecuting attorney named Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith) with whom Max almost immediately develops a mutual attraction and then an-assassin-for-hire named Vincent (Tom Cruise) who retains Max for the entire evening. For the next several hours, Max provides the transportation which Vincent needs to complete a series of five hits for his client, a major drug organization which needs to have four witnesses eliminated. As for the fifth person on the hit list....

As I observed the development of the story line, certain elements in it reminded me of the earlier Mann films but also of Chinatown (1974) , Pulp Fiction (1994), and L.A. Confidential (1997). For example, its noir elements; also its engagement of the viewer to feel like an eavesdropper, if not a voyeur. Almost all of Collateral was shot at night and much of the city revealed may be unfamiliar to those who actually live there. Killing people is what Vincent does. I would rank his skills somewhere between those of Edward Fox's ""Jackal"" and John Travolta's Vincent Vega. It is Foxx (not Cruise), however, who is the film's emotional center of gravity. Mann brilliantly establishes this during Max's conversation with Annie, a cab scene I consider to be at least the equal of Brando and Steiger's in On the Waterfront.

Given all that, why not a higher rating? Good question. In fairness to Mann and his associates as well as to those who read this brief commentary, I want to be very careful when answering that question. I don't reveal too much when suggesting that several situations in this film are distractingly implausible. Mann is a master of portraying gritty realism. In this film, he sometimes wanders across the line into areas more appropriate to, for example, The Matrix (1999) or an earlier Cruise film, Minority Report (2002). Also, I found the film's ending unsatisfying. It gave me the impression that Mann really didn't know quite what to do. (I had exactly the same reaction to the ending of Mike Nichols' The Graduate.) Some films conclude with a clear indication that a sequel is probable. In this instance, that would also be implausible.

Overall, Collateral provides solid entertainment. Although I enjoyed The Bourne Supremacy somewhat more, that's just one man's opinion.  See both and judge for yourself.",1093651200,,2863,5.111111111111111

However, as the antagonist, he performs his role incredibly well.  In fact, all the actors deserve kudos for what was a great series of performances.

Based primarily on dialogue, the screenplay is a good variation on the hit-man genre of cookie cutter movie production.  This movie is different; it has the same basic plot of movies that go back to films like ""Day of the Jackal.""

I say this movie is worth seeing, though it starts off a little slow.",1093564800,,602,4.579439252336448

Why didn't his character simply speak up and say that he was being held hostage bascially by Vincent. Well I figure that his character (forgot his name) the cabbie thought that since Vincent was a professional killer that he could easily take out the two cops and then kill him as well so he lied. That being said I'll be picky again a say that the scene where they are in the jazz club was overly long but effective nontheless in firmly establishing Vincent as a professional and heartless killer. The death of the old jazz artist was unexpected and just plan cold. The scene with the cabbie's mom in the hospital was eerie. Vincent was sort of making it known to the cabbie that he knew where his mother was, someone he deeply cared about in case he was thinking about blowing his cover to the Fez or not cooperating. The way in which LA was filmed was absolutely gorgeous and the soundtrack was jazzy and at times surreal with what was going on in the film. It sorta reminded me of NIGHT AT THE GOLDEN EAGLE.",1093305600,,1155,4.376744186046512

This was neither intelligent (the character development was lengthy *and* flimsy, making the talking-head scenes boring) nor exciting (with the exception of a few sequences near the end).  Most of the plot didn't make sense, the writing was generally dull with only a few good moments, and the contortions that Tom Cruise pulled his face into in attempts to look evil were actually laughable.  More ambitious than a regular action film, but not more intelligent, so the mediocrity just becomes more noticeable.",1093305600,4,648,4.981481481481482
1531399,5,B00005JN2Z,"I sort of thought they didn't make movies as good as this anymore. In a way, Collateral is nostalgic, recalling a time when character development meant more than giving a character a wife with a minor speaking part. In a way, though, too, it's the best kind of modern, with terrific setpieces, editing and action.

Slightly eccentric casting pays off in the case of Cruise and Fox, one easily believable as a suave killer who could pass for a businessman, the other equally believable as an ordinary guy with an acute sense of humor. In the end, I think it's not just that they pull off these performances in spite of themselves; but that Cruise's arrogance helps him to channel Vincent, and that Fox brings out the cab driver's sense of humor as one of his defining characteristics.

The strong performances by the two main characters and the solid, clever script are the main attractions, but also worth noticing is the beautiful photography; it works so well with its urban location, which always seems like more than a backdrop. Then there's a scene in a dance club called Fever which rivals the House of Blue Leaves sequence in Kill Bill for sheer choreography and slickness. There's something about seeing Tom Cruise effortlessly break a man's leg with a stomp kick which alone is worth the price of admission.

Thematically, Collateral is interesting, although Cruise's Philosophical Villain may seem overplayed to those very familiar with such devices. Still, the idea of a doubled character (central to Alfred Hitchcock's work), of moral ambiguity and of a Stockholm Syndrome-like sympathy with Cruise's character, all come off very well. Even at the end, when it seems to degenerate into a simple action picture, the themes are still subtly operating, and are strongest in the last scene.

I'm wondering if this film is destined to become a sleeper hit. Even though critics and audiences seem to love it, it was released with little fanfare in a slow season for movies, and didn't do exceptionally well in the box offices. I would say, though, that it rivals any film like it put out in this decade, and deserves to become a classic in the line of Chinatown and A Touch of Evil.",1093305600,3,2188,4.8111702127659575

Two cops pull him over and instead of jumping out and telling the cops Cruise has a gun and is forcing me to drive him around he lies to the cops. Stupid scene. I love Michael Mann's movie Heat but this one is a turkey. He should have gotten Deniro or Pacino to play the killer instead of Cruise. He cannot be taken serious as a contract killer.

By contrast, Tom Cruise's 'Vincent' is a cipher here.  And rightfully so.  Mann's unwillingness - and Foxx's inability - to penetrate Vincent is crucial to the chill that develops whenever Vincent swings into action.  Cruise is great - never once did I think ""that's Tom Cruise playing Vincent."" Instead, the guy frightened me to death.  So much for the theory that Tom Cruise has to play the hero.  He's about as far from that here as you can get.

Foxx surpasses even that praise.  He's deserves an Academy Award nomination here.  His 10-minute scene with Javier Bardem is just about the finest piece of acting you'll ever see.

If there's any justice in the world Foxx should have a glorious future. The guy has incredible screen presence, it shows in the many scenes where he  interacts with Cruise. Pinkett's character was developed decently for the short time in the beginning we had to see her, I see a decent competition for Beyonce and Halle Barry.

Never mind the odd moment when the plot doesnt compute (for instance, how does one detective suddenly come upon so much information toward the end of the film?). The pacing is so relentlessly intriguing and the visuals so inventively stylish that you'll forget your gripes with the story.

1531491,4,B00005JN2Z,"**Warning: Spoilers ahead**

This movie surprised me. I mean it REALLY surprised me. I didn't know what to expect from this movie. Collateral shows Tom Cruise in what I believe is his first `bad guy' role and Jamie Foxx in one of his few non-comedy roles. But with its tight writing and direction, and great performances by all actors involved, Collateral is without a doubt one of the best movies of this summer, and the surprise sleeper hit of the year.

The story of Collateral revolves around an assassin named Vincent (played by Cruise) who commandeers a taxi operated by Max (played by Foxx). Vincent forces Max at gunpoint to assist him in assassinating five individuals on his hit list. However, this seemingly simple premise belies an incredibly strong story. If you want non-stop balls-to-walls action, and/or have no patience for movies that `have a lot of talking' then look somewhere else. While there are several scenes of gunplay, the core of this movie deals with the interaction between Vincent and Max.

It is true that, like in most movies, Collateral's most interesting character is the villain. Cruise's portrayal of the character is amazing. As Vincent, Cruise delivers his lines with such ease and confidence, that it's more than worthy of Oscar consideration. Vincent is a person who his incredibly calm considering the profession that he's in. He is also extremely resourceful, as shown when he pretends to be a lawyer telling off Max's boss when he (the boss) wants to take any damages done to the taxi out of Max's paycheck. Vincent also always has something sarcastic (and often funny) say to Max when he begins to criticize what Vincent has done. After Vincent kills of the first person on his list, Max asks why he would kill his victim after only just meeting him. To that, Vincent replies, `What? I should only kill people after I get to know them?'. Vincent then asks Max whether he heard about Rwanda. He goes on to tell Max thousands of people died yet `Did you join Amnesty International, Oxfam, Save the Whales, Greenpeace, or something? No. I off one fat Angelino and you throw a hissy fit.'

Max himself is also an interesting character, and is surprisingly well-played by Jamie Foxx. He tells people who get in his cab about his intentions to own a limo service and drive around famous people, yet at the same time he projects a sense that this is more of a dream than a real plan, and you feel sorry for him. His character is also one that continuously changes throughout the movie. After the first killing, Max gets scared and has no idea how to deal with Vincent. But as soon as he sees an opening, Max jumps on the opportunity to destroy Vincent's suitcase with his work inside. And when Max has to confront a powerful drug lord while posing as Vincent, he has to force himself to become as cool and collected as Vincent himself.

An interesting thing to note about this movie is, just like Michael Man's other movie Heat, Collateral likes to use a lot of the wide shots of the background. In Heat this was used to good effect to give that movie a more `epic' experience. In Collateral, this wide shot technique is used to give the viewer to stronger `feel' for the city of Los Angeles, as a bustling, busy, and warm (in terms of temperature) metropolis.

If Cruise and Foxx continue to make performances like that in Collateral, I wouldn't be surprised if one day they get an academy award. Hell it's entirely possible for them to get nominated for their roles in this movie. With so many special effect blockbusters out there this summer, Collateral bucks the trend by providing a movie that focuses on strong characters and dialogue, and a few unexpected twists, rather than relying on huge explosions. Collateral is one of the MUST SEE movies of this summer, so don't deprive yourself by not checking it out.

I give Collateral a rock-solid 8 out of 10!",1092700800,51,3901,4.694444444444445
1531492,4,B00005JN2Z,"My second Tom Cruise movie.  It was a slow movie.  A few intense moments that you will find yourself cursing underneath your breath, and wanting to help Jamie Fox out of his delimia.  I am not one to watch thrillers because I get a little worked up.  The comic relief was great!  L.A. at night was a perfect setting, peaceful yet decietful.

The movie begins with Jamie Fox preparing for a day at work in his PERFECT tidy cab.  He picks up a few wacky people, and then we meet Foxx's love interest.  Things begin to look up for this underdog cab driver.  Then he gets to accomidate Vincent (Cruise), for the evening.  Vincent offers him $700 dollars fare for the rest of the night, which is all fine and dandy until a dead man falls on his cab, while waiting for Vincents return from one of his stops.  Foxx begins to lose his wits after that, (who can blame him).  Then things begin to get personal, involving a scene with Foxx's Mother in the hospital, and several deaths have been reported throughout the city all night.  The comical relief is classic in this movie, and basically saves it.  The ending is almost shocking, but could use one last dose of comical relief.

1531493,3,B00005JN2Z,"Collateral is a movie directed by Michael Mann (Ali, Heat) and starring Tom Cruise (Rain Man) and Jamie Foxx (Any Given Sunday). Looking at both actors' resumes, I've realized that Tom Cruise hasn't played a role of a villain for as long as one can remember. And Jamie Foxx hasn't been recognized before for being a good actor, not even in a supporting role.

I understand that Cruise would want to play the role of a merciless cold blooded killer to expand his acting abilities. But honestly, the role of Vincent does not fit Tom Cruise's character. The role would have been great for someone like Brad Pitt or, for an older generation, Al Pacino. Jamie Foxx does not fit in the entire picture, let alone the role of cab driver Max, a role that would have been perfect for somebody like Samuel Jackson. He delivers his lines like somebody reading off of a cue card. The scenes that are meant to be intense, like the scene when Vincent's first victim comes falling out of the window and onto Max's cab, become vague and dull with Foxx's overacting and the loose dialogue.

Collateral could have been a very good movie if only the director and casting crew would have decided to hire different lead actors.

1531494,5,B00005JN2Z,"A film by Michael Mann

Max (Jamie Foxx) is a Las Angeles cab driver with dreams of something grander for his life.  His dream, as he tells various fares, is to own his own luxury limo company: Island Limos.  This job of driving a taxi is only temporary, but it is a temporary job that has lasted ten years.  Max is a man who does not step out and take risks in his life.  Into this mundane existence comes yet another fare, Vincent (Tom Cruise).  Vincent offers Max $600 if Max would drive him to five different locations so Vincent can do some business and catch a flight out of town at the end of the day.  While this is against his company's regulations, Max accepts.  $600 is a lot of money for one night's worth of work.

When Max brings Vincent to his first stop and a few minutes later a dead body lands on top of Max's taxi, followed by Vincent looking not at all upset or surprised, we know that this evening is taking a turn that Max never anticipated.  Max accuses Vincent of killing the dead guy, but Vincent coldly replies that ""the bullets and the fall killed him.""  Vincent is a hit man, a paid assassin, and despite Max's protests that this isn't his job, Max will drive Vincent around the city as Vincent kills person after person.  He doesn't have a choice, really.  Vincent has a gun.

What is fascinating about this movie is how the relationship between Vincent and Max works.  Despite his chosen profession, Vincent is civil and cultured.  As a character, Vincent comes off as somewhat likeable even though we know he is a bad guy and we have seen him coldly murder.  Yet, there is a certain charm to Vincent, and he treats Max well so long as Max goes along with what Vincent wants.  Vincent suggests that Max will never improve his lot in life until Max himself takes responsibility and does something about it.  There is not a friendship here, but throughout the movie a grudging respect between the two characters build.

This respect does not change the fact that Max is being held hostage while Vincent is committing murder.  The viewer can guess in what direction the film is going by the way director Michael Mann ties things together early on in the movie.  He makes a couple of connections (which would give away part of the ending if mentioned directly) which are obviously not coincidence.  We even learn Vincent's unspoken intent by dialogue said by a detective (Mark Ruffalo) investigating that first murder.  Nothing is truly random in this movie, and this goes double for the ending.  ""Collateral"" is building to this ending, which I felt was fully appropriate, the entire movie and with the exception of a single scene where Vincent becomes the second coming of the T-1000 from ""Terminator 2"", everything in ""Collateral"" works for me.  The city itself is a character, giving setting and tone and depth and a sense of place to the film.  While the story could have taken place anywhere, the movie would have had a different feel to it.

""Collateral"" can be dark and violent, but it is also intelligent and stylish.  This sense of style is not to be confused with the typical Hollywood ""slickness"", but rather it is Michael Mann giving the film its own feel and look that simply ""works"".  The whole film does (excluding that one scene I mentioned), and when put together it is better than its parts, and this includes the fantastic performances by Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx.

1531495,2,B00005JN2Z,"As I was standing in a rather long line stretching a good length of a big city block outside the theater ticket window, in seeing all the usual casually-clad people lined up to purchase movie tickets, I thought to myself: ""Most of these people are probably going to see either 'The Manchurian Candidate' or 'Collateral'"". To be honest, my gut instinct was telling me to purchase a ticket for the former feature. As I reached the ticket window, I inquired to the vendor about a brief synopsis to both films. Upon this vendor's cut-to-the-quick explanation of ""Collateral""'s storyline centering on a kidnapping, hostage situation of sorts, I decided this was the movie I wanted to see, since I thought this type of picture would not disappoint, and deliver a lot of intrigue and physical punch in the process, which these blackmail and espionage style thrillers usually endow upon the viewer. So, after sitting through ""Collateral"" for over two hours, I wished I had gone with my first instinct. Featuring a mostly ill-conceived, slipshod plot, combined with an unbelievable, confusing storyline, ""Collateral"" stumbles out of the gate, trips up throughout most of the picture, and burns and crashes at the end. To make matters worse, it appears that the overall storyline was written and prepared by a bunch of hung-over, illiterate high-schoolers, which explains Jamie Foxx's character's largely incoherent rambling that rolls throughout most of the movie. As for Tom Cruise's character, it seems that the producers tried to make him into a hybrid between two Clint Eastwood heroes: Dirty Harry and The Outlaw Josey Wales. Adding insult to injury, seeing that Cruise wants to be the ultimate S.O.B. tough guy, and just when one thinks a ""Go ahead punk, MAKE MY DAY!""-type moment will sound from Mr. Cruise's lips, he appears both hesitant and tentative in his execution. When the above verbatim becomes affirmative, it is echoed with a trite and forceful resonance that is likely to make one stand up out of their seat and yell: ""Blasphemy! Sheer, heaped to the hilt - BLASPHEMY!"". Seeing that Jamie Foxx is a comedian/comedy actor and not a straight, serious actor doesn't help matters, either. In fact, Foxx's preschool drivel only makes the proceedings excruciatingly worse, leaving himself to wonder what a castastrophic mess he had gotten himself into. Jada Pinkett Smith's appearance is by far the best of the three main actors here, all the moreso making laughingstocks out of both Cruise's and Foxx's subpar performances singlehandedly. With such a high-profile, superstar cast and a supposedly high-octane, fast-paced plot, I thought forking over my hard-earned cash in exchange for a thin, glossy cardboard paper ticket stub as a permanent sort of 'temporary' ""Collateral"", would yield a nice return to satisfy my entertainment pleasure. I also thought I'd be ""investing"" in some big time dividends as a result. As it turned out, I was taken in by a big publicity sham, and received merely a peanut from my so-called ""investment"". It is wise not to waste your precious time or money giving any ounce of attention to a film that truly doesn't deserve it. Avoid forking over any type of ""Collateral"" for this dreck at all costs, and view another feature instead. Definitely not recommended.",1092614400,8,3297,5.07366482504604
1531496,5,B00005JN2Z,"It started out like any other night. Cab driver Max (Foxx) picks up Vincent (Cruise) who tells him that he has a few stops to make, and offers him $600 to get him to agree. When a body falls out of the first stop and lands on his cab, Max realizes he is in for more than he bargained for. As it turns out, Vincent is a killer for hire who has arrived in Los Angeles to wipe out five people that are causing some trouble for his employer. Max has just become his personal chauffeur for the evening. Vincent's domineering, confident attitude is enough for the most part to keep Max in line. Gradually dragging Max into the ""action"" also serves to make Max an accomplice of sorts. Vincent also serves as a mentor of sorts, telling him that he needs to get off his butt and take action in his life. In the end, this could be Vincent's downfall, if Max can get it together and make a stand.

I was pleasantly surprised by ""Collateral"". While not action-heavy, the action scenes are very effective. The more pervasive interactions between Max and Vincent are gripping at times, as a strange relationship forms between the two. Cruise's Vincent is a bit of a departure for him, but he fills Vincent's shoes convincingly. Foxx as Max is equally effective as his character gradually develops some strength of character.

This is not your typical action movie, but if you like a some thought in your movies, you will not be disappointed. This is a gem in the doldrums of the August box office. Check it out.",1092614400,,1497,4.45985401459854

Is this the best film ever made?  No, not by a longshot.  But it does display the things that great movies have- things that are mostly lacking from the lackluster efforts most producers subject us to these days.  Instead of giving us a bunch of special effects for no reason, this film chooses to give us characters we can sink our teeth into with an intense setting and premise we have not seen often.

Jamie Foxx plays a cab driver whose ""part time"" job behind the wheel has lasted 12 years.  After giving a ride to a beautiful lady, he gets a new fare, a man named Vincent (Tom Cruise) who basically hires him for the night to drive him around town for 600 dollars.  As you probably know by now, the stops are for kills, as Vincent is a contract killer.  The internal struggle for Foxx is how to deal with this situation as well as the other problems that arise.  Director Michael Mann once again chooses a great cast to carry his film.  Both Cruise and Foxx are splendid.  They are complex characters, as we learn much about each of them during the course of the film.  The storyline is really nothing special.

But it doesn't have to be.  The mistake directors and producers make these days is to focus on the plot of the movie instead of the characters and their development.  This leads to wooden dialogue and people we can't wait to get away from.  Alfred Hitchcock always said that too many filmmakers focused on the ""MacGuffin"" instead of the characters (Hitchcock defined this as that part of the plot that all the characters are trying to solve, but the audience doesn't care in the least) and that is usually the case.  Great films are always great because of the characters and their development.  This is a film which understands that and is not only very intense, but truly enjoyable.  I highly recommend this movie.",1092528000,2,1984,4.4735376044568245
1531498,4,B00005JN2Z,"""Hey Max..., A guy gets on the MTA here in L.A. and dies. Think anyone will notice?""  - Vincent's time runs out in ""Collateral""

From Michael Mann, the director of ""Heat"" and the creator of ""Miami Vice"" (when the hell is that series coming to DVD?!), comes ""Collateral"", a taut, suspenseful crime drama that is one of the best films of the summer of 2004, and has outstanding performances from both Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx (this isn't your mom's Tom Cruise!).

Tom Cruise is Vincent, a cold-blooded hitman who has just arrived in L.A., with 10 hrs. to kill.

Jamie Foxx is Max, an L.A. cabdriver who works the night shift for the past 12 years in hopes of one day fulfilling his dream of owning his own island cab company.

After Max hooks up with an attractive D.A. (potrayed Jada Pinkett Smith) & getting her phone number, he meets his next customer, Vincent, and Max's hellish nightmare begins.

Vincent offers six hundred bucks to Max, in return for taking him around the Los Angeles area to meet some friends that Vincent has to see. Max soon finds out, the hard way, that Vincent is a hired assasin, & not only in town with time to kill, but, the friends he mentioned are federal witnesses, to a high profile case, that Vincent must, one-by-one like the Grim Reaper, assasinate. The plot thickens when Max finds out the D.A., he met earlier in the evening, is on Vincent's list.

With the police and the F.B.I. hot on the trail, & the clock ticking down to the early morning dawn, Max is forced to find a way to stop Vincent, save the girl, and not become public enemy number one in the eyes of the cops & the feds. Time is not on Max's side.

What makes the film tick is the great performances from the two principles.

Cruise gives one of his best performances of late and I have a feeling that if the Academy remembers ""Collateral"", Cruise might garner another Oscar nomination. Cruise's Vincent is one mean mother f**k in this film and comes across cool, calculative, cynical, and cocky. All the elements found in a great villian. The problem for me was, that he isn't one of those villians you love to hate. I actually liked Vincent!

Foxx gives his best performance to date as Max. Foxx's Max is the typical everyman who passes the hero test by facing a great fear and rising above it all.

The third character in the film is Los Angeles itself. Michael Mann directing the film using digital filmaking technology gives the city an errie sheen that regular film can't quite capture (in one scene while Vincent is walking to one of his destination's in the background the city nightline generates an errie twinkling, while in another Max driving on the freeway toward the nightclub, one can't help but watch the nightsky as the streetlights zoom by). Mann does a great job at generating, and keeping the flow of the action going thruout ""Collateral"" (I didn't find that the film had any real drag to it).

""Collateral"", like Los Angeles, is cold, hard, & full of action. Definitely not to be missed.",1092528000,,3011,4.555555555555555

It is a two-hour adrenaline rush from start to finish, filled with gritty action, and outstanding performances. I kid you not, from the minute Tom Cruise gets into the cab, the movie never slows down!!

This movie is going to set Jamie Foxx up for a whole bunch of great roles in the future and along with the biography of the late-great Ray Charles he is set to star in later this year, this will be a huge year for him.

The Plot: Some of the plot might be a little hard to understand at first, so let me iron it out for you. The movie is about a contract killer (Cruise), who forces a cabbie (Foxx) to drive him around as he commits his series of murders. The hits that he has to make are witnesses in a drug case where Cruise's boss (played flawlessly by Javier Bardem) is the one on trial.

The intensity and energy of the movie will keep you in tune to it throughout and the last 20 minutes will have you on the edge of your seat!!!

This movie is not getting hundreds of good reviews for nothing!! If you want to actually get your money's worth and have fun at the movies definitely go see ""Collateral.""",1092528000,5,1205,4.226086956521739

But then the movie hints that 'Vincent' may have intended to frame the driver for the murders after and make it look like a mass murder/suicide. Except it would've been pretty obvious that the murder victims were all linked and the taxi driver wouldn't have had the knowledge or motive to go around killing them.

Anyways, an entertaining movie. Tom Cruise is great. And I was looking forward to watching Jamie Foxx. I was half expecting him to start singing at some point in the movie ""Oh I'ma man of many wishes I hope my preminition misses"". Those of you who watch the Jamie Foxx show will know what I'm talking about. Nice to see him in a serious role.

Usually, I don't particularly care for movies where the entire movie only spans a small amount of time. And this movie all occurs in a few hours of one night. But this movie was okay. Vincent was indeed an interesting character. I just have a final thought:

However, after the body of the first target falls onto Max's cab, Vincent kidnaps him and forces him to help him out or die defying him.

The actors were both very good at portraying their characters, but it was the movie's score and camerawork that made it truly effective.  The music playing in the background was very good at either complimenting a certain scene, or providing a good contrary to the situation.  For example, while we are waiting for Vincent to kill his first victim, Max is listening to classical music, and it continues all the way until the body lands on the cab.  Also, the movie was shot in a ""home movie"" style, meaning that it was very unsteady and moved with the action.

Sadly, the only major twist is easily guessed five minutes into the film, but the movie is still enjoyable.  While not the greatest movie I've ever seen, this is definitely the best I've seen in a while.",1092441600,5,1543,4.334494773519164
1531600,5,B00005JN2Z,"From my point of view, the premise seemed to be very repetitive and potentially boring, but that all changed on August 12, when I went to see this on a rainy day. Don't get me wrong - the plot does involve five murders by hitman Tom Cruise, playing Vincent, who is driven around by Jamie Foxx, playing Max, but there is a lot more to it than that.

The dialogue is outstanding. Foxx, brilliantly cast, is funny at times, but he doesn't come off as trying too hard to be funny, which is what Will Smith is often guilty of. Cruise, playing a villain for once, shows his dark side and turns in a more than convincing performance. This movie, like other Michael Mann movies, relies on good dialogue. There are extended scenes of just talking, but they are so well-written that you don't even notice. A lesser director would have deleted scenes in favor of the more action-packed ones. Now, there is a lot of action and violence, but it never really gets carried away, and it never is without a point. Vincent tries to convince Max that what he is doing isn't all bad, even though it is murder. This is crucial because it shows the character development.

Also of note, the scenery and cinematography of South Central Los Angeles is beautiful. The more violent scenes are incredibly real, on the same level of being real that Saving Private Ryan was on. It may have just been because I was in a theater, but the gunshots sounded real, and the way Tom Cruise handled himself as a marksman made him look like a real hitman. That's something that you can't train for. You either have it or you don't.

And, there were cops in this movie that were chasing after the cab, but only for a very brief part of the movie, so that it didn't end up being like another one of those cat and mouse movies that I grow quite tired of. Yet, at the same time, there still are lot of thrilling action sequences. This truly is one of the best movies that I ever saw.",1092441600,52,1940,4.368421052631579
1531601,5,B00005JN2Z,"A couple days ago was I amazed by this movie. Gone was Tom Cruise's impish glint in the eye and dazzling smile replaced by  Vincent's  personality that would make an ice cube shudder. Reading the other reviews I was really disappointed at how  too many of them described what the move was about rather than making comments about the actual characters such as Vincent's matter of fact dark  humor over victim number one falling on Max's cab: ""I didn't push him. I shot him. The bullet killed him not the fall"" or the subtle change in Max who was forced to pass as the never before seen Vincent to that man in Club Fever to the point of being as cold and challenging while inside he was shaking in his boots hoping no one would suspect his true identity and eliminate him. I found the woman Prosecuter to be nothing more than the usual stereotypical whiney character. God forbid we should have a woman Prosecutor who could be beautiful and Inferiority Complex free. The best twist was the final scene on the train when Max and Vincent emptied their guns through that glass door. His clip dropping to the floor I thought Vincent  was going to reload. Instead we see he and Max staring at each other guns drawn with the only blood visible on either being from the cab accident. For several seconds do you wonder if both really missed at such close range. Not until Vincent sits do you realize he's fatally shot in the chest. Tom Cruse played Vincent so deliciously evil that I actually felt bad for him and my mind can't stop wondering the same thing he did in how long would it take before anyone noticed a dead man on the train. I had  such an outstanding 'cruise' with Mr. Tom Cruise that I'll have to seem him in more movies.",1092441600,2,1725,4.425867507886435

Tom Cruise as a bad guy is great-he always plays the hero and this was a turn for the better.  The direction was great and the ending is perfect.",1092355200,,455,4.078651685393258

Enter Cruise, a hired killer with five stops to make.  He pays Foxx $600 to drive him exclusively for the night.  Cruise doesn't finish his first hit without the body dropping onto Foxx's polished cab, parked in an alley.  Cruise then forces Foxx to place the body of his victim in the trunk of the cab and continue driving.  Both men attempt to get into the other's head, but Foxx is clearly out of his league, as Cruise taunts him between kills.

After a messy hit at a local nightclub, in which the FBI finally gets wise to the slaughter of important witnesses to their federal case, Foxx becomes increasingly desperate and more involved.  With each murder he tries ever harder to stop Cruise's killing machine.  But it is not until the plot comes full circle and Foxx learns that Cruise plans to kill the prosecutor, the lovely Ms. Jada Pinkett, that he is able to achieve anything meaningful and final.

A low key performance for Cruise.  He's the bad guy and takes up 99% of the screen time.  Not the best film out there, but certainly worth a l",1092355200,2,1253,4.451754385964913
1531604,5,B00005JN2Z,"Michael Mann is at the top of his game.  This riveting thriller combines nicely etched characters, sharp and pointed dialogue, explosive action and violence, delivered with the intelligence, wit and intensity Mann brilliantly brings to the genre.  Like Tarantino, Michael Mann knows when the extreme closeup of his actors faces is all that is required to reveal character and mood and that cross-cutting this intimacy with superbly choreographed violence creates atmosphere and tension lacking from the films of their less-gifted bretheren.

The film just plain looks great.  Michael Mann captures the nighttime streets of LA in as mesmerizing a way as his daytime shootout on those same streets in Heat was simply un-toppable.  Beyond the look, the choices of locales, and the mood and pace of the film are spot-on.

Tom Cruise is terrific in this role and is matched all the way by Jamie Foxx.  It is basically a two character drama, so the two leads had to carry their weight and they did so admirably.  I had no trouble accepting ""pretty-boy"" Cruise as a ruthless, coldly calculating, remorseless and relentless contract killer.  It is a very nice piece of work.  Jamie Foxx has the more difficult ""straight-man"" role, and he acquits himself well.

The production is meticulous.  The supporting cast, down to the smallest role, is perfect, with Jada Pinkett Smith and Mark Ruffalo carrying the largest support, but also fine cameos by Javier Bardham and others.

This is class work by a fine director, cast and crew.  The 5 stars are, of course, for fans of thrillers.  The story may be a stretch with a bit of a hole here and there, the climax almost Terminator-like in relentlessness, but you will be hard pressed to find a more intense or better thriller anywhere.

What I liked about this is that it is different from most thrillers.  It doesn't use the same tired tricks that other thrillers seem to use.  (when someone appears dead, he is dead).

Tom Cruise is actually at his best when playing a villain just like in Interview with the Vampire. Vincent is a ruthless and heartless killer and no one could play him better than Cruise. Although people are just saying now, ""look at Jamie Foxx he can act"". I knew for awhile that he could. Infact he should've been nominated for Ali. He's great in this too as this nice guy who hates this violent situation he's caught up in. He's funny but is also really good at being a sensitive and soft spoken actor as well.

  Also good in supporting roles are Mark Ruffalo (13 Going on 30) as a cop who stumbles on to one of Vincent's crime scenes. Jada Pinkett Smith has good chemestry with Foxx eventhough they only have small scenes together. She plays a lawyer that Max picks up one day and they get along so well that she gives him her business card so he can call her. Collateral is suspenseful and has lots of violence but just like in Mann's Heat these 2 totally opposite guys interact and talk and get to know each other.

And as a New Yorker, I can tell you that the chance of getting an English-speaking cabbie is rare, as well as a clean cab, along with a nice driver. In a totally braindead movie, the only good thing about this movie is that it ends. I looked at my watch several times, as well as 2 trips to the restrooms. I almost fell asleep.

The plot line is fairly straight forward: hired assassin (Tom Cruise in a role that comes close to his fine acting turn in A FEW GOOD MEN, which is praise indeed) engages a good guy cabbie (Jamie Foxx in an outstanding performance! - watch the nominations....) to privately transport him around Los Angeles for six night hours while he murders witnesses to a trial.  More than that you need not know: the movie is basically a duet for these two actors with excellent support form incidental players the likes of Mark Ruffalo, Jada Pinkett Smith, and the always fascinatingly gifted Javier Bardem, etc.  The camera work takes us places Los Angeles hides under smog during the day, skylines at night so magnificent you'd think they were New York.  But then there is also the grit, the smarmy side of all sectors of LA, and Mann and his cinematographer capture it all with relish.  The accompanying musical score is apropos and builds tension.  But in the end it is the tour de force of the interaction between Foxx and Cruise that makes this movie more than just another summer action flick.

1531701,5,B00005JN2Z,"""Collateral"" is brilliant! This is Tom Cruise's best movie and performance of his career, and is also Jamie Foxx's best movie and performance of his career. Michael Mann's direction is brilliant and this is his best movie ever since ""Heat"" (1995). Tom Cruise plays Vincent and Jamie Foxx plays Max, whose lives are changed in just one night. Vincent is an assassin hired to kill 5 witnesses in one night and he pays Max $600 to drive him around to the places he needs to go to and an extra $100 to bring him to the airport. Tom Cruise has never done a character like this, until now, and I still like him, because he is a likable guy and has played likable characters. It was a challenge for me to decide, whether or not, that I liked Vincent, but I did, though, even if, he is a bad guy, in some senses of the word ""bad"". Rounding out the cast is Jada Pinkett Smith as Annie, one of the 5 witnesses that Vincent has been hired to kill, Mark Ruffalo as Fanning & Peter Berg as Richard Weidner, two cops who are involved in the case. Bruce McGill as Pedrosa, An FBI agent who is also involved in the case. Irma P. Hall as Ida, Max's mother, & Barry Shabaka Henley as Daniel, another one of the 5 witnesses that Vincent has been hired to kill. They are excellent and well motivated. Stuart Beattie's story and screenplay is brilliant and well written and also well crafted. The music by James Newton Howard is excellent and well synthesized. There is also additional music by Antonio Pinto, Tom Rothrock & Zachary Koretz, which is also excellent and well synthesized. The cinematography by Dion Beebe & Paul Cameron is brilliant and well shot. 80% of the film was shot on digital video, which makes it looks better. The film editing by Jim Miller & Paul Rubell is excellent. The casting by Francine Maisler is excellent. The production design by David Wasco (who production designed ""Kill Bill Volume 1"" (2003) & ""Kill Bill Volume 2"" (2004) is brilliant and well designed. The art direction by Daniel T. Dorrance is brilliant and well crafted. The set decoration by Sandy Reynolds-Wasco (who decorated the sets for ""Kill Bill Volume 1"" (2003) & ""Kill Bill Volume 2"" (2004) is brilliant and well decorated. The costume design by Jeffrey Kurland (who designed the costumes recently this year for ""Hidalgo"" (2004) is excellent. The hair and make-up on Tom Cruise's Vincent is brilliant and at times, you can't hardly recognize that it is Tom Cruise. This is a well crafted and well made movie with Oscar written all over it.

Foxx did a great job (and that whole scene from the trailer was great), and this was the best I've seen Tom Cruise.

1531703,5,B00005JN2Z,"Michael Mann is one of those directors where you either love him or you hate him. There's something about his films, something that catches the certain spirit or aspect of a time period or a culture, or even a city. In 'Manhunter', Mann follows Will Graham in an 80's fused film loaded with a memorable, hand picked soundtrack with the likes of Prime Movers or Iron Butterfly. His work on 'Heat' and 'The Insider' both gave this eerie, yet calm outlook on violence and the media, respectively. In comparison, Mann's work is like waking up from an afternoon nap and seeing every color in infinite detail, it's like you never looked at it that way before. There's nothing different here in his new masterpiece, 'Collateral.'

First off, this review isn't bias because Tom Cruise is my favorite actor, in fact, it's more critical. As far as I'm concerned, this was a film for Tom Cruise to finally have a title character other than Lestat or Jerry Maguire. You remember Cruise in every film, but there is acting and being a different character altogether. In 'Collateral', those in the realm of film will know his character, Vincent.

Vincent is the type of guy at the airport you glance at and that's it. In a way, he blends, but if you looked even closer, you'd notice how much different he is. Vincent is a contracted killer and he's very, very good at it. In fact, this is his life. So take him, throw him in LA, add a hit list, and a cabbie named Max(Foxx), and you have one hell of a ride, literally.

As in any Mann film, the acting and realism is top notch. Much like his work on 'Heat', real cops and detectives were used, including Cruise and Foxx's own stunts, to add to the integrity of the film. Add this with the well produced use of camera work, something which failed miserably in 'The Bourne Supremacy', and the film really works. I haven't felt so involved with a film in a long while. By the end of the film, you really take in a scope of LA and the backstreets and really grab the feel of the area. I was surprised where I was by the end, no joke.

Cruise and Foxx work brilliantly. I'm glad Sandler didn't fill Foxx's role, as the film would have taken a slight turn, maybe for the worse, maybe for the best, I don't know. What I do know, is that this combination works, and it shows. I hope come Oscar's, this film doesn't take the backseat. Both Foxx and Cruise give astonishing peformances. As do Mark Ruffalo, of whom makes a minor role, and the breathtaking Jada Pinkett Smith, who I find to be one of Hollywood's attractive and better actresses.

With use of Audioslave's song, I really felt for this film. I was glad The Roots also took a part in the beginning, and I also loved the instrumental scores. I would even buy the soundtrack, it's really great, but this is no surprise, given it's a Michael Mann film. Everything went really well and I never felt the soundtrack aspired to be what the film wasn't.

The film, at least for me, works very well. It's never too choppy, the shots are fantastic, the story works well, and the dialogue is terrific. There are even a few laughs in here. Everything blends well and I think it's all to owe to the amazing cast, beautiful direction, and the simplistic but well produced screenplay by Stuart Beattie. I'd say this is the summer's best so far. I cannot wait for this to arrive on DVD and furthermore, might even see it again. I haven't really read too many reviews here yet, but so far it seems people tend to agree.

Go for it.

Even Tom Cruise agrees with that.",1091923200,2,3537,4.439137134052388
1531704,4,B00005JN2Z,"Tom Cruise plays Vincent, a sociopathic hit man, in ""Collateral,"" Michael Mann's new thriller.  Vincent offers a cabbie named Max six hundred dollars to drive him around Los Angeles for the night.  Max soon regrets allowing this wacko into his taxi.

The best part of ""Collateral"" is the chemistry between Vincent, played chillingly by a gray-haired, steely-eyed Cruise, and Max, winningly portrayed as a likeable everyman by Jamie Foxx.  Cruise has flown into Los Angeles to wipe out five individuals who play key roles in a drug case, and he plans to fly out the next morning.  Whether he likes it or not, Max becomes Cruise's wheelman.  In between hits, the two men get into philosophical discussions about such topics as man's place in the universe, the challenges of making a living, and their relationship with their parents.  These sidebars are terrific and for a few fleeting moments, Cruise emerges as a human being instead of just a robotic killing machine.

The other reason to see ""Collateral"" is the magnificent cinematography by Dion Beebe and Paul Cameron.  Los Angeles is photographed as a glittering beauty with a cold and forbidding personality.  Vincent's and Max's isolation from the rest of humanity is symbolized by this city where, as Vincent points out, a dead man can ride on the subway for hours without anyone noticing.

As for the rest of the movie, put your brain on hold.  The plot is filled with enormous holes that demand a huge suspension of disbelief, and there is a hectic chase scene that is simply absurd.  However, in spite of its obvious flaws, ""Collateral"" is worth seeing.  It is a funny, quirky, and off-the-wall buddy movie with a twist.",1091923200,4,1680,4.890459363957597
1531705,5,B00005JN2Z,"Collateral is my favorite film of the summer and my second favorite of the year, only to Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind. Michael Mann, who already gave us the crime classic Heat, delivers another crime classic in the form of Collateral, a film about a taxi driver who is forced to drive a hitman around town as he goes from hit to hit. For the people who were nervous about Tom Cruise being able to pull the role of the villian off, relax: This is the best performance of Cruise's illustrious career. I loved him in Jerry Maguire, thought he ws amazing in Born on The Fourth of July, saw his greatness in Magnolia, and still think Rain Man holds the most underated performance of his career, as well as his second best after this. From the moment we see Cruise walking through LAX Airport, he takes hold of the film and the audience with his gripping intensity, his sarcastic quips, scariness and mean streak. This is one of the best movie villians of all time, right there with Denzel in Training Day and Hopkins as Hannibal. He pulls off that likability factor with the audience, even as he does many horrendous things. In fact, his character is as charming in some scenes as a Jerry Maguire. The movie is worth a look for his performance alone.

However, Jamie Foxx is just as good as the good natured cab driver who Cruise forces into this predicament. It is Foxx's best  performance as well, as he also takes hold of the audience as the protagonist, a cab driver too scared to chase his dreams, but still someone who cares and takes pride in his work, even if nobody notices him or respects him. He has his own set of morals and is a very nice character, and it was great to see him change as the film went along and he had to adapt to different scenarios.

The resr of the cast did their job beautifully as well, especially standouts Mark Ruffalo, Jada Pinkett-Smith and Irma P. Hall. The score was briliiant, as were the song selections. The editing was great, and the script by Stuart Beattie was top notch. Michael Mann does what might be his best work as a director, outside of The Insider, as he shot the film with a digital camera, that helps make the city of LA an integral character in the film. The movie is a little over two hours, but it is so fast paced you don't notice and you don't want it to end. The ending. much like Training Day, takes away from the film a bit, as it seems a little different from the rest of the film, but that is a minor complaint that the movie manages to overcome because of the greatness the movie achieves before that. I love this movie and will be hardpressed to find too many more movies that will be better than this one.",1091923200,8,2679,4.364729458917836
1531706,5,B00005JN2Z,"This movie embodies all the elements that a good film should; comedy, action, consisancy, intensity, good direction, and good acting. I am not generally a Tom Cruise fan, but I really enjoyed this film.

Cruise is a hitman who has one night to hit all five of the targets on his list. He enlists the help of a cab driver (Jamie Foxx) to take him from hit to hit.

Cruise and Foxx have a wonderfully magnetic on screen chemistry. This movie is not in the least serious when dealing with life and death themes. You may even find yourself cheering for the next hit on Cruise's list. Laughing throughout the film is inevitable, although at the same time its intensity draws in the audience.  If you're looking for a fun filled night of intense action and unrelenting comedy, Collateral is not to be passed up.",1091923200,3,805,4.537931034482758
1531707,5,B00005JN2Z,"Michael Mann's latest is one of the best films I've seen this year, so far. From start to finish, Mann's direction doesn't miss a beat and for a two-hour long film, his pacing remains consistent. I never looked at my watch to see how long I've been in the theater from the moment the film began. Even in The Return of the King I glanced down at my watch once or twice.

When it was first announced that Tom Cruise will be starring in Collateral many thought right away that he will be the good guy character. It was quite a surprise to most once they heard that he was going to be the villain instead. Even the announcement that Jamie Foxx was cast in the good guy role instead didn't do much to lessen the impact of Cruise being cast as the heavy. Whatever reservations people might have had about Tom Cruise pulling off being a villain in a film should stop worrying.

Tom Cruise pulls it off and I must say that this has to be the best work he's done since Magnolia. That's how good Cruise was in Collateral. His portrayal of the assassin Vincent is excellent. I always thought that just beneath the veneer of Cruise's million-dollar megawatt smile existed a darker side. Cruise lets this darker side of his personality come out and shine from beginning to end. His Vincent was calm, collected, charismatic and most of all sociopathic. His character was indifferent as to whether what he was committing was good or bad. Or whether the reasoning behind it was right or wrong. Vincent was indifference personafied. To him it all boils down to the job he had to perform. It was just something he was well-adept and well-versed in performing. Like how Jamie Foxx's character Max was good in how he drove a taxicab.

Speaking of Jamie Foxx, he held his own in every scene that he had with Cruise. His Max character represented the Everyman and his work in this film shows just how underrated and underappreciated a dramatic actor he's become. His reactions to the events that unfolded once he took Vincent's fare seems genuine. He reacted like how most people would probably react when they find out that an assassin has now become their bosom buddy for the night. There's real chemistry between Cruise and Foxx. It is this chemistry that holds the film together from start to finish.

Collateral was not so much an excellent crime-thriller, but a study of the missed oppurtunities people have in their lives. OF people not living up to their dreams. Always putting off their dreams until the right time came along. Until one day they've realized that their dream has passed them by and that they've become just one of the millions who end up going through life anonymous and forgotten. Vincent lives every day as if it might be his last, but at the same time he's still fears of becoming one of those anonymous millions. His fear is ironic for the reason that his chosen profession he has chosen to remain anonymous if he is to survive. Max on the other hand spends the entire film going through a forced self-discovery of what he's done with his life and dreams. As an audience we're there to see Max go through this journey of self-discovery from beginning to end.

For filmgoers who'll be going in to see Collateral hoping to see some action and violence won't be disappointed. There's violence in this film. When it arrives its sudden, quick and brutal. The violence in this film was very similar to the way the swordfighting in Takeshi Kitano's Zatoichi: The Blind Swordsman was handled. There's no slow-motion gimmicks or overextended shoot outs. When a gun was pulled out and used there was a reasoning to it. This film had no extraneous scenes of violence for the sake of having it onscreen.

Overall, Michael Mann's film was an great example of how a thriller can be made intelligently and without using tricks, gimmicks and misdirection. Collateral could've been just about two guys talking inside a cab and it probably still have succeeded. Its refreshing to know that great direction, great acting, and a flawless script could still be found in Hollywood to create an excellent film.",1091923200,5,4094,4.663434903047092
1531708,4,B00005JN2Z,"Every action film has its implausibilities.  I would say that is a given.  In real life, there aren't intense multi-car high way chases, there aren't stylized shoot-outs as graceful as a feather's descent from atop a building.  The wonder of cinema is that it is allowed to play with our imaginations until we burst with an excitement experienced only within the shadows of the theater.

There are a mere few minor instances in 'Collateral' where we are forced to think, ""Hm, that's not entirely possible...but who really cares?""  None ruin any of director Michael Mann's credibility.  Consider a shoot-out within a bustling techno dance club.  Tom Cruise as Vincent, a dangerously apathetic and charismatic hit man, manages to hit every one of his targets perfectly without once injuring or killing a single innocent person.  Would this perfectly carried-out plan, not once messy or accidental, exist in reality?  Probably not.  But the benefit I find in minor realism issues in action flicks is that it allows us to be in another place where our hearts can pound as we witness the chilling accuracy of a man who already haunts with no more than a glance reminiscent of a fox.

Tom Cruise portrays this Vincent surprisingly well.  He is a character I've never seen Cruise tackle.  I have to say, I found that refreshing.  Walking into the theater, I was afraid I'd see his ""pretty boy"" persona, but with a grey wig rather than the usual black.  Fortunately, I was proven wrong.  While not quite as Oscar-worthy as many people had hoped, Cruise amazes and enthralls with a cunningly crafted personality and wolf-like humanity.  Killing is his nature.  Cruise manages to make us believe he thinks of humans as stars: there are so many that the death of one couldn't possibly matter.  I loved when he compared the death of one man to a massacre in Rwanda.  The screenplay really provokes solid thought often absent in many thrillers thrown at us these days.

Playing off of Cruise's wonderful performance is Jamie Foxx as Max, a mild and passive L.A. cab driver who picks up Vincent by chance after dropping off Annie Farrel (Jada Pinkett Smith), a woman he could have a date with if he weren't so self-contained.  Though not quite as interesting as Vincent, Foxx's Max is truly human; we want him to survive Vincent and his job to assassinate five witnesses in a current case.  Pinkett Smith's tenderness only elevates the human part of 'Collateral.'  Toward the end, Smith and Foxx together enhance the excitement as we hope and wish they avoid every obstacle they come across.

The city of Los Angeles also plays a role in the film, thanks to gorgeously appropriate digital cinematography that captures the night life and the eerie silence of a city when all but a few have sunken into dreams.  Mann lends a hand in combining the city and character study going on within the cab.  The climax is swiftly followed and executed, only underscoring his skill as a director.  In fact, this is probably his best work since 'The Insider.'  His flawless direction alone was worth the price of admission.  But what I found missing in this piece was more of an emotional foundation.

Though there is obvious connection between Vincent and Max (the effects of which are geniously and interestingly scattered in between the hits), sometimes the cop story lagged on a bit in places where the criss-cross of personality could have been elaborated upon.  'Collateral' is not a perfect film.  But then again, what is these days?  It still manages to get your heart racing.  As the credits role, you feel utterly satisfied, a feeling rare among modern cinema.",1091836800,4,3642,4.8381877022653725
1531798,4,B00005JN2Z,"MOVIE: Do you know what you're doing right now? Do you know where you're gonna be in 10 minutes, 10 months, 10 years? Do you live in the past, present, or future? This is the focus of Michael Mann's new suspense drama. A taxi cab driver named Max tries to focus on where he's headed rather than where he is right now, which is a dead end job driving a taxi. In the blink of an eye his life becomes a toy. A contract killer chooses his cab out of the 4,000 cabs in L.A County. Now Max is involved in something he doesn't want. He immediately has gone from living in the future (thinking of how one day he's going to make it big) to living in the present (thinking of how he will survive till daylight). The film is filled with a lot of meaningful dialogue and it's meaningful because its true. Vincent (Cruise) brings up the topic of a man who died on the subway and his body was on the train all day before anybody even noticed he was dead. This brings up the point of ""what can you do to make a difference"". There are 6 billion people in the world, what makes you different? How can you stand out of society and not just be another cab driver, another fast food employee. Now that's that part of the movie. The other part is a well-paced intense film that will grip you and won't let go. Michael Mann knows how to make a movie but in the past his films have been rather slow-paced and even boring at times even though they have a lot of depth and meaning. Collateral is neither slow-paced nor fast-paced, it's well-paced. The last half hour will have you're heart pounding and your body snug in your seat just trying to anticipate what might happen in the next 2, 4, 6 minutes. This movie was really intense and very well made. You know that this could have been a disaster of a movie, but with so many veterans on board they turned it into something very good, very good indeed.

ACTING: The acting here was top notch, very good. But it's really the writer you have to credit here. The dialogue is where the emotion is evoked from the audience. Every word that the characters say has meaning but the actors deliver it the way it's supposed to be. Tom Cruise was excellent, a very haunting role for the audience to watch. He's not just a killer, he's a thinker. He knows what he's doing and even though he's the bad guy, he is a smart one. I am not a fan of Jamie Foxx's work but if he does more films like this then my opinion on him will surely change. A great cast that delivered a superbly written movie.

BOTTOM LINE: There are times in the movie where Jamie Foxx could have escaped and ended it all, but you can counter that by saying he became emotionally involved. The movie is a near perfect suspense drama. This is not some stupid hijacking movie with stupid dialogue and fast car chases. If you know Michael Mann's work then you know you can expect something good, and even if this is your first Michael Mann movie you will enjoy this dark themed drama. When you live in the present you gotta ""roll with it"".",1091836800,,3020,4.2595818815331015
1531799,4,B00005JN2Z,"Michael Mann gives us another good film.  This time, he really uses the actors to convey a great movie.  Moving away from his regular type-casting, Tom Cruise plays a hitman named Vincent.  In the driver's seat, is taxicab driver Jamie Foxx.  His name is Max.  Now that they are introduced to each other, the night begins.

Vincent offers Max $600 to drive him around to make his ""runs.""  Max gives in and takes Vincent for a spin.  They start off with good conversation and seem to have a friendship starting.  After his first stop, Max is eating a sandwhich in the car when a body falls four stories on top of it.  He realizes that Vincent caused the falling body, and now, he knows what he is dealing with.  For the sake of his own life, he continues to drive Vincent.

They make another stop to exterminate another guy.  No biggie, just part of the job.  Then they go to a jazz club.  Max believes Vincent is just going there to buy the two a round of drinks.  He later realizes, that there is another target at the club.  Vincent murders this guy in front of Max, and he sees Vincent at work first hand for the first time.

Then, Max gets word that his mother is worried about him.  Turns out, his mother is in the hospital, and he always visits her when he gets off of work.  In order to not make suspicion, Vincent tells Max they need to visit the hospital.  While there, Max steals Vincent's briefcase, which has his list of targets inside it, along with other things like money, ammo, and such.  From here, Vincent chases Max, but Max throws the case over a bridge, and everything is lost.

So, they must go see a man at a club to get a new list.  Here, Max has to pretend and pass as Vincent.  Max has to go in because Vincent cannot reveal his identity.  So, the FEDS believe Max is Vincent, but a narcotics officer (Mark Ruffalo) knows the truth.  When they go to a club for the next victim, trouble stirs, but the job is done.

After this incident, Max decides he must take command.  So, he wrecks the vehicle, and Vincent runs away.  Max believes his night is over, but realizes that the next target on the list is of a woman (Jada Pinkett Smith) that he had given a ride to earlier that night.  So, now, he must turn into a hero a save the girl.  This leads to a high speed chase on foot that is a race against the clock and Vincent.

This movie is really good.  A lot of the film depends on the acting and the quality of the acting.  Can you see Tom Cruise as a villain?  You can after seeing this film.  Cruise really does have a wider range of acting than that big-smile good guy type.  He still has his smile, but it even looks sinister.  It may be his best performance since the film Magnolia.

Jamie Foxx is also very good.  Most of the film works on the two main character interacting with each other.  Foxx is able to display his emotions to the point.  I thought he was good in Any Given Sunday, but here, you know that he can really do more than comedy.  He's grown up since his days on In Living Color.

Collateral really does grip the audience.  You cheer for both characters.  A lot of people are seeing this movie to see Tom Cruise as the bad guy.  That's a good thing because he gives a great performance.  He's an actor.  He does it for a living.",1091836800,3,3277,4.223300970873787
1531800,5,B00005JN2Z,"Collateral is one of the best thrillers I've seen in quite some time. The mood is dark and remorseless, presumably to accentuate and emphasize these same qualities in Vincent (Tom Cruise), a professional assassin who has chosen Max (Jaimie Foxx), an everyman character with a heart of gold and big dreams to chauffer him to his targets' homes/hangouts. All would go well for Vincent if Max would just drive the cab... but he doesn't. Revealing more of the plot would be doing this intelligent movie a great injustice, but let's just say that the movie is a real rollercoaster, varying in intensity and setting often, never losing us in what could have easily been a boring vehicle for A-list actors and directors to fill their time. Along the way, we learn much of both of these characters, whom director Michael Mann obviously cares a great deal for. Truly superb acting, storyline, directing, settings, music, tone, and mood make for a great movie that deserves awards and recognition as one of the best thrillers of the last decade.",1091836800,,1035,4.853107344632768

1531802,5,B00005JN2Z,"I went to see a matinee of Collateral show expecting a much different movie than I saw. I was expecting a lot of violence, over the top characters, and not to much of a story. What I got instead was possibly the best movie of 2004.

Max(Foxx) drives a cab in Los Angeles for a living. He says it's his side job and his plan is to one day run his own limo service. He takes pride in his work in being the best cabbie in LA. He picks up Annie(Smith)who bets him her way to getting to downtown is faster. He wins the bet and charms over the girl. He's to shy though to ask for her number when she leaves. She comes back and gives it to him, and we see that Max really is a nice guy whose plans are taking him longer than expected.

A man quickly enters the cab. He asks Max to take him to his destination and Max give him an ETA. After he makes the ETA the gentleman give him a proposition. He'll give him $600 to drive him around the whole night. Max reluctantly agrees to the man. He introduces himself as Vincent(Cruise) and says he looks forward to a great quick evening.

Things quickly turn bad when a body falls from the second floor onto the cab. Max realizes Vincent just killed the man though Vincent just says ""I shoot him, the bullets and the fall killed him."" Vincent takes Max hostage and tells him he will drive him around town or he will kill him. Now Max is stuck with Vincent as he takes him to murder people. The ultimate target though is the DA Annie who Vincent just met and likes. Now he must stop Vincent and save innocent people before they die.

The acting in Collateral is terrific. Jamie Foxx is great as Max. This is a different role for him. He's known more for his comedy and cocky characters like in Any Given Sunday. Max is an Average Joe kind of guy we can all relate to. His plans aren't coming as fast as he wants them to. Foxx plays the role to perfection and he has me really looking forward to seeing him play Ray in The Ray Charles movie later this year.

Tom Cruise steals the show as the killer Vincent. It's a much different role for Cruise because he's the bad guy. He takes the bad guy and runs with it. Vincent is a cold killer who does it for a living. He has no remorse for the people he kills. He's confident in his abilities but not cocky. He'll do anything to achieve his round as he shows to Max in brute force. Cruise brings an intensity to the character. He's charming when he needs to be and we see that Tom Cruise we love. He becomes Vincent and is flawless. This is one of his best performance of his storied carear and is as good or if not better than some of his Oscar nominated performances. At this point he has to be the favorite for what should be a ""Best Supporting Actor"" nomination.

Michael Mann directs this film to perfection. A lot takes place in a cab and he utalizes a a lot of different camera shots so you don't get bored during all the dialogue. He allows the characters to develop in the movie and thats what makes the movie drive. He shots the fight scenes to perfection especially the big one in the club.

Steven Beattie wrote the movie and he has himself an Oscar caliber screenplay here. His only other big time writing was with Pirates of the Carribean and he exceeds that here. The script is beautiful. It's comical when it needs to be. The dialogue never drags and it isn't boring. He doesn't waste lines in the movie and it's why the characters develop so well.

Collateral is a great movie. The critics nationwide have loved it. It's not some cheap action thriller. Michael Mann doesn't let us out that easy but puts together a great action thriller with character and substance. The movie is flawless. There isn't anything not to like. Bring on the Oscars because this movie deserves some and maybe Tom Cruise can finally get one because he sure does deserve it. You don't want to miss Collateral.",1091836800,,3880,4.262228260869565
1531803,4,B00005JN2Z,"When a normal taxi cab driver winds up with a hired assassin you would think it would be non-stop action for the whole film.  Yet it is not, and that is one of the great aspects of this movie.  Jamie Foxx plays the average guy, a taxi cab driver with hopes and dreams that he understands will never be his.  Cruise plays the calm yet calculating killer who is just trying to get a job done.  We can relate to Fox's character the most, but, like Reservoir Dogs, redemption is the theme here. Redemption in the sense that both characters try to explain to each other, and themselves, why they do what they do only to get a better understanding of their mediocre life.  Both are given the power to change their life, but the story is really whether one will.

The director, Michael Mann, adds to the story with offbeat camerawork, including a lot of hand held shots used with a lesser quality camera.  This gives the movie a more distinctive feel, while the great music overtones Cruise's and Foxx's characters life with mellow serenity.  Actually my favorite part is not the action, yet instead it is the three or so minutes where Michael Mann just does some beautiful shots, all while an Audioslave song, Shadow of the Sun, plays over.  Michael Mann repeats that same kind of filming later too.

In summary, Collateral, is not too quick action wise, has very little ""gore"", and has no twists in it.  That is because this is a more intelligently done action film, with great characters, cinematography, and a beautiful score.  I feel that Collateral is definitely deserved of some Oscars.",1091836800,,1586,4.625
1531804,4,B00005JN2Z,"Cruise saved us from last years dull movie season with The Last Samurai. This year, he is back to save us again with Collateral.

Collateral is a very intelligent, yet simple action movie. Tom Cruise plays a cool hitman named Vincent. This is one of Cruise's best characters ever. If you enjoy dumb muscle bound, Vin Disel type badguys you might not fully appreciate the movie. If you enjoy a smooth talking, Charismatic, Clint eastwood style badguy then you will love this movie..

Jamie Foxx's character isn't very exciting. He plays, well.... just your average guy(who works as a taxi driver). Ahh, but that's just what we need! When Foxx's average guy character gets taken along for a wild ride with Vincent(Cruise), we feel like we are taken along too(because we can relate to Foxx). Jamie Foxx did an excellent job with this difficult role. Playing a regular guy in a crazy situation, that movie watchers are constantly asking ""would I react like that, if I were in this situation"", is a hard role.

1531805,4,B00005JN2Z,"4/5

The premise sounds pretty dull, doesn't it?  Tom Cruise plays a hit man who coerces a cab driver to drive him around LA to knock off five people.  Jamie Foxx portrays the reluctant cab driver.  Director Michael Mann proves that a compelling drama doesn't require an excess in plot, car chases or violence or humour.  Much of the film takes place in the cab with Cruise and Foxx exchanging philosophies of life, goals and dreams.  Foxx, a cabbie for 12 years, wants to save up to open a limo service.  Cruise is more enigmatic about his past, but instead is a relentless, cold-blooded assassin.  Still, he's not one-dimensional at all.

Cruise is excellent as the laser-focused killer with taste.  Witness the scene in the jazz club to see how good his taste in music is.  He's not cocky like the mastermind bad guy in the first Die Hard, but he is cool, confident and obviously emotionally detached from his victims.  He doesn't care who they are since he's just doing his job.  He also doesn't flash the million-dollar Cruise movie star smile.

Jamie Foxx also performs well as the uncomfortable cabbie counterpoint to the Cruise character.  He's just your average joe hoping to get ahead in life but obviously taking a long time to get there, just like most people.

What's refreshing about this film is that it doesn't scatter the character development over too many players.  The lack of comedic lines also reinforces the grittiness of the script.  Michael Mann has produced a mostly believable thriller, that makes the competition look like cartoons for adults.

Sure, there are stretches in the storyline but so long as you're prepared to gloss over them, this is a fine film.  Collateral is also much better than Cruise's last film, the pretensioulsy bloated The Last Samurai. Anyone looking for a non-stop action film or a ""Lethal Weapon""-type film should look elsewhere.

1531806,5,B00005JN2Z,"""Collateral"" is a beautiful film: vibrating with gorgeous digital-clear shots of Los Angeles from Pico-Union and Downtown to Hollywood and Koreatown. And like director Michael Mann's previous ""Heat,"" ""Collateral"" is a visual tribute to Los Angeles. But ""Collateral"" is also a tribute to the acting talent of Tom Cruise who doesn't seem to get all the credit he is due: for example his excellent work in ""Samurai"" went virtually un-noticed last year.

As Vincent, a cold blooded hit man, Cruise shows us once again that he can not only look good on screen, he can play a role completely against type and succeed admirably: his Vincent is cold, calculating, resolutely committed and totally focused on completing his task. Cruise's Vincent is a professional assassin: he kills for money because it is his job and is probably unsuited to much else; yet at the same time he revels in the hunt and the catch: enjoying it, feeling no remorse at all.

Along the way he enlists/coerces/forces the help of a cab driver Max (Jamie Fox) who resists but ultimately adopts some of Vincent's amoral characteristics. Max becomes Vincent's unwitting disciple and his avenging angel.

Michael Mann has directed with a keen eye and a jaundiced view of what makes Los Angeles, Los Angeles:  the City of the Angels, the final frontier of last chances, every inch the Wild Wild West where everything is cool as long as you wear the right clothes, have the right haircut and drive the hottest car.",1091750400,2,1475,4.888
1531807,4,B00005JN2Z,"""O' Oscar, Where Art Thou?"" is a phrase that Hollywood super-star Tom Cruise has become all too familiar with, especially as of late. Ever since his break out in Risky Business, a film, as good as it may be, is hardly Oscar material, Cruise has made numerous attempts to take home the golden statuette by taking on roles in such high-profile dramas as Born on the Fourth of July, A Few Good Men, Jerry Maguire, Vanilla Sky, and Magnolia, only to come up nearly empty handed (he received Best Actor nominations for his roles in Born on the Fourth of July, Jerry Maguire, and Magnolia). But his last two films (Minority Report and The Last Samurai), quite possibly the best chances at an Oscar nod in years based on critical as well as public acceptance, failed to produce even a nomination. Does this affect his career, let alone his own self-esteem for his craft? Hardly! Cruise continues to take risks as an actor, which includes performing in a role that doesn't suite his personality: the villain.

The story centers on an ordinary man living in the big city just trying to make a decent living as a cab driver until one day he picks up the wrong guy at the wrong time and becomes embroiled in a situation he never could have imagined. For twelve years Max has been a cab driver in the city of Los Angles, a position that he envisioned would only be temporary until he saved up enough money to start his own limo service, one that would be like a ""club experience"", but some things in life don't always work out the way we envision them. Take for instance, one night Max picks up a man named Vincent, a person who one would describe as well put together, who ""hires"" him to drive him around to five locations that night for double the amount of money he would normally make in a single night. Max, believing him to be a decent hardworking guy, agrees to the deal only to shockingly discover that his occupant is actually a contract killer sent by a narco-trafficking cartel to eliminate five individuals, both witnesses and prosecutors, involved in a federal grand jury trial set to take place the next day. Though Max tries everything in his capacity, which, at times, can be quite limited, to escape, Vincent forces him at gun-point to drive him around to each location. As the increasingly distressing night drags on, Vincent and Max become more dependent on each other and begin to reveal within themselves aspects of life they never once considered before - aspects that will change the course of their own lives forever. The story for Collateral is not all that complex and, in a sense, remains fairly predictable from beginning to end but the way Michael Mann successfully blends an intoxicating atmosphere with sympathetic characters and brilliantly choreographed action sequences, that feel neither drawn-out nor short-lived, that make it the most fascinating storylines this season.

One of the most striking aspects about the film is the way the filmmakers allow a small group of performers to carry the entire feature without missing a beat. Though several background characters are brought in and out throughout the film's two hour time length, they are, in essence, meaningless to the audience as many of the main actions occurring on screen primarily affect the relationship between Vincent and Max, played brilliantly by Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. Tom Cruise, who is better known on the big screen for playing the hero rather then the villain, could have been disastrous had he ended up like most actors who break their usual mold, but he demonstrates that he's just as good, or even better, being bad. The grey-haired, clean-cut Vincent may seem intelligent and even debonairish in certain respects, which makes the character all the more enticing, much in the same way Anthony Hopkins portrayed Hannibal Lecter ... a person so interesting and majestic that you can't help but root for him at times, though in your heart you know should be hating his guts. The other reason the character works so well is the way his acts and reacts with the character of Max the cab driver, played by Jamie Foxx. The film starts off with Max as the weak-willed, cautious pawn in the grand master-plan that he can't control, but as time goes on and their conversations become more and more profound, his personality changes in such dramatic fashion that it snaps the audience's moral compass back in line by having them root for the man they should be interested in from the beginning.

Overall, Collateral started like any other film and could have ended up the disaster it should have been (based on the clear-cut final sequence it finished with) but its impressive cast, tense atmosphere, brutal violence, and, more importantly, its austere message make this film the sleeper hit of the summer. The ending is not disappointing in the sense that is flat or uninteresting but rather that if one figures out early on that Jada Pinkett-Smith's appearance in the film is more then just a mere cameo (if you caught the appearances on the late-night talk shows, this should be a given to you), the way the film wraps-up isn't all that surprising. But this hardly deters the audience from having an enjoyable experience none the less. The aspect, one that literary wizards will adore, that sets Collateral apart from other thrillers is the Richard III-ish affect it has on the reactions of the audience. Early on, we should be hating Vincent, a man who viciously kills people without any second thought, but the character is ten times more interesting then Max, who comes off as a cautious neat-freak rather then a hero, that we are easily attracted to him and, dare it be said, root for him even though we know deep inside that we should be loathing his actions. Only when the real hero emerges in Max and he finally begins to escape the precarious shell he has kept himself in do we begin to shift our attention to the person that deserves it the most. Collateral's message, one that is hammered further and further into the minds of movie-goers as the story unfolds, that life should be lived to its fullest and one should take advantage of every minute of every day. This may sound simple and even clichd but once you've seen this film, it's easier to understand and therefore take to heart once you've exit the theater.",1091750400,,6322,4.745454545454545
