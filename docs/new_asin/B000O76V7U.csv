8183429,3,B000O76V7U,"Tokiko loves her criminal boyfriend but is also pursued by her rich boss to serve as his mistress. She and her boyfriend decide to carry out one last heist before retiring to a normal life of happiness. This is a classic Japanese silent film by the master, Ozu, and it features many cinematic innovations. Its well done for the time, but for the casual viewer its not compelling enough to keep ones interest. All around average. View only if you're interested in this type of film or this film maker.",1486857600,,500,4.566666666666666
