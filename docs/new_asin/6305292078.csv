1006268,5,6305292078,This show relates to every teenager!  My friends and I quote lines from the show all the time.  I cannot express how much this show means to me and many other teens.  The writing is amazing; they must have used a board of  real teenagers to create the plots!  This is the best show ever created.,930009600,3,295,4.196428571428571

7887061,5,6305292078,"With My So-Called Life has come the most magical awe-inspiring  show that has ever aired on television.  In junior high, in high school, and now even in college this show remains close to my heart.  Claire Danes' entire career is and will continue ineviatbly to go nowhere but down.  I wrote a One Act in high school.  It could have been a lost episode of the show.  This show has become part of my psyche, my art, and yes, my so-called ""life.""  The words and events of these characters, no, these people forever reverberate in my mind.  I see parts of myself in each of them.  The Breakfast Club was my sanctuary.  My So-Called Life is my ecstasy.  I will steal the tapes from my offbeat local video store and give them to my kids.",978220800,2,732,4.348148148148148
7887062,5,6305292078,I love this show soooo much! I cry at every one coz its so close to life.  I live in England and they are totally unheard of now. I really want the  tapes. Can anyone out there give me a hint on how to get them as no where I  know ( shops or on the net) can get hold of them and I'm going CRAZY!!!!!,968025600,3,299,3.5

If anyone who could give me a hint to find a place to buy them please let me know, and let`s collect  signatures to send to the studio, to make they produce the tapes (or dvds  )again!",960163200,,296,4.157894736842105
7887064,5,6305292078,"""My So-Called Life"" was dead before it even started.  ABC had no faith in what has become a cult classic and adored by millions across this great big wide world.  The story of one teenage girl, Angela Chase,  captured the attention of everyone I know.  We loved this show.  It was so  well written and amazingly cast.  It showed what life really was like as a  teen and gave everyone a glimpse into the mind of a girl who was just like  us.  And, the smartest thing about this show was that it wasn't written for  teenagers.  It didn't talk down to them, and it treated them with respect  and admiration.  It will always been a sad thing that we didn't get to see  more of it...but,then again, that adds to the brillance.  We will always  wonder what happened next.  It's a must have for everyone!",957225600,6,797,4.342465753424658
7887065,5,6305292078,"Why won't anyone of this TV people listen,everyone loves this show. I live in England and they don't even show it here anymore. Can comeone PLEASE bring it out of DVD so we can watch it over here again? I have a few tapes  of the show and they are getting worn out. So now I'm going to say what  everybody already knows,that it's the best show ever and yes I do relate to  Angela and I really hope that I can get hold of some tapes of it or  something before they all disappear.",949449600,2,478,4.0
7887066,5,6305292078,"This is so close to real life it is scary. this series deserves more than just 5 stars, it showed so many of the things that we go through everyday, everything from that zit on our chins or noses, to people getting alcohol  poisoning. I was so sad and dispointed when they discontinued the series, I  think ABC made the biggest mistake ever by doing that. It is by far and  away my favorite series ever and I am so glad that I can get it on video  now to watch it whenever I want.",933897600,5,480,4.021052631578947
