He was a boyfriend of my cousin Paul Keenan (of Dynasty and Days of Our Lives). The director and editor nail this sexy doc without being exploitive, sterotypical or judgmental",1443484800,,313,5.1568627450980395
7874831,4,6304595360,"I knew Tom McBride when he lived here in Charleston, WV and he always seemed to be a very nice, friendly guy. I was very sad to hear of his death and looked for a long time to find a copy of this film. I was impressed with the respectful way the whole subject was treated and the openess that Tom had with his disease. Also he was very open about his past sexual history. It's a decent documentary about an A-Gay guy who fell from grace with the NYC A-Gay's because, as he puts it, he was no longer a new face and he had the nerve to talk about his disease in public.",1231718400,5,567,3.9391304347826086
