8475971,5,B0012FW62C,I loved this short film. It is very inspiring and proves no one is too old to learn as long as we have life left. This is true for any instrument or subject. We just need the desire. As a piano tuner the excuse I hear most often for not learning to play is that there is not enough time. There is enough time even if you devote just 15 minutes a day to learn you can.,1368057600,,367,3.779220779220779
8475972,5,B0012FW62C,"This is a wonderful documentary about an 80 year old lady who embarks on learning to play the cello. It is produced by the cello teacher herself and offers the hopeful message that ""it's never too late"" to learn something new and to enhance one's life. This is definately a ""feel good"" dvd and makes a great gift.",1263513600,,313,4.413793103448276
