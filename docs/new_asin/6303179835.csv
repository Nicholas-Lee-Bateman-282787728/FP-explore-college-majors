7839976,3,6303179835,"Not really much was there to be honest. This was something to teach high schoolers with. It really doesnt dawn on ""withcraft"" on a whole, because it really doesnt talk about certain kind of traditions or go into into the history such as Gardner and other well know wiccan authors to explain what witchcraft is.
Anyways, it does tell about the Salem trials however i didn't think it went deeper within the history. Also, it was too much into voodoo, eventhough it is part of it; its not all of it. All i say to those that want to buy this, is to look somewhere better than this VHS about witchcraft...its good and watchable, but, not that great.",1052784000,3,644,4.466101694915254
7839977,3,6303179835,"Although the satanist in the video clearly says that he is not a wiccan/witch, just the presence of a satanist in the video gives the impression that witchcraft involves devils and/or demons (it does not).  Excluding the satanist part, the video was just O.K. It didn't really give  much useful information and anyone looking to buy this video to learn about  modern witchcraft or wicca, in my opinion, will be disappointed.",949622400,13,424,4.943661971830986
