8102636,3,B000DN5VNA,"You've got to be into Hal Roach to squeeze anything meaningful out of this film. If you are just browsing along and feel like watching a free movie on Prime, you'll hate it. This thing is rife with stereotypes and cliches which back in the 1940's and 50's people accepted as funny. It's one of those ""I wonder what people of the future will think of this here movie we made"" moments. The main character is a crotchety self-centered opinionated old fart. Back in the day that must have been funny, but today it's stupid. I only watched it (not completely) because I was interested in what the Hal Roach studios did after their 1930's heyday. For that it is worth the price of admission and no more.",1432944000,,697,4.453125

8102640,3,B000DN5VNA,"Spindleshanked but supple veteran character actor Clem Bevans is given a rare lead in this 1949 film, not released until five years after, as Sam ""Bigmouth"" Smedley, a Wyoming resident who entrains to Pilgrim Hill, Massachusetts to visit his daughter Janet (Virginia Grey) whose letters have impressed him as being indicative of a need for parental help. Sam is an abrasive, jabbering curmudgeon and quickly discovers that the basis for his daughter's dissatisfaction lies with her lawyer husband Tom's primary client and neighbor, wealthy Jonathan Smith (Cecil Kellaway), an officious gentleman but also the most powerful person in the quiet seacoast town and Sam's response to Janet's discontent is to do away with Smith by ""causing"" a hurricane to appear while Smith is alone on an offshore island. To create the hurricane, Smedley performs a rain dance taught him by an Indian and observed by the local sheriff, after which coincidentally a hurricane does, indeed, appear and the sheriff, believing Smith to be drowned, wishes to arrest the old westerner for manslaughter, but able hands attempt to intervene in order to extricate all from their troubles. A low-budget Hal Roach, Jr., production, this little-known film provides hardly anything with which to recommend it, and Bevans actually becomes irritating rather than endearing, but treatment given the opening scene featuring two other character actors, Frank Lackteen and Oliver Blake, as train station vagrant but prosperous Indians proves to be well-written and quite funny.",1140652800,,1538,5.385892116182573
