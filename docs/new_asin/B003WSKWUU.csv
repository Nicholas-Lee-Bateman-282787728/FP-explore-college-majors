8622348,3,B003WSKWUU,I worked in a video shop in the 80's when this was released and it is a great show but the quality od this dvd is bad i also bought two other The Master dvd's on the Synergy Arcive series they were both cdr's and the quality wasn't the best i see they are no longer advertised on Amazon who i bought them from. I agree with one of the previous reviewers if you search you can find the whole series yes all the episodes that were made and the quality is better than this. I'm giving the item 3 starts because the quality of the dvd is crap but the show deserves 5 stars.,1274832000,,569,3.9565217391304346
8622349,4,B003WSKWUU,"Bought for my son for Christmas.  Interesting to see Lee Van Cleef in a non-western role, and he comes across pretty well as a ninja master, imparting his wisdom to a young headstrong apprentice.  The villain of the show is played by Sho Kosugi, who's the real ninja master, and he really does a great job with the special effects.  It's not preachy, like the Kung Fu series was, mostly just lots of martial arts action, with the stars performing barely super-human stunts (nobody actually flies or floats or anything like that).  And you get to see Demi Moore before she was a big star.",1240531200,,587,4.561904761904762
8622350,4,B003WSKWUU,"The Master is a great, but short-lived, show from the mid 1980s, influenced by the ninjo boom of that time. This dvd is worth getting if you are a fan, but you have a great deal of technical problems to get over if you are looking for dvd quality.

What is great is that the entire two season series is available now on dvd and the quality is excellent. (THE PRODUCT ABOVE IS NOT THE SERIES) You have to poke around a little to find them, but they are out there and will give you hours of ninja antics.

As an aside, Tim Van Patten, who plays the Master's side-kick, is a very accomplished director with shows like the Sopranos, Sex in the City, Deadwood, Rome and many others to his credit.",1229731200,12,691,4.2272727272727275
8622351,1,B003WSKWUU,I agree with the reviewer who said this is a great show (I remember watching it when I was a kid) but it NEEDS to have the video and audio fixed before they put it on DVD.  Please!!!,1228435200,5,182,3.789473684210526
