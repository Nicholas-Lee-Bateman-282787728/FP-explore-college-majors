7845113,4,6303336299,"these are sweet little productions from the nineties with soft-foam  puppets created by the talented folks at jim henson's creature shoppe.

timmy is a  happy-go-lucky, small-voiced little tooth-guy who has all sorts of adventures with his faithful companion Brush-Brush, a toothbrush shaped  sort of dog stand in.

there are always musical numbers and themes of co-operation and tolerance are stressed.

look for this in discount bins at your local video stores, dollar outlets, and on amazon.com b/c they don't make them anymore, and that's a shame. my nephew has memorized most of the songs and we delight in putting  the tapes on  and singing along with Timmy.

""Molar Island"" is his favourite. I'm thinking about ordering a back-up copy in case this one ever wears out, that's how much we think of it and how good it it is.

Sweet, well-made, harmless family fun hearkening back to an era before CGI and rampant product placement.

Enjoy these videos, we definitely did!",1217203200,,975,4.9937888198757765
