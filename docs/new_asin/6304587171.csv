7876222,5,6304587171,"We watch this video each year during the Christmas season.  It is absolutely wonderful!!!  It isn't about tinsel and pre-holiday noise.  It is a visit to the place where Jesus was born.  Perry Como could have retired after this program.  It is the apex of his work.  Our VHS disintegrated this year, but we have located a dealer who offers a DVD version.  We highly recommend the program to anyone who celebrates Christmas.",1388275200,,423,4.712328767123288
7876223,5,6304587171,Best Christmas dvd I've seen. Shows the true meaning of Christmas in a very real yet entertaining way. It is filmed on site in Isreal and also shows How the Jews celebrate their holiday to some extent.,1360281600,,201,4.45945945945946
7876224,3,6304587171,"Upon my first viewing and review, I basically panned this video.  Since then, I have watched it many times over and have decided that this is one of Perry's finest Christmas specials.  If you are a Christian or a Catholic (like Perry), you will find the hairs on your arms standing up.  You can tell Perry feels the same way.  This is how Christmas started and Perry takes you there in a way that no other could.  Buy this video if you can - it's worth it!  This IS Christmas!",1154044800,4,476,4.233333333333333
7876225,4,6304587171,"You won't find it here. This video is good, but if you're looking for a Christmas-y feel by watching the visuals, you'll be disappointed. But if you close your eyes and listen to Perry's wonderful voice, especially on ""Ave Maria,"" it'll sound a lot like Christmas.
Although this video isn't as traditional as some others of Perry's, it is an interesting video. I've visited Jerusalem, Bethlehem, and the surrounding areas, so the video was a wonderful trip down Memory Lane for me. I liked the native songs of the area, especially ""Tradition"" and ""Havah Nagilah.""
This 48-minute video was shot in 1980, and there is a dated feel to it. But I like that, so I didn't mind.
If you're looking for a non-traditional Christmas video, this is good for a once-a-year addition to your favorites. I have the double set, which also includes Perry Como's Early American Christmas. I think the set is referred to as Perry Como's Christmas Classics.",975628800,4,935,4.813664596273292
7876226,2,6304587171,Wonderful to have Perry in your living room again at Christmas time but unfortunately this video falls short.  There isn't alot of Christmas-y material in it and I was left disappointed.  Only die-hard Como fans will  truly enjoy this video!,944179200,2,241,4.975
