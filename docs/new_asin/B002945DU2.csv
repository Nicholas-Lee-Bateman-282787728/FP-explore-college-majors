3875800,5,B002945DU2,All of the movies were great and quite a surprise at the quality of the DVD's,1268352000,4,77,3.875
3875801,5,B002945DU2,"TCM's Sci-Fi collection is truly great collection of four films.
""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is one of the all-time great films. A very interesting film about a flight to the Saturn system, the discovery of a simple black slab on the moon and the insanity of a computer! You have to watch this film to appreciate it. No words can explain it.
""Soylent Green"" is food. A very unusual film. Quite distrubing for it's time and now.
""The Time Machine"" another H.G. Wells novel come to life. Very good special effects and story. Interesting concept and characters.
""Forbidden Planet"" is one of the greatest Sci-Fi films ever made. It's very advanced for the time (1954) and the story is terrific. The characters are really good and the cast is excellent. See if you recognize anything abpout this film in relation to other films and TV shows which came after.
Every review I've ever read about this film always mentioned Shakespear's ""The Tempest"". Well I'm only mentioning it because all the other reviews did too. I've never read ""The Tempest"" nor seen an adaptation of it so I have no idea if it resembles that play. I just took the film by itself.
Buy this collection. You won't be disappointed.",1264204800,13,1189,4.69377990430622
3875802,4,B002945DU2,"This is a good sci-fi collection. Personally,I think ""2001"" is overrated like many of Kubrick's films but there is no denying its influence. Both "" Forbidden Planet"" and ""Time Machine"" are classics,offering good storylines,memorable characterizations and the feminine charms of Anne Francis and Yvette Mimieux,respectively. While I think ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"",""The Thing From Another Planet"",""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"",""Them"" or the later ""Close Encounters"" would have been more worthy candidates for inclusion,""Soylent Green"" is not without its merits,though the modern viewer will figure things out fairly early on, I suspect. All in all,pretty darn good and ,at this price,a good value ,too.",1259625600,7,710,5.771428571428571
3875803,5,B002945DU2,Received the item on time and was happy to see the quality of the DVD's.  There are 2 DVDs with 2 movies each.  Read side A as side B has no titles.  I thought I would get 4 DVDs but after reading side A I was happy to be able to save storage space by having them this way.  I am very happy with the movies and service!  It is wonderful being able to buy my favorites like this and have ordered more classics as well.  If you like older movies and want to get good quality and save money then these are the packages for you!,1258156800,18,524,3.850467289719626
3875804,4,B002945DU2,"as noted elsewhere , these films are presented in their proper aspect ratios and are all fun classics . with todays' heavy reliance on CGI in sci-fi filmaking , these films are more than desirable , they're essential . all films have english subtitles .",1257811200,37,253,4.644444444444445

3875806,5,B002945DU2,Really enjoyed this product. My favorite Sci-Fi movies in two DVD's. Really like this one.,1256256000,5,90,5.066666666666666
3875807,5,B002945DU2,"These TCM collections are an effort by TCM/WHV to bring classic films to the masses at a low price. There are four films on two discs and no extras, but unlike the Warner Archive discs these are pressed DVDs consisting of restored films.

My favorite in the bunch is ""Forbidden Planet"" (1956). A military group of space explorers land on a planet inhabited only by a scientist (Walter Pidgeon), his daughter (Anne Francis), and Robbie, the Robot. When the commander of the military group says that the scientist and his daughter must return with him to earth, members of the exploratory group begin dying - victims of vicious attacks from an invisible monster. This is also available in a more deluxe version as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forbidden-Planet-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B000HEWEDK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forbidden Planet (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>.

The Time Machine (1960) has Rod Taylor as George, a scientist who invents a time machine and travels into the future on New Year's Eve, 1899. He winds up in the year 802,701. On the good side, the earth is lush, and its human inhabitants beautiful and gentle. On the bad side, these humans are completely amoral and indifferent to one another's well-being and completely disinterested in anything but pleasure. He does meet one girl there, though, that may have the potential for being something more than this. This movie is also available separately as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Time-Machine/dp/0790747324/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Time Machine</a>, although the only extra feature is a behind the scenes documentary.

2001 - A Space Odyssey - This is a most unusual film, just as you would expect from director Stanley Kubrick. It would be oversimplifying to say it is about space exploration, there is such a strange mixture of images and sound. This is available in a more deluxe form as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2001-A-Space-Odyssey-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B000UJ48SG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2001 - A Space Odyssey (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>. It contains commentary, a documentary, and several featurettes.

Soylent Green (1973) - I have mixed feelings about this one. I saw it in its original run, and in many ways it suffers from a lack of imagination. It sets the earth, and New York City in particular, on  a linear trajectory to deterioration using the problems of 1973 as a basis - population control and air pollution. Now the U.S. has a problem of population replacement, much like Europe, and air pollution is not nearly as bad as it was in the 70's. The possibility of severe climate change had not been thought of yet. The idea of the corrupt wealthy few and the suffering masses still ring true - actually even more true now than in 1973. And then there is Edward G. Robinson's last film performance. He had a rather small role but he made the film for me. This is available as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Soylent-Green/dp/B0016I0AJG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Soylent Green</a>, which contains commentary and two featurettes, including one on Edward G. Robinson.

If you want to explore some classic science fiction in film, this would be a good buy.",1246665600,8,3355,5.836734693877551
3875808,4,B002945DU2,"Warner's TCM GREATEST CLASSIC FILMS COLLECTION is a series of over two dozen twin packs. The four titles in each set are dubbed one per side on two flip discs. Only some movies include bonus features. Transfer quality of these well-preserved ever-popular films is top-notch.

The four in this pack are any Boomer's delight, from our childhood friend Robbie the Robot (""Forbidden Planet""), to a primetime NBC-TV fave (""Time Machine""), to trippy late 60s Drive-In movie fare (""2001""), to a more sobering experience (""Soylent Green""). For any who missed these in first run, they remain prime examples of superior vintage science fiction-- deftly combining fine casts, nicely-crafted scripts, skilled cinematography and quirky (by today's standards) yet often engaging special effects.

SYNOPSES--

FORBIDDEN PLANET
An Earth colony on a planet 17 light years from home is nearly wiped out, so an expedition is sent to investigate. Curiously, the only two survivors don't seem to want any help from Commander Abrams and his men, but Abrahms won't leave until he gets some answers.

SOYLENT GREEN
In the (now not too) distant future, an overpopulated Earth broils from the greenhouse effect. Many plants and animals are extinct, so the hungry billions are nourished with color-coded foodstuffs from the Soylent company. There's yellow and red, but their very best is Soylent Green. When the company's president is murdered, a detective's investigation uncovers a horrible secret.

TIME MACHINE
Directed by pioneer special effects wizard George Pal, this adaptation makes author H.G. Wells the main character. After watching the rapid forward passage of time via changing fashions in a nearby ladies dress shop window, Wells rides his machine to a distant future where society is divided into meek surface dwellers and underground cannibals who prey on them.

2001
Episodic, gently paced story encompasses the cosmically assisted rise of humankind from hairy cave dweller to space-traveling modern man to our ultimate pre-planned destiny. Along the way we thrice encounter a mysterious ebony-hued monolith, experience artificial gravity, grapple with a powerful cyber-mechanism gone haywire and watch a man in his prime age, die and undergo embyronic transformation (perhaps into a higher life form?).

3875939,5,B002945DU2,"Four classic SciFi movies.

Forbidden Planet is my favorite,  It was SO far ahead of its time as a good scifi, during a time when scifi movies were looked down on, and usually considered B movies by the major studios and audiences alike,  The budget was very large for s scifi pic back in the day.  Robbie the robot - a very classic ""actor"" who is known by scifi fans.

2001 - what can I say.  A true classic although I find it so darn slow.  Who can forget HAL?  Great realistic models and space scenes considering when this film was made.  Personally, I could do without the first 15 minutes. And even today, the discussions continue  with varying opinions on  what  is the meaning of the black monolith?

TIME MACHINE a good movie from a classic book.  Not much in special effects..

SOYLENT GREEN was the talk of people for a short time when it came out.  ""Green"" theme for sure.  OK movie, from a just OK plot.",1427760000,,915,4.319526627218935

3875973,5,B002945DU2,Love these old films. Soylent green what a great movie and of course 2001. This came with four seperate DVD's. What a great value!!,1405814400,,131,4.5
3875974,5,B002945DU2,"This is a great deal - four movies for one low price.  They are all classic Sci-Fi movies.  It is interesting to watch them in chronological order starting with the oldest Forbidden Planet, to the newest - Soylent Green.  You can see how American culture has changed over the decades.

Forbidden Planet, from the 50's has a World War Two vibe, everyone on the spaceship looks and talks like they just walked out of a WW2 submarine movie.  The special effects are cheesy to modern eyes, but pretty good for the time.  Sort of similar to The Day the Earth Stood Still, but in color.  You can also see that the writers of the first Star Trek series borrowed ideas from this movie.  For instance, the ships captain, first officer, and doctor, are the three main characters - just like Kirk, Spock, and McCoy. As was prevalent at that time, the government was to be believed, trusted and obeyed.

The Time Machine, from the 60's reminds me of other films from the era, like Journey to the Center of the Earth or War of the Worlds.  Sort of a squeaky clean, family, Disney ambiance.  No sex, minimal violence and profanity.  Just the sort of thing for kids, but also fine for adults.  You can see the concern for nuclear war that was prevalent during the Cold War era - the sound of the air raid sirens was something I was familiar with as a kid, so it pushed all the ""duck and cover"" buttons I had growing up.  There is also some great social commentary with the relationship of the Eloi and Morelocks that went right over my head when I was a kid.

2001 enters the 70's with a sort of movie version of the psychedelic era.  Great music and visuals and a plot that makes no sense unless you read the book first.  I reviewed this movie elsewhere on Amazon so look for that review if you want more of my thoughts on this movie.

Soylent Green is the most recent of these movies, in the mid-1970's.  If I recall correctly, this movie came out about the time of the first Earth Day, so the movie is full of environmental doom and gloom.  The big American cities were in decline at that time as well - remember the NYC financial problems and crime of that era? - so those two ideas form the setting for the movie.  It all seems so overwrought looking back, but it set the tone for much of Sci-Fi going forward - movies like Blade Runner and the zombie apocalypse movies can all trace back to this prototype.  You can also see the evolution (maybe devolution would be a better term) of movie making here as well.  Much more sex, violence, and profanity compared with the other three movies reviewed here, also setting a trend for much of the movie making that followed.",1399680000,14,2658,4.3905930470347645
3875975,4,B002945DU2,"These are four great films, especially the original Time Machine.  For a major release carrying the TCM brand, I'm surprised at the lousy packaging of the discs. They stacked the DVD's one on top of the other, rather than separate compartments.
I would have given this 5 stars except for the fact that the packaging is really low rent. Shame on TCM",1398211200,3,348,4.612903225806452
3875976,5,B002945DU2,"This really turned out to be a good buy since nearly everyone in my family now wants to borrow it. It comes in a rather bizarre four-on-one-spindle case, but as far as I can tell, it keeps the DVDs from scratching each other. Seeing the Time Machine again was wonderful, and the best part was the circa-1980s short film included on the disc in which a rather aged and wrinkled Rod Taylor explained the making of the movie, and particularly the construction and fate of the Time Machine itself. Seeing Soylent Green for the first time reminded me of Charlton Heston's hammy acting, but very poignant was watching E.G. Robinson's final film role before his death. I am looking forward to watching the other two after my kids return it -- heh -- overall, you can't go wrong with this!",1396396800,8,781,4.585714285714285
3875977,4,B002945DU2,"Excellent movies, high quality prints. Only drawback is discs are stacked 4 deep in the case (no sleeves) making them awkward to handle and easily scratched.",1394668800,5,157,5.076923076923077
3875978,5,B002945DU2,"I bought these for myself and I'm thrilled to have each one, let alone in a package. Great additions to my DVD library's Science Fiction section!",1393891200,,145,4.615384615384615
3875979,5,B002945DU2,"I remember watching Soylent Green growing up and was talking about it recently with a colleague of mine. That conversation made me think back and want to watch the movie again, but I couldn't find it on any of the streaming services we subscribe to. Luckily, I found it here and was expecting to pay for only Soylent Green, but lo and behold, it came along with 3 other gems that are worth getting as well.

Remember when Leslie Nielsen had brown hair? If not, then go ahead and watch Forbidden Planet, included in this set. It still amazes me how versatile he was as an actor. I first saw him in Airplane! and had no idea he was in Forbidden Planet until many years later I happened upon it on late night tv (until that point, I thought he was strictly a comedic actor). 2001 and The Time Machine are timeless classics as well. The original version of The Time Machine is much better than the remake. Back then, movies actually had those things called ""acting"" and ""plots,"" rather than CGI and other digital wizardry that largely seems to dominate cinema today.

This set is definitely worth adding to anyone's collection who yearns for the Hollywood of yesteryear. Now if I can only get my hands on Westworld...........",1391472000,5,1221,4.570776255707763

3875981,5,B002945DU2,"I enjoyed all four of these movies, even though I purchased it just for ""The Time Machine"".  The special features on The Time Machine were fantastic.  There is a nice documentary on how they came up with and made the machine itself.  Interesting that it was lost for a while but found and restored.  I was also really happy that they included a mini sequel that was filmed many years later in which Rod Taylor's character is traveling through time and meets his friend who is headed off to war.

I even owned a single copy of 2001 with a trailer and no extras,  So it was a real surprise to see four films each with their own set of extras.  It turned me into a fan of this quartet style.  2001 - the best.  Forbidden Planet - classic.  The Time Machine - old classic that has lost none of it's power.  Soylent Green -very good and the last film of Edgar G. Robinson.  Both the story and the film remind me of that Twilight Zone episode: To Serve Man.

3875994,4,B002945DU2,"I bought this mainly for 2001--still fascinated by its special effects and wonderful estimation of future technology--but was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed every movie in the bunch.

Soylent Green is solid, having a sixties vibe that still works today.

Forbidden planet was surprisingly good, with Leslie Nielsen (yes the guy from Airplane movies) as the star. If you see it, you will immediately pick up on just how much this movie influenced the original Star Trek series. The fun banter between the crew. Yes, the special effects were dated, though probably great for their day. Still, the movie works well, with the same formula the highly entertaining original Star Trek series used, and used just as effectively here.

Even the Time Machine was likeable, and I didn't have great hopes for it. Yet, it delivered, fun and fascinating.

These are all great stories; a very worthwhile buy for the price.

Enjoy!",1382745600,,920,5.026315789473684

Messed up the overture from 2001, sounding like a magnetic tape that had been played too many times.  Really a waste of time, product not worth anything, and these movies will be at the dump in the morning.  I would not sell them to anyone, would not give them away.  I could not in good conscience pass these along to anybody.  Can not really see why anyone created such poorly manufactured copies.  These are about as far from being re-mastered as anything I have seen.  May even be burned from old tape- to tape copies.  Lost much respect for amazon after seeing this mess.

3876006,4,B002945DU2,"""Forbidden Planet"", ""The Time Machine"", ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", and ""Soylent Green."" A great collection by any standard. The additional features are pretty good, if not a bit amateurish in places. My only complaint is the packaging. Stacking all four DVDs on the same spindle is just an opportunity to scuff them up.

Forbidden Planet: Made in 1956, it was nominated for an Oscar for special effects. The plot is solid, if not simple, and the cast appropriate to the theme. Anne Francis is simply beautiful and Nielson a perfect leading man. Walter Pidgeon plays doting father and distracted scientist simultaneously. The movie paints a very hopeful future for human-kind and it remains on of my favorites from this era.

The Time Machine: Released in 1960, about as true to H.G. Wells story as a film can be without running more than an hour and a half. The cast is pitch perfect with an amateur scientist and his four quirky business friends. A very late Victorian view of the world, the Time Machine itself looks like it belongs in a parlor. George Pal won an Oscar for best effects.

2001: A Space Odyssey: Made in 1968 and filmed primarily in England, Kubrick went to extremes to create believable sets. The rotating Saturn probe is convincing and the space scenes believable. The costumes look dated, but not the space suits or space-craft. Of course the cast was perfectly chosen. The voice over with Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood is worth the watch; they explain a great deal that isn't always obvious. This is one of the most thoughtful SciFi films ever made.

Soylent Green: Released in 1973 this movie presents the result of global warming and food shortages. Thrown into this future is a murder mystery which is a pretty reliable plot. The difference is the cops are only slightly better off than the teaming masses and even the rich are affected. No special effects to speak of, the film is about the story.",1365292800,4,1921,4.75975975975976

Forbidden Planet started it with a good plot and at the time state of the art special effects that still look good today.  2001 is classic story of mankinds rise and future.  Soylent green is an alternate history of what could have happened with overpopulation and the decline of resources.

I saw the movie six times that summer I was so enthralled by it. 2001 A Space Odyssey is a movie that stands on its own merit. What can one say except this is genius Stanley Kubricks most shining legacy. Forbidden Planet is a movie that was far ahead of its time and could be called the Star Wars of the 1950's.

Please note that the ""beaming"" scene in this version of ""Forbidden Planet"" is digitally-edited (censored?) for content!

The crew is shown in quite a startling and graphic manner in the orignal ""polarization-beam"" which is not shown here. Their skeleton, organs, and circulatory systems were quite vividly portrayed. Here it is replaced with a mild green beam-ray effect and looks more like the ""beaming-up"" on Star Trek.

Otherwise, the best copy of Forbidden Planet I have ever seen; as are 2001 and The Time Machine.  A great value if it is on sale, and movies quite worth owning.",1323129600,2,729,4.716535433070866

Just order this four-fer and have a great, loooong night watching some of scifi's best offerings.  Of course, we all know that '2001' is a huge classic.  From the Dawn of Man to all the weirdness inside the monolith at the end, 2001 is a long, strange trip (and looks great in this transfer). -- Of course 'The Time Machine' with Rod Taylor and Yvette Mimieux is both speculative science fiction and two-fisted space opera.  Rod builds a time machine and goes forward in time, finding a society that doesn't benefit humankind all that well.  What's really interesting about 'Time Machine' is how it discusses, as early as the 1950s, the ideas behind quantum physics and how it relates to space/time.  Plus, the Morelocks are s-c-a-r-y. -- 'Forbidden Planet' is wonderful to look at, but kind of slow moving.  Okay, it's actually very slow moving ... but the point of this movie when released in the early 50s was to bring to the screen a large, breathtaking spectacle.  And on that score, this movie doesn't disappoint.  The characters in the movie may walk slooowly through the sets, but the sets themselves are worth looking at.  And of course, there's Robby the Robot.  And Anne Francis.  And Robby the Robot. -- And I've saved the personal best for last, 'Soylent Green', starring Charlton Heston and a terrific Edward G. Robinson (his final film role).  We've all heard the tagline, ""Soylent Green is people"", but actually, that's not even the most interesting thing about this large and exciting movie.  Heston, as a futuristic cop, and Robinson, as his case-worker, really do bring some movie-magic to their roles.  The sets are top-notch, even though the early 1970s version of the future doesn't look all that futuristic anymore.  Throughout, 'Soylent Green' (as directed by Richard Fleischer, who gave us 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea) is thoughtful, exciting and even a little moving.  Certainly one of the best scifi movies of the 70s.  But it doesn't matter the decade, every one of these movies are worthwhile, and they're all together.

3876046,4,B002945DU2,"If you like classic sci-fi these four films are pretty good. Nice wide screen transfer not really scary but
enjoyable to watch. Reasonably priced.",1299024000,,146,5.125
3876047,4,B002945DU2,"In their continuing release of movie packages,Turner Classic movies releases this compilation of four famous Sci Fi films:001-a Space Odyssey(released April/68),Forbidden Planet(released April/56),Soylant Green(released April/73)and The Time Machine(released Aug/60).
2001 -A Space Odyssey is the reigning classic in this group. The now familiar story involves the famous opening of a mysterious but intelligent monolith of extraterrestrial origin influencing the endeavours of early ape-man. When the time fast forwards ahead to 2001,the same or another monolith is found embedded on the moons surface. A signal is sent out from it to Jupiter and a ship is dispatched to check out something strange orbiting the planet there. Along the way the ships computer goes awry and starts to kill its' crew members. It almost succeeds except for one  who manages to carry out the mission but at the same time finds himself enveloped in an incredible experience. This version is the more popular 148 minute release;the original came in around over 10 minutes more. The print is clear and crisp and is in its original widescreen a/r. Extras include just commentary by stars Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood. This film is the most accurate to its book that I have ever seen. With its' completely logical and detailed technology driven look,its' a winner all the way. Five stars.
Backing 2001 is Soylent Green,starring Charlton Heston and Edward G.Robinson. It's story involves a future earth where everything including the basic necessities like food is in short supply. Most edibles are doled out to lines and lines of a dejected populace in the form of different coloured ""soylants"";green being the most coveted. Heston is a cop who has grown up in this crazy world and Robinson is his elderly roommate who remembers when things were different. Heston's duties drag him into a murder involving a man with controlling interest in the soylant trade. This in turn leads Heston to uncover the startling truth behind what soylant green actually is. This film has been transferred well and while showing its' age it is generally a good print. Extras include:commentary,a featurette on the film ,a look at an MGM tribute to Edward G's 101st film and the trailer. It's in its original widescreen a/r. 3 1/2-four stars.
On the other two sided disc we find first The Time Machine. This beloved film stars Rod Taylor as a turn of the century inventor(1899)who has invented a time machine. He travels backward then most importantly forward;hundreds of thousands of years forward. He comes upon a race of young and innocent people on the surface while below ground lives a race which feeds regularly on them,like cattle. The inventor with his own ideals interrupts this terrible cycle so the surface race can gets its life back. He returns briefly home to meet colleagues and quickly goes back to the future to presumably live out his life. A wonderful film directed by the venerable George Pal. Extras include cast and crew bios,the trailer,awards and a wonderful /93 featurette narrated by Taylor which looks back at the film,its' famous prop the time machine itself and an acting reunion between stars Taylor and Young. They re-create a what-if scenario where Taylor comes back to see his old friend and take him with him. Precious. The film has been transferred wonderfully and is in its original widescreen a/r. Four solid stars.
The other side contains what many consider a Sci Fi classic,Forbidden Planet. The story involves a rescue mission to a planet in the Altair system. The ship is in the classic shape of a saucer and when the crew lands they are greeted by a huge robot. They are taken to a house where a scientist and his daughter live. They warn of a mysterious creature that has been attacking of late and soon the ship itself is under attack. However a deep underground facility with strange machinery used millenia ago by a now extinct race they find is the real culprit behind the roaming monster and its attacks. It is the way the scientist has utilized the equipment,which now threatens all their safety. Filled with still nice s/FX the movie's plot is a ponderous beast in itself and the set up takes far,far too long for this reviewer. The best things to come out of this movie for me was the interesting cause of the ""monster"" that threatened them all and Robbie the Robot. Extras include:deleted scenes,lost footage(actually found footage!),2 clips from the MGM TV Parade series w/Walter Pidgeon,the trailer and a Feb/58 ep of the Thin Man TV show. The print is clear and crisp and is in its' original widescreen a/r. Three stars.
This release of four wonderful Sci-Fi movies and all in one place makes a very appealing addition to ones collection. All the prints are wonderfully clear and in their widescreen a/r's. The drawback is that they are on two double sided discs which makes for dicey handling;not my favourite way of getting movies by a long shot. Turner was also remiss in excluding the fact they were all widescreen movies on the outside cover of this set. I hesitated for ages before I bought it because of that alone.

Other movies to consider are all the remakes of the old classic sci fi movies.  ""Time Machine (""Time after Time"")"", ""War of the Worlds"", ""Day the Earth Stood Still"", and of course the legendary ""KING KONG"".

3876054,5,B002945DU2,"It's hard to fault the price for four classic SF movies. ""The Time Machine"" is difficult to find, and when you do, it's at least the Amazon price for these four. Now, as to the movies, it probably helps if you remember seeing them when you were younger. Those who've grown up with computer graphics often do not appreciate special effects made with models and other early tricks of the trade. Once you get past that, however, ""Time Machine"" holds its own--the story is strong, the characters well-developed. Yes, a little cheesy on the romance, but a thought-provoking film nevertheless. ""Forbidden Planet"" -- Shakespeare's ""The Tempest"" in SF form. ""2001"" -- this rewrote special effects until Lucas came along with ""Star Wars.""  In terms of ""watch-ability"" today, it's interesting, thought-provoking, and cinematically unique, but you'll be tempted to fast-forward some of the space shots, unless you're a classical music fan. Also, if you put yourself in the mindset of the late 1960s, you can appreciate the interesting fashion and design choices of the ""future."" As for ""Soylent Green""--this was part of Heston's comeback, but the weakest of the four movies. Once you know what ""Soylent Green"" is, it's not that interesting to watch again.",1291507200,2,1244,5.098039215686274

Soy lent Green is also a good sci-if mystery. I never agreed with Hestons later politics but he was a wonderful actor. Forbidden Planet Stars a young Leslie Nielsen in an interesting film. Probably the least best of these movies, but the special effects are way better than you would think. The Time Machine is also a fun, even if a little dark, sci-fi film.

8357396,3,B002945DU2,"Recently, the TCM 4 movie sets are being redone and I am a little disappointed with the results.  It used to be you would get 2 double sided discs (which TCM has wisely moved away from) and then it was changed to 4 discs with the film and its associated bonus features on each disc or each side.  For many (not all but many) of these films the bonus features were interesting including things like: biographies/documentaries on the actors or the era of the film and things like warners a night at the movies which had a film short, cartoon, and newsreel to go along with the film.  To me in the $15-$20 price range ;and I found many cheaper in the $10 range) this was a much more affordable alternative to buying the movies separately.  You got a lot for your money.  With these new sets, not quite so much.  For the new set you get 2 DVDs (not double sided so that part is good) with two movies on each disc and thats it (if you're lucky you could get a theatrical trailer).  If you are just after the films, then this set is for you.  For people like me, who aren't just interested in the film but also its history and the extras associated with the dvd I would say look elsewhere, if possible to the original TCM Greatest Classic sets which unfortunately look like they are rising in price now.",1521158400,,1297,4.286885245901639
