2431251,2,B000BO0LLI,"I first saw this production of Agatha Christie's ""Murder on the Orient Express"" when it was aired on Network TV back in 2001, and was more than excited to see it.  I am a fan of the novel, Albert Finny movie, and even of the BBC radio drama version (which is still the closest adaptation to the novel).  And while the acting, direction and the over all look is fine... I had a problem with the modern spin that was taken on it.  Especially where Poirot uses a laptop computer to find information that he needed on the background of the case.  Which left the traditional ""detecting"" out of the window, and made me think that the modern Poirot is only as smart as his Google search engine will let him.",1131408000,16,700,4.320610687022901
2431252,1,B000BO0LLI,"Even with Alfred Molina and Peter Strauss, this production leaves a lot to be desired.  Poirot and computers and PDAs?  Please!

2431253,1,B000BO0LLI,"A poor updated attempt to remake a classic film.  While any remake of a classic is difficult, this tv movie was extremely poorly done with an unremarkable cast.  Alfred Molina sleepwalked his way through the film as Poirot.  He had absolutely no chrisma nor humor.  Not much more can be said of the remainder of the cast.  The attempt to update by giving Poirot a love interest really missed the mark.",1185408000,2,401,4.591549295774648
2431254,3,B000BO0LLI,"After watching Sidney Lumet's wonderful 1974 version of Murder on the Orient Express, it is hard to understand why anyone would want to remake it. However, the earlier version did have some glaring problems - the waltz music, which I hated even in 1974, although the kidnap music makes up for it - and Albert Finney, who is a great actor, but a caricature in that movie. David Suchet has the wrap on Poirot, but Alfred Molina is an interesting choice and very watchable. Vera, the thief, is actually a creation of Agatha Christie and appears in a couple of her stories (not as sexy of course, but I like the updated character) and Poirot is obviously in love with her even in Christie's more sedate stories. That said, this movie obviously suffers from a lack of budget - the supporting cast is often interchangeable and hard to sort out since the men all look alike, the lack of snow, the lack of period, everything on a laptop screen rather than the wonderful newspaper scenes in the original. If you haven't seen Lumet's version, then you have missed the real deal. But I gave this one a three because of Molina's performance - less eccentric and more human. Even Christie is said to have hated Poirot.",1180137600,,1205,4.583333333333333
2431255,1,B000BO0LLI,"I'm not going to reiterate other reviewers' specific criticisms of this movie. However some general comments for your consideration...

Dame Agatha's books and characters seem at times to suffer mightily at the hands of filmmakers. For example, take George Pollock's four early '60s films starring Margaret Rutherford, whose Miss Marple bore little or no resemblance to the character in the books. Remakes have been even less kind to the Dame. The best (worst?) example of remake-itis is And Then There Were None. Rene Clair's 1945 B&W film is very good (two versions available,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/restored-original/dp/B00005QBZL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">restored original</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/bargain-priced/dp/B00000IO3S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">bargain priced</a>), and true to Agatha Christie's play of the same name (which has a justifiably different ending from the novel). ATTWN was remade twice (in 1965 and 1974), and neither came up to the standard of the original.

That brings us to Murder on the Orient Express. Sidney Lumet's 1974 film of Agatha Christie's remarkable novel was a star-studded atmospheric period piece. This 2001 made-for-TV remake, brought into the Internet age, was an incredible waste of time and money. For the same price as this turkey (which didn't air until 2005, which ought to tell you something), you can get the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/stellar-1974-version-on-DVD/dp/B0002I832C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">stellar 1974 version on DVD</a>&nbsp;for (at this writing) the same price! Spend your money wisely.",1159660800,9,1722,6.894495412844036
2431256,2,B000BO0LLI,"Modernized adaptation of Agatha Christie classic mystery? Excuse me, but what is the point?

Anyway, the famous story about the murder on the Orient Express is retold. A stubbed body is found in a train on which a world-renowned detective Poirot is traveling from Istanbul. The passengers are interrogated, but their contradicting statements only help confuse the investigation.

So far, the same, but remember, this time the story is told in modern setting. That means Poirot doesn't have to use his brain to obtain some of the important information. Blackmailing is done with a video tape, and luckily one of the car is equipped with a VCR. In case you think the new film lost the exotic touch, it can show you a belly dancer.

There are also some visible changes done to the Christie's whodunit, most of which are pointless. For example, the train is stopped by rockslide, not by avalanche, which means much less claustrophobic feeling. Hercule Poirot (Alfred Molina) has a girlfriend in Istanbul named Vera (Tasha de Vasconcelos) and she happens to a reformed thief.

And of course there is a murder. Sorry that I cannot reveal too much about it, but if you have seen the Sidney Lumet film or read the original book, this remake would only disappoint you. Alfred Molina is not bad the Belgian sleuth, but he is not Albert Finney who was in character.

Of course you don't always have to compare. Some people have not seen the 1974 version, and they will see the newer version without (perhaps unfair) comparison. However, even they might find the murder mystery here too slow and talky, and the solution is way too incredible. Actually, most of the Christie books end with incredible solutions, but there is one unique quality about the original story of the `Murder on the Orient Express' which is totally missing in the new version.

That is, as you know (and I am trying to write without spoilers), Agatha Christie's story is inspired by one of the biggest and most notorious real-life crimes committed in the history of America as the background of her story. The (unsolved, some say) mystery plays a significant role in the original book and Sidney Lumet film, but in the new film it is completely taken away, replaced by one fictional crime that is not intriguing at all. The altered setting makes the whole story less authentic and the motive of the killer or killers more unaccountable.

Remakes are often considered unnecessary, but some of them can hold on its ground against the originals. You may prefer the original Peter Lorre version, but the remade ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" is generally more popular than the other. As far as `Murder on the Orient Express' is concerned, however, I don't see any reason this should be told again.",1156032000,13,2752,4.793248945147679

While the original film uses a storyline that has hints of 'the Lindburgh' kidnapping, this one falls flat. It took a lot of energy just to sit through it (I was hoping it would get better....) I would not recommend this to Agatha Christie fans.",1496793600,,421,4.410256410256411
8089924,5,B000BO0LLI,"Many reviewers panned this 2001 version of Murder on the Orient Express because there were several changes made to some events, to the time period and to the characters, as compared to the book and to the 1974 Albert Finney version (which was excellent). However, I don't think the changes made in this movie affected the story in any major way. The original story takes place in the 1920's, but this movie updates it to the year 2000. In this movie we have a group of nine passengers on the train (instead of twelve in the original story); the train gets stranded because of an avalanche of rocks (instead of an avalanche of snow as in the original story), Poirot gathers clues from an internet search (instead of a newspaper search as in the original story). Some characters were dropped from the original story, and other characters were modernized. The famous aviator in the original story became a software developer in this one; the butler became a personal trainer; the Russian princess became the widow of a South American dictator, and there were other such changes which bothered some folks, but none of it changed the substance of the original story. I liked the way the story developed in this 2001 film, and I liked the way Poirot delivered the final conclusion.

One thing people didn't like about this version is that Poirot had an on-again off-again, long-distance relationship with a beautiful jewel thief named Vera, who owned her own nightclub in Istanbul. Many people found it unbelievable that the prim and proper, balding, overweight Poirot would have a love interest. But in fact if you are familiar with the books, you would know that Poirot did fall in love with a beautiful jewel thief named Vera in ""The Double Clue"", and in the end he sent her away from England so that he wouldn't have to turn her over to the police. He meets her again in ""The Labours of Hercules"" when they are older, and she was in fact a nightclub owner by then. So the Vera we see in this movie is not a farfetched character invented just for this movie. She is a real character in Poirot's life, as penned by Agatha Christie. The main difference between the books and this 2001 movie is that in the original stories, their relationship seemed to be purely platonic; but in this movie, it was obvious that they did have a sexual relationship. And Alfred Molina is a much more dashing version of Hercule Poirot than the short, balding, overweight detective described in the books.

All in all, a very enjoyable movie. Not excellent like the 1974 version, but very enjoyable nevertheless.",1416096000,,2587,4.708609271523179

Adam James .as. William MacQueen
Dylan Smith .as. Tony Foscarelli
Peter Strauss as Samuel Ratchett
Directed by: Carl Schenkel

 Although it takes many liberties with the original Agatha Christie plot, it does so respectfully. This is a very entertaining movie. It is very simplistic; it doesn't demand that you choose law over justice. I enjoyed it and all of my friends who have seen it reported that they have enjoyed it as well. It certainly has earned four stars and a place in your library of most loved cinemas.

Poirot was asked to come to Istanbul by his girl friend Vera Rossakoff to solve a murder that took place in her casino. He solved the murder, had a disagreement with Vera and was about to book a flight back to London when he ran into an old friend M. Bouc who was a Director of the Compagnie International des Wagons-Lits, which operated the Orient Express. When Bouc learned that Poirot was about to fly to London he insisted that he ride back to London with him on the Orient Express saying that it was the most luxurious train in the world. They both boarded the train. The trip was going very well; Poirot was enjoying the dinning car and the scenery of a beautiful country side flashing by as they rode along. At dinner a passenger, Samuel Ratchett, attempted to hire Poirot to find the rogues who had threatened him. Poirot turned him down saying ""I find you intolerable."" That night the train ran into a big rock slide that prevented it from going forward; the train's master man contacted the next station and asked them to send a utility engine and a work crew to dig them out. The next morning Ratchett was found dead in his compartment; he had been stabbed nine times. Bouc pleaded with Poirot, and finally persuaded him to investigate the case for the sake of the passengers.

Poirot questioned each of the passengers in the Calais Coach, and despite the beauty of the surroundings, tempers flared. Finally one of the passengers challenged Poirot who responded assemble all of the passengers in the dinning car and I will revel my solution to the crime. Poirot's first solution was: At one of the stations an unknown man, possibly Mafia related, boarded the train wearing a conductor's uniform over his ordinary clothing; he had a pass key in his pocket. He entered Ratchett's compartment when Ratchett was drugged with a sleeping pill and killed him; he stabbed him nine times. Then he used a communicating door to enter an adjacent compartment. When the train stopped at the next station he removed his conductor's uniform, left it in a passenger's luggage, and disembarked the train. Although that solution was well received, Poirot proceeded to describe a second more complex scenario, which he characterized as murder by an international conspiracy of software engineers, entrepreneurs, and refined ladies. The latter was so complex that it was unbelievable. Then he asked M. Bouc to select one of the two solutions; Bouc responded saying I think Justice has already been served. When they arrived in Belgrade Bouc reported that he had presented the first solution to the Police who said that it sounded reasonable to them. Poirot said softly, yes it was reasonable; its only flaw was that it wasn't factual.

Then Poirot spotted Vera walking along the edge of the station's platform next to the train. She said she was so intrigued by the beautiful and exotic Orient Express that she couldn't bear missing the chance to ride in it. She and Poirot boarded the train to Calais; they occupied adjoining compartments with a communicating door.",1390867200,2,4119,4.842329545454546
8089927,4,B000BO0LLI,"I really enjoyed this movie. It had a great cast and a rather interesting and satisfying twist to the ending, which I thought was perfect.

The scenes on the Orient Express in particular are so beautiful. They brought to mind a time not so long ago, when train travel was the height of elegance and style. Nice to see that some of that is still available now, if money is abundant! ;>) Makes me want to take a trip on this famous train too.

A great way to while away an evening.

I haven't seen the original version but now I plan to check that one out too.",1388016000,,558,4.148148148148148
8089928,5,B000BO0LLI,"I like this movie. It's not a big name type of movie, but it's still really nice. I also like the original.",1339804800,2,107,3.909090909090909
8089929,3,B000BO0LLI,Of course it is not as good as the original Sydney Lumets version but enjoyable.. Sad to say but Alfred Molina's accent was shocking. It was also filmed on the American version of the Orient Express. I've been on the continental train and it is really like Lumet's version. The decor is all wrong in this version. Agatha C in the 21st century loosos its charm.really don't know why they bothered making the film.,1285372800,2,412,4.581081081081081
8089930,1,B000BO0LLI,"The back of the DVD case claims that ""Agatha Christie's ultimate whodunit speeds into the twentieth century,"" and that's a pretty good indication of this production's incompetence. Yes, for the record, they probably meant ""twenty-first"" century, since Christie's book was written in the twentieth century. Actually, bringing this mystery into the twenty-first century is part of the problem - does anyone really need to see Hercule Poirot performing internet searches? Much of the novel's atmosphere came from the fact that everyone was trapped, snowbound, in the train, and Poirot had no way to solve the murder except to reflect. In this movie, Poirot has access to search engines and online video, which means that he's about as isolated as I am now, writing this review.

Due to time constraints, a lot of characters have been cut from this movie entirely. Generally I don't mind that sort of thing, but MotOE is the one novel that really can't accommodate that kind of editing. Maybe the writers would have had room for more suspects if they hadn't wasted time on a completely pointless love interest for Poirot? And in the ""pointless changes"" category, I don't really care if the producers decided to change a Russian princess into an Eva Peron-style dictator's wife. Actually, I do care, because it's dumb, but I understand that there aren't a lot of Russian aristocrats in the twenty-first century. Still, having changed the character, the writers then leave in a clue about the South American dictator using the Cyrillic alphabet? They gutted half the book's plot and couldn't take out the one thing that should have been removed?

It's impossible not to watch this movie and not compare it to the 1974 Sidney Lumet version. The 1974 version is better in just about every way, from sets to music to, most especially, actors. Meredith Baxter, you are no Lauren Bacall. To be fair, though, I actually preferred Alfred Molina as Poirot to Albert Finney 1974 version. No, Molina isn't really well cast, but he's inoffensive, and that's more than I can say for Finney's portrayal of Poirot as screaming, rude, and bizarrely hunch-backed. Still, it's pretty sad when the best thing I can say about this movie is that the lead actor is inoffensive. Stick to the 1974 version, at least until David Suchet does this story right.",1212451200,6,2328,4.951406649616368
8089931,2,B000BO0LLI,"It is Alfred Molina's great misfortune that, in portraying Hercule Poirot, he has been preceded by Peter Ustinov, Albert Finney, and David Suchet.  Had this not been true, we might have been tempted to give his performance a higher rating than it is now possible to do.

The original novel by Agatha Christie (same title) is one of the greatest whodunits ever penned.  For unknown reasons, Ustinov never did it.  My guess is that, although his Poirot films were made after the timely death of the pernicious and much-despised Code, the prospect of a murderer getting away with the crime was still too daunting for Hollywood.  Suchet has yet to make Orient, but then it was only last year ('07) that he finally did ""Mrs. McGinty's Dead"" (with, we hope, Ariadne Oliver).  Suchet's voice is used for Poirot in the 2006 Orient Express video game.

So finally, in 2001 a TV version of Orient is made with Alfred Molina in the key role.  Alas.  Molina is a talented actor.  His portrayal of Poirot, while not definitive nor even close, is passable - even pretty good in some ways.  However, once we compare him with his predecessors (not to mention the literary original), the problems show up like fat, pendulous, juicy pimples (the kind we all loved to pop back in the day).  We all know, for instance, that Poirot was fastidious to the point of school-marmish fussiness.  Molina's Poirot is neat and that's about it.  Molina's accent is a sort of generalized European, not the pointedly confrontational French that Poirot affected.  Molina does use the catch-phrase ""little grey cells"", but he rattles them out because they're in the script, not because (as is the case) Poirot is obsessive about them.  Indeed, Poirot's fundamentally obsessive character is de-emphasized to the point of vanishing.  Molin'a Poirot seldom speaks of himself in the third person; Poirot does so rather a lot.  His mustache is some short hair under his nose; Poirot's is a fashion statement and accessory that defines his dandified appearance.  Molina doesn't wear gloves.  Nor spats, but then the date of the mystery has been moved up to about the date the film was made.  Anyone who by now believes I haven't made my case doesn't know Hercule.

While Suchet is the best Poirot overall, Ustinov bears away the palm for best actor.  He inhabits the role so effectively that we become unconscious of his imposing height and bulk.  Finney, who appears in the 1974 Orient, lacks for little in the Poirotishness of his portrayal.  This is a competition that Molina simply can't win.

The plot of the 2001 film is, incidentally, pretty much the same as that of the novel and the 1974 film.  Poirot is traveling from Istanbul on the famous Orient Express.  He shares the first class car with a diverse set of individuals.  One of them, a highly unpleasant person (Ratchett) is stabbed to death in the dead of night.  There are plenty of clues ... in fact, as Finney's Poirot observes and Molina's does not, there are too many of them.  The train is stalled in its journey (snow slide in 1974, rock slide in 2001) and the railway's CEO commissions Poirot to find the killer.  Through patient questioning and separating false clues from real ones, Poirot does so ... twice.  If you don't actually know the plot already, your cultural deprivation is truly unfortunate.

The problem with the 2001 production, however, runs deeper than merely the star.  It's virtually the whole cast and what the update in time has done to their roles.  The update from 1935 to c. 2001 was apparently made because the producers figured that education has been so inadequate recently that viewers would never figure out what a White Russian (Princess Dragomirov) is, nor understand references to the Lindburgh kidnapping, nor fail to be puzzled by people going to Iraq for actual constructive purposes (archaeology), nor ... well, you get the gist.

The result is that we have characters who are updated but far less interesting.  As for the participating actors:  recall that in 1974 we get Martin Balsam, Richard Widmark, Wendy Hiller, Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman, Sean Connery, Michael York, Vanessa Redgrave, Anthony Perkins, John Gielgud, ... well, again you get the gist.  Want a cast list of the 2001 film?  Well, there's Leslie Caron, and Who? ...and Whom? ...and What? ...and Which? ...and ...and ...and ...  well, and a group of actors, most of whom are still working.  They appear primarily in small roles in TV series episodes and in fairly little-known films.  The upshot is that we get OK performances of a fairly uninspired script, and that's about it.  The exception is from the one fine actor in the group, Leslie Caron.  That's the upside.  The downside is that her performance is deeply informed by that of Wendy Hiller as Princess Dragomirov.  In this film the character becomes Se&ntilde;ora Alvarado, the widow of a fairly nasty Latin American dictator.  The problem here is that the character has way more social standing than would someone coming from such a sleazy background.  She is in fact treated as the royalty Dragomirov was.  That is, the character doesn't really compute ... in order to keep character relationships as they were before the rewrite, Alvarado had to be accorded deference even Eva Peron didn't get in exile.  Still, Caron manages to convince us of her bona fides.  As I said, she's good.

The cold, hard fact is that there are quite a few things on TV that are better than this remake.  That's something we can't say about the 1974 original.  The Poirot of the remake, Alfred Molina, is a pretty good actor - but for whatever reason he has seriously misconceived the part he plays and as Poirot he winds up in 4th place in a field of 4.  The picture, alas, winds up in about 9th place in a field of 2.",1207958400,4,5800,4.790322580645161
