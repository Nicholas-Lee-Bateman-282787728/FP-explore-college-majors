8074338,3,B000A4JYV2,"During a routine training exercise, Slav Girl, a submarine of the Russian Navy, gets severely damaged by an old WW2 underwater mine, and is stranded on the bottom of the ocean, 72 meters below the sea level.

OK, the story of director Vladimir Khotinenkos 72 Meters looks like that of a Hollywood action movie, but the Russian film is in fact a low-key drama about the crew members of the doomed ship. In the films flashbacks several events that precede the main storyline unfolds, like a love triangle between two best friends/crew members Pyotr (Marat Basharov) and Ivan (Dmitry Ulyanov), and Nelly (Chulpan Khamatova), a beautiful girl they both fall in love with.

Unfortunately, those flashbacks are not really interesting. The main story about the characters trapped inside a submarine fares much better, but not enough. But of course it can be that non-Russians like me are only missing the humor and other nuanced layers behind the surface.

Here are a few interesting things about the film. Veteran composer Ennio Morricone provides the soundtrack music. Nikita Mikhalkov (Burnt by the Sun) is, according to IMDb, an uncredited producer. The film also includes a sequence that reflects the complicated Russian-Ukraine relation. Otherwise, the film is nothing but an OK drama whose story happens to be set in a navy submarine.",1401494400,,1334,5.082191780821918
8074339,3,B000A4JYV2,"This is a story of people and friendships, of frailty and inner courage. Everything in this film is told in a low key, understated manner. And that, perhaps, is its strength. The story unfolds at a leisurely pace, which I like. Sometimes I wish the characters were fleshed out more -- we get to know the two leads ok but I wish we knew more about the others -- but what is here is quite good, though depressing. Time is running out for the survivors trapped underwater in a heavily damaged submarine. There is no happy ending.

I found this summary on the web:

""The film begins in the 1980s Soviet Union. Two best friends, Orlov (Basharov) and Muravyev (Ulyanov), are serving at the Black Sea Navy Base in Sevastopol, Crimea. Both fall in love with one beautiful girl Nelly (Khamatova), and their friendship suffers a first blow. Because she picks Muravyev, his friend Orlov struggles with an inferiority complex and becomes a secretive alcoholic. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, both friends are transferred to the Northern Fleet on the Polar Ocean. One day their sub is performing a routine training. A disturbed WWII mine slowly moves on a collision course with the sub. A mighty blast knocks down everyone inside the wrecked sub, 72 meters below the sea level. Then ensues a nerve-racking struggle for survival.""",1293580800,,1333,4.766233766233766
