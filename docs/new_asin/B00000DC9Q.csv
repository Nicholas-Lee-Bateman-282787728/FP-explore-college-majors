7905869,1,B00000DC9Q,"Don't bother with the public domain episodes of ""The Lucy Show."" You're throwing away your money. The audio and video quality isn't very good. Buy the official season releases of ""The Lucy Show."" We already have seasons one through three out. Season four should be out sometime in March 2011. You won't believe the difference between the shabby quality of the public domain episodes and the unbelievable quality of the official releases. It's like they were filmed a month ago. In addition you get great bonus features. So stop buying the same 30 episodes. I was fooled twice and decided to wait for the real thing.",1292198400,,615,4.811320754716981

7905871,4,B00000DC9Q,"Alpha, the most venerable of all the budget-priced DVD companies, recycles the same old episodes of THE LUCY SHOW that have fallen into public domain limbo. Serious ""Lucy"" fans have probably purchased these eps over and over again, but the price is right for the casual viewers too.

Five years after the last episode of ""I Love Lucy"" aired, Lucille Ball was back at CBS, sans Desi Arnaz (whom she had divorced by this point) for another shot at sitcom success. THE LUCY SHOW cast Ball as Lucille Carmichael, a widow who lived with her best friend Vivian Bagley (Vivian Vance) and their respective children in a large house in upstate New York. The show was later re-tooled, with Lucy moving to California to work as a secretary for bank manager Mr. Mooney (Gale Gordon).

Episodes:

""Lucy Gets Trapped"" - Skipping work to attend a big department store sale, Lucy's perfect plan goes up in smoke when she's pictured in the following morning's paper...

""Lucy and the Substitute Secretary"" - Lucy's vacation to Lake Arrowhead will just have to wait, when her temporary office replacement (Ruta Lee) plans to stick around longer...

""Lucy, the Babysitter"" - Mooney clamps down on giving Lucy a raise, so she decides to bring in some extra money by babysitting.  But her first clients turned out to be a real handful.

""Lucy and the French Movie Star"" - Sent to the apartment of a handsome French actor (guest star Jacques Bergerac) on bank business, Lucy drinks too much champagne.

""Lucy Meets Sheldon Leonard"" - When Sheldon Leonard uses the bank as a location to shoot a TV pilot, Lucy mistakes him for a real gangster.",1283126400,,1620,4.760714285714286

7905875,3,B00000DC9Q,"Beware I previously bought the same dvd but was in a different package. It comes as ""The Lucy Show 30 episodes on 3 dvd's"".  It has a picture of her face and is in red trim.  It is poor quality, but still enjoyable.",1204070400,8,215,3.9767441860465116
7905876,5,B00000DC9Q,"Lucille Ball teams up with two of the other great comedians from the early days of television and a teenager heart throb in this trio of episodes from ""The Lucy Show.""  First, in ""Lucy and George Burns"" (#111, September 12, 1966), George Burns visits Mr. Mooney at the bank to get his dividend statement. There he encounters Lucy and decides to make the wacky redhead the new girl in his act. Their opening night is a smash success and Lucy has to decide between a career in show business or staying at the bank. Then, in ""Lucy Meets the Berles,"" (#133, September 11, 1967), Lucy receives some time off from the bank to be a temporary secretary for special client Milton Berle. While Mr. Mooney enjoys peace and quiet at the bank, Lucy overhears Berle discussing a love scene with Ruta Lee and assumes the two are having an affair. This one contains the priceless sight of Thousand Island dressing dripping down Berle's face. This episode is one of the few rare but choice times the King and Queen of Television Comedy appeared together. This videotape offers as good a pair of episodes from ""The Lucy Show"" as you are going to find.  Finally, we have Frankie Avalon guest starring as Tommy, the nephew of Mr. Cheever in ""Lucy, the Starmaker"" (Episode #136, October 2, 1967).  Lucy is supposed to show Tommy the ropes at the bank but when she learns he is a singer she arranges for a producer to stop by the bank and discover the boy.  Avalon gets to do a couple of numbers in this one.  The Burns and Berle episodes alone make this a first rate collection.  These episodes are introduced by Milton Berle and the tape also includes the theatrical trailer from Ball's 1943 movie ""Best Foot Forward.""",994809600,,1698,4.569078947368421
