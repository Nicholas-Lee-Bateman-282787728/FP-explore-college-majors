416425,4,630203082X,"Home for the holidays is a great little horror, suspense film with a Christmas, family homecoming setting. Sally Field is very young, and surrounded by more mature and experienced actors but really manages to hold her own. Eleanor Parker and Julie Harris give excellent performances as well and this little gem will hopefully find it way to DVD in the very near future. From there it will quickly add to its considerable cult following. I can't believe it hasn't already been released on DVD. Don't miss this film and don't forget the popcorn.",1002672000,14,543,4.849462365591398

7819927,3,630203082X,"Home for the Holidays is a 1972 American made-for-television horror film directed by John Llewellyn Moxey, produced by Aaron Spelling and starring Sally Field, Eleanor Parker, Julie Harris, Jessica Walter and Walter Brennan which premiered on ABC on November 28, 1972. The plot focuses on a wealthy father on his deathbed who invites his four daughters home for Christmas and tells them he suspects his second wife of poisoning him. Shortly after, the girls learn that their stepmother was accused of killing her first husband, and they begin to fall prey to a killer dressed in a yellow rain slicker.

If you are a fan of any of the cast it is worth a look but don't expect a great film",1490227200,,687,4.677685950413223
7819928,5,630203082X,"What an unexpected holiday treat, or quasi holiday treat to see my favorite actress the great Eleanor Parker and the other great Julie Harris both in one film. You can only expect the best. Sally Field is cute here and does hold up to the other two veterans but it is Sally Field, a/k/a The Flying Nun--although time will tell otherwise.  Suspenseful, I won't give away the plot as I don't want to spoil it for others, but oh, so worth it.  I downloaded it from YouTube and play it on my VLC media player--for free. Enjoy it, not your usual Christmas story.",1465776000,,557,4.398058252427185

7819931,5,630203082X,"Before Michael Myers terrorized his sister with a kitchen knife on Halloween and before Pamela Voorhees tried to avenge her son Jason's death on his Friday the13th birthday by maiming every camp counselor within a mile of Crystal Lake, there was Home For the Holidays, the very first indication of a whole new genre: the horror slasher film.

The amount of talent in the cast and the cinematography is insurmountable by any standard of the day and though it's a made for TV film, it rivals anything that came out in theaters at the time.

This comes from a time where anything that Aaron Spelling put his name on turned to gold, and perhaps Home For the Holidays is his best example.

The plot: It's the most wonderful time of year (for killing, apparently) and a father is convinced that his second wife is trying to do away with him by slow poisoning, and he seems to have ample evidence he might be right, since she's suspected of killing her previous husband. He gathers his estranged and highly imbalanced daughters together and tells them she must be stopped, even if it means that they band together to kill her.

The acting of the women in the cast (Jill Haworth, Sally Field, Jessica Walter, Julie Harris, Eleanor Parker) is impeccably perfect as is the great Walter Brennan as the dad and there are plenty of horror movie stereotypical elements like thunder and lightning crashing after someone just completed a powerful statement or presented you with a valuable clue. Every bit of evidence along the way seems to lead to the nefarious stepmother, but alas, you find eventually that there is someone else with a different motive all their own for killing off the family members one by one by drowning and by pitchfork. The soundtrack is pitch (no pun intended) perfect in its suspenseful tone and sets a proper scary scene all by itself before the actors even have time to react.

If what you're looking for is a great film that quite literally reinvented the horror movie, wait till dark and turn out the lights, wrap yourself in your best comforter, plop down on the shag rug in front of the tv, grab your largest mug and fill it with egg nog and prepare for one of the most entertaining holiday themed slasher films of all time, Home For the Holidays. Just don't expect to hear any Perry Como or Carpenters Christmas carols. 5++stars",1407542400,2,2347,4.659420289855072

7819933,5,630203082X,"I was 17 years old when I first saw this movie and it has stayed in my mind all these 42 years!  I was only able to latch onto an EP VHS many years ago and that was barely watchable.  For the past 10 years, I have searched everywhere for this movie to be released onto a DVD and I found it today -- hiding in plain sight!  It was on a ""30 Movie Horror Collection"" by Echo Bridge Home Entertainment, making this movie only 43 cents!  The quality is excellent and well worth the $13.00 for the collection, as many of the other movies included aren't too bad. I can't believe I passed by this horror movie collection many many times without noticing that Home for the Holidays was shown right on the front cover.  If you're like me and are searching for this movie, look for it in those horror film collections at either Wal*Mart or Target.  Good luck!",1390348800,,849,4.24223602484472
7819934,5,630203082X,"Made in 1972 for ABC, Home For The Holidays is a wonderful tv movie that really does deserve a dvd release.

The film centers around four sisters who are invited home by their sick father for Christmas. He soon tells them he believes his wife is trying to slowly poisen him and wants his daughters to get rid of her, but soon enough someone is slowly picking off the sisters! Will anyone survive the holidays?
Home For The Holidays is a pure proto slasher, and man is it a good one! A killer in a raincoat walking around with a pitchfork, a suspenseful chase scene in the dark woods during a rainstorm, red herrings etc, it's all here! Of course being a tv movie the film is bloodless, and being 1972 the bodycount is small, but the film is extremely effective and has a couple good twists and turns to keep you guessing. Sally Field is great here. She plays the sweet final girl extremely well, and the rest of the cast including Jessica Walter do fantastic job themselves! Sure the film has one or two soapy moments, but when a tv movie is this good it's easy to overlook.

Like I said Home For The Holidays is in a desperate need of a dvd release. It truly doesn't deserve to be lost in time. So find yourself a copy, make some nice hot chocolate, grab a blanket, and watch Home For The Holidays!
A great movie.",1372291200,3,1314,4.315789473684211
