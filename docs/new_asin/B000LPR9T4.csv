Everyone agrees...it's probably one of the best movies of the year, and so much fun. Anyone who loves baseball will adore this movie.",1193529600,,254,4.543478260869565
2712247,5,B000LPR9T4,"In the early days of organized baseball, a great majority of players were Irish immigrants looking to become Americans by playing the ""national game"" of their new country.  Now over a century later the game has finally crossed the pond - or at least it's trying to.  This documentary captures that attempt in all its trials and glory.  If you are a baseball fan of any kind, I highly recommend getting this DVD.  The baseball itself may not be great (or even good) - but that's not the point.  The joy and excitement of the players is truly inspiring.  NYIrishGuy highly recommends this DVD.",1193184000,,591,4.634615384615385
2712248,5,B000LPR9T4,Being a huge baseball/Red Sox fan all my life. This film is a must see for any baseball fan or any sport fan. It is a remarkable baseball story of a group of Irishman trying to bring baseball to the emerald Isle. I would call it a cross between Bull Durham and The Van.

2712249,5,B000LPR9T4,"I have now seen this film a number of amount of times and I can say I have not seen it enough. I first saw this film in the opening in Los Angeles a few years with the film maker and the skipper. Of course being an Irish Mexican and seeing that I am not the only one made me appreciate the film even more. Buy this movie, buy many copies. I hear John is working on a new film that has everyone's fav manager Wally ""Has any one seen my line"" Backman and the rest of the league. Can not wait.

2712250,5,B000LPR9T4,"This is one of the best baseball documentaries I have ever seen,..Seriously this film is awesome!! To Actually to hear those rosy cheeked little boys, (and girls),talk about baseball in that Irish accent was just Inspiring. As a kid, You see the game here in the states and you grow up with it as well, but over there these kids are starting from PAGE ONE!!!  and to see them so excited about learning this new game, well it gave me goosebumps!!
Then to see the actual Irish National team grow as well.. just a great piece of work..If you love baseball, (and Ireland!!),you really should see this!",1193097600,,597,4.579439252336448
2712251,5,B000LPR9T4,"I grew up in an Italian/Irish household to a family of baseball fans.  As both an American of Irish ancestry and a lifelong fan of baseball, I would cite this film as one of the most entertaining and informative pieces available.  I would recommend this DVD to any fan of baseball, whether or not you are of Irish heritage.  Much like Kevin Smith (of Clerks fame), the creators of this film maxed out their credit cards and spent a large amount of their own money to bring you this film.  After having watched it, I can say that not only was it worth their money, it is most certainly worth yours.  Check it out.",1193097600,,612,4.333333333333333

2712253,4,B000LPR9T4,"It was interesting to learn that an american made this film and maxed out his credit cards. Also to learn that they
don't have many sponcers, because baseball is no longer an Olympic sport. Most of thier money and players
are from America. If you have Irish decent you can be on the team.",1189900800,,288,4.351851851851852
8163390,5,B000LPR9T4,"This documentary reminded me of my own boyhood. Of growing up in an Irish neighborhood in the north Bronx. Of playing stick ball in the school yard, and little league on sand lots. Playing our national past time was for many of us, who were the children of immigrants, part of our quest towards assimilation. It was in a way I can't fully explain about being an American. Where my father had dreamed of playing hurling in Dublin's Croke park, I day dreamed of playing in the Cathedral of baseball that was the old Yankee stadium.",1500249600,,529,4.520833333333333

8163394,5,B000LPR9T4,"What makes this truly special, to me, is that it's ultimately about the triumph of the human spirit.  Baseball wasn't even a cult sport in Ireland not that long ago.  Gaelic football and hurling are the national pastimes there, while soccer ranks a solid third in popularity.  Baseball?  Not even a blip on the radar when a group of young men decided to try organizing it as a club sport in the 1990's.

""The Emerald Diamond"" is at its core a story about how a few guys with a dream of playing a game totally foreign to their homeland are able to persevere through limited success and even more limited funds to create something with its own stark beauty, like Ireland itself.  You can just see the love of the game and the pride these men have in playing it, especially those representing their country.  This really matters to them, and Fitzgerald has created a film that viewers just can't help being drawn into...it's a VERY human story.

An absolutely worthy DVD to own, especially for American baseball fans tired of steroid scandals, overpaid and inaccessible players and going to ballparks where they're treated to incessant commercials on the PA system, high prices for everything (even water) and the overall feel that they're being ""sold"" something.  You get none of that here:  It's baseball at its most basic and innocent stage as played by guys who truly have a child's love for the game.",1327104000,,1402,4.709016393442623
8163395,4,B000LPR9T4,A solid documentary. Very entertaining to watch the team's eveolution. What some guys will go through just to play the game. Irish pride shines throughout.,1268438400,,155,5.24
