For Joyce Meyer fans this is a great lecture series. She talks about tearing down the strongholds in your mind that keep you in bondage.

Even if not a factual truth her idea is that if the enemy gets you to believe an untruth then that becomes a truth in your mind.

Joyce is a good speaker that I get a lot out of when I hear her speak. I really respect her very much.",1489881600,3,503,3.7264150943396226

Idk, if Joyce applies this believes or if she is vocalizing something that is gonna have mass appeal.

I mean, she has more money than God. HAHA. I think her assets total near 100 million.

Is she a business women or an actual perfect Christian who her applies her teachings the way she vocalizes?

3766231,5,B001QMCJ1E,"""Being positive is so powerful."" ~ Joyce Meyer

Joyce Meyer is an amazing communicator who has learned how to think positive thoughts on purpose. This has brought her joy and in this DVD she has much wisdom to share. She talks about how we should not just let our minds run rampant and that we should choose thoughts carefully.

This DVD is essential viewing if you have trouble with your thoughts, especially negative thoughts about yourself or other people. Joyce Meyer explains how we are poisoning ourselves with jealousy, criticism and judging others. She also talks a bit about anger and explains the way to stop thinking bad thoughts.

If you are looking to transform yourself this is a good place to start. I know what Joyce Meyer says is true because thinking positively had helped me tremendously in my life as well. What I loved about this DVD is that everything Joyce Meyer talks about is based on biblical truths. She really knows her Bible and brings attention to key Bible verses that could change your life for the better.

The topics include:

What's been on your mind lately?
Thinking your way out of bondage.
What would Jesus think?
Think about what you are thinking about!

3766265,5,B001QMCJ1E,"I had to overcome a few things to even listen to Mrs. Meyer, such as being taught that women are not to be preaching the Gospel, her direct spiritual tap on the knuckles approach and bringing up contraversial subjects.  More than once I changed television channels.  However, a more greater authority than me urged me to stick with watching her inspite of my unwillingness.  When she talked on the subject of spiritual warfare, via Battlefields of the Mind, she struck a homerun & touchdown with me.  I needed to hear that message.  I was so impressed I purchased the book and the DVD.  She has the gift of not only great oratory, but a tremendous amount of common sense derived from hard fought experience which she is able to get across to her Middle Class audiences.  If you do not have a clear mind's eye about spiritual warfare & how the devil tempts you, this would be a very helpful companion to the Holy Bible.",1354492800,36,918,4.527272727272727

3766270,5,B001QMCJ1E,"After reading the through chapter 15, this book has truly been a blessing to me. I am very excited at how God continues to keep Joyce Meyer Ministries relevant throughout this 21st Century. This book is very honest in addressing what we think about as fallen humans who need the Saviour (Jesus Christ) to save us and the Holy Spirit to renew our minds. This book highlights lazy patterns in the mind and forces one to digg deep inside the Scriptures and question is the Mind renewed? I enjoyed this book and will continue to read it at least once a year. This process of renewing the mind is a lengthy process but with God everything will work out according to His Will and Purpose. This book also highlights the root cause for depression, anxiety, and worry; ""ITS ALL IN THE MIND."" So, Guard Your Mind-Always.""With that being said, I recommend this book to any and everyone who can access this book. It will bless you in a mighty way. God's Word will speak to you. You just gotta listen closely.",1340755200,,996,4.50828729281768

3766272,5,B001QMCJ1E,"I was very glad and happy that I could find this teaching dvd on Amazon as such a good price.  We at my Sunday school class sometimes study from well know publicised authors such as Joyce Meyers.  Since I  have eye problems and it is hard for me to see good enough to read, the video was the next best thing for me.  I was happy to be able to find a used one on Amazon at such a good price.  The information that the DVD was in excellant condition before I submitted to buying it was very important.  It would have been a real disappointment if it was flawed.  It works beautifully and it has been a great help .  Thanks",1318464000,,620,4.024590163934426
3766273,1,B001QMCJ1E,I  thought  that  Joyce  Meyer  would  be  lecturing  on 5  CDs  instead  the  real  author  of the  book supplied  the  auditory  information.  I  think  that  it  is not  honest  advertising  to  promote  Joyce  Meyer  when  she  is  only  featured  as an  individual  who  introduces  the  CDs.,1317168000,3,297,4.608695652173913

3766282,5,B001QMCJ1E,"This DVD is of Joyce Meyer teaching to a live audience.  It is terrific to use alone or with the book or a study guide.

The DVD is 214 total minutes, broken up into four teachings around 50 minutes each.

Teaching titles are:
* What's Been on Your Mind Lately?
* Thinking Your Way Out of Bondage
* What Would Jesus Think?
* Think About What You Are Thinking About

Joyce Meyer appeals to a wide audience because she laughs at herself and is vulnerable in front of the camera.  She has been distracted in her mind and has been curt with people and done other sins just like the rest of us.  She isn't preaching down to anyone, and makes the subject very clear and easy to learn or follow.

She does not preach only to women, and does not put down men or anyone in order to look better herself.  This is a great series to view and review more than once a year to remind yourself and check yourself on where your thoughts are leading you.  One of her favorite sayings about this study series is, ""where the mind goes, the man (person) follows.""

This is the first series of hers that I have watched, and I highly recommend it for all ages.  Good for studying alone or as a group.  Great for teaching teens (and anyone) how to control their minds and thoughts and not just be controlled by what's outside--TV, ipods, texting, video games, what others say.  She helps you laugh at yourself as you learn to be still and think thoughts on purpose.  Highly recommended--two thumbs up!",1288224000,59,1477,4.362637362637362
