Showcases the whole team

Good Andy Macdonald Footage

Amazing Steve Caballero Tricks

Bad things about this video:

The video is too short for the large number of skaters on the team.

Not enough bonus Footage

The good outweighs the bad, so overall this is a good video. 4/5 stars!!!",1323820800,,316,4.7407407407407405
