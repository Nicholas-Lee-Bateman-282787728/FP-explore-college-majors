4048320,4,B003156IIY,I gave this to someone for Christmas. They were very excited to receive this.  I did not view it myself.,1358985600,,104,4.2
4048321,1,B003156IIY,"That this series was, and remains, funny to many is a sad commentary on a society that finds abuse to animals acceptable.

Consider my one star rating . . . a minus one star!",1320624000,2,174,4.117647058823529
4048322,5,B003156IIY,"I love the Dogville comedies. They are cute, silly, and fun to watch. I wish they would have made more of them. One of my favorite scenes is the doggy chorus line.
Ahahahaha. I recommend this collection to anyone with an open mind and a sense of humor.",1298592000,2,252,4.270833333333333
4048323,5,B003156IIY,Great product!  Highly recommended if you are interested in these old videos.  They are a very entertaining and interesting glimpse into a world long gone.  Very funny too!,1297296000,,172,5.071428571428571

""This product is manufactured on demand using DVD-R recordable media. Amazon.com's standard return policy will apply.\r\n

Maybe this was added after you bought yours.
The problem with most shorts series is they are too much of a good thing to watch in a sitting. View one or two before a feature over many weeks and you will have more fun.",1294876800,2,550,4.6020408163265305
4048325,4,B003156IIY,"The good: the videos themselves are great, and recommended.

The bad: despite what the description says, this is not a standard DVD.  It won't play on computers, but will most likely play on your DVD player.  It's basically an inherently defective disc that most DVD players will play anyway, but one of the shorts wouldn't play right on two different DVD players.  Is it a problem with the burning process, or a problem with the poor attempt at DRM? Especially considering the price of the 2-disc set, I'd expect an actual working DVD.  Since amazon doesn't give a warning about this not being an actual DVD, feel free to buy it, watch it, then return it.  After all, you paid for a DVD and received less than a DVD.  Also, who knows if whatever devices we're using 5 years from now to play DVDs will play this.  I'm not even sure if your typical blue ray player will play this, so buyer beware.",1271030400,9,896,4.45398773006135
4048326,5,B003156IIY,"Okay, in the middle of the night I woke up (finding I had left my TV on) to one of the Dogville shorts on.  I was somewhat shocked and dumbfounded by the ridiculousness I was watching!
I searched the TCM website to find out just what I had seen, and it was one of these shorts.

This a 2 disc set, and it's chock full of the silliest, strangest shorts ever.  All dogs, voiced over.  These dogs are REMARKABLY patient!  They are always dressed up to fit the short subject, and sometimes (particularly the college football team) you can pretty much see the wires that are helping the dogs to ""walk"" upright.

I DO absolutely recommend this set for any dog fancier, just be prepared for  bizarre and silly!",1265155200,6,703,4.403100775193798

4048328,5,B003156IIY,"I believe it was the running of an entire herd of animals off the edge of a cliff to their deaths for the sake of filming a Western that led to the humane treatment of animals in films. Remember these nine shorts were made in 1930 and 1931 - not last week. If you can do this, then they are hilarious. In case you've never seen these, the Dogville Comedies of the early 1930's spoofed popular movies with dogs as the actors. There was a ""Dogway Melody"", ""So Quiet on the Canine Front"", and ""The Big Dog House"", and ""Dog Tails of Morocco"" to name some of the others.

My favorite short is ""Hot Dog"", and it is basically a canine precode in which a female dog goes into a speak-easy and gets picked up by one of the male dog customers. She thinks her husband is away, but he shows up and interrupts the rendezvous. There is a fight, a shooting, and a dramatic courtroom finale, all spoofing precode film of the era in general. The reaction of people to these shorts has me wondering - in 80 years what films of today will shunned because of changing standards of what is considered decent and humane?

This set was released in September 2009, and Warner Bros. has a 90 day window in which they are the exclusive sellers of any Warner Archive product, of which this is one. You can buy this two disc set directly from them right now for 24 dollars. The shorts are unrestored and are on DVD-R. The audio has a little hissing - after all these are early sound shorts - and the video looks just fine, at least on my copy.

For you film historians out there, writing and directing these shorts  was Jules White's big break into the film business. The shorts were so popular that MGM allowed White to graduate to directing human beings - starting with Buster Keaton's ""Sidewalks of New York"". The film was a disaster because you can just imagine a creative force like Buster being ordered about by the autocratic White who had been directing canines for the last two years. However, White did rebound in the Columbia shorts department in the mid 1930's where he spent many years directing that studio's most successful comedy team, the Three Stooges.",1255824000,18,2142,4.456632653061225

4048335,5,B003156IIY,"I saw one of these shorts on TV --It was hilarious.  Back then, they probably didn't have any laws protecting animals in films like they do today.  The dogs are very cute and well trained.",1384819200,3,188,4.3428571428571425

8386657,2,B003156IIY,"If you love dogs,  it will be upsetting to watch these defenseless animals jerked around,  dragged back and forth,  and strapped down by wires and harnesses.  Their paws are wired down in obviously uncomfortable and unnatural positions. Some are clearly panting and barking  in distress (Dehydration? Pain? Overheating due to stage lights?).  This is an indictment of the ignorance about dogs and the cruelty of humans toward animals in  the 1930s. Thank heavens an abomination like this could never be made in the USA today. Wish I'd never bought this.  It's given me nightmares.",1488067200,,580,5.095744680851064
