4099687,5,B003A0T8BO,"1 Disc Widescreen, released July 20, 2010

""Entre Nos"" is based on a true story in which Paola Mendoza makes her amazing debut as writer/director/star of this film with the help of writer/director Gloria La Morte. Mariana has to find ways to provide for her family of two young children, Gabriel played by Sebastian Villada Lopez and Andrea played by Laura Montana Cortez after their father abandons them after they immigrate from Colombia to the U.S. where she barely speaks the language.

Years earlier, Mariana's husband immigrated to New York and she rejoins him with the kids to reunite the family. Two weeks later, he announces he is taking a new job in Miami and move there alone for a few months sending them money and then return. After a while, she figures out he will not be coming back and with rent due has to find a way to fend for herself and the children in a strange country starting with making empanadas and later collecting cans.

Mendoza's struggle and emotional endurance in this film is masterful. The two children are endearing and very honest in their characters. They try their best to help their mother but also need to have fun once in a while in order to keep the balance since they work all the time. This is a very well-done film that is inspiring to see what a person can accomplish when their back is to the wall.

Mendoza and fellow writer Gloria La Morte flawlessly capture the desperation of the family's situation, but even more importantly their closeness, desire to be together, and love for each other that manages to keep their spirits up even in the darkest of times. One of the saddest moments for me was Mariana's daughter, Andrea turning to her and saying ""You're not funny anymore"" and the dawning realization on Mariana's face that she quickly turned into a tickle fight challenge to ease Andrea's worries. Small moments like that abound in this film which consequently break your heart and warm it at the same time.

If you enjoyed Will Smith's journey in ""The Pursuit of Happyness "", you'll want to check this out because this is another case of everything being taken away gradually and trying to keep your family alive and together and rising to the occasion. Most of it is in Spanish with English subtitles.

Bonus Features:

There is commentary by Paola Mendoza who is the director, writer, and star of the film so she gives insight on all angles of the process one rarely gets in a commentary track. What is most amazing about this film is that it is actually Paola's mother's journey and she WAS the character of Andrea making this very personal for her.

Behind the Scenes actually gives a great inside look at the open call auditions, discussions with casting directors, and character directions that you don't see every day. She spent a lot of time playing with the children and getting more comfortable together so they would be loose enough for acting and did a lot in the rehearsal process. The production was made in about twenty days.

""How to make Empanadas"" is a cute little extra on the disc revealing that Paola Mendoza does not actually know how to cook and needs the help of director/writer Gloria La Morte as Master Chef to learn how to actually make these. If you have trouble following the process, the recipe is also available on their website. There is a PSA on Immigration Reform and it's easy to see why this movie ended up on Michael Moore's 20 ""Best Pictures"" of 2009 and the receipient of an Honorable Mention at the Tribeca Film Festival. If you enjoy Mendoza's work, another great extra is her short film ""Still Standing"" also on this disc.",1283817600,9,3621,4.663009404388715
4099688,5,B003A0T8BO,"I normally don't cry while watching films, but this film makes it hard to pull that off! The film has so much heart, so much emotion that its hard not to get involved and become one with the characters. The story reaches out to you and almost makes you want to become a part of it. This is one of the best independent films that I've seen and it deserves all the credit that it can get.

Paola Mendoza's performance in this film is exceptional. I'd previously seen her in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/On-the-Outs/dp/B000OSBUT8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">On the Outs</a>&nbsp;and thought she was good in it, but her acting is on a different level all together in this film. The two kids, Sebastian Villada & Laura Montana, play the characters of Gabriel & Andrea so well. Along with the story, the casting and most importantly the acting are the strong points of this film. Once can only imagine the kind of directing that must have gone into this film to bring it all together and make it work so well.

I personally give this film two thumbs up and highly recommend this film!",1281312000,4,1123,4.968085106382978
4099689,5,B003A0T8BO,"A simple, honest, heartfelt film, without the bells and whistles of a big budget Hollywood flick, Entre Nos tugs at your heart in more ways than one. Its strength lies in the universality of its story - of every man or woman who has had to face the struggle of survival, and that it is possible to do so with strength, grace and the single minded belief in humanity and goodness that exists around us. This film moves beyond culture, race, language and goes right to the core of humanity, something we can all relate to, no matter where we come from or what language we speak. Deeply moving and inspiring. You won't be disappointed!",1277510400,,632,4.504347826086956

The fact it is based on a true story gave me tingles. The story grabs you from the start, acting was really so amazing and heartfelt, direction was super and i just loved the cinematogaphy ~ really a good movie. Really a good recommendation!",1277424000,,704,5.467889908256881
4099691,5,B003A0T8BO,"Entre Nos is as much an American story as it is an immigrant story.  It mines the poetry, struggle, beauty, and ugliness that marks all of our lives, and it does so with quiet humility and grace.  While it may be easy to propagandize the film's message for political purposes, the emotional power is far more complex and interesting.",1277251200,,333,4.627118644067797
4099692,4,B003A0T8BO,"Despite being an immigrant story, Entre Nos has surprisingly little to do with United States immigration policies. Though released during a period where the debate over immigration reform seems to be reaching a fever pitch, Entre Nos manages to avoid any overt political commentary on the subject. For some, this will undoubtedly be to the movie's detriment; however, Entre Nos works *because* it doesn't try to tackle any larger issues. It is a simple film, unburdened by any need to Tell Us How The World Really Is, and it is that simplicity that makes the film work on such a human level.

From a technical standpoint the film may not seem like anything special, but triple-threat director/writer/leading actress Paola Mendoza manages to infuse Entre Nos with a striking and palpable sense of gritty realism. New York is presented as neither a sterling metropolis nor a grime-infested deathtrap; it simply exists, as unconcerned with the main characters' plight as any random passerby. Speaking of Mendoza, it is her genuinely touching performance as Mariana that elevates the film to the level it is at. She is resilient and loving but also fearful and deeply hurt by her husband's betrayal; Mendoza tackles this emotional gauntlet like a seasoned veteran. Credit, too, must also be given to Laura Montana and Sebastian Villada - who play Mariana's children Andrea and Gabriel, respectively - as their performances are as equally real as Mendoza's, without the stiffness and wooden delivery that so often plagues child actors.

Entre Nos may not be for everyone. It's a sparse and quiet film that doesn't attempt to explain or solve the issues that surround immigration. However, in a time when the facts about immigration reform are frequently be boiled down to mere numbers and statistics, Entre Nos serves as a reminder that, for all the talk of stolen jobs and welfare exploitation, there is a human element involved that is all too frequently forgotten.",1276646400,32,1962,5.071207430340557

4099700,5,B003A0T8BO,"Hard to say that this film has much to say about immigration.  It is a very interesting and natural story about a mother and children who, abandoned by their father end up in the street.  While the existence is not wonderful, it is not completely sad.  A cynical mind expects so much darkness, but in the end one sees strangers reaching out when not much hope is expected.
Amazingly simple and I think unmanipulative, there is a certain beauty in watching a mother and children, never letting go of each other, the only promise that each day may offer.",1454457600,,552,4.555555555555555

I liked Paola Mendoza's performance as well as her two children.  I didn't think the movie was as strong as Maria Full of Grace but it has that same feeling of courage and desperation at the same time (and for anyone who understands immigration this will certainly hit home).  Overall, this movie is definitely worth checking out and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to see a good movie about immigration without getting into the politics of immigration.",1414368000,,621,4.722222222222222

4099717,4,B003A0T8BO,- and we were totally drawn in by the portrayal of grinding poverty.  The movie made us more aware than ever of what might be contributing circumstances of the people we see on the streets.  Our thanks to the movie makers who did this with an apparent grief and not an accusing stance.  The only reason I can't give five stars is because I thought the ending should have been handled with more development and less abruptness.,1394841600,,426,4.5064935064935066

4099719,4,B003A0T8BO,"Paola Mendoza gives us a hard look at the immigrant story, one told from her personal perspective. Her character arrives in New York City after following her husband to various cities in Colombia, her native land. Soon enough, he departs and disappears, leaving her with two young children, no money, and soon no place to live. This is a story we've seen before. However, what puts this one above the rest is Mendoza's acting. She gives the sincerity without becoming maudlin. She survives, learns, and to some extent prospers, albeit in a smile while. The direction is not flashy. It hones in on the characters, especially the young boy who manages to retain his dignity throughout the hard times. Life is never easy for people like these characters, however, Mendoza shows us how they make the best and most of what they have, especially their love. This movie deserves all the credit it has received.",1390176000,,903,4.832258064516129

With that in mind, I can relate to Mariana's issues with communicating her troubles in a film that is kind of heartbreaking to watch. I myself suffered eviction among many other traumatic scenarios and felt myself reliving those horrifyingly scary moments watching this movie. It is heart-warming with its light use of comic relief, but has its dark and serious moments, reminding us all that terrible things happen to good people. The fact that this is a true story is all the more validating, that the filmmaker(s) did not use any cheap story ploys to wrench out the tears that inevitably came on their own. Even tough old me who did not cry during ""My Sister's Keeper,"" ""The Notebook,"" and even ""Up"" found myself tearing several times... just a little...

It's a great story of the power of the human spirit, revealing a side of humanity never seen until a dire situation arrives on one's doorstep. A powerful drama, I recommend it to foreign film aficionados and those like me who prefer a real story to the crap Hollywood pumps out.",1355616000,,1307,4.757709251101321

Coming from a home with a single mother the movie struck a note with me. Those that were maybe in similar situations with a single guardian will connect with this movie. There are times when you are at the verge of tears, and then times when things seem awful and somehow the characters are able to find some bit of joy. I'd say it seemed pretty realistic.",1349827200,5,544,4.45

En el camino le tocan varias puebras que son muy duras, pero ella continua adelante.  Creo que Mariana representa a muchas mujeres latinas y madres solteras que hacen lo que sea para salir adelante con sus hijos.  Esta pelicula lo deja a uno con el mensaje de ser agradecido por lo que uno tiene, de admiracion por esta familia que lucho tanto, y le da uno un mensaje de reflexion.",1333238400,,551,4.219047619047619

She is resourceful and determined and you feel so glad to learn, in the end, that they rose well above their life on the street circumstances in the end.

Re being ""family friendly"", well, there is an abortion, but even if you don't believe in abortion (as I do not) you will probably find it hard to not feel compasson for the woman - she feels terrible about doing it, but is frantic about being able to take care of her other children.",1299369600,,675,4.291338582677166

It is the story of a young mother and her two children surviving their first summer in the USA after her husband abandons them. The movie is a lesson on solidarity as the two children cooperate with their mother even tough they are still very young. It is also a lesson in parenting as the mother never loses her mind or charges on her children as most stressed out parents do. The unconditional love among the three of them is a constant, the stability of this story. It is a movie with a happy ending because they managed to survive anyway, against all odds. It is an American story because only in America a mother of two young children is capable of getting on her feet without state or municipal assistance.",1299024000,2,856,4.35625
