8636559,2,B00HVTRDSA,"I almost gave this review 3 stars, but I think this should've been titled pentatonic blues/rock licks instead.  This does include tab, a pdf version.  So ignore what the other review said about that.  The Tab doesn't include what fingers are used for hybrid picking, that is a big downfall there.  That would've made it much more informative and make more sense for the subject of hybrid picking, but the tab is layed out like alternate picking lines with hammer-ons and pullofs.  There is a 5 minute or so video where he explains of when to use the hybrid picking, which he only uses the middle finger, I suppose that helps, but I thought it was a sort of lazy effort.  Only about 3 or more of these licks use string skipping, which is mainly when I like to use hybrid picking, which was disappointing.  Some people might use hybrid picking for the sound alone, in that sense you might like this DVD.  Don't expect groundbreaking licks that are related to hybrid picking.",1419552000,,972,4.578034682080925
