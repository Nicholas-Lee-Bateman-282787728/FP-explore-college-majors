8049755,4,B0007OY348,"A wide range of Irish music done by several groups/bands, one of young women.  Each band does an interesting introduction about their roots and group before performing.  Great music, the only drawbacks are poor stage lighting.  Otherwise, a great DVD of Irish music by bands/singers not usually found on the international scene (at least by me).",1215475200,,345,5.125
8049756,4,B0007OY348,"I really liked the last three groups, Border Collies for its wonderfully Irish folk music, Devana for its excellent three woman team of fiddlers and backup guitar, and Four Men and a Dog with legendary tenor banjo master Gerry O'Connor.  However, the DVD takes on a concert schedule that typically starts with ""warm up"" bands that are young, new or both.  That sequence of groups quickly led to me flipping through the rest of the tracks and groups to reassure myself about buying this DVD.  Four Men and a Dog close out the concert with some wonderful sets of reels, including an arrangment with two fiddles.",1133568000,16,609,4.726415094339623
