4010579,4,B002XTBE6U,"This is each of the 10 seasons of JAG shrink-wrapped together instead of one big box. My husband and I preferred that because we've found that big box sets are harder to store, often poorly packaged, and don't offer great extras in most cases. We also own all of the seasons of NCIS, so it's nice to finally own the pilot episodes for that show (which are in season 8, episode 8.20: Ice Queen and 8.21: Meltdown); we have both enjoyed the rest of JAG too, so we decided to get them all instead of just season 8.

The DVDs are in thinpack DVDs cases, one box per season, two DVDs per thinpack, 2-4 thinkpacks per season. The format varies because the first four seasons were broadcast mostly in 4:3 aspect ratio and then in widescreen (16:9) for most of seasons 5-10. Some shows from the 90s (which is when JAG started, with the first episode shot in 1995) don't look good on our big-screen HD plasma, but these looked sharp. They sounded good on our surround system as well (Dolby Digital).

At least right now, it's cheaper to buy these as a set than get each individual season, so this is a good deal that I would recommend! If you want to read info and reviews of each individual season (because, as I mentioned above, this is just the 10 individual seasons bundled together), go to the links below:

4010580,5,B002XTBE6U,"The first nine seasons were just wonderful. Forget season 10. The real JAG culture ends at season 9 with the Admiral's retirement. The Admiral was the soul of JAG.

The female counter part to Harm Rabb in season 1, Meg, was very pleasant, and we missed her throughtout the next 8 seasons. Mac was fine, but at times it was difficult to watch her with her abrasive behavior.

All in all, this is great entertainment.",1282521600,,415,4.52
4010581,5,B002XTBE6U,Glad to take advantage of purchasing the complete series of JAG. The set arrived quickly and in perfect shape-as it should being new. Have yet to watch any of the discs. I'm assuming the discs are in perfect shape as well.,1277942400,,222,4.439024390243903
4010582,5,B002XTBE6U,"This is truly the best series that is/was on TV.  When the entire 10 seasons were available I bought them through Amazon and just love the series.  Wonderful characters, interesting story lines, changing minor characters.  I only wish they would make either a ""where they are now"" movie or have some of these characters appear on NCIS on a regular basis.  Love NCIS as well and think it would be great to mix the two up on occasion.  Well worth the purchase, got tired of getting them from the library because I always had a long wait!  If in doubt, go ahead and purchase.  It will give you hours and hours of viewing pleasure.",1276560000,,627,4.447368421052632
4010583,5,B002XTBE6U,I'm just a huge fan off JAG and wanted this product. The service is okay and the price was okay for me too.,1273795200,,107,3.6956521739130435
4010584,5,B002XTBE6U,This is a great TV show and I recieved it fast even though I used the free shipping!!!,1273449600,,86,3.8333333333333335
4010585,5,B002XTBE6U,"I first ordered just Season 8 of JAG solely to get the pilot episodes for NCIS. I absolutely love the show NCIS and had already ordered all available seasons (1-6) of that show. So I get season 8 of JAG to get the pilot for NCIS and fell in love with JAG as well.

I ordered this complete series set and started at the beginning and soon found that I couldn't quit watching the episodes. The series is more addictive than chocolate -- and that's saying something! I am currently on season 6 (out of 10) and find myself wishing that they had made at least 10 more seasons of JAG. The hours spent watching these shows are wonderful. I feel that Mac, Harm, Admiral Chegwidden, Bud, Harriet, Yeoman Tynner, and all the rest are part of the family now. I can't wait to see Mac get rid of Mick, however!

The purchase and delivery itself were standard Amazon -- sterling quality and service! The product came exactly as promised and very quickly! I love Amazon.com and wish everything I order online was of similar quality and service...

Now...if only I could find another product that could give me the wonderful hours I am enjoying with JAG (and NCIS).

And the icing on the cake with JAG is that you can sit and watch episode after episode without having to worry about its appropriateness for all ages. No cringing over foul language or inappropriate violence, either.

I heartily recommend this purchase.",1273276800,,1404,4.577689243027889
4010586,5,B002XTBE6U,"JAG was a great television show and I've wanted to buy the complete series for a while now.  Trying to buy each individual season was going to be really expensive, so I never bought any of them.  When I found out that this complete series package was going to be released, I immediately added it to my wish list.  Maybe I am a bit impulsive, but I purchased this from Amazon the day it was released.  I have been in JAG Heaven ever since.

The package is really just a wrapped set of the individual season boxes, but this was not an issue for me.  The DVDs are placed, two per case, inside the thin DVD cases.  This is a very nice setup and it does not require a lot of shelf space.  The show was broadcast in 4:3 aspect ratio for most of the first 5 seasons, but it eventually does move to widescreen format.  So you get some episodes in 4:3 and some in 16:9.  The quality of the video is good and it looks nice on an up-converted 1080p LCD screen.  The audio is encoded as Dolby Digital, so all of the surround features are carried over.

Additionally, I have used RipIt on my iMac to make digital copies of some of the DVDs, and this has worked great.  So if you have portable devices that you want to watch JAG on, RipIt will convert these for you.

I am very happy with this purchase and I believe that Amazon's price for the entire series is more than reasonable.",1271635200,71,1369,4.175572519083969
4010587,4,B002XTBE6U,"The specs above say:

However reliving it again from the pilot episode to the end, minus all the commercials and on a large flat screen, was a great (and addictive) experience again. The series has been off long enough so that the episodes were fresh in my mind as I watched them again. There are a lot of well written story lines paying tribute to those who have fought in the Gulf and Afghanistan Wars.

4010739,5,B002XTBE6U,"I watched the price for a while and finally got this and it was worth it.  This was quality television and a nice refresh from the cop/lawyer/crime scene shows.  The early shows have a lot of clips of the F-14.  Nice to see if you are a TOP GUN fan.  Also interesting to see how the female characters were regarded in earlier seasons compared to the last few seasons, and even today.  Especially nice is not having 5 minutes of commercials between scenes so there is no break in the action.",1359244800,,490,4.34065934065934

4010742,4,B002XTBE6U,the series was delivered  well on time and looks great but the background music is SO LOUD compared to the dialogue that we literally have to readjust every time.. very annoying and interferes with the enjoyment of the show..not sure why this is happening which is why I only gave it 4 stars..,1357689600,,293,4.528301886792453

4010744,5,B002XTBE6U,"This was a good series.  I was a Navy pilot myself, but back in the Southeast Asia era and never flew anything else but the old Skyraider.  I did think at least one episode was pretty far-fetched involving Harm and Mac ""stealing"" a MIG, and surviving a missile strike.
It was also great to get a full ""new"" package.",1356134400,,315,4.322033898305085

4010747,5,B002XTBE6U,"JAG was an excellent series with good plot lines often reflecting actual events of the time.  The DVDs are well produced with clear video and audio. I enjoy the mix of topics:  a good military courtroom drama series dealing with legal issues in the US and abroad in both civilian and military legal realms. JAG's scripts largely reflect the military in a positive light but also point out some of the problems the military was dealing with during the 10 years of the series.  It is particularly strong in laying out the armed services' viewpoints in conflicts between the military and civilians both in the US and in countries around the world where we have military personnel.  Some recurrent topics were the plight of Viet Nam era POWs/MIAs, the stress of those actually in combat situations, and the role of politics and politicians and how that impacted the services' programs, for good or ill. The lead actors formed a very compatible ensemble cast which created solid development of their characters over the multiple years they were in the show. Add to that some good flying sequences and entire scripts devoted to stories on a carrier, or at a Marine base or other special locations, as well as in the JAG's offices, and you have a consistent show with venues that change often enough to keep the action fresh and interesting. Overall, JAG is a very enjoyable series which features high quality work by everyone involved.

A specific note: without revealing it for those of you who haven't seen it, I particularly like the way the series ended: totally appropriate to the 10-year sequence.",1350604800,,1597,4.835164835164835

4010749,4,B002XTBE6U,"Whereas diminutive Tom Cruise who has to walk around his sets on platforms so his leading ladies don't look down on him could be a pilot Milton Ontario Native David James Elliot is too tall by at least 6 inches to fit into the cockpit of most jets. The air force does not build custom 12 million dollar craft to fit their pilots. Finding a female partner he would not dwarf proved a problem despite a succession of two actresses in the part. Although the series is built around Harmon Rabb Jr. it stuck for 10 seasons on the strength of well-written parts for an ensemble cast. Throughout the producers enjoyed the co-operation of the military as shown in the opening credits of each show when a sub does an emergency blow literally jumping out of the ocean.

The series alternates between courtroom scenes, investigations in far-flung locations on land and sea, and on aircraft piloted by Rabb and others. One of the ongoing sidebars continued to be Rabb's search for Rabb Sr MIA during the Viet Nam War. Whereas Rabb's methods can be unorthodox, he even discharged a weapon in court, a black lawyer, Sturgis Turner is ramrod straight and by the book. The rolly polly Bud Roberts comes on board for comic relief but hangs around to become a serious contender in court.

This series displays a sufficiently changing mix of styles to keep it fresh and interesting. The courtroom scenes are more about a battle of wills than dry points of law and we get to see enough military toys to keep things exciting. I watched this initially on Television before buying the entire set.",1348444800,,1573,4.654676258992806

4010752,5,B002XTBE6U,"No matter who you are, JAG has something for you.
Catherine Bell and Nancy Chambers for the guys (sorry Mr. Elliot).
David Elliot for the ladies.
Tomcats, carriers and submarines for the younger crowd.
Drama, comedy and court room battles for the older group.
And probably the best theme music ever to be written for a series (except maybe Mission: Impossible).
This is an outstanding series and one of the few that portrays the military in an honest way.
A few bad ones but on the whole honorable, loyal and brave.
That's probably why it was cancelled. Hollywood hates to show military men and women in ANY good way.
I was very sorry to see it go so I am buying the entire series.
WELL WORTH the money.
Buy it. You will not be sorry.

4010838,4,B002XTBE6U,"JAG first of all is a great show.  It has good writing, (at least the first 8.5-9 Seasons.  The last season was kind of a wash, and disappointing to say the least.
To start, Harmon Rabb Jr. portrayed well by David James Elliott is a Navy Lawyer who was grounded because of night-blindness causing him to take a second career in the Navy as a JAG Lawyer. The actors in the show are all really good, but I have to say my favorite character from late season 1 to season 9 was the Admiral, A.J. Chegwidden, played by Johnathan M. Jackson.  He is a no-nonsense JAG (Judge Advocate General, for those that didn't know) but one that is very loyal to his people. Marine Major Sarah ""Mac"" Mackenzie, who did not come onboard till Season 2 played by Catherine Bell, Lt. Bud Roberts, played by Patrick Labyorteaux, and Ensign Harriet Simms, played by Karri Turner.  These people really made the show what it is, and when the Admiral didn't come back for the last season, it was a bit of a let down.  I read somewhere that the actor that played Chegwidden thought they could not do anymore with the character and that's why he did not return for the last season.  Makes sense.

There are plenty good episodes, from the early days of the First season with the unaired Episode of ""Skeleton Crew"" where we see Catherine Bell, but not as Mac, to the second and third seasons.  If memory serves, the third season had one of the best episodes called ""Wedding Bell Blues"" where Bud and Harriet get married.

Up until about Season 9, most episodes were really pretty good, but it did get quite hokey in the 10th season or late 9th.  It just wasn't the same without the Admiral, he brought so much to the table in the show.  But, like all good shows, it had to come to an end.",1311811200,2,1755,4.369230769230769
4010839,5,B002XTBE6U,This series is awesome i even got my mom into it cause she didn't even want me to buy it so it is well worth the money plus David James Elliott is hot. Plus there is so much suspense in all the episodes you'll scream it your TV.,1304812800,,228,3.7708333333333335

4010841,5,B002XTBE6U,"Great series! I saw many of the original broadcast episodes and welcomed the chance to see the whole series. After acquiring the complete DVD series and viewing the cliff-hanger at the end of season one (Skeleton Crew), I was initially disappointed that season two did not follow up on the cliff-hanger, but left it hanging. At first, I just dismissed it, since there were notes about that particular episode being ""rarely seen"". I thought it might just be an orphan episode cut from production. However, after some research I discovered that an episode in season three (Death Watch) uses flash backs and does get Harm mostly off the cliff. I thought I would provide this piece of trivia to help others avoid any temporary frustration with what seemed to be an incomplete story.

4010846,5,B002XTBE6U,"I am a JAG junkie.  In my view, JAG is the very best TV series EVER.  JAG had it all:  action, adventure, drama, mystery, intrigue, suspense, romance, and even an occasional touch of comedy and soap opera.  This COMPLETE set includes all 227 episodes including the final 1st season NBC episode ""Skeleton Crew"" which was NEVER originally aired, but was largely included with a different ending as a ""flashback"" in the 3rd (2nd CBS) season episode ""Death Watch"", A viewing will quickly make it apparent why, as does the bonus ""making of --"" feature.  Both the video and audio quality of this set is excellent, with original formats (4X3 in the first 4 seasons and 16X9 thereafter) preserved.  If I have any negative criticism at all it would be the packaging, which is simply all 10 individual seasons with their individual season boxes (usually 4 disks per season). I think that now that all seasons are available that they could have done a bit better with the packaging.  At any rate, I you love good TV, get JAG.
