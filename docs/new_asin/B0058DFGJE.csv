4598216,3,B0058DFGJE,"I have loved the Rockford files every since it came on TV in the 70's. I have all the
seasons on DVD. I only give this 3 stars because the pilot episode is not included on the DVD. I keep waitng for it to be released.",1340496000,9,217,3.739130434782609
4598217,5,B0058DFGJE,It's not a review unless you tell us how many episodes is included so we can make some judgement as to cost. I don't need a play by play of EVERONE who was ever a guest on the show.,1336435200,2,181,3.6666666666666665
4598218,4,B0058DFGJE,"I don't see why Universal feels such a need to make a complete series DVD box set of this popular 70's detective drama that ran on NBC from 1974-80, especially in todays struggling economy since all the individual season DVD box sets are already fine as it is.

Overall; the ROCKFORD FILES was a very sophisticated semi-comedy/drama like detective show about a bachelored pardoned ex-con now turned private investigator Jim Rockford(James Garner) who charged $200-per day, plus expenses who was often snookered by clients & often got beat-up by bigots, ripped off, burglarized, and sometimes even had his car racked up in the process, plus Rockford had his overworked police investigator buddy from the LAPD Sgt. Dennis Becker(Joe Santos)just like Rick & AJ Simon(Gerald McRaney, Jameson Parker)had their street-savvy cop buddy Det. Marcel ""Downtown"" Brown(Tim Reid)and then Lt. Abigail Marsh(Joan McMurtry)on SIMON & SIMON.

Therefore, Becker was often in hot water with his overzealous superior officers Lt. Diehl(Tom Atkins)and Lt. Chapman(James Luisi)for helping Rockford solve his cases with classified information and for allowing him to sometimes interfere with police investigations, plus Rockford's scheming ex-con buddy Angel Martin(Stuart Margolin)was always getting Rockford on a back-burner with his little scams, especially when crooks got screwed.

Additionally; my favorite character which was Rockford had his beautiful attorney girlfriend Beth Davenport(Gretchen Corbett)bail him out of jail and mischief in the first 4 seasons of the ROCKFORD FILES whole 6-year run on NBC, but had abruptly departed the series in the second half of Rockford's 4th Season since Corbett unfortunately left the show in the Winter of 1978, due to a salary dispute with Universal by making her last appearance in ""The Attractive Nuisance"" in January of 1978 leaving us to mourn the loss of Beth in the remainder of Rockford's 4th, 5th, and 6th Seasons.

Rockford also lived an eccentric lifestyle like Rick & A.J. Simon(Gerald McRaney, Jameson Parker)on SIMON & SIMON did since Rockford lived in a little ragged trailer in a parking lot in Malibu by the beach and kept his gun in a cookie-jar kind of like the short-tempered gonzo PI(Rick Simon)lived on a boat in the backyard of his often festidious kid brother private-eye(AJ Simon's)house in San Diego which was actually in Venice, but since Rockford didn't have an office, every episode would start out with a different message regarding bad news each time instead of having a leggy secretary answering the phone at a typical gumshoes office as opposed to the Simon Bros. being 2 brothers who ran a private-eye agency office together in Downtown San Diego and charged their clients $400 a day, plus expenses which was twice the going rate of Rockford along with the fact that Rockford's cash-flow problem was often a laugh.

Unfortunately, the ROCKFORD FILES was abruptly cancelled in the Winter of 1980 since James Garner had to quit doing the show in the middle of its 6th Season, due to James Garner having chronic back and knee problems which resulted in Rockford's 1979-80 Season being only a half-season just like the INCREDIBLE HULK's 5th Season was only an abbreviated season since CBS had abruptly cancelled the Hulk in mid November of 1981 after only showing its 5th episode for the season in the mid Fall of 1981, due to budget cuts and a change in management at CBS, despite the fact that the INCREDIBLE HULK's ratings were still going strong just like the ROCKFORD FILES ratings were still going strong during their sudden cancellations.

Therefore, age caught up with James Garner and he ran out of steam since health problems resulted in NBC showing Rockford's last episode ""Deadlock In Parma"" on Thursday January 10, 1980 in the middle of its last season, but the ROCKFORD FILES also inspired the premiere of newer private detective shows in the 1980's like MAGNUM, P.I. which made its debut on CBS in the late Fall of 1980 and SIMON & SIMON, which debuted on CBS in the mid-Fall of 1981.

Additionally; the premiere of much newer more shows like the DUKES OF HAZZARD was also blamed for this shows cancellation since the ROCKFORD FILES started getting a slight decrease in ratings when the Dukes made their debut on CBS in the Winter of 1979 due to the ROCKFORD FILES 9PM time-slot on NBC conflicting with the DUKES OF HAZZARD'S 9PM time-slot on CBS which resulted in Rockford losing a lot of viewers thru the Dukes, especially since Bo and Luke Duke(John Schneider, Tom Wopat)were a lot younger & better looking than Jim Rockford(James Garner)was and had a lot more spunk and energy than Rockford did too since Rockford was getting tired, huffing and puffing and dragging along with numerous ailments while the Duke boys were just humming along with zero ailments.

Therefore, the DUKES OF HAZZARD was soaring in the ratings at an all-time high at the peak of its whole 7-year run on CBS since the DUKES OF HAZZARD was still in its honeymoon-phase of the show while the honeymoon-phase of the show for the ROCKFORD FILES was already long gone with the Dukes basically beating Rockford to a pulp in the ratings department with Rockford unable to compete with them.

Many guest actors and actresses who appeared on the show over six seasons were wonderful. But this set is priced too highly at $231.38, when individually you can buy the six seasons for $140.40. I don't care if this set includes the movies; I would rather buy six seasons separately.
