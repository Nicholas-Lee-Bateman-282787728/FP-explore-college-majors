2384398,2,B000ACCLZK,"The audio is very good but, the quality of the video was terrible.  Not worth the $$$ I paid.",1152057600,7,93,3.8947368421052633
2384399,4,B000ACCLZK,"My fellow reviewer above described this thing absolutely perfectly.  But as an MS victim myself, I DO so appreciate Slowhand, Page, Beck, et al, playing a tribute to ex-Face, Ronnie Lane (who died of MS some years later.)  Unfortunately, I do have to force myself to try to do the impossible and just tune out Ray Cooper making a transcontental fool of himself, WAY ""over the top"" on percussion; however, as a long time Rolling Stones fanatic, I just smile WIDELY, seeing/hearing Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts as part of the rhythm section here.  I would say that THEIR presence alone justifies the price of this, but the fact that this concert was done for a MS sufferer and, really, to bring the public attention to/about MS, makes this DVD almost...sublime.  And now that I actually own the DVD and can view it at my leisure, I, even more, have to say: Thank you guys, and may God Bless ALL of you! RIP, Ronnie. Doggone shame that Avonex wasn't available back then.",1146787200,17,967,4.604651162790698
2384400,3,B000ACCLZK,"This will be a quick review.  The concerts were great - especially Jeff Beck.  If you are here because of Jimmy Page - warning!!!!.  Buy only if you want to see a full blown train wreck.  When this concert was booked the idea was to have Page, Beck, and Clapton be on the same stage.  But let me tell you something - Page was not there -  he was still suffering from the ravages of his heroin addiction.  He is so sickly looking - ashen colored, sweating, NO teeth, skinny and totally unable to play the guitar. He did an instrumental version of Stairway and it is horrible; he even totally butchers the solo - butchers it!!!! It is staggering to see.  Page himself said in an interview years later that ""yeah, I saw the Arms footage - that was when I knew my life needed to change"".  There are many great performances.  I guarantee anyone who watches this and is a Zep fan you will gasp when you see him from the first moment he walks on stage.",1146096000,23,945,4.229050279329609
8077702,5,B000ACCLZK,"This is truly a great DVD set. There's a good mixture of arts, from old. Loved all of it. Would rec amend to all.",1349740800,,113,3.75
8077703,1,B000ACCLZK,"This DVD of the ARMS concert at the Royal Albert Hall 1983 was a real disappointment, the transfer was absolutely horrible and must have been made from a VHS tape. I have a laserdisc from the mid eighties that looks 90% better than this travesty. I didn't look at it until this weekend or I would have tried to get my money back. Don't buy it unless you have no other way of getting this wonderful concert event. The concert is amazing with the best of British Rock all playing together. Where else can you see all 3 Yardbird guitarists together? Too bad the transfer is so bad. Grainy, dark overly contrasted piece of crap.",1309824000,2,624,4.434782608695652
8077704,4,B000ACCLZK,"So the video quality isn't so great. The sound is acceptable and the content is excellent. Also, everyone on stage is a little loose and messy with their playing. But it really just adds some character to the liveness. Just seeing all these guys on the same stage together makes this a worth while purchase. Any true fan of Guitar Gods should own this DVD.",1308096000,3,356,4.492307692307692
8077705,4,B000ACCLZK,"Thanks to a previous reviewer for finally mentioning the big white elephant in the room that lots of people haven't even noticed, let alone tried to ignore: Jimmy Page is obviously in an advance state of heroin addiction. Well, at least it should be obvious -- wake up, people! He's not merely rail thin here, but emaciated, and he visibly stumbles around the stage. His behavior is at times quite strange, and you can see the discomfort on Eric's face -- having been through this himself, he clearly knows what's going on. Some people have commented on him merely being a bit sloppy, but I'm just surprised he didn't drop dead right then and there. I always suspected Page would have been shocked at his appearance if he'd seen the footage, and it turns out, it's said that he was. Supposedly, it was a big catalyst for him to finally get cleaned up.",1285718400,3,851,4.568627450980392
8077706,4,B000ACCLZK,"Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page etc etc
If you like Rock Gods a must have. Quality is good, music is classic rock",1266019200,,117,4.130434782608695
8077707,2,B000ACCLZK,Can't complain about the concert. This DVD is a very bad copy from either VHS or a Laserdisc. Very dark and the sound has some sort of limiter that clips off any low volume content. Hard to enjoy this fine music with this version.,1244678400,2,230,4.25
8077708,5,B000ACCLZK,"Eric Clapton,Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page, Steve Winwood, Bill Wyman,Charlie Watts. It does not get any better.",1239667200,,104,5.5625
8077709,4,B000ACCLZK,Pretty good set from Beck and Page no real Meat and Patatoes from Clapton. Beck Focuses on his Material from the mid to late seventies. No tracks are any better then the Studio Classics. As for Page Prelude and Who's to Blame with Winwood on vocals are pricelees. Jimmy is wasted but far outplays the studio versions without a bad note. The rest of his set is sub par with City Sirens and A sloppy stairway to heaven. I exspected better from Clapton but this was a week stage in his career and it shows. It is sure worth buying for the Beck and Half of Page's set. Plus they play a few numbers together that have some good country syle lick's Via beck and Page again Clapton is asleep during these numbers.,1231459200,3,706,4.315789473684211
8077710,4,B000ACCLZK,"Have seen show live and from DVD, Was lucky enough to get 11 row seats at LA Cal show, was awesome , watching DVD brings back memories, Have to agree Page was Sloppy, But he always is or was onstage, In LA  Page and Paul Rogers(Bad Co.)worked together thus creating the band (The Firm) Page was much better in LA then London shows, I would say he was  still effected by the passing of John and his addictions, but was a good show, But hey  Jeff Beck blew them away and  hearing him sing no wonder he just lets his guitar do the talking",1221868800,2,535,4.115384615384615
8077711,3,B000ACCLZK,"The other reviews are dead-on in their comments on the relative merits of Beck vs. Page abilities; and its pretty obvious that it was a strain to their egos to get them both on the same stage.  Jeff Beck and Steve Winwood DVDs are hard to find, so if you're fan of either (even for the few songs) it's worth the price.  Eric Clapton gives a great performance but the sound mix leaves you straining to catch his guitar above the other instruments.  Another annoyance was the ""third drummer"" who mugged shamelessly and whaled on every piece of percussion - tambourine, cow bell, gong, drum rim shots, etc. - Eric, Charlie Watts and Kenney Jones can all be seen rolling their eyes at this over-the-top performance.",1167091200,7,711,4.626984126984127
