4483341,3,B004VLZTPU,"ordered season 1-3. season one and two played fine, we were hooked, this is an awesome show. i'm an old guy and thought i'd outgrown the biker-tough guy-hero thing, but i was wrong. then came season three, disc one started skipping and freezing in the first five minutes and continued. disc two was the same, as was disc three. Requested a replacement, which came within a WEEK; we were so happy! only to find this set of season three had the same problems. hard to describe how FRUSTRATED we were! we don't blame the merchants, but doubt if we ever purchase a product from fx network again.",1344211200,,591,4.5327102803738315

4483354,1,B004VLZTPU,"Each disc had visible dents and scratches.  When trying to view, the disc would freeze, and some of them would repeatedly flip on the screen.  They were impossible to view.

It was obvious that these discs were NOT inspected.

I took some of the discs to a video store and paid to have them polished, but they still froze.  I wasted that money, and the additional money I spent sending them back.  NEVER give them my business again.",1360195200,,432,4.4743589743589745

4483360,5,B004VLZTPU,"Kurt Sutter. The creator, writer and director or the show, has taken a classic story of betrayal, Hamlet and set it on top of a Harley Dynas, given it some leather cuts and created one of the best sagas on television that I have yet to see.

The cast, acting,sound track all are top notch. I read that sutter is intending to end the show by the seventh year. I know it seems selfish to say but would it be to much to ask if they extended another 7 years...yes it is actually that good that i could stand to see another seven years of the cast.

This series is worth 10 thumbs up.",1357084800,,579,4.0701754385964914

Disc #1 of season 1 was OK.  It is going to take some time for me to view all 3 seasons.

My wife refuses to watch this series, but I love it. Hope it lasts for a few more seasons. I think personally they could have gotten a better guy to play the part of Jax, but it is what it is, now, so I've accepted him as the upcoming bad a-- of the club. He just doesn't look like the typical biker to me. Anyway, its a great show. Keep up the good work guys and gals!",1346371200,,507,4.1313131313131315
