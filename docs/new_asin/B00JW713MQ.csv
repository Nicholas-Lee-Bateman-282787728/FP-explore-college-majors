8654162,4,B00JW713MQ,"My wife and I really liked this concert from Sao Paulo. Two aspects stood out. The audience was considerably younger than many of Rieu's European audiences, which leads to the second aspect: The audience was more spontaneous and enthusiastic that many of Rieu's audiences. The program itself was typical Rieu with a few Brazilian songs added to the program. If you are new to Rieu, then the concert might merit 5 stars, but we own over 15 Rieu DVDs so we've heard most of the songs several times over. If you enjoy this video, we recommend Cortona Italy (no. 1 for us), Schonbruhn Vienna, Australia, and Radio City Music Hall.",1435017600,,626,4.7
