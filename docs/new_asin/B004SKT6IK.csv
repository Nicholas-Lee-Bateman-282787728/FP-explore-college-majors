8439944,5,B004SKT6IK,"""Nippon Mukashi Banashi"" ~ ""Tales of Long Ago Japan"" When I was growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area in the 60's, these shows were broadcast by a local station from Fujii Terebi in Japan.  They were traditional Japanese folktales in a cartoon format.  The Japanese voices were kept and they were shown with English subtitles.  They were charming, authentic, not commercial, and simply wonderful.  I haven't seen them in 40 years, but I remember them fondly.  I have been searching for them for a long time without success.
I don't know about this DVD set.  It appears to be playable only in Region 2 - DVD players for the Japan region.
I wish they were playable in the US and I wish they were in Japaneses audio with English subtitles.",1355529600,,739,4.5606060606060606
