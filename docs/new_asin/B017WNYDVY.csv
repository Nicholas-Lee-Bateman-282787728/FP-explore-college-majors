8740880,5,B017WNYDVY,"I am impressed by the cinematography, blessed by the content, and humbled by how little I actually know about such an important subject in history. I've watched it four times and it becomes more and more impacting each time. I highly recommend this to any historian, christian, or person who is currently alive!",1453852800,,311,4.886792452830188

8740882,5,B017WNYDVY,"When I heard the initial announcement for the making of this film, I was very excited and hoped that this would be something that The Church could use to grow in her understanding of such weighty matters as this film presents. It was well worth the wait and did not disappoint!!!

This is an amazing tool for believers to use to engage each other and the unbelieving world with a discussion on the promises of God as well as a sober look at the reality of the history of the church and synagogue. The section about the history of the treatment of the Jewish people by the ""church"" is so very informative and is something that I hope every believer will learn about and grapple with.

There is also a lengthy section about Islam and how we as believers should carefully consider the events occurring in the Middle East today.

Not only is the content timely and well presented but the cinematography is stunning.

I am eagerly awaiting the next films in the series!",1451174400,,964,4.522988505747127
8740883,5,B017WNYDVY,"I must say I learned a lot about many different aspects of my faith and our forefathers in this film. I learned more about history and I was awakened to the gravity of the situations we at encountering today. The doctors, pastors, and missionaries all gave compelling and shocking information alongside beautiful film cuts around Europe and the Middle East. Such a compelling film about the Jews in Gods plan for salvation. The documentary is edited really well to tell a dynamic story from beginning to end that inspires you to educate, to learn, to inform, and to change. Two thumbs up.",1450742400,,588,4.7745098039215685
8740884,5,B017WNYDVY,"A MUST SEE!
God's covenant with the seed of Abraham is alive. Governments and the powers to be cannot change this fact*
An uncomfortable truth still remains to be the truth!
Thank you Dalton & team for shining a light onto a dark and hidden corner of history.",1450656000,,259,4.416666666666667
8740885,5,B017WNYDVY,"Chilling, provocative, informing, The Great Rage is an important film for the world, specifically Jesus' church, to see and experience.",1450569600,2,135,5.8
8740886,5,B017WNYDVY,This film is absolutely astounding and cuts to the heart of the matter when it comes to the mistreatment and hatred of the Jewish race throughout the ages. It communicates the dangerous deception of anti-semitism and anti-zionism with great effectiveness and poignant means. I cannot urge you enough to watch this film!,1450569600,,319,5.153846153846154
8740887,5,B017WNYDVY,"I can confidently say that I have not seen any documentary on the Jewish People/Israel (and I've seen quite a few) that so clearly and succinctly presents the history, present and future of the ""Jewish Question"" through prophetic and apostolic eyes quite as well as this film. Excellent interviews (of which so far there are 90 bonus minutes and counting), excellent location shooting, excellent production overall. Every Christian should see this film.",1450569600,4,453,5.305555555555555
