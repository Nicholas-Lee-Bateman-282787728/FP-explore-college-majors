This version from some company called ""Public Domain Flicks"" is said to be enhanced, whatever that means, but it even worse than the ""standard"" version. They took the standard DVD and did some heavy handed DVNR, making the image unwatchable. When the image is not moving it looks great, but as soon as the actors move it's total motion blur.
I hope some day someone will release a 35mm transfer. Maybe Image Entertainment or Criterion might take a chance on this great film. Until then no good quality versions is available.",1393113600,,689,4.702479338842975

8311166,5,B001IMJWVM,"Robinson Crusoe is a timeless classic.  I find this version to be among the best because of the underlying message that it conveys, ""shed the restraints of civilization and return to your roots.""  It seems a great message for today's youth as our economy crumbles under the weight of commercialism and over indulgence.  Steve Drexel (Douglas Fairbanks) sets off to recreate HIS civilization on a deserted island in the image of New York City.  He faces several challenges, including an attack by natives from a neighboring island who are acting at the bequest of the rivals of Drexel.  The lesson for the children takes a bit of a turn when Drexel escapes the island with a native women (Saturday played by Maria Alba) and returns to NYC with her on his yacht where she performs in the Ziegfeld Follies.  An almost complete reversal from the original intention to escape the modern world, Mr. Robinson Crusoe brings the uncivilized back...Ironic...",1228003200,3,948,4.930817610062893
8311167,5,B001IMJWVM,"This is a great film with Douglas Fairbanks.  Stranded on a deserted island because of a bet, Fairbanks character Steve Drexel intends to recreate New York City.  Almost Tarzan-Like, Crusoe befriends a dog, a monkey & a goat.  He eventually traps a native women played by Maria Alba and she becomes his love interest.  Those who bet against Drexel have no intentions of allowing him to win.  In one of the few black and white ""talky"" films of the time, Mr. Robinson Crusoe comes alive for the first time.  Check it out.",1225756800,3,519,4.586956521739131
