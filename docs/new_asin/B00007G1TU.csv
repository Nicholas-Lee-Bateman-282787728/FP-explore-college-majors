7975829,5,B00007G1TU,"Ys - Book Two continues where Ys - Book One left off (naturally), so if you haven't watched Ys - Book One, do so now!  Like Ys - Book One, I found this anime to be charming and exhilarating, with excellent pacing.  The same English voice cast is present and the satisfying conclusion to the story started in Ys - Book One is found here in Ys - Book Two.  The menu design is intentionally reminiscent of the original game, and the soundtrack still feels like it could be from the 80s, which is still a huge plus in my book.  This anime continues to give you a nice steady delivery of action and story, so none of the episodes feel like wasted material.

If you're a fan of medieval fantasy anime, or clean, older animation styles in general, this is definitely a buy.  Keep in mind, the Ys - Book Two dvd completes the story started in the Ys - Book One dvd, while the Ys II - Castle in the Heavens dvd starts a new story AFTER the events in Ys - Book Two.
So in chronological order, the story is:
1 - ""Ys - Book One""
2 - ""Ys - Book Two""
3 - ""Ys II - Castle in the Heavens""
I own all three dvds, and absolutely love them!",1425427200,,1120,4.0
