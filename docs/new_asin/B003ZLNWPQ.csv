8410576,2,B003ZLNWPQ,"The subtitles on this boxed set from DVD Version are so bad that you have to try to figure out what the translation means. (This was the fourth or fifth DVD Version release that I've bought that had incomprehensible subtitles.) I finally gave up and reluctantly threw it away. I bought the first two seasons at the same time and, luckily, the subs on Season 2 seem to be better. I should be able to watch that one. If I can find Season 1 from a different manufacturer, I'll try it again. But buyer beware of Bloody Monday Season 1 from DVD Version (and beware of their English-subtitled releases in general)!",1452297600,,608,4.486486486486487
8410577,1,B003ZLNWPQ,"The DVD was beautiful to watch, no problems---but whoever translated the subtitles into English never spoke the English language before.  If you cannot speak Japanese and you have not seen this movie with proper subtitles at least 10 times, then I do not recommend buying this.  I HAVE seen the movie at least 10 times but even so, my experience was ruined because I had to struggle to remember EACH conversation from past viewings to recall what was going on.  It was like reading a paragraph with half the words missing or in the wrong order.  Plus, lines were translated wrong!!  All of this made it a CHORE to watch.  And I had wanted this movie so badly...",1445299200,,661,4.559322033898305
8410578,4,B003ZLNWPQ,"The actors are attractive and well chosen for these roles; there are multiple characters that intertwine in this biological warfare plot on Japan, and the various scenes seem well put together as you are taken between various plots.  This dorama seems a bit less predictable than others which makes it all the more exciting.  The main reason for a 4 out of 5 stars is the subtitles.  For the dorama itself, I would give it a 5.",1393804800,2,427,4.51948051948052
8410579,4,B003ZLNWPQ,"I love this show so I'm happy just being able to watch it. If you just comprehend some japanese you won't be disappointed.

But I'd just like to mention that if you don't understand any japanese or haven't watched the show before or read the manga the english subtitle probably won't be good enough. It vary between slightly faulty, correct or completely wrong. At the last episode it was a bit off in the middle too.

To me it seems like a direct translation from the chinese subtitle (without anyone bothering to see if they're accurate) or translated by someone who speak neither japanese nor english fluently. Just a little tip^^",1336608000,5,633,4.693693693693693
8410580,4,B003ZLNWPQ,I really liked this drama. The DVD had a few mistakes in the subtitles and they were off a little but still understandable.,1301011200,2,123,4.391304347826087
