8467286,4,B005DOSCNA,"She Couldn't Say No may as well have applied to the pickle in which British actress Jean Simmons found herself when, unbeknownst to her, her contract with Rank Organization was bought out by RKO Studios and its maverick tycoon owner, Howard Hughes. Word on the street was that, even though she only had six months left in her original contract with Rank, Hughes threatened to ruin her career by sticking her with crap roles unless she signed with RKO for seven years. Rumor also had it that Hughes' interest in her was more personal than professional. But Simmons, married to then husband Stewart Granger, rebuffed Hughes' advances. I guess she could say no. But Hughes made her stint at RKO a living hell, that is, until they hashed it out in court, and Simmons' RKO contract was chopped down to two years and a run of three films. She Couldn't Say No was the last of the bunch.

At least, Hughes' unrelenting siege for her affections landed Simmons a dynamite femme fatale role in the Otto Preminger-helmed Angel Face, even if Hughes reportedly egged on Preminger to bully Simmons on the set. The third RKO film she made was Affair with a Stranger, of which we shall speak no more, thus re-consigning it to cinematic purgatory.

3.5 out of 5 stars for this one. She Couldn't Say No (a.k.a. ""Bella ma Pericolosa"" in some haunts) isn't as dynamic a movie as Angel Face. Shot in 1952 - only, Hughes kept fudging with it until its release in 1954 - She Couldn't Say No aspires to - but fails to achieve - the heights of them classic screwball comedies circa 1930s and '40s. The offbeat premise should draw interest: Grateful 21-year-old oil heiress Corby Lane (Simmons) means to repay an act of childhood kindness by lavishing her old hometown with anonymous gifts. Educated in England and thereabouts, it's a cinch that Corby's sure to go unrecognized, especially since she hadn't been to Progress, Arkansas (population: ""196 friendly citizens and 4 soreheads) since she was two years, two months old and in dire need of an operation, and the whole town pitched in to help save her life.

You can say Miss Lane - or ""Miss Johnson"" as she styles herself in Progress - is a meddlesome creature and naive and, okay, even a smidge condescending . Oh, but she so means well. The last thing she expect was for her largesse to have a detrimental impact on the community. See, Progress' is a rural society where life is lived simply and folks hardly ever lock their doors and things get done by bartering for goods or services. Corby Lane's generosity upends this equation. Lands sakes, you can't just throw money around like that.

Robert Mitchum plays the local and eminently practical sawbones, Dr. Robert Sellers, him what tries to cool down Corby's zeal, but I guess if he'd had success, there'd be no movie. This is a change of pace for Bob Mitchum. We normally associate him with tough crime dramas. But his hard-as-nails disposition and rugged physicality and vitality actually translate well to comedies. The best example of this is Holiday Affair (1949). Anyway, wouldn't you know it, Doc reluctantly falls for that posh and giddy dame, never mind that he's got this (deserved) rep as the town Lothario, never mind that he calls Corby an ""empty-headed idiot"" to her face. She later retorts, ""I'll get even with you, you pig doctor."" (Note that the Doc's clientele tends to pay him with pigs and eggs and such.) Still, he keeps her secret, even when she starts mailing envelopes of money to everyone - and that, by the by, is when the fit truly hits the shan.

Ain't too long before word gets out about the town's sudden windfall, and, lo, take a gander at them swarms of greedy bodies making a beeline for Progress (nestled in the northern part of Arkansas, just off Highway 33, if you're lookin' to join in).

Jean Simmons is her usual self, demure and classy and beautiful. I fancy the naivet&eacute; she exhibits in her role. I find it endearing, even if it aggravates the hunky sawbones. She and Mitchum are great together, great at their characters getting on each other's nerves. They're not the problem with this movie, nor is it the supporting cast that provides the interesting local color. Thing is, they're forced to work with a weak script, and a weak script reduces the movie into a genial but slight slice-of-life comedy, a pleasant picture that's cool to pass the time with, but something that'll linger in your system about as long as a fleeting thought. Still, I enjoyed the offbeat flavor of Progress' population of rustics. I had fun with the silly romantic complications that crop up. I appreciate the little comic touches, like avid fisherman Doc Sellers' ongoing feud with his nemesis, Old Hercules, that elusive trout, and, also, his emergency push button by the door that blares like it was heralding the Second Coming. It's an emergency push button that the oil heiress, in her obliviousness, leans on several times, never mind that her needs weren't quite of the death's door variety. It's worth it just to see Mitchum race the obstacle course from the fishing creek to his office, and then the look on his face when he finds he'd ran like bejesus for nothing.

By the way, note that the item is a Region 2 DVD so you'd best have an all-region DVD player. You've been warned.",1473120000,,5302,4.694623655913978
8467287,4,B005DOSCNA,"SHE COULDN'T SAY NO is a fascinating entry in the canon of Robert Mitchum films; it is comedy set in a small Arkansas town in which he plays a doctor with a passion for fishing.  Life proceeds in a calm unhurried manner until spoiled rich girl Korby Lane (Jean Simmons) pays an extended visit.  With more money than sense, she makes every effort to make the citizens' life better by giving them presents and/or gifts of cash, as she believes she has a debt to reply to the town, for having saved her life when she was a little girl.  Unfortunately she only succeeds in creating chaos.  Lloyd Bacon's film (his final work in a long career) has a strong moral tone to it, suggesting quite overtly that money is the root of all evil.  D. D. Beauchamp's and William Powers' screenplay has some sharp one-liners in it, allowing Mitchum to display his talent for throwaway observations (something equally evident in the interviews he gave over the years on television).  The film also has some strong character-performances by Arthur Hunnicutt (as Odie, a recovering alcoholic with a penchant for non sequiturs such as ""It's very Monday today, isn't it""); Wallace Ford (as a splenetic vet); and Hope Landin (as a maternal boarding-house keeper).  Simmons' costumes are a continual source of attention, especially when compared with the rather dowdy attire of the citizens; it's clear she is trying her best to draw people's gazes towards her.  In terms of ideology. SHE COULDN'T SAY NO is redolent of mid-Fifties attitudes towards women, suggesting that they are not ""fulfilled"" unless they get married and have children.  Hence the ending is rather wearily predictable.  But nonetheless there are some incidental pleasures along the way, not least the sequence where Mitchum brings boxes of diapers to one of his patients' houses, only to find that Korby has (anonymously) sent a huge pile already.  The sight of Mitchum's face, a mixture of anger and sheer bewilderment, is a sight to behold, reminding us 0 if we didn't already know - of his versatility as a film actor, despite his public protestations to the contrary.",1401840000,3,2117,4.885474860335195
