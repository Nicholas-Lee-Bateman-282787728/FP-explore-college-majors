8055306,1,B00081OW64,"Picked this up because I remembered it from my youth, but was very disappointed in the quality of both the video and the audio, it was barely watchable.",1136246400,4,152,4.464285714285714
8055307,3,B00081OW64,"This is actually a very nicely done little sci-fi pic.  The special effects were great for the time with above average production qualities.  While it could have used a bit more of the monster, the story still keeps one's attention.  The able cast includes Moe from The Three Stooges playing a small but involved part as a cab driver.

This is one of the only 50's sci-fi that I've come across, other than Kronos, that was filmed in 2:35 widescreen.  There are a couple of collectors prints in circulation - one is a pretty decent full frame/pan and scan and the other is the nice widescreen transfer, though the picture here is a bit darker.  Don't miss it!!",1134432000,7,659,4.5423728813559325
