4462211,5,B004SB72HQ,The only way you could play a UK DVD is have a region-free DVD player or play it on your PC.  The standard DVD players in the US are not compatiable with PAL or Region 2 discs.  They work fine on my computer.,1369353600,10,208,3.813953488372093

4462213,1,B004SB72HQ,"I was excited to order this product because it was the same cartoon type back when I was in grade school. I was ready to go down memory land. Upon product receipt, I immediately tried to watch it ONLY to find out that it only plays in European format(forgot technical name).

4462215,1,B004SB72HQ,"total rip off and not worth the money at all...

first of all it's a really old series that should be going for less then $10...the freaking dvd is region whatever so you can't even play it here in America unless you waste more money and more time going out to buy a special expensive dvd player that can actually play the freaking disk!!
....
out of all the marvel cartoon's it is obvious that Thor was the worst of all and the least exciting...iron man, spiderman, captain America, fantastic four, x-men ect.. all way better then this garbage thor cartoon...overpriced and you cant even buy it from amazonprime meaning you might not even end up getting it, or get it 1week-2months later which is stupid!!!

don't get this rip off please!!!!!",1406505600,,743,4.621212121212121

4462217,3,B004SB72HQ,"A clear transfer, but missing the recaps.  Three part episodes edited together into one and in some cases titles moved around because the title card for part two or part three is more apt title for edited story.  Remember all UK PAL playback is 25 frames per second.  Original cartoons recorded at 24 frames per second, so playback sound has 4% chipmunk speed up effect.  You'll probably notice that.  At some point, the original Marvel Super Heroes TV show needs to be released properly.  Now that Sub-Mariner rights are cleared up, all five characters are again available to Disney, so it's possible.  It would be nice to see the opening theme sequence, ""The Marvel Super Heroes have arrived"" and the full end title song ""Merry Marvel Marching Society.""  I seriously doubt original elements are still available for the missing opening and end titles or they would have surfaced already.  No one seems interested in presenting this material properly as a collectors item.  Everyone who releases these cartoons seems determined to treat it as kiddie tv.",1404000000,8,1053,4.965714285714285

This item was purchased on the American website version of amazon.
This digital video disc should have been released for region 1. USA, AND CANADA

I think the x box one system will be region free.",1380672000,,328,4.306451612903226

4462224,5,B004SB72HQ,"The item description clearly states this is region 2 PAL DVD set. Buy a multi-region player on Amazon for amazingly cheap and watch lots of great stuff not released in the USA. How much easier can it be? Jeeze!

In any case... Spoilers may follow.

I've watched a bunch of the 1966 Marvel hero series, and they're all highly entertaining. This one is no exception. I'm not a big fan of Thor. I think he's silly. Silly looking and silly concept. So, part of my entertainment factor watching this series is for unintentional comedy. And it delivers. With Loki saying lines like, ""I must get the golden bees across the rainbow bridge!"" How can you not laugh? You go girlfriend!

There's the whole soap opera aspect as well. Thor's dad is a big old jerk to poor Thor. Then there's the love he can't express or his identity will be blown.

Of course there's the oddly wonderful static animation which really is the main attraction. There is very little movement. Which I think is extremely cool.",1376352000,,990,4.607954545454546

8439593,5,B004SB72HQ,"Bought a multi region DVD player exclusively to buy and watch these cartoons that are currently unavailable in the US. First bought a Thor VHS back in the 90's with a few episodes including ""Enter Hercules"". Found an older 80's Marvel compilation VHS that had another episode ""Tomorrow Man"". Transferred these to DVD-R.  I was very pleased to get this complete set of 60's Thor. This cartoon is HILARIOUS and the ""Deus ex Machina"" in the storylines are a large part of that. Also the old school language plays its part (""Get Thee Hence"" or ""I plight my troth"" are good examples). Loki also cracks me up. ""Enter Hercules"" remains one of my favorite episodes. Also the one with the Enchantress is enticing! This far exceeds the 60's Spiderman cartoon in my opinion.",1462233600,3,763,4.7368421052631575
