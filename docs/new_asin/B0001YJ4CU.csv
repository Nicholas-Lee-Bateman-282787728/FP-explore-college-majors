She says to measure from top to bottom  to get length of fabric you want to cut.  I don't think she took into account that you need to make a pocket and fold the fabric over for the pocket sleeve and the top ruffle thus adding at least 6-8 inches more to your length.",1329264000,,402,4.037974683544304
