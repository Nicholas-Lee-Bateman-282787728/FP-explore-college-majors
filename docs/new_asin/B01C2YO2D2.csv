With all the discussion about illegal immigrants and problems along the Mexican border you would think more movies would be made about the topic. The only problem is if that happened then sides would be taken, arguments would follow and according to the press mass hysteria would occur. So when this movie arrived I wasn't sure what to make of it but Im glad I got to see it. Rather than take sides on the issues it tells a story instead and thats a good sign of a well-made movie.

Claudia (Veronica Sixtos) is an illegal immigrant living in living in the US with her mother and making a living via credit card fraud and identity theft. Living beyond her means in what seems to be a soulless stupor she is caught by the FBI and deported across the border to live with her father, Andres (Julio Cedillo). Andres has not been a big part of Claudias life in the past and he has little sympathy for her nor intentions of taking it easy on her. His ranch is a hard lifestyle to change too and the work isn't easy but he expects her to carry her own load.

All the while Claudia thinks of nothing but returning across the border illegally and back to the US. Andres has his ranch hand Arturo take Claudia with him to work on the fences. While out at a far end of the ranch Arturo sees a car headed for them and runs for a nearby hill. In the car is Ricky (Roberto Urbina), a smuggler that Arturo works for on the side. Having stolen from him Ricky and his men have every intention of killing Arturo and Claudia leaving no witnesses behind. When Claudia offers her services to Ricky to help him do the job assigned to Arturo he agrees and leaves with Arturo tied to the back of his car.

As the movie progresses Claudia continues to seem to have no life inside of her. While her father constantly argues with her Claudias grandmother tells him he needs patience and to guide her. Claudia goes from helping Ricky to sharing his bed, all with the hopes of making enough money and a connection with him that hell smuggle her back across the border. Its a deadly game and one she might not survive, especially when the military shows to put an end to the border smuggling operation. Just who will survive and the question of Claudia finding her soul make for an interesting film.

As I said from the start what really made this film interesting was the fact that it took the issues of border security and illegal immigrants and turned it on its head, not taking one side or the other and discussing both the lure of coming to America (taking a part of the vast wealth possible there) and the story of a young woman who is so caught up in her desire to live the high life that she never thinks further than her own needs and how she matures before the film ends. By taking on these issues rather than those most would expect we have a fleshed out story rather than rhetoric from one side or the other on the political aspects of the concept. In the end while each of those issues posed are discussed the film provokes one to consider those political ideas at the same time in a back door sort of way.

The film is well made and looks great. The performances from actors I for one am unfamiliar with were so well done that you never thought you were watching anyone act, they seemed to be the roles they were playing. There are some scenes of sexuality that some might be bothered by but the majority of people will simply gloss over; that being said it is definitely not a movie for children. But for those willing to watch this film you will find yourself engrossed in the story of Claudia and her family and think more when it comes to the issues of the border.",1462752000,3,3708,4.320402298850575

7671671,5,B01C2YO2D2,I'm a big fan of this film. The beautiful cinematography and moody score enhance a great story and amazing performances. I saw this at the Los Angeles film festival last year and have seen it several times since then; each time I get something new out of it. It's very suspenseful and is still exciting even on re-watching. So great to see a strong female lead carry an action film. I would also recommend this to my friends who only watch movies with explosions and gun fights.,1460764800,2,478,4.505747126436781

One of those movie that when your  finished watching  it makes you  think and say even if something is tough it may still be managed.

8752069,2,B01C2YO2D2,"The movie had a lot of unreal and negative messages in it.  The protagonist was a criminal to begin with.  A white collar criminal is still a criminal nonetheless.  She gets deported across the border where very conveniently her estranged dad lives next to the border.  She rides a horse like a pro, even though she probably never seen a horse in most of her life.  She starts doing manual labor as if she had done that all of her life (the manual labor she was doing would be hard to do even for a man).  She gets involved with the head of a criminal organization, hits him in the face and doesn't get shot or hit back for it, even thought this guy had killed other people before.  She actually crosses the border by truck to San Ysidro without getting checked out by the border patrol.  The end was very weak and a copy of  ""No country for old men"".  She gives a suitcase full of money to her dad to give to her mom (who was very irresponsible and an accomplice in the criminal upbringing of her daughter) in the U.S. and she stays behind in Mexico without any money.  The movie had good cinematography, but the plot or story was very amateurish, probably was even taken straight out of a college or University screenplay assignment, and overall this is probably why the movie ended up in Amazon Prime.",1513296000,,1304,4.369294605809128
