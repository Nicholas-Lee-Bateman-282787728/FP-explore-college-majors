In the course of making that documentary the filmmakers Adele Schmidt and Jose Zegarra Holder collected more concert footage and interviews than they could use.  Their solution, and it's a good one, was to release this 'companion DVD' as an adjunct.

The concert footage here, taken from several different venues over the past few years, is really excellent quality -- although at only one song per band I would have gladly sat through more.  The interviews are not lengthy either, and mostly self-explanatory as to why they were left on the cutting room floor.  The DVD is in a cardboard sleeve with minimal packaging, no pictures and very little data.  It was a good idea to give us ""more music and more interviews"" but I could wish for the whole concerts these songs came from!",1400371200,,1019,5.627450980392157
