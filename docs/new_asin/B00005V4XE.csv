1671161,5,B00005V4XE,"DVD of ""Homicidal"" by William Castle
...
... It's especially terrific to see William Castle's
""Homicidal"" on DVD, looking and sounding
crisp and new. It's an eerie, sometimes almost
unbearably creepy film that proves like his other
horror films, he was more than showman, he was
a fine filmmaker as well. Because his films were
basically aimed at the kid audience, it's especial
fun that this one concerns, in addition to
homicide (which was considered safe viewing for
us, somehow), homosexuality, transsexualism
and transvestitism. Coming not that long after
the Christine Jorgensen sex change landmark,
could Castle have had this in mind? Perhaps. I
can see him smiling round that huge cigar,
knowing he pulled another fast one, and was
subtly subverting legions of children whose
parents thought they were only seeing another
spook film.
With fine performances by Jean Arliss (at last we
know a bit about her, thanks to the fun, nostalgic
featurette ""Psychette"" on the DVD, that has also
vintage clips of Castle, the joyous hucksterism,
the glee at all the money to be made--priceless),
always heroic Glenn Corbett, and especially the
lovely, talented Patricia Breslin, a script by Robb
White that jaggedly gets in the nerves and twists
and turns most excruciatingly, and excellent
black and white photography that excels
especially in this transfer, we enter Castle
country that is bleak and grim and daring. When
the justice of the peace (the great James
Westerfield) gets it in the stomach, it still is gory
enough, still shocking, even when you already
have seen the film several times before. It's all a
haunted house distorting mirror show. Where
horrible revenge is exacted because of cruelty
experienced in childhood. Where there is an
unrelenting justice that comes from the core of
the character, that old desire to right wrongs that
can safely be righted in films. And of course
when Helga gets decapitated--how can a person
be faulted for cheering?
One of the neatest lines ever in film is spoken in
a manic whispery trill by Arliss, as she tells
creepy old wheelchair bound mute helpless
Helga that the justice of the peace
""died--screammmming."" Just remembering that
chills me. The delicious claustrophobia, the
woman who seems like not exactly a woman,
with the impressive knife, in the shadow house,
making one afraid of her, hypnotized by her, and
very very frightened. It seems the movie takes
place on the weekend. Probably because that
was when it played. It makes the murders, and
that babbling well meaning doctor who bumbles
to a rescue at the end, Corbett's  kind, stalwart
druggist character, Breslin's character's
compassion and decency, Emily's touching so
sadly, so gently, the top of the head of a little
boy at the malt counter, a fascinating little
puzzle, needing to be seen more than once, and
always nettled by Emily, who almost begs us to
look behind the mask, and by Warren whose
own mask belies his masculinity. Something is
wonderfully frightfully wrong with these two
persons.
It must be a terrible thing, the charade Emily and
Warren were forced to play all their lives. I can't
think of much worse, than the robbing of
identity, getting everything mixed up, not having
a place in one's self that is one's own. Castle's
film asks some serious questions. It's his most
carefully conceived thoughtful film.
Seeing Castle's films on DVD makes one feel at
home again. When you could look at a movie
screen and know you had a friend orchestrating
the proceedings. Castle always gave us our
money's worth and more. With the gimmicks,
the fright break, the cardboard skeleton
careening over audiences, the electric buzzers in
the seats, the coward's corner, the tingler loose
in the audience, all the elements to all his various
movies said this--it's fun to be scared, to be put
off guard, to be thrilled, and then feel a little
loopy after the shock wears off. ""Homicidal""
especially haunts. Arliss--we know a bit more
about her from the ""Psychette""--cold,
implacable, is impossible to forget. Always
baffling before the secret is revealed in the
featurette, or is it?, was the question of who
played Emily and who played Warren, reality
thus skewered, which was good enough for
children because when you're a kid, little does
seem real, and as an adult, even less. The scene,
before the curtain call, of the fallen doll and the
whip (yes, the whip) on it strikes the right chord
of chortle, sadness, scares and the terrible
business of revisiting the past when the past is a
nightmare.
The movie is beautifully atmospheric, from that
seedy motel to that dark creep fest of the twisted
souls in that house, and that long long descent of
the staircase elevator chair coming down and
down with Helga's head perched precariously on
her shoulders and then falling, in shadow,
off--well, sleep came with difficulty that summer
night when I first saw the movie on TV. And
that was just fine. Castle always took us
seriously. He did not condescend to us. He
wanted to show us a good time. These DVDs he
would have absolutely been overjoyed with.  It's
a movie to luxuriate in. To dwell in. It means
something. Castle told us childhood is a sucker's
game too-- right under the noses of Those Who
Said Just the Opposite. The movie's about more
than murders of the body.  Telling us then and
perhaps now, it's a ...scary world, childhood
included, don't trust anybody. They ARE after
you. For no one is as they appear.
Like all real classics, you see them years later,
there are levels there you didn't notice
before. See his movies on these brilliantly made
DVDs, with extras, including those
magnificent Castle previews, and enjoy returning
to childhood terror courtesy of one
William Castle--legend.",1020297600,13,5731,4.930641821946169
1671162,5,B00005V4XE,"There are a lot of things going for this film. Anyone who knows the films of William Castle knows that they are schlocky, gimmicky & always entertaining. I saw this as a child and was frightened repeatedly; it never came out on video so I taped it off AMC or TMC. Imagine my surprise on DVD, a perfectly crisp & clear transfer with great sound...and Von Dexter has composed the scores for Castle's best films, and he does not disappoint. The DVD is great because it has extras...spoilers, for those who haven't seen this...one previous reviewer... gave away the suprise ending. Never mind. Even knowing this film well encourages repeated viewings. Jean Arless, of course, is the centerpiece here, and it's a good thing she didn't use her real name (the actress, Jean Marshall, didn't want to be ""type-cast""...). It's really an exercise in over-acting and she did not hold back! I don't know how Castle convinced the great acting coach, Eugenie Leontovich, to perform in his film, but it's a treasure. She doesn't actually have a lot to do except glower & look scared, but it's a confident display of a true master. Glenn Corbett and Patricia Breslin (a popular TV actress of the period, The Jackie Cooper Show) were very good-looking and played the ingenue sweethearts that you genuinely liked. I would like to know what happened to Richard Rust (the handsome Jim Nesbitt character). He died young, but his career should've been grander. OK...so, notice this: When the detective visits Breslin at her flower shop, has Nesbitt identify her, and they leave...why does he put on the police car siren as they drive away? What doctor prescribed the prescription that Emily went to fill? When Corbett's character suggests to Warren that it was ""a similar pattern as the Adrins murder""...to what was he referring? There are so many inconsistancies, most of which come to mind after the resolution of the plot, and, sure, Castle said it was an homage to ""Psycho"" (checking into a hotel, etc.) and some of the well-directed camerawork showed the Hitchcockian shots that reminded the audience that they should keep alert (the knife in the magazine, etc.). Remember when doctors made house calls...? He happened to be in the neighborhood? William Castle is not one of our greatest directors of all time. But, to be sure, he probably took more pride in his work than most. He also worked exclusively with original screenplays. They may be criticized for being derivitive, but he certainly made every film his own, and carried it one step further. I like this film, on many levels...but I happen to be an afficiado of bad acting and unbelievable plots. 13 GHOSTS had humor; THE TINGLER was certainly far-fetched (but kept everyone wondering) and HOMICIDAL was probably his most well-plotted, just enough to make it ""special"" from PSYCHO. If you've read this far, you're probably a fan of the film. And, so am I. CASTLE RULES! When will ""Macabre"" be available?Only drawback is that it's not in Widescreen. Otherwise, print is crisp & clear.",1018915200,3,3026,4.889105058365759
1671163,4,B00005V4XE,"WORD OF WARNING. The DVD has a small but enjoyable package of extras including a making-of-documentary called ""Psychette."" If you have never seen HOMICIDAL, do NOT watch the documentary until you've seen the film: in true spoiler fashion, it reveals the film's famous surprise ending. That said--
William Castle ""borrowed"" rather liberally from Hitchcock's slightly earlier PSYCHO for this tale of a knife-wielding blonde beauty--but as usual, he gave it his showman's spin. In theatrical release, the film featured a ""fright break."" As the action approaches a climax, a clockface appears on the screen and Castle himself urges those too terrified to return to the lobby for a full refund. But there was, of course, a catch: you had to walk (usually in yellow footsteps applied to the carpet) past the jeering audience and agree to sit in ""The Coward's Corner"" until the movie was over and every one had filed out past you! Needless to say, few (if any) movie-goers ever took him up on it.
But the famous ""Fright Break"" isn't the only thing HOMICIDAL has going for it. The story itself is more sophistocated than that of most William Castle films, and the female leads are quite effective. Jean Arless, a surprising beauty, is quite startling as ""The Homicidal Girl""--a blonde bombshell who has a way with a knife--while both Patricia Breslin and Eugenie Leontovich are quite convincing as two of those on her list of intended victims. And lastly, the film offers a surprise conclusion that can still blindside some less suspecting viewers even today. That aside, HOMICIDAL has plenty of camp appeal, all of it resting on Jean Arless' WAY over the top performance as she entices, ices, and slices her way from one victim to the next--and as one reviewer has already remarked, you'll feel pretty sure that Annie Lennox borrowed Arless' look (and in some pretty unexpected ways, too) for several of her videos.
I must admit that I don't consider HOMICIDAL in the same league with other William Castle schlock-favorites such as 13 GHOSTS, HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL, or STRAIT-JACKET--largely, I think, because it seems Castle really is making a bid for cinematic respectability here and that sorta detracts from the fun. But all the same, most fans of Castle's silly horror flicks should get a stab--I mean, a KICK--out of it!",1017792000,3,2319,4.948717948717949
1671164,5,B00005V4XE,"Many viewers have stumbled into this kinky jigsaw puzzle of a thriller thinking they have a handle on it only to pleasantly shocked and surprised. Jean Arless (aka Joan Marshall) contributes a marvelous performance as ""Emily."" As a director, William Castle doesn't come a country mile within Hitchocok, but there are plenty of nice touches. Check out the subliminal close up shot of Emily's eyebrows on the staircase scene -- is something amiss here? Also the snapshot of Emily in Denmark proffered by Warren ... curious, very curious. I used the pause button on my DVD player a lot here. There's something about ""Emily"" that's not right. I also enjoyed the scene involving an ominous black briefcase containing a slip of paper with a prescription on it. The briefcase opens, we cut away and we don't see what's inside. And why does Emily need a heavy black briefcase to carry a slip of paper? The scene in the floral shop is a classic. All in all, there's no reason not to take this ""Fright Break.""",1017619200,3,999,4.714285714285714

1671167,5,B00005V4XE,"Alfred Hitchcock may very well have borrowed a page from gimmick king William Castle's book when he devised the advertising campaign for his legendary shocker, ""Psycho"". The advertisements for ""Psycho"" strongly stated that one one would be allowed into the theater once the picture had started, and this was strictly enforced.  Some theaters even provided chairs for patrons to sit in while waiting on line for the next showing!  A great publicity move for a great movie. Which now brings us back to Mr. Castle. The gimmick for ""Homicidal"" was a ""Fright Break"", which came just before the climax of the film. A clock appeared on the screen, allowing 45 seconds for viewers who were ""too frightened"" to stay for the end of the picture to leave, but they would have to stand in ""Coward's Corner"", a yellow-painted booth in the lobby. These chickenhearts would also have to sign a certificate which stated, ""I am a bona fide coward"". Oh, that Bill Castle! ""Homicidal"" is the story of a tall, willowy blonde named Emily who happens to be a psychotic, knife-wielding killer. Emily pays a hunky bellhop $2,000 to marry her in a midnight ceremony, and then stabs the justice of the peace to death! Since Emily is far too young to blame her sudden nasty behavior on hormones, it's obvious that she has a couple of screws loose. Taking it on the lam following the rather unorthodox ceremony, leaving the groom at the altar (now that's a switch!), Emily dashes to her car and drives off to the gloomy old house where she lives with her husband Warren, a rather epicene-looking young man.  They have recently returned from Denmark with Helga, Warren's former nursemaid, who is now wheelchair-bound, mute and paralyzed due to a stroke. Helga distrusts and fears Emily (wouldn't you be a little nervous around this loony Barbie doll?), and knows too much for her own good.  Warren's half-sister Miriam doesn't care too much for Emily either, and is rather disturbed by her strange and unpleasant behavior. The fact that Emily went into Miriam's flower shop and destroyed several figurines and a wedding wreath doesn't exactly endear her to Miriam. I won't divulge any more of the plot (I've probably told too much already), but the film has a reasonable amount of suspense, builds very nicely to its climax, and may genuinely surprise some with its ""twist"". The film is more of a homage than a rip-off of ""Psycho"", and is at least more interesting and entertaining than Brian DePalma's shrill ""homages"", the tiresome sequels, and the awful Gus Van Sant remake.  The late Joan Marshall, acting under the pseudonym ""Jean Arless"", is very good as the lovely, twisted Emily, and renowned stage actress Eugenie Leontovich is quite good as the noisy Helga (she can't speak, but she makes a hell of a ruckus anyway!) Patricia Breslin and Glenn Corbett lend good support as Miriam and the befuddled bellhop. The great Hugo Friedhofer composed the music score. Having composed for such ""respectable"" films as ""The Best Years of Our Lives"", ""The Lodger"", and ""The Rains of Ranchipur"", one can only assume that he was paid well for this ""B"". To give William Castle his due, the film is directed with visual flair and style, and I would safely guess that he must have sat through ""Psycho"" at least 20 times!
The picture and sound quality on the DVD are excellent, the picture quality unbelievably sharp and rich. The ""making of"" featurette, ""Psychette"", is fun, including footage of Mr. Castle asking theater patrons how they liked the picture, ""I liked it much better than 'Psycho'!"" (gulp!), but it is all-too-brief. ""Homicidal"" is not the disturbing, stay-with-you cinematic masterpiece that ""Psycho"" is, but it is a lot of fun. It has that wonderful thread (hell, rope!) of ludicrousness that runs through it, the unmistakable hallmark of a William Castle film.  One final observation: earlier in this review, I stated that William Castle must have seen ""Psycho"" at least 20 times. I have a strong belief that Eurythmics' Annie Lennox must have seen ""Homicidal"" just as many!",1016755200,3,4054,4.893740902474527
1671168,4,B00005V4XE,"This has been a LONG time coming officially to home video, never even released on VHS.  Castle fans are still awaiting official releases of (among others) his classics MACABRE, and his remake of James Whale's OLD DARK HOUSE (HINT!).  Anyway, HOMICIDAL is a great deal of fun, and ""Jean Arless"" gives a terrific performance as...well, you'll have to see.  These days you'd have to be blind not to anticipate the classic twist ending, revealing that...well, you'll have to see. I will say there are a few great shocks, and delicious dialogue from Castle's best writing collaborator, Robb White.
As for the DVD - the ""Psychette"" (as in 'a less-grand version of PSYCHO') is OK but too darn short (under 7 minutes), like Columbia's other recent Castle releases (13 GHOSTS, MR. SARDONICUS). It would also be nice if they could track down some original cast or crew rather than interviewing contemporary film critics and horror buffs.  They seem not to have good source materials as the DVD is full-frame, and there is no trailer for Homicidal on the disk.  The clips from the original trailer used in the featurette seem to come from a shaky VHS. Similarly the ""trailer"" for STRAIT-JACKET is only a 30 second TV spot.  The movie's image quality is very decent but nothing special.

PSYCHO made a heap obf money and so, Castle hired Robert Bloch, the original author of PSYCHO to write something similar for Castle to direct. The result was HOMICIDAL. I's as if you had taken all the pages from Psycho, cut them into ribbons and pasted them together haphazardly to make something new. All the elements are here: A runaway blond, a brutal stabbing, a Ford Sedan, a big house in the sticks, a pile of money, a handsome leading man, an old lady, insanity, transvestitism and a big sharp knife.

""William Castle... came up with 'Coward's Corner,' a yellow cardboard booth, manned by a bewildered theater employee in the lobby. When the Fright Break was announced, and you found that you couldn't take it any more, you had to leave your seat and, in front of the entire audience, follow yellow footsteps up the aisle, bathed in a yellow light. Before you reached Coward's Corner, you crossed yellow lines with the stencilled message: 'Cowards Keep Walking.' You passed a nurse (in a yellow uniform?...I wonder), who would offer a blood-pressure test. All the while a recording was blaring, ""'Watch the chicken! Watch him shiver in Coward's Corner'!"" As the audience howled, you had to go through one final indignity -- at Coward's Corner you were forced to sign a yellow card stating, 'I am a bona fide coward.' Very, very few were masochistic enough to endure this.... I'm sure that in many cities a plant had to be paid to go through this torture.

1671219,2,B00005V4XE,"It takes a certain amount of cojones to not only rip off Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho,"" but think you can one-up one of the greatest twist endings of all time.

And for that reason alone, you have to kind of admire William Castle for ""Homicidal,"" which copies a lot of the superficial aspects of ""Psycho"" -- an icy blonde, an old lady confined to a house, a small California town, a brunette in peril -- but also tries to outtwist the twist. It's pure, unadulterated cheese with Castle's trademark gimmicks (in this case, a ""fright break,"" during which you could could cravenly flee the theatre for a full refund), and just as silly as that would suggest.

A mysterious blonde woman (Jean Arless) -- whose name is Emily, though she doesn't give it right away -- checks into a hotel, and pays an attractive bellboy to enter an immediately-annullable marriage with her that evening. They head to the local justice of the peace.... and Emily immediately stabs the guy to death and makes her escape. After returning to a luxurious mansion, Emily gloats to the elderly, mute Helga (Eugenie Leontovich), whom she seems to be the nurse/keeper for.

When she was younger, Helga was the nurse for the Webster half-siblings, Miriam and Warren, whose father was a violent misogynist who divorced Miriam's mother for not instantly producing a son, and abused Warren to make him ""manly."" Helga whisked Warren off to Denmark for many years, and has recently returned with Emily in tow.

And though anyone with eyeballs can immediately tell what the relationship between Warren and Emily is, Miriam is completely clueless -- she thinks that Warren has married Emily. But even Miriam can tell that something is terribly wrong, since Helga keeps trying to tell her something, and Emily breaks into Miriam's flower shop to trash the place. As the police snoop around for the murderer, Miriam begins to figure out that Emily is the killer -- and she may be the next victim.

One of the main reasons that ""Homicidal"" doesn't really work as a ""shocking twist"" story is... well, it's abundantly clear what the twist is, if you have the slightest ability to recognize faces. One of the important aspects of the ""Psycho"" story is that Mother's face is never shown, so nobody can tell until the very end what is going on... but in this movie, every face is shown in full light. So I spent most of the movie patiently waiting for everyone to figure out what I already knew, and wondering why Miriam has looked both Emily and Warren in the face... and NEVER NOTICED.

As a result, ""Homicidal"" is just not very effective as a thriller, especially since a large chunk of the story is just made up of Emily voicing threats and telling lies. But without revealing too much, ""Homicidal"" does have a convoluted double twist of soap-opera proportions, which only makes sense with a final explanation. It also turns out to be much less transphobic than I initially feared, but it does come across as rather silly and overly-elaborate.

Up until then, it's grade-A, B-movie cheez of the type that Castle specialized in. The opening scenes have a measure of genuine tension, which erupts into glorious hamminess when Emily starts stabbing the justice with the expression of a woman with stomach cramps, even as his wife screams like the ""Home Alone"" kid.

From there on out, Jean Arless (aka Joan Marshall) acts with teeth bared and eyes staring and crazy. Admittedly, Arless does do a good job differentiating her double role, playing them with different body language and expressions. But when playing Emily, she sometimes veers around like a car driven by someone on acid (""You would dry up and DIE!""), chewing the scenery like a shapely blonde paper-shredder.

And a lot of Castle's direction veers along with her -- while Emily's mind games are vaguely menacing, a lot of her actions are not very scary (such as trashing the apartment and sabotaging Miriam's engagement), and she doesn't seem to be doing much to thwart the police investigation. Most of the story seems to be filler between the shocking beginning and the not-very-shocking end.

""Homicidal"" is mostly enjoyable as a gloriously goofy B-movie -- it doesn't even come close to the greats of the genre, but the ham and cheese is fun to watch. Ironically entertaining, though not much of a thriller.",1424131200,,4327,4.827260458839406
1671220,5,B00005V4XE,"I saw this movie in 1962 at our local neighborhood theater (The Lincoln, in Detroit).

The rest of the film you are left on the edge of your seat waiting for Ms. Murderess to flip out again.  She certainly gives some good indications that she will.  But, there is a method, not to mention a reason, for her lack of madness.  Also, there is a strange looking young man that leaves you wondering.

They mention that the young man, when he was a child, was taken to Scandanavia and what happened there no one knows.  Draw your own conclusions.  At times, this film equals Psycho in tension.

William Castle had to be the inspiration for PSYCHO. Alfred Hitchcock's expensive color mystery VERTIGO had lost money, even with lovely Kim Novak and Legend Jimmy Stewart in the leading roles. Hitchcock had noticed that badly directed schlock horror films were making money hand over fist, while he was being ignored. He had to be thinking about Willam Castle. In response, he made PSYCHO, an inexpensive murder movie with the Hitchcock touch. Psycho made a mint at the box office. Castle had to have noticed this, and so he responded with HOMICIDAL.

Take all of the elements of PSYCHO and put them in a blender: The Blonde, The Cheap Hotel, The flight in the Ford Sedan, Changing Cars, The Knife, The Murder, The Handsome Boyfriend, The Sister, The Old Lady, Cross-Dressing, and secrets. There you have it, or do you?

Gordon gave us well,...BIG: AMAZING COLLOSAL MAN, CYCLOPS, GIANT SPIDER INVASION, BEGINNING OF THE END, etc., and again fun.
William Castle is all together a different story. He had the ability to make a low budget go a long way and generate such classics as Vincent Price's HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL and THE TINGLER. Riding the crest of Hitchcock's PSYCHO and Aldrich's WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? Castle placed Joan Crawford into STRAIT JACKET and Barbara Stanwick into THE NIGHT WALKER, both highly suspenseful, credible motion pictures on minimalistic budgets. And unlike Corman and Gordon, Castle's films had a real polish to them, a fine noirish feel with competent acting and production values.
And so, HOMICIDAL, which I belive is Castle's best film by far. I truly liked it better than PSYCO, which outside the shower scene, is nowhere near as interesting and ultimately disturbing as HOMICIDAL. Jean Arliss, simply outstanding! I will not tell any of the plot for fear of being banished to the ""coward's corner"". You just have to see this film for yourself.

1671260,4,B00005V4XE,"Homicidal (William Castle, 1961)

Oh, my god. I cannot believe I didn't see that ending coming. The funny thing is, less than thirty seconds before the Big Reveal, I'd said to myself, ""man, it seems like Castle really ripped off [name of movie that would give away the big surprise]!"" And yet my jaw still hit the floor. Because of this, I'm inclined to rate Homicidal a lot higher than I would have, William Castle joints are, by and large, basement-budget potboilers short on talent and long on cheap thrills, but even a cheap thrill really works once in a while, and man, did it ever here.

Homicidal opens with a bang--we meet a blonde bombshell named Emily (TV stalwart Joan Marshall in one of her few big-screen appearances) who checks into a hotel, specifies a handsome bellhop, and then propositions him--two thousand dollars if he'll marry her on September 6th. He accepts, and the two of them head out to see Alfred S. Adrims, Justice of the Peace (The Absent-Minded Professor's James Westerfield), late at night. He agrees to do the ceremony despite the late hour, but it ends with quite a surprise--Emily repeatedly stabs him, then runs off, leaving her new husband and a screaming widow in the lurch. She repairs to the family homestead to lay low until the investigation blows over, but while there, she finds herself attracted to Karl (Midway's Glenn Corbett), not only the local druggist, but also the steady boyfriend of Emily's half-sister Miriam (I Saw What You Did's Patricia Breslin). But that's not all there is to this story, not at all...

I realized what I'd been missing when trolling IMDB for information on the actors: the screenplay was written by the brilliant Robb White, equally adept as a screenwriter (he also partnered with Castle on the latter's other best flick, Thirteen Ghosts) and a novelist (Up Periscope, Deathwatch). Put White behind a typewriter and magic flowed. Add a darned fine bit of acting from Marshall and some good performances by the rest of the cast, and a few of Castle's cheap thrills, and somehow it all works. One of Castle's best, if not at the top of the heap. *** ",1243814400,,2126,4.753387533875339
1671261,3,B00005V4XE,"A few of William Castle's dvd movies are becoming harder to buy these days for some reason; they seem to be going out of circulation. Maybe the powers that be will be releasing a fun boxed set one of these days.

For those who have not yet seen ""Homicidal"", it is definitely worthwhile if you enjoy those ""so bad they're good"" horror films of the 50's and 60's... particularly if you like anything that's over the top. Well, over the top and collapsed in a heap on the other side.
Much of the film does not makes sense, and much of it is laughable (which is the true joy of it).

So, that's my advice to newbies.

And now for those who are already acquainted with ""Homicidal"", and Emily, Warren, Miriam, and the 'Fright Break':

(Spoilers ahead.)

I enjoy William Castle's treats. Sure, they're not cinematic horror gems, nor are they the junk of Ed Wood (which I also appreciate). I am not stating anything new when I say that ""Homicidal"" is sort of a blatant ripoff of Hitchcock's ""Psycho"". More about that in a moment.

One of the characters in ""Homicidal"" is named Miriam Webster. Why the screenwriter chose this moniker (since it already belongs to the dictionary) is beyond me. Okay, so it's the Merriam Webster Dictionary. But when you hear the name, it clicks instantly.

For me, William Castle's ""Homicidal"" is a hoot... not as much as his other flicks, but still a hoot.

The first murder is so in-your-face and over the top, I crack up every time I see it. It is so strangely photographed, filled with odd closeups and weird angles. Emily seems to delight in the act. It's a sensational sequence, and made even funnier by the fact that on the close shot of the stabbing, the figures are reversed. In the previous full shot, Emily is standing on the right, and the justice of the peace is on the left. As the stabbing is shown, she is somehow on the left side of the screen, and his torso is on the right. It's things like this that I hate. Whoever shot and edited this scene should be throttled, then tarred and feathered. Then pointed at and laughed at.

And the justice of the peace grasping onto the drapery just smacks of Janet Leigh (Marion Crane) grasping at the shower curtain in ""Psycho"". Honestly, they really had no shame here.
Another blatant borrowing from ""Psycho"" is that Emily's hotel room is laid out very similiarly to Cabin 1 of The Bates Motel.

It's all about as subtle as Mardi Gras, isn't it?

It actually takes quite a while to figure out the relationships of the characters in this film (a sign of poor writing). At first viewing one might wonder who Emily is to Miriam, who Carl is to Miriam, who Warren is to Helga, and so on... It's rather frustrating on first viewing. And it could have so easily and quickly been clarified by the writer.

I think the entire twist is spoiled as soon as Warren makes his first appearance. I don't know how naive movie audiences were in 1961 but I have a feeling that they knew something was up with this strange, petite fellow (whose voice sounded like it wasn't even in the room with the other character he's speaking to; dubbed voices so often sound like they're in a recording booth and not the room of the scene that's being filmed).

The characters of Miriam, Carl, and the detective are all clueless because it never occurs to them that Warren and Emily are never seen together at the same time. It's really very funny.

There's a lot of funny in this film. When Emily takes Helga to the top of the stairs, then says ""Helga! Now!!!"" and puts the skinny knife at Helga's neck (then the screen fades to black). We're supposed to believe that Helga's head gets sliced off easily, as if it were made of Play Doh?

This could have been a decent tale of deceiving the inheritance, but it fails, and ends up being a joke with a flat punchline.
I must admit that Mr. Castle's gimmick here, the Fright Break, is hilarious. I would imagine that nobody in theaters back then would have left during this period.

I only give three stars because ""Homicidal"", to me, lacks as much fun as other Castle concoctions like ""Strait-Jacket"" and ""House on Haunted Hill"".
It's sad, really, because this movie is very much an attempt to trump Hitchock for the success of ""Psycho"", or to cash in on Hitchock's success. Castle could have tried something original. But it's interesting that Hitchcock looked at the horror films of the 1950's that were cheaply made but not scary, and then he made a cheap but extremely scary film of his own.

I do enjoy watching ""Homicidal"", because it's so pathetic and ridiculous. But there's an ugly little aftertaste that lingers when I'm done.
What's most amusing to me personally is that while Warren looks like a girl in drag, Emily looks like a man in drag.",1226275200,2,4750,4.52392065344224

She's been brought to America by her husband, Warren and is taking care of an invalid mute woman at their home.  Warren's half sister is thrown into the mix as well, and pretty soon what we got here is a mystery involving murder, family and inheritance.  William Castle decided to take a break from ghosties and monsters and take a....ahem....stab at Alfred Hitchcock/Robert Bloch kind of material.  I must say he does a very good job, better than you think he would with this kind of material.  Even his little campy introduction and the famous ""fright break"" doesn't hurt any of the mystery or suspense of the film, but simply reminds you you're watching a William Castle film.  It's extremely derivative of ""Psycho"", but nobody seems to complain about this because it's so blatantly obvious that that's what Castle is doing, and he makes no attempts to hide it, but rather winks at the audience about it.  It's not a spoof though, nor is it really campy(only the intro and the ""fright break""), it's actually a good movie.  Some people actually like it more than Psycho(as shown in the featurette).

A couple months ago it played on TCM & I watched it. I'm glad I recorded it since it was presented in the widescreen format {unlike the DVD which is fullscreen and a bit pricy for a fullscreen disc.}
Incidentally, I did buy the fullscreen disc as well after being blown away by Jean Arliss' {Joan Marshall} performance. Made a year after Hitchcock's Psycho,Castle is obviously heavily influenced by it.
I don't want to give anything away but as the Film progresses it's clear that some characters are,shall We say, askew.

William Castle created the actress,Jean Arliss. She had been Acting before Homocidal {and after} as Joan Marshall. She did a lot of late 50's & 60's TV shows. She was the original Lily Munster in the pilot for The Munsters before the produces got Yvonne DeCarlo to join the cast. And...Who can blame them for going with Ms. DeCarlo.....
Marshall's delivery of Her dialogue showed Me She was having a lot of fun  with the role {and being someone else,Arliss...]She delivers 2 exceptional lines of dialogue while speaking to Helga who is mute as well as confined to a wheelchair. {Believe Me....You'll know these 2 lines when You hear them !}
I've watched the Film 11 times since I discovered it and never tire of it. Always the Showman,Castle's ""gimmick"" for this Movie is ""The Fright Break"". Before the final wrap-up, Castle gives the audience a chance to leave if they're to scared to continue.

1671266,5,B00005V4XE,"In 1962, my husband and I, along with many on and off campus college students, went to see the ""much touted,"" Homicidal. Neatly seated in the small theatre, voices were booming until the movie started. Popcorn and cokes were the norm, so we settled down to view the movie we thought would be over rated by the general population of the small town.

Much to our surprise, the black and white thriller lived up to be one of the most horrid things we ever watched. Several minutes into the psycho, popcorn and cokes flew through the air and pelted every head that wasn't under the seat! Screams from men and women echoed as though we were in the Grand Canyon and couldn't get out of the enormous abyss. Taking a few deep breaths to calm our senses, the movie continued while we waited for the next knife to jab into another person's guts. Calm, we were...for awhile.

Refilling the snacks (popcorn and cokes)from the previous episode of the nerve shattering wacko woman's rage, all became quiet. Holy Moley! When the countdown came (it's on the movie) for those to exit the theatre to keep from watching the all time, teeth shattering, hair raising scene...we sat there like dummies. Then Helga, gotta love Helga, scared the beejeebers out of us. Once again, popcorn and cokes soared through the air. One of the ladies in front of us passed out, another one was yelling she was in labor and others scattered out of the movie like mice being chased by a cat.

After the movie, my husband and I had to enter a two story house to get to our apartment. The hall lights would not come on and we ran up the stairs as fast as we could. Needless to say, the movie did a number on our psyche and we talked about this movie for years.

Enter today, as we ordered the movie from Amazon to see if it was what we remembered. YEP. It still made my hair stand on end. If you love psycho movies, much like Alfred Hitchcock's offerings...order this one, but forget the popcorn and cokes...you won't have time to eat them!",1181347200,15,2001,4.459016393442623

The problem is that the DVD release is presented in full screen rather than widescreen and no--that's not the original aspect ratio. The package clearly states that the contents have been ""reformatted to fit 'my' TV."" The Tingler (DVD release: 1999) and Mr. Sardonicus (DVD release: 2002), which are also Columbia releases, are presented correctly in 1.85:1 (although I don't think they're anamorphic).

Mr. Castle, too often categorized as a low budget Hitchcock, was anything but that. He directed many major film stars, was the producer of Rosemary'y Baby, and for over a decade treated filmgoers to a gimmicky bunch of horror films that gave us the creeps but never nightmares.

1671289,4,B00005V4XE,"""Homicidal"" is a very odd horror film from the master of gimmicks, William Castle. Well it's not really that odd, as the plot and structure are inspired and almost stolen from Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"". But it is notably weirder and schlockier, not least of all due to the inclusion of the ""Fright Break""...but more on that later! The film begins by introducing us to a mysterious blonde woman named Emily who gets married to a complete stranger and then stabs the man conducting the wedding ceremony to death, right in the middle of it. Not bad for starters! Emily flees the scene and turns up back at the home she shares with a  mute, wheelchair-bound, elderly woman named Helga. As Emily's behaviour starts to attract suspicion, it's clear that Helga wants to warn people about Emily, but being unable to speak she is unable to make her fears known.

Let me say straight away that the actress playing the character of Emily is terrific. To be honest I don't know how much of the effectiveness is down to her being a bad actress or a good one, but I've seldom seen such an out-there performance by someone playing a psychopath, and the mysteriously named Jean Arless (not really an unknown actress, but actually Joan Marshall under a pseudonym) manages to pull it off with great aplomb. Wavering between seductiveness, brittle anger and sheer hysteria, Emily will keep your attention on the screen every time she appears...when her eyes start widening and she grits her teeth, you really believe this is a character capable of doing anything. The fact that she's dolled up like some crazed Doris Day-style, apple-pie cutie with candyfloss blond curls and big starched skirts only adds to her obvious dementia...no wonder Emily is one of my all-time favourite horror movie psychos!

Sadly when the deranged Emily is off-screen, the film suffers as its several weaker areas become more apparent. Although there's plenty of action, the other characters are mostly dull and insipid, especially the heroine Miriam and her boyfriend, who are far too sensible and predictably nice to be of much interest. Most troubling of all is the character of Miriam's brother Warren, who almost ruins the film with some very odd appearances. The film has a huge shock twist ending, but it's unlikely to surprise anyone, even someone without any prior information about the plot, which is a shame.

But there is still plenty to enjoy. One highlight being Emily's fabulous vandalism of a flower shop. The other being the ""Fright Break""...ah yes. ""Homicidal"" benefits from being one of the few William Castle films with a gimmick that still works when being watched on televison rather than in a theatre. At a certain point in the film, a clock suddenly and unexpectedly appears on the screen and an announcer declares : ""This is the Fright Break...""! Basically, the audience is given the chance to leave if they are too scared to watch what is about to happen...then, when the timer reaches zero, the action re-starts! It looks hilarious and adds a great interactive dimension. You'll have a lot of fun watching this movie.",1149552000,7,3106,4.888045540796964

""13 Ghosts"", ""Straight Jacket"", ""The Tingler"", ""The House on Haunted Hill"", I have been on a Castle kick lately and he just never really disappoints. At least, he hasn't yet. ""Homicidal"" was one I had not seen and so, having been recommended to me due to it's strange Solvang, California (a quaint, Danish tourist trap of a community north of Santa Barbara) setting, I immediately moved it to the top of my queue. It was the typical William castle romp only, instead of the supernatural elements and technical gimmickry one would come to expect from Castle, this one offered more psychological chills with many ideas, and even some shots hilariously and incongruously lifted right from Hitchcock's Psycho, released only 1 year earlier. And this time Castle's gimmick was a twist ending, (DON""T watch the making of documentary on the disc before the film, as I did, as it immediately give away the surprise ending and could ruin the film for the viewer) and a ""Fright Break"" in which, just before the films climax it literally pauses for 45 seconds and a clock appears on the screen allowing audience members that are too frightened by the film time to exit and put themselves on display in the ""Coward's Corner"" of the theater lobby for all the braver patrons to see and scorn as they file out. Is that a genius gimmick or what? For some fun insight into Castle himself, add ""Matinee"" to your queue. This is a 1990s film, clearly based on Castle (played by John Goodman). In the film, we get some fun perspective on what attending Castle films in the theater must have been like. There is even a really fun B&W parody of films from that era within the film ""Matinee"". The film within the film is called ""MANT"" (Man and Ant combined) and I think that about says it all.",1148688000,5,1858,4.633333333333334

The acting is rather forced, but adds to the charm of what makes William Castle's films classics. The violence in the film is rather blunt for it's time (1961), but Castle was always famous for giving us at least two set-pieces in his horror films to keep us going to the end.

If you appreciate classic black and white horror, and want to just chill out with some snacks and be entertained, you will not be disappointed by this film. Trust me, as the ending is worth the price of the film, as being unique for it's time, and a gimmick that made Castle a producer/director that really cared for his craft.",1146700800,3,782,4.423611111111111

I am surprised that the lead actress' career didn't take off in a big way after this film, but Hollywood is fickle.  The plot is more akin to a twisted murder mystery than an out-and-out horror film.

Make sure you have a lot of popcorn and a sense of humor.

The surprise ""twist"" is easy to figure out half way through but you have to wait until the end to discover why Emily is murdering these people.  This is possibly the best of William Castle's movies (although he did produce Rosemary's Baby) and he slowly lets the plot unfurl so you're not quite sure what is going on for the better part of the movie.

Arless looks a bit like Tina Louise, a bit like Amanda Blake, and a bit like Mariette Hartley--but the wrong bits.

As the story opens, a strange woman pays a stranger to marry her and promptly kills the man who performed the ceremony. Back in the sleepy town of Solvang, California, we meet a peculiar young man named Warren who has returned to his old home with this mysterious woman. Warren is about to inherit a fortune on his twenty-first birthday, but strange things start happening...and what secrets are hidden in that dark, old house?

  This movie is short on actual violence but long on creepy atmosphere and things that go bump in the night.  The actors are all good, but the real star is director Castle, who creates a very scary mystery with so much tension you'll be on the edge of your seat.

In true Castle-style, there is a gimmick:  Just before the final scene, a clock appears on screen to allow those too frightened to watch the end to leave the theatre - and sit in the Coward's Corner booth in the lobby. It's all in good fun and not to be taken seriously; you'll be spooked by the thrills and chuckling as soon as it's over.  A fun movie!",1090627200,31,1385,5.070484581497797

Of course, the kids watched the end, and then stayed to see the movie again to get their money back before the second showing ended!  Castle remedied this by issuing different color tickets for each show!
The plot concerns a homicidal woman seemingly killing without reason, but there is a method to her madness.  The ending is given away by some dialogue dubbing, which was not as sophisticated in 1961.
The film was a big hit. I am absolutely amazed it was not released in any home format until 2002 (DVD only).  The DVD is taken from a great print (fullscreen). A short but interesting documentary explains the Castle gimmick.
Most importantly, the DVD contains the ""fright break"". This is the minute where a clock appears on the screen, and the audience is given 60 seconds to leave the theater to get their money back.

1671309,4,B00005V4XE,"One of the most pre-eminent showmen in Hollywood, William Castle, director of such films as The Tingler (1959) and House on Haunted Hill (1959) released Homicidal in 1961, one year after the release of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece, Psycho.  Some will say it's a blatant rip off of Psycho, and others will say it's more of a homage, but either way, it's a very entertaining film.

The story starts off showing a woman, played by actress Jean Arliss aka Joan Marshall, checking into a hotel and offering a bellboy two grand to marry her.  The bellboy is naturally curious, but the lure of the humongous pile of greenbacks keeps his queries to a minimum.  They arrive at the Justice of the Peace, late in the evening, and the ceremony proceeds, only to end in a very grisly, visceral murder.  Confused?  I was too, but all will be revealed as the film progresses.  The film's plot is fairly intricate, involving murder, money, and mayhem.  The story mainly takes place in a small, southern California town focusing on the remaining family members, a brother and sister, Carl and Miriam Webster, both sharing the same father but different mothers.  Jean Arliss plays Emily, a live-in caretaker for the now elderly mute woman confined to a wheelchair that cared for Warren while he was growing up.  A dark, mysterious family secret drives the film that maintains a stranglehold on the viewer's attention until the very end.  The plot seems very convoluted at the beginning, but the pieces slowly start to fall into place.  I really don't want to get into specifics about the movie, as I fear I will give something away to someone who hasn't see the film, but I will say that Castle really was able to provide suspense pretty much throughout.  You may be able to figure out the twist ending, as I caught on to it later in the film, but it was still very creepy when all was revealed at the end.  There were some plotting gaps, and some of the exposition seemed a bit clunky and forced, but the movie appeared to have as more working for it as it did against it, helping to keep us interested through the 87 minute running time.

William Castle, being the showman he was, usually incorporated gimmicks into his movies, ranging from buzzers in theater seats to provide a 'shock' to various patrons for The Tingler (1959) to plastic skeletons suspended on a wire that would fly from the screen towards the audience for the film House on Haunted Hill (1958).  In Homicidal, the gimmick was called Fear Break.  This incorporated certificates that moviegoers would get prior to the start of the feature, which would allow people to get their money back if they got too scared and wanted to leave, but there was a catch.  The Fear Break occurred near the end of the movie, with a 45 second stop clock appearing on the screen, and voice over stating that things were going to get really scary after this point, so if you wanted to leave, do so now.  The catch to redeeming your certificate in order to get you money back was you had to stand in the Coward's Corner, near the exit, until all the movie viewers who stayed had filed out.  Given that this would probably be very embarrassing, I doubt many people tried to take advantage of this gimmick.  It was pretty obvious Castle tried to emulate Hitchcock in many areas, and there are similarities between this film and Psycho, but where Hitchcock was a master director at building up tension and suspense in often subtle methods, Castle more or less would forgo subtly for sensationalism and give it to you both barrels in the face.  Effective, yes, but, in my opinion, nowhere near as frightening.  Castle always seemed a showman first and foremost, and second, a director.

This picture on this DVD looks really wonderful, but in standard format.  I was curious as to if someone was going to go through the trouble of digitally remastering a movie, why not present it in its' original format?  Oh well...special features includes trailers for two other Castle films, Straight-Jacket (1964) and Mr. Sardonicus (1961) and a great featurette titled ""Psychette: William Castle and Homicidal"".  If you haven't seen this film before, do not watch the featurette before the movie, as it will give away the 'surprising and shocking' ending.  What would have been a great addition to this would have been a reproduction of the certificate that was handed out at the original screenings on the movie.  While this film is certainly derivative to Hitchcock's Psycho, Homicidal doesn't hold up nearly as well, but then, how many movies could?

1671311,3,B00005V4XE,"The Master Of Gimmicks; William Castle, strikes again with this movie which inevitably will lead to comparisons with PSYCHO, though Castle is no Hitch. That said, the understated chiller HOMICIDAL is one of his best movies. Marion Webster (Jean Arliss) is a Danish nurse with an American accent, who happens to have HOMICIDAL tendencies (as you'd guess by the title). This first announces itself in the scene where she disembowels the chaplain who conducts her wedding ceremony. Needless to say, the honeymoon doesn't even get underway. Pretty soon Marion is on the lam with the cops are tailing her.
Marion finds a new job caring for Helga (Eugenie Leontovich) an elderly woman confined to a wheelchair following a stroke.. Predictably Marion takes advantage of the poor old girl and physically and psychologically torments her, even though Helga tries tapping out warnings to her relatives that she is being abused by this pretty young blond. Or is she?
Of course, no Castle movie would be the same without the gimmick. That would be like Herschell Gordon Lewis without the gore and guts, or Russ Meyer without the boobies. For HOMICIDAL, Castle has inserted a 45 second ""Fright Break"" as a build up to what is to be the movies most notorious sequence to allow timid viewers to leave the room!! Add to this a laughable climactic plot ""twist"" and you have one of his most entertaining movies.

The blonde, Emily, is a nurse for a mute wheelchair bound old woman--Helga--a former nanny to Warren and Miriam, a brother and sister who grew up in the big spooky old house where Helga and Emily reside. While the murder is under investigation, it becomes apparent that Emily is up to more unsavory doings. She implicates Miriam in the murder and claims she's ""married"" Warren (a strangely unmasculine sort) leaving Miriam as the unlikely focus of the investigation. Warren and Emily are never seen together. Helga is terrified of Emily (with good reason it soon turns out) and can communicate only by pounding a doorknob on the arm of her wheelchair. Emily is threatening Helga when no one is around. There's evidence of child abuse involving Helga and ""Warren"" as a child and a hint that ""Emily"" has just returned from Denmark. The climax features Castle's gimmick of a ""Fright Break""---a clock appears on the screen giving the audience one minute to run before all hell breaks loose. This is a creepy little puzzler that is just plain enjoyable to watch. Jean Arless is dynamic as ""Emily"" and the DVD transfer is immaculate. The cast encore at the end is an eye opener.

She has a great way of half-crooning, half-hissing her lines (like the title to this review) that's fairly creepy.  The supporting cast is okay, and the location is pretty neat: Solvang in the 60's before it turned completely into a dutch-themed tourist trap.  This is one of those movies that work well with a really low budget.  Shooting in the early morning gives the dusty, deserted streets of the one-horse town a really desolate feeling that makes the shops and houses of Solvang really enjoyably creepy.
