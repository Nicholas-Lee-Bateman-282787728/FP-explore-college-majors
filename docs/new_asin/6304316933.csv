7867681,1,6304316933,"This silly video has five vignettes, all posing as letters being read by a busty erotica writer who hangs around her house half naked.  ""Games People Play"" involves a strip poker game that degenerates into truth or sexual dare, and finally just sex.  ""Chalk It Up"" has a couple playing pool for fun and finally just sex.  ""The Business Trip"" involves a female scientist at a convention who can hear the people next door in the hotel make love, she befriends them, and finally just sex.  ""Lap Dance"" has a car salesman obsessed with a stripper, who likes him too, and finally just sex.  ""Madelyn's Laundry"" involves a fashion designer who models lingerie when a stranger walks in on her, she sells him some clothing, and finally just sex.
The acting here is atrocious and the stories have no basis in reality, as well as some of the females' bust sizes.  The director is careful not to make any of the stories interesting, and succeeds.  This is softcore drivel of the lowest caliber, and makes ""Red Shoe Diaries"" look like ""Casablanca.""",1033862400,,1036,4.69060773480663
