551618,1,6303073069,"Unless you are lucky enough to own the director's cut edition of this film, I suggest that you stay away from this version. It is bad, bad, bad.  It completely stains the original concept and idea behind the immortals.  It is badly casted, badly acted, badly shot, and just bad all over.  I sat  through the whole thing once and that was it.  For some reason, the  immortals are aliens in this version, and they come to Earth to find Connor  MacLeod and kill him.  The rest of the film is just as stupid.  Even the  fighting sequences are boring. Trust me: You are better off with the  original film, or the TV show.  It may change a few things, but not as  badly as this horrible film version did. Skip it, at all costs.",947980800,,721,4.2518518518518515
551619,1,6303073069,"After Connor MacLeod killed Kurgan in 1985, he took a nap and had a horrible nightmare. He dreamed that he was not really Scottish, but from another planet, and that he could revive his teacher, Ramirez, buy just  calling his name during a Quickening. What?!  His nightmare became brutally  worse when he saw what a mockery the second movie had become.  The movie  thankfully ended and Connor finally woke up from his nightmare. Connor was  in Seacouver WA, in 1992, helping out his former pupil Duncan Macleod, in  the best sequel to the first movie- the first episode of Highlander-The  Series.",939945600,2,596,4.8316831683168315
551620,1,6303073069,This movie is a joke! I heard the bad reviews but I never thought the movie could be that bad. The first was one of my favorite movies ever. Only the true die-hard fans should even consider watching this hope-crushing  sequel. I just ordered no. 3 and I am anxious to see how that one turned  out.,934934400,2,297,4.192982456140351
551621,1,6303073069,"Okay, I'm not going to get all critical here and analyze all the little points and argue continuity etc. etc. This movie just plain sucks. If you loved HIGHLANDER, don't buy this movie. Rent it, borrow it from a friend,  be creative and make up a sequel on your own, but don't buy it. Sorry  folks, but an appearance by Connery doesn't save a movie this terrible.  Campy, hokey, cheesy and lame are good words to use in describing this  movie. Truly an insult to any fan following of the original. Amazon doesn't  have a 1/2 star rating -- if they did this movie qualifies.",932083200,,573,4.419047619047619
551622,1,6303073069,"The director and producers thought it was so terrible that the investors made them eliminate 16m of footage from Highlander II, thus screwing up the srory line and forcing them to rearrange the sequence of events. Boo Hoo  NOBODY CARES they already ruined Highlander enough with the ""immortals  are aliens"" bit. We should thank the investors for letting that  dissapointment end 16m faster. Yeah, yeah I know they  ""eliminated"" the ""alien"" thing, actually all they did  was replace the words ""Zeist"" and ""Earth"" with  ""Past"" and ""Future,"" which is worse than before  (atleast you could somewhat understand--even if it sucked--the Zeist idea,  this Past/Future crap is just mind-boggling idiocy). The extra footage is  only for those who buy the idea of the people of Earth living without  sunlight for 25 yrs. and for some reason they felt compelled to needlessly  eliminate a few scenes (some of the rather funny ones too).
Trying to  fix Highlander II is like blowing Michaelangelo's David to pieces and  saying ""Don't worry a little super glue and she'll be as good as  new."" Just give it up all ready, PLEASE!!!!!!!",915148800,,1119,4.978378378378379
551623,2,6303073069,"Initially I hated this movie with a passion. I was a big fan of the original and crushed when I witnessed this abomination. But after watching since I've grown to like it (for all the wrong reasons). This film could be  picked to pieces: Immortals are aliens, the deteriorated o-zone covered by  an electro-sheild (no sun = no food = death for the entire planet, HELLO!)  and countless others. One just has to wonder what the cookey screenwriters  were thinking when they came up with this I mean HOW COULD THEY HAVE  POSSIBLY THOUGHT THAT THIS WOULD WORK? Who knows maybe they didn't, maybe  they just thought they could come up with any old crap to appease all those  fans out there and cash in ($$$$$$$$). And how could Russell Mulcahy agree  to direct this (after all this is the same guy who turned down Rambo III  because he declared it an awful sequel after reading the screenplay--Rambo  III's not great but its The Godfather compared to this).
After  recovering from the shock of the awfull ""aliens"" explanation I  also noticed that this movie is quite funny just about all of Micheal  Ironside's scenes (esp. when he 1st enters the Sheild corp) and Sean  Connery's scenes (the Hamlet scene is halarious) are great, but that still  can't save this, but it still renders it more watchable than H3 (with nary  an original moment in sight).
Bottom line: you may HATE this at 1st (and  really do mean HATE) but give it a chance and you'll see it does have some  cool moments (the morgue scene is the best). It's just to bad that they  couldn't've been in a coherent Highlander sequel.",915148800,4,1589,4.590747330960854
551808,2,6303073069,"It looks like a poor imitation of 1982's Blade Runner.  Why this dystopia has 1940s cars mixed with 1970s cars is never explained.

It contradicts the 1986 Highlander movie by presenting a different creation story for MacLeod & Ramirez.

Christopher Lambert gives an adequate performance surpassed by Sean Connery.

551972,3,6303073069,"This movie gets a bad rap in my opinion. The original version explained that immortals were actually aliens. But this is the ""renegade version"" director's cut which reworks the story and removes the
references to planet Zeist. It also has redone special effects as well as a plethora of special features on the making
of the movie and this special edition in
particular. (That is only true for this version with this cover. The blu-ray titled ""Highlander 2: the Quickening"" with
MacLeod and Ramirez standing is the
 movie only with no special features.)
This is the best version of this movie you're probably going to get. Most likely spending a bit of money to create this version with all new effects, no money was spent when it came time to upgrade this
movie for blu-ray. The transfer is not good by any stretch of the imagination. It has problems throughout and is about the same quality as the DVD.
The only benefit I see is that the blu-ray is inherently more durable and scratch resistant. So if you like this movie and find a good price, get this version.",1444608000,7,1064,4.62962962962963

552104,4,6303073069,"Highlander for me truly began and ended with the first movie. The gathering happened and Connor came out on top thus winning the prize, end of story. With the exception of the T.V. show (which I consider to be in an alternate what if universe), I don't consider anything that came after the first movie to be officially canon because quite frankly the first movie didn't really lend itself to sequels. So with that said I actually don't hate this movie but rather enjoy it as a guilty pleasure. Sure, there are pieces that don't make sense (Ramirez), but in the spirit of Highlander there's still plenty of sword fights, quickening's, and flashbacks to different eras to enjoy all while against the backdrop of a futuristic setting.",1440720000,,732,4.771653543307087

552438,2,6303073069,"Connor Macleod [Christopher Lambert], After winning The Prize at the end of the original Highlander, is no longer an immortal and has now become an old man in the future. When the ozone layer is destroyed and the sun begins to unleash deadly radiation upon the earth, Connor and a team of scientists build a shield which shields the earth from the sun, sending the earth into a world of darkness. But meanwhile, Connor's old enemy General Katana [Michael Ironside] from Connor's home planet Zeist [?????] arrives on the earth to kill Connor once and for all. A LOT of Highlander fans will be quick to tell you that this movie was the worst of the series but after viewing Endgame [check my review for that movie], I'm here to tell you now that this movie is NOT anywhere near as bad as the fans will have you believe. Yes, it's true that this movie goes against everything that the first film's plot established being that the immortals are now aliens from the Planet Zeist [didn't Connor come from Scotland in the first film?????] and for the fact that Ramirez [Sean Connery] is somehow back in this sequel despite being beheaded in the original and yes it's true that the story for this movie really doesn't make any sense at all but i found myself being able to sit through this movie all the way until the end and while it's not as fun as the original Highlander, I find this movie watchable in spite of its numerous horrible ideas. The special effects are pretty cheesy in the original version of this movie [i heard they were updated in the two later re-cuts of this movie but i've never seen either of those yet] and the dialogue is often extremely silly but it does boast a few memorably funny moments [like the scene where Ramirez interrupts a Shakespearean play] and it does feature another memorable villain in General Katana [played well by Michael Ironside who along with Connery steals the show in this movie]. For many Highlander fans, The sole thought about the immortals being from another planet is enough to turn people away from watching this movie but luckily for those turned off by the new plot developments of this sequel, there is always the Renegade version for you to watch [and that and the 2004 special edition are the only versions available on DVD and Blu-Ray since the original version has never been released on either format and probably never will be released on DVD or Blu-Ray due to the general hatred for this version of the film]. I am not saying that this is a great film or even a good film but for what it is, It is a watchable albeit silly action/sci-fi film and it's probably best to just view this movie as a standalone chapter in the Highlander saga. Whatever version of this movie you like, You have to admit that there are way worse movies out there than this.",1346284800,,2808,4.551383399209486
552439,5,6303073069,"Four stars for this great looking futuristic environmentally theme action movie. And an extra star for the producers and director for having the tenacity to get the movie back to it's original intent. Of course, along the way they fixed up some of their own errors in judgement, too. Now the movie plays as well with the original.

When Loyds of London, who insured this movie, took over, they assembled the story in chronological order. This was not the intent of the director, who had planned the flash back style used in the first film. This type of story depends on the flashback style.

Some reviewers suggest that the additional 16 minutes are not so important. But I say, that's one sixth of an entire movie. Movies, such as ""High Noon"" have been made or broken on a mere 10 minutes of screen time.

The movie is filmed in 2:35 aspect ratio by the cameraman that went on to do ""GoldenEye"", and looks beautiful. The dramatic stylized lighting makes Lambert more intense and strikingly handsome than in the original.

He's an old man for the first 30 minutes of this movie, giving the story a real feeling of mortality vs. immortality. After killing his first attackers he is re-energized and youthened. Now he is able to find out the truth about the ozone protective shield he helped build. He'll try to get control away from the corrupt businessmen that now exploits the shield and the population of the planet. Very timely.

Lambert does all his own stunts in this movie, including the hover board flying and the ride down the top of an outside elevator. No blue screens or effects in both cases. It's great to see a large scale beautiful looking movie without the sometimes unrealistic looking CGI effects that are used today.

Sean Connery and Lambert are no longer teacher and student. Now they are equals. Culp and Cosby of the future. There's lots of humor to enjoy here, especially on Connery's part. To answer the question about how Connery came back from the dead, ""Hey.......It's a kind of magic.""

All the supporting actors are recognizable faces, with Michael Ironside using twisted humor as he stomps around the world creating havoc. Like taking a subway train on a high speed joy ride, crashing it, killing the passengers, and then announcing to the dead with glee, ""Last stop."" It's just the kind of thing a psychopath immortal would do.

As far as one reviewer complaining about Lambert ""walking up to some strange woman and has sex with her up against a stone wall."" She's the leading lady, they already established contact, went for a ride, and she watched him survive the first battle, and become young, handsome and frisky, and she needed his help to find the truth about the ozone shield. And besides, what two consenting (obviously consenting) adult mortal and immortals do, in the privacy of their own back alley in the future is their business. Plus, they got that over with quick and then could continue with the important talks of immortality, haunting memories of lost loves, and how to save the earth.

I bought all four Highlander features just now and watched them in two days, home alone, as morality tales about immortality should be watched. And for me, ""There can be only two."" The original and Highlander 2 ""The Renegade version"". I watched #2 twice, just to be sure, and enjoyed it twice.

Soon those who remember the original cut of this film will have their say, new viewers will watch it with unpolluted minds and enjoy this film on it's own merits. A large scale, quickly paced, fun and funny action tale of the future, with a theme that needs to be heeded more than ever.",1331510400,,3619,4.703001579778831
552440,5,6303073069,"This is simply the most satisfying sequel I have ever seen. It is a rare movie that can surpass the original, but Highlander 2 does just that. Don't take my word for it: the fans and critics alike have shared a rare bond over the striking class and beauty of this visual masterpiece. Yes, it's a science fiction masterpiece that puts Bladerunner to shame with the versatility of it's special effects and leaves nothing out in terms of blowing me away with it's amazing plot. In a stunning turn of events, the mystical warriors we met in the first Highlander movie are revealed to be time travelling space muslims from the planet Gorak. It takes a truly tortured genius to create a work of this magnitude. For the first time in the Highlander series, everything is just as it should be and it's no wonder this plot device became a defining feature of the Highlander movies, completely redacting the backstory of the first one and laying the groundwork for everything that came next.

There is ringing, haloing, and uneven video quality even within the film itself! Aliasing is almost constant (the jaggies) and there is lots of video noise throughout.

Now I will admit to buying it back in the day, but it was unintelligible and in the words of my film instructor Scott MacDonald ""un-figure-outable!"" This, and the third installment could have been played as previous adventures of the Highlander and other Immortals that were not included in the original, and would have worked much better. There was little comfort in the familiar characters, and the third one has complete lines lifted from the first for our new villain to spout. If someone gives this to you, thats all that it's worth. Watch for yourself, but don't say we didn't warn you. Whether or not the image has been enhanced on Blu-Ray (this is not a review of that version or the quality of any of the transfers or directors cuts) is not going to be this films saving grace.

552562,3,6303073069,"This is not the ""Highlander 2"" I'm suppose to watch.  If I'm walking down bad movie avenue, I should be seeing the infamous 90-minute theatrical cut of the film.  However, the theatrical atrocity was never released legally on DVD, and the one that's out now is the Renegade Cut, a director's reconstruction of the film with 20 minutes of extra scenes and everything apparently rearranged to reflect his true vision.  For all intentions of watching a bad movie, I failed on this venture, as I saw a manageable and overall decent redux.  I could be saying that because I never actually saw the first Highlander in full, so take this review under certain consideration.

It's the year 2024, and the entire world is covered in a barrier because the sun burned the ozone layer years earlier than Al Gore anticipated, causing harmful radiation to all.  And for some reason, the world became a very dystopian place after that. How?  A barrier that protected lives from radiation shouldn't turn the world to crap (even overtime), and I doubt the company who built the shield can monopolize the entire world without some backers from multi-billion dollar companies, nevermind it could just gouge humanity to poverty. Before I wrote this, I saw some clips from the original cut to explain why the world's in the dark...and that insulting excuse of an explanation made me realize it's best never to know.

The main Immortal, MacLeod (Lambert), grew old after the events of the first film, and he was also the supervisor of the Shield project years ago.  It turned out his aging was one of the prizes for killing the last Immortal on this planet, the other is to go back to his people; it turned out he and his old mentor Ramirez (Connery) were part of an ancient race from countless ages ago, sent to the future to duke each other out.  He tried to live and die in peace, but his old nemesis Katana (Micheal Ironside) sent his goons to attack him in the story's present, just as MacLeod had a run-in with a terrorist/totally-not-a-love-interest played by Virginia Madsen.  After MacLeod beat the turkey of them, he reformed back to his youth and is immortal again.  Huh, maybe you should've just left him to die,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Revok/dp/B00005K3NY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Revok</a>; even MacLeod and his goon called him out on that.

What followed is a few ridiculous developments in a quest to stop the bad guys, and to turn off the shield because it turned out the radiation is gone from Earth.  After MacLeod became immortal, Virginia's character just boned him on the spot; forget spending an hour to develop a romantic affair, let's just get straight to the money shot.  And when Katana decided to take matters to his own hands, MacLeod brought back his fellow dead mentor by simply calling his name.  I may not have seen the first film, but I have to say that magic maneuver was full of crap; if he could do that, why couldn't Katana just call out his goons the same way (I guess they didn't do the orange juice ritual that MacLeod and Ramirez did)?  In fact, there's a couple of things that confound me.  The movie revealed that the Immortals were from an ancient past, so how did an archaic race manage to have futuristic technology beyond present standards?  And Virginia's character recall that the Immortals were mortals in MacLeod's old world, and yet in a flashback, the ancient guardians referred to them as Immortals.  Who's messing up the details?

Even though this is the best version of the film, the story can still be contradictory and muddled at times. But I have praise its visual effects, or rather its enhanced visual effects.  For this special edition DVD, the producers decided to hire a digital FX team to visually improve the renegade cut.  While this might sounds like they're Lucas-ifying a movie to a SNAFU degree, the results of their work is more positive than I presumed.  I say that because the improvements were quite subdued, from the color correction to the additional backgrounds shots and how the planetary shield looked vivid but not so vagrant.  I would even notice some of these changes if I hadn't seen the behind-the-scenes content, which the crew explained how they took the time to make the film look better but not necessarily change it to a significant degree. With the exception of the obvious CGI plane with Ramirez riding inside, the enhanced effects didn't distract the overall movie and actually look like they could've been done back then.

Director Russell Mulcahy tried his best to make this version of ""Highlander 2"" the least atrocious that he can put together (although I'm not sure if he approved of the enhanced visuals), and while he didn't completely succeed, he manage to make this sequel manageable.  The story tends to pull magical conveniences out of its rear end, and I don't like how arrogantly comical the villains are, include the stereotypical kleptomaniac CEO of the Shield company, played by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dr-Cox/dp/B00005JNEQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dr. Cox</a>.  But the movie as a whole flows pretty well together, so I thought this was a fine effort.

It could be worse: the film could've ended with MacLeod floating in mid-air, grabbing his love-interest and the two glowing in white light until they disappear.  That would be pretty stupid if it happened, won't it?",1282435200,,5462,4.996688741721854

I guess it boils down to two simple opinions you either love it or you hate it either way I believe it is still an important movie in the series, as we all still have opinions about it after 16 years since it's original release.

I personally liked the movie. I was fortunate enough to have a bootleg screener of this movie all those years ago that contained at least 2 hrs of footage, all of which have been included in this package. The ending was a little different It saw Conner and his Lass fly off into the celestial world or something like that, which has been removed from this version. When I eventually saw the theatrical release of the Quickening (original title) half of the movie I saw on the screener was missing and the story jumped all over the place, its no wonder fans of the original were so disappointed. This version restored all that lost footage with a twist they removed all references to the Quickening and the planet Zeist. Which I feel is the only major flaw of the movie, as this caused a lot of inconsistencies around the story itself. At the end of the day this is trivial. There are some great ideas in this movie to make a great Sci Fi flick. the effects have been updated and look great, and the issues regarding the continuity between this film and the first movie is this, maybe they didn't know about their past because the prize was yet to be one?",1197504000,2,1435,4.3745318352059925
552652,2,6303073069,"OK, I loved the first movie. The Highlander (1986) is probably in my top 25 favorite movies of all time. Somehow the producers for Highlander 2 convinced Connery to reprise his role as Ramirez (probably the $3 million for 6 days works did the trick!).  Re-uniting Christopher Lambert and Connery had POTENTIAL.  Unfortunately, this potential was destroyed by a horrible script, ridiculous story, horrible new characters and poor acting. In short, they screwed this up BIG TIME.  In this edition of the DVD, many of the special effects have been digitally changed and remastered.  Although this pretty cool, it's still just putting lipstick on a pig.

What I hated:
* Really stupid is the plot line where Katana (Ironside) suddenly wants MacLeod dead after he's spent 500+ years in ""exile"" on earth. At this point in the film, MacLeod is in his 80's and at death's door anyway.  How do you expect us to believe this load of garbage?  I guess the creator's thought that if the audience were stupid enough to believe the Ramirez can come back from the dead after getting his head chopped off in the first Highlander, than the audience will believe ANYTHING.
* The movie had the look and feel of a bad comic book from the 1930's yet the year was 2024.  What the hell is that all about?
* Why did they have to show us backstory of the immortals (who they are , where they came from etc).  It ruined the mystique of the original movie!  Dumb decision on creator's part.

* Michael Ironside's character aka General Katana - Mulcahy circa 1990: ""Hey Michael, this is what I want you to do to prepare for the role of the bad guy in this film.  go watch the original Highlander and pay close attention to Clancy Brown as the Kurgan.  We want you to copy that performace. Yeah, be like the new Kurgan or someting. Yeah, that's the ticket.""  Ummm, didn't work fellas.  I freaking hated Michael Ironside in this movie. Bad, bad, bad.

* Virgina Madsen, as Louise Marcus, was the one who really killed this movie.  Her character was laughable at best and her acting was an embarrasement.  I was hoping that she bought the farm early in the movie.  Unfortunatley, we have to suffer from her performance to the very end.

* Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb aka the two idiots from the Planet Zeist that come to kill MacLeod.  They were hilariously bad but even worse, once MacLeod chops off their heads (and this becomes immortal again - wha wha what?) he his a little boom boom with Lousie Marcus, whom he met like 5 minutes earlier.  To the Director:  please delete this scene when you do the Super Special Director's Cut.

Final Thoughts:  I picked this DVD up in the bargain rack at Walmart for 5 bucks.  It was worth it to me becuase I laughed out loud numerous times when I viewed it.  Plus, there are tons of special features which were actually interesting.  In parting, it is true, there can be only ONE, and this is NOT the one. BUT, if you can pick it up for 5 bucks and you want a good laugh, Go for it!",1190592000,,2995,4.476014760147602
552777,4,6303073069,"Highlander 2: The Quikening, has now been officially renamed

to simply: Highlander 2. The edition I am reviewing, is stating, it's ""The Renegade Edition"".  However it was released only last year (2005 at the time of writing) and seems to fit with what folks are saying for this edition.  I also own the original theatrical version and it's nice that the shield is now blue as opposed to the original red, which was possibly the silliest move in the movies creation ever.  Good ridance to that.

I did like the fact that Highlander became a Sci-Fi as I'm a big fan of the genre.  This is why many folks did not like this sequal. Not necessarily because the film is bad(I for one, disagree with this), simply because it took there beloved fantasy and turned it into something which was explainable within a Sci-Fi context.  To this day, it's still the wish of the majority of Highlander fans that this film simply be dropped from the Highlander canon.

For those fans, please do take a look at this edition. The added material is fantastic and a god send for this sequal.  Now the movie has a story which follows on from the original while still keeping the planet Zeist and the explanation of where the immortals come from intact. It also has a much better beginning and keeps McCloud more authentic.

The scene were the hole in the shield is investigated is superb and the working of the Sci-Fi concepts into the story finally makes sense.  Admittedly it's not perfect sense with the feel that there should be a little more on the war on Zeist and tie-ins when McCloud is remembering that peice the build up to the creation of the shield with the events in the first movie.  However as a big fan of the movie ""Cashern"", one thing I do like in movie is when not everything is explained in detail and things just happen.  Life is like that.  Things are not always explained in painful detail and most of the time, events occur around us in ways that we are not expecting.

Overall I would actually rate this movie 3.5, however the rating system only allows full stars.  What it could still do with is more fillers(if only there was more footage).  For example, the only scene that gets on my nerves now is where all our heroes are stuck in a detention cell in a maximum security centre and a spinning blade that covers the entire ceiling is spinning down to chop them into little peices.  I liked how Sean Connerys character comes to the rescue with his style and flare, however it would have been better if they could have shown him transporting back to Zeist and a brief session with the council.

The over the top ending where guards are being fired at all over the place etc, has gone and we are presented with a straight show down and the destruction of the now defunct shield generator.

Besides the miraculous rescue scene where Connery disappears and the lack of build up in the relationship between McCloud and his new girlfriend(they begin kissing passionately after they have only just met, but I said to myself, it's because he's a recharged immortal and like Bond, has this way with women. What else could it be?)

The deleted scenes were nice and there were some really great scenes in there.  I was totally horrified however at an alternate ending scene were McCloud and his newly aquainted girlfriend turn into spirits and twirl off into the stars. Apparently that's what happens in America when the theatrical is broadcast on national television.(Fellow fans you need to see this version).

Thankfully that ending is not in either of the versions I saw and I never want to see it again.

Overall for those of you who liked the idea of the sequal despite it's terrible editing originally, you will adore this.  For those of you who didn't like the change from fantasy to Sci-Fi, you may find some good in this but are highly advised to stick to the original only.

552778,4,6303073069,"The only reason I gave this movie 4 stars in the fact I am just a big highlander fan, and Christopher Lambert fan, but honestly this is a really a 2 star movie.  This special edition of Highlander II (originally Highlander II:the quickening) is a much improved version of the redone 1996 renegade version, as far as effects, but the story is still the same junky one as then.  They reworked much of the Backgrounds and that puke red-brown skyline, which never mached the dark blue steets.  The overall film is much better quality of picture than the original renegade version as well.  Again, this is a film that was never intended to be a sequal to the first one, but unfortunately exectutives in hollywood fumble that punt return.  In all, this edition is the one Highlander fans have been waiting for of this version of the film, at least effects wise, the story is the same though. It difficult to fix something that was so flawed to begin with. Looking back on the mess, at least the original Quickening version was so outragiously bad of an adaptation that it was fun to watch for the mistakes in editing, and there were a bunch.

552779,5,6303073069,"Ok, so I know that will never happen.  H2 seems to make more sense with the idea of Immortals coming from another planet.  Since they have reworked this movie to edit out the planet, things really don't sync up anymore.  For instance, they are claiming now that the immortals are teleported from a distant past to fight in more modern times....Ok then why transport them to the year 1500??...That doesn't seem like modern times to me...and further more, the weapons they have in the distant past are better than the weapons they have in modern times.

Like I said, the movie doesn't sync up.  You need the planet Zeist back in this version.

All that aside, this DVD is worth the money for the features alone.  If you are a highlander than you need this version for all the interviews with the writers and actors.  The feature ""seduced by argentina"" is probably worth it alone for this movie.  Listening to the writers will give you a new respect for H2.  You will see that there was a spirit of a good sequel.  Because of money, H2 was destined to fail.  If this movie was actually finished, and edited by the writers and directors and now some outside party,  Highlander as we know it would be a totally different universe.

Also, Sound, and new graphics make the movie a lot more pleasing to the eye.

If you're into Sci-fi and love Highlander, you'll dig this movie.  I think the best thing about Highlander is it's like a choose your own adventure story.  You the viewer have the ability to make out whatever outcome to the Highlander saga with the various sequels that have come out.",1150761600,5,1589,4.538732394366197
552780,4,6303073069,"Yes, the first versions of Highlander 2, even the one in big screen were not so believable and even stupid for the idea of immortals being aliens. But here on the Renegade version, the story is very different. In time, I don't believe, as the other writers here that Highlander 2 are so bad like this. Of course, Highlander 1 is a truly masterpiece, but personally, I think Highlander 2 is, at least, a funny and interesting movie. The science fiction pack is only a background to a bigger question about the future of Earth. The message that Sean Connery leaves to us in the ventilator scene is truly inspiring.

Well, back to the Renegade, the story is very changed compared with the other versions, and make this movie an acceptable sequence. The imortals doesn't came from Zeist anymore, so the story is on Earth, on the year 1500. The ressurection of Ramirez is because the power of magic, probably because of the quickening that brought Connor back to his immortality. And in a personal level, I think Ramirez got lost somehow when he was transported into the future. And about the future, Davis and Panzer, the producers, explains why the third and fourth sequels returns to the years before the shield from 2. Katana have the ability to see the future, so he travels to the future where Connor is the last immortal on Earth. When the shield is broken and the life in planet is back to normal, everything fades, Connor wins the right to return to the past and reborn in some years ago and then comes the events we saw in the first Highlander. That's why Brenda dies by a car crash in the third movie and not by radiation. The shield doesn't exist anymore. Yes, the story on Highlander 2 annuls itself, like if never happened.

Think: it's a dark future where the shield exists. Connor only can win the right to return to his time and reborn after some years if he kills the last immortal of the future. So he destroy the shield, it doesn't exist anymore. But it was there on the beginning. If he hadn't destroyed the shield, the story would certainly be very different. You just have to accept there were changes in the world, after the destruction of the shield. Like if this never had taken place before. It have a lot of science fiction on this movie. In the end of the movie, you just get on the conclusion that he returned to the past and the dark future of the shield is simply erased from existence. That's why the story of the movie annuls itself.

But how could Connor to have a life and a past on the distant future if he travelled through time? That's also easy, because the plot on the movie uses the same idea than in Back to the Future Part 2, witch is, the fact of you travelling to the future will not affect your existence on Earth.

Of course, the plot is not so well written, but the story in this Renegade version became an OK story and turns to a more believable version than the others. There are some low points and some questions that remained unanswered, of course, but in the end its a good movie. Lambert is excellent back to his role, Connery is wonderfull as usual and Ironside is either funny and evil, one of the best actings of the movie, he alone have some of the best moments of the film. Ah, I couldn't resist to talk about the score after Ramirez and Connor got shot by security guards. It's very funny!

All in all, this movie it's not a beauty, but it's not the beast that everyone are shouting around. A good one to watch in the afternoons or in a rainy day.",1136851200,6,3504,4.401234567901234

Highlander 2 is that, a science fiction story. Of course this cannot be considered in the usual mithology, because this is not our reality. It's more like what happened if Connor, Ramirez and Katana had be thrown in a dimension in witch Connor's last wife and the rest of the world had died by radiation.

The story is good, a little slow, but flows nice. The science fiction plot is interesting, the atmosphere is a little like Blade Runner. And Ironside here are deliciously sadic and insane, he's still evil, but funny at the same time.

Though in my opinion how they knew the difference between Connor receiving the 'Prize' or just another Quickening is beyond me.  I felt that a sequel to ""Highlander"" would be fine, as long as it could equal or surpass the original film.  In 1991, ""Highlander 2: The Quickening"" was released to theaters and fans of the original could hardly wait to see this movie, yes even the nay-sayers were excited.  How could they not be, I mean, with the return of Christopher Lambert as Connor MacLeod, Sean Connery as Ramirez, and adding Michael Ironside as a new villanous Immortal named General Katana, plus ""Highlander"" director Russell Mulcahy helming once again, what could possibly go wrong?  Sadly, the answer would be, a lot.  The original film as covered in previous reviews by other viewers, was a slap in the face to fans of the original film, and even to the cast and crew.  Apparently, the movie studio became too involved in the filmmaking process, leaving audiences with a terrible movie, with a horrible story, and shoddy special effects.  In the original theatrical release of ""Highlander 2: The Quickening"", the Immortals are said to be from a planet called Zeist, and they fled their homeplanet after a civil war erupted and came to Earth to prosper.  This revelation completely alienated most of the 'Highlander' fans, and the ones that weren't alienated probably aren't true fans.  In 1997, director Russell Mulcahy returned once again to the 'Highlander' world, editing out any references to the planet Zeist or having the Immortals be aliens.  Upon completion of this newly cut version Russell released ""Highlander 2: The Renegade Version"", a more entertaining film than the original version of ""Highlander 2"", yet still the continuity was messed up.  Then once more in 2004, Russell Mulcahy returned one more time to ""Highlander 2"" and gave all of the special effects an upgrade that they were sorely lacking, and re-edited some of the scenes again, yet sadly, this film still does not flow with the rest of the films in the 'Highlander' series.  Now that I have brought you all up to speed regarding the changes made to this film through various editions, I will fill you in on the basic story for this latest 'special edition' of ""Highlander 2: The Quickening"".

""Highlander 2: The Quickening"" takes place in the year 2024, and Connor MacLeod is living life as a normal man, since it seems the 'Game' is now complete and there are no more Immortals to vanquish, he has been allowed to grow old naturally.  In the time that has passed since the end of ""Highlander"", Connor has become somewhat of an environmentalist and has created a force shield that will protect us from the sun's harmful rays, because of the complete destruction of the ozone layer.  However, Connor is no longer in control of his company, and a new evil organization is running the shield.  Though he created the shield for good, it never lets any sunlight in, not even filtered light, so the world has become a bleak place, and the people are desperate and filled with hatred.  But a team of scientists, or eco-terrorists in this case, believe that the ozone layer has healed itself and that there is no longer any need for the force shield, and seeks to destroy it, in hopes of bringing back the sunlight and hope to the people.  At the same time this is occurring an Immortal has been sent from the past to face Connor MacLeod and take away the coveted 'Prize'.  As Connor fights to 'keep his head' and the 'Prize', he also attempts to help the leader of the scientists (Virginia Madsen) disable the force shield he created.  But the evil Immortal, General Katana (Michael Ironside), doesn't care about anything more than taking Connor's head, and claiming the 'Prize'.  To survive, Connor must call on an old friend to aid him in this time of need, however as the saying goes,""In the end, there can be only one.""

When I first watched this sequel I saw the original theatrical release, not knowing that on DVD the 'Renegade Director's Cut' had been released.  So, initially I hated this movie, because I thought it destroyed the mythology of the Immortals by taking an easy way out and having them be aliens, instead of just a mysterious race of humans.  But then I saw the 'Renegade Director's Cut', and I was somewhat happier, though still the continuity is screwed up when viewed in line with the original ""Highlander"" and then the other 2 sequels, ""Highlander: The Final Dimension"" and ""Highlander: Endgame"".  Even though the 'Renegade Version' is better, and the special effects and some other scenes have been fixed for this new special edition, ""Highlander 2: The Quickening"" is still a troublesome follow-up that never fully fits into the 'Highlander' series.  Though, if viewed as a standalone, almost alternate reality 'Highlander' universe, then the film could be enjoyable, but that's too much hassle.  Overall, it's an average standalone movie which is why I gave it 3 stars, but when viewed in line with the rest of the series, it is really only worth 1 or 2.

""Highlander 2: The Quickening"" is rated R for violence, language, and brief sexuality.",1126224000,13,5563,4.868504772004242
552783,1,6303073069,"I was always a fan of the original Highlander, and when I heard there was to be a sequel (even though I wasn't sure how that could have been done since MaCleod had already won ""The Prize""), I was truly stoked to see it!

Imagine my heartfeld disappointment to learn that the fools who wrote this film deceided to explain the Immortals as being from ""The Planet Geist"".

It is my earnest hope that someone has given them a solid punch in the face for doing that!!

Did they really think this was a good idea?

I can just imagine some Hollywood office, where some idiotic fools (like the ones responsible for Lawnmower Man 2) came up with the idea....""Hey, J.B., how about we try to explain the Immortals as being....ALIENS!!!"" ...""Hank, BUBBIE...that's SENSATIONAL!""....""And how about an environmental angle...such as, say, having Macleod saving the world by designing a shield to protect the world because the ozone layer has dissolved away"".....""Hank, BUBBIE! You're a GENIUS! That can be what the whole ""Prize"" thingy was about, oy vey!"".

So the idea of the Planet Geist was born.

Note that all subsequent Highlander films (as well as the series) DO NOT mention anything about ""Aliens from the Planet Geist""...nor should they, as Highlander 2, even though it starred  Chritopher Lambert and Sean Connery, has been officially stricken from the Highlander canon, IE it's simpley treated like it never existed (and rightly, rightly so!).

So, if you're a fan of the original Highlander film and have never seen this one, do yourself a favor and avoid it, as it is not considered an official part of the ongoing Highlander storyline.

Part 2 sucked. Aliens. Hokey pseudo-science. Jeez. For me, the worst offences of the movie are threefold. #1. Connor rejuvenating. Huh?! Gaaawwd! And in a ball of fire no less. #2. So all it takes for Ramirez to come back is for Connor to call his name? Goofy. #3. What was all that crap Ramirez was talking about in the room with the big fan about to cut all their heads off? And besides, he's about to die, and Connor has so little to say about it, and doesn't look particularly distressed. But who cares, since he's scoring with what's-'er-name after offing the Mickey Mouse of villians and saving the ozone layer? Riiiiight.

This was the original theatrical version, think of it as version 1.0. Several years later came Higlander 2: The Renegade Version. This was a director's cut with a reworked story, think of it as version 1.5. Now there's Highlander 2: The Special Edition. This is basically the renegade version polished up; which was needed because the renegade version was thrown together so sloppily, think of it as version 1.7. With that being said, what can you really say about a film that has been reworked twice. Although this is the best Highlander 2 there can be it still cannot undo the obvious mistake they made with this film, they tried to explain the origin of the immortals. They completely destroyed the mystery and mystique of the concept with this movie. If you watch the extras, you can actually hear the producers admit to this mistake. They even admit how they tried to explain it wasn't the best choice either, which I'll not argue. The original idea was just plain stupid, while the reworked version was more strange than stupid it wasn't quite enough to redeem this film. This polished up version adds a lot of visual appeal to it, but not much else. Most of the changes are subtle, but there's some very noticeable ones as well; like the force field.

Reading about it told the story of a battle between Mulcahey and the film's backers who eventually took it away from him and re-cut it before release.

 While not perfect, this redone version (further enhanced in this release with new more professional looking special effects, is quite decent and very stylized. People who are commenting on it may never have seen the ""Renegade"" version. It's not as good as the first film. But it's got a lot of the same overtones. MacLeod's battle with the two bird-like assassins from the future is just as classic as anything in the first film. Sean Connery adds a tremendous presence to the proceedings. Is it perfect? No. Is it worth checking out as a fun film and evidence of Mucahey's amazing visual directorial style? Absolutely.

552846,1,6303073069,"Face it... no matter how many ways you dice up a rotten tomato, it is STILL a rotten tomato! The producers of Highlander 2 seem to have ignored this fact in their greedy attempt to redeem this much-hated sequel to the popular franchise and win back the fans' hearts (and their wallets).

 Using state-of-the art digital effects, the filmakers have ""re-imagined"" the visual effects for the film to bring them up to current standards (sound familiar?). They have made a few trims and edits here and there to discard some of the more ridicluous plotlines. For example, the master shot of planet Zeist has now been digitally recomposited to make it appear as though we are really on Earth in the distant past. Sounds like an improvement, right? The next shot clearly shows the immortals gathered in the wreckage of some kind of crashed spaceship or industrialized vehicle with its burnt-out metalllic hull and the battle sequences showcase General Katana's high-tech henchmen and artillery. Did technology somehow de-evolve from the ancient past or am I missing something here?

 Ultimately a few new composite effect shots and some minor edits don't disguise the fact that Highlander 2: The Quickening is a terrible film. All of the latest whiz-bang optical effects cannot change the fact that the STORY should never have been written in the first place. Even George Lucas cannot figure out how to improve upon an actor's lousy performance which is something else that prohibits Highlander 2 from ever attaining any kind of so-called ""redemption"" since we are still subjected to Michael Ironside's laughable over-the-top performance as a poor-man's Kurgan and Christopher Lambert doing his impersonation of a wheezing old guy with aesthma.

 There are two documentaries called ""Seduced By Argentina"" and ""The Redemption of Highlander 2"" in which everyone from the Producers, Director, Cast and Crew, who spend too much time graphically describing getting air-sickness and vomitting in barf bags on the flight to Argentina, do nothing more than try to sell us on the idea of their original ""vision"" as it was intended to be seen in a desperate sales pitch that comes across as nothing more than making excuses and blaming everyone from the bonds company pulling the plug on the production to blaming the Argentinian work ethic.

Back to ""H 2"" on present day (??) Planet Zeist, Kitana decides, for some untold reason, to send a couple of assassins to kill MacLoud on Earth, why?? who knows...anyway, MacLoud is somehow able to kill these two guys and again somehow, he is regenerated back to youth and immortal again...they tried to explain it in the movie, but I got more confused..
Oh and let's not forget that before their capture on Zeist, MacLoud and Ramirez engaged in some kind of magical ceremony named the ""Quickening"" in which, if MacLoud ever needed help from Ramirez, to only speak his name and he would come to him. Thus the name of the movie, but is this ""Quickening"" different from the ""Quickening"" in the first movie, where Ramirez is teaching MacLoud how to tap into the lifeforce and heartbeat of the elk and he exuberantly runs around as if he were the elk.

It should have been cut from someone's production budget.  It is a totally senseless film which should never had been made, much less any of the other sequels.  Let's think about some obvious problems between this film, the original and later sequels.
1) the original film deals with human beings who are born immortal and must fight to the death with other ""Immortals"" to gain the knowledge and wisdom of the ages and more importantly mortality - a regular human existence, hence the phrase: ""there can be only one,"" which eventually Conan MacLeod became.
2) the sequel - (the quickening) It is now 1999, earth is decimated from ozone depletion and an aged Conan MacLeod is no longer the last of his kind when two fellow breathren are dispatched from the planet Zeist to kill him.  Zeist??? Zeist??? Where did that come from?  Yes all of a sudden Immortals come from a distant galaxy far far away, oh sorry that's another movie.  Conan fortunately kills these two bad Immortals and all of a sudden he's young and Immortal again!
Wait a minute remember I told you in the first film, Conan became a regular joe after killing Rogan, the second to last of his kind.  You see the dilemma, after all, the inhabitants of Zeist still existed or else they couldn't have sent anyone to kill Conan.  OOPS, it seems Conan is not the last of his kind after all!  But then how could he have become mortal after killing the last of his kind and then suddenly became immortal again?  Zeist was teaming with life and Immortals so what's going on here?  In the theatre when I first saw this sequel, I just kept saying to myself ""OH... MY... GOD""
3) Third Sequel, okay, here we go again.  This was the Highlander movie sequel with Mario Van Peebles that just totally dismissed the second film as if it had never been made. But there's still a problem because in the 3rd film Conan (Lambert), even though during all this time, he has killed every other immortal and has won the prize and is now mortal, Mario (an evil Immortal) along with two other evil Immortals have been frozen in ice.
So how could Conan have become mortal by killing the last of his kind with these three Immortal Popcycles still technically in existence?  I mean just because they're frozen, in suspended animation, does that mean they don't count in the grand scheme of things in the Universe? To give the Quickening one star is way too much of a rating and also too much for any of the other sequels, even the one including that wannabe Immortal from the TV series.

  The story is self-contained and should be viewed on its own merits, as it has absolutely nothing to do with the continuity of the other Highlander films! After all, the producers wanted to make a picture that was as far from being a rehash of the original as possible. They sure succeeded!
  Verdict:- A Great Movie, just not a Highlander movie. Enjoy!",1003104000,2,768,5.358333333333333

""There should have been........only one!""
The whole thing about them being aliens **ruined** the whole movie IMO.  I am glad they took it out in this edition.  The rest, while not the best is still great action movie.",1001635200,,292,4.596153846153846
553007,1,6303073069,"This is movie is terrible. It is a lot more scientific than the other ones or the show. It focuses too much on the fact that the sun has been destroyed and the sky is red. The first half hour of the movie shows Christopher Lambert's character (Connor MacLeod) as a old man. Saying that he has claimed the prize and lived his life up to become an old man. Then it tosses u a completely different story then from the first one. It says that Connor MacLeod and Juan Ramirez(Sean Connery) are punished by becoming immortal and being sent to the future as in the renegade version and to earth from the planet Zeist in the original. And it claims that there are more immortals form the Planet Zeist or from the past that can challenge MacLeod thus making him immortal again. And then MacLeod can call Juan Ramirez even though he's been killed to help him. I don't recommed this movie.

553008,3,6303073069,"Highlander 2 was originally based around the concept that the Immortals (including Connor McCleod and Ramirez)were, in fact, aliens from a distant planet known as Zeist. Only when they were exiled from their homeland to Earth were they cursed with immortality that can only be taken from them if their heads are cut from their bodies. It was an attempt to give fans of the first film what they wanted - an explanation on why Immortals are, well, immortal. But these seemingly good intentions didn't work out so well in the end. The explanation did not have to be THAT far-fetched, guys. Of course, that is why the television series and the following two films completely ignore this concept. In movie history, I don't believe there has ever been a sequel that has been so ignored by other films in the series. Highlander 2 is almost a ""what if?"" scenario that strays from the original formula before going right back again with Highlander 3 (though at its core, 3 is a much worse film).
The original cut of Highlander 2 was a mess, and not the version the directors, writers, and producers had been shooting for. This so-called Renegade Version revisits the material and improves upon it vastly by putting scenes in their proper order and by inserting scenes that were missing altogether the first time around. This is almost a DIFFERENT film. And, of course, almost abashedly and apologetically, the filmmakers have decided to lop out all references to the origins of Immortals as pertaining to another planet in a distant galaxy. Instead, the scenes that take place on Zeist are now supposedly part of a lost time and place here on Earth, which makes absolutely no sense at all given that there are spaceships, teleporters, holograms, machine guns and such. Though I strongly feel that the explanation for the Immortals is weak and, certainly, a mistake, I think the Renegade Version's attempt to hide from this is also a mistake. It makes the story, oddly enough, even MORE far-fetched, and confusing as well to any newcomers. But, in truth, this Renegade Version was made for the die-hard fans, so newcomers should probably not apply to begin with.
Aside from this brand new flaw in the narrative, Highlander 2 is certainly improved from its earlier incarnation. Still, the fact remains that this is a fairly mediocre film at its core, and no amount of revisions can undo this. It lacks the emotion of the original, and increases the campiness factor tenfold. The futuristic setting is been-there and done-that science fiction tripe, and detracts from the originality of the overall premise. The best thing about Highlander 2 remains the same as before, though, and his name is Sean Connery. His return is hard to swallow given he met his end in the first flick, but it's not something I question given that he almost single-handedly saves the film. He and Christopher Lambert share a grand chemistry, and it returns here. Connery also takes credit for the most comical and delightful bits of the film.
All in all, Highlander 2 is to be taken as a ""what if?"" in the series and then you're expected to forget about it completely. If one watches it with that in mind, it has its appealing moments. This new version, in particular, brings more to the table and imbues Highlander 2 with a tiny bit more of that Highlander essense that was lacking at first. When it comes down to it, though, Highlander 2 and Highlander 3 are disposable, and the only true sequel to the original is Endgame. This DVD is a nice addition for the less-picky Highlander zealots, though, and the commentary track is fun and enlightening, and so is the featurette.",998265600,5,3640,4.788553259141494

Second the highly profitable, for some, invention of a solar screen for the earth that creates a mess in twenty-five years, a mess that has to be corrected by removing the shield, an action that the private corporation that installed it refuses. The action is just the same as in the first film : fencing and beheadings. The ecological stake is interesting and looks like a denunciation of private concerns when we are confronted with the future of the earth, a future that should always be controled by the people, and not by private interests or by super-heroes.

553011,2,6303073069,"First of all, the original ""Highlander"" was no masterpiece. With that out of the way, let's talk about this sequel. Christopher Lambert has never been a good actor, save maybe his role in ""Mortal Kombat"". His weak attempt to play an old man really hurts ""Highlander 2"", though his acting when he becomes young again is a least passable. Sean Connery just seems to be around to use up time. Ditto for Virginia Madsen's charactor. Canadian actor Michael Ironside does a good job as a psychotic killer, and easily turns in the best performance.
The flow of the movie isn't worked very well. You have scenes that occur ridiculously. And even if you buy that ludicrous ""Planet Zeist"" idea, it still doesn't work with the first movie(though better than the ""Renegade Edition""). But, whether you wish to admit it, if this movie hadn't been made, the TV series wouldn't have either.
So, what is it that saves ""Highlander 2:The Quickening""? Well, I agree with a couple previous reviewers that lots of parts are unintentionally funny, especially Connery and Ironside's scenes. This doesn't actually save this movie, but it is bearable,unlike the abomination that is ""Highlander 3:the final dimension"".",989452800,,1191,5.02020202020202

When they saw the final cut of this film did they actually think this film was any good? I can't even begin to understand the minds of the morons in charge of this movie. The plot twist about the immortals being aliens could have worked if done properly. I remember seeing Highlander (which is a far superior movie) and wondering were they came from. The alien (and subsequent time travel) story could have worked but didn't because the writers were narrow sighted and did a halfway job. The alien thing worked for Dragonball, it could have worked here, but it failed terrably. The one of the worst sequels ever (but not worse than Highlander 3 or Lawnmower Man 2). I liked how the movie was true to the main story of Highlander, but hated how it butchured the flashbacks and history behind Highlander. The best scene was when Connor became young again and the scene when Connor and Ramerize meet again. Overall, a large dissapointment.

That appears to story line. But this film is so incredibly boring that its very easy to lose track of its tedious, hopeless, confussing plot. This movie is so bad that its almost worth watching just to see how bad a movie really can be. Its full of many elements that totally contadict the original and make it all the more confussing. Not even Sean Connery's performance was able to save it. You really have to wonder what brand of cigarettes the producers were smoking when they approved this script.

I'm all for not harming the environment more than is absolutely necessary, but I wish Hollywood would leave the political/environmental issues out of what's supposed to be entertainment.
