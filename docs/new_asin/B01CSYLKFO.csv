The whole movie was near misses of them getting together and a couple parts really stupid things happened; somehow it seemed kind of trite except for the way they cared for their kids. Anyway, you'd enjoy it if you like romantic movies and had seen everything else in that genre you wanted to see and this was all there was to choose from. Just didn't really have anything special about it and half way through I'm like 'is ANYTHING ever going to happen in this movie?'",1512432000,,498,4.544444444444444
