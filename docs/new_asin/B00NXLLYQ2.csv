6684297,5,B00NXLLYQ2,"First let me say that I've been a hardcore Stones fan since 1965 when I was 10 years old and heard Satisfaction for the first time while riding in a top-down Caddy convertible. One of the seminal musical moments of my life! The Stones are one of the bands that inspired me to seek a career in the music biz.
Until I moved to Los Angeles in 1979 I wasn't anywhere near a venue the Stones performed at so for me this is a real treat.
Granted some shots may seem a bit blurry and dark but this concert wasn't ""lit"" for video. This is how the lighting director for this concert did the show. As a retired LD let me say the video looks freakin' great considering the source material they had to work from. This is before VariLites and lasers...the state-of-the-art lighting at the time were Par-Cans. Also before shows were specifically lit for video. Concert and video lighting are melding now but back then they were completely different.
My hubby is the sound guy in the family and he thinks the sound on this is excellent. The audio options are a bonus and how they pulled them all off is beyond me. The best option for me is the DTS sound through my Blu-Ray player, Yamaha home theater receiver and Polk speakers.
This is RAW Stones at their best during the ""Goats Head Soup"" era, and when Ronnie Wood first joined the band. Mick's energy and stage presence show why he's the best front man in the history of rock. The only word of caution is some tunes may contain language not suitable for younger audiences ( hello Star Star ).
I know it's only rock 'n roll but I LIKE IT!!!!

Had to come back to say RIP Bobby Keys - you will not be forgotten - December 2,2014
We lost another long-time Stones collaborator today - RIP Ian McLagan - December 3, 2014",1416614400,41,1753,4.344512195121951
6684298,5,B00NXLLYQ2,"A great window on the raw and relentless energy of the 1975 Stones. On this tour they affirmed the arrival of the punk rock era, they took off their shirts, they shouted, shot dope, f**ked everything in sight, yet unlike new punk bands, they also turned up like professionals and delivered spectacularly entertaining shows to giant crowds of kids, who were most all under 30.

They stripped down the music, with an adrenaline, whiskey and coke fueled sexiness, that hadn't yet seen any self-reflective solo albums or autobiographies. There were no phone cameras, not even jumbo video screens. There were no online voting for which song to play gimmicks, or B-stages, or ""Tongue-pits"" yet. And while all those things are great now, it's a different time, so watch this show in context, and dig it!

In 1975, by bringing Ron Wood into the band, they became more raw and spontaneous, and had alot more fun. I saw them a few days later (or was it earlier) in Fort Collins, where Elton John famously got up onstage with them,  but stayed too long (3 songs), and was pointed to the exit - to the great pleasure of the 60,000 fans. It was a crazy spontaneous tour, every bit as great as the 1972, or 69 tours. And also as great as Some Gilrs 78, No Security, Bridges to Babylon, or the many other tours.

As great as their songs and videos are at home, the Stones are 10 times more impactful to see in person. The way they tune-in to every crowd, every show, every song is something that must be felt to understand. They operate on a visceral level. They do not perform the songs like the record the channel them fresh each time. They have always had those qualities, and always will... it became a part of their DNA in the 60's, and is part of each player, including all the sidemen and women now.

If you haven't seen them, still go see them. Even go see Lisa Fisher or Tim Reis, or Charlie watts, or Bill Wyman and you will see what i mean.",1416528000,24,1936,4.426966292134831
6684299,5,B00NXLLYQ2,This is the Stones at their best. I love these older performance - they are too old now and this way i can enjoy what they use to be.,1416441600,3,133,3.6206896551724137
6684300,4,B00NXLLYQ2,"The Stones have been a major part of my life for the last forty years and I've read endlessly about concerts, dates and songs performed hoping that one day the Stones would follow the examples of Bob Dylan and Neil Young and release the archives thinking there should be some superb stuff here. This to say the least is rough and raw but I'm sad to say that for me is a bit of a letdown. Mick's singing is more like shouting barely comprehensible lyrics that when you can make out the odd line here and there bear little or no resemblance to the order in which their supposed to appear. They are lines which seem to be thrown in totally at random with little or no structure to them. The quality of the film itself is good but not great and the musicianship of Keith and Woody being the highpoint. Ollie Brown's percussion sometimes seems to drown out Charlies competent drumming. Still there are things here to keep the die hard fans happy not least Honky Tonk Woman complete with three verses. Not one for the casual  listener. Further listening may change my views.",1416355200,3,1068,4.476923076923077
6684301,4,B00NXLLYQ2,"Haven't seen the DVD yet, but I was at one of these Forum concerts and even in the last row behind the stage it was a great concert. I also saw them at The Cow Palace a few days before, although my two favorite Stones concerts were Winterland Arena in San Francisco in 1972 (4,500 capacity) and Brixton Academy in London in 1995 (1,500 capacity...)",1416355200,,348,4.369230769230769
6684302,5,B00NXLLYQ2,"wow thank you rolling stones and amazon !
i just got this historic concert  dvd last night and at 6 am i went to watch it
i must say the quality and sound are GREAT !!
hats off to the production and sound crew for restoring the great sound and video quality
this is one of the best live shows the rolling stones have even done. 1975 was the best year in my books
and i was not able to attend bc my mom said i was too young at the time ( 13 yrs old)
so i am happy to actually have a great piece of history now on dvd and will play all the time
also what a great value",1416268800,12,566,3.639344262295082
6684303,3,B00NXLLYQ2,"I'm a big Rolling Stones fan.  I'd heard about these L.A. concerts for years from friends.  So naturally I put in my order ahead of the release time right away.  I got it from Amazon yesterday, and I immediately popped it into the 52 inch HDTV.  I found it to be a lackluster set.  I'm hoping I'll like it more on repeat viewings.  There are some interesting song choices we don't always see, and a few players we don't often hear.  I got the Hampton DVD too, but I haven't seen it yet.  I've already heard it (live album), and saw the ON TV broadcast, but that was decades ago.  I'm hoping that will be like the Anaheim set I saw, with Jagger jumping around like a kangaroo on crack.  Four Flicks remains as the best Stones DVD set to get.",1416268800,3,740,4.184397163120567

6684309,3,B00NXLLYQ2,I attended one of the performances at the Forum and it was fantastic.  I don't feel that this film captures the power of the monstrous mechanical stage or the marvelous sound of the Stones that night.  Perhaps it's due to film instead of video or less-than-pristine sound.  There are better Stones DVDs than this one.,1466726400,2,317,4.7272727272727275

6684334,2,B00NXLLYQ2,"Not thrilled, I did not expect top quality, but it was very fuzzy. Mick was not at his best, seemed to by screaming his lyrics rather than singing. He ran around the stage like he was lost - maybe too many drugs before the show? The musicians were excellent, but overall disappointing.",1429660800,,285,4.5

6684355,5,B00NXLLYQ2,"A really good show - two releases in, this 'From the Vault' series from the Stones' archives is proving to be well worth it - affordable dvd's/blu-rays of some prime-era Stones.  This1975 show is quite long - about 2 1/2 hours+ of material.  The source tape has some of the limitations you'd expect (at times) but as a historical document, this can't be beat.  I really dig the tip-down/bouncy stage they used on that tour - hard to imagine that any band would use something this potentially risky today.  I can't wait to see what they release next on DVD in this series - maybe some Exile-era stuff (I hope).",1420243200,,609,4.509090909090909
6684356,3,B00NXLLYQ2,Unless you are in love with Mick Jaggar's body don't watch this. The camera is on Mick 80% of the time even when he not singing. Most of the guitar solos are not shown. However the audio is awesome. Ron Wood tears it up.,1419897600,,220,4.0227272727272725
6684357,5,B00NXLLYQ2,"It ain't perfect, but it is a perfect snapshot of a tour long neglected. This is the last time I remember seeing Mick flat out rocking and urging his band on to new heights. This is a funker, mid-70s version of the band and a few of the songs don't quite come off, while others really cook. We're lucky to have this at all. It's reported that they used Don Kirshner's Mobile Unit to tape this. Another report says it was available soon after the concert on the long dormant UMatic videocassette format. At any rate we finally have a glimpse of what a 1975 concert was like in all it's Billy Preston monster afro glory. The video is fine, but they're not releasing it in BluRay probably due to the technical limitations. Personally I would have gone for the BluRay for the audio quality alone, but this is what it is. And it's great.",1419811200,,832,4.374193548387097

6684361,2,B00NXLLYQ2,"Im a huge and loyal Stones fan the last 30 years but just started buying concert blu rays/dvds in the last two years.  If you own all the other Stones concerts buy this solely for the good audio and excellent set list.  However, and I say this understanding this concert is 40 years old and giving the Stones a lot of slack...the video is AWFUL and unwatchable.  Not only blurry but horrible camera angles, etc. This dvd would be great to play while cleaning the room next to the room it is playing in.  If you don't own their other shows....start with ""Some Girls"" from 1978... then ""Ladies and Gentlemen"" from 1972 and also the ""Crossfire Hurricane"" documentary, which is a very well produced, tight documentary that does justice to the gravity of the 50 yr plus legacy of the band.  Finally, the other ""From the Vault"" blu ray/dvd just released, from the '81 tour at the Hampton Coliseum, is excellent borh in video and audio quality.",1419292800,4,937,4.586826347305389

The show I saw was about 3 weeks before this LA show, and the LA show is almost identical to the one I saw (they played ""Let it Loose"" at the show I saw, and I remember it because it was the best song they performed at the show).  This tour was the Stones at the height of their popularity in the States.  They made Page One of both NYC daily newspapers, and the show was more of an event than a concert.  After the disappointing lighting of the 1972 tour, this tour was compared to a Broadway production when the show was reviewed.  The DVD is excellent, the DTS surround sound is clear, and the photography is great.  The music is 2/3 Mick Taylor era songs, and the concert is longer than most.  You don't have to wait half an hour for the stage to open, like we did at MSG. It's Only Rock and Roll.",1418428800,2,934,3.9838709677419355

This concert captures the stones at to me was the beginning of their second great run,I've had the audio version of these Forum shows for years and always wondered what the Lotus stage looked like unfolding to the strains of fanfare for the common man,I'm so glad they've started releasing all the vault series shows as I've collected bootlegs for years it's great for any fan that was too young or not near a big city to catch good bands,the color restoration is beautiful!! As with any video occasionally your gonna get some color bleed or lines on distant shots but it's not that big of a deal,I'm 51 years young and still see as much rock and roll shows as I can and bands today could take a lesson from these guys,they gave you your money's worth,I've just ordered Hampton 1981 and can't wait to see that as it's another high point for this band,enjoy",1417824000,3,869,4.54140127388535

6684381,5,B00NXLLYQ2,"I wondered if this tour was as  moving as I remember. It was. If you go to a concert to hear the music rather than just seeing the band, this concert won't disappoint. The musical interplay is ferocious and passionate. The camera angles for this video are dated and limited by the technology of its time. Still, the show was the Rolling Stones at their torrid best. And... ""Charlie's good tonight, ain't he?""",1417305600,2,408,4.589041095890411
6684382,4,B00NXLLYQ2,"Great. If you love the Stones, this is a must have. It is first and foremost a historical snapshot of the band from their best decade ... the1970s. The music is almost secondary; the value of this video is witnessing the visual spectacle that was the Stones' 1975 tour of America. I actually saw them on opening night in Baton Rouge and then again in Greensboro towards the end of the tour in 1975.  It was more of a circus show than a riveting musical performance, in fact I remember thinking at the time that they were ""done"" as a band without Mick Taylor's brilliant lead guitar. Jagger seemed more interested in being a drag queen than a rock singer and had adopted a nasal quasi-reggae style that was a far cry from his bold delivery in 1969 & '72. But with the hindsight of history, I have become rather fond of this tour and now view it as a necessary phase for the band. Without the back-sliding decadence of the 1975 & 1976 tours, they probably would have never felt the need to get back to the basics of rock and deliver the excellent ""Some Girls"" and ""Tattoo You"" LPs. (How's that for a cheap justification of mediocrity?)  Unfortunately this show from the 12th may have been the most lackluster of the 5-night stand at the Forum, with the 13th being possibly the most exciting show from the entire tour. (audio cd is available from the 13th show as a combo-pack with this video). That being said, the sound and video on this dvd from 7/12/75 are both of stellar quality here, and since it's the only video document from this epic tour don't hesitate ... buy!",1417132800,28,1570,4.447916666666667

6684384,5,B00NXLLYQ2,"A good solid 2 hour performance that features Billy Preston on piano! The band is typical Stones, not extremely tight in those days but delivers the energy in their playing. A good show with great songs, you just don't want to hit the ""stop"" button once you put it in!",1416614400,,268,4.38
8680975,3,B00NXLLYQ2,"Nice live performance, but  I wish they would remaster the video DVD for a clearer picture",1532822400,,90,4.625
8680976,5,B00NXLLYQ2,Given as a gift to someone.  Very well recoded and transferred concert.  A good concert  ( multi night ) form the early seventies for any RS collector.,1530489600,,151,4.518518518518518
8680977,3,B00NXLLYQ2,"The main problem is that because the Stones were being buffeted by too many currents at this time, glam, funk, country, etc.they lost their identity for a bit. The songs are good and well-performed, but the placement is bizarre, e.g. Gimme Shelter followed by Ain't Too Proud to Beg.  Great songs, good performances, but they don't belong together.

As for the production quality, the video sucks.

If you're a hardcore Stones fan go for it.  If not, leave it.",1527120000,,460,4.784810126582278

8680982,5,B00NXLLYQ2,"First off this is Ronnies first tour with The Stones.  He was still in The Faces at the time splitting duties between both groups until The Faces tour ended and he officially joined The Stones. Even though Mick Taylors days with the band were over, and his era with The Stones ('69-'74) was their best era in my opinion, Ron Wood was born to be a Rolling Stone and his playing here is excellent, as was the rest of the band. The playing was great, the sound was great, and the video was great. The only flaw (and it's a small one) is Mick Jagger seems to be over singing and yelling instead of just singing, through a lot of the show. Probably because it's the first show and he's loaded with energy and exited about the tour etc. Still it's a killer show of The still young Rolling Stones starting the 2nd decade of their long career. Get this NOW and play it loud..",1504483200,,867,4.254545454545455
8680983,5,B00NXLLYQ2,"I was there in 75 but at the Garden. What I didn't know was what instrument Wyman plays on for ""Fingerprint File"" or if Jagger played guitar on one song. It was incredible the lotus shaped stage, the stage antics by Billy Preston on Piano (and all for $12.50 kids!) whew!!!!!",1497830400,,275,4.411764705882353
