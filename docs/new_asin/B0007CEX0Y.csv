2208016,5,B0007CEX0Y,I found this video to be extremely helpful with my friends recent pregnancy. I assisted in her birth and she repeatedly said how the positions and techniques she learned on this video helped her tremendously in the natural child-birth experience. We both found the format user friendly and felt the nurturing and preparation was fabulous. I highly recommend this video to anyone and everyone who has teh slightest interest in Yoga and participating in child birth. This Rocki video rocks.,1114387200,6,488,5.1125
2208017,5,B0007CEX0Y,I'm using this workout for my 3rd baby and wished I'd had it for the first 2. I always feel better after doing it. The teacher is good and I can do the positions even though I've only ever takena  couple of yoga classes (before I got pregnant this time). I try to do it in the morning and I feel good all day.,1114387200,7,309,3.828125
2208018,5,B0007CEX0Y,"This combo workout, relaxation and meditation is a great way to tune into your new baby without the chanting, incense-burning stuff that I don't like about some yoga classes.  The workout is easy to follow and gentle and after it's done I feel energized and calm.  Rocki's a wonderful teacher and goes through each pose slowly enough to be able to follow easily. The women are real-looking pregnant women - not stick-figure models, which is much better to look at when you're pregnant. I loved the section when you focus on your baby. Talk about early bonding! I highly recommend this. Next I'm trying Rocki's Labor Prep.",1113955200,9,621,4.794392523364486
2208083,4,B0007CEX0Y,"This video gives a good workout, but the problem is it is a bit fast paced so this makes it a bit to follow in the beginning.  However, once you get used to it, it is a good workout video.  The next two videos are a bit slower paced, but their content is two short.  I think all three videos should be placed on one DVD.  In this video, there is a decent focus on kagels , so that is a definite plus.  These are the thoughts of my wife by the way, as well, I don't see this video helping the ""coach"" very much :)",1143244800,2,512,3.792452830188679
2208084,2,B0007CEX0Y,"Like other reviewers, I found this DVD to be dull but mostly, I felt Rocki did not explain the modifications for the poses very well. I'm 8 1/2 months pregnant and my life is all about modifications these days!

The program opens with the actresses all finishing up their squats, so I suppose you're supposed to do these (Rocki suggests you do 10, 20 or 30) on your own before pressing ""play."" The next pose is a sitting pose that is very uncomfortable and cuts off circulation to the legs (and, rather than relaxing, I sit and worry about varicose veins.)

My biggest complaint is the series of pilates moves to strengthen the hips and buttocks, which is right in the middle of the program. I benefit tremendously from the hip loosening aspects of yoga in the first half of the program, only to flex and tighten my hips up again 5 minutes later. It feels counter productive.

If you're thinking about this DVD, I'd suggest checking it out from the library first. I'm glad I did.",1142467200,6,979,4.519774011299435
2208085,1,B0007CEX0Y,"This was the most boring yoga workout that I have ever seen.  If it's not bad enough that you're tired from being pregnant, this DVD puts you to sleep.  I understand that yoga is supposed to relax a person, but this is severe boredom.  The poses are not being held long enough to receive the benefits of the stretch and the routine itself is long and drawn out.",1141862400,2,361,4.279411764705882
2208086,5,B0007CEX0Y,This yoga workout is awesome!! I would recommend it to all my pregnant friends. I've tried other pregnancy yoga tapes and this is my absolute fave! My husband even does it with me (and enjoys it). The DVD is very relaxing but you also get a good workout. I especially love the end when you meditate with your baby!! EXCELLENT!!!,1129075200,5,328,4.483333333333333
2208087,5,B0007CEX0Y,This DVD is great.  It's relaxing yet you feel like you are getting a good work out.  She's also very good at explaining what she's doing so you can follow the moves without always looking at the tv.,1128470400,3,199,4.2105263157894735
2208088,5,B0007CEX0Y,"Rocki is a terrific instructor and I love the way I feel after doing this workout. She gives different positions for different abilities-I'm still doing the beginning stuff, but hopefully by the time the baby is born-I'll be doing the more challenging stuff. I love the focus on the baby and the focus on listening to your body and how your body feels. Rocki stresses that you should listen to your body-unlike to many other tapes that just want you to sweat it out-Thank you Rocki--I'm so happy I found this DVD.",1126742400,3,513,4.586956521739131
2208089,5,B0007CEX0Y,I had attended prenatal classes with Rocki and was so excited to findout I could continue with her on DVD. She is so experienced and gives an earthy feel to her moves and stretches as well as the wonderful meditation with the baby at the end. Every woman should get to experience Rocki on video if they can't in person!,1126569600,,319,4.333333333333333
2208090,5,B0007CEX0Y,"This DVD has been a godsend for me. I have been doing The Method prenatal yoga tape since my first trimester, and recently added this to my lineup. After just one workout with Rocki, I felt like a new person, not like a six-months-pregnant lady! Even my husband noticed my improved mood and appearance (I was probably standing unslouched because I felt better!) While this DVD isn't for those who have no exposure to yoga, it is so good that it would be worth taking the time to learn (either by getting a book to learn the yoga terms/positions first, or by watching the tape several times through before attempting the moves.)",1126569600,9,627,4.607142857142857
2208091,5,B0007CEX0Y,"I am planning on getting pregnant with my second child soon.  Since I want to make sure to keep exercising while I'm pregnant again and heard yoga is not so hard on the joints, I thought I'd try this. I've never done yoga before, but Rocki is really good at explaining the poses. I think her voice is calming, too, which is helpful to concentrate on the moves and your breath. The first time I did this...I couldn't make it all the way through 'cause I was too tired out. But with a few more viewings I got the exercises down pat. So when I become pregnant again...I'll really know the workout well. I'm going to buy this DVD for my girlfriend who just found out she is pregnant.",1126569600,,679,4.263565891472868
2208092,2,B0007CEX0Y,"I gave this DVD two stars when I started using it. Since I bought it I decided to give it a try after 5 or 6 times of doing it, After couple times, I began to enjoy it, I feel that I'm working out my legs, but, arms, etc. without hurting or exhausting myself.  I think the poses have helped strenghten my legs and will see the benefit during labor. I would recommend this DVD if you want a workout without the sweat.",1126569600,2,416,4.0120481927710845
2208163,2,B0007CEX0Y,"the reviews seem to be written by students of Rocki, and not video exercisers. Rocki is was too serious and doesn't inpsire you to stick with it, even some of the more difficult moves. The setting is ok, but al in all I found Leisa Hart's FITMAMA dvd to be way better, easier to do and the results I got from it were excellent, so I do not recommend this dvd(which i sold at ebay!).",1126483200,,382,4.1066666666666665
2208164,5,B0007CEX0Y,"This DVD is great! I'm so glad I found it. Every time I use it it makes me feel better.  The stretches are nice and slow, the poses are a challenge but not so difficult I can't do them and it feels like this instructor really knows what she's talking about. I like the different options she gives, depending on what you're capable of doing. It feels like a work-out, but also makes me feel energized (how is that possible?). I love the meditation on the baby at the end, too.",1124323200,3,475,4.21978021978022
2208165,5,B0007CEX0Y,"I really enjoy Rocki's Prenatal Yoga video. Although Rocki is a bit serious, the moves are explained extremely well with suggestions for variations for your body and comfort level.

The room is full of an eclectic mix of women with different body shapes and of different ethnicities. One of them is always doing one of the variations, so you never feel like you're a loser who can't keep up with the ""real"" yogis.

There is hardly any of the meditation that can accompany certain kinds of yoga practices, which actually works better for me. And you stretch, strengthen and tone every part of your body.

All in all, it's one of my preferred prenatal yoga tapes.",1124323200,6,661,4.681034482758621
2208166,5,B0007CEX0Y,"Finally, a prenatal yoga video I can recommend to my students! This video is safe and energizing and respectful of the pregnant woman's body and baby. The expectant mother is in good hands and company with Rocki's solid and soothing instruction guiding them through their pregnancy. This is a video that makes the prenatal body feel good. Well done!",1124236800,2,349,4.932203389830509
2208167,5,B0007CEX0Y,"I am lucky enough to live in L.A. so I went to Rocki's classes religiously when I was pregnant with my first baby and I credit the yoga with my easy labor & delivery, as well as feeling great during my pregnancy. Now that I have a toddler and am expecting baby #2, it is hard for me to get away for classes but the video is a great substitute (and much cheaper!)",1124236800,4,362,3.9726027397260273
2208168,5,B0007CEX0Y,"I had just started taking yoga classes when I found out I was pregnant. After a month or two, I found that ""normal"" yoga classes were not comfortable anymore, and I could not find a good prenatal yoga class. I tried this tape and love it. Rocki's routine is just challenging enough for me, but she gives suggestions on almost every pose on how to make it more or less challenging. It truly is a routine for every level. And for every stage--I am now in my sixth month, but the girls in the video are about ready to pop! She does a lot of Kegels, and a little bit of calisthenics, and every exercise & pose is great for easing symptoms of pregnancy or for getting ready for labor. It has SO helped with my lower back pain. I really appreciate the short meditations that she does at the start & end of her routine also.",1124236800,2,817,4.210191082802548
2208169,5,B0007CEX0Y,"I love this workout! I've been doing it since my first trimester and I always feel better the days I work out with it. The breathing makes me feel good & I especially love the meditation at the end. The teacher explains the poses well and even offers different ways to do them, depending on how far along you are. I don't know what I'd do without it!",1124150400,2,350,4.161764705882353
2208170,3,B0007CEX0Y,"i really wasn't sure which dvd to order. after ordering the Rocki dvd and viewing it just once, i wish i made a different purchase. the yoga postions are good and helpful but Rocki doesn't really smile and i didn't really feel like she was pleasing to look at. so, overall, it's ok, but i think, i would prefer something else.",1122336000,,326,4.360655737704918
2208171,5,B0007CEX0Y,"This DVD is exactly what I was looking for. I have no interest in taking a yoga class, however, I did need some direction as far as stretching and trying to be more comfortable in general, and this does the trick. I love that she just gets down to business without the fluff. I definetly reccomend this for people who are new to yoga, I will buy  the next two in the series as my preganancy progresses.",1119398400,4,402,4.220779220779221
2208172,5,B0007CEX0Y,"This was an amazing DVD. I found just what I wanted in a yoga workout with added responsibility of pregnancy-gentleness and kindness to my own changing body and to my baby. I appreciated Rocki's emphasis on listening to your body so that you feel great pregnant, not limited by it. I feel energized and peaceful after the workout. Rocki exudes a confidence and reassurance which comes through tot he participant. I really recommend this video. It's fun, too!",1114387200,6,458,4.884615384615385
8046606,5,B0007CEX0Y,Rocki tremendously helped me during my first pregnancy and resurrected me during my second. HIGHLY recommended to ALL pregnant women.,1408838400,,133,5.7
8046607,5,B0007CEX0Y,"This is a great workout one of the best ""workout"" style yoga DVDs I have done. I love the length of it as well, most seem far to short.",1319760000,,135,3.689655172413793
8046608,1,B0007CEX0Y,"This review does not have anything to do with the content of the DVD but rather, my shopping experience in purchasing said DVD.  As of 09/08/11, in Amazon's product description page, it is indicated that this DVD, along with Vol 2 and 3, has closed captioning for the deaf and hard of hearing.  Upon receiving this DVD, I found out that the DVD offered no captioning OR subtitle features.  I spoke with Amazon and suggested that they remove the captioning claim so future customers with hearing loss won't make the same mistake; the response I received was that my suggestion would be taken into consideration at this time.  If you are purchasing this DVD and want to use its captioning feature, please know it isn't available on these DVDs (Vols. 1-3).",1315440000,2,753,4.7251908396946565
8046609,4,B0007CEX0Y,"Good relaxing dvd. I felt like I got a lot out of it, I enjoyed that they put the kegels in there, which forces me to do them! This is not a challenging workout for someone of average fitness. It left me feeling great. I would recommend it.",1285459200,,240,4.020833333333333
8046610,5,B0007CEX0Y,"I've never written a review for Amazon before, but for this I needed to.  I've seen the reviews on the sets and the poses.  Is it the most exciting video ever...no.  But it worked for me.  I tried to stay active in general throughout my pregnancy, and this is the workout that I did most often.  I made modifications as needed. I got carpal tunnel and couldn't put pressure on my wrists. My ankles swelled so I took it easy on my legs.  I went into labor 20 days early with my first baby at the age of 41 and was in labor for 8 hours.  TOTAL. Water breaking at midnight till birth at 8 a.m. with no epidural.  I don't know for sure how much was the video, but if I have another baby, you better believe I'll be doing this again.",1275177600,,728,4.041958041958042
8046611,2,B0007CEX0Y,"This DVD does not visit traditional yoga poses as I had expected. There are a lot of breathing exercises and floor exercises, such as leg lifts. This DVD also tends to be bland in terms of set and color.",1261008000,,203,4.230769230769231
8046612,5,B0007CEX0Y,"I love this tape.  I think Rocki does a great job of selecting poses that stretch & strengthen in all the right places.  She doesn't over-explain, so you can really use it again and again without getting annoyed.  It also dovetails very nicely into birthing positions.  I plan to get this DVD for all my friends who find out they're pregnant - I was surprised at some of the unfavorable reviews, but I guess different bodies need different things.  I practice yoga and am a dancer and this was perfect for me.",1207440000,,509,4.489130434782608
8046613,4,B0007CEX0Y,"I purchased 3 pre natal yoga dvds and this one is my favorite. Rocki is a great instructor. I would not suggest this for someone who has never done Yoga before, but for intermediates it is a must have!",1178668800,2,201,4.17948717948718
8046614,4,B0007CEX0Y,She has a weird voice. If you can get over her gnarly asthetic then this DVD is great. The poses weren't too strenuous and she didn't try to push you too hard. I liked that the women actually looked pregnant as some other DVD's find stick thin pregnant women who make you feel bloated. It was a good time worth the money!,1154476800,4,321,4.193548387096774
8046615,5,B0007CEX0Y,"This video has been a lifesaver for me, both mentally and physically.  It's not flashy or gimmicky and the instructor isn't a celebrity (that I know of) but the workout is very solid. I think that's one of the things I like best about it - it's substance not just show. It seems like Rocki really knows what she's doing because I always feel so good after doing the video. She offers different ways to do the poses, which is great on days that I don't feel my best. (I imagine that will be handy later in my pregnancy, too, when I approach the size of a whale.) I highly recommend it for any preggo who wants to feel good.",1143676800,3,622,4.183333333333334
