2549851,4,B000F2CADS,"Sherlock Holmes, Columbo, Hercule Poirot -- genius detectives are usually a bit quirky. But no other is as quirky as Adrian Monk, the obsessive-compulsive detective.

""Monk: The Obsessive Compulsive Collection"" compiles the first four seasons of this funny, likable little mystery series. Tony Shalhoub shines as everyone's favorite obsessive-compulsive detective, solving the case with his gift/curse and his willingness to go anywhere... that doesn't have germs.

Adrian Monk's wife Trudy was killed in a car-bombing, and the devastated detective fell apart completely. Years later, Monk (Tony Shalhoub) is partially recovered, but he still is obsessive-compulsive and has dozens of phobias. The only way he manages is with his assistant Sharona (Bitty Schram) -- and later her successor Natalie (Traylor Howard) -- babysitting him.

When a politician is nearly killed in a mystery shooting, the police are baffled. So Captain Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine) reluctantly calls in his old pal to solve the case. From then on, Monk is called in for dozens of bizarre, baffling cases. His excellent memory and his OCD (""It's a gift.... and a curse"") allow him to see patterns and details where other people see nothing.

Among Monk's cases are going undercover at a prison, a killer dentist, a deadly Christmas gift, an elephant used as a lethal weapon, a billionaire mugger, saving Willie Nelson from a murder rap, trapping a black widow, the death of a 115-year-old man, the Mafia, martial-artists, murdered models, and a guy who leaped out of a plane -- and died by drowning.

But as quirky and bizarre as the cases is, it never stops hitting the heartstrings. Monk is still passionately devoted to his dead wife; in the whole series, he goes on two dates (both disastrous). He also becomes attached to a little boy and even tries to adopt him, and it's a credit to this show's writers that the ending of that episode isn't maudlin or sappy.

""Monk"" is the sort of show that usually gets cancelled after five episodes -- it's well-written, amusing, and smart. So by TV standards, lasting four seasons is nothing short of miraculous. Like any long-running show it has its duds (""Mr. Monk Takes His Medicine"" always makes me cringe), but the overall series shows no signs of decline in all four seasons.

There are gunfights and SWAT teams, like on any cop show, but the main focus here is on detecting. And the writers are skilled at coming up with all sorts of bizarre or unsolvable crimes, which only Monk could unravel. Not to mention the dialogue, which leans heavily on dry humour (""There's an old saying: 'Don't change anything, ever."" ""That's an old saying?"" ""I've been saying it for years..."")

But the series wouldn't be what it is without Tony Shalhoub. He played weird roles in movies like MIB and ""Galaxy Quest,"" and so he knows how to balance out Monk's weirdness and genius without leaning too heavily on either. When told to sit on the ground, he says nervously, ""I can't. Animals do things on the ground. Terrible, terrible things.""

Schram and Howard are both good as his assistants, and they're similar without being TOO alike -- one was a hardened New York gal, and the other is a rebel rich girl with a checkered employment past. And Levine and Jason Gray-Stanford round off the cast as genial cop Stottlemeyer and his earnest (if slightly goofy) sidekick Disher.

""Monk: The Obsessive-Compulsive Collection"" shows us all of this excellent show (so far), with its uniquely appealing hero. It's a gift... and a curse.",1150848000,58,3531,4.959390862944162

2549856,4,B000F2CADS,"The golden globe winning series is satisfying for the fans of crime dramas

and also the fans of comedy it's a great combination of thrill and comedy

tony shalhoob the emmy award winning actor is just brilliant .

he is able to convince  us that he is the  Obsessive Compulsive detective,

with great preformance by tony shalhoob and his supporitng cast you can sence the attraction between them which makes watching the episode even more enjoyable .

in my point of view This is one of the best shows on TV. I say that because it shares one common trait with every show I have ever loved: Heart. Behind the ominous tinge of death, the cynical barkings of Captain Stottlemeyer, the Barney Fife-esque antics of Randy Disher, the equal parts maternal nagging and New Jersey attitude of Charona Flemming and the fact that it's basically a show about poking fun at one guy's mental problems is love. We LOVE Adrien Monk. We join him in mourning his wife's death, and we live and die with each step he takes toward being reinstated.

This is more than a cop show. This is more than a detective show. This is more than a comedy. This is more than a drama. Given the slightest amount of cosmic justice, this show will go down in history alongside ""Sports Night,"" ""Freaks and Geeks,"" and ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" (I apologize for nothing) as a show that did not give in to the horrors of professional television, but rose above them to produce pure art.

this a great show I really recommend it

2549865,1,B000F2CADS,"I'm not going to waste too much time on this review,as hollywood will always make a quick buck off of anyone or anything. Also people who have never walked a mile in another person's shoes will never see the darker side to what other's brush off,or find ""entertaining""

 I've had obsessive compulsive disorder since the age of 13. With medicine,O.C.D is tolerable,without it;it's just as disabiling as cancer. I

had an uncle who also had this disease;a more severe case than mine. He committed suicide.

 Since O.C.D is a fairly new diagnosed disease (a little over ten years  now) many older people who had the disease in the past never got any treatment or help,as it was unknown. Since O.C.D can be hereditary (my father also has obsessive compulsive),I live with him and watch him continue to decline. After 30 to 50 years with no treatment;there is no hope for that person. The disorder takes over the person's mind completely and they are trapped in an endless cycle of rituals. All I can do is stay with my father and comfort him as best I can in a house he never leaves.

 Monk not only takes O.C.D light-heartedly and jokes about it,it also misinforms the public. Here are a few grains of truth for people who don't really know much of anything about O.C.D other than what they see on Monk.

 1. Not all O.C.D sufferes are terrified of germs.

 2. Neurosis and obsessive compulsive disorder are two seperate things. A person who is neurotic isn't necessarily obsessive compulsive and vice versa.

 3. Much of Monk's personality is tied to O.C.P or obsessive compulsive personality,not disorder.

 If you really want to understand O.C.D and not give money to an insensitive and ignorant misconception;read the book,""The Broken Brain"" by Nancy C. Andreasen M.D,PhD.",1179964800,4,1773,4.821192052980132

2549868,5,B000F2CADS,"Adrian Monk (Tony Shalhoub) is a former San Francisco police detective.  He's suffered from obsessive-compulsive disorder and multiple phobias his entire life.  However, after the murder of his wife, he got so bad he couldn't face the world.  That's when Sharona (Bitty Schram) entered his life.  She's a nurse who helps him deal with the world around him.  With her help, he begins to face the world again.  Since being a detective is all he knows, he assists his former partner Captain Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine) and Lt. Disher (Jason Gray-Stanford) solve their most puzzling crimes.

And they regularly seem to have some pretty puzzling cases.  Why was a millionaire shot while mugging someone?  How did an 800-pound man commit murder?  How did a man send a letter bomb while in a coma?  Why are the members of a jury being killed?  Is a martial arts star alive or dead?  Did a monkey commit murder?  Who killed the pizza delivery guy?  How did an astronaut commit murder from space?

And did I mention this show is a comedy?  Along with a great puzzle, you also get plenty of laughs.  Each week, Monk must deal with some quirk in order to solve the case.  Maybe it's the little things, like straightening a stack of papers while fleeing a burning building, or something bigger like chasing a criminal through the sewer.

But there is a balance to the show.  While we might be laughing at Monk in one scene, we're sympathizing with him the next.  This is a real person, brought to life expertly by three-time Emmy winner Tony Shalhoub.  And he's deserved all three wins for this role.  He's supported by the rest of the cast, who also shine every week.

Along the way, Sharona left, to be replaced by Natalie (Traylor Howard).  While some have never warmed to her, I find I love her just as much if not more then Sharona.

So what do you get with this set?  59 hour long episodes and the two-hour pilot.  The set has a few extras, but at only five minutes each, they hardly go in depth.  But the shows themselves are well worth buying the set for.

The price can fluctuate.  Sometimes, this is a better deal then buying the sets individually, sometimes not.  Since you don't get anything special by buying the sets together, be sure you check that out.

Either way, be sure to check out this show.  It's the most fun you'll have watching murder on TV today.",1163548800,27,2359,4.548926014319809
2549869,5,B000F2CADS,"My 13 year old son has asbergers syndrome and really relates to Monk as a character. Monk is much more obsessive than our son but we all got laughs out of the ""food can't touch on the plate"" and ""I don't have issues with change. I just don't want to be there when it happens.."" kind of comments. They certainly hit home and due to the fact that Monk was able to verbalize some of these issues, we were all able to laugh about them and then talk about it afterwards. Great show. Very funny. Also, we believe the message that Monk can be successful as a human and a working professional even with all his OCD issues gives hopes to those who might exhibit some of these traits that there is life even with difficulties.",1163289600,8,716,4.272058823529412

Their look of gob-smacked amazement when they are caught without an acceptable explanation of why they did what they did is always so satisfying.  The good guy shows up the bad guy.

Hilarious and touching and entertaining mystery fare. These writers had it going on when they wrote this show - the character of Monk is like ""everyman"" - he represents in hyperbole the fears and insecurities that are the human condition. But the reason i LOVE this show is that it is not just a laughable picture of neurosis - every episode is a hopeful story of prevailing in spite of our weaknesses (not prevailing over weakness...because his weaknesses remain.) but prevailing in spite of them because he always wins anyway. In spite of himself. It's an awesome message. A very positive show in that way -  a huge message of underdog hope. It's one of the most refreshing and entertaining shows that this era of TV has produced. I WISH these writers would put together another show. I don't think they could fail!
