7837199,5,6303091652,One of the best Laurel and Hardy movies - I can't stop laughing with I think of Stan as Oliver's wife mincing around in her wrap and making faces at Oliver as Stan's wife. It is too much. I am aching with laughter.,1519344000,,214,4.0

7837202,5,6303091652,"I don't get why a lot of fans and critics feel this is one of their worst or weakest shorts.  I've always loved it; it might be in my personal Top 10 or Top 15.  Stan and Ollie are celebrating their mutual anniversary and congratulating one another on what a great move it was to marry into one another's families.  They have married one another's sisters (themselves in drag), and of course these women look just like their brothers, only they're women.  They also have all of the annoying and bothersome characteristics of their brothers, and this soon leads to a lot of sniping, bickering, and fighting between all four of them.  We know that nothing ever goes right in their world, and that if something can go wrong, it absolutely will, in the worst possible way.  That is heartily evident here; indeed, by the end of the short, it seems as though divorce is imminent, not to mention the end of the friendship between Stan and Ollie!  My own personal favorite part is when Stan goes down to the store to get ice-cream for the party, but they're all out of the flavor he was asked to get.  He calls home to report this, and the next choice he's asked to get is also all sold out.  He calls home yet a third time, and lo and behold, that flavor isn't in stock either!  Stan comes home empty-handed, saying that he doesn't have the money with him because ""I spent it all calling you.""  It might not be as classic or gag-filled as some of their other shorts, but there's incredible chemistry and timing here, as well as the unique scenario.",1137542400,2,1541,4.429078014184397
7837203,5,6303091652,"Some critics have decried 'Twice Two', or rated it less highly than other L&H comedies. For me, this one is a marvel of the ingenuity (and utter shamelessness, in the cause of comedy!) for which L&H are known and loved. Watch as they portray themselves AND their own sisters/wives. Try #1: to find it unfunny; #2: to formulate any possible criticism. The brewing cattiness between the women is so eloquent.. so true to life.. it nearly has one believing they really ARE their wives. Laurel and Hardy weren't perfect. But how much closer can you get than this?",1080518400,2,559,4.714285714285714
