7739311,4,B01EP1NZWY,"The anime is good and worth the watch. But I would recommend the subbed version the cast has more emotion and enthusiasm, the Dub cast is ok it's watchable not the best in the world but like I said worth the watch.",1472515200,2,214,4.119047619047619
7739312,4,B01EP1NZWY,"One day, completely without warning, the 5 members of the literature club all discover they have superpowers. 6 months later nothing dramatic has happened, no villains have appeared, and they have gotten so used to their powers that it has simply become a part of their everyday life. ll they ever figure out the purpose of their powers?

This series was lots of fun, but be warned - it was based on a light novel series and kind of ends right before it starts explaining what is really going on (I think the last or second to the last episode is the first place they even hint that there is something behind the kids sudden acquisition of superpowers).
I think it is still plenty entertaining and worth watching. I felt a little annoyed by the ending, but also somewhat satisfied with the cutoff point. The superpowers the kids get are very powerful and it was pretty amusing to see how they tried to utilize them in their normal lives without doing too much damage.

The series is 12 episodes long and it seems unlikely there will ever be a second season. I watched it on Crunchyroll, where it is still available at the time this review was posted.",1467763200,4,1150,4.524038461538462
8759347,3,B01EP1NZWY,"I would have expected better, but it seems that some anime is written to earn disapproval more than approval.  The main character never really makes sense, numerous incidents that should serve a purpose to expand a character badly misfire, and sometimes the attempts to make the story grow turn into something akin to weeding a garden in a pouring rain.  Yes, you can do it, yes, it makes pulling the weeds easier, but come on, the sloshing through the garden is less than entertaining.  That was what this series did, too.  It was effective in showing us the story, but because it was so structured, returned so many times to do something that was trivial in a way that made it more trivial that it began to detract from what might have been a much better story on paper.

On the screen it was introduce chop introduce chop, take a half a breath, hold it, then change the topic and hope the stylized chopping was going to be enough.  Somewhat harem structured, it managed to get the harem structure in the way of telling the story.

I gave it a three because a rating of two and a half was not available.  It does not deserve to be kicked down to a two, but it really doesn't earn a full three, either.",1536278400,,1203,4.387387387387387

8759351,1,B01EP1NZWY,"I have people over for anime watching session frequently. It kind of gets loud with 6-10 people. Some people want to watch, some talk. Subtitles just allow backup for when it's to loud to hear. I'm tired of spending this much to be limited for no reason other than they don't want us to see difference in spoken vs original language.",1483142400,,333,4.475409836065574

8759356,5,B01EP1NZWY,"This is a conditional five star. It's a good story with great characters and I really enjoyed it and recommend watching it. But there are still some big plot holes and unresolved questions. If this is a first season then I'm all for the five stars but if it isn't then I'd give it a four at best. Also, if unresolved issues bother you I can't recommend it as I'm pretty certain they will bug you in this series. As for me, I'm waiting for season 2:)",1474675200,,449,4.172413793103448
