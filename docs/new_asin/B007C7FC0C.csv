8514280,3,B007C7FC0C,"Both Strauss and Lehar wrote romantic costume operas about Transylvania,(today northern Romania, then south Hungary), which, in their day, were considered these great composers' masterpieces. Neither hailed from the region. Lehar was born in a Hungarian speaking district of Slovakia and Strauss in German speaking Vienna! Neither masterpiece is familiar to today's English speaking audiences. Strauss' GYPSY BARON remains popular in Europe, in a major rewrite as an operetta, performed with about one hour of music cut. Lehar's ZIGEUNERLIEBE is a psychological study of the wedding jitters of the daughter of a wealthy Boyar, which could easily play today in English speaking countries as a ""Broadway musical"" because its dialogue to music ration is quite suitable for a ""musical"". The film is, in its way, extremely professional but films only about two thirds of the opera. The dream sequences are done superbly as an art film. The whole product is a beautiful travelogue of old Transylvania. The English subtitles, especially of the psychological references, are excellent It is a wonderful way to enjoy this acknowledged masterpiece, which could probably do well on Broadway or in London's West End today under the right booking. The problem for opera and operetta goers is that it is not filmed with them in mind. The one superduperstar in the cast is the great Adolf Dallapozza who, like everyone else, is first recorded in a sound studio and then dubs the soundtrack when filmed outdoors, sometimes in long panning shots, a 1970's technique no longer acceptable for filming stage works. Dallapozza is, of course the ideal male lead Joszi, yet is cast here in the shorter, supporting lyric role of the rich and faithful young Boyar Jonel, whose incredible star power comes through in his few scenes. To summarize the brilliant storyboard, Zorika is about to marry rich and faithful Jonel of her own upper class. Her wedding jitters lead her to fancy Joszi,a gypsy alpha male, and, through her dream projections, to have nightmares about her father's relationship with a flashy floozy and her sister's relationship with a respectable young bloke not of their upper class. The nightmares are art filmed with fascinating technique, but do not necessarily bring out the glory of the music or, in any way, suggest the dazzling charisma of live performance. The running time is cut to about an hour and a half.",1335744000,16,2411,5.121827411167513
