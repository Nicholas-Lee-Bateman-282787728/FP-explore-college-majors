The core story and sub stories were very interesting with a strong cast,fast pace and kept us wondering and guessing ..what's next . Enjoyed  the Parisian scenes.",1437609600,,339,4.844827586206897
4254968,5,B0043CCIII,"Fabulous show. Everyone is self-interested, screwed-up, greedy, cannot do the right thing, or is just a murderous villain.. The French legal system is even worse than ours. The gorgeous female lawyer, Audrey Fleurot, is cunning and shifty.  Great characters and incredible situations. Everyone just falls deeper and deeper into a pit.  Every show is a cliff hanger. No wonder this show was a hit in Europe.",1402876800,3,406,5.136363636363637

4254971,5,B0043CCIII,"Gritty, realistic, superb characterizations, good action, and an interesting contrast to how things operate under the Napoleonic code in France as compared to the English common law that governs the United Kingdom and the USA.",1386028800,3,226,5.485714285714286
4254972,4,B0043CCIII,"My sister sent me the DVD of season one, which I loved, so I bought season two. I find the series well acted and the story line interesting. Its a bit bloody and violent, but that is okay. Also all of the characters are either bent or have serious flaws, which makes them interesting. Hopefully the rest of Spiral will become available in US DVD format soon.",1385856000,4,358,4.358208955223881
4254973,5,B0043CCIII,"As a lover of good cop shows my viewing as been a little flat since the ending of The Wire and The Shield. Fear not however the second series of the French TV cop show Spiral has filled the void nicely. Whilst not up to the standard of the Wire, but then what is? Spiral 2 is as good if not better that the Shield and way ahead of both Law and Order and CSI (Yawn)and better that Spiral 1.

As an Anglo/Saxon I am not sure I always understood the workings of the French legal system and the relationship between the police and the examining magistrates, who are confusingly called judges but are more like an American DAs. However I cannot say that this stopped my enjoyment of this excelent series. In a nutshell a group of French police investigate the burning alive of a drug dealer in a poor Parisien suburb and this leads them to uncover a large drug ring. Throw a couple of corrupt lawyers and we have an excelent example of the genre.
As an aside, do not expect French elegence. These flics must be the scruffest coppers on British, US or French TV.
Hope season 3 is a good.",1301616000,6,1081,4.273170731707317

8414570,5,B0043CCIII,"Spiral is a French police procedural, that goes beyond the nitty gritty. Much of the series takes place outside of the offices. But when we do go in the detectives offices are bleak and dirty. Even though the series is filmed in color, it is dark so it seems to be filmed in black and white. The first episode can be the one that makes or breaks the series. In the second series we come to get to know the characters involved. The detectives all have their own stories, and it seems these people all have secrets, and learning about them all brings us closer to the group. We also meet the lawyers, the judges and the official hierarchy of these professions.

Deputy Prosecutor Pierre Clement, played by Gregory Fitoussi, is the good looking prosecutor working his way up. The head police detective Laure Berthaud played by Caroline Proust, is very professional on duty, but in her private life, quite the opposite. One issue that drove me crazy through the four series I have seen is that Laure has no sense of herself, her hair is always a mess, even with it cut short, it is a mess, and she wears clothes right off the floor, and,she is looking for Love in most of the wrong places. The other two main detectives Tintin and Gilou, have such interesting lives you need to see them.

In the second series the main crime is the death of a young man from a burning car. Someone films this setting, and that comes integral to the show. Detective a Laure Berthaude is caught up in an attack, and while fighting off her attackers she uses an unlicensed baton. This is discovered and she is reprimanded and suspended. At the same time there is a large drug group under observation, and one of the po,ices Own is working undercover and gets into mucho trouble. There are other crimes, and we have a glimpse into the French criminal system and the corruption inherent. How these characters react to these situations is the stuff that makes this series so worthwhile.

8414577,5,B0043CCIII,"Although I haven't seen all of the 4 seasons, I have seen 1-3 and they are all very, very good.  Not only is it very realistic (and grim) but it shows the corruption in government as well.  Didn't I mention that it was realistic?  Anyway, the acting is superb but unless your French is great, you will have to watch to read the sub-titles.",1453680000,2,339,4.265625
