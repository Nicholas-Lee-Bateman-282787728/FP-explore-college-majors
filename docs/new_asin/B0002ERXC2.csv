2082024,5,B0002ERXC2,This is a great season and this is a really good series! It took HBO long enough to come out with the DVDs.,1090713600,,107,3.6956521739130435
2082025,5,B0002ERXC2,"In terms of fictional series, HBO is the only real reason to own a television set.
The Wire is the best of the HBO Original Series. And the most underappreciated. The only criticism one may have of The Wire is that it is too complicated. But in actuality, I think this is The Wire's best selling point. It's a rarity in television to find a series that compels the viewer to rise to the level of the writing instead of the typical lowering of the writing's quality to dumb it down to attract the most mass appeal to sell ad slots. That's the beauty of HBO - you've bought the service, so you get what you pay for or cancel your subscription. HBO is not targeting the unwashed masses to sell ads, it puts out quality television to attract subscribers. It's a beautiful system that I believe (you heard it here first) will someday become the norm in cable television (channel-by-channel subscription with no advertising).
HBO's format raises the quality and The Wire epitomizes the beauty of this system the most of all HBO Original Series. The plot is so complicated, so multi-layered that I keep watching over and over just to make sure I get it all. I feel that I am failing as a human being if I don't do The Wire justice and get the whole plot line straight. You can't criticize the Wire for being too complicated; it's quite refreshing to have a television show that challenges me as the viewer instead of spoon feeds me.
In 1961, FCC Chairman Newton R. Minow said that television was a ""Vaste Wasteland."" He was right. HBO wasn't founded until 1971 and The Wire didn't premier until 2002.",1089763200,7,1593,4.515570934256055
2082026,5,B0002ERXC2,"I think The Wire, both the first and second seasons, represents the best television ever has offered. The plot is so intricate and plays out as a puzzle of fascinating pieces. Acting, brilliant writing, a boatload of memorable characters and moments -- The Wire has it all. It can be a bit confusing at first and it is best to watch the first two episodes in one sitting. Try it, you'll love it.",1088208000,9,395,4.424657534246576
2082027,5,B0002ERXC2,"First and foremost, David Simon is a genius. Homicide: A year on the Killing Streets, The Corner, both amazing stories and shows. The acting is brillinat, with each side of the ""drug war"" having their own problems which shape perspectives.
Aside from the above rant, the show ranks as one of the best shows on TV currently, and will go down in history as a fantastic character study.",1087344000,5,383,4.647058823529412
2082028,5,B0002ERXC2,"I wanted to somehow incorporate the word renaissance into this review, and find a clever way to call ""television in the last 4 years or so"" a renaissance. For lack of creativity I'll take a personal stance for this.
I was never a regular television viewer. I always preferred the VHS and later the DVD over watching a television program. Seemed like such devotion to be there every week. But what was sparked by an interesting premise, 24 hours in the life of the counter terrorist agent, and each episode in real time, lured me in. I fell for 24, than I fell for the Shield when it premiered later a few months after 24 did. I am still thankful I saw ""The Shield"" advertisement on the corner of 39th and 9th Avenue.
I always saw posters for The Wire on the Path Train. Had no idea what it was all about. I was chalking it up to another spy type show that ABC would produce perhaps. I heard all the critical acclaim, still didn't bite. Than I saw that HBO On Demand was showing episodes 1 through 5. So I tuned in. Watched all 5 episodes in one day. Went back and put them on a blank tape. I'm glad I didn't have to long for HBO to put a new batch of episodes On Demand. They showed 6-10 next. And that's when it got so damn hard. Episode 10 ends in such a cliffhanger and (for those who have the On Demand channels) the next set of episodes wasn't set to be available for 4 weeks or so.
And thus my life for the beginning of this year was all about when the next batch of episodes would cycle through On Demand. I thought about savoring them too, when the middle of season 2 was shown I thought of watching one a week..it could never happen though.
I could have reviewed the show and talk about the characters and the plot that just keeps going, two seasons now, with season three on the way. But it's the experience that should be the selling point. For those who have seen the show know what I mean. It almost hurts to have to wait a whole week to see ""what happens next"". For those who have never seen the show feel happy that you can now see all of Season 1, at once.
24, The Shield, The Sopranos, Deadwood, and of course The Wire. It's a pretty fair arguement, or rather I can arguement my point well. Does television get any better than this?",1087257600,11,2249,4.184331797235023
2082029,5,B0002ERXC2,"I was living in Baltimore when this was being filmed and shown on HBO. I have driven through the streets of Baltimore, seen the docks and the Harbor up close and from a distance on the beltway, I have seen neighborhoods like the ones shown. This is a gritty no holds barred show with awesome characters and acting. It is written by a former Baltimore reporter, the characters based on actual drug kingpins. A former kingpin is an actor on the show who, ironically, plays a minister. Many Baltimore actors are used in the show. It is the best crime drama ever written and I highly recommend it to anyone. It starts a bit slow, but hooks you right into it. I live on the West Coast now. I do miss Baltimore, the accents, ""Lake Trout"", which isn't trout and isn't from a lake either, crabs, the O's, the Ravens etc. I have watched this series a few times over. I have never tired of it.",1518480000,2,883,4.325301204819277

2082031,5,B0002ERXC2,"The picture is 16:9 which I consider excellent for my television. The audio is 5.1 surround sound which I consider excellent for my sound system.

I like violence on my television It has shooting, punching, kicking and everything of all the action. This is just season one of many and I suppose I'll be watching all the rest.",1517616000,,430,4.3875
2082032,3,B0002ERXC2,"THE WIRE SEASON 1 ..... SEESAW inner city crime drama.  Some episodes are very good while others are only average.  Additionally there is an overuse of profanity and a constant pushing of gay agenda. ---  I've met and interacted with plenty of gang bangers / retired gang bangers as well as cops/retired cops and the depicted behaviour in this series is exagerated and at times completely phony. -- As there is no central character in the series it is more difficult to focus on certain characters and the characters don't stand out as much. --- Season 1 is OK but If u want to watch a worlds better series watch ""The Shield""  Seasons 1-7.  Season 1 starts off a little slower and then BAM it just kicks hard into high gear all the way through season 7. Hope this helps u out.",1517443200,,776,4.436619718309859

2082037,5,B0002ERXC2,"It's easy to see why this has been regarded as one of the best television series ever - including the very best ever, by some. However one needs to be patient and pay close attention, or much can be missed or not understood. In it's day one of the leading criticisms of the show was the over complicated plots and excessive number of main or, at least regular characters that a viewer had to follow. Those reasons likely contributing to it's only moderate run of five seasons.and generally less than stellar ratings. And even though it never won any major awards, most of the cast, as an ensemble was certainly considerably above average. The stories, though, were the real star(s). The Wire will unlikely ever be mentioned too often in the same breath as some of the other classics of it's era (like the Sopranos), but it probably deserves to be.",1515024000,,847,4.6158940397351

2082050,5,B0002ERXC2,"After one binge watches enough 'crime' series', ""The Wire"" comes as a bit of a revelation. This series has more 'reality' in one episode than an entire run of many of the series I've watched. How they were able to do this and how they got what appears to be massive co-operation to do this from many sources is a mystery to me but .... well, words, my words at least, do not, can not, begin to measure this series. It must be measured by the individual viewer and, like the people portrayed, it is what it is. That Royo, at least, did not get recognition for his role is beyond my understanding albeit there were many who stand out as actors here. And who could've guessed that that tall, skinny, hawk faced Reddick looked like that? It seems the more I like something, the fewer words I have to praise it other than to say that you ain't seen nuthin' yu ain't seen The Wire yo.",1506902400,2,878,4.263473053892215

WTF do you think happens in police work on a special detail made up of detectives from the homicide and NARCOTICS units? In B-MORE? C'mon, it was a cable show. If you want police lite, go find old episodes of CopRock somewhere. Maybe Moonlighting or at best, Miami Vice. Some of us appreciate amazing writing, gritty drama, and some of the most amazing acting in a police drama that I've ever seen. Idris Elba is a POWERHOUSE. Dominic West as McNulty is a wonderfully acted dichotomy of cop working hard yet with a not-so-perfect side. And you can't even question Michael K Williams as Omar Little. Damn, son. Poetry. One of the co-writers is a former Baltimore homicide detective. I'm pretty sure he has a good feel for how the city works. The creative staff is amazing. The show has slow points, but so does life and that kind of work, and the show isn't afraid to reflect that. Which makes it all the more realistic. If you can't appreciate it, move on. Your loss.

2082060,5,B0002ERXC2,"The Wire is a gritty and gripping detective drama, which is widely considered to be one of the all-time best shows in this genre, as well as being one of the greatest television programs ever made. It was created and primarily written by David Simon, the renowned author and former crime reporter, who, because of his background, was able to impart an uncanny sense of realism to the series. The Wire was set and produced in Baltimore, Maryland, and its story line centers around the organization and function of the criminal drug trade in Baltimore, and the tragic way in which it has ravaged the city, and its beleaguered residents. The Wire consists of a total of sixty episodes, spanning five seasons, with a different emphasis for each season. Although the multifaceted drug trade represents the overarching focus of this series, each individual season assesses the manner in which this criminal enterprise impacts a specific operational area of the city of Baltimore. The first season of The Wire"" examines the drug trade itself, the second season deals with the dysfunctional seaport system, the third season analyzes the corrupt city government and bureaucracy, the fourth season addresses the deteriorating school system, and the fifth and final season evaluates the unethical print news media. It brutally and realistically depicts the devastating effects that the criminal narcotic trade has had on the residents of inner city Baltimore, whose lives have been destroyed by the pervasive drug-related misery, despair, and hopelessness, which have now become endemic in this population. The Wire is characterized by insightful and brilliant writing, superb plot and character development, and absolutely spectacular acting performances, by its exceedingly talented ensemble cast. It definitely deserves the numerous awards and accolades which it has received over its five-year run. The Wire is a truly outstanding television series, which is riveting, moving, and emotional, and it merits an unequivocal five-star rating, along with a very strong recommendation.",1498953600,8,2072,5.41795665634675

Once you get past season 1, which is slow but very necessary to get you invested in the characters you will be following through 5 years of episodes, the stories seem to flow in an organic fashion.  There is action yes but there is also alot of moves that are made in one episode that will pay off in later episodes.  As the series is no longer broadcast, it does benefit from binge watching.  The characters suck you in both the good and the bad.

2082135,5,B0002ERXC2,"Free yourself from distractions, use headphones and binge.  This is fast street action presented through audio and acting, with coded messages,  nuanced conversations, facial micro-expressions and a studly score creating the drama.  With dozens of well cast characters and hundreds of moving parts, they get everything about the specific time, culture and technology where no artifice is required to keep you on the edge.  This is Baltimore before Martin O'Malley with racial tensions, drugs, guns and money, getting shaken by a moke named McNulty whose chief virtues are street smarts and stubbornness.  The cops and dealers are evenly matched man for man and the lines get blurred by personal relations and politics so you know the final score is going to be close, but teamwork beats top-down.

There are moral dilemmas and crises on both sides with players getting ground in the street chess (chess is also used as a potent metaphor).  Adjusting to a screenplay that constantly reaches for reality instead of entertainment takes time and concentration but is harder to stop than cocaine. This is easier to watch if you are used to black and white movies with subtitles.",1486339200,,1173,5.109947643979058

2082434,5,B0002ERXC2,"There is a good reason that The Wire is in the conversation for the best television series of all time.  It is politically astute, rich with fully developed characters, and very well plotted. As dark as it is with an underlying tone of hopelessness, there is enough wit and at least one unique character to root for.  Unlike shows such as The Sopranos and Breaking Bad, this show does not manipulate one into rooting for truly evil characters.  While there are sympathetic ""bad guys"" and despicable cops and public officials, this show has a strong moral core.  Each of the five seasons focuses on a different aspect of a major city (Baltimore), but characters carry over from season to season.  This first season focuses on how the drug enterprise leads to the deterioration of civil society both in terms of the dealers and their community as well as the law enforcement, legal, and political cultures. The drug enterprise pervades all five seasons, but is the entire focus of the first season.  This is an engrossing show that is in no way a ""guilty pleasure,"" it is television at its best.  Worth all of the accolades it has drawn.",1484092800,,1135,4.702020202020202

2082463,5,B0002ERXC2,"The Wire remains as good today as when it first aired. It is just as well written and acted as it was in 2002. Yes I was one of the few who watched it during its initial run.

The only difference is that at the time there was NOTHING else like it nor had there been previously. Today that is not true. Without The Wire modern long form storytelling as is common today might not have arrived for years. Shows like Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad have gotten people used to the idea that a TV show CAN tell a complete story with a beginning, middle and end but at the time The Wire aired the majority of TV shows only told one hour stories with very little character development. They were made so people could watch any episode from any season in any order without feeling lost, the show would reset every hour: Law and Order, CSIJAGNCIS (oh it's not the same show, sorry) didn't have character or story development.

Enter The Wire and a new era of television. Now days TV IS where we get longform storytelling, the movies are, for the most part, slam bang spectacle where this months superhero charges into the abyss. Don't get me wrong I love superhero movies but two hours is not enough time to tell a deep story. A whole season of Television spread out over multiple years that gives writers room to have character development.

Events from the first season resonate through all the way to the last episode. The wire is a masterpiece of writing acting directing peer storytelling in a visual form. This was a story that was meant to go for five seasons. The main character is the city of Baltimore the residents,  the cops, the criminals, the addicts, politicians, schools and let's not forget city Hall, the tell the city's story. There are no good and bad guys just a LOT of shades of gray.",1483920000,12,1797,4.4363636363636365

These episodes have intense moments and can be depressing re the drug scene. One can't help but sympathize with the desperation of these very young criminals at the mercy of their so-called ""mentors"" while at the same time recoiling at the behavior. The flaws in the bureaucracy, court system, police are there plus the virtues.  Manly scenes are not pleasant to watch, but it is reality-based. I get depressed at the futility of the drug scene, which is even worse today. I'm hooked and will continue to watch.",1483056000,,684,4.7

2082627,5,B0002ERXC2,"I never wanted to watch ""The Wire"" because of its title. That was a huge mistake. It is as good as ""The Shield"" or ""Breaking Bad"" combining superb acting with an intricate plot. It puts a new spin on police work between trying to do the right thing, and having to work around your fellow bad cops and political BS in Baltimore, Maryland. It will also make you thankful you did not grow up an inner city kid in that area. And some of the kids they have in this show are fantastic actors. I love to watch football but I have to admit ""The Wire"" has made me miss a few games.",1482796800,,572,4.070796460176991

2082648,5,B0002ERXC2,"Hard core and enlightening all in one.  I got turned on to this series by Adam Plantinga in his book 400 Things Cops Know (great book BTW).  This series uses the Baltimore PD as its backdrop for some very interesting, gritty stories.  Created by David Simon, author of ""Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets"" (1991), the series benefits from his 12 years working as a reporter for the Baltimore Sun's City Desk.

Is it relevant?  Well, if you're entertaining support for or joining BLM you should watch this series and perhaps read 400 Things Cops Know before making your move.  The world isn't always what it seems or what you may believe it or want it to be.",1482710400,7,662,4.5210084033613445

2082716,2,B0002ERXC2,"A waste of good acting and compelling cinematography.  Most people who rely heavily on profanity and expletive lack communication skills.  Faithfully copying such lamed and limited language into a script results in dialog that has the same shortcomings.  Only the most basic ideas can be expressed, and inefficiently at that.  No wonder these episodes drag.  Script writers really ought to study Shakespeare's plays.  All the characters in those plays, noble or evil, comic or tragic, ancient or young, mundane or magical, had lines to speak that revealed their natures and passions almost from their first words.  Shakespeare was the ultimate efficiency expert when it came to writing dialog, and every playwright since can learn from him.  For that matter, so can novelists, speech writers, and the folks who write commercials.  Especially that last bunch.",1482105600,,858,5.343283582089552

2082940,1,B0002ERXC2,"A slow-moving plot, a dialog liberally dependent on a torrent of common obscenities, a parade of mostly unlikable characters, all predisposed me to view this TV series negatively. On the plus side, it seemed that the depiction of the lower-class African-American subculture including its particular dialect was quite realistic--or, alternatively, that it was faithfully based on the broader society's biased expectations regarding this subculture, replete with two-dimensional stereotypes. Ultimately, this series left me cold because I have seen too many films and videos with a drug-dealer theme. This series, like many other portrayals of the drug subculture, end up indirectly, gradually, subliminally, to romanticize the life of the people--dealers and cops--who depend on it. 1 star.",1480291200,3,789,5.810344827586207

The complexity of development is not limited to the ""good guys"".  In fact, the thing that makes this series so great.is that.the bad guys are every bit as interesting as the police. But they are not one demensional and begins to see them as something other than criminals. Even when the bad guys are caught you feel some empathy with some of them. The law enforcement characters are equally complex and very much have issues with each others, not just the people they are chasing.  And then there is the political interaction between politicians and the police that highlights the divisions between those who are supposedly on the same side.

The politics involved and the egos and arrogance of the brass are, unfortunately, a reality.  I have watched everything but the last episode of season 1 and was left on the edge of my seat with episode 12.  Very worthy series and I am looking very forward to season 2.  One thing though, the argot of project's black culture can be a little hard to follow for those unfamiliar with it.",1475539200,,559,4.55

Their sentences rarely had a subject and a verb. Their sentences were never complete.  I do not choose to waste my time watching such garbage and I am sorry that you and a lot of people think this worthwhile.  Elevate your minds an f d

2083486,1,B0002ERXC2,"Garbage.  The trash language is quickly tiresome.  It seems to be a trend with HBO and Cinemax... to use every cuss word you can, (as many times as you can in a run on sentence) to butcher the English language.  It is not authentic, clever, or raw... it is low class. NO ONE talks like this. It serves no logical purpose except to push the stereotypes that are exploited in the writing.

Season 1 depicts a dark, gritty story about the drug trafficking in Baltimore and the police attempts to deal with it and build a case against one of the key drug dealers.  Also shows the negative effect of the culture of the police and government and how it interferes with enforcement of the law and solving the drug problem in the city.

Now, with the police murdering black citizens (Freddie Gray) throughout the country, the uprisings/resistance, and interviews with actors from The Wire I know this show is all too real.  To make this documentary of life in Baltimore, the person was a visionary and had to have guts.",1474675200,,448,4.792207792207792

This is the best way to watch (versus original TV airing) because if you are like me and do not choose to see the violent portions, you can just fast forward past that part. Plus they do more with the sound of the violence versus showing all the morbid details which is better for me.
Plus I hate it when they release season three of a show but you can't see season 1 &2. 99% of the time, I will not watch out of sequence. Here is season 1 so you get to see how it all started and how they grow as a team. Story line is well done and holds my interest episode to episode.

2083781,4,B0002ERXC2,"Not so gritty.  I had been avoiding this series because when it was on the air I had only caught half of the last season and the depictions were disturbing.  To clarify, I believed that the writers strayed too far off center and therefore lost sight of reality.  The scenes and situations were no longer credible and if accurate, I wouldn't want to live in that world.  But when I look at the early shows, so far they have been excellent without trying to reach for things that surely don't happen in the real world that we live in.  Season one was good.",1473811200,,554,4.339805825242719

Feel the series gets the handling of the snitch, Bubbles, all wrong. If really treated so cavalierly, he'd be dead in a hurry.  Also, the involvement of the judge with the investigation is not right, in my 43 years of prosecuting.  Maybe that's the way it is in Baltimore, but the ethics of the judge are compromised.",1473552000,,473,4.875

The characters and story arcs are true to real life to a greater extent than I have ever seen in a cinematic experience, while at the same time the plot is is perhaps the most involved and captivating I have seen. This show could easily be documenting real events with its grit, deeply flawed characters, and lack of any true good guys and bad guys. This show has tons of valuable lessons buried in each episode for the attentive and engaged viewer, and is an incredibly rewarding show to watch. Everyone should watch the first season.

The character development and stark realism of the streets of Baltimore is what makes this show standout. Baltimore is a character in and of itself in the show. The harsh realities of day-to-day society that play out, as they do in so many modern American cities, becomes a central player in every season and you can't help but become emotionally invested in it.",1472774400,,495,4.391304347826087

Even if you are not into crime shows this is a must watch. Give it a few episodes to set the pace and the story line.

2084042,5,B0002ERXC2,"I watched this when it first came out and HBO and loved it, and watching it again confirmed my initial reaction. Save for some changes in technology, The Wire could have been released today and be as relevant now as it was then. The theme of crime is woven into all 5 seasons with the ghettos of Baltimore serving as the front lines in the war against it. What makes The Wire so special is that each issue or group represented in any season is given brutally fair and humane treatment. There hasn't been a series as honest as The Wire in the history of television. And to add butter cream icing to this delicious cake of a series, the writers have seen fit to explore crimes' relationship to public education in the inner city, urban politics, the judicial system, and the role of the media and how technology affects it. Must see TV at it's very best.",1472774400,,852,4.39873417721519

Seemed like it was said in every other sentence. I can handle most words heard on TV and movies, but some words are so gross that I feel sick to my stomach. When they keep repeating a 'gross' word, like 'Snot', I can't focus on the story and I have to stop watching the show.  I have no idea what this show is about... other than one character seems to like saying really gross words.  I'm done watching this show.

This show is an unintelligent, stupifying bore, with extremely unattractive, unlikeable characters, who lead deathly boring lives. Relentlessly played out in the unchanging scenery of the gutter, with one thing hardly connected to the next.

2084131,5,B0002ERXC2,"The Wire didn't fully hit its stride until Season 1 Episode 4 in my opinion but after that there was no doubt that it was the absolute best that television ever had to offer (until Breaking Bad which is the only series that ever approached the same level of brilliance).

The place where The Wire beats out Breaking Bad is in the depth of acting: the numerous brilliant actors and actresses who made this one of the absolute high points that TV will ever reach.  Every character - both major and minor - is acted as if the actors' life depended on it and maintaining a continuous story arch that never ceases to fascinate over the course of a 5 year run is an achievement that has only been matched (but not exceeded) by Breaking Bad.

I have little doubt that even David Simon and Edward Burns were completely surprised at the success of their efforts.  At times the story line had to be changed.  Perhaps the show's most memorable character ""Omar"" ""(Michael K Williams) was scheduled to be in only 3 episodes as I recall but his character was so wildly popular that the show had to be modified to make him a major character throughout the series.

I remember posting incessantly on ""The Wire'"" fan board on the HBO site when the show was first airing and one episode especially (I will not tell you which it is) hitting me so hard that I could not make it to work the next day.

I cannot imagine drama on film ever reaching a higher level.  If it ever does I hope I am still alive to see it.  For the time being I think high end television has taken over conventional 2-3 hour films as the point where visual drama reaches its highest level.

But no matter how many 6/5 star series hit the airwaves (Breaking Bad, Justified, Deadwood) it is very difficult to imagine anything surpassing The Wire.

It was the best that anybody had ever seen in its day and it is an absolute ""must watch"" for anybody who is serious about film.  Even going back to Tarkovsky and Bergman, The Wire is at least on the same level.

An unrepeatable masterpiece that you absolutely should not miss if you have not yet seen it.  As a college professor I can attest to the fact that as of mid 2016 the vast majority of my 18-22 year old students have not ever even heard of it.

Unbelievable!

Major thanks to Amazon for making something that I would give a month's pay to see if I could only see it one more time available on Amazon Prime streaming which makes if practically free.

One of the greatest bargains of the century!

And my students had better plan on regular harangues about watching it.  Yes it WILL be on the test!",1472256000,9,2606,4.369294605809128

Crime, drama, dark, streets, lots of violence, organized crime, street people, drug addicts, love, life, winning, losing, politics, police work, city life, Baltimore, set in late 1990'- early 2000's if my memory is correct. Gritty, sexy, deep. Some of it is based in real life crime drug dealers. Very much an adult R rated series. I liked it better than Sopranos or Banshi. Addictive! The wire refers to wire tapping, tapping phone lines, and other digital tech in the fight on crime, but is only a small part of the stories. Characters you love and love to hate. Feels so real, it is scary. I must see. I think of course men will like it more but I can see how many women might be attracted to the interesting stories, intensity and the inteligence of the writing, acting.",1471651200,,784,4.607142857142857

2084245,5,B0002ERXC2,"David Chase's magnum opus starts off with a bang. Season 1 sets a magnificent table. Crime-ridden, dope infested Bmore, cynical jaded, careerist cops and embittered Murder Police, trying to clear cases and keep civilians safe, and a cast of gangsters that Tony Montana and Vito Corleone would admire. The Wire entered pop culture and the best tag lines are heard today. The dialogue is straight off the streets, the characters  are richly drawn and the sub-plots are a joy to follow. The good guys aren't all good and the bad guys aren't all bad, just like in real life. Every character gets some screen time. The parallel universes the cops and robbers occupy make a great juxtaposition. Both camps have to worry about chain of command, below-average workers, pressure to perform, and internal politics...oh, yeah, and money. How they handle their business is one of the joys of watching The Wire.",1471219200,,898,4.947019867549669

2084298,5,B0002ERXC2,"I lived in the Federal Hill area of Baltimore in the late 90's when ALL of the events being depicted (fictiously, of course) were surrounding me. My neighborhood was very nice (affluent and safe) but I drove through some of the areas shown quite often for work and can attest first-hand that this is spot on! Actors are talented, plot line develops steadily yet keeps a few twists concealed until one of the multitude of directors drops it on the viewer like a sledgehammer! Well done!! I'm a few episodes into Season 2 and would have liked to see more seasons before the show was cancelled. I feel the producers and writers chose to go out on Tomane succeeded!!

What I found most interesting was the nuances of the characters and the circumstances in which they  found themselves,  often means that, like in real life, people don't  fall neatly into one group or another (with the exception being the Senator Clay Davis character who is clearly a politician and a criminal).

2084600,5,B0002ERXC2,"Simply put, The Wire is the best dramatic series in the history of television.  A thoughtful five part arc that covers the decline of America's urban landscape in all its aspects - season one focuses on the drug wars and lays out the corrosive effects that this as had on the entire urban fabric.  Written by ex-Baltimore Sun writer David Simon the series is an al a clef of the fight for territory and the effects on citizens and players alike,  The police department is shown no longer policing, but being an occupying army trying to fight an always morphing enemy.  The show stars Dominec West  as Detective Jimmy McNulty, an alcoholic booze hound centered mainly on himself but who has a nack for making sense out of complicated puzzles.  Wendall Peirce is his partner, Detective Moreland aka Bunk.  Every character rings true and the situations are drawn from actual crimes in Baltimore - both in the drug wars and the political realm.  The overall effect is a stunning picture of how bureaucracies fail and how durg money corrupts everything it touches absolutely.
Given recent attention to policing in the US, and Baltimore in particular the show is as relevant now as it was in 2002 when it debuted.  It is not to be missed.",1469232000,5,1232,4.693023255813953

It is hard to tell at times just who the bad guys are...the drug dealers or the CYA and Personal Agenda Driven police bureaucracy. For that matter, there's some pretty serious stereotyping going on here with respect to the police....at least I hope it's unwarranted stereotyping!

2084694,5,B0002ERXC2,"Still some of the best writing on any television series ever.

We recently started rewatching, beginning with the pilot. It's amazing how organically all the exposition takes place. It has almost none of the clumsiness that you find with every TV show that came before it. Patience and confidence are apparent at nearly every step in the storytelling.

The audience is trusted to figure out what's going on, or to live comfortably with the uncertainty until it makes sense for the story points to be revealed. The characters are real, three dimensional human beings with relatable motivations and flaws. In some ways, it does nearly the impossible. You find yourself rooting for the ""good guys"" and the ""bad guys"" all in the same episode because they're all such interesting, sympathetic characters in spite of the awful things they may do in ""the Game.""",1468627200,,854,4.965034965034965

Society is breaking down, values are shifting, and we're drawn into a world comprised of people who have been written off  by society and those who prey on them: drug dealers, snitches, thieves, politicians, police.  Life is cheap and the atmosphere is poisonous; lives and careers are made and lost in a welter of petty feuds, overarching ambition and naked greed.  No good deed goes unpunished; no one emerges unscathed.  Brilliant writing, acting, directing, editing, photography all coming together.

2084863,5,B0002ERXC2,"Why did they ever take this off the air? The acting alone merits 5 Stars. This is real life, the struggle between Law and Lawless is a vast area of Gray and this show brings out the Gray perfectly. All of us who can walk down the streets at night and sleep safe in our beds have no idea about the war going on each and every night. This show speaks to the fact that many of our young can not find jobs, hope or a future so slinging drugs brings home money to pay the day to day bills...but at a price....no one dies of old age down on these streets. The Police have to cross the thin gray line to even slow down the drug traffic and pay for it with their lives or careers. The show touches on so many of our present social issues each episode could come out or today's headlines. Well Done! It's a shame it's gone.",1467849600,3,814,4.0

That said, this show starts pretty slowly, with a whole lot of exposition. However, the characters are all very well-played, and the story is compelling, though a bit confusing at times This, I feel, is due in large part to quickly spoken gang slang, coupled with semi-poor audio mixing in certain scenes. You ""get"" the ideas as things progress through an episode, but I there are a lot of moments where I feel like I'm missing something because of the ""sound"" issues.",1466380800,,543,4.666666666666667

2085080,5,B0002ERXC2,"I'm not sure why I didn't watch this series when it was on TV. I thought it wouldn't interest me but now I see that it is just the kind of drama that I like. There certainly is a lot of adult themes including language, sex, and violence which I would not be comfortable watching with some family members. Mostly I binge watched the entire first season, although it was broken into just few episodes each session. There is something so satisfying about binge watching.

I found the story line intriguing. Even though the cop versus criminals theme is pretty common, I found this different enough to keep me watching. I also like several of the criminal characters and don't want to see them killed off. This wasn't a series that any of my friends talked about. The only reason I started watching it was that I didn't have access to regular TV and was looking for something to binge watch. I remembering seeing The Wire on a list of the best TV series so I thought I would give it a try. Now I am so glad that I did.",1466294400,,1014,4.30890052356021

2085195,4,B0002ERXC2,"As a fan of ""Crime/Cop Shows"", I have very high standards for production quality, acting, directing and most of all, realism, and true to life drama. This is one of the better shows in this genre, and has a very loyal following even now,(2016) as well as it did when it was made.(2002)
Some reviewers have stated that this show is very real to life. I have to disagree. Being a person that has lived the lives depicted in this genre, I know what is realistic and what is ""Hollywood"". My major complaint is that this show is good, it has real situations and people, but then the Director seems to have to reach for more, and go over the top, to get his point across. IMO, this was not necessary, as the realism and the acting got the point across. The added ""Hollywood BS"" (HBS), tends to make a great scene, just a good scene.
I hope that Season Two continues to impress me.",1465862400,,874,4.303030303030303

2085447,5,B0002ERXC2,"Season 1 is great, as is Season 2. The series starts to drift during Season 3, to become more focused on the problems of life in the inner city, and becomes much less of a police procedural drama. By the time you get into Season 4, you almost forget you are watching a police show and are thinking you are watching a show about how hard it is to be a teacher in Baltimore public schools.

2085593,5,B0002ERXC2,"Welcome to the world of inner city drug dealing, not a pretty sight. It's TV, so there is the presence of over dramatizing at times, but the show is graphic about what happens in that world. Anybody that pays attention to the news, is aware of what parts of Baltimore are like today, but that's only a small part of Baltimore. The show is riveting at times, to the point of forgetting that it's a TV show. I like the show a lot, and have enjoyed all of the episodes, but like anything, it's not for everybody. I would recommend watching an episode, and see what you think. You just might get hooked. Hope this provides some insight. Happy viewing.

In their attempt to be authentic, the writers F-this, F-that, F-life, F-breakfast cereal and F-french toast too.  An F word variation is trotted out ever third word or s every third sentence or so.

I can say the actors are excellent but the overall theme of the show is mediocre.

What really surprises me is that the City of Baltimore PD actually allows the actors to wear their patches and portray themselves as Baltimore PD officers.  After watching, I can understand the very poor public perception of police officers these days because some people don't understand that this is hollywood and not the real thing so they form an even stronger hatred towards officers after watching all the corrupt and frankly stupid things these guys do and how it's swept under the rug by supervisors.

And the series did not (IMO) really become brilliant (though it was excellent) until season 2. Stay with it. SO worth it, I promise you.

I assume this is ""true to life"" as to how getto drug dealers communicate, but it still makes it difficult to understand and follow the plot.
The language and actions of the main good-guys (police) characters is also rather reprehensible, but again, probably true to life.

2086095,5,B0002ERXC2,"While it was mistakenly promoted as a crime procedural show, what The Wire is ACTUALLY about is a realistic and scathing portrayal of Reagan's misguided and dysfunctional ""War on Drugs"" and the damage it has done over the last 30 years to every city in America. Just the fact that David Simon's series officially ended on HBO in 2008 and continues to gather an ever-increasing cult following by the passing year should tell you all you need to know about the show's relevance. Simon was a crime writer for the Baltimore Sun for 15 years, working the police beat before writing the show, and basically created a parallel narrative over 5 years in the city of Baltimore portraying the corruption of an entire system which makes the problem of drugs in inner cities worse, not better. Several of the show's actors are not in fact actors at all, but actual former drug dealers that were pulled off Baltimore's streets and given a second chance by being on the show. Many now have programs to benefit Baltimore's inner city kids in various ways, and you can find interviews with them on the web.

From season to season The Wire exposes the problem from a slightly different angle, covering: the street-level dealers; the ports; the municipal government; the school system; and finally the press- showing how the flaws in each of these elements contribute to a costly and destructive system that keeps the very problem the drug war has portended to eliminate in place. If you are looking for a crime procedural in which you move from problem to resolution in each episode, you should go back to your NYPD Blue as this is NOT the show for you. Most of the heartbreaking problems in The Wire never get solved, anymore than they have been in real life. With stellar writing and seasoned character actors, you could not get a better near-biography of every U.S. city since the 1980s. It continues to spark a dialogue with thousands of new viewers even 8 years after the show went off air for a lot of really good reasons.

If you search online you will find a ton of blogs, YouTube videos and interviews, and very active comment threads discussing the topics brought to light in The Wire. Simon's own blog has some incisive commentary about things that happened while shooting the series, including multiple attempts by the actual mayor of Baltimore (after whom the mayoral character of seasons 3-5 was closely written) to intimidate Simon into shutting down the show altogether. Furthermore, in 2013, President Obama himself invited David Simon to the White House to discuss massive reforms of the ""war on drugs."" Perhaps one day the discussion The Wire incites will lead to real social change.",1461888000,,2685,4.796976241900648

While I found a lot of the language personally offensive and had difficulty understanding some of what was being said I found this series very interesting. It gave me a look into a world (authentic or not) I have never nor do I hope I ever visit. It made me realize how much I have to be thankful for being raised the way I was...in a home, neighborhood & town that I felt safe, secure and unafraid.

The only jarring note, for me, is the scenery chewing, over acting by the ""lead actor"" in the role of McNulty.....Given the prominence of Baltimore's problems in today's news, I found this series to be eye-opening and heart wrenching.  The official complicity in keeping the drug trade in business as long as it stays ""contained"" is a seething indictment of the status quo.....money and politics.......ambition and office politics....desperate poverty and the tragedies of addiction......misguided (if ""successful"") entrepreneurs....",1461110400,,699,5.6380952380952385

Kudos to the show runners and everyone responsible for the production and the pitch perfect writing and acting.  We live in a world that is spiraling downward into political correctness which is the enemy of free speech, though and expression.  It was probably a battle to keep The Wire true but it was worth all the effort.  It is worth the price of admission to Prime to watch it.",1461110400,,477,4.564705882352941

This is based on a life I know nothing of and find myself pausing at different times to take in what is happening. The similarities in personalities in the young men in the Towers to my boys and their friends.... Gratitude, perspective and back to the show. Incredible. I'm blown away by the interpersonal situations, I wanna strangle Jimmy and for his choices, I want to save Bubbles and I know Kima is filled with true wisdom knowing the limits of caring about a CI. It's real and unreal.
I find something in each character and I love seeing where it goes.

2086553,3,B0002ERXC2,"You know how it can be with streaming TV nowadays...often you sit through show after show mainly out of 'habit' more than anything...almost like spending time with your mate 24/7, because that's just 'what you do'...to change or try something different would require effort.  lol.  Well I find that's how it is for me with certain streaming TV.  The Wire would fall into that category.

I lasted through the end of Season One but finally had to admit to myself that I was watching the show out of habit, and not because I necessarily found it 'compelling'.

Overall the episodes felt pretty much the same.  I also had a hard time keeping the character names straight, and understanding how the various gangs did or did not work together or certain of their members overlap.  Who was 'playing' who?  At the end of Season One one of the major players gets killed and I was confused as to 'why' and who it was who 'gave him up'.

As for the realistic aspect of the show, in general it felt pretty good though there were a few scenes and lines that felt very unrealistic to me.  I also didn't buy the fact that supposedly none of the drug dealers had any clue that er...what's his name... the guy who would snitch to the cops for a price and who was always pushing around the 'Whitey Sale' shopping cart...I just didn't buy the fact that he could sit in the back of the cop car....and within eyeshot of the drug dealers...and nobody every noticed him interacting with the cops...nobody caught on to him?  A true snitch like him would have had to be way more careful and stealth.

I've decided to move on to a different streaming show and not watch any more of The Wire. That said, a few great actors IMHO on the show:

the Italian guy who plays the politician vying for the office of Mayor

the black guy who was like the 'Lieutenant' or something and who was the mastermind behind setting up the 'Amsterdam' zone

the black guy who headed up one of the gangs..I forget his name but he was the one who in the very beginning of Season One, gets let out of prison.  He's really great.

the young black kid who's one of the dealers...and almost looks more like a thugged-out girl at times...who has this very 'street' hip-hop way of talking...I get a real kick out of them...

the white cop who we generally only see on the beat....he's bald ..maybe early 40s with a round face.  His bald head, the way he carries himself, the way he talks...I could TOTALLY see him as an undercover cop in NYC.  He embodies your stereotypical macho undercover cop.",1459036800,,2541,4.458874458874459

Funny enough I've talked to several other people who thought ""the wire"" was a different series than this one as well.

The title ""The Wire"" comes from the fact that early on in the series, the detectives in the show figure out that in order to make criminal cases against the leaders of the outfits running drugs on the streets of Baltimore, they will need audio wiretapping surveillance to connect them with the lower level criminals actually working the streets. The wiretapping efforts are aided by some new advances in electronics technology but there is still much of a cat and mouse game between the cops and bad guys. But most of the show's action is still on the streets. The show also takes a wide look at all the players in the system having a stake including the judges, lawyers, prosecutors, cops, City Hall, state and local legislature, federal law enforcement (FBI), etc. The story line is rich, complex, and real-world. I can say the same for all of the show's seasons. Well done.",1458000000,,995,4.724137931034483

2086641,5,B0002ERXC2,"One of my favorite shows of all time. I have recently started to watch the show again from the beginning hoping that reality would nto tarnish my memory. So far, watching the show has been as satisfying as the first time. The show is so nuanced that on a second viewing you are able to pick up on many things that passed you by the first time.

The show refuses to deal in stereotypes or pretend that there are simple solutions to complex problems. No one is all good and even bad guys can do good things. It asks tough questions, Baltimore is protrayed as a drug ridden, violent place yet the writers clearely love Baltimore and the people of Baltimore who are trying to survive, trying to make it a better palce inspite of all of the obstacles.

If you want story where everyone is happy, where the good guys are good and the bad guys are bad, and where the problems are tied up in a neatly tied bow, this show is not for you. 0If you are interested in understanding inner city problems through the eyes of all the players, this is the show for you.",1458000000,,1051,4.276381909547739

2086643,5,B0002ERXC2,Truly a wonderful television experience.  Too often TV shows either lose their continuity or get boring trying to keep it consistent.

2086646,5,B0002ERXC2,"I'm sure this may have been discussed before about ""The Wire"" but I'll tell you my thoughts on the show. I've never been in law enforcement but it seems the show is very realistic is the way it portrays both sides of crime and prevention. Maybe the most realistic ""TV"" portrayal I've seen. Most of the time you get the perspective only from the law enforcement side, in ""The Wire"" you get the perspective from both the Police and the criminal side. From the first episode you begin to know the characters from both the Law enforcement and the Criminal side equally. You get to see a glimpse into the daily lives of both sides and what causes the situation that they are in. The first season focuses on a new Police team brought together to break up and arrest a local Drug organization. It is definitely an interesting take in a Police Drama, You actually begin to feel sorry for some of the people caught up on the drug dealing side because you see why they do what they do and circumstances that lead them there. The series also shows the frustration and cooperation or lack of cooperation from the Law enforcement side between the different departments, not much sugar coated here.  We are getting ready to start season 2 and looking forward to see the next part of the story and if it holds up as well as Season 1.",1458000000,,1318,4.446280991735537

We get a look at the inner workings of the BPD, and life in the drug game and it's not just from the gangsters prospective. We see the effects of drugs and violence that goes on in not just Baltimore, but nearly every ghetto in America.

It not only captures the characters but also the environment on the streets and the struggles of the police, drug dealers and drug fiends. It is as if the viewer is walking right in to the police station and into the neighborhoods of Baltimore. Watch it-

Everyone involved with The Wire should be extremely proud of what they accomplished. In a just world, it would have won multiple awards. Disappointing that it didn't.

Yes, it's got a great cast, with many of the stars going on to do award-winning series after The Wire.  So it was fun seeing familiar faces. The trouble is, The Wire is just another cop show that tries too hard to be hip and savvy.  It took at least a couple fo episodes to get up to speed on who in the hell is snitching on whom, and to wade through the thick jargon that seems practically like a foreign language.  The stories aren't compelling enough for me to care, and the characters are so hard-assed, it's hard to care about them, either. I can sort of see why the show garnered the awards it did, but since the Wire, cop shows have come a long way, and are just much better.",1455753600,2,809,4.173076923076923

2087266,3,B0002ERXC2,"Not a bad first season, though very slow moving at times.

Some interesting characters and a good cast, but writing has too many cop drama cliches. Most characters are full of rage for no reason, cops dislike everyone but their partner and all Feds, cop bosses and politicians are incompetent or corrupt. Alcoholism reigns in the PD--and of course, the central character is a loose cannon.

Cast out of the Dirty Harry mold, 40 years later.

That said, The Wire offers an extensive  inside look at the ghetto heroin trade not seen before.

But the theme of The Wire is even if you're smart and work hard, it doesn't matter. The game is rigged at every point. You can't win. Hopefully, this will change in later seasons.

The Shield is superior in every way.",1454716800,,757,4.611940298507463

2087335,5,B0002ERXC2,"The Wire is arguably one of the most well written dramas in the past few decades. Just an incredibly riveting series that set so many bars for television shows. On the surface you can call it a police drama, but it is definitely way more than that. The uniqueness of the series is how they treat both sides of the coin - the police side of the coin - their frustrations and bureaucracies all played out beautifully. Then the criminal side of the coin - the drug traffickers and kingdom - featuring very rich, deep characterization that goes way beyond the knee jerk portrayal of 'thugs' and 'punks'.

I watched it during its original run, but I recently turned a co-worker on to the series. I am re-watching the episodes along with his fresh eyes and it still holds up strong. I absolutely recommend this to anyone able or willing.",1454544000,,831,4.54

All I would have needed to do for a 240,000 word screenplay covering all characters would be insert F*** and its variations for 40 percent of the time, then go on vacation to write the rest of the work.  I put this junk down for several months, then opened it up again, and inside of three minutes, there it was again.  Over and over and over, like a two year old excited he can say the Naughty Word.  Hey, Marines - don't worry, hey you, black belt, hey you, MMA fighter - forget training, hey, Yazidi women being grabbed and raped and sold into sexual slavery by bovine hellspawn, you didn't have to be sold into slavery, all any of you had to do was shout F*** over and over and the armies of evil would flee in terror. The F word makes you tough, didn't you know that?.  I've been watching movies and TV shows for many decades, including many R rated, so I'm not prissy about the use of this word, it's just such a ludicrous, juvenile substitute for quality, dramatic writing.  I don't care what these so-called 'writers' have left to offer, I'm deleting this excretion from my watch list after this reaction posts.

Even if it is a bit dated (using payphones and beepers), its themes and issues still ring very loud and true today. This has to be one of the best takes on the classic ""cops and robbers"" or ""law and order"" type of show because of its very raw nature, along with an amazing cast and superb screenwriting.

2087942,5,B0002ERXC2,"This show is gut-wrenching and relentlessly raw, but I think it tries to present a vision of poverty and race relations in America that many of us rarely see in a way that doesn't preach, that keeps it messy, just like life.  No one is completely good or completely bad.  This is Shakespearean tragedy in our time.  I thought I was done with cops and robbers shows, but this takes it to a completely different level, and well worth the binge watching.  I did have to take a break because it became too heartbreaking to see the desperate lives of the boys in the 'jects.  How sad that in real life they can't just 'take a break'.  Will someone tell me there are glimmers of hope and redemption, or is the show just relentlessly depressing?",1448323200,,738,4.42962962962963

2087976,5,B0002ERXC2,"I'm a late comer to The Wire.
I got into gritty, dark crime dramas like The Shield, SouthLAnd, Breaking Bad or Low Winter Sun and always wanted to check out The Wire. I finally got around to doing that & it's a great, realistic show.  In fact, it's so realistic that it almost borderlines too much on the inner workings and intricacies of crime fighting in inner city, urban settings, and the lives of those who uphold the law & investigate to those who break it and try to get rich or die trying.  The complicated relationships and backgrounds to the characters are richly woven and brought believably to the screen in this ensemble cast show.

I haven't seen season 2 yet, but I know it focuses on a different aspect of the city ( the harbor/docks) as ti continues the storylines of the first season.
The 2014 dvd version I purchased was bare bones for special features but had good packaging.",1448236800,,895,4.512345679012346

I am now into the 4th episode of season 2 in a matter of 2 days... Some really good s***!  I know I am late to the party but just another reason to absolutely LOVE Prime from Amazon.

2088065,1,B0002ERXC2,I gave this show only one star because of the prolific use of profanity. I'm unable to enjoy any show whose writers cannot construct a sentence without using the f-word twice per phrase. I watched about 20-30 minutes. I tried to ignore the profanity to get to the premise of the story. I did not succeed. The language of use IS profanity. I turned it off.,1447718400,,355,4.393939393939394

2088067,5,B0002ERXC2,"Not the first time I have watched this series. Granted white liberals love this show and I suppose I'm one. But as a crime drama it is one of the most complex. Writing, directing, acting I can't find any holes. The cast is phenomenal. So many of these actors turn up in other series these days. It's virtually a who's who of superb actors (not just from the U.S.) from the highly experienced to the young first timers. Some of the actors weren't even actors before this series began.  The first season may seem dated these days given the kinds of technologies we have today. (Yes there was a device called a beeper.)  The thing I enjoy most is that it takes on the entire conglomerate of crime, law and order along with the political system and gives us an unexpected view of what the reality is (or was in Baltimore or still is) sans the moralizing you get from other crime dramas. Watch it. See if you don't hooked.",1447718400,,917,4.3882352941176475

Well written dialog for characters of all races, a tight plot that involves many people yet never loses the viewer - I was amazed that I could follow all the twists and bends of a story where loyalties and moral points of view are constantly shifting.

2088092,5,B0002ERXC2,"The Wire is highly lauded and deservedly so; what kept me away was not having cable.  I also thought the theme of the program might be too dark for me.  Since it was available on Amazon Prime, I decided to finally see what everyone was talking about.  I love the humanness of the characters.  They are vividly constructed, written and acted. It's actually the non-law enforcement, non-judicial characters who interest me the most, altho all of the characters are well-written & well-acted and non-stereotypical with the exception of some minor female characters.  I actually think about these characters after viewing the program and I have never done this with any other TV show including MM.  The show is a living breathing example of organizational behavior. It is dynamic, it is real, it is intelligent and it is sad.",1447459200,,821,4.913043478260869

The character development and growth are immense, the story engaging, the acting is seamless. The only thing I warn anyone who wants to pick up their own copy is be ready.

The show takes place on the streets with cops and criminals, what kind of language do you expect? Something for kids? Judge the content of the drama and acting but not a 1 star because the language offends you. I can see if it was overly racist or sexist or something to that degree (which it is not), but you don't have enough skin in the game after seeing half an episode. Hell the cinematography and the casting alone is worth 2 stars. Jeez, the people on this planet never cease to amaze. And what modern adult is really offended by language anyway? Mormons perhaps?

This is simply one of the best shows ever produced. But if you are fragile and can't handle f-bombs and other foul language then I guess you'll miss out. Oh well... sigh. Take your grown, man child self to binge watch Nickelodeon.",1446422400,,908,4.469879518072289

homicide division investigating drug crimes and getting yelled at by superiors can more or less sum up the first season

if you like detective shows then dive right in, if you were referred to this show after one of those ""what's the best show ever"" conversations know that this show does not hold a candle to Breaking Bad in a number of different areas.

2088584,5,B0002ERXC2,"""The Wire"" was an honest representation of what is happening in our world today. It shows that Law enforcement, political officials, and the judicial system, hold civilians to the laws while they don't hold themselves to the laws. ""The Wire"" shows the truth about young people trying for a much needed education. This need becomes almost impossible to achieve because of the politicians compelling law enforcement to break the rules. And subsidize the budgets by compelling law enforcement to bring in more revenue such as issuing more summonses often for minor offenses. This goes on while law enforcement, political officials, and the judicial system cover themselves from paying for summonses.",1444780800,,696,5.336363636363636

2088681,5,B0002ERXC2,"Completely brilliant first season of one of the best series ever on television.
A Baltimore homicide detective instigates for a deeper investigation into the city's drug kingpins. This makes him the target of his superiors who are more interested in image politics than real police work. ""The Wire"" also delves into the violent inner-workings of the drug trade, presenting the criminals as three-dimensional characters
Police procedural, crime thriller, character comedy, journalistic expose.
The first season of ""The Wire"" works as a stand-alone, self-contained narrative. However, once you have gotten involved with these characters (on both sides of the law) it will be impossible for you not to continue on with the subsequent seasons. (And--spoiler alert!--Season 4 might be even better.)
Highest Recommendation with the warning that you have to pay attention like you are watching a movie. Better than ""The Sopranos"" which aired at the same time on HBO.",1444176000,,959,5.442953020134228

It gives viewers a unique look into everything related to the drug game from the hoppers to the corner boys to the finance guys to the enforcers to the king pins to the cartels. On the government side, you get to see from street officers all the way to city hall. Most importantly, you get to see where they cross in good and not so good notes.

2088697,5,B0002ERXC2,"Hands down the best show ever. I have recommended The Wire to literally dozens of people, and all have come back with the same opinion, ""It's amazing!"". The characters, the interweaving storylines, the lack of network TV bull. You will never watch another cop show again without it feeling silly and unrealistic compared to The Wire. Law and Order, CSI and all the rest will seem like they were made for children after watching all 5 seasons of this show. Complex? Yes. Difficult to follow? Not at all. Deep characters? All of them, but not silly overcharacterization you'd find on network TV, they all seem real and most are based on real people. It may take a couple of episodes to really get into it, but I guarantee after 4 episodes you'll be hooked and you'll be sad it ends after season 5. Not because it's unsatisfying, but you'll feel so invested into so many characters it's hard to see them go. Almost every aspect of the dark side of modern society is touched on, but without any preachy editorializing. It's just there in all its grayness and ambiguity for the viewer to decide right and wrong, good and evil.",1444176000,,1121,4.61

Once you start episode 1 you will be finding it hard to stop until the season is complete.

2088872,5,B0002ERXC2,The Wire season 1 is one of the best seasons of any TV show that I have ever watched.  The first season gives you an inside look at the inner workings of the Baltimore drug trade as well as the police department that is tasked with policing them.  One drug case is played out through the entire season which provides incredibly in-depth case details and characters.  A lot of shows that focus on different cases in each show are not able to provide such a full look at a high level drug case as it plays out.  The show does a great job developing unique characters that fit right in to the storyline.,1442448000,,600,4.283185840707965

2088883,4,B0002ERXC2,"One of the nice things about being able to watch a show in bulk is you are willing to watch more than just the first episode. If we had watched this on TV one week at a time we may have given up. It starts out a little slow with quite a few characters to try to learn. It took us about 3 episodes to become hooked and we enjoyed the full season. Lots of critical acclaim for this show and for good reasons. The acting is not super outstanding but the story line and characters are what really pull it together. Not often in live you actually feel bad for the drug dealers.

Most cop shows just show the cop side of things. This series shows both sides of the picture which really adds to to the grittiness of live on the streets. Of course everyone drinks their troubles away, there is various bits of drug use, nudity and language but this is from HBO so you probably already knew that.

Parts are not super realistic of course. Every single person squeals their tires when driving. Um, not the best way to stay under the radar when following someone. They follow one car length back so both cars stay in camera frame. Sitting outside a house means just that, sitting directly outside the house with camera and binoculars in plain sight. Those who investigate crimes for a living will probably cringe in horror at a lot of these types of issues. You are going to have to look past all of that to enjoy the characters and the story line.",1442448000,,1437,4.2988929889298895

The storyline is edgy, with each episode ending on a moment when viewers are compelled to watch the next one.  This blows away everything available on TV today.",1442361600,,348,4.75

Excellent character development and acting and the background/setting very authentic feeling. There are a lot of take aways from every episode but not in a absolute or preachy kind of way actually there is no message you're just left to process what just happened.  It is not a light show but its not overly complicated or melodramatic and the focus in not on how gruesome the violent scenes are.

2089083,5,B0002ERXC2,"This is one gripping story which shows the brutality of the drug trade, where little guys are murdered daily to protect the bigger guys. It also shows how the tremendous amount of profit has corrupted the society, from the dealers themselves to their informants in the police department, correctional facilities, their lawyers, the whole justice system and politicians who take a piece of the pie. The turf wars, robbery, mutiny and betrayal seen in the series further engage the viewers and highlight the wretched power of quick big money has on people's minds. Throughout the show, you will also find characters stuck in a place where a choice has to be made between doing what they see as right, doing their best job or taking cues from the boss or other influential individuals in the organization with their very career on the line. Characters are complex, lots of times you can not say they are just good or bad. They are more likely to be somewhere in between, or switching frequently from one side to another just as in real life. Be warned, it has more gay / lesbian sex scene than hetero sex scene which may not be the taste of the majority audience.",1441670400,,1160,4.663414634146341

2089337,5,B0002ERXC2,Very engrossing and well acted.  Give yourself 4 episodes to get used to the gangsta talk. OMG is so well written and has great characters.,1440979200,,139,4.56
2089338,3,B0002ERXC2,Moved a bit slowly.  Almost lost me but last 15 min got intriguing. I might watch episode 2 to see story progress.  Nothing too violent for a cop show...but language is pervasively R rated - almost excessive...like just for shock value rather then to make a point.,1440979200,,264,4.595744680851064

2089352,5,B0002ERXC2,So many people had told me to watch this series because of how relevant it is to what is happening now in Baltimore.  The program is so well done and such an eye-opener.  It is not easy to take at times.  Lot's of violence and heartbreak.,1440979200,,238,4.130434782608695

It's like a book so good you don't want to put it down--so you click on the next episode and you're off on another wild whirl into the struggle against self, against crime, against corruption and all the while immersed to your neck just trying to stay afloat.  Kudos to the whole Wire cast and crew.",1440892800,,331,4.5

2089373,3,B0002ERXC2,"We watched one episode of The Wire years ago.  It was too violent and profane for our taste.  We decided to take another look after all the recent hoopla and we have stuck with it for two episodes.  The stories hold our interest in spite of the coarse language and depressing topics.  If this is a realistic portrayal of professionals speech, actions and methods, then this in itself is very depressing.  We will probably continue watching.",1440892800,,440,4.7368421052631575

However, it's so well done and realistic, and the message it sends is one we shouldn't ignore. The characters are well-developed, the acting is exceptional. My only problem is with my ear--some of the dialogue is delivered in such a fast-paced manner and the street and police dialects are tough for me to comprehend at times. I just started watching the second season and I'm not as engaged, although there are some of the same characters and the story line is continuing, with new characters and another plotline coming.

So many moments, it's shot so beautifully, and on top of that the themes that are all handled with a serene grace.

Its pace matches with the slow, gradual feel of a real investigation building up evidence and working the streets (as opposed to the ""long weekend"" feel of cases concluding over a period of a weekend on tv shows like Law and Order.) that could turn off initial viewers just getting into it, but if you commit yourself to at least 3 episodes, you'll be hooked.",1439078400,,442,4.828947368421052

Either I like it or I don't and this one was on the upper part of my list of five stars.. It might be a bit raunchy for some but it's pretty true to life..

Everyone should see this series at least once.",1438992000,,382,4.1066666666666665
2089692,5,B0002ERXC2,"I haven't been so excited for a TV show since I binge watched all three seasons of Luther. I was captivated by this world of drugs, a smart detective, a mission on a collision course with failure, intrigue, and tension all wrapped up in the urban jungle of the Baltimore Projects.

I started The Wire anticipating a hum drum cop show, like so many, but with a cast including the future James Bond runner up (betting odd put him in the forefront, now that we have a black US President, a black Bond isn't too far away) the brilliant Idris Elba of the afore mentioned Luther, I had to at least give this show a try and I have been hooked ever since. (I was disheartened to find him a bad guy, and a second tier one at that, but he ended up having a deliciously dark character with plenty of screen time!)

I have done about 13 episodes in 7 days, and while I am not super proud of the amount of time that is, I have also finished 2 books, my home teaching, and the church bulletin for Sunday, so I guess my time management isn't as abysmal as it looks (ahem Kitchen  yikes)!

The wire is completely captivating show. From the first episode I was wrapped up in the tension. It starts with a lone cop, played by Dominic Cooper - a familiar face which always helps for me - wanting to change the system up a little and actually make a difference in his city. Its an uphill battle and he slowly brings onboard other cops - Lance Reddick being another familiar face who seems to be in freaking everything on TV now days - until they are pulling him along a bit too. At the same time the tragic lives of young black kids growing up in the projects consumed by the power, money, and violence that has wrapped its tentacles around every facet of their lives, until they turn on each other, all for the sake of the game.

These two cultures collide in a slow and thoughtful war, a drama built as meticulously as the cops building their cases.
Conversations taped on wires, cloned pager numbers, cops camped out on rooftops, the monotony of police work captured and lived as we learn and delve into a few of the detectives lives. At the same time we see the other side, the lives of the young hoods corrupted by the older gangsters. Seduced by the glory. Its an in-depth study characters, but also a look at two companies, two organizations, and you almost respect the gangsters more than some of the backstabbing butt kissing cops.
The show isn't for the faint hearted. I was impressed that HBO was able to do a show without extreme amounts of graphic nudity (barely R rated) but the profanity and some of the crime scene photos are not for the faint hearted. Its a gritty portrayal of two gritty professions.

I loved almost every minute of this first season, and whats more it was done so well that the 13 episodes is a story all in its own. Its solid. I could leave the show alone and still have a satisfactory beginning middle and end, a perfect mini-series. I am almost reluctant to continue in case it turns into Dexter or The West Wing two brilliant shows that fizzled into repetitive clichd parodies of themselves after two or three seasons.
So while I cant yet speak for the rest of the show, Season 1 of The Wire is a masterpiece.",1438992000,,3229,4.355481727574751

It took 6-7 attempts of the first and second episodes to begin to get into it. But eventually I did. And it was sooooooooooooooooo worth it. It's hard to keep up with all the characters and the plot at the same time but when you do you'll want to go back and watch it again to see what you missed.

I was so interested that I purchased the boxed set as soon as possible.  Fortunately, I had the summer off because I could NOT stop watching it.  I have watched the entire series more than once again.  Even though I know what's going to happen, I always see something new on subsequent viewings.  When I came across The Wire on Amazon Prime, I couldn't resist checking it out .  I own every season of The Sopranos; we watched weekly on HBO and purchased each season as it became available, but I have not re-watched every episode of every season of The Sopranos.

2090414,4,B0002ERXC2,"I am a fan of cop shows ever since Hill Street Blues. I like hard-nosed gritty police dramas and The Wire is definitely up there with the best of them. The characters start out in season one already very well developed and the relationships very well established. The show is filmed very well, and even though it clearly is influenced by many of its forerunners, the show has its own unique identity,slant and color palate on certain aspects of inner city police work for the time and place portrayed. (Baltimore in the wary 2000's) Many of the tropes used by the show's creators/writers are very familiar but with some added depth depicting life within a system that lacks the technology, manpower and political will to make a lasting difference other than provide a modicum of check and balence to the impoverished drug infested poverty of Baltimore's inert city projects.
  Many of the lead characters, both cops and thugs, seem to have an amount of appreciation, if not some empathy, for each other's situations and circumstance. This isn't a typical ""Good Guys Vs. Bad Guys"" type of cop show. The Wire shows some very human and sometimes complex sides to the cops and the thugs.

  One gets by watching this series that everybody has good and bad in them and that a lot of life just depends on which side of the line you happen to land.

I've only watched a few episodes into season 1. It will be interesting to see where the show goes. If it just repeats the same tropes over and over again in a formulaic way, or whether new tropes emerge while old ones fade out. Hopefully the perspectives of the characters grow and evolve and can eventually help viewers gain an insight to an aspect of humanity.

Good  television series makes people think. This show has made me think a little bit in its first few episodes. I take that as s promising sign that The Wire is not just another distraction from life but another tool, another perspective on life...",1436659200,,1955,4.630057803468208

Even though it's years later, after binge-watching, only because I kept hearing how good this show was, I feel like a fool.  From Ep. 1, I was totally hooked.

2090923,5,B0002ERXC2,"A tense look at the inner city turmoil of baltimore, from every possible pertinent angle. From the low level street soldiers peddling drugs to fiends all the way up to those reaping all the spoils of the war on drugs.  From the nameless beat cop, to the insignia flashing Majors, and money shuffling senators. Throughout all that we find ourselves rooting for 'good' people who do despicable things, and 'bad' people who are trying to do the right thing.
We stumble across addicts trying to change their lives around only to shoot up again the next day. We meet cops trying not to make a fuss about the decay of the justice system so they don't jeopardize their chances at a promotion. Some hard working detectives who want to find the truth against mounting pressure from superiors who are afraid their skeletons might be revealed. Gangsters with a conscience, and monsters with no remorse. By the end of the season you begin to doubt yourself when you think about who's who. The boys in blue terrorize the neighborhood with almost as much gusto as those drug dealers protecting their territory.
Is it the classic a ""few bad apples ruins the bunch"" mentality that breeds this problem? Or is it more complex? Is the whole system corrupt to the core? We see good people do things we'd be against, but it's all for the ""greater good"" so we let it slide, but what else will we let slide when the stakes are raised higher?
We see honorable men and women lie cheat and steal, but we soon learn nothing is black and white. And yet out in those baltimore streets that seems to be all you can find.",1434499200,,1590,4.54006968641115

The vast amount of believable characters that make up this show are very compelling. The commentary on the problems in police departments, racial profiling, and political corruption in Baltimore really resound throughout America.

2090957,5,B0002ERXC2,"""The Wire"" has been described as the best TV drama ever, and other comparable superlatives.  For years I avoided watching it, because, given its subject matter, I thought it would be depressing.  (I'm a former public defender; these are my clients; their stories are depressing.)  Well, it IS just about the best TV drama I've ever seen.  It is saved from being depressing, for me anyway, by (1) the generally excellent performances, and (2) the brisk storytelling--there's too much going on for you to become depressed over the story.  If you care about good storytelling you won't be disappointed. (Image is from Season 4 premier.)",1434412800,3,633,4.9904761904761905

My only complaint is that the police corruption and incompetence is so blatant as to be unbelievable.  Cops beating witnesses in interrogation rooms is routine, many cops are alcoholic derelicts, and several high-level officers are ""on the take.""  If that's even close to the truth about Baltimore, the Feds or State-level forces need to take over the city police, like they did in 1930s Kansas City.  Judging from recent events in Baltimore, it appears to be accurate, so I plan to avoid the city.",1434412800,,639,5.105769230769231

""D"", one of the central characters who sells drugs/manages the drug sellers in the ""Towers"" (which is in the projects in baltimore) becomes a very likeable character.  mcnulty, one of the central character cops, is a real self-centered jerk, but a great cop.  all of the characters are excellent actors, and some are likeable and some are irritating, but they are all excellent at portraying who they are.  all in all, it is a very good show, and i am now up to watching season 3 (using amazon prime).  i just wish they wouldn't have killed off many of the likeable characters :-(  i won't tell you which ones, since you need to watch to see!

Not your typical cop drama, although one of the lead characters (McNulty) is played by a British actor who doesn't quite nail an American accent.  Also, the character's relationship with his ex-wife, his womanizing and drinking are kind of a cliche.  That said, the show definitely goes deeper than most cop shows.

2091481,2,B0002ERXC2,"ok. I don't get it. The wire like The Sopranos and Mad Men is slow and plodding with a little drama or action to force storyline advancement every few episodes just so you don't nod off. I watched the whole series just to make sure I wasn't missing what everyone seemed to be so hyped over and in the end I don't see why everyone thinks it's so good. It is slow to the point of cold molasses. It builds toward drama that never delivers. The thing that makes this even worse than shows like Lost, that people were so aggravated over, is that these shows (The Wire or The Sopranos) don't even have unanswered questions or mysteries as redeeming qualities. In the end they're just DULL. They had potential but fell flat on account of poor story development. Plain old boring.",1432944000,4,772,4.443661971830986

Instead, I am going to be philosophical about it and pronounce that The Wire is the reality show that gives me a glance into a world that is too frightening for me to venture in at any capacity in real life. Everyone should watch The Wire for entertainment but I hope everyone who watches it thinks about how wonderful it would be if all parties represented in the show would put aside self-preservation, self-interests and territories, and really concentrate on helping each other overcome ignorance, greed, racism, apathy, and heartlessness.",1432944000,,666,4.902654867256637

Excellent acting, sets, cinematography, scripts, etc. It details how law enforcement works inside corrupt government and how a right-fighting person, like the lead detective, get regularly mistreated. There is a lot of humor mixed into reality. Season one is set in the urban street drug market in Baltimore. Season two focuses on dock corruption and the unions in Baltimore. The viewer travels with the same main police figures and citizens as others are added and eliminated. By the end of the series, everything not previously explained is explained. We felt like we lost our family when the series ended. Moral to the story: Justice is a rarely seen commodity in life and in this series, but then there's Omar.

2091849,5,B0002ERXC2,"Still the greatest show of all time (even better now that it is in HD).  With the advent of the riots in Baltimore, this show has only become more relevant and timely.  I really can't say enough about this show, it truly deserves a 100% rating.  10/10 on imdb.  The show is definitely NOT for everyone but you can't possibly please everyone when making a TV show... or Movie... or song.  No matter what media you chose as your form of expression, there will always be someone who hates it.  Haters gonna hate.

This show is a true story of life on the crime riddled streets of Baltimore.  It was written by people who saw it first hand.  And are still seeing it today.

This show requires a class titled ""An Introduction to The Wire"" because it comes right out of the gate shooting and doesn't let up.  Every character is in the first episode.  And they throw the viewer right into the legal process that is our justice system, the Baltimore Police Department and the ""kids"" living on the streets of Baltimore.  Probably one of the most defining characteristics of this show (compared to most Cop Dramas) is how you see BOTH perspectives, Cops AND criminals. You see life from the perspective of the ""kids"" on the street... and I am using quotes when I say kids for many reasons.  A good friend of mine stopped watching the show in Season 4 because it became too emotional heavy for her. This show is HEAVY.

The Wire is complex.  If you give it a few episodes and actually pay attention, you will not be disappointed.  Another tip if you are struggling with this show... turn on the subtitles.  The true language of the streets, cops and whoever is not always easy to understand... even hardcore English linguists will be blown away.

Not only will you see life on the streets in Baltimore from the perspective of the cops and the kids on the streets... you will also get a view into the complex lives of the drug addicts, lawyers, politicians, school teachers, dock workers and Judges.  Every character on the show is just trying to survive the complex institutions they have become a part of... the BPD, drug dealers, our legal system... family was the most complex and heart breaking system on this show.

So go ahead and compare this show to other cop dramas but IMO it does not compare at all.  The Wire aired from 2002-2008 (A year after I moved to Baltimore).  The Wire will entertain, educate (hopefully not confuse) and cry TODAY and for years to come.  Wait... what is a BEEPER? The only TV show that can compare to The Wire in quality, social message, complexity and re-watch-ability is the Twilight Zone.",1431302400,,2617,4.554603854389722

2091852,5,B0002ERXC2,"Currently on Season 3 of this stellar show, and I have to say, I had to watch the first episode twice, but after I watched it the second time, I've gotten hooked. This show has an awesome cast and it's great to see how many actors and writers cut their teeth on this show and where they are now because of this show. Season 1 is crazy and mirrors the real-life issues of Baltimore.",1431302400,,381,4.162162162162162

2091862,5,B0002ERXC2,I normally don't write reviews but a recent review state that this was a terrible series and I must disagree strongly with that assessment. The wire is one of the best if not the best tv series to hit the screens. It is close to real life as Ive ever seen especially growing up in a similar setting. I can understand not liking it but to say it is distasteful and such doesnt do it justice. The individual that wrote that terrible review either lives in a shoebox or not in the real world.,1431216000,,489,4.212765957446808
2091863,1,B0002ERXC2,"After about ten minutes of non-stop, foul-mouthing by what I assume are the ""good guys"" in this series, I knew it was not something that would entertain or enliven, inspire or uplift, so that was the first-and-last episode of THE WIRE for me.  There is more than enough of the crude, profane, obscene, and disgusting in the news and the world at large.. Why anyone would choose to spend precious personal time immersing him or herself in such unapologetic, unrelenting squalor of mind and spirit is beyond me. If THE WIRE is ""true to life,"" then it represents a reality about which I do not wish to know more.  As one who loves the English language, I find the dialogue in this program to be in a language almost wholly foreign to me and my experience over a long lifetime - a language with no redeeming social, intellectual,  spiritual, or artistic value. Those who speak this foreign tongue are so alien to my world and do such violence to decent, civil, human expression that I find any further voluntary submission to such unpleasant verbal assaults unthinkable.  I have no idea what the plot(s) might have been but was unwilling to spend one moment more with the thoroughly distasteful characters who introduced the story lines. They made me want to seek other company - FAST - so I did.  . .",1431216000,,1297,4.621739130434783

2091865,4,B0002ERXC2,"I enjoyed the 1st season of The Wire.

The actors choosen to play each of the main characters, and even those in the supporting roles, are believable and interesting at some level because they mirror experiences that the citizen-viewer can relate to.
At some level, the viewer recognizes the good and the bad in the organizations represented as something s/he knew or suspected .

I look at it this way-there are three types of TV programming: network, cable, and pay. The best network show was ""Law & Order."" For cable, it was ""Breaking Bad."" For pay TV, it's ""The Wire."" Since all three have ended their runs, and have had time to compare and contrast, I would rate The Wire the best TV show ever, just by a nose over Breaking Bad.

I'm old enough to remember when police and federal agents actually had to have proof and cause before listening and watching everything we do. A good show with some excellent actors, there are some stereotypes but not so poorly done that it makes the show unwatchable. At least it includes some cops who work hard to keep us protected while following the rules.

Great show, I loved it, maybe you will to. Give it a shot while its on prime. Ooohh, also it is dated.

2092058,4,B0002ERXC2,"Listen, ladies and gents, this show is a masterpiece. Well worth it to watch all five seasons. You will immerse yourself in a community/culture at a level that transcends most television. That being said, both seasons one and two take a little orientation and focus to get into. This is because the show introduces so many characters at first, and takes the proper time to let the viewer acclimate to their respective stories. That's the only reason that season one and two got four stars instead of five. Otherwise, this show is perfect. That is, if you like a story-driven drama. This show is like real life. Lots of ups and down. Lots of losses and not much victory. Justice doesn't always happen. Characters make heart-wrenching decisions in heart-wrenching circumstances. Sometimes it is very anti-climactic, just like life. So, if you are looking for fast-paced action with explosions, keep looking.

2092145,5,B0002ERXC2,"The Wire is not just great television; it is important television.

Many comparisons are made to the excellence of this series. However, I cannot think of a single drama--outside of this one--that rewards the viewer, repeatedly, each time one goes back for a re-watch.

If The Wire had not been so ahead of its time--in forcing adult themes upon the perpetually adolescent American public--and been an AMC series, I can imagine fifteen to twenty characters who I, and I presume the public, would love to get to know via an origin story series.

Who would not like to know more about:

- What young Daniels was up to that got him in so much hot water with Chief of Police.
- Bunk and McNulty's early years.
- The previous generation of Barksdales.
- The rise of Prop Joe.
- Marlo Stanfield's early years and struggles.
- Who ran docks when the Sabotkas were young.
- Where the Greek came from?
- Brother Muzzone's career, and the story of his regular employer in NY.
- Omar's early years.
- Levy's ""other"" clients.
- The rise of Clay Davis.
- Where Snoop came from? I mean, we know ""where"" she came from, but her story would be fascinating.
- Young Gus chasing stories down.

And so many more. David Simon gave us such rich, interesting characters, they populate our imagination even when they are not a part of a scene or storyline.

I am so thankful for this series' evenhanded peek behind the curtains of a single city, as it let me know what television could have been (if we had a more discerning public).

This is a must watch for anyone, young or old.

One more thing: How is Netflix going through great pains to bring back Full House and Arrested Development, giving untold millions to Adam Sandler to produce content ""at a future date,"" and giving so many millions to any comic that will do 45 minutes of stand-up in a dark room, but have not put together a team to bring any of these Wire series ideas to fruition?

Everything has a number, even David Simon. Full creative control and a House of Cards-like budget should be enough to close the deal.

Let's make this happen!",1429660800,,2083,4.50132625994695

Anyway, a really good procedural cop show set in gritty Baltimore. A great ensemble cast, both cops and dealers. Throw in an occasional role reversal (cops as scumbags and honorable dealers) and this series has it all. Detective McNulty (the lead) is a complicated man, not without his (glaring) faults. The episodes are wonderfully written with realistic (for the '90's) dialog. Direction is fast paced and sometimes really innovative. Give this a watch.

The reason why I wouldn't give it four stars, and it's a bit unfair, but it's no Breaking Bad.  What I mean is... BB left you on cliffhangers making you WANT to watch that next episode because you HAD to see what happened next.  This show didn't do that.  I know it's apples to oranges and I'm trying not to compare the shows content wise but the week to week draw.  Wasn't there as much with this series.

The two guys who wrote the show, Ed Burns, a retired Baltimore Police Detective and David Simon, who works for the B-More Sun Times wove an intricate tale that all started in the first season.

The show featured some local Baltimore talent and was filmed entirely on location in B-more.  The actors were all really good.  One of the actors, who played a Baltimore Police Homicide Sgt. is in real life a Baltimore Police Detective Sgt. working in a homicide unit.  So many pieces of this intricately woven tale were set up in season 1.  From opening to closing, it is the best tale told on TV.",1429401600,,806,4.448979591836735

2092316,5,B0002ERXC2,A bit dated but fun to watch. We enjoyed the accurate replay of the crack scourge in the lower precincts. The draconian drug laws which were originally demanded by the representatives of the underclass communities are now the same politicians who demand their repeal due to their predictable but disproportionate effect on African-American males. This first year's episodes adds fodder the debates on the success of the war on drugs.,1428710400,,433,5.2

2092341,5,B0002ERXC2,I strongly recommend using closed caption to make sure you can understand all of the dialogue. Once I did that I could follow the narrative much better. Many complex characters and multiple plot lines. Very satisfying too to binge watch.,1428710400,,237,4.95
2092342,5,B0002ERXC2,Hands down one of the best series on TV. It held nothing back. There was great acting and you really cared about the characters.

2092357,5,B0002ERXC2,"By now this show is a classic. It has a strong story and excellent acting. All the characters, cops, criminals, and victims, have human complexities. In spite of its setting in the violent world of the street drug trade, it does not emphasize scenes of violence or drug use -- it's about the people. I watch it with closed captioning on, or I would miss quite a bit of what the drug dealers say.",1428537600,,395,4.351351351351352

2092379,5,B0002ERXC2,Best show I've ever watched,1428451200,,27,4.6
2092380,5,B0002ERXC2,"For cop show fans, The Wire is a must see. More than a procedural, more than a defective detective chronicle, more than a sum of crime drama stereotypes, The Wire's gritty realism captures a segment of American society in a way that is both thought provoking and entertaining. Explicit sexual content, (a characteristic of HBO ""adult"" dramas), is kept to a minimum. Explicit violence is not, but never comes across as unwarranted or exploitative. Traditional boundaries defining hero and villain are blurred in an engaging storyline that is expertly rendered on all levels. The Wire sets a standard for American police/crime drama that is rarely, if ever, achieved in the entertainment industry. All that said, it needs to be noted that the depiction of the use of firearms by law enforcement does not reflect current (2014-2015) revelations on police behavior seen in the media.

The Wire is not for children and I would personally exercise caution recommending it to young teens.",1428451200,,981,5.093167701863354

2092395,4,B0002ERXC2,Great plots if you can get past the language. The show would be just as good if they cut back on the bad language. It gets irritating and distracting. Always tempted to stop watching.,1428364800,,183,4.411764705882353

2092782,5,B0002ERXC2,"This is going to be my new crime show. It's better then CSI, Law and Order, and Breaking Bad combined.

It shows the two sides of the story: police and gangs. Half of the show focueses on the side of law enforcement, while the other half shows us the point-of-view of the criminals. This is the type of story that keeps me on the edge of my seat.

The Wire is going to be a great show for me to watch. My advice: watch it.",1427068800,,422,3.9529411764705884

My efforts to do so were very richly rewarded.  I can't imagine anyone rating this Three Star because it seems to me an either love-it-or-hate-it series.  Since a genre can almost not be too dark for me,  I'm right in my element & feel (appropriately) addicted to my daily fix of this.

In episode 4, I think, the 2 partners spent a whole 15 minutes (it seemed like) saying nothing but F-bombs,  in all their variety...literately no other words were spoken. I spent 27 years in the Army so its not like I have not heard that language before, but come on, enough is enough.

2093123,5,B0002ERXC2,"First, to be clear, this series is excellent. All 5 seasons. I commend it to you, with suitable cautions for profanity, violence, and some mildly explicit sex. My attraction to The Wire may be a bit idiosyncratic, so it seems fair to expose its basis for the reader to judge.

It is not a crime mystery. The bad guys are apparent and in a sense eternal. It is not a morality play. The righteous do not prevail. They win some and lose some and by the end it's tough to tell the score, and even hard to identify the righteous. It is not an action/adventure, though there is plenty of action and adventure to keep our attention.

Instead, the series is a portrait of the American city at the beginning of the 21st century with Baltimore as the paradigm. It uses the struggle to establish the rule of law as the principle dramatic vehicle. Each season the crime/enforcement theme is supplemented by sub-themes from other aspects of the urban institutional environment, the industrial economy, the political system, the educational system, the press, the other traditional pillars supporting the city. The failure of the city is intimately tied to the failure of each of these pillars, and the series makes it clear that this nexus of failure occurred within the memory of the older adults who populate the tale, those old enough to have seen their children reach adulthood.

The compelling power of The Wire is it portrayal of the human scale consequences of the failure of the city, the consequences on individual lives and the microcosms of urban life, the corner, the stoop, the office, the shop, the classroom, the courtroom, the bar, the home, the family. The impact isn't static and passive, it is dynamic and adaptive and smart. When the system doesn't work, when it has failed catastrophically, those caught in the mess carve out new rules, make new institutions, find new solutions. They aren't stupid. They're creative and energetic and hard working and ambitious. But they're also not wise. The solutions they create to short term immediate problems make things worse in the long term.

The great mystery is how all these different mutually supporting systems could have failed at once, with such catastrophic consequences. The series offers a number of candidates. Corruption is offered as partial explanation, but not simply the petty corruption of money and greed, though certainly it plays a role. There is also the corruption of ambition for power and status, and the corruption of evasion and cowardice. But perhaps the most insidious corruption of all is the corruption of righteousness, the reckless oblivion induced by the belief that a noble goal justifies ignoble means.

Drugs are clearly presented as another source of decay. An experiment in controlling drug related crime that actually works (in fiction at least) is quashed after a brief flirtation because it offends the ideals of the community. It is hard to know what conclusions to draw from this but in the real world I watch Colorado and Washington state with interest.

Measurement is an odd villain of the piece. Statistics and testing, we are told, are obstacles to law enforcement and education. I found this to be sadly superficial. Certainly managing the numbers rather than managing the processes is foolish and corrupt, but that is a failure of bad management, lazy and superficial supervision, rather than a consequence of measurement. Feelings and Caring and Commitment are weak substitutes.

In the end the urban mandala has spun through a cycle, archetypes are reincarnated, innovations are banished, and the beat goes on. All that changes is that the viewer has had a chance to gain a better understanding of the state of things. We are not offered any glimmer of hope that the dynamics of the urban environment can improve.",1426377600,3,3816,4.953125

2093142,5,B0002ERXC2,"This is my second time watching this fine series. In many ways, it is modern Shakespeare; at times lyrical, hilarious and ultimately, tragic. We are made to care about each of the characters in the fine and delicate writing, from the speculation about the McNuggets' creator, to McNulty's working the case to the calamitous end. The victory seems hollow, as a police is down and the one boy, Wallace, who wanted nothing more to do with any of it, is dead. Dee, who takes the fall for Stringer and Avon is horrified when he finds out from the police interview that Wallace is one of the bodies that just pile up over the drugs; the one he knew for a fact would never snitch takes the 20 and begins to read and learn in prison. But, he isn't safe there; there are hot-shots, a network that reach from the high-rises into the penitentiary. All Dee really wants is what Wallace wanted. A place to breathe free. It is a telling want: the chance to really be a free man, without worrying about the consequences of a wrong action, either a demotion or a bullet. To say nothing of the competition. To make the whole thing just a bit eerie, we have Omar, who robs drug dealers and his telling whistle ""the cheese stands alone"" almost puts us on ""Nightmare in Elm Street"" territory. Not a line or a scene or a situation is wasted in the first season of ""The Wire"". It is simply the finest show I have ever witnessed; I'm sure when I watch it again, I'll pick up more.",1426291200,,1457,4.360294117647059

2093342,5,B0002ERXC2,"The Wire is hands down the best crime series ever written for television.  Its characters are diverse and interesting.  The story is starkly realistic and character-driven.  Omar Little, a homosexual drug robber who is motivated by street morals and the desire to avenge a slain lover and confederate, is one of the best characters ever written for TV.  Senator Clay Davis is phenomenal.  The characters of Detective Jimmy McNulty, Detective Lestor Freamon, Detective Kema Greggs, and Detective Bunk Moreland are each wonderfully complete and idiosyncratic in their own way.  Lt. Cedric Daniels sets the archetypal mold for best unit commander on a crime show, in my opinion.  The list of great characters goes on and on. The criminals are just as fascinating as the cops, politicians, teachers, union bosses, and newspaper men.  I can't think of another show that provided a more diverse array of roles for African-American actors.

The Wire involves an intricate web of characters and subplots that stretch across its several seasons.  That intricacy is perhaps why the series was not recognized for its greatness when it first aired on HBO in the early 2000s.  But it is, in fact, a great show, albeit one that the viewer has to invest time in to understand and follow.  I heartily recommend it.",1425945600,,1298,5.014018691588785

2093529,5,B0002ERXC2,Decided to begin watching this series and am happy that I did.  The story line and the numerous characters both ciminals and cops are really good to follow.  I finished Seson 1 and am currently in Season 2 which has followed all of the characters from Season 1 and as it has progressed has become an even better watch than the first.  I did not know this series from HBO was highly acclaimed but I now know why it is.  Great acting and the story line keeps one guessing as to what will happen next.  Will continue to watch till the end of all the seasons and series as I have other HBO really good series they have broadcasted.

Usually when I try to get into a series I lose interest after a few episodes.  This is one of the only shows I've ever watched that keeps me completely absorbed from start to finish without my mind starting to wander.  I think the best word to describe it is riveting.

Great acting and character development. as well as photography. This series provides an in depth look of life in a city drug dealing world.  The cops and judge are as bad as the ""bad guys"".

It's like as if Law and Order ran story lines across multiple seasons and allowed the occasional sex scene. But they had a couple extra really good writers and actors and didn't need to fill the 65+ demographic.
I'd give it a shot. What are you gonna do? Watch deadwood again? At least they finished this series! Freaking HBO. And don't think you're safe with game of thrones either GRRM writes slower turtles tip toe.",1424476800,,511,4.565217391304348

Everything is pitch perfect from the dialogue to the casting and I am enjoying this series immensely.  Also, it turns out that Dominic West, lately of the Showtime series The Affair, plays good ole Jimmy McNulty on The Wire and it's really a treat to see this great actor at work.

2093854,5,B0002ERXC2,"Ok. This is my first review and I think this show deserves it. I was hesitant to watch it because of how old it is. The reason I decided to give it a shot is because I was listening to the wrap up show on Stern. They said something along the lines of it being the most important cop drama show you'll ever watch. They were right. I've never felt like I understood the politics and intricacies of how things worked through all the other BS crime dramas that are on TV. They make it seem too easy, and it probably is. This, I feel, is the most accurate portrayal of what's going on in the police officers world when dealing with this situation. I'm towards the end of the first season and I'm hooked. If you're a crime drama person and you're on the fence about this, I highly recommend it.",1424390400,,788,4.190789473684211

2093982,5,B0002ERXC2,"The first episode was so-so and I wasn't quite hooked but I decided to continue watching and became a fan. I find it much more likable than a CSI show because they aren't solving one case per episode, rather it is one continuous case throughout the whole season.  With this being said, the are not any cliff hangers at the end of the season.
The show also gives a bit about how each character is by showing some scenes that go into the characters life. This makes getting to know the character work well and you can justify how much you like a character or don't.
I think it represents real policing/detective work more than CSI.",1424390400,,629,4.422413793103448

2094045,5,B0002ERXC2,"The episodes that preceded ""The Game"" actually condensed the primary characters into human beings that can be recognized in our world order. Mainly, The Game serves as a metaphor for why so many people today seemingly lack trust in politics and associated good citizens who seemingly control that public trust.
Moreover, it also helps to realize that drama based upon fact can be reminder of what our society needs to address.",1423180800,,426,5.014084507042254
2094046,4,B0002ERXC2,"Count me among those who find The Wire to be the greatest television show ever, and by ""greatest,"" I mean having the most serious intent, commitment to authenticity, and intellectual content. What seems to be a police procedural (and it only seems to be one: the viewer discovers that it is not by the second season, and its full scope--the city of Baltimore from street corner drug pushers and addicts to those who inhabit its corridors of power--only becomes evident by the third season) is about ideas, specifically the many ways in which our nation has gone dreadfully wrong, and its corruption and decadence, not in any lurid or moralizing sense, but in the strict sense of failure to live up to its purported ideals and a paralyzing weakness that results in an inability to change. But it is not a documentary, or even a didactic drama: no single character articulates this theme, nor is this a culminating catharsis foisted upon the viewer. Instead, it is the conclusion one reaches after accumulating a mountain of small details, just as the drug case that is the narrative backbone of the first season is made not from any one piece of evidence, but a great curated collection of actions, transactions, and conversations.
This stance that ""all the pieces matter"" means that criminal enterprises--to name but one organization the series places under scrutiny--in The Wire are the result of small, coordinated acts by numerous people, and so many expectations viewers have of a police procedural will be frustrated: there are no gun battles, or car chases, or dramatic confrontations between cops and criminals. In fact, The Wire seems to delight in frustrating and ridiculing these expectations: the first time a cop fires his gun in the series is by accident, and then while in the office, and tactical teams lining up to smash down doors are told to stand down and calm down by detectives who know their quarry, and that the weapons of choice for these criminals are not guns, but skilled defense attorneys.
The DVD sets of The Wire, unfortunately, are only adequate. The transfer is good, but not great, and there's a paucity of extra features in a series that calls out for them. Unfortunately, if a viewer wants to see The Wire as its creators--David Simon, Ed Burns, Robert Colesbury--intended, these are the discs to get, for the upcoming Blu-Ray HD widescreen version is not a restoration: The Wire was filmed and edited for 4:3 aspect ratio and standard definition playback.",1423008000,,2491,4.9052132701421804
2094047,5,B0002ERXC2,"After the first episode, my husband and I wasn't sure we would like this show, but we knew enough to keep watching.  By the end of the second episode we were hooked.

2094048,5,B0002ERXC2,"Don't start this show unless u have plenty of free time. It's totally addicting and you'll find yourself camped in front of the TV watching every season!!! Most realistic cop show ever made, not even up for debate!!",1422144000,,215,4.684210526315789
2094049,5,B0002ERXC2,Definitely buy each season individually rather than buying the box set. A friend has the box set and the packaging isn't great.

The show lived up to it's hype, may be a little slow for some because it's not full of action but the story is top notch with the writers taking the time to develop what eventually becomes a 5 season show.  Gives insight into the inner city drug culture within a bigger US city was like in the early 2000's and how police had to use new ways to get their guys.

2094147,5,B0002ERXC2,"The Wire is a great depiction of the seedy side of Baltimore Maryland. A rare glimpse into how the drug trade works in the inner city. As you watch you can't help but think, this is how it all goes down. You probably think that, because IT IS. This may not be accurate to a T on how all drug cartels do business but it could be. The actors in The Wire have all gone on to do great things, or are already established in Hollywood. The acting is where The Wire shines. Hell, even some of the baddies are loveable. Sometimes you will find yourself rooting for the Omar, the neighborhood Robin Hood who robs drugs from the dealers and gives them to the poor. Did I mention Omar is a homosexual who walks around the projects with a shotgun? He's just one character who makes this series extremely satisfying and interesting. Give The Wire a try and watch Season 1 and pretty soon you'll find that you can't just watch one episode.",1420329600,,925,4.32183908045977

There is very little dullness, and as you learn and begin to understand the characters,  you can at least see the viewpoint of corrupt or deadbeat cops, scumbag drug dealers and human traffickers.

Watching the erosion off privacy and the growth of drug money in city politics woven into story of sincere law enforcement being mired in a corrupt department all done in a believable manor is refreshing.
Being concerned about the leading characters and there challenges usually means the program has 'salt'.
Baring major changes in writing and directing I'll be watching all available seasons.",1420243200,,618,5.371134020618556

The ""bad guys"" are intricate and well-developed, gaining your respect for even armed robbers, murderers and kingpins.

2094596,5,B0002ERXC2,"I watched this years ago, but just started a rewatch. It's amazing how well this show holds up over the years. It doesn't seem at all campy like some shows do the second time through. It's still just as gritty and real.

You also notice how well thought out the whole story was prior to filming when you watch the second time through. Since you know what happens in the end, and how things play out along the way, you can see a lot of care went into making sure there was continuity throughout the show.

If anything, I like it more the second time.

One of the biggest complaints about The Wire presented in an HD format is that the original look and feel of the show is lost due to image cropping at the top and bottom of the screen to make the originally square image fit on a widescreen TV.

I'm a stickler for that sort of thing. And I watched The Wire on HBO when it came out in it's original format. And I didn't even notice the difference. The show transforms to a 16:9 ratio very well without impacting the artistic quality of the series.

So don't hesitate to watch The Wire presented on Amazon in a widescreen format. The quality is great and you'll enjoy the show just as much (or more) than you did the first time you watched it.",1419292800,,1242,4.223628691983122

2094712,5,B0002ERXC2,I watched this show when it first came out on HBO and I thought it was a solid show. This time watching it has been a lot better now that I know the story line it is easier for me to appreciate all of the subtle references and side jokes. The Wire is an awesome show from the stage direction to the writing to the acting. The downside of the show is that it is an ugly and gritty show which unfortunately shows how ugly our reality actual is. It does a nice job depicting reality and showing how crime escalates and why in short the world is not black nor white.,1418515200,,562,4.026785714285714

2094720,5,B0002ERXC2,"One of the best shows for television ever. A totally different cops and bad guys series, The Wire delves into the politics of both the police and the dope peddlers, and finds each of them pretty dark and ugly. It's not an action show like all the other cop shows, though there is plenty of action in The Wire. The writers and creator of the show put far more attention to the dialog and plot of the show. What comes from the mouths of actors rings true even if I've never been to Baltimore nor with the police or heroin pushers.

Each episode is not independent: season 1 is really one extended show over 13 episodes. It gives the watcher time to learn the personalities of the characters. And there are some incredible characters here: McNulty (or McNutty, according to confidential informant Bubbles) is the lead character of the show (though it is the show itself that is the ""star"") but he is on the screen barely half the time. The criminals (Omar, Stringer, Dee and the boys) are as interesting and multi-dimentional as the ""good guys"". And, ""good"" and ""bad"" are sometimes hard to distinguish, which is much closer to real life than anything you will see on the rest of TV.

The Wire is the best, or at least one of the few great, shows on television, now or in the past.",1418515200,,1277,4.452991452991453

2094766,5,B0002ERXC2,"""Whether one is a cop, a longshoreman, a drug dealer, a politician, a judge or a lawyer, all are ultimately compromised and must contend with whatever institution to which they are committed."" - David Simon, creator of ""The Wire""

""The Wire"" is a bitter pill to swallow for a lot of people.

The atmosphere is bleak and dreary from the drug infested projects to the dusty basement Daniels' team is given to set up shop.  There are no flawless heroes in the police department and even many of the criminals have shades of grey. The ensemble cast is huge (and hugely talented) requiring the viewers to pay close attention to the interwoven narratives and not play with their smartphones while watching.

This is not a show for people who think all cops are trustworthy and competent, all criminals are greedy and evil, and that the War On Drugs is actually working. It's for people who have the stomach to watch a display of poverty, corruption, red tape, violence, addiction, and long hours of police work subverted more often by careerists in the department than by the criminals they investigate.

The only flaw that left me unsatisfied concerned the fate of children in the care of a character who dies; there is no mention of what happened to them.  Then again, that might be the point: not every loose end is tied off when a case is closed.  As Omar Little says ""It's all in the game!""

If you like it dark and gritty but intelligent, challenging, and moving, then this show is for you.",1418083200,,1490,4.617424242424242

I have difficulty with dialogue which drops the 'F' bomb at every opportunity. Why are current TV writers unable to generate engaging, intelligent, and well-crafted stories without a lot of foul language. I can not watch this with my grown daughter; it is too embarrassing and lacking.

Look at the more popular series (Sherlock`, Blue Bloods, etc.). They have compelling stories with little or no profanity. This series is truly HBO-like; they would, I think, produce 'Mary Poppins' with lots of full-frontal nudity scenes and plentiful foul language in order to be 'entertaining'.",1417910400,4,665,5.148148148148148

2094838,5,B0002ERXC2,"Ok, so I know, I know, I missed the series when it first came around, but after recommendations it made my queue, and now I'm finally getting to it...

Wonderful series!

Great writing, fantastic acting, and an all-around great story arc.  If you are ok with the content, which is very mature (drugs, violence), then i recommend this to you.

Note: this is an epic adventure, with a long arc, so it moves at a slow pace.  So, if you are into more action/adventure type of stuff, you may get bored.  However, I say the story, characters, and acting are so good that every minute of the program keeps your attention, and makes you think.

That's all I will say in order to keep those of you not in the know surprised, just understand how strongly I feel about this series, now that I started it.  It's easy to get hooked, even though I know this will take some time to get through.

Do not miss it!",1417651200,,896,4.317365269461078
2094839,5,B0002ERXC2,Good story with excellent  acting.,1417564800,,34,5.8
2094840,5,B0002ERXC2,Best show ever. My only complaint is that they could have showed more actual wires.,1417564800,,83,4.6
2094841,4,B0002ERXC2,"To what extent is this show faithful to the real world? Movie and TV cop shows are overwhelmingly risible PR jobs intended to show cops as capable defenders of citizens assaulted by crimininals. The characters are allowed to trip up sometimes, but in the end they are portrayed as noble mostly men. It's tragic that real life is showing up, daily, the obscenity of (un)reality shows such as ""Cops"", that are allowed to continue. (But I digress.)

It is tragically refreshing to see, for a change, a policing organization full of corrupt, crude, uncouth, stupid and fed up policemen, up and down the ranks, who depend on the tax-paying Citizens' generosity for ther jobs, salaries and pensions. And who don't give a rat's posterior about those Citizens, as they defer to their powerful and wealthy patrons who view the cops as their useful idiots who, gradually, in the course of their policing duties, become just like their targets: brutal, unsparing and vindictive primitives, often destroying the hard work of those who take their jobs seriously. So for that, 5 stars is not enough.

On the other hand I have other concerns:
- the acting is so-so, with some notable exceptions. It's not bad enough to quit watching the show; it does manage to compel one to return at a reluctant frequency. (Disclosure: I'm still in Season 1, and hoping that as the crew comes together in the following Seasons, so will their work.)
- the story unfolds at a pace that is at times too slooooooooow.
- the script is too wordy. Kind of like the early movies at the time they turned ""talkies"". Scripts are supposed to take cues from real conversations, not take down everything verbatim. Add to that...
- the terrible diction. Consider: for the massive majority of viewers the inside language of the Black getto dwellers is a foreign language. Most words and expressions, however, are not too difficult to guess. However(#2), the sloppy diction makes half of the dialogues, at least for this reviewer, unintelligible. That's just too bad. Just for fun I had once rewound one portion several times to try and grasp the exchange word for word. The unexpurgated language doesn't bother me, but I find the insider language much more interesting, informative, revealing and entertaining. If only American actors learned to fake speaking with a semi-opened mouth, but at the same time made themselves understood. Kind of like the British actors most of whom attend real acting schools, like RADA. Bad diction is not only unprofessional, but is does a disservice to the actors uttering those words and undercuts the effort of the writers who, very possibly, like most scribblers, agonize over ever word. Thus the actors are flattening the story, while cutting off a dimension of the character they are playing.
- as a recent victim of police stupidity and brutality, I have noticed that the police are not unlike the criminals they pursue. Only the police can kill, harrass and offend with the blessing of the authorities. (vide the Fergusson, and so many other, cases). This is something that the writers show with an honesty that should inspire our insipid lawmakers to make changes before the US police become the SS of our times. (Yes, that is how the NAZI stormtroopers learned their craft.)
- finally, the production values, from direction, photography, costumes, etc., are good, considering the insane pace that plagues made-for-TV shows.

All in all, the show is a good document for posterity: the USA in the early 21st century.",1417564800,,3511,4.927364864864865

It's a hard hitting, gutsy portrayal of what's going on in our urban areas today and what's been happening for the last sixty years in the black community due to democratic paternalism. A task force of incompetent cops is formed and transformed into a cohesive team utilizing their individual strengths. Throughout season 1, a subplot emerges that demonstrates why and how people like Barak H Obama and Eric Holder move up the ladder in corrupt illegitimate positions of power. Absolute power corrupts absolutely.",1417132800,,706,5.034188034188034

I do not believe that even the grittiest police officers toss out the epithet all the time, in all situations, in front of the public, each other, judges....even the judges were using it.  When writers demonstrate a total lack of creativity (see: the ability to write without having to fall back on swearing), I am not going to waste the time to watch.

There is nothing entertaining about being exposed to depravity, to sociopaths, to incompetence- both individual and bureaucratic- to characters that are often prone to make stupid decisions, and those that display inappropriate behavior. However, it is very useful, now and then, to be reminded that such ""imperfections"" exist in our society, in our social organizations (especially in governmental bureaucracies). This series' primary value-add is to serve as such a reminder, and is worth being exposed to for that reason.",1416009600,,632,5.59375

Well written, and well acted; and it's great to see do many of my favorite actors from other shows all together in this.  There's a lot going on in each episode and a lot of characters to keep up with but it's nicely paced and never dull, you must pay attention though because details will come back from previous episodes, previous seasons even.  It's not something that can be jumped into in the middle it's a continuous story arc to be followed.  Kind of happy I wasn't watching from original air date, by being able to watch in a short time frame I have less time to forget details between episodes.

2095158,1,B0002ERXC2,"I couldn't watch any longer than 10 minutes because the directors , writers and producers treat me like i'm an uneducated, immature doofus as they make , mostly white characters , use the 'F' word sounding forced and ineffectual every single time they talk.  I think the black female officer uses obscene language also.  I have nothing against the most vile of words.  (I love the 'c' word)  But, using them in a forced way in a completely unrealistic way takes all the power of dialogue and drops it in the toilet.  And, the show is bigoted in that mostly white people speak like jerks. When, i first started watching this i could see it had all the potential of being a 'Luther' or a 'Rescue Me' or a 'Breaking Bad' until the people started opening their mouths.  The dialogue is way beyond terrible lousy writing and too much forced acting contrived situations. To each their own but i'm not going to watch anymore of it.",1415318400,,924,4.536144578313253

The slow burn... build up.. character development and character surprises-- this season was perfectly executed cop drama.  The focus on police politics and the way the drug war was handled added a great feeling of authenticity.  As an average schmoe I have no idea how accurate it was, but it felt real-- which is all a guy can ask for.  Amazing series (at least the first season)",1415059200,,478,4.3977272727272725

At first glance it looks like just another crime show but in reality The Wire is about people caught up in the symptoms of misguided politics and dysfunctional communities.

2095263,4,B0002ERXC2,"HBO shows have come a really long way in the past 10 years. The acting in the Wire falls well short of your Game of Thrones, Sopranos, Boardwalk Empire brands we are used to.  However the cast is strong as all the main and secondary actors have made pretty good careers and are pretty familiar faces. The story is good and keeps you watching because the entire season is one story and one case. Some young people might find it very hard to watch as no one these days knows what a pay phone or a pager is and it is from a time before computers were in an inner-city police department. But this is a great throwback for anyone born before 1985 and can appreciate how things were done the hard way because it was the only way back then.",1414368000,,733,4.198581560283688
2095264,5,B0002ERXC2,Watching this all over again because it is one of the best series that I have ever been hooked on.

2095268,5,B0002ERXC2,it is great to see a show that doesn't use mysterious high tech to solve the mystery immediately!  Sometimes I think Star trek is more realistic than CSI- anyway- the Wire is great series.,1414368000,,188,4.529411764705882

And is irony the red herring or not? Is the meaning deep, or deep as a cover for shallow? Is shocking reality, or a shocking distraction? Is everything as it seems? Is it all the straight up truth or irony, is parody there, is intentionally the intention? Is it a cover for a cover up, if so which situation is it really?",1413763200,,641,4.487179487179487

The characters and their conundrums in navigating intersecting systems are still interesting but the pacing can be too slow.  I watched the entire first season of the Wire and will probably leave it there.,1413072000,2,395,4.695652173913044

It is the most unrealistic depiction of the interaction between the African American  community and the criminal justice system that I  have ever seen.

Seasons 3 and 4 also superb.  Season 5, not so much.
Well worth watching .

2095500,5,B0002ERXC2,"The Wire is a masterpiece of writing, acting, filming, and editing.  This dramatic series explores the entanglements of poverty, drugs, crime and political corruption abetted by bureaucratic turf-building, greed and political corruption in a large American city, Baltimore, and can be extrapolated to any other urban area.

Don't watch this if you want an emotional massage to make you feel good.  It's a powerful, realistic portrayal of life and drugs in the ghetto and the slime that exploits and profits from drug money.",1412467200,,523,5.27710843373494

2095505,3,B0002ERXC2,"Baltimore homicide detective Jimmy McNulty gets into hot water and is assigned to a detail of outcasts tasked with investigating drug lord Avon Barksdale and his operation. The plot involves numerous individuals and twists and turns - too many, after awhile.

2095511,4,B0002ERXC2,"A friend of ours called it a ""slow burn,"" which turned out to be accurate.  However, by the second half of season 1, and pretty much all the way through season 4, we were completely addicted.  If you end up watching the whole series, season 1 is almost better the second time around - you pick up on things that were hard to catch the first time when names were flying around like a disturbed hornet's nest.  Not to say I felt cheated or like I was missing anything the first time, but going back a second time ends up shedding new light.
Season 1 is great, season 2 is too, but season 3 is amazing.  Season 4 is also amazing - maybe even my favorite - but it is also really tough, perhaps the most difficult in terms of emotional strife.",1412380800,,738,4.176056338028169

2095603,5,B0002ERXC2,"This show has been called the greatest television series of all time and there is a reason.  This is not your typical cop drama.  It isn't your typical mob show.  It isn't your typical show about politics or blue collar people.  It is a study in sociology.  It is an examination of a large eastern port city rife with drug crime and murder.  The characters are based upon real people and some of those real people actually show up in the series.  This series is more reality television than any housewives, bachelor, fake castaways, or 20 somethings living in an apartment acting like buffoons could ever portray.  Sure, the show is dated by today's standards.  The lack of social media and world view of just after 9/11 shows but much of what you see is relevant today.  The game is the game and that was as true for me 20 years ago as it is today.  Ignore the 1 or 2 star or 3 star votes.  They didn't watch the show or they didn't relate to any portion.  They couldn't get past the grit.  One person complained about the swearing.  Newsflash, people swear... especially the people portrayed in this series.  Check this out for yourself.  Its an amazing expose on inner city life.",1411689600,,1182,4.474178403755869
2095604,5,B0002ERXC2,This was the best series ever produced by HBO so far.  I loved The Sorprano's and am enjoying Game of Thrones but THE WIRE is the best of the lot.  You hate the good guys sometimes and love the bad ones but no matter what you have an emotional response to everyone in the cast.  It is not just a cop show it deals with politcs race relations greed.  It a a whose who of the seven deadly sins aand why they are deadly.

To be brief then, I just watched the first season and I am hooked.  The slower pace makes the viewer pay attention as each character is developed, whether drug dealer or cop, and is revealed as a 3-dimensional person containing some good and some bad.  The Projects, where much of this takes place, can also be seen, in its way, as a complex character of its own.  Excellent entertainment, well worth watching.",1411430400,,567,5.064516129032258

Some people are offended by the profanity used by the charters who sell drugs and murder for a living.  Duh...  Well no  "" Ned Flanders "" here on this show buba-reno.  IMHO this show is nothing short of a modern master piece  There are five seasons.  to get the full impact of the show you must see all five seasons.  Also, and I do not mean to offend anyone; white people are not really the stars of this show.  This can subconsciously skew some peoples perceptions.
Often in movie or TV  discussions with co-workers I find that while I have seen the shows that have little to no blacks in them, my white counterparts rarely can say the same for any show where blacks are in the lead. This is not a put down, just and observation.

 So for those who think Breaking Bad ( Love it great show) is the best show ever; this may not be your cup of tea.  Someone mentioned that they were not "" entertained""  I can understand that.  Depending on your empathy level the show can be somewhat brutal at  times.  Ok hears the deal.  If you are of average intelligence and have an open mind; and watch ALL 5 Season , when  the final curtain drops you will say "" I understand""

You will walk away with understanding that is both profound and disturbing.
This is  the : BEST SHOW IN THE HISTORY OF TV,  BAR none .  Compared to what you say?  The Shield , SOA, Dexter, and yes Breaking Bad.

There is some violence and pornography but focus is on why it is happening. Each episode left me craving for the next.

No disrespect to Mr. Gandolfini or Ms Falco.  Is there a miscast actor in the WIRE?  Is there a story line than makes no sense?
The answer is NO.  Season one lays the groundwork for 4 more brilliant seasons. Now that television has as much artistic respect as the cinema,. I think that The WIRE will rate with television as The GODFATHER 1 & 2 rate with movies.",1410652800,,630,4.598214285714286

It would get 5 stars if the people from the project who played a big role in the series were a bit easier to understand.  Often, their speech patterns were totally not understandable.

2095808,5,B0002ERXC2,"Up until watching The Wire, my favorite police oriented drama had been NYPD Blue, in spite of how loaded it was with anti self defense propaganda.  But The Wire blows any other police drama I've seen out the door.  Ever wonder why Baltimore, with highly restrictive gun laws, could have a murder rate even higher than Chicago, and 6 times the rate in NYC?  Well, The Wire, although fictional, offers some choice examples of how corrupt politicians and their police can allow such situations to thrive.

Yes, it's difficult for some to take the constant ""f"" and ""n"" bombs, but they fit with the overall dramatic content of the show.  After all, the subject is how a police task force goes about getting information to arrest members of a criminal gang selling drugs, and enforcing their will be murder.
Two events stand out spectacularly.  In the first, the main character and his partner go over an old murder scene, and, using their knowledge of how crimes are committed, gradually figure out how the murder occurred.  And they do this without the nonsensical Sherlock Holmes ""brilliant deduction"" nonsense so prevalent in the typical TV and movie dramas supposedly about police activities.  The second event spans the end of one of the latter episodes in the season and the beginning of the next.  I won't give it away, but these are two of THE most gut wrenching TV scenes I've ever seen in my 60+ years.  Again, unlike the other TV series nonsense, the scenes are believable.
These are just two standout events from a series which towers above every other TV cop show, in scene after scene.  If you like police dramas and can get around the language, see this series.  But I have to warn you, there was a downside for me.  After beginning this series, I have little patience for the usual drivel shown on other TV cop shows.",1410393600,,1828,4.675

2095825,5,B0002ERXC2,"I live in Baltimore and for years have heard people talk about The Wire.  Never had HBO or whatever channel it was aired on, but happily recently realized we have access to it for free through Amazon Prime.  As soon as I knew that, I started watching, and then had to binge watch because I was hooked.  It's a little bit dated - as in, I think it was filmed in 2002?  So they use beepers and pay phones.  But I quickly got past that, and found it to be a really excellent drama.  It gripped me and was everything I had heard.  My only criticism is that, obviously, it paints a very bleak picture of Baltimore.  Sadly, it is all TRUE...it just doesn't let an uninformed viewer know that there are equally wonderful and attractive things about the city, and that people other than drug dealers and dirtballs do live here!  It's a view of the seamy underbelly that is painful but like any disaster, you can't take your eyes away.",1410393600,,926,4.337209302325581

I'm involved with two recovery groups where we have lots of people from the streets who come into the programs high or drunk. I don't hear as much profanity from 100 of those people in a week as I did in the first 30 minutes of the pilot.

I watched 1/2 of the pilot but really couldn't get into it because of all of the swearing. I pulled up the next episode to see if the writers came back down to earth but they didn't.

2096072,5,B0002ERXC2,"This is an awesome TV series about the very sad truth about the current urban environment, in a declining economically depressed city. An extremely accurate look at what happens to the inner city and it's people when drugs, corruption, and greed rule the land.

Why is this HBO hit so accurate?  Easy to figure out, the two creators (and earlier episode writers) lived in this world. One was a homicide detective with the BCPD. Who better to write about very real inter-working of drug crimes, gang control of the lives of the people trapped in this world, and the brutal and senseless murders and beatings that go with that territory.

The second creator/writer was a newspaper reporter for the Baltimore Sun. And much to his credit and everlasting value to the community, he was fired by the paper when his stories got a little to close to the truth of the rampant corruption, of all kickbacks, and payoffs to contractors , politicians, and dirty police on the take......  All on the take, .... all part of the problem.  So, instead....  he created a brilliant HBO series to tell the truth, (and make some mega bucks doing it I'm sure)

 .... God bless them both, they give us a very realistic insight into a world that most average Americans never will see or, be exposed to, but maybe we should all be exposed for us see:  This depicts the very real desolation of our inter-cities and what the rampant, the absolute decline of morals and values do to the human beings caught up in the misery,.

This is sometimes not easy to watch, the violence, the stark moral decline of American culture, the hopeless, pathetic fate of those trapped in this insane maze with seemingly no way out is tough to take. But the real world really is sometimes hard to face and after we can face it, maybe we can help change it.

2096075,3,B0002ERXC2,"I know this series was a big hit, but I find it slow and a bit difficult to follow.  The basic story is plain enough; but episode after episode, all I see is good guy spying on bad guy and bad guy figuring out that good guy is watching and shifting tactics to keep good guy at bay.  There is a sub-plot: smart-aleck good cop, smarter than his bosses, keeps annoying bosses and keeps getting into trouble.  After six episodes, I was still looking for something to happen.  Not much ever does....  I'll give you this much, however: it's probably more realistic than a lot of the more flamboyantly violent shows out there.  My guess is that real cop-work is more like this than, say, ""24.""  Another positive (in my book): ""The Wire"" is a lot less centered on gratuitous nudity, using it only sparingly and in context, unlike many HBO offerings which clearly use skin to compensate for poor content and writing.",1408579200,5,907,4.52760736196319

I wasn't surprised but more annoyed with how unwilling the detectives are to get work and how willing they are to push work on someone else. Not only does it portray the destruction of the pushers and users by they're drug of choice it shows the detectives slow demise by they're drug of choice, alcohol and seniority. Sad.

2096149,3,B0002ERXC2,Thought I'd like it and was glad to see it available via Amazon Prime.  The show had good reviews while it aired and I lived in Baltimore so thought I'd be engaged with it.

Thought it was just another exaggerated view of an over done subject in television, the drug trade in the ghetto. I was wrong. This is as real as it gets. Well written and acted.

Every other word was the F word or the MF word.  Why?  Pretty soon that's all I could hear & it became difficult to
even follow the story.  A little of that language is OK for effect, but they took this to a different level.

2096189,5,B0002ERXC2,"There is a reason this show is widely considered one of the best, well written storylines for a dramatic series of all time!!!  It portrays urban crime life realistically and the beaurocratic nature of local (and even federal) governments equally so the dialogue matches suit in that there is a lot of cursing.  For the simple minded, easily offended this show probably isn't for you.  For those that can look past the dialogue and see the complexity of the script and even more complexity of the well developed characters, this show is probably the best overall series ever created and aired.  Don't take my word for it though, spend 10 minutes researching The Wire from reputable websites that critique TV and movies for a living and you will see this is widely considered to be the smartest, deepest, most realistic, and overall best show and series ever created for television!!!",1407801600,,883,4.866666666666666

The writing, acting and directing is superb!  The only reason I can think of why someone would not like it is because it is a little gritty. it is not for kids, but if your looking for a good cop program with more than just pretty faces and the same old storylines, try it, I can't imagine you won't enjoy it.",1407715200,,513,4.13
2096196,5,B0002ERXC2,"Plot and story and characters and such.  What more could you ask for.  I enjoyed it... even after being told by multiple people how it was one of the greater shows on TV (this usually makes me go into it with a closed mind).  Its free with Prime, why not watch it? Right?",1407715200,,271,4.0754716981132075
2096197,5,B0002ERXC2,"Many others have praised The Wire.  I agree with nearly all that has been written, both among professional critics as well as in the Most Helpful reviews on Amazon.  Please refer to them as to why this series is truly among TV's best.  I want to discuss what many of us have wanted from The Wire for a long long time - The Wire finally in wide screen only on Amazon Instant Video.  Both HBO Go and my DVDs are in the 4:3 ratio.  David Simon, the main creator, declared before that he wanted the show to be more rough visually, that the 4:3 ratio suited the grittiness of the series and was a throwback to that era, the 90's and he believed that the show should not be in HD.  While I applauded that thinking there was always that little voice in my head that said, ""Yeah but it would still be great to see the series in a wide screen format.""  My wish was granted.  A few days ago I started watching the 1st episode, The Target, on Amazon and initially thought that the screen had been stretched out to fit my 16:9 screen.  I paused the video, put in my Season 1 disc 1 and was astounded that they hadn't done so.  Details in the background that I had had no idea were present were visible.  To me the quality of the stream is also slightly superior to the DVDs visually.  I think I have never been so happy to find that the DVDs I own are now obsolete.

Here's hoping that HBO may one day release the wide screen version of The Wire...",1407715200,,1436,4.140794223826715

There isn't much exposition or predictable plot devices, which is great. The episodes do not have a tidy arc.

2096262,5,B0002ERXC2,"This series got great reviews for a reason!

After marathon-rewatching Breaking Bad to the bitter end on Netflix last winter, we were left with a deep dark void.  It took a few episodes to warm up, but this filled it.  Fabulous acting, compelling ""true"" storyline, a gritty train wreck that we couldn't turn off.  Sometimes we'd watch (against our better judgment) until 2 am.  Sometimes, we'd dream about it.  That's how good it is.

PS  As a Midwesterner, I struggled to understand the dialog.  My husband, from Chicago, got it all the first time.  It sounds silly in this day and age, but thank goodness for rewind.  And patient husbands!",1407369600,,641,4.736363636363636

The plot, character development and social commentary about inner city and governmental red tape open your eyes to the plight of corruption and crime. I have watched this whole series four times and each time, I am amazed at what I missed or misunderstood previously.  This show deserves your undivided attention as there are many characters and plots intertwining at once.  The writers were former journalists and cops in the Baltimore area, so they bring realistic issues to the viewer.  I wish more shows tackled these issues with this much guts and humanity.  You get a full understanding of why things are the way they are--whether it be drugs, gangs, the shipping industry, schools, and the newspaper.  The good guys aren't always good and the bad guys aren't always bad.

2096520,5,B0002ERXC2,"HBO has a sterling reputation for the series' it has created over the years.  This series does not disappoint.  I'm coming to this series a good while after it was originally broadcast.  Nevertheless, I've grown addicted to it and am actually on the third episode of season four.

This is the best crime series I've ever seen and I've seen a lot of them.  The cast was largely unknown to me.  Some faces seemed familiar to me, character actors mostly, but no names I would have recognized.  No stars.  No matter.  The cast is amazing and the real stars are the writers.
Viewers are introduced to a crew of world weary cops in Baltimore some of whom have bucked the system and paid the price as they battle the city's drug trade. Each of the characters is a fully realized human being with strengths and weaknesses that play out over the course of the series.  Not only are these cops fighting the drug traffic but they're fighting the corruption of their own bosses and the sleazy politicians who control them.
Like most HBO series, this one has a good deal foul language, nudity, sex and violence.  But, I don't see how the series could have been done without it and still kept a grip on the reality of  degradation, despair and dehumanization that occurs in a big city ghetto.
For those of us who are lucky enough to live in the suburbs, this series is an eye opener. The writers, producers and actors who put this show together should be commended for the insight, unblinking honesty and compassion with which they have treated the source material.  This is a truly great series.",1406160000,,1582,4.567375886524823

I've been hearing about this show for years, but never got around to it until recently when I found out that I had access via Amazon Prime. It starts a little slow and I thought it felt too ""TV"" in the pilot episode, but I'm really getting into it now. The characters pull you in and there are lots of subtle metaphors through dialogue and imagery. I wouldn't be surprised if I feel like changing my review to five stars by the end of the season. Hopefully that doesn't come too soon as it feels like it would be easy to go on a binge on a Sunday afternoon.",1406160000,,627,4.105691056910569

2096549,5,B0002ERXC2,"The Wire is clearly one of the most impressive achievements in what we call 'television series'.  Of course, like many others of its kind, we could argue if it really is a television series considering that it is rated R and made for a pay subscription service devoid of advertisers, commercial interruptions and an image of wholesome family values to protect.  But setting aside that, it is so well crafted that I couldn't help but come away from it wondering why most multi-million dollar feature movies aren't this good.  I think that if you like crime dramas The Wire is a must-see.

This is not to say that it is perfect.  I found the overt sexual content, much of it homsexual, to be an unnecessary distraction.  Fortunately, those scenes are brief enough to be forgivable.  At least we can be thankful that blood and gore, while present, isn't as graphic as has become the norm in rated R movies.  It's hard to say how realistic The Wire actually is.  It certainly seems realistic, but without being a veteran police officer in a major city it is hard to say how much of it the producers got right.  My guess is that real police detectives have considerably less freedom than what we see portrayed on The Wire.

We seem to be in a sort of golden age for serial dramas right now.  I think some, like Lost and Fringe are overrated, but The Wire lives up to its hype and is a classic that will continue to be watched decades from now.",1406073600,,1438,4.467432950191571

It seemed too slow-moving to us and we had problems with understanding some of the ghetto/street language of the main characters. This time we hung in there, and it was well worth it. The show tells the  story of a group of Baltimore cops efforts to take down a drug operation. The story is told from both the perspectives of the police and the members of the drug gang. The culture, politics, and management challenges of both groups play major roles in the drama--and these everyday, real-life issues give the characters depth and make the story whole. The Wire, in its gritty, urban style, is television drama at its best.",1405728000,,783,4.5928571428571425

2096651,3,B0002ERXC2,"The Wire:  A TV-show with many well known actors and a plot that takes too long.  The entire series is about an African American gang leader (located in Baltimore, MD) and his crew of loyal yet underprivileged crack slingers who battle the Baltimore P.D. for reigns over their ghetto.  Each season takes a number of dips into unrelated territory as the group of Baltimore detectives attempt, and of course succeed, at thwarting the master plans of the gang leader (Avon Barksdale).  The name ""The Wire"" comes from the fact that they the Police wire tap the criminal body they are pursuing. Overall its an interesting story with a drawn out plot that isn't worth it.  IT DOES NOT GET BETTER...",1405468800,,692,4.733333333333333
2096652,5,B0002ERXC2,"Having attended college in Baltimore around the time this show was being filmed & aired, I can appreciate how real the places and scenes depicted in The Wire are.  Beyond the realism of the backdrop, the characters are real, relateable, flawed, but not idiotic.  Nothing annoys me more than when a a drama moves the plot forward by chronically having characters do idiotic things.  The Wire is the polar opposite of this as the story is moved forward intelligently with very few ""now why the <bleep> would he do that?"" moments.  Once you get through a few episodes, you'll find yourself binge watching the rest to see how the multiple plots intersect over the course of the entire series.",1405468800,,688,4.756302521008403

Money, the search for it and security has ripped our urban,life apart. The drug trade at the bottom and politics, business at the top,are seen as identical.  They are just different kinds of deals but almost all the interactions between people are transactions.  The city functions either as a faux super-ego repressing uncontrolled desires, or as a super-structure repressing the energy directed toward money and power but which could be re-directed toward class conflict.
  ,the actors are simply wonderful.  The plot lines, maybe a little too mechanical are at least cogent and well,constructed.  Hooray for this light on a dark subject.",1405296000,,773,5.185483870967742

2096731,5,B0002ERXC2,"I've read about how good of a show The Wire is for years now, so I decided to give it a try. I was skeptical at the beginning because the first episode felt like just another formulaic cop/crime drama. Fortunately, I persevered and was pleasantly surprised by how well written and well acted this show really is. It was an interesting exploration of the far reaching effects and influence of the drug culture, both criminally and politically, in Baltimore. The characters have a depth to them that I have seen in very few other shows and the primary story line was engaging up until the very end. l would highly recommend this show to anyone seeking a quality program and I am excited to start on season two so I can see how all of the characters evolve.",1405123200,,754,4.471014492753623

2096752,4,B0002ERXC2,"I watched The Wire when it originally aired and have watched episodes from the first season several times.  Now, thanks to Amazon Instant Video, I have been able to binge-watch the entire first season again.  Needless to say, I am a big fan of The Wire and really wanted to give it five stars.  But to be honest, there were a few areas for improvement in the first season that subsequently did get better in future seasons.  The major complaint is the pacing and the payoff.  Yes, The Wire is a slow-moving storm and that is one of its strengths, yet there were times in the first season where the pace really was too slow.  As Detective Freeman said, all the pieces matter, but at the same time, it's tough to know what we're looking at when there is so much to decipher.  As far as the payoff goes, it's slightly annoying that the big payoff for this season really does not occur within the season.  That doesn't mean that this wasn't a first-rate, high quality show - it just means that you have to commit to the entire thing.  I can't judge season one by what happens in season five... so I can only give season one four stars.",1404950400,,1131,4.347619047619047

The Wire has a lot to say about a number of social problems, such as poverty, race, drugs, The Drug War, the legal system, public schools, the press. But The Wire handles these with subtlety and depth, rather than the finger waggling and posturing of Oz. There are not really heroes and villains in this version of Bodymore, Murderland.

One great thing about this show is that every scene whether you are in the ghetto, cop station, or the official of the local politician all feel very real. I can almost smell the scenes.

The plot is thin, and the show apparently believes that the shock value of the f*** word will be enough to draw an audience.

2096901,4,B0002ERXC2,"A bit slow, but definitely worth hanging on for a while.  If you aren't interested after episodes 4 or 5, you probably might want to pass (though my favorite episodes were the latter of the series).  The writing is very well done, though there is a lot of profanity and vulgar language which bothers some people (most of the 1-star reviews are from the elderly and/or the bible-thumpers whining about the cursing). It is an interesting way to tell a story, from the traditional ""good"" and ""bad"" sides, showing how the line of good and evil is actually blurred, rather than focusing on the cops and allowing them to win every time).  Unlike a lot of other crime shows, this follows one story line throughout the 13 episodes, unlike most TV police dramas which have entirely new plots every episode.  This can make the story very slow at times so ignore the people telling you this is ""fast-paced,"" they have read too many review snippets and think it just means ""good."" It is definitely good however, worth the 13 hours.  Finally, it helps if you can understand a lot of street and cop lingo, and if you are willing to re-watch parts that were confusing, the story does get complex at times with numerous different characters going all at once and a lot of call-backs to earlier episodes.

4 stars instead of 5 because although it is excellent, it is a little slow and contains some gratuitous HBO sex and violence. GHBOS+V is the stuff that you know they are throwing in solely because marketing tells them they require X boob shots and Y severed limbs. If I wanted sex and violence, I'd watch porn and play video games.",1404259200,,1620,4.588235294117647

I would never have given the show a try had I not been recovering from surgery (I was nearly bed-ridden and there was nothing else to watch). The name implies that this is a show about drugs and police. But it's so much more. The Wire is about the decline of the large city in America. One season focuses on the War on Drugs, another on our appalling public education system. The news media, the disappearance of jobs and our politicians are the focus of other seasons.

2096967,5,B0002ERXC2,"This was my second time through The Wire (Season 1), and it was even better than my first time through during its original airings on HBO. What makes this a remarkable show is that it feels so authentic and manages to encapsulate the best elements of an excellent police procedural, an in-depth character study, the best gangster films, and all of those ""misfits become a great team"" films. It's also not afraid to slow burn through all of the elements and allow them to cook up to perfection.

I am no fan of hyperbole in reviews, but this is honestly one of the best (if not the best) shows I've ever seen. Mainly because everyone in the show is written so humanly. In a context where clich could so have so easily won the day, especially in terms of race, crime, sex or violence; this show decides to go deeper.

And don't forget to watch for Omar; a character so original, and almost appallingly visceral in his appeal, you wonder why no one ever wrote and executed someone like this character before this show.",1404000000,,1015,4.510869565217392
2096968,5,B0002ERXC2,"The Wire is unique in that it simultaneously creates empathy from the audience for both the cops and the criminals portrayed. Season one focuses on 2001-ish technology and how criminals outsmart it as well as fall prey to it. It is centered around the street trade of heroin on the rough streets of Baltimore (bal-more as they pronounce it in the show). The show is authentic, realistic, and quite gritty. The characters are all flawed individuals, but utterly human. The show un-apologetically portrays racism, so the thin-skinned should be careful. it is not appropriate for children or adults offended by anything racier than PG-13.",1404000000,,635,5.115384615384615

The Wire is an American crime drama television series set and produced in and around Baltimore, Maryland. Created and primarily written by author and former police reporter David Simon, the series was broadcast by the premium cable network HBO in the United States. The Wire premiered on June 2, 2002, and ended on March 9, 2008, comprising 60 episodes over five seasons.

Each season of The Wire introduces a different facet of the city of Baltimore. In chronological order they are: the illegal drug trade, the seaport system, the city government and bureaucracy, the school system, and the print news media. The large cast consists mainly of character actors who are little known for their other roles. Simon has said that despite its presentation as a crime drama, the show is ""really about the American city, and about how we live together. It's about how institutions have an effect on individuals. Whether one is a cop, a longshoreman, a drug dealer, a politician, a judge or a lawyer, all are ultimately compromised and must contend with whatever institution to which they are committed.""",1403913600,2,1174,5.051546391752577

There isn't really a ""whodunnit"" aspect to the show, since the show spends an equal amount of time on both sides of the law. An excellent balance of character development and story-telling, without turning into a soap opera.

2096988,5,B0002ERXC2,"Every good word said about this series is true.  The best television I've ever experienced.  During the last few episodes of Season 5, I was dreading coming to the end.  I will miss these people.

Some things that the makers are clear about:  Not everyone is all-good or all-bad.  For all our good intentions, we don't always do the right thing, and no matter how bad we seem or, indeed, are, we can put others' interests before our own.  Whose code is more honorable, McNultey's or Omar Little's?  Is there even a difference between them?  Are the good guys really good and the bad guys really bad?  If the bad guys are really bad, why are they?

I haven't read all the reviews, but of those I have, one thing not mentioned is how The Wire focuses on the issue of race in America.  If the bad guys are really bad, why?  It's a question we Americans never seem to get around to asking ourselves.  Point fingers, sure we do that.  Excuse ourselves, we do that, too.  Mostly, we get defensive when we might have to acknowledge that our institutions have ignored and left to its own devices a whole segment of society.

Like all great novels, The Wire's conclusion ties everything together.  With scenes like Leandor Sydnor in Judge Phelen's chambers and Duquan Weems in the final montage, we get the feeling that we've been here before, and it makes me cry.",1403827200,,1355,4.506172839506172

2097013,5,B0002ERXC2,"The Wire is utterly outstanding. I'm not a big fan of the theme music, but that's really the only complaint I can come up with. The characters are multi-dimensional and cover a broad sociological spectrum. The plotting is intricate, well-paced and subtle. The dialogue is very well-written, and the no-name actors who are delivering it do as good a job as any cast I've seen.

None of the seasons that follow are quite as good as Season 1. They are all very good, but it's almost like going to a reunion concert for a blockbuster rock group. It's great to have the band back together, but the energy is inevitably different the second time around.

If you've got a spare 13 hours, and are looking to fill it with some high-quality TV from the HBO/Prime catalog, this is definitely the place to start. I'm a big fan of HBO's series, and I really think this is the best one.",1403740800,,872,4.477987421383648

2097028,1,B0002ERXC2,I am so tired of writers substituting continuous profanities for substantive dialogue. I have come to the firm conclusion that only writers with little to say and no imagination need to use profanities every other word. The profanity in this series is abusive and overrides any substantive writing that may be hidden. Enough! I would rather watch The Killing with its plots and twisting subplots because the actors actually say something and don't need to rely on profanity to get their point across.

For whatever reason, I thought it was kind of boring and the overuse of foul language did nothing to spark up the story or characters.

Well, ""Mad Men"" and ""The Wire"" are quite different--so different that I can't figure how someone would enjoy/rate them as (superior) equals.  Maybe ""The Wire"" was unique TV fare for it's time, but as a first time viewer in 2014, I did not find it all that compelling.  After about Episode 5, (Season 1) my interest began to wane.  True, it has gritty realism, and the acting is superior.  But there is not a single character that I am riveted by --with the possible exception of the Lieutenant.  (But he's not in enough scenes in my opinion).  Also, I found it a little hard to follow with just a single viewing of each episode.

Screen-time is split evenly between the cops and the drug dealers.  Both sides have to deal with similar challenges: managing a big group of people that sometimes back-stab each other, adjusting to new technologies, and deciding how to spread the blame around when things go wrong.  I found it interesting that the cartel's juvenile ""hoppers"" acting as lookouts, touts, runners, and entry-level ""product"" handlers were forbidden to get high because it would make them unreliable. . . so in a way, the cartel was keeping at least some kids off drugs!

Cinematography, acting, dialogue and plot are all top-notch.  None of the ""dope fiends"" are the least bit chic or enviable, and it was clear that the dealers had zero respect for their customers.  Some of the cops' immediate bosses are the type that could make their employees eager to get out on the street and be shot at, just to get out of the office.  At the top police administrative levels, it's ""Dilbert"" with guns; any work that gets done is in spite of them rather than because of them.  The cartel's management structure is just as rigidly hierarchical but seems a lot more cohesive, possibly because the alternative is generally a cap in one's a--.

2097089,2,B0002ERXC2,left me cold since premise was an overdone one and writing pretty average at best. I would say acting B- and scripts d+ c- range.,1403395200,,129,4.2
2097090,5,B0002ERXC2,The Wire was one of the Best shows ever on television. The writing was simply excellent. What was surprising to me was the inexperience of some the actors. But those actors were able to hold their own and make the show. It's a Shame that this show never won any awards from the main stream. But the Wire has won the acclaim of the people which I believe matters. If anybody hasn't watched the Wire should just watch an episode and I promise you will be hooked on the show.,1403395200,,472,4.2555555555555555
2097091,3,B0002ERXC2,"I thought this show was OK.  It never really grabbed me, because it was too rough.  The hierarchy within the police force were all trying to stop the newly formed police unit solve the crime.  There were a number of crimes and apparently only one ""good"" cop thought they was worth solving.  He, slowly, converted others to his cause, but never the leaders.  This felt ""wrong"" to me, but may actually be reality in many places.  I did not follow on to watch season 2.",1403308800,,466,4.423529411764706

2097100,4,B0002ERXC2,Pretty good. The language is bad but at least the storyline is good. I hate the fact that every show you watch has to have gay and lesbian in it. And HBO of course has full naked scene but I can move forward through the show. It helps,1403308800,,234,3.8958333333333335
2097101,5,B0002ERXC2,"Amazing show; well-written, compelling storyline, real, gritty, provocative, and controversial. This in-focus look at Baltimore sets the bar high, as far as drama is concerned. Short-lived, but nonetheless exceptional.",1403308800,,218,6.551724137931035

The violence shown is not detailed in detail graphic, which is a good thing. It there but not to the point it make you ill watching it. The story shows the ying and the yang of life and that it is also well portrayed in the individuals too.

2097108,5,B0002ERXC2,"Wasn't expecting the show to be much more than a ghetto thug show. After seeing an interview with one of the past actors I decided to watch an episode....and loved it. The acting was actually acting and not emotionless reading. It is easy to hate and like the same character rooting for them and yet hoping they fail at the same time. Grey is the ruling moral shade because you either do the ""gotting or get got"". Both the ""good"" and ""bad"" guys land in gray leaning towards black but the magic of this series is that you feel for the characters. It also helps that at it's bleakest moment when it's just a depressing show we get a funny or warm moment.

It made me wonder if i didn't grow up how I did if I would have ended up in the constant struggle between doing the right thing and wanting to survive and support my family. We can say no I would never but realistically speaking hunger clouds judgement, so until that moment of hunger comes I do not know what I would do.",1403222400,,975,4.241935483870968

To have the accompanying insights of this series has been a jaw dropping realization of what's actually going on behind the curtain.

But those boys on the docks (2nd season), that's another story. Someone is taking us on a ride of corruption and it looks like we might be visiting every level. My people are in the basement, now let's envision who's on top. I just wonder if HBO is/was willing to point the finger, call um out.

Not only because of the action, drama, and intrigue, but it is based on fact and that appeals to me.

2097143,5,B0002ERXC2,"Season 1 of the wire was absolutely riveting. The urban towers setting is one we see in all of our own cities on some level.
The drug and gang culture is unerringly depicted, but I think what makes the magic alchemy is the dialogue, which is as close
to rap as you can get in daily commication, on the poetic side.  The verbal exchanges by the drug gang and the narcotics/homocide
detectives is cutting edge, and actually requires close concentration at times to absorb the meanings.  Many major themes are explored in this show, including the absurdity at times of both selling drugs and apprehending drug sellers in the criminal justice system.  The system itself is flawed and contradictory at times, as is the reflection of Dee that the gang killings for the sake of money makes no sense.  As in all great and legendary programs, which I believe this show, and particularly season 1 ranks, the characterizations of characters, plot, casting, dialogue and exploration of the absurd is exquisite.",1403049600,,998,4.852941176470588

Above & beyond the guilty pleasure of the wanton violence, The Wire offers an intelligent plot, although, at times, it can be a little difficult to follow; but, I think what I like most about The Wire is that it frequently (at least once an episode) makes me angry or uncomfortable. Whether it's a cop beating on a kid, or a kid strung out on dope, I'm continuously amazed at the moral dilemmas posed in each episode, on both sides of the badge. A definite recommend if you're a fan of crime drama.",1403049600,,665,4.55

It is difficult to write a full review as I just started watching and I don't binge on a show like this one.

2097200,2,B0002ERXC2,"Thought this might be something new to see. I only watched one show and it only goes along with most of TV today, the more vulgar and violence the better.
My best guess would be that this was written for the 13 to 30 crowd.",1402790400,,223,3.977777777777778
2097201,4,B0002ERXC2,"I binge watched all 5 seasons in the last two weeks, so that might say something. The first season is easily the best out of all of them. I would give it five stars. The characters are great. The story moves along. The writing is crisp and tight. The second season starts to get sloppy. It isn't about being complex or not. It just feels like so much of the story was unresolved and never really made it out of earlier draft stages. That theme carries through the rest of the show. However, the original characters and the relationships among them keep you going through the whole show. The new characters that enter the picture, and sometime replace the old ones (I won't say which) are never as interesting as the originals in the way West Wing continued to add great characters through at least four seasons. They are either devoid of personality or they seem a bit of caricature.

Never expect the sweeping positivism of a show like West Wing. This is a gritty drama and it takes you into the crap of society, and not in just the drug ridden streets at that. It shows you the scum at the highest levels. This show is definitely not black hats and white hats. Good guys are flawed and do some bad things, and the bad guys have some redeeming values and do some honorable things. There is a lot of gray.  It is the interweaving of characters (mostly original), personalities and situations that does get you hooked. All i all, it's life and more real than any ""reality show.""

It can get confusing, as there are a lot of chacters to keep track of. I frequently referred to wiki episodes guides to look up look up characters. If you are googling characters, use episode guides because otherwise you see many big spoilers (this one gets killed, this one survives, these two break up, these two get together, whatever).

The one thing that this show is, unfortunately, is very truthful. I have worked closely with all the types of people in this show (cops, journalists, politicians, community leaders and educators). The depiction of of how much greed, unsavory politics and personal agendas constantly overcome true achievement is all too real. And like real life, it is often the ones looking out only for themselves are the ones who win in the beginning, middle and end. But not always. Some of them lose. At the same time, as the show reveals, changing the system will not be easy, as the system is entrenched and there are so many moving pieces, one can't possibly hope to change the whole system.

You will get 'hooked' just like an addict on the great 'product"" they are selling. You will know you saw a great show. You will be driven to find out what happens to characters. You just might not always feel great about it, just like the cops don't always don't feel great about their work. But like the cops, you will have those great moments where you can only relish loudly among friends in Irish pub or quietly in parking lot chucking empty beer cans up on a roof. Or quietly, where the whole messed up world might not see it or value it, but you know you did the right thing.

Plan on losing the next few weeks once you start watching.",1402790400,2,3145,4.499124343257443

2097203,4,B0002ERXC2,"I write as a retired police officer from the UK, who has now escaped to Atlanta. The Wire clearly expresses the soul wearying difficulties of policing rules where different interests control from different political perspectives. Without doubt, those are different in the UK, but some of the same aggravations, lack of resources, clear direction and judicial wariness are present. As it is on prime, I have been binge watching-for me, that's one show a night, and for me it leaves the impression that the whole of Baltimore City and perhaps all of America's cities are as portrayed in The Wire-which is depressing.

The show is a class act. Well written, acted and directed, just leaves *me* on a bit of a downer. I like a little slush in my pie:) Excellent stuff.

This series has so many characters - many going by nicknames - that it was hard to follow. There are so many back-stories to each character that are alluded to but not clarified, so it left these viewers confused, unsure of where the plot was going. I was ready to give up but didn't and by Episode 7, it all started to make sense. Some of the dialogue is hard to understand if you don't live in the inner-city and hang out with drug dealers so we missed a lot - may have to watch it again.

The lanaguage may be shocking to some viewers but it seems to be part of characterization rather than for sensational effect.

2097250,5,B0002ERXC2,"Just a few days ago, I joined the growing club of people who claim that The Wire is the best television series they've ever seen. ""Great,"" you might think if you've never seen it before. ""Another yahoo who thinks this stupid show is the greatest production ever made. How could it possibly be that good? It's probably just hugely overrated like Citizen Kane or The Arcade Fire."" The show Family Guy even worked in a good jab about people get literally brainwashed into thinking The Wire and Breaking Bad are the greatest shows ever. Can it really live up to that level of hype?

Well, I finished the series for the first time this week, and all I can say is that it truly does. I've seen a number of great shows in the past, but The Wire has accomplished things that I've never seen done before, and it commits to them with a level of quality that is unparalleled. With all of the reviews out there crowing praises for The Wire, what more can I possibly add? Well, I'll just jot down a brief list of what I think differentiates this show from any other, and maybe it'll convince you to take your first step like I did last year.

SPRAWLING CAST OF CHARACTERS: There are a ton of characters in The Wire from all walks of life, so many that it can at times be difficult to keep track of them all. (The only other show I can think of to feature such a large number of characters is Game of Thrones, but I haven't watched that yet, so I can't make a proper comparison). There are police officers, police bosses, homicide detectives, judges, lawyers, politicians, longshoremen, elementary school students, teachers, drug dealers, junkies, thieves, and newspaper staffers. More than that, almost every character has a full and developed story of their own, and you'll want to know what happens to each and every one of them. (I promise.)

REALISM: One of the many things that bug me about primetime TV programming is how black-and-white a lot of shows make everything out to be. The good guys, while sometimes flawed, are the good guys, and the bad guys are all bad. In The Wire, these moral lines are frequently blurred. Police officers and politicians often make decisions to save or advance their careers at the expense of others, and many drug dealers and junkies featured seem to be an inevitable product of their crumbling infrastructure, driven to commit crime because it seems like there's no other viable option.

Even more than that, it seems to me that mainstream shows like CSI or NCIS depict a crime force that seemingly has access to unlimited funds to run whatever tests they want in an insanely short period of time; they also have no problem pursuing leads or getting the appropriate paperwork signed because, of course, the agent in question knows best and must have whatever resources he/she needs to crack the case. In The Wire, it's hard to tell what the greater villain is, drug kingpins like Avon Barksdale and Marlo Stanfield or budgetary constraints. In Baltimore, there isn't enough money to go around, so high-tech or creative projects necessary to catch the high-ranking bad guys often get axed. In addition, criminal pursuits can be ignored or manipulated to serve the needs of the government. I've never seen a mayor tell Gus Grissom not to follow a lead because it'll nuke Las Vegas' crime stats and upset the voters.

Lastly on this subject, The Wire is straight with you about life. Sometimes the good guys fail, and sometimes the criminals get away with it. Sometimes life is good to you; sometimes it is mercilessly cruel. With The Wire, you never once feel like you're being pandered to or given a happy fantasy realm where justice is always served fairly, the government and its attached entities always try to protect your best personal interests, hard work is always rewarded with success, and unicorns frolic in the meadows with leprechauns and hippogriffs. I understand that some people don't care for such an honest and occasionally brutal look at life, but I do, and a lot of other people do as well. I also don't like being lectured by my fiction in a heavy-handed manner, and while The Wire has some pretty strong ideas about a bunch of things, I never feel like any of it is being forced down my throat. It isn't concerned with simplistic moral platitudes; it just wants you to realize that not everything in life is as simple as we often make it out to be.

THE ""VISUAL NOVEL"": David Simon, co-creator of The Wire, has often called his show a ""visual novel."" In this, he typically means that, like the chapters in a written novel, everything that happens slowly unfolds and feeds into later episodes. This runs contrary to mainstream television where, for the most part, every single episode wraps its central plot up in a nice, tidy bow with no unanswered questions (save for ongoing series arcs about a mysterious serial killer or a mole in the department or whatever). This makes for a complex and challenging show which actually drives the viewer to really think hard about what it is that they're watching, a show with no simple answers.

Not only that, but The Wire is similar to a novel in that, at times, it seems as though ongoing themes are almost more important than the characters themselves: big, profound themes like urban decay, corruption of authority, the struggles of the American underclass, the efficacy of drug prohibition, institutional dysfunction, the downside of unlimited capitalism, and the many, many battles that individuals wage with themselves and others on a daily basis. The Wire is, essential, the Great American Novel come to life, something I've never seen done on TV. It may not ever be done again, either.

SHEER QUALITY: This, at the end of it all, is probably the biggest aspect that kept me watching and loving what I saw through all 5 seasons. The dialogue, for instance, is golden. Each episode has at least 10 great lines to savor, including those that serve as the opening quotation of that episode (""Come at the king, you best not miss,"" for example - mouth-wateringly wonderful and infinitely quotable). The acting is brilliant, believable, and nuanced; I can't even name anybody as ""the best"" because everyone brings their A-game on this one. And the plot itself is fresh and engaging, often defying expectations and refusing to trot out tired, clichd story developments. Altogether, I'm seriously shocked that a series this good and groundbreaking exists as perfectly as it does. So very little of anything filmed, either TV or cinema, can go very far before network executives demand that the material be dumbed-down or simplified in order to make it more palatable to the American masses. The Wire's existence solidifies the notion in my mind that HBO is the premiere place for quality TV; AMC has really been catching up lately, but as much as I loved Breaking Bad (and anyone who asks me knows that I do), I feel like the The Wire is ultimately a better and more important show.

End of list.

Wow. That's a lot to say about a TV show in a mere Amazon review, and if nobody's reading this little summary, I wouldn't blame them for skipping out. Still, I've got to say all this in the hopes of attracting more potential viewers of the show. The more people shell out for DVD sets and/or subscription service (they offer all their shows to subscribers for free on demand, folks!), the more likely HBO will continue to put out this caliber of TV programming in the years to come. Not only that, it's just an amazing show, one that will forever change the way you look at what the medium of television can do. If I can get even one more person to watch it, I will have probably done them a immeasurable favor of which the dividends are many. So get to it, folks! Vote with your wallets and join the club!",1402444800,4,7794,4.682481751824818

Empire Boardwalk is  a much better well-developed show. Remembering, though, that my eye is extremely demanding and specific, my ambivalence toward ""The Wire"" is not the asis for others' opinions. For example, I dislike the predictability of detective movies, of soap opera style shows while others love them. My favorite movies are ""The Usual Suspects,"" ""The Proposal,"" ""Nobody's Fool,"" ""The Sting.""

I suppose, I was operating under the ignorant theory that if everyone really, really liked this series, it probably was overrated by an audience much less ""sophiscated"" than I.

The main investigation is effectively led by two rogue cops who do not care where their investigation leads, while the police management desperately try to contain the fallout from information turned up on the ruling elite of Baltimore. We meet junkies, strippers, and other denizens of the streets and see the heroes inside them struggling to get out, and we meet one of the scariest predators of the city - Omar, who steals exclusively from the drug dealers themselves.

2097339,5,B0002ERXC2,"The Wire is an American classic. I cannot attest to the accuracy of its portrayal of the drug culture and law enforcement. Fortunately for me I cannot attest to it. However, it rings painfully true. Set in the recent past in Baltimore, the miniseries format allows for rich character development so that there are no unambiguously heroic portrayals and few characters who stimulate no sympathy. The long format also allows the concurrent exploration of multiple plot lines.
Adding to the realism, more than half of the cast are African-Americans, there is no background music of rising strings to tell you when the plot is thickening and a moment of tension is approaching. The plot and the performances take care of that quite well. The Wire is an outstanding series in every way and should be seen for the excellence that it is.",1402099200,,830,4.852112676056338

The characters are well-developed and realistic. The story keeps expanding and turning corners - it's fascinating. If you enjoy good crime stories, you will enjoy this one. The producer is David Simon, the man behind the TV series Homicide. I've read his books and watched Homicide faithfully. Everything he's done has been good.",1402099200,,497,4.724137931034483

From beginning to end it tackles important social issues with a hefty dose of reality thrown in.  Watching the entire series is an exercise in elation and frustration you just can't help but get involved with the characters, the story line, and the social issues that are not resolved.

The plots give the average American a glimpse into challenges that law enforcement officers face, and real issues that exist in the day to day life of people in drug infested neighborhoods.  This is an intense drama that keeps you engaged from the opening scene to the final episode of season one.

That female cop scene in the first 15 minutes is so funny....its painful to think this was taken seriously.  Sorry, but save yourself some time and stay away from this really bad series.

Once you realize it's a bit more in tune with actual police work and not everyone can simply get a warrant at the drop of a hat, it's kind of refreshing to see for a crime drama. Also seeing it a decade after it came out, it doesn't seem to age nearly as well as say the Sopranos or anything. But I guess that's the point.

The difficulty of breaking the syndrome is clearly seen as one generation steps down, (through attrition or jail or death) there is another set to fall in right behind.  The cops not always making the best plays is pretty true to form but the part McNulty plays is fairly believable. There is crime everywhere just waiting to be found out.",1401926400,,469,4.517647058823529

Is this some snobby critics scam to make it so classics along the lines of  Hangin With Mr. Cooper will be looked down upon?  Wonder no more. The Wire is amazing. A group of friends and I were talking about what we are watching.  I was the only one who had watched the Wire at that time.

The question came up ""If you only had a month to live, and you were bedridden, awake and alone for 40 hours what show would you binge watch.""  My answer is simple, Sister Wives, because it would seem like the month lasted 20 years and I would feel like I cheated death.  Back to the Wire, though.  There is a lot of debate about whether this is the Golden Age of TV. I think it is, the Sopranos, Breaking Bad, Justified, Mad Men, Kurt Sutter retelling Hamlet from the viewpoint of a motorcycle gang in Sons Of Anarchy.  The Shield.  Treme. Fargo. If you believe this is the golden age of television, then consider the Wire the Gold Standard of the Golden Age.

I don't know how many people have seen the Wire.  Probably less than tuned into this week's episode of the Bachelorette.  Even fewer have seen the entire Series. ( Quick Take_ Many slag off Season Two Of the Wire. Ignore them.  It may be out of context but when  you view it for what it is it may be the best season, not the worst. ) Many people who have watched the entire Wire series act as though they are part of a special club having watched the Wire.  Although they are morons they are right.  Those who have watched the entire Wire series have seen the best television show in history.

I still feel sad for Baltimore.",1401840000,3,1693,4.28391167192429

I've only seen four episodes so far. It's got my attention, but it lacks the human interest of the Sopranos. Also, The Wire is too focused on one idea, one theme: get Barksdale. The Sopranos had many characters and situations that made each show a new experience.",1401840000,,420,4.467532467532467

My only ""complaint"" is that Closed Captioning is not available, as it was when it originally aired on HBO. This is one series where it would be very helpful for, at least, a first time viewer.

While I am reminded often of how old this show is (beepers and pay phones... who uses those anymore??) the drama is still gripping and the outdated technology takes nothing away from the storyline. I was hooked instantly on the characters' plights on both sides of the law. The only problem is, I don't want to blow through the whole series quickly. Quality shows like this don't come around too often and I'll be left with the usual garbage to sift through once I've watched all five seasons of The Wire.",1401753600,,616,4.412280701754386

The thing is, I didn't really think much of it the first time I saw it. I am convinced that this is one of those shows whose popularity exploded on DVDs because you have to see the whole thing (or at least all of the first couple of seasons) before you can start to appreciate it and realize this is not  just another formulaic police drama. What distinguishes ""The Wire"" is intense realism, lack of pandering to the audience and sociological examination of every aspect of a cities crime problem. It is clearly a show written with an ambitious artistic purpose (a purpose that in my opinion is mostly successfully achieved): To try to portray many different aspects of an American city and how the different institutions and people within those institutions interact with each other and why this often leads to things not getting better. It manages to do all this while giving due space for character development and creating some very compelling entertainment. I think this is the essential American TV show that anyone seeking to understand something about inner cities, the illegal drug trade and institutional urban politics in the 21st century needs to watch.",1401753600,,1304,4.719298245614035

So far, I've glided through the first series, and have embarked on the second (thanks to amazon prime video)...  It is a damn good show so far, well worth watching...  However, I've yet been convinced that it is better than the three I listed earlier...

The first season storyline and characters are complex, yet easy enough to follow...  Characters, no matter how evil or good, are very well rounded and developed...  Bad guys aren't just bad, and good guys aren't saints... This gives depth to every story that unfolds...

The second season seems to be a bit of a reset, I'm interested to see how it goes...  However, the change is so abrupt that I'm not compelled to watch it with any urgency...

What I like best about this show is it is real.  The characters act like normal human beings, with all their virtues and all their flaws.  The reality that transpires is very random, which sets this show apart from the predictable shows.  The chain of command, the unwritten rules, the realistic city politics, the greed, the egos, the friendships, the sex, it all is down to earth, believable, and makes this drama interesting.",1401667200,,899,4.616352201257862

I found ""The Wire"" to be boring with cardboard stereotyped characters and little depth. Perhaps I didn't watch enough episodes but I thought it was just plain dumb dumb. Is this really the best HBO - supposedly premium TV - can do?",1401494400,,319,4.5964912280701755

2097488,5,B0002ERXC2,"Here is why The Wire is better than any other show ever: David Simon is able to get you to simultaneously love and despise almost every character on the show at different times.  Over a season, you both root for and root against almost everybody.  Characters are genuinely human, just like the people in our daily lives, as opposed to being contrived, unrealistic, and paper-doll cutouts like on other ""Good"" shows like Breaking Bad or Mad Men or Game of Thrones.

Simon also creates a flow from episode to episode that is thoroughly satisfying, with a true story-arch within each episode but also wonderfully setting up the reason to watch the next one.  Contrast that with the consistently over abused Flashback and Cliffhanger-per-episode formula that Breaking Bad or Game of Thrones exhaust you with....that's lazy writing and producing.

The Wire was also brilliantly cast and ensemble-acted, as evidenced by the fact that it had no superstars and nobody has gone on from the show to be a superstar.  That's called balance.  I wish Hollywood got that...you don't need to create superheroes or super villains for us, guys.  You don't need to create characters around which the rest of the characters revolve like a Sun.  In The Wire, we're as delighted to focus on Bubs as we are McNulty or Daniels.

While I have enjoyed Simon's other shows as well, nothing has quite been as good as The Wire.  Seasons One and Three, in particular.

Thank you, David.",1401494400,2,1456,4.850202429149798

2097492,5,B0002ERXC2,"Once again HBO has excelled in it's depiction of urban america on a local scale. The Wire joins the ranks of The Sopranos, Deadwood, Breaking Bad and Newsroom for being some of the best viewing entertainment ever produced. From moment one I was spellbound with the storyline, characters and real life drama and watch it like a serial movie. For a lifelong movie fan, these
made for tv series go way beyond what a movie can do. Instead of getting two to three hours of great entertainment, you get a weeks worth or more. Can't say enough good things about HBO and ""the Wire"". Highly recommend it.",1401494400,,595,4.570093457943925

2097494,5,B0002ERXC2,"The actors do a great job.  It is an intense show that goes into great depth to show the potential problems that police have in working in poorer neighborhoods where many of the residents are involved in drugs or other illegal activities.  It is definitely not a show that would be appropriate for children under the age of 16. The basic premise of the show is the effort a few police officers put forth to bring down a top drug lord in a major city.  The drug lord controls whole neighborhoods, but is smart enough to make certain he is not directly involved in most of the illegal activities.  The show also has scenes where you get to see how the pressures of police work impact the families of the officers involved.  The show probably overplays the impact that politics have on everyday police work.  The show is not for everyone, but it is extremely well done and gets into details of police work that a lot of other crime shows don't. It also probably does a better job showing that good police work takes time and patience and that sometimes things don't work out the way you hope they would.",1401494400,,1100,4.447761194029851

Although it has been over 15 years since I last watched.  I found it as engaging as I did the first time,  plus the storyline is still current and far from being outdated.

Police, Unions, Teachers, Politicians, and Newspapers all play a part in the organism, each providing it's own pluses and minuses.

2097547,5,B0002ERXC2,"The weird thing about The Wire, especially this first season, that one might not expect from the not undeserved but yet often breathless reviews, is that it is both funny, fast-paced, and entertaining, even while being important in all the ways the critics rightly wax over. One finds needed moments of humor throughout, in every setting and subgroup examined, that provide key moments of levity when we can't help but find ourselves struggling with the weighty issues the show pieces through: Race, poverty, the African American struggle, blood friendship, etc. (Omar, one of the show's best & most original characters, plays a large-than-life role in that provision.)  And yes, the action honchos amongst us will also find lots things to love here: After all, the show's premise fundamentally deals with bloody drug conflicts between gang members, and the Baltimore ""po-lice"" we get to know and love, and whose mission is to topple a key protagonist's burgeoning empire, are nothing but willing to crack a few heads.  And finally, when our hearts yearn for something softer, we find no shortage of endearing moments as well: My favorite examples are two detectives' brotherly friendship, one which surpasses the bounds of race, as well as other key mentorships between uncle and cousin, boss and soldier, brother and not-quite-kin. All in all, one might say David Simon managed to do the impossible here: Provide a little something for everyone, while never straying towards the trite thus unmoving nonsense one so often finds in run-of-the-mill police procedurals.

There where a few good episodes but the acting wasn't all that believable by some of the cops or the story really didn't pull me in. Then you have the main character  that reminded me of Mark Wahlberg that I didn't care for either. I was more interested in the scenes with the drug pushers than the cops. I did like Idris in his role. Lance Reddick as the Lt was pretty good

I guess it was just a bit of a let down after hearing it ranked up there with The Shield as far as cop dramas. I've started on Season 2 and so far I don't really care for it either. I'm hoping it hits its stride mid/late in the season and turns it up by Season 3.",1401235200,,797,3.9074074074074074

2097622,5,B0002ERXC2,"The 2002 series The Wire, from the outside, didn't have anything the ""normal"" television cop show used.  It wasn't set in Los Angeles nor was it New York.  The Wire was set in Baltimore, Maryland.  Baltimore for Pete's sake!

After one viewing most viewers, I believe, were ready to come back for the second episode.  Not only were they ready, they were likely rather anxious.  English born Dominic West plays a convincing native B'more Detective Jimmy McNulty.  McNulty verges constantly on the ""has been/gonna get in"" serious trouble to savant policeman.  He drinks, he messes around with other women, he is constantly at odds with his superiors and he always seems to have a way of getting things done.  That ""way"" is his redemption.

S1E1 starts out with drug dealer D'Angelo Barksdale (Lawrence Gilliard Jr.) being acquitted of three murders.  McNulty KNOWS Barksdale is guilty but witnesses being intimidated to recant their testimony changes the game.  The judge, a long time friend of Jimmy's from his lawyer days, (Peter Gerety as Judge Daniel Phelen) knows Barksdale's guilty as well and is more than willing to help McNulty get a wire set up on the drug dealing murderers.

The team is set up with Lt Cedric Daniels (Lance Riddick), lead detective Detective Shekima ""Kima"" Greggs (Sonja Sohn), Detective Ellis Carver (Seth Gilliam), and Detective Thomas ""Herc"" Hauk (Domenick Lombardozzi).

Every character has a story -- from the cops to the criminals to the crooked politicians -- that puts them on a collision course in Season 1.

It presents the perspective of children growing up in the ruins of our failed attempts at public housing and public warehousing (uhm i mean education). Uneducated, no skills, no future we are then somehow surprised when the children turn to drugs and gangs. Prisons are the finishing schools for this segment of our society. And the police who try to cope with the fallout. The sense of frustration, the corruption and the total lack of anything resembling a plan come across loud and clear. Note that many local people played as actors and extras in the production.

I've worked on the construction portion of attempting to renovate a few public housing sites and this story condenses many things which i have personally seen and experienced. This is a very sad unhappy part of America which most of us would prefer to make believe doesn't exist. But it does exist.

2097650,5,B0002ERXC2,"My husband turned on ep 1 of The Wire a few years ago when DirecTV ran it on their station. I sat down and thought I'd check it out. At first I was really turned off by the language- it was excessive. But then as I got into it more, I realized it was there because it was real. This is written by a guy who rode with the Baltimore PD and saw this stuff. Some of these characters are based on real people. Some of these things really happened! This series really pulls you in though and you find yourself caring for the drug dealers- the ones you think will be the ""bad guys"". You get to see how, even in drugs, there is a ""code of ethics"". Each season deals with a different theme- the corners, the docks, the schools, the media- and all connected with the drugs, the police, the politicians. And the opening scene of each season gives a general overview of the whole season, but you don't know what they're telling you at the time. We would save the first episode and rewatch the first scene after the season was over. Anyway, AMAZING SERIES!!!!! And I think even that word doesn't give it justice!

Oh, and the cast is INCREDIBLE!!!!!! And they're everywhere now!!! I find myself saying regularly, ""Hey! That's the guy/girl from The Wire!"".

2097653,5,B0002ERXC2,"This is the best show to ever air imo... equaled only by The Shield. The storyline is so true and accurate to the real world that I often had to remind myself that it is in my past and not present as it raised terrible memories of my own from when I was in that world myself. This show gives you a view from all sides of the workings of a big city like Baltimore and you'll understand just how bad it is and how it got to be that way. This show gives a all access pass to the view of everyone and also how everyone is tied together... from the strung out addict living on the street, to the low level pushers, the top of the deck, the blue collared workers who although they have nothing to do with it hands on are still a major part of it all, to the preachers, politicians, and everyone in between. Each season gives a different view of the same city and how it all ties together. You'll likely be super upset when it ends as many of us were.... and what is worst is unless you have seen The Shield nothing will ever come close. I love the Supranos, Sons of Anarchy, Deadwood, Vikings, Oz, Boardwalk Empire, The Borgias, and although each is great in their own ways none of them come close to this one..., except The Shield.
 I cannot give enough praise to the actors. One of which it turns out was so good because she was not just an actor but also a real life participant! ""that's how we do it in ""B"" town"" (a hint of whom I speak of to those who've seen it).
 I could go on and on about why you should see it and ramble about what makes it so right but none of my words will ever do it proper justice until you sit and watch it yourself. Like real life it isn't always action or drama or anything else.. but a mixture of all of it.. some days more of one trait than another... and that is how this show is. Give it time to set up and you'll be thankful you have the ability to watch the next episode as soon as you wish and not have to wait a whole week for the next episode to air like we did when it first was broadcast lol.

Told from various perspectives simultaneously, this seemingly simple story-arc provides real depth to each perspective. For those not accustomed to urban-ghetto dialects, some of the dialog can be difficult to understand at first, but familiarity grows with each episode. Some complain of a slow pace, but I agree with those who point out that this show flows at a more 'real world' speed, complete with complexities, distractions, shifting priorities, etc. And while not awash in flashy 'chase' scenes, it does have it's fair share of blood and gore, as the story requires.

Easily one of the finest US-crime series ever made, never trite or comic-book-simple, never preachy - all sides are shown, flaws and strengths.",1399593600,,745,5.2

2097664,5,B0002ERXC2,"I don't know where to begin-the plot, the acting, everything about The Wire is beyond amazing.  I kept having to remind myself these were just actors and not real people.  The story and characters work their way into your brain in such a way you feel you know and understand them.  The method of storytelling, where you have the perspective of both police and wrongdoers and those caught in the middle converging, sometimes violently, leads to a profound understanding of the social conditions of poor drug-plagued neighborhoods and what motivates everyone involved in the dynamic.  Perhaps nothing I've ever seen before has led me to question the seeming futility of the 'war on drugs' like this program.

I almost can't believe every actor out of this program hasn't hit the big time, though I'm happy at least a few (Idris Elba, Michael B Jordan) have continued to rise in their profession.",1397260800,,893,4.887417218543046
2097665,5,B0002ERXC2,"This is easily one of the best written police dramas of the modern era.  Groundbreaking writing combined with stellar performances from the cast come together to give us a modern classic.  When The Wire originally aired on HBO, I was unable to watch it for various reasons, and had always wanted to.  I recently was finally able to start my Amazon Prime subscription, and this was my first purchase.  I know the show had a strong following and I am a fan that is very late to the party, but I was instantly hooked.  Without a doubt, I will purchase the other seasons as soon as I can.  I already have season two queued up.  It is a fantastic budget for the price.

The thing that makes the writing so good is the realism.  I grew up with a police officer father, and went on to work at the department myself.  My father is long retired, and I am now as well.  It is clearly obvious to anyone that has lived inside the culture that one of the writers was someone who experienced it from the inside.  (Do your research, I do not want to clutter my review with too much detail!)  The nuances the people behind the badge struggle through life with, the various stress and how they deal (or don't deal) with it, the day to day battles, the way the job becomes a political game as you get higher up the chain of command - it's all there.  Beyond the stark realism, it is just plain well done.  Beyond the details about life as within the police force, the street life of Baltimore is captured perfectly.  They had input from people who lived the life and did their research.  Every facet of life is captured in great detail.  Excellent writing that is very entertaining.

Coupled with the top-notch writing is the acting.  Across the board the performances were incredible.  You have since seen many of the cast go on to do other highly lauded roles, many of them in future HBO shows.  I cannot really single out one actor.  Seriously.  In my opinion a lot of this is the writing.  In my experience, as long as the actor has skill, it is hard to make good writing bad.  Writing this good is quite frankly hard to screw up.  HBO is not one to scrimp money, so you know they got top tier talent.  Good talent and good writing is a guaranteed home run almost every time.

If you like gritty, realistic drama, especially police crime drama, this is a must see.  No spoilers here, I will just say - after season one, I cannot wait to see the rest of the show.  Five stars out of five.",1397088000,3,2473,4.310869565217391
2097666,5,B0002ERXC2,I bought this season as a gift for my husband and he loves it. He found the second season used here in town and went ahead and bought it and he never does that so I know it's a good show. Delivery was fast and price was excellent.,1397088000,,230,3.8125

2097674,5,B0002ERXC2,"One of the few DVD sets that I own. Hands down the best effort ever put forth on the medium of television. The first season could stand alone as a great novel brought to the small screen, but you will be hooked and watch the entire five season series. The first season deals primarily with a drug dealing organization in Baltimore and a police unit which is tasked to investigate said drug dealers, however, the length of the series allows the in depth exploration of the criminal justice/court system, the politicians, the municipal education institutions, and the newspapers that cover it all - set against the backdrop of a decaying, although sometimes gentrifying Baltimore. Every police officer, criminal, politician, bureaucrat, newspaperman, judge, attorney, or student will appreciate the absolute truths and realism presented in this series...and you'll have to watch at least three times to see everything. Great characters and acting, unbelievably accurate dialogue, and attention grabbing plot arcs that will make the viewer binge watch to the exclusion of personal hygiene...yeah - it's that good.",1395705600,2,1110,5.3125

The intelligent strategy, unquestioning loyalty, and odd show of humanity from the ""villains"" is confusingly compelling... I actually ended up liking Avon, Stringer, and Omar more than the self absorbed or politically obsessed ""heroes"". I will most definitely purchase all the seasons when I have the opportunity.
My only criticism is with the price of the show. I found the Season 1 DVD set at Target for $17.99; digital media should be significantly less expensive than the hardcopy. The pricing may be set by HBO though, as it seems consistently overpriced across all digital platforms.

The plot can move a little slow at times but the show is watched more for the character development than the  overall story.  The show also provides a good example of the life and times felt by a variety of people in a city where crime and drug use is rampant.

I looked forward to sitting and watching at least one episode a night. This is best viewed if you can watch without having to take more than two or three days between episodes (you won't want to anyway) as the story is complex.

Cops v cops, dealers v dealers. everybody getting squeezed from those on top and those on the bottom. No honor among thieves, as everyone knows, But by watching this series I found out that there's no honor among anybody.

Which is definitely bleak.

However, at the series finale, when our idealistic, street-smart hero gets his comeuppance from higher-ups, it's not tragic, but it feels like a splash in the face with a bucket of cold water.

I remember hearing excellent reviews when The Wire was first broadcast on HBO and decided to start viewing from the beginning.

I will admit that I was somewhat unimpressed while viewing the first couple of episodes of season 1.  A lot of characters are thrown at you and the plot is not yet developed.  I'm glad I decided to hang in there because I was definitely hooked by the middle of the season 1 episodes. I actually ordered season 2 before I finished season 1.

The balance of Season One is just as enthralling and constitutes the best of television, that to my mind has never been surpassed.  It received tremendous reviews at the time and that fortified my opinion when I was able to read them.  The balance of the series is superb as well; it's just that the bar was set so high by the first episode and the first season that nothing, no matter how they tried could ever equal the draw it had on viewers like me.

2097760,5,B0002ERXC2,"I heard that this is the greatest show ever on TV. I was worried it couldn't live up to the hype, it does.

Important things to remember, it's not structured like a normal show. Most TV shows will have a sub plot that runs every episode, this doesn't. It's set up like a book, things aren't going to be 100 percent clear in the beginning. But it will all come together. If it doesn't, you didn't pay attention and this is a show you NEED to pay attention to.

This show will not hold your hand through most scenes. If something big happens, it won't alert you to it with music, or a close up or a character telling you that this is important. It expects you to realize what's going on.

Most of these actors I don't know, so to me it is really easy to believe that they are not actors but these are the actual lives of these people. It's meant to feel like a documentary, and it truly does feel like one.

There were very few moments that wowed me or made me feel extreme emotions, but yet, every time an episode ended, I had to know what was going to happen. Even when I finished the season and everything wraps up, I had to start the second one right away and see what happens next.

I recommend this show to any and everyone, above the age of 18. It's a great show and you should give it a try. I am done with three seasons and I can tell you, that if the first one was just good to you, you'll like the second and especially the third one a lot more.",1378339200,2,1454,4.052264808362369

But then the story line and strong characterizations by an ensemble of brilliant actors hooked me and I could not stop watching. It is really a brilliant show. Season One was eye-opening and insightful in depicting the social and economic community within the Projects in Baltimore. Having recently read Isabel Wilkerson's The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America's Great Migration, about the migrations of African Americans out of the South to the north, east and west from the 1930s through the 1960s changing the human landscape of America and leading to the development of inner city ghettos and the various Projects in many of the major cities of America connected and made sense. America's endemic racism can be seen in the white power structures that created and perpetuates social inequality, injustice, spiritual and economic poverty; and what goes on in these Projects is a pernicious capitalism that cheapens life, undermines human values, and deepens the schism between Americans divided by race and capital. The well written scripts of The Wire have lines that are unforgettable and often sum up American values. The municipal politics, the relationships that govern the politics and actions of responsible citizens have created stasis - a feeling of no way out.  This is a must see series.

Sure, Game of Thrones is lush and complicated, Homeland keeps us guessing and Breaking Bad has Bryan Cranston, but none of these have the depth and breadth of The Wire. The fact that each season developes a different main theme helps keep it from getting old.

They take out their tape measures and sharpies and start measuring and marking. During this inspection no other word is uttered but the f bomb. One cop seems to discover something and he drops it, the other cop does the same, back and forth for like five minutes. Its not the language that disturbs me at all, its just that the scene itself totally bombs becasue its so stupid. The whole show is like that.

2097784,5,B0002ERXC2,"""The Wire"" is one of those truly great pieces of television cinema.  It's a show that, even in its weakest moments, still entertains, shocks and compels the viewer.  Baltimore is known for being the home of the Star Spangled Banner, the Orioles and Ravens, the great Harbor, Aquarium, and Science Center.  It's also known for its seedier side of rundown tenements which are fertile ground for rampant crime.  In a way that few other crime dramas have (Baltimore-based ""Homicide"" included), ""The Wire"" goes straight to the brutal core of the lives and motivations of the criminals, the police officers who are pursuing them and the politicians who may be hedging their bets with both.

  Season 1 sets the table masterfully as troubled detective, Jimmy McNulty (Dominic West), learns about a shadowy drug organization called the `Barksdale Gang', so named after its leader, Avon Barksdale (Wood Harris).  Jimmy has numerous sources that keep him close enough to the street that he hears about this group that the rest of Baltimore PD hasn't not heard of (due to Barksdale's expert control of information).  After stirring up enough pots to get senior administration interested in taking down the crew, McNulty is assigned to a task force of seemingly screwed up, but enormously talented, street and investigative police officers.

  The series name is a reference to the wire taps (on land line phones and cellular phones) that the task force makes use of to get intel to work against Barksdale.  There are some great scenes involving how the criminal empire is structured,  how information is compartmentalized and how they manage to stay one step ahead of the cops (such as using temporary cell phones called `burners').

  In addition to the great narrative and background of ""The Wire"", this series also benefits from an astounding array of truly memorable characters, such Lester, Bunk, Bubbles, Senator Clay Harris (`sheeeeeeeeeeeet'), Prop Joe, Stringer Bell (Barksdale's second in command), and the ubiquitous free-agent stick up man, Omar (""Omar's Coming!!!"").

  Upon a first viewing, ""The Wire"" may seem to start off slow.  However, that is not a fault of the series writers.  It is simply a matter that there is so much information for the viewer to take in at first, in order to get the overall scope of the environment, that it takes a while before familiarity comes into play.  Once it does, the show really takes off and the viewer ends up realizing the slower beginning was completely necessary.

2097802,5,B0002ERXC2,"A TV show that unfolds like a good book , slowly and with many layers. This storyline has the feeling of reality like no other I have seen portrayed. It is NC-17 for the language , some violence and a little nudity so if you expect the ""soft"" stories of broadcast TV this may be too radical of a change. Barney Miller it ain't.

Watching it each week on HBO was a joy , now that I have the DVDs a quick re-wind allows a chance to pick up a nuanced scene for details missed on a previous viewing. There are people and events that are revisited after more that a season , this rarely happens in a typical 1 hour serial show. We see good people who sometimes do bad things ... bad people who sometimes do good things and an image of a system (criminal/political/social) that is F.U.B.A.R. I can not recommend this highly enough. If the language and somewhat slow pace don't put you off there is a breadth and depth of story to absorb.

Sometimes adding subtitles helps but don't expect too much from the Closed Captioning. The CC seems to have been done by a child and has many missing or misspelled words. The captioning errors are my only real complaint about the discs.

I appreciate that it felt like i was watching something that was based on a true story. Every character was flawed in some way and were just trying to get by. In the finale, some people dies, some lived, some became addicts, some gangsters, some went to prison, cops were promoted and demoted (whether or not they deserved it). The endings felt very realistic. While I loved the whole series and recommend watching all four, my favorites are 1 & 2. I couldn't believe the last season aired in 2007.

Any one that watches the show loves it, but its amazing how many people never heard of it because it was never won anything, at least nothing I am aware of. It is a gritty crime drama that shows the struggle between the Baltimore Police and the drug pushers in the projects. What makes this show realistic is that there is no clear good guys or bad guys. The characters are all human. From the cops and politicians to the Kingpins and their rock slinging street thug employees...all the characters in the show have their vices and their sense of a moral code. Sometimes the good guys have to play dirty to get an advantage on the Criminals, and sometimes the criminals show a surprising amount of heart, honor, and even good citizenship in many cases.

2097834,5,B0002ERXC2,"The debate over ""The Wire"" realistic storylines and characters, really take away from the overall message - that in ""order to make things better you have to take action."" A criticism of ""The Wire"" is its lack of showing success stories, such as the work done by Baltimore's ACORN and Algebra Project. These groups mobilized families and teachers to pressure a Mayor to provide state funds to better the public school system. But that is in no way ""The Wire"" mission or intent to show its audience. Even creator David Simon explained that the show was meant to show the ugly side of urban city life and provoke action.
It is my belief that ""The Wire"" is has a lot of relevance today. It is fascinating that even five years after the series has ended, you can still see storylines and characters in everyday urban politics and even on some level the American nation. As a Philadelphia resident, I have witnessed the city become a place with some of the highest death and crime rates. Furthermore, the school system has completely fallen apart, as the neighborhoods and families fight with the city and school district over the reorganization of the system. In the ""Is The Wire Too Cynical?"" authors Atlas and Drier say that Obama represents the hope again as Bush ends his two terms, while paralleling this with the ending of The Wire. To be clear, I am a supporter of Obama and support many of his policies and platforms, but I believe he in some ways mirrors Carcetti. In season 4, Carcetti is the hopeful young politician who desires to improve the city of Baltimore, but when he gets into office - he learns that politics is a game and by season 5, he is more interested in look to the next election instead of his original mission.
Overall, I believe that while ""The Wire"" at times is a little exaggerated it does have relevance to our world. But most of all this should not be a ""pity party"" show that makes people angry, but a show that makes people driven to improve the problems in their own cities.",1359417600,,2006,4.5595567867036015
2097835,5,B0002ERXC2,"After scrolling through a couple pages of reviews on the show, there are some points that need to be reinforced. While most of the reviews are positive and praise David Simon's writing, there are some that don't grasp what the show is trying to accomplish. This is not another NCIS, Law and Order, or Castle-type show. There is no tidy end to each episode where the protagonists succeed and the criminals caught. It is a linear show that tells a complex story and attempts to depict a particular way of life in Baltimore -- this is what makes it so unique and intriguing. There is no cheesy, cliche dialogue amongst characters like in more mainstream crime dramas, instead there is more authentic dialouge with slang from street characters, police jargon from law enforcement, etc.

The Wire also doesn't pull any punches when it portrays life for Baltimore's lower class. While some may view the depiction as overly bleak and pessimistic, the show prides itself on delving deeply into some of the most concerning social issues facing the city: drugs, politics, education, labor, and journalism. If the show did not create a feeling of despair for its viewers, the issues wouldn't be able to be taken seriously by the audience. Only by fully revealing the negative aspects of life can the show develop a sense of legitimacy and impart real understanding to viewers.",1359331200,,1365,4.883620689655173
2097836,5,B0002ERXC2,"The first installment of David Simon's transcendent TV series The Wire already demonstrates why the show is so beloved, even 10 years after its original run. The first season leaves the viewer somehow both shell-shocked and utterly dissatisfied, making it nearly impossible to do anything but pick up the second season and pop it into the DVD player. The show's ability to evoke powerful emotions and deep questions that the first season is unlike anything else we've ever seen on TV. The fact that many diehard fans of the show find this season to be the worst of the series' five seasons is amazing when looking at this season in isolation, and speaks volumes as to the quality of the series as a whole.
 The Wire depicts the conflicts between the Baltimore Police Department and the city's criminal organizations, primarily the drug dealing Barksdale crew (at least in the first season). Where the show really shines is when it shows us the tensions within these organizations. The Baltimore PD always seem to be battling between cops who actually want to do real police work and those who want to just ride the system until their next paycheck or promotion. On the other side of the yellow tape there seems to be the opposite problem, where anybody who doesn't play the drug dealing game with all they've got is likely to end up dead. And when good-natured guys like D'Angelo Barksdale (Larry Gilliard Jr.) or Wallace (Michael B. Jordan) try to buck the game for their own morals, the game always bucks back.
 The first season received an overwhelming amount of positive feedback from critics when it originally aired, some calling it even better than some of HBO's most beloved series such as Six Feet Under and The Sopranos. Despite all of these accolades the show did not gain a large following of viewers, a problem that would persist in some form until the show's fifth and final season. In fact, many fans of the show did not watch the original one, and have since found their love for the show through watching the episodes on DVD or online (much in the same way Arrested Development has).
 There is so much to like about this season. The technical proficiency and artistry of the directorial decisions would put this season on par with many Oscar nominees. The acting is absolutely superb, which is necessary for the amount of investment the show runners have us as the audience put in to each character. However, one of the most fantastic things about this season is its ability to subvert conventions with a defiance that wouldn't be out of place in a 1980s punk rocker. For example, the show's coolest, most badass character is Omar. Omar robs drug dealers for a living, carries a giant shotgun, and commands fear from everybody around him. To compensate for this the show's writers make him gay in the traditionally homophobic black ghetto community. Other characters often make jokes about his sexuality, but they always give him respect. And this is only one example. They also set up such subversions as making no character immortal no matter how beloved or popular they are, and refusing to put a flat character into the show, instead giving every single one motives and feelings associated with their actions.
 The only critique I have for this season isn't so much something that I wish they had taken the time to improve, as much as it is pointing out a necessary evil that comes with the nature of the show. The reason many fans find this to be the worst season is because they spend so long setting up the characters and their situations from which we can begin the story. While this does take a long time, the show develops slowly from the way that it's written and paced. It's simply part of the show's style. And any less exposition would leave the plot turns and character developments later wanting in emotional catharsis.
 I would recommend this series to those well versed in film or TV shows, simply because it takes everything you thought you could expect and turns it on its head. I would also caution you before you begin to make sure that you have the time to put in to this series, as each episode is a full hour long (because HBO doesn't have commercials). If you enjoyed this season, there really isn't anything to do but keep watching the series. When you finish with this one, some other comparable series are Breaking Bad and Mad Men. 5/5",1359331200,,4381,4.69921875
2097837,4,B0002ERXC2,"Long after the show aired its' episode, viewers have both critiqued and applauded the grisly inner city life challenges the show so harshly portrays. Yet with all the hullabaloo as to whether or not The Wire truly gave scope to a depressing and bleak American reality, The Wire has gained a dedicated follower in me. To start, I knew literally nothing about Baltimore prior to screening the show. The extent of my Baltimore knowledge was limited to where it was in relation to D.C. (where I attend university) and also that they have a marvelous aquarium that I still feel guilty I have not been to yet. Dissent Magazine's article ""Is The Wire Too Cynical?"" provides a fairly scathing review as to the show's failure to truly portray all the positive aspects of grassroots activism in the city, stating that not only does the show leave out such inspiring characters and story lines, but also does not acknowledge the law abiding poor. From an unbiased standpoint, this is true. Granted, I am only eleven episodes into the first season (don't give anything away!) but generally, those who live on the street are portrayed as very ""street"" and not, as The Code of  the Street by Anderson discusses, very ""decent"". In my opinion though, portrayal of hope and community effectiveness would take away from the show's bite and overall grit. As a television show, it has the power to shock viewers into wanting to make a difference, and think about problems they may not have realized existed before. I'd posit that the danger in including positive activism in a show like this tends to make viewers more comfortable with what they see. For example, if we knew that Wallace was put into a program for at risk youth after his trials and tribulations in the pit, his story would be wrapped up nicely and stamped with a big red ""success"" on his folder. Because there is very little social success that is depicted, the role of The Wire is not so much to display the good, as much as the bad and the despairing, in the hope that good will actually be catalyzed in our reality, off of the television screen.",1359331200,,2096,4.664864864864865
2097838,2,B0002ERXC2,"I've been hearing critics rave about this show and finally decided to buy it instead of waiting for Netflix.  I just don't get it.  There are way too many characters to keep up with and I don't really care about any of them.  I loved Idris Elba in ""Luther"" but he's not even a main character.",1359244800,2,292,4.178571428571429
2097839,5,B0002ERXC2,"The Wire is probably the best series I've ever watched. I recently purchased the series thinking that it may not be as good the second time around. On the contrary the series is just as good the second time as the first. Knowing the outcome does not diminish it's quality at all. This time around I am able to reflect more on the characters, events taking shape and the social setting.
For those who may not know anything about The Wire; the series is about a Baltimore drug dealer and his partners and crew. A special police unit is formed to try and catch this drug dealer. It is not long before the inspiration of this unit, Detective McNulty realizes the only way they are going to catch this guy is to use wire taps. Once the wire taps are installed the unit begins to see how sophisticated this group of drug dealers are.
The unit is in a constant battle with police brass for survival.. Politics, backstabbing and dirty deals take place on both sides of the fence. Ethics, rights, morality and law are all gobbled up by the pervasive need to survive.
This series is a must see for anyone interested social policy, politics and just plain old good entertainment.",1359158400,,1168,4.514150943396227

2097851,5,B0002ERXC2,"I watched all of the The Wire when it originally aired, and now I'm rewatching the entire series again. In all of the passing years, I don't think any other series has surpassed it in terms of amazing writing, acting, and a take-no-prisoners narrative style that neither dumbs down nor sentimantalizes a single thing.

Is the first season of The Wire the best? One could argue that it is, because it was so new and groundbreaking at the time that David Simon and Co. didn't have the ""How are we going to outdo this"" onus that marred Season 2 and occasionally caused narrative lapses in seasons 3, 4 and 5. It's also the strongest season because the narrative focused solely on developing the stories of the ""poh-lice"" and the criminals. It didn't let ""bigger"" issues like corruption on the docks, mayoral elections or the plight of city newspapers dilute this central premise. For the most part, The Wire was able to successfully integrate these themes into the main narrative without ever jumping the shark, even in its weakest episodes.

Some people claim that the pace of the first season is slow, particularly those who were hooked by the images of the computers and phone lines displayed in the opening sequences. But this pace reflected the true difficulty of getting things done in a post 9/11 law enforcement environment, when all attention and funds were diverted to monitoring library card use rather than combating good old fashioned drug dealers and gang violence. These cops aren't heroes; they're flawed, lazy, alcoholic, career- focused, bigoted, abusive and, except for lone wolves like McNulty, Kima and Freeman, generally fearful of rocking the boat. In short, they're human. Just like many of the crew in the Low-Risers are. A teenage dealer wakes up a bunch of homeless kids living in a decrepit apartment and sends them off to school. D'Angelo Barksdale, boss of the drug pit, shows genuine remorse when confronted with the death of an a witness who had testified against him even though he wasn't responsible for the man's death. In the face of unsparing poverty and hopelessness, they occasionally try to do good.

If there is one episode of Season 1 that stands out, it's the fourth episode, written by Simon. It features the hilariously vulgar defense of McNulty by his self-effacing sargeant, and Lester Freeman's backstory. But the true stand-out scene occurs when McNulty and his partner Bunk are meticulously re-examining a long-dormant murder scene. As they place crime scene photos and wield tape measures and explore every surface in a kitchen where the shooting had taken place, the only word either man speaks for nearly five minutes is the f-word and variations therefor. But it's not spoken merely as an expletive, but as an adjective, an adverb, a question, an answer, and a hypothetical. Such a scene shouldn't work at all; its sheer audacity calls attention to its artifice, but somehow it works because the two cops have worked so closely together they can use a single word to communicate everything with each other. For this scene alone, the entire first season is worth purchasing.",1357171200,,3124,4.946666666666666
2097852,5,B0002ERXC2,I haven't re-watched this - but I remember back in the day when I did.  Thorough entertainment.  Can't wait to see the later seasons.,1357171200,,133,4.5
2097853,5,B0002ERXC2,"I'm late to the party, I know.  I had heard about The Wire, how it was critically received and what a great show it was.  I just wasn't interested in early 2000s and now I am sorely regretting that decision.  I just finished the first season and I am just starting the second one and this is probably the -best- show I have ever seen on television.  I give HBO huge props for getting this show renewed over and over despite the ratings so people like me can watch it and awe at the brilliance of the show.  I admit, I'm a kind of procedural junkie...I grew up on Law & Order and loved watching cop shows..even popcorn junks like Bones and CSI.  This blows them all out of the water.  It's gritty, funny, heartbreaking, intelligent and bittersweet at times.  You love and hate the characters on the show because they come across as real personalities, not just as the ""smart cop"" ""dumb cop"" ""good cop"" ""bad cop"" etc.  Whether it's realistic?  I can't say, but these characters come across as more real than some of the actual people on those reality shows.

I can't say enough praise about this show.  They say the best show of 2012 was Homeland and I got the first season for that show and after watching the first episode, went right back to watching The Wire.  I am not sure whether I can return to watching TV again (well until Breaking Bad comes back) after this.

Caution though: This is NOT an action packed show.  There is -a lot- of fast dialogues that you can miss easily if you're not paying attention and well... there're just a lot of talking in general.  It's also not episodic so you either watch the whole thing or you don't at all.  The drama is very subtle. There are few screaming, few crying, no dramatic lines preceded by dramatic turn in the music, slow-mo cam zooming into important scenes so you know this is *important* etc.  Basically, it doesn't treat you like you're dumb.  It's like a long novel that is put together visually piece by piece and some of the lines are just absolute zingers. If you are not into that, I would not suggest it.

Oh and this has very -bad- language.  Like profanity and stuff.  If you can't stomach profanity in your shows please don't buy this.",1356825600,2,2201,4.422885572139304

Under the guise of a simple detective show, it dives deep into the underbelly of a dying, dysfunctional city, with a raw depiction of urban decay mixed with hope. The producers hold nothing back as they confront racism, social injustice, and the complex relationship with the law that only true poverty can illuminate.

So I encountered this 2002 crime series only 10 years later. I had heard that it is considered by some to be the best ever. That is quite possibly true.
In 2002, the FBI had a new job description, defined by 9-11, and was not interested in drug gangs.
The Baltimore police, under pressure from the judiciary after a witness murder,  sets up a special unit, half heartedly, to investigate a mystery man related to drug distribution and murders. The unit consists of some dead weight guys and some outsiders, but it grows into the job. There is more than just drugs and killing witnesses or rivals. There is a vast real estate scam and political corruption, extending into the police force. We are following both sides, the cops as well as the gangs in their business processes.
The series has 13 episodes. It focuses on this one big case, the job of unravelling the gang. The work is based on electronic surveillance, hence the series title.

2097907,5,B0002ERXC2,"Perversely, Americans flee to reality television to escape reality by entering a world that is surreal, not real.  And oddly, some of the most realistic television ever made is being made right now.  I once read that you can bring a group of conservatives, liberals, and libertarians together and they will all love The Wire, because they will all find something in it to confirm their worldview.  I'm sure this is true.  It's not because David Simon and Ed Burns made any effort to present a balanced view.  Quite the opposite: they presented an unflinchingly honest view.  So of course people draw from this what they draw from the real world.

Many have said that The Wire is the greatest TV show ever produced.  I can't attest to that, but I will say that it is the greatest TV show I have ever watched.  And a very peculiar sort of TV show it is, appropriately described as ""novel-esque.""  Individual episodes rarely come with their own climax, viewers are expected to watch each episode and recall events from the beginning of the season at the end, and the cast of characters is sprawling.

I have watched the entire five season run of The Wire, and it is a delight to see each characters beginnings again: the path for some is obvious, others veer sharply from the direction they were headed, and others are not as they appear.  And none are anywhere near where they will end up.  They multiply like cockroaches, but the main characters for season 1 are: Jimmy McNulty, the brilliant homicide detective with a disastrous personal life; Cedric Daniels, a straight-laced police lieutenant with a shady past and a bright future in the force; Kima Greggs, an openly gay and calmly competent narcotics detective; Bubbles, a loquacious heroin addict and reformer; and D'Angelo Barksdale, a mid-level drug dealer who beats a murder rap in episode 1 and is the nephew of the target for season 1.

Each season of The Wire has a broad theme and focus (the entire series is thematically about institutional failure), and Season 1 focuses on street drug dealers through the prism of the effort to catch drug kingpin Avon Barksdale and the self-destruction of homicide detective Jimmy McNulty.

I think the hype that you can't miss an episode and that it takes a while to get into is overblown.  I missed an episode on my initial watch of each season and maintained a pretty good hold on what was going on.  I was also hooked from watching the last half hour of an episode on HBO while on a business trip, postponing drinks with my coworkers to finish what I thought was some masterful gangster movie that had somehow escaped my notice.  That being said, this is not a show to put on in the background while wandering in and out of the living room.  It does demand your attention.

The Wire is notoriously hard to follow, but the producers do what they can to help on the DVD.  Selecting an episode opens another menu with options to watch the ""previously on,"" to watch the ""next on,"" to select a scene, and provides an introductory synopsis for the episode.

Simon and the other commentators provide a lot of great context and insight on the DVD commentary, but it can also get overbearing.  To a certain extent, particularly when Simon gets into his personal views, it can become ""sausage making.""  Only the first, second, and penultimate episode of the season have commentary.  Please be forewarned that spoilers abound, including spoilers for the second season.",1314835200,,3460,4.726666666666667
2097908,5,B0002ERXC2,"I recently discovered the series The Wire 2 weeks ago when I picked up season 1 on DVD. Personally, i'm not a big fan of cop/drama shows however, everyone I know gives the show rave reviews and holds it in high regard so i figured i'd pick it up.
At first, I wasn't too fond of the show.  On the surface, the first few episodes seemed like your typical run of the mill police show, but soon enough i truly started caring for the characters on my screen.  The show is exceptionally well-written with a complex storyline and every episode is packed with so much drama its almost as if every episode has been adapted from a novel.
I enjoy that the story isn't simply told from the police officer's point of view, but also The Barksdale Crew, who are the drug dealing gang that supplies crack and heroin throughout their Baltimore projects.
I highly reccomend this series to anyone who enjoys really well-written television dramas. It's a shame that the show wasn't a bigger hit back when it was on the air.

2097914,5,B0002ERXC2,"Many reviews of this have already said things that I would, so will not say those things. ""The Wire"" is an indescribable show, and I truly believe it to be the best show of all time. I cannot believe it has not won any awards. But that says more about those awards than about the ""The Wire"".
  ""The Wire"" is even an educational show, and shows us a lot about what's happened to America in recent years. It teaches us about institutions and individuals, and how they overlap. Even superlatives can't describe ""The Wire"".
  Much humor in this show comes from the ignorance of the dealers, and the antics of Sgt. Jay Landsman (Delaney Williams). Williams easily steals every scene he is in. It seems unfair to point out standouts, but hey, life is unfair. Standouts are Williams as Landsman, Dominic West as the epically insubordinate Det. Jimmy McNulty, and Idris Elba as ""Stringer"" Bell.

There were similiar shows on TV, in the mold of carefully setting up its characters slowly.  These shows went by the names of LOST and the Sopranos.  The main differences here aren't that one took place on an island or in restaurants and the other on the streets.  The main difference, is The Wire knew what the heck it was doing.

2097917,5,B0002ERXC2,"Buying a television series on DVD is generally a wasted investment - once you watch the series rarely will you go back and watch it again. At best it would end up being a secret santa present or a rotating loan between friends and family. The Wire is different and actually worth the investment. The first season itself starts off a little slow, which is likely when everyone who rated this less than 5 stars stopped watching. The beauty of the show lies in the careful character development and the attention to detail. There are no extra characters who appear in one episode never to be seen again - even the seemingly least important background character will come up again later in the season and again in subsequent seasons. More importantly there are no filler episodes in the season - each one is important to the plot of the season, the overall plot of the series and to the development of major and minor characters.

I wouldn't consider myself a tv junkie or a dedicated fan of crime dramas like Law & Order, but this series is simply too good to miss out on. Watching the season again, particularly after having watched the subsequent seasons, you gain an even greater appreciation for the character development and you pick up on a ton of details that didn't seem important the first time through.",1298592000,2,1309,4.642241379310345
2097918,5,B0002ERXC2,"Critics have called it the best series on TV. The reviewers praised the relatively unknown cast, narrative structure and action-filled plots of this police drama.

For me, however, this was much more that a police story. It was about challenges to change societies and systems.
Why police cannot deal with crime properly? Why it is hard to improve education system? Why politicians don't deliver on all of their promises? Why media is weak to provide independent and unbiased reports that matter? Why there is still extreme poverty in the world? It is easy to blame the teachers, politicians, special interest or ""bad guys"". In reality the answer is much more complicated. The Wire digs deep into difficulties to reform systems in a beautiful way that is both entertaining and educational.
Be it the war on crime, war on poverty or war against terrorism, The Wire illustrates why it is hard to make a lasting change.
Each season introduces new elements, starting from local gangs, drug dealers to judges, politicians, taxes and budgets, international criminals, labor unions, schools and media. Every actor has to work harmoniously to keep the system sustainable.

Here is the deal, when you watch this you need to

1. Pay attention - a lot of stuff happens and all of the characters are fleshed out. There are no cliche characters here.

2. Watch more than a couple of episodes - there is no payoff at the end of the first few episodes. The only payoffs in the series come at the end of the seasons. Everything prior is building up to the end of the season.

3. Be prepared for grit - this is not some glossed over show like the ones you are used to on the networks. This is gritty and as real as possible. The extras in many cases are real people from Baltimore including cops and criminals. There will be bad language and there will be harsh realities. It is not a happy ending type show. The good guys do not always win, and you do not know who the good guys are all of the time. You will at times find yourself gaining a certain level of respect for drug dealers and rooting for a guy who sticks up drug dealers and sells the drugs himself.

Watched episode 2, became more convince my fears were true (said to myself ""this still doesn't seem very amazing... where's the mind blowing-ness?"")... then I went out for the afternoon and kept thinking about the show. And kept thinking about it. And kept thinking about it. And realized... what other show do I continue to think about for hours after I'm done watching? Almost none is the answer. So I got home and watched another episode. Over the next two days I watched the entire season.

Not a let down in any way, shape, or form. Everyone says you should watch this? There's a darned good reason for that. This show is one of the most compelling and well written stories I've ever come across in TV, movies, or books... period. I can't say much more that hasn't been said by the 242 reviews which precede this one, so I'll just re-iterate that you should watch this show. Having fully expected to be let down, having had the bar set so high there was no way I could see the show actually reaching those heights... I was proven completely wrong. It's one of those very, very rare things that not only lives up to the insane hype but then surpasses it and turns you into yet another evangelist.

2097923,5,B0002ERXC2,"This is a really well written crime show. Or more accurately a video novel for television. TV is full of shows about crime and the police, but its all mostly melodrama for children. The first season of ""the wire"" is a dense show full of realistic characters and offers a tremendous view into the politics of a large modern American city. And it gives its due to both sides of the law. It gives as much insight into the housing project drug trade as it does to police, prosecutors, politics and the courts. We see a single case evolve over the course of a season. We see the arbitrary nature of how/why law enforcement decisions are made. We see the politics of law enforcement and we see the ""politics"" of the drug trade at housing projects.

I ignored this show for a long time because I was so tired of law&order and the various CSIs. Television, for a while, was full of trivial crime drama. But this is different.

2097925,5,B0002ERXC2,"Yes, the rave reviews are all true about The Wire, and yet the first few episodes in Season One might have you beleive otherwise.  Dialogue is a bit forced at times and sometimes has that 'scripted' feel.  It doesn't take long though for the show to find it's groove and total absorption to ensue - will certainly be the case by mid-season and definitely by the end.  Fortunately there are 4 more seasons after this each better than the next *though people argue about season 5.  Don't worry - you're in for a riveting ride, and more lost sleep than you might think possible.  Careful about starting this on a night (or week) where you have to get up the next day.  The dangerous thing about the DVD set is that you CAN go on to the next episode without needing to wait a week.  You can go on.. and on.. and on.

I have to admit, McNulty was never my favorite character, and one of the reasons I feel later seasons are better than Season 1 (still great in its own right, no mistake) is that his dominance recedes season by season so that he's hardly even in Season 4.  I admit I kind of liked him in Season 5 - hey, the situation called for it.  But, that's another review.  Get 'The Wire'.  You'll love it.

This has a large cast, and it takes a while to put every one of them in their place.  You've got your politicians, your police, your detectives, your FBI, your reporters, your drug runners, your murderers, your spouses, your lovers, and your drug kingpins.  Wow!  And those are just the main characters.

The conceit of the series is that the police must get judges (oops, forgot them in the cast...) to approve wiretaps.  In the first season, that means the pay phones that the drug runners and drug middlemen use to run their drug trade, primarily in the projects.

The cast is outstanding.  The setting is good, the photography great.

I liked the first series, even though the ending is sort of a let down because there are many loose ends.  However, that just sets up the second season.

Highly recommended.  It paints a picture of the intractability of shutting down drug traffic, because if you put one cadre out of business, another quickly takes its place.  After all, nature abhors a marketplace vacuum.

I liked this a lot.  Season two promises to be just as good.

Update:  I've seen the entire series, and all I can say is, wow!  This is television of the highest caliber.  It's violent, to be sure, and sometime hard to watch because of it, but I guess that world is really that violent.

The Wire however isn't one of those ponderous, overly earnest dramas, but an accessable show that takes you into the lives of the various characters that make up this richly structured fictional world, and it's certainly never as pretentious as this sentence is. It does one of the very few things that 'realistic and gritty' tv shows often never do by not forgetting to bring the humour along for the ride.

The plot is relatively complex but it's never hard to follow due to the acting talents of the cast, stellar writing, and the fact that you can't help but become invested in the show. The writers make you feel like you're in safe hands and that they know where they're going, and whomever did the casting deserves a thumbs up and a pat on the head, the recessions answer to a payrise.

It probably sat there for a year.  Then on a whim one cold winter evening, I decided to pop it in the DVD player.  I thought the first episode was good, but not earth shattering as many of the reviews on this site suggest.  But, I nonetheless stuck with it.  By the sixth or seventh episode, I was completely hooked.  What magnificent storytelling with fully realized, complex characters!  No one is perfect in this series, and everyone is flawed a a major way.  And what I like most is the writers' willingness to make drug dealers  - who, let's face it, are not viewed with much sympathy by damn near anyone - look, talk and act like real human beings (who can be just as fascinating as the people we more traditionally choose to admire).  THE WIRE is television at its finest - it simply doesn't get any better.  But here's a kicker for you - this series never won a single major television award.  NOT ONE!!!

2097935,5,B0002ERXC2,"This review is from: The Wire: The Complete First Season (DVD)
I am such a fan of 'The Wire'. I watched every show on HBO, and then when the series came out on DVD, my first request was for 'The Wire'. Once you have seen one show, you cannot stop. You know this because you are reading this review and have found it to be so true.

I have become entranced with every character- McNulty, Daniels, Greggs, Freamen, Moreland, Hauck, Sydnor, Rawls, Burrell, Norris, and Omar, Barksdale and Bubbles. All the detectives in Baltmore, their superiors, the street gang, and the people, the innocent people. David Simon the writer who gave us 'The Wire' wanted us to get to know all of them. we started to care about them. 'Damn, that Rawls for putting McNulty in such a position. Burrell, protecting all of his cronies, thinking he was doing his job...but we knew better. The streets, the drugs, the terror, the blood and guts all of this so unreal to most of us. I thought many times, there but for the grace of God is me, there but for the benefit of my birth, I was given the good life, a white middle class life. The good and the evil, the crime that these brave detectives try to wipe out, day by day, doing the best job they can and becoming proud of the job they are doing. How can we not love this series? I finished year one in two days. I have seen it before, but I picked up new highlights- oh how I love this series.

In Season One, the police tried to infiltrate the West Baltimore drug ring. We saw the crime and evil, up close and personal. Yet,we find nothing is done in the real world. David Simon said ""We are a culture without the will to seriously examine our own problems. We eschew that which is complex, contradictory or confusing. As a culture, we seek simple solutions. We enjoy being provoked and titillated, but resist the rigorous, painstaking examination of issues that might, in the end, bring us to the point of recognizing our problems, which is the essential first step to solving any of them.""

Really, you must view this series again. You gotta do, go now.

Highly Highly Recommended. prisrob 12-21-09

2097936,5,B0002ERXC2,"I came to this series with very very high expectations:  it is supposed to be realistic with ambiguous outcomes and the realization of a wider tableau than normally expected in pat cop melodramas.  I was astonished to find that it surpassed my expectations by an order of magnitude, to the point that I unequivocally believe that this is the best coherent drama that I have ever seen on TV.  This isn't about taut drama that is self-contained in a single episode and full of deus ex machina resolutions, but a long multifaceted narrative with complex characters and deep themes on urban America at a time of industrial decline.  The acting - all by relative unknowns who are perfectly cast - could not be better:  the subtlety and slow evolution of the characters is unprecedented in my view, as is the realism.  You get difficult careers, vital political issues, and damaged personal lives, all while fulfilling the calling of being ""a police"".  I have never seen anything like it.

In this first season, a team slowly coalesces into a wonderful combination of talent, fanatical focus, and mission.  McNulty is the emotional focus of the team:  he is a screwup with an alcohol problem, but a great cop.  His family life is a disaster, his career in ruins because of his failures to play the politics.  Gifted with raw charm and a maniacal focus on getting the bad guys, he finds a way to become a member in an extraordinary team.  Though he has many internal enemies, there are many people of great talent he can latch onto.  He is a realistic participant in the Baltimore ecosystem of struggling workers in a deindutrialized economy, sociopathic drug dealers, corrupted politicians, and caring citizens, including cops.  One of his greatest enemies is the need to maintain statistics in the drug war, going for short-term showiness that hinders deeper investigations into crime lords who are entering legitimate businesses.

The underworld is a parallel universe with its own rituals and ethic.  The characters in it are also great, with vividly believable nicknames, like string and little man, and they are realistic personalities.  There are outcasts in it who are parasites in conflict with the organized crime figures who are corrupting politics in the city (e.g. Omar v. Stringer), pathetic junkies who try to survive (e.g. Bubbles), and young ghetto rats trying to make it and willing to murder their adversaries to do so.

What is the most interesting, for me, was the portrayal of the extraordinary intricacy, each with its uncertainties and consequences, of the way that a prosecutorial case must be put together.  While somewhat successful, it leaves much to be done, in the next seasons.  There are baddies pursued, and their organization in all its intricate parts become potential targets in a legal proceedings, with wonderful lawyers developing them with egotistical judges.

Each episode is dense, but dependent on the others and ever more densely complex.  You can watch them multiple times, with deeper perception of them at each viewing.  It is best not to watch too many in one sitting, but at most 2 per evening.

This is some of the best TV I have ever experienced.  Recommended with the greatest enthusiasm.",1259971200,5,3233,4.9517625231910944

2097938,5,B0002ERXC2,"I just finished watching Season 5 of The Wire and can say without a doubt that this series is an amazing journey from beginning (Season 1) to end (Season 5).  This show is for those that crave interesting storylines, unpredictable plot twists, characters that really grow on you from episode to episode, season to season and still somehow stay grounded to reality...its a show that breaks the rules and challenges the viewer.  Even though this show didn't win tons of awards like The Sopranos it is in my opinion a more rewarding viewing experience than The Sopranos.  This show is not for those who are impatient and have short attention spans or want instant gratification...if you are then you won't last the first few episodes of season 1.  The beauty of The Wire is that it grows and evolves so by the time you reach the final season things fall into place in such a masterful way that it is time well spent.  So if your ready for the journey then grab Season 1, keep an open mind, be patient, and absorb this masterpiece.",1256342400,2,1027,4.559782608695652

2097940,4,B0002ERXC2,I very rarely watch a series on cable but when I heard about THE WIRE and read some great reviews I felt it was worth a watch. I am glad I did! This show has so much detail to characters and plot and sub plots I cant believe all this stuff is based on real life experences and I have only watched the first season..The actors who are not celeberty types do a fantastic job on their portrayl of characters and I also understand there are some actual real people from the Baltimore streets in it as well. If you like realism and not just some writer taking a guess at what goes on this WIRE IS HIGHLY RECOMENDED..,1251676800,,611,4.142857142857143
2097941,5,B0002ERXC2,"The first one or two parts were hard to assimilate but once you got use to the slang and the reality that must go on in some of the big cities you learn to love it.

2097942,5,B0002ERXC2,"This show is simply great. It is subtle, nuanced, complex, realistic.
Sure, it is grim, there is a lot of profanity, a lot of difficult-to-understand slang, and it is quite uncompromising in its depiction of American cities.
But it explains a lot about societal issues that are difficult to summarize in terms of the usual ""good guys vs. bad guys"".
It's a real eye-opener.",1248652800,,372,4.828125

From the street-level ""consumer"" of crack and heroin to the halls of Congress and off-shore accounts, The Wire lays it out for us, through a range of well-developed characters whose lives are gripped by the mechanisms that control the market.

2097944,4,B0002ERXC2,"I put off watching The Wire when it was first on HBO because I felt like the media was forcing it on me as ""the best show on TV"".  So, years later I finally checked out the show on DVD and while it may not be the best show on TV...it's certainly the most realistic police drama I've ever come across.

The Wire shows two complex sides in downtown Baltimore.  On one end we have the task force of ""losers"" set up by the police to bring down kingpin drug dealer Avon Barksdale.  On the other side we have Barksdale's entire operation and the gritty life of dealer and junkie on the street.

The show resonates with reality.  The scenes and dialogue between the street dealers is very powerful and just looking at the slums...that has to be what it is really like.  The police characters on ""the wire detail"" cover all areas and none are portrayed as black and white.

A friend asked me to compare The Wire to The Shield.  I'd say The Shield is the better show if you're looking for a fast paced action drama.  The Wire is your choice if you're looking for gritty drama and realism to a frightening level.",1246752000,4,1102,4.305825242718447
2097945,5,B0002ERXC2,"TV does not get any better than ""The Wire"".  There are only a handful of shows that I've seen that even come close this exceptional series (most of them also from HBO).  ""The Wire"" excels in every aspect that makes for great TV -- first rate story-telling, superb acting, deep, complex and multi-dimensional character development, frighteningly realistic sense of place and masterful dialogue.

This is not a show for the weak of heart.  There are neat bow ties to tightly wrap up things.  Life if brutal in the streets of Baltimore.  A once proud, but economically distressed city that is mostly about the past and not the future.  Politics is a rough and tumble affair and the streets are rule by local drug lords protecting their turf and profits.  ""The Wire"" knocks you upside the head with a view into this reality -- undermanned police one step behind the drug crews, citizens threatened from testifying for fear of losing their life, kids chewed up and spit out by the drug dealers and dysfunctional bureaucracy more concerned with stats than with lives.

Season 1 is 13 riveting episodes, each more addicting than the other. All of this adds up to one of the most fresh and original series ever made.",1245801600,,1208,4.741626794258373
2097946,5,B0002ERXC2,"If you haven't seen an episode of The Wire, you really are missing something special. If you can't afford the DVDs, go to your local library; our library has all 5 seasons for check-out! Truly a phenomenal show!",1244419200,,211,4.578947368421052

2097948,1,B0002ERXC2,"I have watched 6 episodes of Season 1 and have desperately tried to get into The Wire.  Despite the hype, and all the trendies saying what a mahhvellous show it is, actually it is pretty dull.  Boring characters, little conflict, confusing scripts, same stuff repeated ad nauseam.  Frankly, the lives of petty drug dealers in Baltimore don't do it for me, and not do the cops who are a pretty unattractive bunch with few dramatic qualities.  I know that Prison Break was appallingly acted but at least it had a story line.  The Wire is like an improvisation at one of those let it all hang out stage schools which never produces particularly great actors.",1240099200,28,655,4.660869565217391
2097949,5,B0002ERXC2,"And this is the case, all other reviews said all the good things about this series, so I will not repeat them...well, no too much.

Before I bought this series ( I did it because the package with the whole 5 seasons was on sale on Amazon, and because the good reviews it received ) I never saw an episode of the wire.

I can tell you that, that I was hooked since the first few minutes, when McNulty speaks with a street kid on a homicide scene, ""..This is America, man""... That was good.

Intelligent, realistic, not your usual cop story, very well acted ( Dominic West's best performance ).

This series is so good, I finished the first season like 3 weeks ago, and I haven't seen the second just yet, because, just like a junky from this series, I don't want to see them too quickly, I don't want something this good to finish too soon.

Buy it, take your time to see the details, watch it several times if you need to, enjoy it! This is as good as entertainment gets!!",1236816000,,972,4.232432432432432

2097951,3,B0002ERXC2,"2 1/2 stars. i usually buy dvds if they have good reviews in the type of genre i like. Anyway, the reviews are over-rated. The acting is GREAT from the key actors. A couple of the goofy idiot cops should have been replaced. But the directing and the writing are WAY OFF. This show would really appeal gangbangers n ppl like dat. Eg. The show has a curtain lingo, if you arnt 'in the life' you probably won't get alot of whats goin on. The writers have written it in away that details of the show that are supposed to be obvious can easily be over looked.
This show goes for 1 hr on its own, on dvd. no shows do that. this may be an issue with getting a time-slot. I bought this on special for $15 au. Which is about $10 US atm. No way would i pay $60 US, for a 13 episode show. ha",1234742400,3,780,3.9430379746835444
2097952,5,B0002ERXC2,"The Wire is an excellent show, great casting, interesting storylines, good scripts, and certainly different from the regular tv cop shows.

However, if you are NOT ONE to be committed to EACH episode, faithfully, with dedication to script, observant, with keen awareness, willingness to re-watch for better clarity to plot and characters, you might not wish to begin the series.  The storylines are very complex, and if you don't understand all, you tend to miss important details.  You must also have some awareness for corruption in the system, and some insight into the operations of the drug world.

The drama doesn't solve itself each week, it continues, in other words, the bad guy isn't always caught or neither is the murder of the day solved in 60 minutes, neither are there happy endings at season's end.  Storylines are not cut and dried for the viewer to understand, you must work at each show, work to understand what is going on, as there are many characters in the police force, the justice system, and of course the streets where the drug world plays out.  Actors in The Wire tend to mumble a lot, so it is imperative that you pay close attention, as names and associations are not clearly identified.

The first season focuses on the drug gang of the streets of Baltimore, where murders, witnesses, money, corrupt politicians, failed justice system, and drugs are a way of life.  Excellent Show....don't fall asleep while viewing!....Rizzo",1234051200,4,1456,4.938524590163935

2097954,5,B0002ERXC2,"If you're into television drama that paints an image of real world issues with realistic images of different kinds of people with complexity, you'll love The Wire.

Season 1, which I didn't watch when originally broadcast back in 2002, is absolutely brilliant.  The best way 2 describe this show's brilliance is by acknowledging 2 things: 1) the characters are multi-dimensional kind've like the movie ""Crash"" -- nobody's all good & nobody's all bad.  So whether it's a drug dealer, a cop, a hopper, a lieutenant, a dope fiend or a regular tax-paying citizen, The Wire does a great job endowing characters with enough redeeming qualities that it isn't easy 2 dismiss everyone as all good or all bad.  2)The Wire attempts to show how complex moral issues are.  They'll show u a drug dealer but also show you conditions that said drug dealer comes from which contribute 2 some of the decisions these individuals make.  The point being that everything isn't as black and white as the religious right would have you believe.

It's easy to dismiss this show as the latest ""Cop show"" but The Wire is soooo much more!

I don't think any TV show short of some of the work of the genius of Norman Lear's 1970s line (All In the Family, Good Times, The Jeffersons, Maude, etc.) has so cleverly if not realistic portrayed characters on TV as real people and how real people deal with real life issues!

This show is worthy of all the praise it receives (which isn't enough).

Highly recommended purchase.",1233532800,2,1492,4.725868725868726
2097955,5,B0002ERXC2,"The Wire is the type of show that can easily encourage hyperbole in its reviews.  The show centers on the drug trade in the city of Baltimore and takes you inside this world effortlessly and completely by offering not just the perspective of the police trying to eliminate drug trafficking but that of the users, the dealers, the smugglers, the pushers and the criminal bosses as well.
The writing can't be beat, every scene is well crafted, written and acted and the show manages to get across any number of salient points without ever seeming preachy or ever forgetting that its primary job is to tell the most riveting tales possible.
As a writer I have to mention the uncanny command of dialogue that the writers employ.  By your second or third episode you'll find yourself following along with conversations that are almost spoken in their own language, from street talk to the terminology used in police stations to the phrases tossed around in political circles. Everything is captured in perfect dialogue and delivered by actors who make it seem like they've been speaking these dialects for years.
If The Wire isn't the best show to ever air on television than it is most certainly the best show to air this millennium. Well worth checking out.",1231977600,,1254,4.800925925925926

Beyond that, what impressed me most is the nuanced, adult approach the writers take to their characters. No-one is perfect and few are perfectly evil. For instance, we first see D'Angelo, one of the central characters, on trial for a murder he plainly committed. Later, he confesses to killing another innocent person. But D'Angelo has a heart and a conscience.
On the police side, we see one cop commit an act of wanton brutality. He is depicted as more than a little stupid. But later he is revealed to have a talent breaking codes and figuring out complicated paper trails.
The ""hero"" is a dedicated detective but a poor husband and father, an occasional drunk and terrible son of a bitch.
One enduring theme is the way drug money corrupts all who touch it -- not just the poor users but also the dealers, the police, lawyers and politicians. Drug money greases the skids of society in this series.

2097957,5,B0002ERXC2,"This is great stuff.  I can't really add to what others have said here, except to say that this is definitely a series to watch.  It's got everything you'd want from a crime drama like CSI, but much more.  The characters are interesting: nobody fits an easy stereotype, and no one is simply a good guy or a bad guy.  There are several overlapping story arcs, but they all fit together in a complex puzzle.  There are hints of many much larger storylines that could be followed up on, but aren't -- it has the feel of a world, the world of Baltimore, unfolding on its own, and we happen to be given a glimpse of some of the interconnected lives of a few investigators  and the ones they are investigating.  But their lives are set against a backdrop of politicians, lawyers, a changing climate in America after 9/11, and much more.

I'd heard so many good things about this series but never had a chance to see it -- now that I've seen season one and am halfway through season two, I am hooked and will be watching through to the end.  There's something about television done right that enables an experience you can't get from film -- stories that begin and end and of other stories that pick up where they leave off; a real sense of character growth that doesn't feel artificial, contrived to fit into a 2 hour window; also the feeling for continuity in character and places, of something unfolding over time.  This is television done right, and it is rare and exciting to see it.  Definitely a show to watch (if you aren't put off by the heavy language, some sexuality, heavy drug-related content, and violence - this is R rated television).",1229558400,,1643,4.47986577181208

Well... I found my exception.  This first season caught me hook, line, and sinker.  The dialogue is not far off from what I hear on the streets 6 years and a couple of thousand miles away.  The networks, lookouts, interviews, interactions between agencies - all of it is dead on (except for the drinkin, carousing, etc...!!!).  If you ever wondered what the guys in the blue jeans and raid jackets really do - this is as close as you can get to a ride-along!!

2097959,5,B0002ERXC2,"The Wire is, at first glance, Yet Another Cop Show, about a group of disparate and conflicted police officers working to bring down criminals who are often not much better than they are. Yawn. However, there are two things that mean that people should take this seriously. Firstly, it's made by HBO who, up to a couple of years ago anyway, seemed physically incapable of making something unless it was absolutely gripping and awesome. Secondly, it's the creation of former police writer and journalist David Simon, whose previous show was the brilliant Homicide: Life on the Street.

The Wire kicks off on the mean streets of Baltimore, Maryland. A murder case against a young black man named D'Angelo Barksdale collapses when one of the witnesses is scared into retracting her testimony. The furious judge learns from homicide detective Jimmy McNulty that D'Angelo is a junior member of a far-reaching criminal gang run by his cousin, the extremely elusive Avon Barksdale. This gang controls all the drug supplies on the west side of the city, and are protected by a labyrinth of legit front organisations. Determined to get some payback, the judge uses his influence to have a special joint homicide-narcotics unit formed to bring down the Barksdale gang, with McNulty assigned and an up-and-coming officer named Lt. Daniels placed in charge.

The investigation into the Barksdale organisation by the unit forms the backbone of the first season of the show, but that's just one side of the story. We also get to see the investigation from the POV of the criminals themselves, most notably D'Angelo as he finds himself free but busted down to supplying the lowest of the estates, as well as the kids who work for him. A dangerous, unpredictable third faction is also in play in the form of the one-man army Omar Little, a criminal whose personal code means he can only steal from other criminals. The police try to form an alliance with Omar to bring down Barksdale, but their erstwhile ally has an unfortunate tendency to blow away the criminals they're trying to get locked up, which makes this a difficult task.

The appeal of The Wire is hard to explain to those who haven't seen it. It's fairly slow-moving (although never dull) in places and arguably takes two or three episodes to really kick in. It's also pretty unforgiving if you miss an episode. Flashbacks to prior episodes are non-existent, and plot points and character and emotional arcs often turn on a single conversation from several episodes earlier. You need to pay attention here. Luckily, that's made easy by the tight writing, the ingenious methods the criminals go to avoid being caught and the even more intelligent methods the police need to use to investigate them, and the acting. It'd be almost impossible to single out any of the actors for praise. British actor Dominic West has the closest thing to a central role as McNulty, and handles the character very well, but Lance Reddick (more recently seen as the enigmatic Abbadon in Lost) holds every scene he's in as the formidable Lt. Daniels. Clarke Peters develops his character of Lester Freamon from almost a background role to that of the most intelligent and confident officer on the team in a natural and impressive manner. John Doman's constantly-infuriated performance as McNulty's commanding officer and eternal nemesis Major Rawls has to be mentioned as well.

On the criminal side of things, British actor Idris Elba (formerly seen as Vaughn in the excellent Ultraviolet) impresses as Stringer Bell, Avon Barksdale's trusted number-two man, and Larry Gilliard Jr. provides the main criminal POV as 'D' Barksdale, as he tries to claw his way back up the organisation amidst growing concerns about how the family does business. For most people - including Barak Obama - the stand-out performances in the show belong to two of the more morally ambiguous characters, namely Michael K. Williams as the dangerously unpredictable Omar and Andre Royo as 'Bubs', a street informant struggling with his own drug addiction. Royo's performance was so convincing that whilst filming he was offered a heroin fix by a passer-by who thought he badly needed it, and later referred to this as his 'street Oscar'.

The cast is uniformally brilliant, the writing is fantastic and the show is, surprisingly, very funny. Whether it's the stories of some mind-bogglingly stupid criminals, or the ridiculous difficulties the team faces at getting a desk into their basement office, or Bubs' methods of identifying suspects for the police observers, the show has a jet-black vein of comedy which gives several laughs per episode. This is necessary because the show can be quite bleak, showing as it does wasted young lives amidst the crumbling tenements of a poor city, and a lot of the characters die in rather unpleasant ways over the course of the investigation. The investigation also ends messily, and the fates of many of the characters is left wide open for the second season.

The Wire: Season 1 (*****) takes a couple of episodes to build up a head of steam and get you into its headspace, but once that's done it never lets go.",1223424000,6,5155,4.946882217090069
2097960,4,B0002ERXC2,"Reality bites. As one of the protagonists' mothers asks in the final episode of the season `what's right?' In Baltimore's narcotic investigation unit it is hard to say. Nearly everyone has a little dirt. Most of the bad guys were just born into doing what they do with no way out but to take a bullet or a stretch on the inside. Narcos bust for headlines to make rank. Dealers are in the game because they have no other way. Judges turn coat because it is election time, money goes missing, burnt out cops get wire tap equipment from the 1950s, computers are like gold and the body bags are mounting up. If you are not drinking then you are on the take. If you are on the take then the guilt of it runs home fast. Baltimore is falling apart and the worst thing about the drug war is that this label is all wrong... wars are something you can win.

The show revolves around Det. Jimmy McNulty, good police who does things behind the backs of his superiors, gets dumped with a bad detail and slowly turns into it a career making case that threatens to rock everyone from the street dealer to Capitol Hill. Within the space of 13 episodes you watch how broken cops build a reliable unit out of nothing and they work the streets to build a case against a residential area's top hoods. This is great drama through and through.

The Wire's got a lot of heart for telling it like it is and this is one of the reasons why this little known show often hits the top 10 best TV shows in the reviews. If it wasn't for the reviewers who know a good TV series when they see one, we wouldn't have a clue this was out there.  Who would have thought that a little unknown knocking around could be a contender? If you like good TV then chances are that you will eventually want to try a few episodes and who knows, you might get the wire bug.

Pros:
- Like the real deal
- Solid police story, good balance of views
- TV drama for men

Cons:
- Only 13 episodes
- Sometimes its low production values are apparent
- Catering for male viewers and is not really viewing material for a couple.
-  You might expect too much with the hype.",1223078400,3,2113,4.217821782178218

2097963,5,B0002ERXC2,"Others have written long positive reviews, so instead of going on about how great The Wire is, I'll just focus on one member of the fictional cop ""cast""...Jimmy McNulty.

Now I am of the opinion that the best TV cop of all time is/was Andre Braugher's Frank Pembleton, of Homicide fame. That belief was unchallenged until detective McNulty came along.

Although his character was slightly watered-down in later seasons of The Wire, Season 1 introduces us to this driven detective in all his uncompromising glory. Witness a police detective that allows nothing to interfere with his single-minded pursuit of justice. Like a doberman with a juicy bone, McNulty is dogged and relentless. He circumvents the chain of departmental command, annoys fellow officers, treats partners poorly, breaks the rules, and refuses to compromise. He's arrogant, self-righteous, a binge drinker, an adulterer, a drunk driver, and a general all-around jerk.

But if he's on the case, you'd better believe it's going down. He'll put his own young children in danger to make certain of it.

McNulty is a mad dog in the Baltimore police department. And he might just be the best cop in TV history (sorry, Frank).

2097964,5,B0002ERXC2,"'The Wire' unfolds like the best kind of novel, full of detail, nuance and memorable characters. And yet it's not a police show. It's an urban tragedy. A heartbreaking commentary on the neglected, marginalised and ignored in American cities. It's about the have's and have not's and the sheer devastation wrought by poverty and drugs.

But it's still a slam bang, unabashedly violent cops and robbers saga, chocka block with intricate plot twists, shocking, often very bloody deaths and some suprising humour.

Set in Baltimore, 'The Wire' show sets up all the cliches of a police drama and then blows them apart with brilliant scripts and a magnifcent ensemble cast that give a richness and empathy not usually seen in this type of show. The actors are simply wonderful.

2097968,5,B0002ERXC2,"Since there are tons of reviews here singing the praises of 'The Wire', I wanted to aim my review at the people out there who are on the fence about whether to check out this criminally under-rated show.

I watched the first episode of 'The Wire' when it first aired, and decided that I didn't like it. To me, it looked like an unfortunate combination of ""Lost"", ""Sopranos"" and ""Oz"". ""Lost"", because as the viewer, you know the characters are never going to succeed, either in getting off the island or getting Baltimore off drugs. I figured there would be a pattern of episodes where the police gain some traction in the drug war, and then the drug dealers would rally, and then the police would come back, et cetera, ad nauseum. ""Sopranos"", because I assumed there would be many bacchanalian scenes where the evildoers revel in their unlimited access to wealth, power, and women. ""Oz"", because it looked relentlessly bleak and violent. I'm not knocking any of those shows, it just seemed to me like 'The Wire' was taking the worst parts of all three.

I reluctantly tried the series again because my friends kept raving about it. And here I am, five years later, to say the hype is true. 'The Wire' may well be the best television ever.

'The Wire' is first and foremost, a superbly crafted story. As others have said, the season is really one long narrative with thirteen separate chapters. This frees up the television medium considerably. Episodes are not themed, do not uniformly end with shocking twists, and don't adhere to any formula of ""primary plotline interspersed with two minor plotlines."" The acting is brilliant, the dialog is razor-sharp, and view of corruption and poverty is unflinching.

Before seeing this show, I have always said that ""Homicide (Life on the Street)"" was the best television series ever made. 'The Wire' includes many of the same elements, but the format - long story arcs and no censorship - take it much further than Homicide ever went.

HBO has also shown an admirable restraint in the depiction of violence. 'The Wire' is a violent show, but most of it takes place off-screen, and some of the most memorable scenes are almost finished before you notice them. In one scene, a dealer stops at a shady-looking convenience store for a late night snack, and literally everything in the store, including the owner, is protected by a bullet-proof sheet of glass. In another scene, children from the projects leave for school with a small bag of chips for lunch. The lucky ones also get a juice box.

I don't know if this show is qualitatively better than the Sopranos, but personally, I enjoy the Wire more. I would say the Wire is less ambitious in scope, but what it does, it does better. Unlike 'Sopranos' 'The Wire' is plot-driven, which means the characters must serve the story. However, character-driven or not, I got tired of being inside Tony Soprano's head after a few years. Tony is after all a banal, violent man. This may be a realistic depiction of a mafioso, but it does begin to wear. 'The Wire' performs that miraculous trick of depicting boredom, pettiness and venality with actually being boring, petty or venal. People and places are ever so slightly larger than life. It's gritty enough to keep it real, while fantastical enough to keep you enthralled.

Finally, the series had the guts to do what almost no other show does: end. The final episode in the season actually brings everything to an incredibly satisfying (though not necessarily neat) conclusion.

I hope I've brought at least one more viewer on board to this truly excellent series. A few last notes:

- Buy or rent the DVDs. You are going to be lost without subtitles.

- Be aware that the dialogue includes an incredible amount of profanity. If that offends you, you will hate this series, all the pros notwithstanding.

- As others have warned, the DVD menus contain spoilers. Be careful not to read the plot summaries at the start of every episode. You can't skip them, so just close your eyes and keep pressing ""play."" Also be aware that some of the commentary contains spoilers for following seasons.

- A lot of people have said that the good guys aren't so good and the bad guys aren't so bad. This is true. However, don't be fooled into thinking that the show is simple moral relativism. A corrupt cop may beat up a suspect; a high level drug dealer might commit a murder. The show is about many things, primarily about individuals versus the institutions they serve. It also makes a lot of interesting statements about the nature of information - what the cops can glean from the criminals, what the criminals figure out about the cops, what the cops hide from each other. To paraphrase the series tag line, everyone is listening carefully.

- On top of everything else, this show is funny!",1217203200,14,4820,4.723809523809524

2098006,5,B0002ERXC2,"New friendships, new acquaintances... just a simple mention ""so, what do you honestly think of The Wire?"" illicits only one of three responses: I love it, I hate it, I haven't seen it. Responses like ""it's boring"" or ""too realistic"" ride under the ""I hate it"" response. If someone says ""I love it"" my affinity for that persons intelligence and personal sense of their place in a diverse and yet mostly unknowable world grows exponentially. ""I hate it"" pegs their life-outlook in the CSI, Law & Order et al mode. Quintessentially myopic in just about every sense of the word. ""I haven't seen it"" immediately brings out the Santa Claus in me as I hand them over my copy for them to ingest, digest, and ultimately get back to me with a measured response. If they come back with the ""I hated it"" they're probably not worth my time. On the other hand, I just got my wife to finally watch the show; she hates those ""f***, f***, f*** n' f***"" shows (as she likes to call them), it took her five episodes to begin to understand what this new beast was. We watched, I saw the light of reality start to dawn on her on just what this was... nothing short of Dostoyevsky's ""Crime and Punishment"", a bit of Hugo's ""Les Miserables"", Dicken's ""Oliver"" - all of which are stunning comments on not only crime, but poverty, and the role that the everyday citizen who turns a blind eye and does not demand accountability from it public service officials plays in the further decline of our society.

Now, I love shows like Rome, I can enjoy the happy romp of BBC's Jekyll, Babylon 5, although sorely lacking in most departments, tells a mythic story, The Sopranos was devious tv that was just damn fun to watch, Six Feet Under showcased that comedy could come from anywhere, but The Wire is something altogether different. It dares to point the finger, it dares to show life in all of its brilliance and all of its ugliness, it dares you as a viewer to actively think about the issues presented while still maintaining a storytellers eye, and it dares you, as a viewer, witness just how good tv can be if its creators have the unrestrained balls to give rise to their finer instincts.",1197504000,5,2165,4.5229591836734695

2098008,2,B0002ERXC2,"I know everyone will hate me when they read my review.  In fact, why would anyone listen to me when almost 92% of the hundreds who have reviewed this series give it five stars?  Well, just my opinion but here it is:

What was expected was that when I started this series, beginning with season one, I was in for a spectacular viewing.  A detective drama set in Baltimore that mixed undercover work, court drama and various themes of humanity.  Does it have it?  Well, sometimes, but the delivery is done with ground shipping, and like the po-boys they try to show in the projects, I end up sitting around on a couch waiting...waiting...

...waiting for drama that never comes.  Waiting for action that is weak, and waiting to strain through the bog of endless office talk.  Perhaps it is in the office where the show falters the most, sometimes having camera shots zoom in on a person for three seconds at a time while they are thinking about nothing.  Then there is the whole thing with the detective using a typewriter.  Okay, did I miss something?  Is this 2008 or 1978 people??  High Profile crime unit using typewriters, sure I buy it and a bag of that counterfeit money they had in the first episode.

I read where someone said the Wire was the Shield ""With brains"", well the intellect may be there but the likeable characters sure are not.  Not in twenty years have I seen a show that has such a weak character development.  The minor details they do try to add to give them some kind of personality, are ultimately just for nothing.  The bad guys are not bad, mean, or scary and the good guys are just plain boring.  Up that with a bunch more office talk where various stiffs wearing suits stand in dark corners trying to act like imposing forces.  Again, nothing there, these characters could be loafs of bread with bright red twisty ties and they would garner more attention.

I'm so glad I just rented this season, I was planning on buying season 2 if I liked the first one, but this has to be one of the worst television dramas HBO has EVER done.  One other thing that adds to the NO ORIGINALTIY section of their accolades from me is the fact they seem to think it is necessary to drop 400 F-bombs every show.  For those of you who don't understand that, it means the F-word, and this show has them throwing it around like its DEADWOOD.  Then again, that show got cancelled after only three seasons.  When is HBO going to produce a drama that is fictional but still plausible, without stripping away every humanistic quality in the process?",1192838400,26,2552,4.48590021691974
2098009,5,B0002ERXC2,"By far one of the best televison shows that has ever been produced.  If you are coming from the world of network television or even fluffy reality shows on cable, the edginess and tough situations of the show will shock you.  But keep watching, and you will soon understand that the education, political, social, and economic issues of impoverished urban areas are not so simple.  And more important, maybe you will soon discover that life is far from black and white, and those that are constantly portrayed as the villains of our society (drug dealers, drug smugglers, etc.) are not as morally incorrect as we would assume.  Sometimes its not about your job, but the enviroment and reasons that cause one to work in that position.",1190160000,,732,4.785714285714286
2098010,5,B0002ERXC2,"""The Wire"" may not be the first cop show to ditch the one-case-per-week standard for one season-long case (""24"" is), but it's the best. Just like a great novel, ""The Wire""'s plot and characterizations unfold gradually (13 episodes) and in great detail, with a more satisfying ending than can be achieved by telling a whole story in just one hour. My only complaint is that the resolution is rushed. They should have taken two episodes to present everything in the last one. It almost ceratainly is the first cop show to give equal time to the bad guys. Both cops and bad guys on ""The Wire"" commit deplorable and heroic acts. Much like Tony Soprano, Baltimore drug lord Avon Barksdale is at times an admirable businessman. Particularly early on he shows a knack for inspiring loyalty and confidence in his employees in a way that would make organizational psychologists proud. It sure doesn't stay pretty all the time, though. Episode 12's climax, the potential inside job hit on a young employee, may be the most gut-wrenching and terrifying moment in television's history. The dialogue on ""The Wire"" is sharp, poignant, hilarious and always authentic. Most of the acting is terrific. Standouts are Andre Royo as Bubbles, a druggie informant with a heartbreaking tale of addiction; and Larry Gilliard, Jr. as D'Angelo, the morally conflicted nephew of Avon.",1190073600,3,1357,4.9823788546255505

2098013,5,B0002ERXC2,"Most people will tell you that their HBO lineup is The Sopranos, Sex and the City, Entourage, Six Feet Under, etc.  Typically, most only know the big hits on HBO Sunday night drama and this little series is almost never heard from most HBO subscribers.  It took me a while before I really discovered this drama since I was following most HBO big hit dramas.  But, I think this series definitely deserves credit for story-telling and character development.  I can only compare this with other dramas on HBO which require strong committment to your Sunday night life and also cable subscription.  Well, that all changed with DVDs which are pricey with HBO compared with network dramas.  I guess that's what you get when you have big budgets with really good dramas.  Recently, HBO has been having deals on their older series so this isn't a problem if you keep your eyes open to Sunday ads.  That's how I got caught into this series and it kept me on the edge of my seat.  Alot of new faces with strong talent makes this drama rolling.  I tried to follow typical crime dramas like CSI and Law & Order but I lose interest fast.  This drama actually has a detailed drawn-out plot which builds up momentum for the whole season unlike your typically weekly show that neatly wraps up the plot that night.  You then appreciate that HBO brought this show to light even though it hasn't gotten the real appreciation from others.

The DVDs are packaged quite nicely like most HBO season sets are typically released.  There are not much frills on this DVD set as most TV DVD releases, but that's fine with most people who have little patience to sit through commentaries and deleted scenes.  The image and sound are crisp, and that's what matter to most people.  Simple menus make it easy for most to skip between scenes and browse through episodes with summaries and previous episode summaries.",1185667200,,1883,4.66060606060606
2098014,5,B0002ERXC2,"The first season of The Wire takes us through pararell stories of law enforcement and criminals in Baltimore surrounding a single murder/drug case. It unravells itself in a way some have compared to a novel, each episode being like a chapter, and this is litterally unlike anything I have ever seen from a television series, and it's just a joy to watch. It covers the investigation in such a detailed, muliviewed way that I felt if I was a part of the community. There aren't cliffhangers or satisfying hollywood conclusions at the end of most episodes, but I was eagarly awaiting every next episode because I was drawn into the story and characters and needed to see what will happen next. The cast from top to bottom is outstanding (no major stars, just character actors), and I won't bother trying to pick a few favorite performances as that would just be too difficult.

The Wire is brutally honest in dealing with it's material, which may be a reason it hasn't gotten the recognition it deserves from the likes of the Emmys. People in law enforcement are human, and some are corrupted, while others bend the rules a little bit here and there when it's convienent. The police are not all these rightous crusaders like many television shows depict; in the end it's a job like anything else. It's not a bash on law enforcement at all though; in fact there are great moments of redeption for a few characters. On the criminal side it deals with shades of grey, some being just bad and others victims of their circumstance, but none are thrown under the train as being completey inhuman. The big enemy on the show seems to not be the cops, and not even the criminals, but the beauracracy and the highers ups with political motives that impedes justice.

If you've never seen the show do yourself a favor and get this first season. Chances are you'll get hooked. I think it may be the finest example of television ever produced.",1185148800,3,1928,4.6345029239766085
2098015,5,B0002ERXC2,"If you're like me, you never caught The Wire on HBO in any of its original, low-rated airings, and you heard - through critics, friends, in passing - that it was something akin to the Great Dramatic Series no one had seen, but you never quite wanted to get yourself hooked.  Well, I held out for years, and when I finally got to watching The Wire's critically acclaimed first series, I still had no idea what to expect - a bonus, perhaps, of the low ratings: even its best secrets remain hidden.  Like The Sopranos before it, The Wire creates such a rich web of characters and subcharacters, respects so thoroughly its creation of place and environment, that it takes no time to become absorbed in each brilliant, bristling detail - the show comes roaring in with ""The Target,"" and by episode 2, ""The Detail,"" we're already so entrenched in the reality of events, when a full-scale police-incited riot breaks out, it feels like the most natural, long-time-coming event that could have happened.  The Wire bristles with personality, by every character involved - Dominic West's drunk, egotistical, brilliant McNulty that leads his crew of detectives - the magnificent, moral Greggs (Sonja Sohn), the stalwart Lester (Clarke Peters) - is interesting enough, but he's the least interesting character considering the astonishing crop of personalities and performances that play out amidst the beaurocratic and street-led turmoil of the Baltimore streets - The Wire stands as such an accomplishment because its drug world is as vivid and corrupt as its police world.  In that, the personalities on the street - chilly, calm Stringer Bell (Idris Elba), confused D'Angelo (Larry Gilliard Jr.), smart, innocent Wallace (Michael B. Jordan) - become as absorbing as the world they inhabit.  Each unexpected, nuanced plotline flies in the face of ordinary - or even recognizable - TV convention and lets the conflicting humanity of these personalities jut up against their world, and simply lets us be mesmerized by their results.  I'm thinking of the plot thread that follows Bubbles, the heroin-addicted snitch played fearlessly by Andre Royo, who, in one astonishing scene at an NA meeting in ""One Arrest"" shows, with a mere flicker of his eye, his buried desire to live.  Where the season follows him from there is an indicator of everything this series does right - creates and fulfills the humanity buried in every corner of a dying city.",1184889600,3,2433,5.007425742574258

Needless to say, I was totally blown away by the acting and actually didn't think my regular viewing of episodes of Law & Order SVU were as good anymore.  Watch this show and you'll see what I mean by the exceptional acting on this show. It could have something with being allowed more creative freedom from being on cable as opposed to network TV but it is that good. Watch the first three episodes at least. It hooks you in with the behind the scenes street drug dealing and the police work and wire tapping that go behind the case to try and bring the dealers down.  A MUST have!

2098019,5,B0002ERXC2,"It's no wonder this series hasn't caught a massive audience. It's intelligent, it doesn't depend on cheap theatrics and easy hooks, it asks viewers to think for themselves, it refuses to run clich&eacute;s and stereotypes, its characters are often amoral or ethically flip-flop just like real people, it doesn't hand over the story in neat little bites, it relies on small beats of emotion to redirect the narrative arcs and it absolutely will not make any allowances if you miss something important. When you add the methodical attention to detail in police work, the unfiltered slang used by the gangs, the unremitting bad language, the use of drugs and the occasional splashes of genuinely unpleasant violence it really is a winner. Oh yeah, and it takes its time and goes really slowly as well.

If reading the above you think it's a description of TV hell then goodbye. Don't let the door bump your backside on the way out. On the other hand if it rings any bells with you, then you have to got to watch this. The closest thing I can compare it to is...nothing else. There's never been anything quite like it. I read someone else here use the word genius and I think it is. It's a novel written for TV.

A word of warning, though. I was in episodes 5-7 before I started loving it. Up until then it was appreciation then it all clicked into place and I went back and played the whole thing from the start.

Also the 2nd and 3rd seasons are even better but you need to begin with season 1.",1182643200,5,1492,4.498154981549815

For those of you who have never ventured into an inner city with a drug and crime problem this show will put you in the drivers seat. One small thing, you will be safe from the realities that others live in daily that are depicted on The Wire. The next three seasons are just as great with the fourth being one of the most powerful ones. When that comes out, keep in mind that its not entertainment it's real life drama.

Granted, it's absolutely worth seeing, so I'd encourage anyone interested to keep your eyes peeled for a sale, a used copy, or a price drop.

2098024,5,B0002ERXC2,"I am really picky and critical about what I watch, but I consider The Wire Season 1 to be a masterpiece. To give you an idea of my tastes, one of my favorite movies is Insomnia with Al Pacino. This show is even better than that, and you get to enjoy it for a whole season, not just 2 hours!

Everything rings true. The dialogue, the plot--everything. The plot and dialogue remind me of the movie Crash at times, only this is less over-the-top.  It has lots of philosophical symbolism, but unlike Crash it  is presented subtly rather than by beating you over the head with it.

 The suspenseful moments are the most suspenseful I've seen in anything on screen.  Because it is a serial, there is time for a complex plot and complex characters to be developed. You get to hear the bona fide dialect spoken by many African-Americans in the DC-Baltimore area where I live, and the vocabulary is not dumbed down for a general audience as you would find in most movies. You get the real thing.

Lastly, the director does something I wish more directors would do: he dispenses with music for the most part. Many directors use music as a crutch for making the audience feel the emotions they are supposed to feel in a particular scene. Here, the emotional reactions are induced by good acting alone, and it works. Watch this show. You won't regret it.",1175472000,8,1342,4.520661157024794
2098025,5,B0002ERXC2,"I have long thought that some of the best stuff on TV can be found among HBO's Original Series.  I'm a big fan of some of HBO's better known dramas including Rome and The Sopranos, as well as of some lighter fare such as The Ali G Show and Curb Your Enthusiasm.  Strangely, I'd barely even heard of The Wire until very recently, when a friend of mine (who generally has very good taste) was raving about it.  Up until then, I hadn't given The Wire a chance, which was a mistake.  At his suggestion, I purchased Season One on DVD.

I won't waste much time going into what The Wire is about, as that info can be found elsewhere.  For those who don't know, it's about an under-funded, under-manned, rag-tag group of police officers going after a fairly sophisticated, deep-pocketed, and well connected network of murderous drug dealers in West Baltimore.  While this general theme (underdog cops vs. powerful criminal organization) might not sound all that original, the series is extremely well executed.

This is likely not an original opinion, but I think what really sets The Wire apart is its realism.  Granted, I'm an upper middle class nerd who's lived a coddled life, so I may not be the best qualified reviewer to comment on the realism of a show about drug dealers in the West Baltimore projects, but to me it achieves realism in a way that many if not most television (as well as big screen) dramas fail.  It isn't over dramatized.  The cops look and generally act like cops (they don't look like models and they live in crappy apartments, for example).  The ""bad guys"", similarly, look and act like rational participants in ""the game"" would be expected to.  The character development is excellent, and as a viewer I related to (even rooted for) characters on both sides - in fact there are both protagonists and antagonists on both sides.

The Series does begin a little bit slow, but this is necessary in my opinion due to its complexity, so be sure not to write it off too early.  I'd guess that, had I been forced to rate The Wire after say, 3 episodes, I would have awarded it about 3 stars.  After 6 episodes, 4 stars.  But around episode 8 or 9 or so, the intensity really builds up and the plot lines start to unfold FAST.  It's well worth the time invested in the first, slower half of the season, in my opinion.

I'd consider The Wire one of the best dramas in recent memory, and I'd definitely recommend buying, renting, or borrowing the Season One DVDs.  I would note though that, due to the general complexity of the Series, it's likely you'll want to go back and watch some (or all) episodes more than once, so the DVDs are worth purchasing in my opinion.

As for the ultimate endorsement, will I be continuing the Series?  You bet, I'll be ordering Season 2 on Amazon soon after I submit this review.",1175126400,16,2823,4.515748031496063

2098029,5,B0002ERXC2,"""The Wire"" is further evidence that HBO has produced some of the best television ever shown in the States.  Whether ""The Wire"" is better or worse than other hallowed series such as ""The Sopranos,"" ""Band of Brothers,"" or ""Rome"" is immaterial - this series is, without hyperbole, magnificent.  Creator David West and co-writer Ed Burns, along with the rest of the bunch, deserve all the praise heaped upon them.

Essentially, ""The Wire"" is a cop show set in Baltimore.  The drug trade is ruining this troubled city - not for nothing does Episode One open with a cop cynically discussing the fate of a dead kid with a local, and then follow it up with a murderer being acquitted because a witness has been bought off.  The lone witness who testifies is murdered almost immediately thereafter. A frustrated cop, McNulty (Dominic West) discloses to the judge that a local drug ring led by Avon Barksdale (Wood Harris) is operating with impunity, including buying off and murdering witnesses.  The judge authorizes the titular ""wire"" - wire-taps on project payphones - to nail Barksdale.

The judge also raises a beef with the police force, a close-knit, regimented fraternity where rogues like McNulty are despised.  So, to keep the judge happy, the cops assemble a rag-tag squad of cast-offs and rejects, stick them with the basement, and assume the investigation goes nowhere.  But thanks to some stellar detective work, the wire starts to produce results.

So far, so good. That's all to be expected in a police procedural.  But what elevates ""The Wire"" is that we don't just see the good cops tracking down the bad drug dealers.  We see the dealers and those who live with them in all their humanity.  There are good guys who deal drugs in Baltimore because that's all they have done for generations.  Adding further spice to ""The Wire"" is the rampant corruption of Baltimore police and politicians.

""The Wire"" keeps the viewer jumping from plot-line to plot-line, which include such varied threads as a dealer struggling with his conscience, a cop fighting for visitation rights to his kids, a trigger-happy cop learning while on suspension that he's got a gift for data-crunching, a dealer forced to work with the cops to avenge his murdered lover, and a druggie struggling to clean himself up.  None of these plot lines is forced to walk a straight line, but all are allowed to bob and weave through the characters' lives.  Through it all, ""The Wire"" remains true to itself, and no notes ring false.

Here's looking forward to Season Two.  If you have a significant other who will get frustrated with your dedication to this series, just watch the first episode of the first season, and you will both be hooked.  And grateful.",1173744000,2,2729,4.8405172413793105
2098030,5,B0002ERXC2,"One of the best series on TV. Runs at least neck and neck, I think better then the Sopranos.
The characters are fascinating and complex. Some of the best story telling and acting I've seen in a long time. The characters personalities are compelling and captivating. You just get hooked.

I was a Soprano's snob. I just felt it was the best thing on TV and safely tucked away in Jersey so I didn't have to think about the crimes affecting my life.

Before I viewed The Wire, I guess I didn't want to be bothered with the whole urban crime thing, especially so close to home. I felt like what on earth could these kids, with pants hanging down to there knees and rap music blasting have to say that's intelligent?

I found that the crime hierarchy is so much like the Sopranos, organized to the point of being genius. I found just like the Sopranos there is a Family like element, but a brutality that is unbelievable.

There are characters you will love but know they are paid to kill. Characters you find ultimately ruthless almost with animal cunning. Then you will find some characters eloquent in there lifestyle and speech.

Among the characters in Season One, a young dealer who lives in a condemned building with about 6 little elementary school kids. He buys food for them and sends them off to school. He's lost with no parents like those kids. The show isn't preachy in any way. It just is.

Also The Wire is about both sides of the coin. The police officers, politics, and lifestyles are just as riveting. Cops that drink too much, have an awful family life, fighting with ex's, or not giving a damn.
It's outstanding.......

I think it's not as popular as the Sopranos because there aren't a lot of big time stars in it although there are local actors and cameos by some well known artists.

The first season of 'The Wire' did, it is a groundbreaking (I won't use that word more than once I promise) realistic well-casted story of a police department's special CID squad (detectives from different divisions) and their crackdown of drug-dealing and murder in the projects of West Baltimore. HBO went to great lengths to not make this show a carbon copy of other attempts at drama (Oz). The roles of career-hungry detectives with differnt agendas are played by actors whos' styles are as varying and attachable as their characters. The show moves along quickly with surprises and a perfect script, you can never predict what'll be said or who will return to the screen at any moment. The Wire shows three sides of the same coin, showing the measures and affects of the SINGLE 13 episode story when politics, careers and police procedure collide. Its not a new story every episode, its one complex but easy to follow road with dozens of side-streets in every hour-long episode, accompanied by perfect performances by actors you've never seen until now. The casting is excellent, the dialogue is raw and real but if you had a bunch of celebrities peppering this show it would lose its' authentic feel.

2098041,5,B0002ERXC2,"This show was recommended to me by somebody from Baltimore who was familair with the city and the problems they are facing.

He claimed that the point that differentiates this show from all the other police shows was the in-depth look at all the particpants in the urban drugs scene, from the street junkie up to the policy makers in Town Hall without having the cliche good or bad label stamped on the characters.

And man, was he right. The characters are extremely realisticly played along with a classic story line of a police investigation but with a very contemporary feel to it. This show is educating you on how people are influenced and react to their environment and it makes you understand -even if you don't agree - why and how people become what they are.

The show has some scenes with hard violence but this is very well timed and perfectly fitting within the context of the story line and is not oversensationally bloody.

In the beginning I was a bit shocked to hear so much explicit language by all the chararcters but at least it did not feel as overacting. In the end you get used to it but I listened with headphones on to avoid that my kids would listen in on the language.

In general the lingo used is very authentic (xtreme street slang and police jargon)and was for me most of the time hard to follow all the dialogues but this also gives the show it's extremely raw feel.

I worked around this issue by watching the show with subtitles on.

I have seen the second season as well and the directors/creators succeeded in keeping everything realistic (no romantisation of the characters) and of a extremely high level (casting is superb!).

For me this is the best police show on TV and that is coming from a diehard NYPD Blue fan!",1168387200,6,1755,4.514195583596215

At times I wish I could only get HBO and forget the rest of the channels.  Well... I kind of got tired of the writing in Sopranos, luckily Deadwood provided me my fix.  That is until a friend of mine told me to check out ""The Wire"".  What? I vaguely recall seeing previews for it, but had never watched an episode.  But out of my respect of my friend and HBO dramas, I decided to give it a shot.  After 1 episode I was intrigued,  2 episodes I was hooked.  After finishing the first season, I was desperate to get my hands on as much of this show as possible.  There is nothing else like it on TV.  Like others have said, this is not a cop show.  The Wire is an unapologetic view of the entire food chain of the drug trade in inner city Baltimore.

There are plenty of other entertaining shows available, but nothing that might make you rethink your worldview the way The Wire does. Season 1 starts slow, as it is responsible for introducing an incredibly deep cast of characters; however, you will be hooked after three or four episodes.

I recommend this show to everyone, but many people are hesitant and assume it is just another crime drama. Part of the problem in convincing people to watch it is that it is too deep to quickly explain all its strong points. Give it a shot and you won't be dissapointed.",1167004800,3,672,4.508196721311475

I didn't find the first episode of The Wire compelling when it first aired on HBO but I picked up the first three seasons after watching The Corner while bored and rather liking the story but really liking the emotional arc of the story. The Wire in its entirety is wonderful so watching all the episodes is better than piecemeal so starting this show/acquiring all the episodes has to be a leap of faith.

I hope everyone is fortunate enough to watch this show because despite the cursing and the use of the N word, these characters good and bad show that human life is very precious and deserves the utmost respect.

This series compels repeat viewing so tape off of hbo if you can.

Is this frugal?  no but I feel strongly that this show must be watched and is the best thing I have ever seen - better than Buffy, South Park or Justice League; it actually shows you why you must be good as a matter of social responsibility

I watch the Shield and I've seen NYPD Blue and Law & Order the CSI's and what I'm saying is that this is easily the best cop show out there.  I was unaware of this when I first started watching was that another great Baltimore cop show, Homicide: Life on the Streets, were both created and written by the same guy, David Simon.  What is really cool is that they get a lot of fairly unknown actors or even amateurs to play big roles for this show, and that it works.  Check this show out.",1163030400,5,717,4.056737588652482
2098052,5,B0002ERXC2,"Over the last two decades I've watched a great deal of television, maybe even more than the average for my generation, and out of all of it The Wire is doubtless the most challenging and important show I've ever seen, leaving even other classics like The Shield and The Sopranos in its dust, and this first season remains its defining document.  All thirteen of these episdoes are filled with amazingly detailed and complex storytelling, sharp characterization, and endless insights into the nature of modern crime and punishment--and they're mighty exciting to watch, to boot.  The whole season covers the participants in a single case, as an impromptu squad of cops is assembled to bring down the housing-project drug empire of Avon Barksdale and Stringer Bell, but the implications of the investigation, and the show's ambitions, stretch far beyond one tiny front in the interminable drug war.  We watch the case, built almost entirely on electronic surveillance (hence the title) come together piece by piece from the ground up, with the emotional stakes and social relevance being ratcheted up consistently along the way, right up until a harrowing conclusion that takes up the last two episodes.  Watching the Wire, one thing is certain: Law and Order this ain't; you'll be thinking about it a lot longer afterward.

Even if nothing else, season one of The Wire would be notable for its narrative structure, which represents a new twist of the serialized TV format-the visual novel, with everything connected, so an event that happens in one episode can be referenced seven or eight episodes later and the viewer had better know what's going on.  The season is deliberately structured in a novelistic format, with individual episodes making up the chapters, so watching, say, the ninth episdoe of this season will get you nowhere except a state of abject confusion.  Thanks to its narrative flow, the Wire is easily the most naturalistic show I've ever watched, as the progression of events from the season's beginning to its end never feels forced or contrived.  This format demands a lot of the viewer, as it practically requires you to watch nonstop without blinking or looking away from the screen, but it proves so rewarding you'll probably want to anyway.

That having been said, I can actually understand why this show's viewership is so limited (and it is REALLY limited; check the numbers).  For many, The Wire will probably be so lifelike and believable that it doesn't even function as entertainment.  In that sense, the show's greatest strength is also its (only) weakness, as there's nothing remotely sensationalistic or cliched about it, no reliance on overdirected action scenes, contrived cliffhanger endings, or improbable plot twists, which right away separates it from pretty much everything on network TV.  For all involved, the season is filled with setbacks, frustrations, and long periods of waiting for something to happen, just like real life.  The action quotient is also a lot lower than you'll find on a show like The Shield, and what violence there is is frequently disturbing, but it's always employed with a purpose, rather than just for the sake of mindless entertainment (make no mistake, I'm not opposed to a little mindless violence from time to time, but The Wire makes far more effective use of it).  The world is made to look as and feel as real as possible, as though you're actually there-no dream sequences, no haunting visions, only one extremely brief flashback-an emphasis on realism that extends to the most seemingly insignificant bits of setting and dialogue.  It all adds up to a show that's unfailingly convincing and authentic, but definitely not for those looking for an escape.

Hmmm, how else can I count the ways in which The Wire wipes the floor with its competition?  Well, for another thing, the scope is just so much wider than any other crime show's, going far beyond even The Shield (a great show, but still an also-ran in comparison to The Wire) in capturing the workings of an American city in the early 21st century. David Simon himself has said the show's principal focus is on how institutions affect (and are affected by) individuals, and The Wire casts a decidely unflinching light on the functions and dysfunctions of the groups it examines.  Anyone who's part of an institution-in this case a police force, a court system or a large-scale drug organization-has to compromise his individuality to a certain extent, and the show perfectly captures the conflicts that come with the tough decisions the real world requires of its characters.  The only truly independent character on the show is Omar Little, the freelance street operator who makes his living robbing drug dealers, and he has to make the tradeoff of constant threats on his life.  The world of The Wire is a difficult and unforgiving one, where having a conscience can get you killed while someone infinitely more vicious walks, and where conscientious cops can lose out to those who know how to play the game.

In yet another break with convention, there's no Tony Soprano/Vic Mackey/Greg House-style main character here around whom everything is required to revolve, at least to some extent-The Wire is about the story, and while the characters are hardly interchangeable or inconsequential, the emphasis is on fitting them all into the whole universe the show inhabits.  That said, everyone depicted in this season, from the junkies and street dealers to high-ranking cops and politicians inhabiting halls of power, is played brilliantly.  Although there isn't really a main character per se, Dominic West is sort of a first among equals as Jimmy McNulty, the self-righteous, insubordinate, irresponsible detective who turns the case into a personal crusade to prove his superior intelligence and frequently succeeds.  For all his flaws, Jimmy's a man's man, the kind of guy you can't help but like, especially since he really is smarter than pretty much everyone else around him.  After West, the biggest impression among the wire team is probably made by Lance Reddick as Cedric Daniels, the almost impossibly intense, glaring leader whose initially suspect dedication steadily grows over the course of the season.  Backing them is a whole crew of memorable characters, from the odd-couple pairing of loutish white detective Herc (Domenick Lombardozzi) and his smooth black partner Carver (Seth Gilliam); to Jimmy's trash-talking, cigar-chomping partner Bunk Moreland (Wendell Pierce); to paternal, wisdom-dispensing ex-homicide detective Lester Freamon (Clarke Peters); and of course abrasive, venal Major Bill Rawls (John Doman), who manages to save his best vitriol for Jimmy.

Unlike the typical crime drama, though, The Wire's focus doesn't stop with the cops, providing a ground-up view of the inner workings of the Bell-Barksdale drug operation, from the lowest street dealers to the two leaders.  The wire team's targets aren't just plot devices, nor are they slobbering, inhuman evildoers; rather; the Barksdale-Bell Crew are just as sharply drawn and fleshed out as anyone else, with an operation whose corporate structure and intricate business practices are just as pure a distillation of American capitalism as any legitimate company's.  The incredible Idris Elba, especially, leaves an impression as Stringer, the smooth, highly intelligent, and icily calculating lieutenant who oversees Avon's operations, but he's hardly alone.  Wood Harris is all intensity all the time as Avon, while Larry Gilliard Jr. as Avon's conscience-stricken nephew D'Angelo captures all of his character's emotional conflicts without any undue melodrama.  As a whole, the experiences of the Bell-Barksdale crew provide a sad commentary on the lives of unwanted blacks in housing projects nationwide-many of them have the intelligence and motivation to be doing other things, but isolated from the mainstream of society there's nothing else for them to do.  The game is all they have, whether they want to be involved or not.

So, yeah, that's pretty much it.  The emergence of TV as a respectable medium (especially in comparison to the movies) over the past decade or so has been well documented, and The Wire is definitely one of the shows leading the charge.  The show's subsequent seasons, while indisputably brilliant and still better than pretty much anything else out there, have watered down the show's formula just a little bit as they branch out in all sorts of directions, but no matter.  This season stands alone as one of the decade's crowning visual achievements.  Easily worth the time and money you'll invest in it, especially for how much time you'll spend thinking about it afterwards.",1161820800,524,8738,5.158527954706298
2098053,5,B0002ERXC2,"Unlike the Amzon.com editorial review I don't think the wire hooks you after the first episode, actually I think it's like that with both the first and second season. The beginning episodes actually may turn some people off of it but you have to keep watching. Everybody starts out swearing way too much, I mean they can't go three regular words without swearing and your trying to figure out why the cast looks so dumb and why you can barely understand them. You have to push yourself through the first couple episodes to get to the real quality episodes and that's when you're hooked. Not only the cast does a great job but also the writers did a great job of basically knowing Baltimore in and out. They have the slang, the accents, the attitudes, and the gritty drug and political wars right on point. I've been to Baltimore myself but I have never seen the other side of it and that's where it all goes down.

The Wire shows the intelligence of Baltimore crime and the fearlessness of all the little soldiers doing the top dogs dirty work on the good guys side and bad guys side. The acting is real and it is so good that they make you believe that they're the characters they're playing. You sure won't find a love story in the wire because everybody wants money, respect, and respect. The story is great because you don't truly know who's good and who's bad like Stringer Bell played by Idris Elba who is the right hand man of Avon Barksdale, Barksdale is basically running Baltimore's drug dealing and all the crime possible. In reality Avon would have been caught if it wasn't for Stringer who is a genius, he goes to school for business and takes all the dirty money and makes it untraceable by buying all the property he can. The funny thing though is that none of the property is in either Avon or Stringer's name so if they ever get caught nobody can touch it.

In a way you could say that Stringer is a street savior because he's buying up property and making it black owned but the process of getting the money to do it is killing the young and old people in the community. Stringer is one of my favorite characters but my absolute favorite is Omar played by Michael Kenneth Williams. Now I have to admit he is a little hard to get used to especially when you find about his not so well kept secret, Ok I'll give you a hint, he went to jail and got out liking not having a girlfriend. Omar is also sort of like a street savior because he's one of the worst types of stick up kids you could ever run into. He robs the drug dealers and he takes everything possible. Plus Omar is the cat that gives that extra gun slinging action to the series because he fears no one and even crazier everybody fears him. The wire is a very addictive series and so I suggest watching it on a weekend and if the first few episodes turn you off a little please don't stop watching.",1160524800,4,2875,4.342007434944238

2098055,5,B0002ERXC2,"The Wire reaffirmed my faith in television as a legitimate artistic medium.

The Wire is not only socially-relevant and important, but also brilliantly acted and written. The complexity of each character makes it difficult to make easy distinctions between ""good"" and ""bad,"" which is a remarkable feat in any medium (be it tv, film or literature), and even more remarkable given the polarized times that we live in, and network television's tendency to ""dumb-down"" shows with overt-dialog, flashy editing and melodramatic background music. The Wire's enormously-detailed story fills in the nitty-gritty aspects of criminal justice and doesn't overlook the tedium, uncertainty and difficulty of actually bringing someone to court AND pinning charges on them---this is crucial, given the one-dimensional, fits-in-a-perfect-box, glossed-over, formulaic nature of most network cop and court shows.

One stand-out character is Omar (Michael K. Williams), the Robin Hood-esque vigilante who robs drug dealers. Omar's understated, sophisticated dialogs and clear-eyed morality (despite his chosen ""profession"") make him a classic character, in addition to a complex one. One can't call him a ""good"" guy as he operates outside the law and has no loyalties. His character is representative of the complexity and brilliance to which The Wire aspires---other shows would forgo such a character, in favor of simpler dichotomies between good and bad, cop and druglord. Omar represents a bizarre middle-ground, and one that no doubt actually DOES exist in the real world of the urban drug trade.

D'Angelo (Larry Gillard Jr.), a ""lieutenant""-grade drug dealer, also shines as a portrait of a conflicted, tortured individual. He recognizes the violence and immorality of his job, and questions it continually; he makes mistakes, but accepts his punishments as a form of penance, which is in-line with his sense of right and wrong. He is a drug dealer, but one who abhors violence and has a melancholic, near-nihilistic philosophy about his own life, even while he encourages other youths around him to shun the drug trade.

Season One of The Wire is a masterpiece. It frustrates the viewer without providing easy answers; at the same time, it is realistic and honest because of its attention to the harsh truths of the world. In real life, not everything works out perfectly. The Wire recognizes this grim fact and turns it into a riveting, artistic, heartbreaking examination of urban poverty, criminal justice, politics, drugs and race.

The Wire is simply unprecedented and stunning.",1158364800,25,2571,5.4175
2098056,5,B0002ERXC2,"The creators of ""The Wire"" have taken great care to bring to the viewers a crime drama that is unmatched in reality.

There have been many great crime series on television such as ""Law and Order,"" ""Columbo,"" ""N.Y.P.D.

Or if you're not completely lose, you're at least unwittingly cheating yourself out of *so* much. (2) Be patient.  This is like a novel and they're setting a whooooole lot of things up, so if you're the type of person who puts down a 500-page book if you don't like the first 25 pages--this show is *not* for you.

As an aside, I think any negative reviews can be explained by either (1) lack of patience/lack of interest in a show in which you really have to invest yourself [this show simply requires more from the viewer than other shows], or (2) lack of interest in realistic television [yeah, it's gritty, for sure... a ""warts and all"" view of things).  ""The Wire"" doesn't just deal with sexy topics or glamorous untouchable characters--it's about crime and violence and racial politics and decaying American industrial cities and the disappearing blue collar middle class and trying to do ""good"" in the face of overwhelming odds and family in all of its incarnations, and a *whole* lot more.

So many other reviews discussed the phenomenal writing, acting, and overall production quality, but those deserve a mention, too.

Seriously.  If you give it a chance, ""The Wire"" might just change your life (or at least your perspective).  I always thought that kind of a statement was ridiculous hyperbole (it's TV, for cryin' out loud), but then I saw this show.",1154822400,12,1760,4.715686274509804

Why?  Because it takes full advantage of the medium.

How?  By filming a book.  The writers demand you pay attention.  Episode seven may refer to episode 1, bypassing 2-6.

Who?  The creator is a long-time Baltimore journalist.  His collaborators are some of the finest crime fiction authors in America.

Where?  BALTIMORE.  There are few works that so completely inhabit their setting.  You'll see what I mean.

I tried the Sopranos, and was not throughly impressed.  But, as somebody else said, this is like a detailed novel, with all the nuances of sight, sound and clarity.  It's like a visual smack in the face from every direction.

Nobody lays off in this series.  Nobody.  Not the criminal, the street cop, or the sophisticated detective.  Everyone has an angle, and every one is bucking for a promotion, from the street hood, to the tenured Police Litenuit.  It's a dog eat dog world, and nobody is going home hungry, or so it seems.

Call it what you want.  I call it brilliant television, you may call it HBO?

Complaints:  Too much cursing.  Okay, we get it already, It's HBO, you can curse with four letter words.  No censors.  We get it!  Doesn't mean I want to hear the F Bomb, 7 times a minute.  And when you watch the show with subtitles, you see the actors ad-libbing a lot and throwing in extra F Bombs, not in the original script.  So, apparantly, they are being told to throw in what they want, and worry about editing later.

And this is my common complaint for most HBO original programming, so all fault can't be thrown on the shoulders of The Wire writers.  For that 4 stars.

Other than that, no other complaints.  Great show!

2098066,4,B0002ERXC2,"""The Shield"" is now my gold-standard for cop drama. Relentless, fast-paced and great. HBO's ""The Wire"" is not nearly as breakneck as ""The Shield,"" but it is wholly engaging in a very different way.

""The Wire"" draws you in slowly, putting the story together piece by piece as a detail of Baltimore police come together to target a West Baltimore dope dealer who has been operating under the radar. When one of the dealer's lieutenants beats a murder rap in court by intimidating witnesses, Det. Jimmy McNulty ends up griping to the case's judge about it. The judge complains to the higher-ups in the police department, and pretty soon everyone in the Baltimore PO-leece (as they pronounce it) is mad at McNulty for sticking his nose where it doesn't belong.

On top of that, when the detail expands its focus to follow not just the drugs, but the money, the case's tentacles start to reach into some high places...

What I enjoyed most was the way the show detailed the various workings of a wiretap operation. As one character puts it in the second season, to a detective who feels there isn't enough action on this case, ""We're putting people in jail using wiretaps and typewriters.""

The show also takes a frank look at the West Baltimore drug trade -- ""In this town, what other crime is there?"" one detective asks -- from the higher-ups down to the street-level teenage dealers.

The focus in particular on the young crews that actually slang dope was interesting. One storyline, which examines the way a baby slanger feels in the aftermath of having been responsible for the torture and death of a neighborhood rip-n-runner (a stick-up man who robs drug dealers) at the hands of his crew, is a pretty powerful tale.

The show is chock full of memorable characters, from the suits who run McNulty's homicide unit who are pretty much totally concerned with the unit's clearance rate, to (I believe) Wendell Davis' portrayal of the hilarious and drunken Det. Bunk Moreland, McNulty's partner (there's one scene in which Moreland and McNulty, surprised at what they find in their recreation of a crime scene, use only the 'f' word for about five minutes.... hilarious), to Omar, a -- no joke -- homosexual rip-n-runner, who robs people with a shotgun, gets many of the series' funniest lines and somehow manages to inject some tenderness into a very icy character.

The ending doesn't have the slam-bang excitement that a lot of other season finales do, but then again, it's probably more indicative of the way cases like this really do end: you don't nail everyone, and a lot of people walk away unhappy.

It's very realistic, and still consistently very entertaining... a hard balance to strike, but HBO and creator David Simon have done it.",1146528000,7,2744,4.81104033970276
2098067,5,B0002ERXC2,"All the other reviewers have expressed my views on this extraordinary series, on any level it is hard to fault, story, acting, direction, casting, locations, music and even background sounds are just right but I think it's worth getting a copy of 'The Wire' (ISBN 0743497325) book.  Having watched both series more than once I really wanted to know more.

The first two series have a complete plot synopsis, a listing of the cast and crew, black and white and color photos, several key characters/actors get their own pages and there is plenty to read about how the series was created and why.  Some quirky stuff includes a chapter called 'The Legend of the Yellow Sofa' and 'The Insider's Guide to the Cast'.  The city of Baltimore gets a chapter: 'Mayor to The Wire: Drop Dead'

You can get the book really cheaply from several Amazon Marketplace sellers.",1146355200,5,857,4.763513513513513
2098068,5,B0002ERXC2,"A lot of detective shows are from Agatha Christie land. That is a land

in which the police are upright and good and in which wrongdoers lack

moral quality. A land in which the solving of crime is an intellectual

exercise carried out by the superior mind. CSI is a modern example of a

show coming from Agatha Christie land, skilled crime scene

investigators, police and public prosecutors work to bring fiendishly

cunning wrongdoers to justice.

The Wire is from somewhere else all together it is from reality land.

The opening to the Wire is a murder trial when an open and shut case

collapses because witnesses have been bribed. A judge asks a homicide

investigator what has happened following the end of the trial. What has

happened is that a new gang has moved into the public housing areas and

taken over the illegal drug trade. This gang has carried out at least

ten murders and beaten three homicide charges. The Judge makes some

calls to try to get an investigation started into the gang.

The response from the law enforcement agencies is one of outrage that

they have been required to do some work. A number of police are

released

from different departments who are seen as incompetent by their bosses.

(Why lose a good officer to some other agency who will get the praise

for what they do and not you.)  The new task force is told to make some

cosmetic arrests and to wind up the operation. The original homicide

investigator who tipped of the Judge is called McNulty. He is

immediately seen by his superiors as a trouble maker who is distracting

them from doing what they like to do which is clear up homicides. Close

the file and give it to a DA but not be really concerned if there will

be a conviction or if the gang who carried out the hit will be closed

down. McNulty wants to do things and must be leaned on.

The series is remarkable as it must be seen as a whole. The episodes do

not stand alone well and what makes the series good is the portrayal of

the dynamics of the operation and the reality of dealing with serious

drug crime. Over the series each of the members of the unit is affected

by what they are doing. Some who are have been incompetent start to

learn the complexity of serious police work. Others who were wrongly

sidelined are able to demonstrate their skills and the depth of their

knowledge. Others just fail and fall by the wayside.

This is only half the story. One of the key attractions of the series

is the realistic portrayal of the drug trafficking gang. No cardboard

cut out villains like in Agatha Christie but characters who have been

dealt certain cards in life and know how to play them. Violence and

murder are the key to survival and the running of the gang. Yet some of

the characters have a certain nobility. Of course to achieve

significant

evil gang members have to have sufficient skills to lead and inspire

their followers in what they do. If they have no skills they would be

ineffectual criminals.

The quality of the writing in the series is outstanding. Watching this

series (I saw half of it during a weekend) one realizes the hackneyed

nature of so much that passes for crime fiction. The dialogue is great

and the characterization is such that one is drawn to all the

characters

even the most flawed. It is hard to think of a better police series.",1144627200,20,3359,4.495016611295681
2098069,5,B0002ERXC2,"I'm another one who loves this series. It's as intelligent and credible and complex as everyone says. I love that the filmmakers respect us as the audience, respects the skills of the actors and the work of the writers and even respects the criminals that are so much a part of the story. If you like your crime dramas one-dimensional this is not going to sit well with you. There are times when you really quite like some of the bad guys and when you despise some of the ""good"" guys. For this viewer, at least, that feels like real life.

Watch this if you like dramas like Homicide: Life of the Streets, Deadwood, Six Feet Under, The Sopranos. I know those are all quite different, but they're at the same high level. Actually, I think The Wire is better than any of them. Ever watch The Sopranos thinking that this is pretty good stuff but that you're kinda getting tired of seeing these creeps commit random acts of violence? I felt that way through the four seasons of the series that I watched. But The Wire never feels gratuitous. It's never violent or sexy just to titillate the viewers.

This is the best real life cop drama out there, in a whole different league than the glossy CSI stuff. Highly recommended. And if you do start it stick with it. The series builds slowly, picking up steam as we come to know the characters over time and as the plot becomes ever more complex.",1141516800,14,1387,4.435294117647059
2098070,5,B0002ERXC2,"Hard for me to top some of the more laudatory comments already made about this program set on the hard, seedy streets of Baltimore, but I feel as if I should try in this particular instance, as I seldom, and I do mean very seldom, have anything positive to say about the current state of TV, and that includes Cable-TV. Invariably, it panders to the lowest common denominator, it celebrates puerility and all that is execrable about humanity, and it unalterably infects our cultural atmosphere like some pestilential miasmic cloud of banality. This superb dramatic series, a singular exception to that nearly-uniform and depressing rule, is almost enough to restore my faith in the integrity and power of the creative process. I've never been a cop or a criminal, but I can't imagine any dramatic representation more realistic, or gritter, than this. There's no facile moralizing, no craven simplifications, no easy solutions offered, no stalwart cardboard saints pitted against stereotyped dark-hearted sinners. The ""hero"" of this show is a self-destructive, alcoholic detective, portrayed by the talented Dominic West. The ""villain"" is Russell ""Stringer"" Bell, a quietly-charismatic, cold-blooded drug-lord portrayed by the equally-talented Idris Elba. While Bell can certainly and unambiguously be classified as ""evil"", Elba is able to invest the character with a nuanced, complex humanity that, if anything, makes him even more terrifying than he might otherwise seem. As for the other roles, there isn't a bad actor in the ensemble, and the idiomatic dialogue is reminiscent of the better novels by George V. Higgins. Those involved in the creation of this show, to their great credit, assume that their audience is comprised of intelligent, thoughtful adults, and proceed accordingly. The result is a masterful TV-series that will surely restore the faith of those like myself who have become jaded and refuse to believe that anything significant or worthwhile can be produced in our contemporary culture...that includes movies, books, and music, much less TV. For these discriminating audiences, ""The Wire"" should serve as an exhilerating epiphany.",1140739200,10,2155,5.397626112759644
2098071,5,B0002ERXC2,"Television today is polluted with cop shows, whether they are reality ones of the same name, or one of the many spin-offs of Law and Order or CSI, only with specific twists that attempt to make the series unique. Problem is, there are at least three spin-offs of each of these series, so uniqueness is obviously no longer there.

That's where The Wire comes in. This show has elements of all of the shows above but actually does it with a sense of reality that only HBO can achieve. Cops swear, and drug-dealers talk in slang. These things you just don't here on regular TV because of censorship. Not only that, but HBO has a gift for creating huge casts to cover all aspects of a certain story without bogging down the flow of the story or becoming confusing (see Oz and Deadwood). The story in The Wire follows a group of hastily brought together police officers, detectives, and undercover agents as they attempt to bring down Baltimore's biggest drug kingpin using wire taps and hidden cameras. On the opposite side of this fight, the drug dealers range every where from the simple messenger to the leader himself. Then, there are the inbetweeners, such as the ""Robbin Hood"" who robs from drugs from the dealers and sells it to other dealers to gain favors, the dopers, the kids surrounded by this mess, and the women of the dealers. When brought together, it makes a cast of characters too many to count, but by the end of this season, it's easy to distinguish each and every character.

Another great thing about this series is the realism. Anyone who lives in a neighborhood where drugs prevail will feel a pang when watching this show. Cops can be corrupt and cops can be good-guys, while the drug dealers can be the same way, bad or good. What distinguishes them is the choices they made or were forced to make in their pasts, and the side of the law they are on when they break the law. Those who live around this know this well, and will find the realism of The Wire stark indeed.

I can't recommend The Wire highly enough. It easily the best cop drama on TV, and if HBO didn't have so many other great shows appearing on DVD and on their channel, I'd say that it may well be the best show on TV. Either way, it's damn close. Get this if you loved The Wire when you first watched it on TV, or if you just want to see something different. Chances are, you'll sit down and want to watch the whole thing because of how addictive it is.",1140393600,7,2443,4.412416851441241

2098073,4,B0002ERXC2,"HBO produces The Wire, $79.99 US, which is an original drama that I've only recently discovered. The Wire is the creative vision of David Simon and Ed Burns, and skilled writers like George Pellecanos have even been caught contributing to episodes. The thing I like most about The Wire is this, it doesn't condescend to the audience. The plot is fairly intricate for a one hour drama, and there are many different characters to follow, actors to keep track of. Also, the show is fairly realistic in its portrayal of a months long investigation, wherein criminals engage in deadly but lucrative turf wars, and hard working cops face mean-spirited reprisals for simply doing their jobs. People that live in Baltimore will especially enjoy this show, since it's the setting for the drama and exteriors are shot here. There are also some good inside jokes that people from Baltimore will understand, such as when a detective holds up a Laura Lippman paperback.

I was able to check out The Wire: The Complete First Season on DVD from my local library, otherwise I might never have reviewed it. Surprisingly, many DVDs (Desperate Housewives, Mr. & Mrs. Smith, Sex in the City, The Forty Year Old Virgin) can be found at the library, especially boxed sets, so I'd suggest you check out the online card catalog (and interlibrary loan & hold) at your local branch before you blow your meager paycheck at the nearest Blockbuster. If you like audiobooks, you can find many of these at the library also. Some of the actors that headline The Wire are: Dominic West, John Doman, Idris Elba, Frankie R. Faison, Larry Gilliard, Jr., Wood Harris, Deidre Lovejoy, Wendell Pierce, Lance Reddick, Andre Royo, and Sonja Sohn.

Each episode of The Wire has (as an added feature) audio commentary from the writers, and it was fun to go back and listen to the commentary after watching each episode. If you don't speak english, you can listen to each episode in French or Spanish. Deaf viewers can follow along with English, French, or Spanish subtitles. The run time is 775 minutes, so I'd suggest setting aside a rainy three day weekend for maximum viewing pleasure. If you lose track while switching between disks, you can review an optional Previously On... or Next On... trailer for each episode of The Wire. The video is clean and vibrant, displayed in a 4:3 aspect ratio. The DVDs featured no biographical information about the actors featured in The Wire, so disappointingly I cannot tie names to all faces. I think all the acting was superb.

Although I love the theme music by Blind Boys of Alabama, I didn't enjoy having to sit through (or click through) the show intro 13 times. When you have the whole season in a box, I think one intro is enough. I'd rather have had a short audio bumper inserted in front of episodes 2-13, and the front end credits replaced with title cards on the back end. 41 whole minutes could have been carved out of the run time if the intro were removed from 12 episodes, and this might have allowed HBO to squeeze the season onto four discs instead of five, eliminating the overdone packaging in the process. I think the actors deserve more credit than I can accord them here, because if there were any paper booklets or inserts that were supposed to accompany the box set -- well -- the library must've removed them from the slipcase. Below find a single summary for the best episode of this boxed set. Enjoy viewing!

DISC 5

Episode 12: Cleaning Up

After Barksdale's supply gets confiscated in the bust, Stringer hands down new rules to the crews. Barksdale and Stringer meet with Levy to discuss their next steps, which includes the elimination of any and all persons that can connect Barksdale to the drugs. Wallace returns to the pit and asks to get put back on the crew. However, Stringer has other plans for Wallace, and asks Bodie to step up for the job. The actor that plays Wallace is absolutely phenomenal.

Indeed, as other reviewers may have noted, the full essence of The Wire may not appeal to the intelligence-challenged, quicky-dicky bang-bang shoot-'em-up mentality of persons that find it a bit of a chore to think. But if you've ever experienced the joy and exilaration of just having finished reading a good book and leaned back with a smile and a whispered, ""WOW that was good!"" you'll understand why I enthusiastically took other reviewers' hearty advice and just purchased the complete SECOND season of The Wire also.

Just a brief over view of the 13 episodes is what I'll give you (each coming in at around 55 minutes).  It starts as mid-level drug dealer, D'Angelo Barksdale beats a murder rap. After a conversation with a judge, Det. James McNulty has been assigned to lead a joint homicide and narcotics team, in order to bring down drug kingpin Avon Barksdale. Avon Barksdale, accompanied by his right-hand man Stringer Bell, enforcer Wee-Bey and many lieutenants (including his own nephew, D'Angelo Barksdale), has to deal with law enforcement, informants in his own camp and around town, and competition with a local rival, Omar, who's been robbing Barksdale's dealers and reselling the drugs. The supervisor of the investigation, Lt. Cedric Daniels, has to deal with his own problems, such as a corrupt bureaucracy, some of his detectives beating suspects, hard-headed but determined Det. McNulty, and a blackmailing deputy. The show depicts the lives of every part of the drug ""food chain"", from junkies to dealers, and from die hard cops who are all about heir work, corrupt cops and brownnose higher ranking officials to clean and dirty politicians that lead to a very deep and compelling tale of the corruption, life and more then all, the truth in the city,  David Simon (who has been the main force in a few other great series' set in Baltimore The corner, and tv drama Homicide) brings this great tale to life and this may be the best series I've ever seen on TV!!!!!

It's that good.

I was a fan of the show ""Line of Fire"" on ABC, but it was eventually cancelled (strangely, their web page is still around at [...] Reviewers had panned the show, saying that it was a weak imitation of ""The Wire"" on HBO (I don't subscibe). So, when I was in a local video store and found nothing that interested me that day, I noticed a copy of the first DVD from The Wire box set for rent and picked it up - the store had split the box set and was renting each DVD separately.

All the characteristics that other people here have pointed to are evident from the very first episode, and it only gets better. By the time my wife and I had rented the second DVD in the set, we knew we were going to purchase the complete set because it was *that good* and something we were going to watch more than once.

We later bought Season two (also wonderful). Now I'm eagerly awaiting the release of Season Three, and was glad to hear they are working on production for Season Four.

One example: they don't use music to tell you what to feel about the scene. (I didn't even notice until it was mentioned in the commentaries.) I am pleased about that, for I get irritated when a show or film plays ""scary"" or ""romatic"" music to manipulate you. It just lacks subtlety. Not so on The Wire.

The show is based to a very high degree on the experiences of police in Baltimore. One of the co-writers was a cop for 20 years.

Simon was a journalist in Baltimore who developed both of the above books after spending months as a sort of ""embedded"" journalist with the homicide detectives of the Baltimore P.D. and, later, with the people on the front lines of the drug war. ""The Wire"" is far more slowly paced than other shows in the sense that each season forms a story arc, with no single episode wrapping up many details. Each episode, however, opens up the characters' lives a little more, following the detectives and the dealers and the drug addicts as they pursue and elude each other and one another.  To appreciate ""The Wire"" you need an attention span and the will to use it. This is not entertainment rinsed of realism and grit and presented to you in a sterile, cotton-padded package with a pretty little bow on top, and that's why it's such a breath of fresh air.",1123804800,7,1172,4.607655502392345
2098083,5,B0002ERXC2,"Wire is not just another Police TV show. It's not glamorous. It's very realistic, just the way you would think real cops are: human, sometimes corrupt and without ""ultimate justice' perception that expressed in American television. I recommend it strongly. I suggest seeing the DVD, since translation is essential for those who are not expert in jive (and I'm not).",1122422400,7,365,5.1
2098084,5,B0002ERXC2,"Homicide is still the finest cop series of the last 15yrs, but The Wire has to be up there. It's a change from other HBO series like the Soprano's and Six Feet Under in that the story is the thing - The Wire is meticulously plot driven, rather than the obvious familial focus of Sops and SFU.  Therein lies the shows appeal and its curse - the viewer needs to give 100% attention to actually follow the game and its players.  That is not to say the characters are inconsequential, there are brilliantly flawed people on both sides who are crucial to the story - but not more important than the story.  The Shield may be good entertainment and can tell a gritty story - but The Wire values persistance and smarts over pistol whipping and muscle. It is one of the few series to tell both sides of the crime story fairly evenly - hell Deangelo Barksdale is almost a sympathetic character, and poor Wallace - well you'll have to watch to understand - it's all in the Game.",1122336000,7,968,4.366666666666666
2098085,5,B0002ERXC2,"The tagline of this series is 'listen carefully'. Indeed, that couldn't be more apt. What with the preponderance of characters, the street-smart 'ear' of the dialogue and the lack of typical 'get-up-to-speed' moments, I had to watch this with the subtitles on just so I could keep up.

After what some may perceive as a slow first episode, this series sweeps you away with its slew of characters and storylines. Its realism prevents the series from ever taking the easy way out, and with its focus on both the drug-dealing end as well as the narcotics squad end, we learn that no one side has it easy and both come up against opposing forces from within. The cops are ruled by a political hierarchy and judicial red-tape; the drug-dealers are ruled by opposing dealers, CI snitches and the constant need to reshuffle their operations to stay ahead of the police.

Perhaps the most appealing feature of this show is that there's no 'shocks' in the 'Sopranos' or 'Shield' nature of the word. There's hardly any violence, and all of the 'action' comes from the incendiary dialogue between the characters. There's a lot of bad language and drug abuse, but certainly nothing gratuitous.

What must be remembered is that it takes a few episodes to really get into. Pay close attention to the dialogue and make sure you don't miss anything. If you give it the start it deserves, you won't be disappointed.",1120953600,13,1398,4.768595041322314
2098086,5,B0002ERXC2,"I don't think this is the best show on TV. I still reserve that for 24. And I don't think this is the best that HBO has done. I still hold out for ""Band of Brothers.""

But ""The Wire"" is so close that you may not be able to tell the difference. Wire has great acting. Obviously, Domic West is fantastic as the self-abusive but brilliant and committed Det. McNulty. But the supporting cast is equally extraordinary. Andre Royo as the on-again off-again snitch/heroin addict does such a perfect job you believe you're on the street with him. I mean 'on the street.' And Sonja Sohn as Greggs, the gay, compassionate, tough undercover cop is equally up to the task, talking the talk and walking the walk.

It lacks the breathlessness of 24 in the sense that each episode does not leave you gasping. On the other hand, there's an aspect of 24 that's incredible. You can believe that characters 'would' act that way given the circumstances. It's just that the circumstances seem unrealistic. Not so with ""The Wire."" You're right in there in a Pelecanos or Lehane novel - two of the writers on ""The Wire"" by the way, overhearing the street talk and feeling the heat. Brilliant stuff for television. This is what TV should have been doing all along, instead of the garbage they put on ABC, CBS and NBC. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury",1120694400,7,1320,4.565400843881856
2098087,5,B0002ERXC2,"Until recently I had believed that the Shield was the best police procedural currently in production and the Homicide:  Life on the Street represented the pinnacle of the genre.  After watching the first season of HBO's the wire I now understand that I was mistaken.  This is not to say that the Wire is necessarily a superior drama to the Shield and Homicide, but it is definitely better at the realistic portrayal of both criminals and police.  In particular the Wire's portrayal of systematic corruption; as largely entrenched, petty and venial; is unique and resonates with anyone who has had to operate within a bureaucracy.

The wire is also unique in its story-telling method.  The season revolves around a single police investigation, with point of view perspectives (and major protagonists) on either side of the law.  Everyone is flawed and conflicted.  Even the best cops are either self-destructive alcoholics (McNulty) or on the take; and the criminals range from the chillingly ruthless Stringer Bell; to the conflicted D'Angelo; and the poetic professionalism of Omar.  This is a true ensemble cast, given great writing and a seamless, season long arc to work with.  As other reviewers have commented, this a novel that was written for television as you must watch it from beginning to end to get the full impact.  There is a feeling of great immediacy and authenticity throughout the production.  I give the Wire Season 1 my highest recommendation, particularly to anyone who is a fan of Homicide, the Sopranos, the Shield, Boomtown or any other dark, character driven drama with great writing and season long story arcs.",1120176000,6,1637,5.044609665427509
2098088,5,B0002ERXC2,"The reason why I still watch HBO, the Wire (and Real Sex) but the Wire is basically a gritty urban drama in the same vein as Homocide, however you get multiple points of view, one from the cops, the politicians and the drug dealer. In this case the main villian is Avon Barksdale, who is the top kingpin in a family run drug empire. You have a squad of police officers and detectives out to bring down his street empire through use of the wire (tapping public phones and business offices that Barksdale and his associates use). Yet Barksdale isn't some young thoughtless moron. He has the IQ boarding genius level, and he's got public officials and people in high places in his pocket. Taking him down or even putting a dent in the drug traffic on the Baltimore streets will take more than just a few simple arrests. What I like about this series is that there really isn't a line between good and evil. Meaning that there is actually a very deep human drama, real acting going on here. I haven't seen much of the second season but if it's anything like the first season I can't wait to check it out.",1119916800,3,1100,4.397058823529412
2098089,1,B0002ERXC2,"I had 1000's of hours of viewing movies, television series, and television programming behind me before I sat down to watch this series on DVD, season one, the box in my hand.  I was very dissapointed.  This series stinks.  I watched only episode 1, and have the experience and perception to know that it won't get any better.

The story settled in episode 1 on 3 places - a rundown, neglected inner city lower class neighborhood, the offices of the detectives, and it goes back and forth between a courtroom and the street busts of drug dealers from vans and unmarked cars.

I didn't like the profanity.  It went on for too long, filled every one's mouths, and didn't have a point to it after the first 40 minutes.  Everyone was swearing and cursing and it bored me.
I got bored with it.  It didn't help to develop character or story and offended me after having it fill my ears for 40 minutes.

The profanity was so thick in the first 35 minutes I got bored.  I coulden't understand what anyone was saying to each other because of the broken english, cursing and swearing, and lude and immature banter everyone engages in.  In short, I coulden't follow the story.  If gangster talk and street slang wasn't worse enough, the profanity and constant cursing just filled in the rest of the dialogue, it felt like the scriptwriters got bored with developing character and story.

Realistic depictions of the life, the neighborhood and what the characters do could be done in less time, with less coarse language, and with more skill. Slow motion, some music, careful planning of the shots, some better storytelling, and the same messages would have come across in half the time.  Obviouslly, the people behind the show lack that kind of talent to pull it off.

If watching cheap white trash and cheap black trash destroy themselves and probably each other interests you, this is for you.  I have a better way to spend my evenings. I experience enough negativity in the world on a daily basis, that I don't have to put it in my dvd player after dinner for it to ""entertain"" me.

I am looking for to getting Season 2 sometime next week because this is really, really good and I would like to see what happens next. The character that stood out the most to me was, OMAR.

Everyone and their momma feared OMAR because OMAR didn't play. He carried around that sewed-off shotgun and he knows how to use it. When he first came on the scene, I didn't like him but as it played out, I got a liking for him. He is ruthless.

The first set is about a drug-related murder case in Baltimore in which the police, while trying to solve it, discover a huge web of corruption and greed that goes right up to the top.

I'd heard a lot about the series and had even caught an episode or two while vacationing in Atlanta back in the spring of 2002. Even then, I knew that this series was so intense, I would need to see it from episode one through to the finale, to really know and appreciate what it was all about.

Well, I wasn't wrong. After two episodes I knew there was no way on earth I was waiting 13 weeks to see how this one panned out and this DVD box set is probably the best thing I've ever bought yet, no exaggeration. I watched three episodes a night and within a week, I was hungry for more. David Simon and his crew and cast are nothing short of geniuses and I have never seen TV with such intelligent writing and realistic character development. I cannot wait to get my hands on series two. It's back on TV in July but thanks to amazon (and my multi-regional DVD player) I don't have to wait until then.

Oh, and I took additional pleasure in the knowledge that both Dominic West and Idris Elba are from this backwater known as the United Kindom (God save the Queen). How about that?!",1113868800,10,1259,4.241666666666666

Although a gritty crime series, parts of this are hilarious, especially when you know the personalities involved. When McNulty sticks it to his boss by a pure display of brilliant detective work done with the secondary purpose of embarrassing the department brass, I felt like cheering.

  The language here is very rough, but the series transcends it.  There was one completely brilliant scene, where two detectives do Sherlock Holmes-caliber detective work on an old crime scene using only photos and a tape measure, and the only dialog for the extended 5 minute scene is ""F***"" and occasionally ""Motherf***"", yet it worked perfectly.

2098095,5,B0002ERXC2,"Yet another hit from HBO who seems to have discovered they're better at developing movies than the movies they typically buy to show on the network.  The Wire is one of the finest things HBO's done.

The dual perspective - working both the drug dealers world and the law gives it a distinctive edge lacking in even the best television crime dramas.  It does the impossible, making you care about the criminals and putting the law in an often unflattering light, exposing infighting, career move climbing, backstabbing and corruption by those enforcing the law as much as those breaking it.  Everyone is revealed in the myriad complexity that humanity is.  Nothing so simple as black and white here.

Everything about The Wire has the feel of authenticity to it - and with good reason, it was written by masters of crime writing in the real world.  The cast is remarkable down to the smallest of roles.

The quality of the screenwriting, the seemingly obsessive penchant for realism, the brilliant direction and the low-key acting combine into a series of the highest quality.  The dialogue fascinates.  And some of the best lines are spoken in low-key fashion without any fanfare.  This is a series that gives its viewers an amazing amount of credit.  Whether it's the language peculiar to the street, the drug dealers, the police, the lawyers or the politicians, no explanations are offered for the vernacular that is used.  There are no visual or musical ""billboards"" screaming, ""Big scene coming up."" The series and its plotlines simply unfold and leave it to the viewer to figure it all out.

With that last point in mind, I have to warn those who are used to being cued by hamfisted directing, writing and acting as to what to expect next.  ""The Wire"" makes you put in your work as a viewer.  But you'll enjoy every minute of it.

Unfortunately, I found the show far too complicated and confusing to follow along via the regular television broadcast schedule.  The DVD set remedied this for me quite nicely.

The Wire is much more sophisticated than those other shows, and unlike any other cop drama I've seen on TV.  It goes into detail about the conflict between the Major Case Unit and the Barksdale drug gang.  It portrays the administrative hurdles the cops face in order to get warrants, as well as the behind the scenes politics that ultimately open and close big cases.  It treats the drug gang with no less attention, showing the individual drug dealers and their struggles all the way up the ladder.

Its critical to watch these episodes in order because its easy to get lost.  The dialogue is filled with cop and drug dealer jargon, and the connection between one scene and the next isn't always apparent.

When you watch The Wire, you get a unique window into our cities and ourselves as Americans.  It's a disturbing view.  The Wire depicts a society that does not care about the hundreds of murders that happen in a place like Baltimore each year and that actually wages war on its own people (the underclass).  It reveals a place where the empty promises of politicians echo in the city's thousands of vacant houses and abandoned factories and where people excluded from our society's economy struggle to be included and to fulfill their own version of the American dream.  In short, The Wire lays bare the reality that our cities have become something utterly unrecognizable to many of us, and sadly irreparable.

Contrasted with the apathy and decay of these urban surroundings are the characters that give us hope.  They come in many guises:  drug addicts trying to get clean and reform themselves, drug dealers attempting to make themselves into legitimate businessmen, and cops struggling, against all their own personal faults and institutional limitations, to do their jobs the right way, even if no one outside of their department cares.

For any hope of understanding what is going on, you have to watch a whole season (the whole series for that matter) from beginning to end (some episodes twice). This is what has captivated me. There are no contrived, cockamamie introductions of characters or storylines. As a viewer, you are dropped in the first episode of the first season with no explanation of who the characters are or what they are doing. They already know and it's the viewer's job to figure out what is going on.

The storylines are complex and abundant and all of them are interesting. A storyline may be initiated in one episode and not touched on again for three more episodes or the effects of a storyline may not come to fruition for several episodes.

I was not disapointed it would be the best cop show ever, except it is far more than your everyday tale of police tracking down the bad guys. The Shield showed us complex characters like Vic Mackie, but in The Wire every character, even the minor ones, have more than one side. The drug dealers are shown to have a human side with one of them looking after a group of little kids and making sure they go to school with their lunch. Another drug dealer feels uneasy when a witness against him is murdered and another struggles to shoot a mate when ordered to do so by the boss. The cops are also shown as real people. The main character, if this show can be said to have a main character, is a boozing adulterer who uses his children to trail the bad guy. Another is also a boozing adulterer but a good cop.

The Wire is in the 2000s what Hill Street Blues was for the 1980s. A quantum leap in TV drama.

The acting is outstanding with the prize going to Clarke Peters as Detective Lester Freamon, a good detective who rediscovers himself after 13 years in a dead end job. Also watch out for Sonja Sohn as Kima Greggs a lesbian cop who is as tough as the men and far brigher.

This series requires work on the part of the viewer, you have to go to the HBO site and refer to the cast of characters to understand. The language is difficult at first but after a while becomes poetic to the listener. I just cannot say how profound an effect this program has on the viewer. It is worth 10 times what I paid for it.

I also purchased the behind the scenes book ""The Wire: Truth be Told"". I am typically a ""been there, done that"" person.  If I have seen something or read something once, I have no need to repeat the experience. However, this is not true with this show. The  DVD box set has renewed my interest ten-fold.  When I watch episodes from season 1, I am always astounded by what I missed the first time.

2098117,5,B0002ERXC2,"""The Wire"" has done something that has never been done before on television. It has taken a look at a conflict between different groups of people, and done so in a manner that brings about understanding, and feelings of compassion for all the characters involved. Rather than moralizing, and encouraging the viewers to root for one side over the other, ""The Wire"" encourages the viewer to take the wider view, and be disturbed by the tragedy of all the characters being involved in the conflict in the first place.

  While the show very much causes one to feel compassion, and even love for its individual characters, the focus of the show is more upon the larger societal dynamics that create the situation all the characters find themselves within.  The show explores the pathos of a corrupt political system, an utterly broken and dysfunctional police department, a drug organization that ultimately destroys its members' lives and everything they hold precious, and so many lost potentials and lives wasted to drugs. You get the feeling that all the characters are trapped in their life roles in ""The Wire"", and you're able to gain at least some vague understanding of what the forces are in our society that create those roles.

  From the subject matter of the show, you might think that ""The Wire"" would be pessimistic and depressing to watch, but I feel that it is really uplifting and offers hope to us as a society. If the viewer can feel forgiveness and compassion for D'Angelo Barksdale, a man who has helped to cause a lot of suffering, then maybe they can begin to feel some degree of forgiveness and compassion for themselves, and those around them. ""The Wire"" makes the world a less scary place. It helps us to understand a lot of disturbing stuff in our society, and maybe even helps us to begin to understand what a solution to our problems might look like. ""The Wire"" looks at all of its characters as if through the eyes of a lover, and sees how they are beautiful; in doing so, shows us how we are beautiful. The show helps us to value ourselves, those around us, and the world we live in. It is truly a profound honoring of life.

2098118,5,B0002ERXC2,"My perspective is that of someone who grew up in one of NYC's most drug and violence infested neighborhoods, while being the son of an NYCPD Narcotics Detective.  One of my closest friends became a major coke dealer in both NYC and Baltimore.  I have rubbed elbows with significant players in the Mafia.  I also went on to become a lawyer.

With that as background for my opinion, ""The Wire"" is the best and most realistic drama I have ever seen.  More realistic than ""The Sopranos"", ""NYCPD Blue"", ""New Jack City"", ""The Godfather"", and everything else that has sought to depict drug trafficking, policing, or organized crime.

Get it!  Watch it!  Believe it!",1098403200,33,658,4.761061946902655
2098119,5,B0002ERXC2,"How can I title this review such? The writing is the first reason. You could have the same cast and general storyline with terrible or sub-par writing and have an instantly forgettable show. With the writing of the first season of The Wire, not to mention the second or third seasons, we are practically giddy as we experience these characters uttering these masterful words and performing their acts. We do not instantly forget but are left with impressions that will probably never leave us. Who will ever forget D'angelo's lecture to the young dealers about the man who came up with the chicken mcnugget? The second reason would have to be the realism. We get the feeling that while we know that this is fiction it COULD be real. The mean streets of Baltimore as interpreted by David Simon, et al. What differentiates this from other shows of its kind? A drug dealer is a person. A real person with problems, heart, and at times extreme intelligence. Take Stringer Bell, a drug kingpin who takes college economics classes to better his drug business. Also take D'angelo Barksdale , a man who doesn't like his underlings to treat the junkie customer with disrespect, as a dog.

In an article I read not too long ago about the third season of The Wire the show was described as a novel (each season) cut up into chapters (each episode). Don't think that you can start in the middle of the season; you might as well start in the middle of a novel. This series is a show for the thinking person. You must be willing to invest your time and mind. Don't expect it to be simple; do expect to enjoy the mental ride.

How can I truly put into words how great this series is? After you watch the first episode you will be hooked. If you are not hooked by the end of the first episode when D'angelo Barksdale is walking away from the murder scene of a man intimately related to him and you see the look on his face then this show isn't for you. If it is then keep watching and enjoy the unfolding of the story of the Barksdale crew and the special police detail trying to bring them down.",1098057600,97,2080,4.4281984334203655

You can't just pop in the disc and expect entertainment without investing your full attention.  This has the depth and detail of a well-written novel and I find myself watching each episode multiple times to absorb the nuance of the storytelling.  I cannot praise this show enough.  David Simon has amde a commitment to not dumbing-down his content, but it's a two-way street and you can't expect to catch little snippets of the show and understand what's going on.  However, some of those little snippets are worth the price of admission themselves.  Also fun to watch considering that two of the leads, Dominic West and Idris Elba are Brits, but they speak Bawlmer-style without a hitch.

I can't say much more than anyone else already has about how truly remarkable ""The Wire"" is. It is, hands down, the best show on television. Ever. Thoughtful, intelligent, gripping storylines; imperfect, at times villainous, yet utterly compelling characters; and a critical, unflinching, yet oddly empathetic view of the city, its inhabitants, and the flawed bureaucracies that keep the wheels turning. The highest compliment I can pay ""The Wire"" is that it is the only show I have ever seen that actually respects the intelligence of its viewers. No, it does not make things easy for us. There are no standard TV devices such as flashbacks, awkward expository dialogue, or stock characters mouthing predictable, socially relevant drivel that ""educate"" us as to the creators' intentions - instead, we get pure, unadulterated story that dares us to make sense of everything ourselves and forces us to form our own opinions and conclusions instead of having them spoon-fed to us. It is a brilliant, brilliant effort, and although it is - typically - underpromoted and underappreciated by HBO, I'm kind of glad about that. I'd hate to see what would happen if stupid people got ahold of it and forced the writers to dumb things down to accommodate them. I'd prefer to keep this show a little secret among smart viewers rather than have it get ruined by too much attention.

So, if you're a dumb person please ignore this review and go watch Law & Order. But if you're intelligent, inquisitive, and a good judge of quality TV - what the hell are you waiting for?? WATCH THIS SHOW.",1096934400,17,1612,4.87956204379562

This first season was great, and the second season managed to be even better.

The best thing about this show is that it turns every part of your brain ON.  You  can't watch it after you had a couple beers and are ready to doze off in front of the TV.

Because so many of the characters are African-American, it may not be embraced by America as ""The Sopranos"" has been, but it should be.

This show is full of grit and realism, as was its excellent predecessor ""The Corner"" (done by some of the same producers and with some of the same cast).  Here the bleakness that we saw in ""The Corner"" is made more palatable, and more interesting, by contrasting ""the game"" with the machinations of the police on the other side of the line.  As with ""The Sopranos"", very bleak stories can be told, and made extremely entertaining, through great character development and through brilliant use of dark humor.

Definitely the most underrated show on television, and one of the great series currently running.

Even though there are many characters, every one of them is developed so thoroughly and skillfully that you identify with each and everyone of them. The more you watch, the better you get at understanding the lingo used by everyone.

As a warning to people who have not watched The Wire.  It can be quite violent and the language can be very harsh.

2098137,5,B0002ERXC2,"I am not prone to exaggeration when it comes to talking about films and television because I've seen a lot of excellant work in my life (television especially has improved a great deal), but I firmly believe that it would be nearly impossible to make a better television series than ""The Wire"". I never thought it would be possible to top ""Homicide: Life on the Streets"", but ""The Wire"" has done that in spades in my book. In part it's because David Simon learned a great deal from observing ""Homicide""'s adaptation to television and he's gotten better at his craft (the HBO miniseries ""The Corner"" he wrote after ""Homicide"" is also excellant, and a few actors that later appeared on ""The Wire"" debuted in that series).

But beyond that, unlike when ""Homicide"" was on NBC with all of its attendant prime time restraints, ""The Wire"" is an HBO production, which allowed for much more realism (it's ridiculous to depict drug dealers saying nothing harsher than ""fudge"", as is the case on network crime shows) and at the same time, less pressure to 'throw in a steamy love story' or one of those other network conventions.  It does make one wonder how much better ""Homicide"" might've been had it been a HBO series back in the day.

It was obvious by the first episode of ""The Wire"" that it had the same great qualities of ""Homicide"", and it was even richer. I thought after the first season of ""The Wire"" that it was inevitable that the second would disappoint, as was the case with ""The Sopranos"" and ""Six Feet Under"" on HBO (two series that have primarily disintergrated into adult soap operas), but amazingly, ""The Wire"" got even better in its second season. Now, with the additional writers Simon has enlisted to help on The Wire's third season (including Dennis LaHane, author of Mystic River), added to the already impressive Richard Price (author of Clockers), it seems likely that the show is just going to get better. Hopefully the Emmys people will finally take notice (though, as David Simon said recently, he already knew from ""Homicide"" that the best way to get ignored in the television world is to film a show in Baltimore).

It sounds like the Wire DVDs will have some great extras- which are much appreciated, since the DVDs of David Simon's also excellant ""The Corner"" didn't have any.",1095120000,12,2299,4.72568578553616
2098138,5,B0002ERXC2,"I caught the wire during its debut run on HBO, and have been hooked ever since.  I feel a lot better about paying my HBO bill each month, just knowing that despite poor ratings, HBO has stayed behind this series, and renewed it for its (upcoming) 3rd season.

I could throw out a list of adjectives to describe The Wire, and still not do it justice... it simply operates at a level just beyond anything that has ever been done before in series television.  There is of course Dominic West as Jimmy McNulty, the self destructive detective at the center of the Wire, a performance so admired in the entertainment business as to have turned the journeyman Brit actor into a bonafied A-List Movie star.  It's no surprise that West keeps coming back to the series.  But what's really amazing about The Wire, is the depth and complexity of its vast number of characters, routinely confounding your archetypal expectations about who these people appear to be.  There is no black and white in The Wire, only shades of grey, and that's what makes it so compelling.

For many series, this alone would set The Wire apart, but what elevates it to greatness is its in depth exploration of crime, drugs, urban ghettos, politics, greed, ambition, and the people who each in their own way and place are trying to exist and do something with their lives.

You might think that The Wire is all heady drama, when in fact, the magic of it, is that it's extremely subtle, and reveals itself brick by brick in a manner that will have you on the edge of your seat, or on the floor laughing hysterically.  At the end, what I marvel at, is that The Wire is at once all the things you'd expect in a masterpiece, and yet at the same time, profoundly entertaining.

2098141,5,B0002ERXC2,"The Wire, is the realist cop show on TV, bar none. The depth of the character's engrosses the viewer and straying from the traditional standard of TV storytelling gives this show the realness that most shows lack. The line between good and bad is very thin as the ""heroes"" tend to be flawed and the ""villians"" have many charismatic traits. Also, the show delves into the politics of any and all idealistic instituions (i.e. law enforcement, politics and working class America etc.) and exposing the human factor which displays the good and bad of all organizations, which makes for a very thought provoking viewing experience.

This is not an easy watch, where it all is clear within one episode, but as you watch repeatedly and more episodes, you are thoroughly engaged by the incredible writing, imagery and especially the powerful acting performances.

The Wire is best suited for DVD so one can really understand through watching over and over and can make for great discussion as groups interpret and analyze the show.",1093910400,9,1023,4.941860465116279

It took me two goes before I got into it - beware, this is not like anything you'll see anywhere else on TV. The first couple of episodes of the first season are slow... and complicated.

Then... you start to get it. And there is no getting away from it. A lot of people have compared it here with 6 Feet Under and the Sopranos; its a completely different thing. Much more of a real slice of life of the urban environment than the other two shows, and in my opinion considerably more intelligent.

I'll let the other reviewers give the praise - incredibly well developed characters, both bad guys and good. All the good guys have flaws, all the bad guys are likeable in their own way. No big name actors, but the acting is great with the occasional exception.

Why you need the DVD - this show has a LOT of characters to keep straight. The language isn't always easy to follow. This is the one show you WILL watch again and again. And you will pick up all sorts of subtleties the second, third and fourth times through the series.

Buy this DVD. Make sure you have some time. Stick with it even if you are struggling in the beginning. And then become hooked.

I usually don't like cop dramas, and I've never watched [NYPD Blue] or [Homicide: Life on the Street] (the latter of which was based on a book written by [Wire] creator David Simon). But from the first episode of [The Wire], I was hooked. It features such an amazing group of interesting, well-drawn-out characters, it's virtually impossible not to care about them. And it does well to present the main issue--the drug culture in Baltimore--from the point of view of both the investigating cops and the drug dealers (and in season two drug traffickers were added). [The Wire] has great acting and is extraordinarily well written. Just try watching one episode, and not be dying to know what happens next!

Now granted, this is not a show that is easily accessible to the casual viewer. There are so many characters and storylines that you basically need to watch every episode to keep up. So what better medium to watch the show than DVD!! It's about time HBO is releasing season one, and I very much look forward to season three later this year.

[The Wire] is not the most uplifting show you'll see this year, but it will likely be the best.",1090886400,30,1308,4.585470085470085

8027342,1,B0002ERXC2,"I could't get through the first episode. I was a cop for almost a decade and not even narcs and vice guys act that way. Goober narc cops acting like a bunch of teenagers. The acting was cheesy and the portrayal of Policing was terrible, at least in the first episode. I can only hope it gets better but I chose not to endure it to see. I honestly can't see why this got such good reviews. Check out Bosch here on Amazon. Much more realistic and WAY better acting.",1524960000,,463,4.155555555555556

8027350,5,B0002ERXC2,"The Wire (2002-2008) is excellent. It paved the way for an even better drug crime show, Breaking Bad (2008-2013).

Most people are aware of corporate espionage and what some companies will do to protect their secrets. In the TV show Breaking Bad the two main characters, Walter White, played by Bryan Cranston, and Jesse Pinkman, played by Aaron Paul, possess the knowledge and skill to produce the best meth on the market. And their brand is easily identifiable by its unique blue color.

Several competing criminal organizations buy their services and try to replicate their product but Whites and Pinkmans skill in the art and science of making their blue meth product isn't easily duplicated. One group tries to hold Pinkman hostage in Mexico because their highly trained scientists cant make meth as well as he does. Near the end of the series another criminal group keeps Pinkman chained in their lab and force him to make meth for them because their guy, who worked with both White and Pinkman, is unable to duplicate Pinkmans and Walter Whites skill in the art and science of making their blue meth brand.

Breaking Bad has one of the best story and character arcs ever used in a TV show, which is why it has an IMDb rating of 9.5, right up there with Game of Thrones, another great show. The Wire (2002-2008) was as good as the Sons of Anarchy (2008-2014), but not as good as Breaking Bad. I won't give away the ending of Breaking Bad, but if you watch the complete series, from the first episode to the last, the ending will make complete sense and be very satisfying. Its terrific.

If the above series don't sound interesting here are a few of the series I really enjoyed watching more than once: Band of Brothers (2001), Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Black Sails (2014-2017), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lonesome Dove (1989), Lost (2004-2010), Merlin (2008-2012), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek The Original Series (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish, or the hundreds of other fantasy and science fiction shows Ive watched.

If you like reading try some of my favorite authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1520380800,,2634,5.073903002309469
