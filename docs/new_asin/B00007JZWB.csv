7977310,1,B00007JZWB,"Except for the last title (Strange Love of Marth Ivers) these are mediocre films with Kirk Douglas.  And in Ivers, Douglas does not star in it but has a supportive role opposite Lizabeth Scott and Van Heflin.  I would give this collection a no star except I do like Van Heflin, but the other two films are not that good especially when there are so many excellent film starring Douglas.",1428883200,,386,4.5

Kirk Douglas is an iconic actor and if you are a fan like I am, then this collection should be in your library.",1416873600,,252,4.142857142857143
7977312,5,B00007JZWB,"The three movies in this set are:

1. Great Guy (1936)  This is the first of two films Cagney made at Grand National Pictures. It is one of Cagney's post-code tough guy films in which he is on the right side of the law for a change. Here he works at the Bureau of Weights and Measures and is trying to stop the corruption of grocers charging too much for their wares by claiming food weighs more than it does. Don't laugh, this is one of Cagney's better law and order type films. There is also the involvement of a larger criminal conspiracy, and Cagney is having problems with his love interest in the film, as usual.
2.. Something to Sing About (1937) This is more of a comedy than a musical. It was made by Cagney at Grand National Pictures during one of his frequent tiffs with Warner Brothers. The movie failed and bankrupted the company. There's plenty to like here, but this really isn't a musical. Cagney dances only at the beginning and the end.
3. Blood on the Sun (1945) After Cagney won his Academy Award for Best Actor, he broke free of Warner Bros. and began focusing on what he considered to be art. Cagney's own production company made this wartime thriller, and it is one of his better efforts among his 1940's independent works. Cagney plays an American newspaper reporter living in Japan who crosses wires with the expansionist Japanese government. Cagney's character is fluent in both Japanese and Chinese, and even knows judo. It's refreshing to see a film from the immediate post-war era that doesn't try to simplify the problem of what happened in Japan and Germany with something like - If only these people would start playing baseball, learn to love hot dogs, and be more like Americans, this sort of thing would never have happened.

I've had hit and miss quality from Madacy, but the video and audio quality on these three films are OK if you understand you are getting public domain quality copies.",1211587200,9,1927,4.59593023255814
7977313,3,B00007JZWB,"The KIRK DOUGLAS TRIPLE FEATURE showcases three of the actor's earliest films.

In MY DEAR SECRETARY, Douglas seems so young he's almost unrecognizable. This screwball comedy has Kirk portraying a playboy-author who hires a gal straight out of a writing class to take shorthand for his next novel. A mutual attraction leads to marriage, and later, a rivalry. Keenan Wynn, as the zany next-door/live-in neighbor, steals the show.

THE STRANGE LOVE OF MARTHA IVERS is the most famous movie in this small set. A classic film noir starring Barbara Stanwyck as a ruthless, domineering businesswoman with a deep, dark secret. Douglas, in one of his more complex roles, is her alcoholic D.A. husband.

THE BIG TREES is a tecnicolor feast about dishonest lumberman and all-around heel Douglas who cheats his workmen and alienates everyone closest to him. After relocating from Wisconsin to California, Kirk intends to rob land from a religious sect and cut down the ancient redwoods on it. Tragic events make him change his ways, and by story's end bad guy becomes hero.

(5.6) The Big Trees (1952) - Kirk Douglas/Eve Miller/Edgar Buchanan/Alan Hale Jr.
(5.8) My Dear Secretary (1949) - Laraine Day/Kirk Douglas/Keenan Wynn/Rudy Vallee
(7.5) The Strange Love of Martha Ivers (1946) - Barbara Stanwyck/Van Heflin/Lisabeth Scott/Kirk Douglas/Judith Anderson",1183852800,12,1347,5.309859154929577

7977315,4,B00007JZWB,"Here are three Fred Astaire movies:  Second Chorus, Royal Wedding, and The Over the Hill Gang Rides Again.  The first movie, Second Chorus is a light, frivolous movie, with less of Astaire's dancing than is typical in his outings with Ginger Rogers.  It's fun to see, but the print is fairly muddy, and sometimes it's hard to see detail.  Royal Wedding is cute, and features some of Astaire's classic dance scenes--the hatrack dance and the dance on the ceiling number.  The Over the Hill Gang Rides Again is a made-for-television movie featuring a number of familiar old faces from Westerns.  It's an ok movie, and it's fun to see Astaire in the ""fish out of water"" kind of a movie.  It's Fred Astaire's only Western, and although he plays a Texas Ranger, he's the most dandified Texas Ranger you'll ever see.  Overall, the DVD compilation is fun, and the price is certainly low enough to overcome the print quality objection.",1043280000,106,927,4.75
