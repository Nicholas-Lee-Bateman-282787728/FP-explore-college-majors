8066330,1,B0007TKOJ6,"Understand the video really is for new players who have no idea at all what they are doing. And its not a very good one.
it offers a few ideas on how to care for your instrument. I do not like how they tell you that if you had a set up and something is wrong the guy looks into the camera and says ""neck adjustment"". What a way to give new players advice. Adjusting the neck an easy way of breaking the truss rod when it doesn't adjust how they like it.
I would really take the advice in this video with a grain of salt its not very sound advice. Dan Erlewine has much better videos and shows you exactly what he is doing every step of the way, which this video does not.
On the experienced side I have to add this
This thing is horrible I wish I could give it a minus star rating. I was robbed of my time and money and this was given to me as a gift I might add.
The menu pops up and your ears are assaulted by a sub par guitar player trying to get through what is obviously his first public performance...did they actually pay the person who ""performed"" this.
so knowing they actually included this as the menu music I had little hope for the video. As I trudged on with the simpleton advice I was delighted to know I had a new coaster for my coffee table.",1366675200,,1258,3.996031746031746
8066331,1,B0007TKOJ6,"This video doesn't really give much instruction. I got annoyed listening to the ""luthier"" guy who wasn't exactly well spoken. Save your $, bail on this one!",1246924800,,156,4.814814814814815
8066332,1,B0007TKOJ6,"This DVD contains information on the basic setup of a guitar, covering string changes, intonation setup, action setup, etc, plus some more advanced information like replacing pots and pickups.

The problem is that it never goes deep enough to be of any benefit. While it may fill in some of the blanks for someone with a little knowledge, the hosts glaze over so many details that the viewer will come away still unable to perform the task. The really basic procedures are covered enough that a beginner should get something from them, but if you're looking to say, resize the slots in a nut for a larger string gauge, you will find that although they speak of filing the slots bigger, they show absolutely nothing on how to actually go about it. Unfortunately, this scenario repeats several times throughout the DVD.

While this DVD can be interesting at times and the cost is quite low, there are far more informative guitar maintenance DVD's out there, as well as many good books. I cannot recommend this product.",1246665600,,1016,4.767045454545454
8066333,1,B0007TKOJ6,"This video was somewhat informative but they never did show you the actual maintenance or repairs being done. They talk about alot of maintenance and setup information but never come through with a visual of what they are explaining. If all your looking for is general guitar care and repair information and not ""How To"" instructions, then this is the DVD for you. I hate to say but I will be tossing this video. I did get a good one that John Carruthers (Carruthers Gutars) is on and he shows you what he is talking about and how to do most everything he is addressing on the video. See the reviews on ""Alfred's Teach Yourself Guitar Repair and Maintenance"".",1201305600,6,659,4.546218487394958
8066334,2,B0007TKOJ6,"This poorly produced ""home video"" may be helpful for those who really only need the introductory information.  However, when advanced topics arise, the two hosts simply tell the viewer to ""consult with your local luthier...""  I purchased this video to avoid paying my local luthier!  Lastly, many of the camera angles are so poor that you literally cannot see some of the repairs.  Oh well, at least it was under ten bucks!",1175731200,3,423,4.833333333333333
8066335,5,B0007TKOJ6,"This video gets it done. A no-nonsense run through of electric guitar construction, basic care, upgrades and repair. Good info about when to repair and when to take it to a professional. Excellent soldering instruction. Less material for acoustics, but most acoustic repairs are best left to the pros. If you're an electric guitar tinkerer, this is indespensible information. Why aren't there more videos like this? Fabulous price too; video quality is about on a par with your local PBS channel programming, very acceptable.",1145923200,7,525,5.261904761904762
