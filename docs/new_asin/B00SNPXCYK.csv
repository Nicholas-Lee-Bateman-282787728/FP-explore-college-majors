6991646,5,B00SNPXCYK,"What can be said!  Joe keeps it rolling!  As a Bonamassa fan for years now and seeing him live in Huntington, W.VA, Richmond, VA and experiencing a Meet & Greet in Pittsburgh, I would have to rate ""Red Rocks"" as his best release since ""Royal Albert Hall"".  The accompanying Brass, Harmonica, Keyboards and Percussion are top notch. Joe's fluid interaction with the band makes it all become one.  Joe does not play the music, he ""IS"" the music!  If you are a Bonamassa fan, you know exactly what I mean by that statement. Purchase the DVD, invite a few friends over, kick back and enjoy!",1427673600,4,586,4.542857142857143
6991647,5,B00SNPXCYK,"move over Eric Clapton, there is a new guitar king, this guy is awesome.  Eric had many years when he Joe's age and now it's his time.  He is rocking the world, tickets are 6 months in advance and very high, that's why I have a home theatre system, no air plain tickets, motel rooms, and many other expensive things to see him in person.  You do need a blue ray system with a large screen to see and hear him like sitting on stage, a good system is worth it !!!",1427587200,,461,3.989130434782609

6991649,5,B00SNPXCYK,YOWZA!!!!  I'd give it 10 stars if I could!!!  This is a fantastic concert and all the musicians look like they are having a fabulous time doing it!!!  Well done!,1427500800,,162,4.333333333333333
6991650,5,B00SNPXCYK,"This is the best I have seen Joe yet. His stage presence is usually very intense, but on this recording I got the sense he was actually having fun with the band, the music, and the environment. The camera work and editing is the best of all his DVDs to date; many closeups of Joe's hand work and enough time devoted to other band members also. The Delta backstory with Kevin was full of dry humor and musical curiosity. Red Rocks is an amazing venue, and I'm glad J&R produced a live show from there. Congrats to Joe and his band and crew!",1427328000,12,539,4.242718446601942
6991651,5,B00SNPXCYK,Great concert!  Wish I'd been there!,1427241600,2,36,5.0
6991652,5,B00SNPXCYK,"The two DVD disc set of his 2014 Red Rocks concert permanently preserves an amazing performance in a spectacular venue witnessed by a sell-out crowd of 9,000 strong - his largest to date. The package is over two hours in length, includes over twenty tracks, four bonus features and a photo-filled booklet. He performs a good mix of his older songs, like Sloe Gin and Ballad of John Henry, some of his new, like Oh, Beautiful! and Love Ain't a Love Song, along with some classics like Double Trouble and I Can't Be Satisfied.

With this release the question is whether or not another live performance from Joe Bonamassa has anything new to offer? For me the answer is unequivocal partially because in concert he simply does not disappoint, but I also find it fascinating to watch his evolution - re-thinking and re-interpreting songs I have heard him play before. He successfully manages to keep a new edge to the music while not wandering too far away from home base.

Red Rocks breathtaking setting coupled with Bonamassa's mind boggling playing creates visuals that border on sensory overload. The picture clarity is spectacular, and the sound reproduction is excellent. The filming captures the beauty of the venue, the energy of the crowd and of course the magic of the performance without indulging in artistic over-kill. The viewer never forgets they are at a concert - the balance is near-perfect.

Bonamassa is in superb form operating, if not at his zenith, darn close to it. Attired in a skinny black tux the rest of the band wears black ties and white dinner jackets with the three-piece horn section standing behind old-style bandstands. Whether there is a thread to connect the apparel with the music I don't know but it did work as visual reinforcement of the tight unit created by the players. Together they looked as cohesive as they sounded.

Highlights include Tiger in Your Tank which begins with old black and white Muddy Waters performance footage projected on the big screen by the stage. After a few beats into the song, Bonamassa and the band seamlessly slip into place taking over. The same technique is used with How Many More Years with Howlin' Wolf performing the song that gracefully morphs into a live Bonamassa and band performance. This is an effective technique which pays homage to the music's origins and two of the bluesmen that paved the way.

More high points in the concert include You Shook Me (and Double Trouble) which brought the crowd to its feet, and Shake For Me, which featured stellar breaks by Reese Wynans on keyboards and Kirk Fletcher on guitar. You know the band is great when each member's solos are not something to endure until the ""star"" starts playing again, but are wholly engrossing in their own right.

Bonamassa's Albert Hall Concert DVD stays with me because of his obvious joy at realizing a dream of performing on that stage, and that same feeling exists here. I do not own every one of his concert DVDs, I judge them individually before buying. And, although I readily admit I could sit completely mesmerized and watch the guy play for hours, in spite of this bias, this is a great concert captured in a skillfully executed DVD set - easily worth every cent.",1427241600,21,3224,4.779174147217235
6991653,5,B00SNPXCYK,"Joe Bonamassa at his very best! The best blues show I've seen Joe put on and it's well worth it. I agree fully with the other review as well. I thought Albert hall was Joe's best but, I have to say this is Joe's very best blues. WOW! He came fully prepared to play blues and he gave it his absolute best! Joe Bonamassa , Kevin Shirley, and the Band just blows the doors off this show. This has to be the greatest DVD Tribute to Muddy Waters and Howlin Wolf of it's kind. I think Joe, Kevin, and the band should get an award for this show. The best part of it though is that it's for "" Keeping the Blues Alive"". Highly recommended! Buy it and sit back and enjoy the concert!",1427155200,6,673,4.029850746268656
6991654,5,B00SNPXCYK,"Wow, what a performance by Joe and his band. I was thoroughly entertained. I own most of Joe's DVD's and thought his Royal Albert Hall was his best but I must say, I think Joe, Kevin and Roy out did themselves with this one, it's now my favorite. I can see Joe being considered for a Grammy for this outstanding tribute to Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf at Red Rocks!",1427155200,25,366,4.242857142857143

I was a teen in the 60's and have experienced some of the best guitar players ever. Bonamassa is in a class by himself. He is, without question, the best. I have been an amateur picker for most of my life and can tell you that what this guy does is unnatural.

6991693,5,B00SNPXCYK,"Joe B. and his crew led by Philippe Klose (director) and Kevin Shirley (producer) create some of the best concert videos out there.  I will admit Im also a fan of Bonamassas hard driving blues-rock, but beyond that the Blu ray packages are always first rate in terms of video and audio quality.  This disc comes with a 1080p video resolution and a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  The picture is terrific and the camera direction eschews the fast editing jumps so common today.  The colors are beautiful, showing off the magnificent outdoor theater located just west of Denver.  Bonamassa notes that hes playing in front of the largest audience hes ever had (about 9,000) at the sold out show.

The audio is truly spectacular with a terrific DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track.  The subs jump when asked and the overall surround experience is terrific.  For purists, the 2 channel option is also available.  The early part of the disc has some brief documentary style context where Joe gets into his roots where the southern black, blues musicians were influential in his music.  Most prominent were Muddy Waters and Howlin Wolf.  One of the nifty editing tricks has the musician on old black and white film playing a song which segues into Bonamassa picking up the song on queue.  As you would expect, the song explodes from a one man, one guitar singer to a large amplified sound.  In this case Bonamassas band includes a 3-man horn section, a drummer (Anton Fig from the Letterman show), keys, guitar, harmonica and bass supplementing Bonamassas masterful lead guitar.

The songs are all from Waters stylings in the first section and Howlin Wolf later.  Many are from the great musician and song writer Willie Dixon.  Bonamassa gets into his own material during the 20 minute encore including Sloe Gin and The Ballad of John Henry.  Stellar stuff.",1451174400,,1834,4.826923076923077

The content, Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf tunes, are some of the best blues ever written and Joe and the band  do justice to them with an outstanding performance.

Joe, as usual, has assembled an outstanding band.  Anton Fig really shines behind the drum kit.  The band is tight and the selection of songs from Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf are great.  I was impressed with 2nd guitarist Kirk Fletcher.  This guy can really play the blues.  Bottom line, if you are a fan of the blues and/or Joe, pick this up asap.

Mr. Bonamassa sings with a fake, old-south, Tobacco Road accent, similar to Mick Jagger.  I find it very distracting.  There are other guitarists out there with more charisma and stage presence.  Bonamassa's role model is more along the lines of Chicago blues - such as B.B. King, visually.  I hear influences from Hendrix and Jimmy Page when he plays.",1441152000,,528,4.747252747252747

Joe and his crackerjack band turn out sophisticated but SMOKIN' renditions of classic Muddy and Wolf tunes, and thankfully Joe does not restrain himself too much in his fiery guitar solos...this is blues with an unapologetic rock edge while retaining that authentic blues sound!

Great crowd response (not merely bragging...haha)...a lot of Joe's blistering solos are answered with a loud roar...that kind of interaction just makes for a much more enjoyable concert experience, especially when watching the DVD!

Of course, Joe was sharp enough to realize that fans were eager to watch him perform some of his own material, so at the end of the night he gracioiusly obliged with searing performances of a few Joe tunes...covering all the bases...en route to completing a grand slam home run! :-)

A MUST HAVE for all Joe B. fans and Muddy/Wolf fans alike!",1432598400,3,1212,4.960591133004926

Old tunes / New tunes. Fresh and full of life.

I'm not a huge JB fan as I think he's more flash and marketing than some of the other great blues guitarists out there today (and this show reveals that as, in my opinion, Joe's playing is much better on his original rock blues stuff than it is on the traditional blues of Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf) but this video is excellent - great shots of the most beautiful concert venue in the world, and the mix is really well done too.

His playing, singing, stage demeanor are top shelf; the audio, editing, and overall production of this Red Rocks show should be the standard by which other performers record their shows. I've been to Red Rocks and the camera work here is just superb. Kudos to those responsible for editing. Joe's Royal Albert Hall show was my favorite, but this one trumps it.

I actually went to Denver for this concert last year (sat in the front row), and I was literally blown away with the performance by a 'put-together' band of world class band members backing Joe Bonamassa! The venue; the production; the sold-out crowd; the weather; the music was out of this world! Best concert experience EVER!! Gave me goose-bumps watching this and reliving every moment of that memorable evening!! I'm going back out to Denver to see him again, this August 17, 2015.

Everybody enjoyed the show, I do immensely, and the documentaries are very informative, but for the ones using analog Hi-End audio outs, in the Hi-End BD players, be aware all documentaries are somewhat in some parts out of sync, why not paying attention to those details, for a $20.00 plus BD, it should be perfect, guys we are on the 21st century...First the Nirvana BD, after, the Crossroads festival, the last one in the MSG, and now these documentaries out of sync...Despite the flamboyant and very nice 57 Bel Air, which I absolutely loved...guys out of sync...come on...!!!!

6991815,3,B00SNPXCYK,"I found this concert to be a bit boring. I think Joe has great tone, but other than that, he really isn't a great blues player. He is, however, a really good rock player, and this is where he shines. You can see this on songs such as John Henry. Of course, people will disagree with me because they think rock/blues is blues, but I just don't think Joe really has the blues in his blood. Anton Fig doesn't either. Joe is, and everything about him says, rock. He wants to claim to be a blues player, but, honestly, he just doesn't know the genre. Just because he can play a blues song doesn't make him a blues musician. Joe is constantly shredding or playing anthem like leads. Not that his solos are bad, they aren't, they are mostly solid, and pretty good, but they aren't blues. He screams at you when he plays solos. That is not what blues is about. His sensibility is all wrong. He really should stick to rock where he really excels. Highly recommended for people who confuse rock with blues, but a miss for real blues lovers.",1428537600,2,1030,4.341968911917099

Anyone who likes Joe's brand of guitar pyrotechnics will not be disappointed with this show. There is plenty of Smokin Joe to go around. The audio and video are simply dazzling.

Joe Bonamassa is a master at marketing himself in a genre that is slowly dieing.  All forms or rock and roll and even modern blues came from the legends that started out in the Missisppi Delta area like clarksdale and migrated to Chicago.  Bands like Zeppelin, the Who, Cream and the Stones are so heavily influenced by this type of blues.
Bonamassa chose the Red Rocks Pavillion and the Venue becomes an integral part of the performance.  The venue is beautiful and lends itself to a great evening.
Performance wise, Joe has never sounded better, the band was spot on, and they even recreated the stage to resemble the Newport Jazz Fest.  Band members wore dinner jackets and ties, Joe wore a tux.  The concert recording is impeccable and is shot so you feel like you are there as part of the audience!  The setlist starts with a tribute to muddy waters then a Howlin wolf tribute followed up by joes own great songs.  Over two hours of music. Highly recommended!
