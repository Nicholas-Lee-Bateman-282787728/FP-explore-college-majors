8252871,4,B0013TPNQS,"For the most part I loved this video. Watching the inking is inspiring and Joe's dialogue is interesting, both when he is discussing technique and art concepts. My only problem is that the video is running at what looks like 3X speed. This allows them to get you more inking per minute in the video but for technical trades I prefer to see real-time video so we can learn where it counts the most- in the subtle nuances. It's kinda like studying a golf swing but having to watch it sped up.",1342483200,2,490,4.336956521739131
8252872,5,B0013TPNQS,"May not show you how to ink as a step by step guide would, but this video has helped me become a better artist in so many ways. It is incredible to see inside this brilliant artist works. Easily the most valuable buy for any artist of any medium. Simply watching him throw perfect lines will teach you how to do better yourself, you can see how textures are created, form is hinted at and how the inker adds so much more depth to beautiful linework. Best buy ever.",1306800000,,464,4.224719101123595
8252873,3,B0013TPNQS,"If you want to learn comic book inking you may just want to avoid this.  There is no actual explanation of how to ink.  He essentially shows his warm ups then you get to watch him ink.

He is a good inker technically but not a good teacher.  If your a beginner or in the middle I do recommend getting this to help get the juices flowing when the blocks come.",1279152000,3,358,4.0
8252874,1,B0013TPNQS,A poor guide by a mediocre inker. Very little useful information or instruction on the 'old school' method of comic book inking. Don't waste your money. If you want to learn old school methods there are much better materials out there.,1267315200,2,235,4.7560975609756095
8252875,5,B0013TPNQS,A must have for any aspiring comic book inker. Joe Weems is an incredible inker and he definitely knows what he's doing. More importantly he knows how to transmit his knowledge and experience to the viewer. I recommend this DVD to anybody who's interested in seeing what this mostly overlooked artform brings to comics.,1233014400,2,319,4.925925925925926
