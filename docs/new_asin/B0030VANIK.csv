4046863,1,B0030VANIK,"You have to love Amazon.com. We get a new release of The Commish by an entirely different company while Amazon decides to move the reviews of the Anchor Bay release, a release some reviewers have noted has cut versions of several episodes, here to the file for the new release. It would be nice if the idiot savants at Amazon.com didn't do this. Why?  Because the new release might, since it is licensed from Cannell, have the uncut versions of the episodes and it would be nice to know if this is the case. It is nice to know that Amazon.com doesn't care about this. So Amazon I am giving you a big O stars for your fourth rate practises here. Bravo and Brava. And as your reward I may never purchase anything else from you.",1266883200,5,725,4.330882352941177
4046864,3,B0030VANIK,"Well, first of all it would have been nice to see season 3 released instead of a rehash of already commercially available season 1 & 2 but I digress.

The GOOD news:
1. This set is far cheaper if price was your reason for skipping the first go round release of season 1 and 2 a few years ago.

2. Target is selling season 1 & 2 for $14.99 in a limited edition 2 for pack available now. Just got mine today. So my advice would be to skip Amazon's offering  on this item (I canceled my pre-order)and save money in the long run by getting the 2 for deal.

Now for the BAD news:

This is the no frills edition. (What can you really expect for $11?)

1. The 4 discs contained come in paper sleeves! I've seen some cost cutting schemes in my time when manufacturers skimp on dvd releases but this takes the cake. I've seen bootleg dvds that are packaged more professionally than this.

2. The episodes are the butchered ones from the prior releases. You would have thought that if they were going to redo these 2 seasons over, they would have  atleast issued them uncut this time.

So only buy this if:

A. You didn't buy the original release a few years ago because of cost

B. You want your set to match seasons 3 & 4 if they ever come out

C. Your old sets are all scratched and beat up in the 4/5 years you've been waiting for season 3 to be released.",1264032000,13,1349,4.126436781609195
4046905,5,B0030VANIK,This was a gift for my mother. She was so excited to get this because she loved the show when it was on tv,1407801600,,106,3.4583333333333335
4046906,5,B0030VANIK,One of my favorite series even if it only lasted 2 seasons. Michael Chiklis  is outstanding. Highly recommend! blah blah,1401235200,,120,5.0
4046907,5,B0030VANIK,I watched this show when it was on the air and loved it! I was happy to finally get it on DVD. It's not a perfect DVD but I can watch the show and that is all that i wanted. I don't need fancy extras or blu ray to make me happy with this!,1386374400,,238,3.425925925925926
4046908,5,B0030VANIK,"I like this show.
It isn't perfect, but fairly family friendly.
The DVD picture and sound seem good, no problems so far.",1326412800,,120,4.5

4046911,3,B0030VANIK,"As commented to a previous post no this isn't ""The Shield"".  In fact it could be seen as the polar opposite of The Shield.  It was a good show for it's time, and provided good clean family entertainment which is all it ever claimed to do.  It wasn't supposed to be ""edgy"" or anything like that.  Glad to see it out on DVD and a reasonable price...but PAPER SLEEVES? Come on!",1295654400,,374,4.225352112676056
4046912,5,B0030VANIK,I always enjoyed this show and decided to get a season on DVD since it is no longer on TV.Seems like they take all the good shows off now! Glad I can get them on DVD.Thanks,1286755200,,172,3.8055555555555554
4046913,3,B0030VANIK,"I had never watched this series when it was on TV but enjoyed all the first season episodes. I noted that the character of ""The Commish"" was based on a real-life Rye, New York Police Commissioner. Boy, I'd like to meet that guy. Enjoy!",1275696000,,235,4.363636363636363
4046914,3,B0030VANIK,"The other reviews say that this isn't like The Shield and they're right. This show is OLD. Filmed in 91, it looks like eighties. Michael Chiklis is great as Scalli. A little strange with the east coast accent. If not for him it would have been unwatchable for me. Kinda cheesy compared to today's dramas, without much violence, language, or T and A. Older folks wanting to reminisce won't be dissapointed. For younger people who want lots of action and realism, this probably isn't your cup of tea.",1267488000,,498,4.670454545454546

8386146,4,B0030VANIK,"I was buying DVDs on amazon and if you spent $149, shipping would be free. My order originally came to $146, so I was looking for a cheap DVD to get the free shipping. I saw they were selling Commish season 1 for $3.99 and I figured if I only enjoyed 1 episode, I would get my money's worth. Guess what? I enjoyed every episode and made me go out and season 2. BTW, season 2 is every bit as good season 1. Michael Chiklis is the franchise player of the series. Everything starts and stops with him, he is Da Man.",1428192000,,512,4.029411764705882
