8485158,5,B005SIMJ6W,"The concert is great , Over 30 songs and covers his entire career. WOW I wish I was there. Band is excellent and audio very good.",1387152000,2,129,4.0
8485159,5,B005SIMJ6W,"This is a great DVD,  Paul just keeps on singing and singing.  Everything is so clear and it was another great DVD to add to my collection",1384387200,3,138,4.074074074074074
8485160,5,B005SIMJ6W,"I, too, took a chance because of the low price - and I'm glad I did!  It's nice to have a full concert without the edits, interviews and other commentary that Macca insists on including in his commercial releases.  Paul, the fans want to see you play, not talk to Putin - full, uncut concerts would be so much nicer!  Video/audio are both excellent, and it's a fun show - fans can't go wrong with this one.",1384387200,3,406,4.246753246753247
8485161,5,B005SIMJ6W,"Bought this on e-bay based on customer comments. Happy to have this in my collection. Paul has a fan brought up on stage because she had a sign reading sign my arm so I can have it tattooed. He brought out a full bag pipe band while playing Mull of Kintire. Great sound, a professional video, probably done by a TV station in Nova Scotia.",1369612800,6,338,4.2153846153846155
8485162,5,B005SIMJ6W,"I've seen this DVD offered on Amazon and EBay for some time .It's a video of Paul and his current band in Halifa Nova Scotia playing an outdoor concert. Because there have been no reviews, and not looking like an official release, thinking it would be an boot leg film from the crowd, I've held off buyng it. Recently I decided beause the price was good, to take a chance on it. I'm glad I did. The camera work is excellent and the audio very good. The camera pans from Paul, to the band, to the crowd in a nice even order. There are good close ups of eveyone without those jumpy shots that sometimes make you sick. There are 34 songs played in entirety, reminding me of the last concert I saw Paul play almost two years ago. It's not Blue Ray, but I ejoyed the quality of both picture and sound, and am very glad to now have this in my McCartney collection. If you're a McCartney fan, I recommend adding this DVD to your collection too. I wish I had done so a few years ago. Now that you finally have a review, go buy it! Makes me wish I could go to a McCartney concert right now.",1358812800,11,1081,4.127962085308057
