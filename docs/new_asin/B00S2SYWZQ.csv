6951207,5,B00S2SYWZQ,"I watched this on PBS and found it so lovely, I had to order a copy of my own! It's the story of the little British Post Office at Port Lockroy, Antarctica, occupied during the summer months by thousands of charismatic gentoo penguins who set up shop right outside the Post Office to raise their young, and visited by throngs of intrepid tourists who come to see the penguins and post a penguin card to loved ones from the end of the earth.  Besides being charming and eccentric in the best sense, it's a terrific documentary on the incredible, complex, alternately amusing and astonishing behavior of the gentoos.  In short, a documentary I won't soon forget!",1423872000,2,660,4.681034482758621
6951208,5,B00S2SYWZQ,"Don't let these comic penguins to fool you for a minute. They dive six hundred feet to the bottom of the ocean and on land, they can outrun humans. At some twenty MPH, they are the fastest birds in water. They are fun and full of energy as well as humor. They cheat on their partners and take one hell lot of beating for their act but not as much as the female cheat who really gets a beating unlike I have seen before in penguins. They continuously steal rocks from each other and adults can be brutal to the point that they kill chicks which is painful to watch. Leave it to the English to colonize and put up a post office in a beautiful peninsula which is an extension of South America Andes, forming a coastal spine of mountains whose jagged peaks rise straight out of the ocean. The unbelievable scenery will cast a spell on all those who have the good fortune to visit in person or view this video. Amazing beauty. Bravo, bravo, bravo.",1422489600,3,942,4.297752808988764

I want to see all of these cute, little Gentoo penguins as well as the breath-taking sights and the history of the post office. My only issue with this documentary is that it was too short.",1509667200,,329,4.409836065573771

8697179,3,B00S2SYWZQ,"""Happy Feet"" and ""March of the Penguins"" may have given viewers the impression that penguins' lives are all fun and cuteness.  This program is not a downer, but it shows a darker side.  The program shows some adult penguins killing a penguin youth and then the penguin's twin's response to it.  After ""March"" was released, talking heads said, ""Why can't we humans be monogamous like penguins?""  This doc showed a female penguin attacking a penguin mistress and her penguin husband.  The program says there is excrement all over penguin territory and that the smell is horrendous to newcomers.  They show some penguins excreting and I had to close my eyes for a second.  The fact that the show has a ""post office"" in it is meant to celebrate that penguins and humans can co-exist.  Still, I was wondering, ""Why would one send a postcard from Antarctica?""  I didn't get the sense that postcards from there would arrive back speedily to the human world.  Plus, was this post office highlighted just for viewers who don't care about matters that don't concern our own species?  At no point, do you ever see penguins walking over to humans wanting to be petted like dogs or cats might.  Penguins just don't see these particular humans as a threat.  At one point we see a bird regurgitate a fish for its family's meal.  I like being presented with the fact, but I also thought, ""Thank goodness I hadn't just ate.""  This program showed penguins stealing other penguins' rocks but didn't show any child kidnappings as other docs have.  This work is great if you want lots of realism and the good and bad side of issues.  However, if you want all glee and happiness and ""Happy Feet,"" then you might be upset here.",1425081600,2,1704,4.6644295302013425
