film for all Americans.  If you want to ensure democracy you should buy and share with your family.",1226880000,20,169,4.25
3614225,5,B001GLLNNA,This great documentary work makes it clear that our government in partnership with the main street media is controlling what we know and what so called truth they manufacture for public consumption.  The death of free speech and free press will continue to reduce our individual freedom and is turning into government sponsored propoganda flooding the airways everyday.  Covering up actual truth and controlling information will slowly control our society and lead to socialisum.,1226880000,55,479,5.45945945945946
3614226,5,B001GLLNNA,"This movie should have been required watching for all Americans prior to the recent election.  Covers pretty much all the stuff that went on behind the scenes that prevented ""The Path to 9/11"" being seen by most.  And now one of these power-hungry types focused on in this movie may be secretary of state...scary.",1226880000,21,313,4.777777777777778
3614227,5,B001GLLNNA,"This is not really a review, although I'm sure this movie is a fair description of what went on when the Clintons barred the miniseries ""The Path to 9/11"" from ever being released on DVD - therefore 5 stars rather than 1, since this movie's release is very important. Luckily, I have my own recording of the TV-series from when it was broadcast on TV, so I actually did get to see what some powerful politicians didn't want me to...

Now, it seems as though Amazon wants to keep me from watching this particular movie aswell. This is merely a comment to the somewhat bizarre practices I've grown accustomed to when ordering political material from Amazon.com. This movie was released the same day that I ordered it, but for some reason Amazon is unable to ship it immediately. I don't believe this has anything to do with an exaggerated demand for this movie, since I'm sure its existence and release has been hushed to silence and forgottenness as effectively as the original TV-series was. This has happened to me before, with other political movies, of which one (if my memory serves me right) I think was ""Michael Moore hates America"".

I also notice that Newt Gingrich's DVD movie on American oil dependence ""We Have the Power"" has been released on Oct 8th, but won't be out on Amazon until Nov 4th! And for those who don't remember, that is Election Day...

Why does Amazon seem to take such a keen interest in consistently delaying a particular side of the story, thus keeping it from being fed to the public in due time?",1224028800,48,1528,4.610294117647059
3614228,3,B001GLLNNA,"Found this to be ok but nothing like ""The Path to 9/11"", that had the full story and looks at both sides, this was pointing away from the comspiracy theory which I found had more truth in it.  I wonder why that dvd has not come out as yet?. Barbara, Australia.",1365120000,,260,4.098039215686274
3614229,5,B001GLLNNA,"This should be required watching for all college students as well as anyone else interested in why this DVD has never been released. It's amazing how many things from ""The Path to 9/11"" have been proven and admitted to, even by Bill Clinton himself, since the mini-series aired in 2005. How I hope Disney will release it one day.",1313280000,,329,4.593220338983051
3614230,5,B001GLLNNA,Excellent video showing the mistakes that have been made by our government in dealing with terrorists and particularly in regard to Bill Clinton who did not do his job because he was too busy with Monika Lewinsky.  It also shows his lack of regard for the people of this country.,1302048000,2,279,4.58
3614231,5,B001GLLNNA,"What do YOU think about 9/11?

Do you think it was a plot laid by Bush or the Israeli Secret Service (MOSSAD)?  Would you like to have more information on the subject?

Would you like a six-hour TV docudrama that meticulously traces the path to 9/11?

Well, you can't have it.  (Or at least you were not allowed to have it until very recently.)

This DVD (""Blocking the Path to 9/11"") is an excellent explanation of exactly what happened to a $40 million docu-drama which happened to rub some Washington fat-cats the wrong way, and how they trampled all over the First Amendment to prevent you from seeing it.

This is, as far as I can tell, the first major indictment of the corrupt media and the corrupt politicians acting hand-in-glove together.

It's excellent, and very much worth your time.",1298592000,7,796,4.635714285714286
3614232,5,B001GLLNNA,"9/11 Commission chairman Tom Kean's comments really help make this documentary as devastating as it is. So do the interviews with the writer/producer and director of the Disney-ABC docudrama. The blocking issue is a testament to how thin-skinned the Clintons really are and how deep their connections to Hollywood where they have long gone to the well for campaign and other financial contributions. However the claim that the docudrama is not available on DVD is only true in the sense that it's not readily available at the usual places, such as here at Amazon. It is apparently being distributed through Canada, and can be had at The Film Finders, at filmfinders dot mybisi dot com.",1259193600,12,685,4.965217391304348
3614233,3,B001GLLNNA,"I didn't watch the TV mini-series because it was based on the compilation of distortion and lies called the ""9/11 Commission Report"".
The films ""World Trade"",""Flight 93"" and ""United 93"" all left me with a sinking feeling in my stomach like I'd just been had.
However, ""Blocking the Path"" documents the Clinton camp brewhaha and makes for a worthwhile view.
The movie is 94 minutes and could have been told in fifteen but the makers take their time to redundantly hammer home the point,
which is "" don't mess with an egomaniac like Bill Clinton "".
After watching ""Blocking"" I'm more interested in seeing ""the Path"" (unedited)
As for the politics, the one liberal in the film sees the light at the end of the story, but he still doesn't get it.
I once bought into the phony left/right paradigm too, but I realized that the Ruling Elite are more like actors than anything else.
The Republicans represent Fascist America and the Dems are the controlled opposition. At the end of the day it's 50/50 for them and  nothing but scraps for ""we the people"".
9/11 was an inside job, blamed on a gang that couldn't shoot straight, ISI/CIA asset dupes, leftovers from the Afgani/Russian war.
Clinton didn't kill Usama bin Laden because he ,like the Bushes, is close to the House of Saud  and the Bin Ladens.
""Blocking the Path"" is all about free speech and how the rich and powerful can stifle it.",1249603200,9,1384,4.644897959183673
3614234,4,B001GLLNNA,"This exposition of how much control the 'mainstream media' have over what you are allowed to ""know"" about current events should scare everyone, no matter who you might think was ""responsable"" for 9/11.  Take a look at this video, it might just surprise you.",1244592000,8,257,4.840909090909091
3614235,5,B001GLLNNA,This great documentary gives the whole truth and fills in the blanks that The Path to 9/11 leaves. This is fast paced and very informative. Highly recommended.,1239667200,7,159,4.925925925925926
3614236,5,B001GLLNNA,"It's refreshing to hear the truth about how politicians and big corporations can control the media, but it is also sad that it can happen here in the US where we value freedom of the press.  Ziegler shows just how President Clinton and Disney prevented the release of the docudrama ""The Path to 9/11"" and how the liberal media failed to ask the tough questions.  Definitely a must watch.",1238198400,8,387,4.594202898550725
3614237,5,B001GLLNNA,"I think this doc was very well done and agree that Path to 9/11 should be released on video. I watched this doc last night and believe it attacks censorship more than any political party.

Regardless of your political opinion, you should not be against the DVD release of the Path to 9/11. What country to do we live in here?

The one guy who is trashing this film in these reviews (Josh from Cleveland) is remarkably angry. His comments reinforce the tag ""liberal whiner"". Josh: If you are that politically tense inside, why don't you take an approach that might garner support for your views? Be professional and classy, instead of a crybaby kindergartner.

It was fascinating to hear exactly how parts were blocked, and who was behind it.  I'd have liked to see a little more of the uncut scenes, or where/how to purchase the original.

Any True American Patriots who are tired of being censored by ABC, and their parent company Disney, Here is your chance to obtain a brand new, factory sealed, English speaking, high quality, copy of the two disk DVD, ""The path to 9/11"".

If you cut and paste the above web site to your browser; please note, VERY IMPORTANT!!!, it is NOT!!!, filmfinders!!!! although at a quick glance that is what it appears to be, there is no ""L"" in this address. Instead it is very deliberately misspelled with TWO ii""s? Thats why I suggest you cut and paste.

This company is legitimate, and says they have a large supply of the 2 disk movie available, I have just received and am watching my copy right now. I paid with ""paypal"", and the price was only $17.00 / or $22.00 after shipping and handling. even during the holiday season it only took four days by standard shipping to arrive!!!

I was un-successful even with a bid of $150.00 to find a copy through Amazon.com, I tried for over two years to get a copy; now I have one!!!

3614250,5,B001GLLNNA,"This documentary is eye-opening in its directness and clarity.  It sheds light on the internal workings of the political and media elite who do their best to manage what we see and hear on a daily basis, often at the expense of the American people.  If you are conservative, and think you're familiar with media bias, even after this last election cycle, you can still learn something from viewing this DVD: how Bill Clinton or his associates ""reached out"" to Disney, ABC, and American Airlines to try to squash ""The Path to 9/11"", how even media-savvy Hollywood directors, editors, and producers can be (surprisingly) broadsided by the extent to which the left-wing will go to suppress the voices of those they feel threaten their agenda, and how the mainstream media has become complicit in this activity, or too lazy to care.  Now, I want to see ""The Path to 9/11"", because I did not see it when it originally aired.  Amazing that it's still not available for purchase.  I bought this DVD after reading a ""one star"" review of the documentary.  I just had to see what would influence someone to give a one star review when all the other reviews were much more positive.  Now, I know.",1230336000,10,1185,4.668269230769231
3614251,5,B001GLLNNA,It is completely unfathomable to me that this can happen in the United States.  Very informative.  The failure of the media to report without bias is disturbing to say the least.,1229299200,5,178,4.709677419354839
3614252,5,B001GLLNNA,"GREAT work, Mr. Z  (and everyone else involved)!!!

'Blocking the Path to 9/11' is well-made, informative, and a real eye opener as to the massive power
of the Clinton Machine (watch out, Obama - that's your new Secretary of State and her partner-in-crime).

In the new world order of NBC-esque propaganda manipulation, voices of truth like John Ziegler need to be
listened to, analyzed and supported by the real people who love this country.

Thanks to Mr. Ziegler (and others like him), there may be some hope for the reinstatement of  impartial journalism in this country. 'Blocking the Path to 9/11' is one of those first steps back to that concept.",1228694400,8,653,4.846846846846847
3614253,5,B001GLLNNA,"This video is a public service -- sobering, enlightening, not heavy-handed. Just the facts.  Inconvenient to the Clintons and democrats, but still the facts.
If the video was shown in high school history classes, as a break from the usual anti-U.S. bilge, maybe the zombies pouring out of public school wouldn't be so monolithic and robotic with their attitudes and votes. In short, they'd be slightly more educated.  And the U.S. would be a little bit safer, or at least the public might be more prepared to lay blame where it belongs after the next attack.",1228176000,16,558,4.802083333333333
3614254,1,B001GLLNNA,"This obscure, yet hysterical pablum created by extremist rightwing wacko ideologue John Ziegler reveals how unhinged the conservative element has become in this country.  ""The Path to 9/11"" was edited because it contained demonstrable untruths, but Ziegler doesn't want to admit that inconvenient fact.  Richard Clarke, who has infinitely more credibility and knowledge of the subject than either Ziegler or Nowrasteh has already given the definitive account of the ""path"" to 9/11.  Their fictionalizations are not needed.

Further denting the credibility of this ""documentary"" is the association with Buzz Patterson, who has disgraced himself and the military with his petty, partisan, and discredited books published by hyperpartisan publishers.

But poor, sad John Ziegler.  First he had to broadcast his talk show from a broom closet because KFI wouldn't let him in the door at their studio.  Then, after humiliatingly leaving his broom closet at KFI, he made this pathetic ""documentary"" when it seemed inevitable that Hillary would be the Democratic nominee.  And poor, sad John Ziegler saw all his efforts go right down the toilet when Obama clinched the prize.  The Clintons aren't a particularly relevant topic anymore, even with Hillary as Sec of State.  Ziegler has nothing on Obama, and so his poor, sad attempt at gaining some self-attention this election came to naught.

His latest humiliation came at the hands of Nate Silver, who correctly trashed his biased poll/publicity stunt.  Perhaps Ziegler will someday succeed at something off the golf course.  But I'm not holding my breath.",1228176000,20,1600,5.377510040160643
3614255,5,B001GLLNNA,"This film is an absolute masterpiece.  It is well constructed, evocative, and convincing.  It tells a very important story with FACTS and NOT propaganda!  This is not a Clinton hate movie; it is a documentary on the loss of FREE SPEECH in our country.  The message comes through clear when watching the film.  Most Americans are oblivious to the decline of our true freedom, so thank you Mr. Ziegler, for leading the fight.",1227052800,24,423,4.739726027397261
3614256,5,B001GLLNNA,"This is truly an amazing bit of documentary work, especially for a first effort.  John Ziegler has managed to take a subject which on it's face, may at first seem obscure and tedious, and turn it into something that is absolutely powerful and riveting. Because the subject matter is so engrossing, this film seems much shorter than it actually is.

This film goes way beyond typical conspiracy hype and clearly and masterfully illustrates the corrupt agenda of the Clintons and other politicians as well as the mainstream media at large. The subject matter is at-once both terrifying and nauseating for any intelligent, freedom-loving American.

I was especially impressed that Ziegler was able to obtain such candid and revealing interviews with a number of well-known movie and media professionals. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if a few of these individuals have experienced some sort of retaliation as a result of their candor.

Ziegler is a true champion of free speech.  My hats off to him for having the balls to commit to this endeavor, covering such an important subject, which may have otherwise been ignored. Ziegler definitely has a future as a documentary film-maker - and this one is a ""must see"".",1226880000,73,1214,4.99009900990099
3614257,5,B001GLLNNA,"Not only does ""Blocking The Path To 9/11"" give you a good idea about the way politicians block ""inconvenient truths"" from becoming well known ... it also offers great, interesting insights in show business, where it counts.

The way I see it:  You will n o t be bored. And you will learn a lot in an exciting, entertaining way. This is a professionally produced video - and extremely well done! (I'm a video producer myself, but not in any way involved in this project.)",1226880000,54,470,4.517647058823529
