2786249,5,B000NVLH6W,I love these dvds. They provide a great view into the Atomic Age of the 50's and 60's. If you want to learn more about the U.S. atomic program these dvds are a must.,1297123200,5,165,3.8823529411764706
2786250,5,B000NVLH6W,"First off, Amazon's reviewer Christian St Clair is wrong when he/she says that the Hiroshima bomb was barely one kiloton. That bomb, the ""Little Boy"" uranium gun weapon was actually 13-15 kilotons in strength.

The footage here is amazing. The blasts are as mesmerizing as they are horrifying. The films have been expertly copied and restored and have clarity that is unmatched anywhere. If you want to see how bad some of these films can look, just take a look at un-remastered footage from Department of Defense resources that can be viewed on YouTube and you'll know what Kuran was working with.

If you are interested in the history of atomic weapons and testing, as well as some Cold War Era, this is your one stop collection.",1290038400,5,731,4.748031496062992
2786251,1,B000NVLH6W,Skip it. The production quality is very poor. Nothing substantial in this video. Other titles in the series are just as bad. People writing good reviews for this DVD are probably related to those selling this item.,1266192000,,214,4.8108108108108105
2786252,1,B000NVLH6W,"I wouldn't recommend this product. It is poorly edited and produced.
It safe to say that it is a patch of bits and pieces with no depth.
If you are simply interested on watching nuclear explosion, then this
might be something to consider. For the earlier history of the subject,
I would recommend ""The Moment in Time: The Manhattan Project"" and
you don't have to pay a dime for it. You can watch it on the net.",1247529600,,410,4.337662337662338
2786253,5,B000NVLH6W,"This video is quite insightful and shocking, give a good understanding as to how and why these weapons were produced and tested.",1208736000,2,128,4.863636363636363
2786254,5,B000NVLH6W,The accuarcy and detail of the information in these videos is a very high level. You can watch these over and over again. The music really adds to presentation and the film clips are incredible.,1208476800,9,194,4.571428571428571
2786255,5,B000NVLH6W,"I'll bet there are things you don't know, in this set of videos. It isn't just trivia, the things you will learn inform attitude, and persuade activity. Learning helps me become a more thoughtful citizen, therefore I learn.
Through the lens of time, looking back, there are many attitudes the elites, mostly during Democratic Congresses, believed we ""needed"" to know, and those things we didn't. Overall, it shows a skeptical view the government holds of the ""common"" citizen. The release of the information, albeit, late, is just enough to stop me from having a cynical view.",1207958400,3,576,5.010416666666667
2786256,5,B000NVLH6W,"The information provided in this documentary / ""movie"" is insightful for numerous reasons.  It gives the viewer insight into the thinking of the scientists, military and political leaders of the 1940's, 50's and 60's.  The documentary details why they detonated larger and larger nuclear devices.  Edward Teller explains why he persisted in development of the hydrogen bomb while other physists of the day stopped studying nuclear weapons development. The documentary explains how scientists studied how effective an enemy attack would be on our military and civilian infrastructure, and whether or not a nuclear war was winnable.  Without these tests, future test bans may not have been agreed to, detente' may not have occured, and the decade's long policy of M.A.D., or ""mutually assured destruction"" may never have developed as the overriding political and military policy of the time.  This documentary explains exactly what they looked for in hundreds of tests on military ships, vehicles, shelters, bunkers, etc...  How much destruction would occur?  Could soldiers survive an attack?  How much radiation could a human being absorb and still survive.  Political lefties don't see the value in these tests, but that's because they don't see the danger in our enemies, or the danger in NOT testing nuclear weapons.  This is a must see for high school students.",1201910400,8,1365,5.306976744186047

8182029,5,B000NVLH6W,"I love the footage in this set of DVD's, especially in Trinity and Beyond.  William Shatner does great as a narrator.",1480118400,,117,4.571428571428571

8182033,5,B000NVLH6W,"This is a great set of documentary films about the early nuclear weapons work. As a one time nuclear physicist in the industry, it's nice to have declassified material that's reasonably accurate. That said, the official government commentaries/narration is sometimes condescending, officious, and banal.",1439424000,3,303,5.909090909090909
