3936346,4,B002IGHX2W,".... very nice scenery if you love rails and scenery.  I did read a review prior to purchase that commented on the reflection of the trains windshield.  I did not think it would make much of a difference, but had the windshield been ** cleaned ** prior to filming the 1080P hi-def would have been much sharper.  It is very easy seeing the dirty windshield that reduces the image quality.  Other than that, a very good DVD, very nice scenery.",1339113600,,441,4.475
3936347,5,B002IGHX2W,"I have been a train buff for all my 67 years.
This was one of the best videos I have seen.
The sounds are great and so is the music if you choose to play it.
But if you are looking for a commentary while it plays describing the trains, routes , etc. , then this is not the video for you.
It is best described the the title ""Moods"".
Several routes and spectacular scenery.
A must for a train buff.",1327017600,3,396,3.9012345679012346
3936348,5,B002IGHX2W,"I bought this because I like trains and the price was low, however I did not expect to be as pleasantly surprised as I was.  The visuals are absolutely outstanding, I also purchased ""Scenic National Parks Great Train Rides"" but this is far superior in visuals and in the selection of shots.  Its obvious to me that the producer absolutely loves trains.  And if you put the soundtrack on it becomes very soothing.  I've only had it for two days and have watched it all the way through three times.  I've also noticed that even though this comes under the HD Moods series the actual producer is someone who films trains independently and who really knows how to get great shots.

Oh, and a nice little extra is in the options menu: you can watch a looped clip of the other HD Moods films with relaxing music playing in the background which is a real plus.  I let it play for sometimes up to half an hour after watching the feature.  The automatic loop makes it really condusive to just sitting back and relaxing to the exquisite images (all in HD).

If you have even the slightest interest in trains or just like very beautiful mountain passes and rivers, then get this one right away.",1304121600,4,1183,4.465116279069767
3936349,5,B002IGHX2W,"Just watched this 68 minute Blu-Ray DVD for the first time. Photography is fantastic. If you're expecting to be educated about steam trains, you won't find that here..... just pretty train video with your choice of music and/or train sounds. I think about six different lines were featured. One reviewer complained about glare on the window. It was an out-the-front-window view (diesel, even though you never saw the locomotive) of the White Pass and Yukon RR out of Skagway, Alaska. To me, it was not the least bit distracting, even though you could see an occasional reflection.

BTW, I run a 105 year old steam locomotive several times a year. If you're interested in lots of detailed information about running steam locomotives, from starting the fire to actual operation, check out the 3 DVD collection available from Amazon&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Running-A-Steam-Locomotive-Vol-1-3/dp/B000AEN9B8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Running A Steam Locomotive Vol 1-3</a>.",1298160000,13,1020,5.986301369863014
3936350,5,B002IGHX2W,"After seeing the dvd at a large wholesaler , i tried to get this dvd numerous times and it was always out of stock.. i finally searched through Bing and Amazon.com had it listed in about 4 places... i am very pleased with the service and vendor who shipped it to me...",1265155200,,268,4.173076923076923
3936351,1,B002IGHX2W,"Nice trains but crappy sound. Where does ""moods"" come in. Sounds is like they recorded it a mile away. Can barely hear it. Just expected something more professional instead of someone chasing trains with a camcorder.

I am afraid now to buy any more ""mood"" dvd.",1261353600,3,261,4.673913043478261
3936352,1,B002IGHX2W,"I have a brand new Blu-Ray player and I have a dozen Blu-Ray disks and they all work except this disk (HD Moods: Trains).  I sent the first disk back and order a second (HD Moods: Trains), it won't play either.
Anyway be warned that this disk might not play.",1260316800,4,258,4.16
3936353,1,B002IGHX2W,"This is a poor use of disk space. The footage is often breathtaking, however it is often shot through the glass of the train window, with streeks/reflections visible between the camera and the view. Furthermore there was no attempt to edit the sound as would have been expected, thus the sound of the dispatcher can be heard when the camera was stationed in the engineer's position. Not recommended.",1259798400,2,399,4.882352941176471
3936354,5,B002IGHX2W,"This outstanding cross section of various types of surviving steam engines, as well as some off the beaten track railroads is just marvelous, one of the most picturesque, and entertaining that I have seen. High def video quality is excellent, and for the modest price, a real bargain, I hope to see more like this in the future.",1256169600,6,328,4.672413793103448
3936355,5,B002IGHX2W,"This is an extraordinarily great Blu-ray bargain for the price.  This picture quality is very sharp, and I believe of Blu-ray reference quality. The cinematography is professionally done by a photographer who obviously loves his work.  The quality lends itself to an almost 3-D feeling when watching the trains and scenery.

We see lots of steam trains including some on the Cumbres & Toltec and the Durango & Silverton in Colorado's San Juan mountains.  There is also a section of breath-taking photography from the front of the engine (cab ride) on a spectacular mountain climbing railroad in Alaska and British Columbia.",1254441600,7,623,5.138613861386139

8370884,5,B002IGHX2W,"Well photographed and produced, lots of beautiful scenes with snow. Well worth the purchase price.  To my surprise I found the same blue ray at the dollar store. I can not understand why this very enjoyable dvd ended up there.",1394582400,,226,4.65
8370885,5,B002IGHX2W,"Beautifuly done, I am a train buff, and have photographed many trains over the years in 16mm and Kodachrome slides. I knew and have ridden or photographed most of the trains featured, but nothing brough back to life like this DVD Wow! The only thing I would call a con is the fact the producers jumped around too much in editing it. I have produced a few films in the past on 16mm Kodachrome, and sold a few but I concentrated on each loco and train as I chased them. If I was not savvy on which loco ran on which RR I would be confused when you jump from Colorado to Alaska and back, it was anoying to me. But again I was familier with the trains and location, but the scenes and photography are first class!",1385424000,2,709,4.144927536231884
