8626258,5,B00GQRMJPK,"Ramon has been delivering Kettlebell courses for Personal Trainers all over the world, and was lucky enough to learn from him in person back in 2010.
Kettlebells are a tremendous training tool if used correctly, however having been in the Fitness Industry since 1995 it's rare to see them being used and coached to their full potential.

As in these DVDs, Ramon understands when the body presents us with muscular inhibitions there is a process required to get the body functioning efficiently, effectively and free from the shackles of poor technique.
Ramon delivers clear instruction on how to integrate correction exercises to allow this to happen to get you and your clients to get the most out of this fantastic training tool.

The Fitness industry offers 1000s of training DVDs which often over promises and under delivers, but not here.
Learn the processes Ramon employees and your clients will thank you for it.

Highly recommended for anyone using Kettlebells. An essential purchase for Personal Trainers.",1386979200,,1014,5.133333333333334
8626259,5,B00GQRMJPK,"There are so many programs in the world for all sorts of different types of personal training regiments, alternative personal training tools (like Kettlebells), and get fit/skinny/trim/toned programs!

I figured this one would be just one more to add to the pile of useless crap I've got stacked on my shelf that, after the first time watching, ends up gathering dust in the corner of my room until I decide to do a garage sale and sell them for pennies on the dollar.  I hate doing this, especially in a public forum, but I was completely wrong.

After having utilized the Kettlebell as a really effective vehicle in my own personal workouts, I decided (against my better judgement) to pursue mastering this incredible health device.  After sifting through the worst that's out there, I can tell you without a shadow of a doubt that this will be one hell of an investment on a couple of conditions.  1)  You actually watch it!  2)  You actually do what it says!  3)  You rinse and repeat that process until mastery!

Ramon (even with his Aussie accent) does a fabulous job at breaking down and explaining each step in the process of mastering advanced kettlebell lifts.  With the use of great visualizations and demos, I could track my own progress easily with each lift I practiced in succession and even in my trouble spots, I could watch the video and clearly see where to correct my own movements.  I'd like to personally say ""Thank you!"" to Ramon for making what I had assumed would be a nightmare tough experience into a walk in the park.",1386288000,,1545,4.636029411764706
