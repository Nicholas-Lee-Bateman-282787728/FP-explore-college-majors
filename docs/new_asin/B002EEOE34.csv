3916897,1,B002EEOE34,My wife and I walked out of this piece of crap about an hour into it. This was right after Alison Lohman does something horrible to her cat. I am disappointed in Sam Raimi. He should work on Spiderman 4 or get back together with Bruce Cambell and make a good movie. I had to give it a star but it does not deserve even half a star.,1243641600,7,331,3.8823529411764706
3916898,4,B002EEOE34,"First of All, for a ""dissenting"" opinion and a review of this review, please check out my friend Karen Shaub's review. This film never met her expectations and she wanted to see that Raimi has grown. Her review is a great comparison to Raimi's past work, may give you an idea of what you may NOT like about this film, that Raimi has faltered in her expectations, as well as a rebuttal to this review. However, if you just want to read details as to how this film plays out, may have seen the film for what it is (which is basically a dumbed-down silly film and doesn't pretend to be anything else) and are just in for pure fun in a film with demonic overtones--Read on.

Known to mainstream audiences as the director of the blockbuster franchise ""Spider-Man"", but loved by cult horror junkies as the director of the ""Evil Dead"" franchise; arguably the cheesiest, funniest, most delightful films in the history of splatter horror cinema. Sam Raimi returns to his roots since his absence from the horror genre in the 90`s, and ""Drag Me to Hell"" is a film that plays upon the audiences' obsession with the supernatural, demonic curses, and the occult. No one can play on our obsession with the occult better than Sam Raimi--No one. ""DRAG ME TO HELL"" is his welcome return to the horror genre.

A farmer girl turned loaning officer named Christine (Alison Lohman) is determined to win a promotion within the bank branch she works in. Her Boss wants her to make the tough decisions, and so when she is asked by a creepy, unkempt old gypsy (Lorna Raver) to extend the payments to the mortgage to her home, Christine refuses. Angered and humiliated, the old crone stalks Christine and ends up cursing her--so who would believe such things? Christine just wants to get her life on track with her boyfriend, Clay (Justin Long) but now, mysterious things begin to happen. Christine begins to have nightmares, and experiences hallucinations. Now time is slowly ticking away for Christine, as the curse of an invisible demon is hot on her trail and it would drag her soul to the netherworld after three days.

""Drag Me To Hell"" is classic Sam Raimi, the film is astonishingly so familiar that the film feels and plays like a throwback from Raimi's past. It is one gorgeously silly, goofy elegy to gothic schmaltz and it never pretends to be anything else. The film is a bit ""bombastic"" in its style but Raimi makes everything work. Demonic possessions, ghouls, shadowy demons, frenzied slapstick humor, cheeky comedy, flying witches, malevolent unseen entities that threaten to kill mere mortals--all the successful elements that made the ""Evil Dead"" successful are omnipresent in the film. Even the invisible fast moving first person view chase sequence is compressed into the film. All the charm and cheesy fun is repackaged into this film, Hell, it is so familiar that it unbelievably feels like a homage to Raimi's past work in horror.

However, the bucket-loads of fake blood and the intentional gratuitous scenes of gore in ""Evil Dead"" are curiously gone from the film. ""Drag Me To Hell"" has great production values, and obviously the film has a larger budget than ""Evil Dead"", with some use of CGI, and fortunately, it may be as hilarious as the ""Evil Dead"" series. I have heard rumors that there are two cuts of the film, a PG-13 version and another that is R-rated. This film may or may not be a `cleaner' version, and after watching the film, I do think there may be a more gruesome cut since the film has several plot missteps, but this flaw doesn't necessarily hamper the film too much. It may have been toned down on the blood and gore to appease PG-13 viewers, Raimi manages to keep the film at an even pace, all the while maintaining his horror sensibilities.

Raimi maintaining his sensibilities and style is a very good thing. The film with its very simple set ups, basic plot devices, would be very mediocre it wasn't for Raimi. His flair for nauseating scene gags, darkly comedic dialogue, precise timing and delivery, then the film would be very ordinary. Honestly, the film's screenplay offers nothing new to the horror genre, and does nothing to reinvent the horror genre. There is a sance scene, a kitty and a cat named Hecuba, dramatic crashes of lightning, a graveyard exhumation with organ riffs; all these formulas have been done numerous times, but no one does better than Sam Raimi. The stapled eyelid, toothless biting, puking loads of blood, projectile secretion gags, clonks and bumps--the film is so hilariously awesome in the way it makes everything work. Mrs. Ganush's barfs are so hilariously nasty that it may be one of the film's highlights.

The cast plays their respective roles with a lot of zest and gusto. Alison Lohman goes from charming to petrified as soon as she gets `cursed'. It should also be noted that her character displayed some nice doses of comedic bloodlust, and the mighty puke of blood. Lorna Daver is the personification of raw nasty ""toothless"" indignation, her Mrs. Ganush character is hilariously creepy, for an old gypsy. Daver almost stole the show from Lohman, her scenes may be the film's major selling point. The overused boyfriend is played by Justin Long, and while his character may sometimes feel unnecessary, he did what he was supposed to do, and that is to ease the film's non-humorous horror sequences. Newcomer Dileep Rao plays the overmatched psychic who defines the details of curse and its unforgiving nature, and special thanks would have to be given to the goat--no farm animals were harmed during filming.

The film isn't your high-minded indictment of this country's mortgage system, and it is so predictable; you can see the twist coming from the beginning of the last act. Yet, despite its many plot missteps, the film manages to sidestep its many plot fumbles by maintaining its energy, humor and charm. Fans are privy to classic Sam Raimi and be on the look out for a yellow Oldsmobile and for a fly that flies around Christine that ends up on the camera lens. The film has all the ingredients of a Sam Raimi B-movie supernatural hookey that revels in its own absurdity. It delivers the goods--it never pretends that it is anything else. I'm just happy to see him return to form, after his absolute misfire, Spider-man 3. So the next time an old gypsy barfs and spits bile onto the desk of a loaning officer, give her what she wants.

Sam Raimi is Back.

3916899,5,B002EEOE34,"This is a great movie, I had a hell of a lot of fun. Definitely as good as the best of the old-school horror films, and plenty of laughs too. The audience in the theater I saw it in were going crazy. A perfect date movie.",1243641600,5,221,3.8260869565217392
3916900,4,B002EEOE34,"This is Sam Raimi's return to the horror genre, in case you hadn't heard that in the trailer or anything else promoting the film. Drag Me To Hell has already had such an overwhelmingly positive response when it comes to feedback and the truth of the matter is that the film is genuinely that entertaining. Not only did Sam Raimi return to the horror genre, but he did it so flawlessly and without missing a beat. He's on top of his game and, dare I say, the best he's ever been. The film only seemed to get better as it progressed. It's somehow capable of combining comedy, suspense, romance, and horror all into one amazing final product. A film that can do something like make you laugh out loud one minute, scare you the next, gross you out after that, and tear at your heartstrings is something special. And it's not like the film does that one time and calls it quits. It goes through that cycle (laugh, scare, gross, heartwarming) over and over again throughout the film. Sam Raimi has struck cinematic gold.

Drag Me To Hell is a hell of a lot of fun. It truly has something to offer anyone looking for a good time at the movies. Not only is the film based on an original story, but it's an original story that is worth being told, worth listening to, and incredibly entertaining. Originality seems to be extinct when it comes to horror these days. It's just so refreshing to see a film that not only isn't a remake, but drenches itself in the fact that it offers something new. Sam Raimi has delivered a cinematic feature that has rejuvenated what we once referred to as ""the horror film."" Let's hope that other filmmakers can tread the same path that he has paved the way with.",1243555200,2,1686,4.438709677419355
3916901,4,B002EEOE34,"When I first saw this in the theaters, I posted a somewhat disappointed review.  I wanted something more demented - more like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Evil-Dead/dp/B00005R24K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Evil Dead</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Army-of-Darkness/dp/0783227434/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Army of Darkness</a>.  I just saw it again with my older kids and my wife and they loved it, they were scared and laughing at the same time.  This time, in that frame of mind, I loved it too.  Just think, this is scary funny horror Raimi style - but designed for the mainstream audience and not the cult geeks like me, and then you realize this is a minor horror masterpiece.  The only thing comparable out there is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Frighteners/dp/078322799X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Frighteners</a>&nbsp;(which may be somewhat more twisted than this one, but still somewhat accessible and designed to please).

Christine Brown (Allison Lohman) is an ambitious loan officer, who ends up denying a loan extension to an aging gypsy who curses her to be dragged to hell by a shadowy demon. She has three days to somehow break the curse, but the demon's attacks go from scary to much worse. There is a subplot that involves a boyfriend (Justin Long, the mac guy) whose mother thinks Christine is not worthy of her son - but just when the tension in that story starts to look pivotal to the theme it is mostly dropped and the troubles between them are hastily resolved. There are several scary silly set pieces, that suggest a return to the The Evil Dead stylings that made Raimi famous - but what struck me is that each such scene seemed to go only so far; each seemed to escalate to a certain point and then resolve itself fairly quickly. Still, there are some very scary moments and some great images, that often manage both to shock and elicit giggles.  Good stuff - a great introduction to the idea of horror as comedy.",1243555200,,2102,5.67515923566879
3916902,5,B002EEOE34,"I can't believe I'm going to say this but Drag Me to Hell is one of my favorite movies of the year so far. I thought this Sam Raimi gem would get mixed reviews at best, so I was blown away when I saw the 100 or so positive reviews flowing in from critics. It's only behind UP and Star Trek as the best reviewed movie of the year. That rarely happens with a horror film, but this one is so much more. It's full of dark humor, gross out gags (really pushes the PG-13 envelope), good acting, nice SFX and an interesting story. I can't remember the last time I was this surprised at how much better the movie was than any of the trailers or what I had expected going in.

Alison Lohman really sold me here. She is very cute, but she shows the smarts and toughness you almost never see in a horror flick. Really good stuff from her. The whole cast from Justin Long to the evil gypsy lady is spot on and you can't leave out director Sam Raimi. His visual style here will remind you of The Evil Dead trilogy, but with a bigger budget and just as much creativeness. It was great to see this now summer blockbuster director go back to his roots and knock it out of the park. The music and sound effects are some of the best I've heard in a long time. When it goes from quiet to extremely loud, the sound alone will make you jump. Out of all the movies I have seen in theaters, I can't remember one with sound mixing this good.

Well, do you think I liked Drag Me to Hell just a little bit? Really? Sorry Star Trek, but you will have to reside in my #2 spot for the moment, because when it comes to horror films (especially in recent years), few pack the thrills, laughs and entertainment that this one brings.

4 and 1/2 out of 5 star",1243555200,5,1725,4.0825958702064895
3916903,4,B002EEOE34,"Though separated by a seventeen year break and an understandably larger budget from his Evil Dead series (Army of Darkness finished the trilogy in 1992), Sam Raimi's unmistakable style clearly commands every facet of his return to the genre that made him legendary. Infusing nauseating repugnance (but little gore) and wildly dark humor with every scare, Drag Me to Hell revels in its own excesses, creating a hilariously frightful battle of demons and young girls, morality and talking goats.

Desperate to acquire the coveted Assistant Manager position at the Wilshire Pacific Bank, loan officer Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) chooses to evict an old Gypsy lady from her home. Shamed and enraged, the vengeful woman curses Christine with the Lamia, a goat-like demon sent to take her to hell after three days of torment. Quickly running out of time, the terrified but determined girl must fend off the supernatural beast - and wage war with her own soul if she wishes to save it.

A nonstop bombardment of jump scares is usually overbearingly traumatizing - the beauty behind Sam Raimi's direction is the humor which fortunately and frequently follows every moment of intense shock. The scares are fast-paced, unforgivingly abrasive, steeping with anticipation, preceded by lengthy moments of silence (the calm before the storm) and backed by brutally loud, sudden sound effects with amplified music (classically headed by screeching violins). Drag Me To Hell is engrossingly horrifying and simultaneously utterly hilarious. It's entirely predictable but completely effective. Raimi's other trademarks of horror direction are also present; lots of bodily fluids and slimy locations, creepy-crawlies (flies and maggots), invasive close-ups and spiraling, zooming camera-work.

It's also refreshing to see a strong female lead character, even though they are indeed most commonly found in gross-out horror films. Christine is immediately the target of subtle sexism and a competitive male environment, so it's especially satisfying that she demonstrates commendable backbone, taking matters into her own hands and bravely coping with attacks from her invisible assailant. Drag Me To Hell reuses a familiar, repetitive formula for fright flicks, but with it's competent blend of thrills and laughs its one of the most solidly entertaining films of the summer and a triumphant return to nail-biting horror for a director who became famous for his bold and recognizable scary movie methodology.

After a couple of viewings, I put away the comparisons and have accepted ""Drag Me to Hell"" as an instant classic in its own right.  Brilliant and haunting musical score, too.

Horror movies are only scary when they have some level of plausibility. I can't believe the Lohan sisters are allowed to make the money they do. They can't act to save a kitty.

the plot

Christine Brown has come a long way since her younger days as a pudgy, pig-tailed girl living on a farm.  She may even feel that she has to prove herself more than the natives here in Pasadena California.  She has been working at the same job as a loan officer in a bank for years, yet when a promotion situation shows itself, she finds that she must still compete with a new co-worker who has only been here for mere weeks.  So, to prove that she has the kind of backbone her boss would admire enough to promote, she denies a third extension on a poor old lady's mortgage.

Although, the old lady, Sylvia Ganush, knew she had done wrong, she kind of expected everything to go alright, and when Christine denied her, Mrs. Ganush finds herself on her knees in the bank begging Christine to reconsider.  When Christine still refuses, Mrs. Ganush vows revenge via an evil gypsy spell.  The spell that was cast upon Christine Brown was the spell of the Lamia.  This is when the evil Goat demon spirit haunts you for three days and then on the last day, literally drags you to Hell.

Christine confides in her fianc and they enlist the help of a psychic with a storefront.  The psychic, Rham Jas eventually leads them to a medium named Shaun San Dena, whom luckily also had experience with this goat demon 40 years earlier, when the Lamia dragged a small Mexican boy to hell in her very own home.  Could this little old Latina rid the demon curse on Christine?  Is there anyway to escape Hell?  Find out when you watch Drag Me To Hell.

the breakdown

I've only seen a handful of horror movies (The Uninvited, The Haunting of Molly Hartley, The House of the Devil, and more) this year and for the most part they were downright terrible.  Watching Drag Me To Hell was a pleasure as it actually had some creepy scenes designed to make you jump out of your seat.  Was it actually scary?  That is an opinion based on the individual, but I didn't find it particularly scary.  Although I did enjoy the film it was hard to make the connection.  I found myself saying, ""That would be scary if that happened to me"", yet I didn't feel scared when it happened to Christine Brown.

There was a disconnection that was present due to Alison Lohman, the actress playing Christine.  Neither her presence nor her behavior in this film was capable of any emphatic feelings from the audience or me.  Yet, her character of Christine Brown behaved in the same way director Sam Rami's cast had done in Evil Dead.  In those Evil Dead movies it was easier to accept the erratic and irrational actions because of the setting.  Drag Me To Hell kind of takes one of these characters and now places them in social situations like at a job behind the desk, on a date meeting the parents, or at a diner counter drinking coffee.  It's an interesting contrast, yet it still manufactured a setting where the viewer cannot become engrossed in the film.  Invested? Yes - but not a part of it.

David Paymer and Justin Long appear in this movie and against type, although Paymer did appear in the Ghosts video by Michael Jackson.  Their roles are small but again the contrast of their normal world clashing with the supernatural is thought-provoking at the least, and very interesting to watch.  As I said above, this movie will make you squirm in your seat as you watch.  Christine Brown seems to get a mouth load of one disgusting thing after another here.  There are flies flying up her nose, in her mouth, embalming fluid down her throat, a vat full of larvae and more.  Yet I have to admit, Ms. Brown is a trooper who knows how to roll with the punches.  Also more than the scares are the laughs in this film.  Sam Rami always had a good sense of humor and the cast to bring it to fruition.

I did expect a lot from this film, and I was happy with what was before me on my HDTV monitor.  I said above in the bottom line that this was the best horror movie I've seen this year and although that's true, I admit that I haven't seen Paranormal Activity yet, and that is another film I expect a lot from.  From the beginning to the very end was exciting to watch.  My favorite aspect was the clashing of the natural and supernatural, something that a movie like Jason Goes to Manhattan may have tried to get across, yet failed.  I like when my horror movies are supernatural in essence and so this will be a movie I'll be watching every Halloween.  I was happy that the language wasn't out of control, maybe just a handful of the lesser offensive variety of profamity at most.  This is something that the whole family can watch on those scary Halloween nights, as long as the kids are about 11 years old and up.

3916945,5,B002EEOE34,Awesome movie I used idea of gypsy woman and patterned my Halloween costume for work after it. Even left my teeth out for photographs from my fellow employees.,1496707200,,159,4.714285714285714
3916946,5,B002EEOE34,"Very much like the Evil Dead and Army of Darkness, but with a new  story-line.  Thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish.",1492300800,,122,4.761904761904762
3916947,3,B002EEOE34,"Unrealistic reactions from the characters. And the characters aren't very likable either. But if you like movies about curses, this movie can pass the time. But the main character makes stupid choices so it's frustrating.",1491955200,,221,5.3428571428571425
3916948,5,B002EEOE34,"I can see that a lot of reviewers here don't seem to get Sam Raimi. That's okay as his style isn't for everyone. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie including all the cool and over the top Raimi-isms, if you will. Great acting jobs all round with Alison Lohman as ""Christine"" hitting just the right notes as a basically good person who is just trying to get a job promotion at the bank she works at. Also Justin Long who plays the loving but clueless boyfriend plays it low-key as he should as the focus is on ""Christine"" and her slide down the final slippery slope. Unfortunately she burns the wrong gypsy woman played to great effect by Lorna Raver, what a treat. Also Dileep Rao is stellar as the helpful medium who tries to help ""Christine"" break the curse. Great atmospheric tone to the movie along with haunting gypsy violin music and a truly scary Lamia goat demon and what's not to like? If you like ""curse"" movies as much as I do this is a must see. Also check out ""Curse of The Demon"", the 1958 film starring Dana Andrews and directed by the master Jaques Torneur for another great ""curse"" film with great atmosphere and story.",1491264000,,1133,4.451923076923077

3916955,4,B002EEOE34,I liked this movie when I saw on TV.  I wanted to watch without commercials.  It's creepy when you see this creature's shadow moving along the walls.  For three days the gypsy woman haunts her until the end.  You never know what's going to happen next in this movie.  Actors are great!,1487289600,,285,4.403846153846154

3916960,2,B002EEOE34,"Everyone who watches a horror movie has a different hope/expectation and because of that will probably walk away with a different conclusion than others as well. This movie was recommended to me by a friend who loved it and said it was super scary. Although, I thought the movie was well made, but I found it more similar to comedy horror like ""Cabin in the Woods"" than anything that was actually meant to scare. Because I was expecting something quite different (and am not a fan of the satirical/comedy horror genre) I can't say that I enjoyed watching this movie at all. If you are a fan of that type of horror then you will probably like this film.",1483660800,,652,4.487394957983193

3916966,5,B002EEOE34,"Fun, clever, disgusting. Most hilarious part: when the heroine is trapped in her car with the angry gypsy woman. Gypsy's false teeth pop out of her mouth and she ends up gumming the heroine's chin.",1480982400,,197,4.6571428571428575

3916980,4,B002EEOE34,"This is your basic Sam Raimi product, which means it's pretty good. It's sort of scary, but not really. It's pretty funny, as an Evil Dead, over the top, slapstick parody type thing. If you like Evil Dead, Army of Darkness, low-budget effects, dark humor, than this will work for you.",1474329600,,284,4.588235294117647
3916981,2,B002EEOE34,"The only reason this movie gets even 2 stars is because the acting is very good.  The premise is ridiculous and the gore is horrendously overdone.  Nice try but if you're looking for something more cerebral and less bloody, go elsewhere.  If all you care about are special effects, then this is for you.  p.s.

3917010,4,B002EEOE34,"Its pretty campy.  It depends on pure grossness a lot, and the usual campy horror effects (loud soundtrack noises when the boogey man pops out, high pitched violins when the atmosphere is supposed to be creepy).

3917014,4,B002EEOE34,"After a long break away from the genre Sam Raimi returns to horror films with Drag Me to Hell. With a script written by both Sam & Ted Raimi this is a very good supernatural horror film. Basic plot is an employee at a bank refuses to help an old Gypsy woman & gets cursed for it. Now she must figure out a way to undo what was done. Alison Lohman & Justin Long were very good as the 2 leads, the actress playing the old Gypsy woman did a great job too, very creepy performance. The effects were good for the most part but in a couple of scenes the CGI could've been better. There is also some great atmosphere here, especially in the sance scene, that had to be one of my favorite parts of the movie. Some chilling & unsettling things also happen through out the film. The disc includes both the theatrical & unrated cuts of the film but sadly the only other feature present are production video diaries. If you are looking for an entertaining supernatural horror film, check out Drag Me to Hell.",1459123200,3,996,4.275132275132275

3917018,3,B002EEOE34,"I liked it well enough for what it was, and relentlessly nihilistic and cruel story. The lead lady pisses off an old gypsy witch and is cursed for it. This definitely has Sam Rami's fingerprints all over it, with the scenes of the demon tormenting the girl more humorous and slap sticky than horrifying. Unfortunately, there are bits of really noticeable CGI that could have just as easily used practical effects. Doesn't ruin the film, but it still a sorry sight to see.",1457568000,,471,4.686746987951807

3917042,5,B002EEOE34,"This is a very fun, campy horror movie. If that sentence makes you furrow your brow, move along, this movie is not for you. However, for those familiar with Sam Raimi's previous horror films, this is an awesome, modern, and more mature take on his old classics. It's acted well, there are some pretty good tense, jump scare moments, and the ending is horrible through and through.

A young girl Bank employee who dreams of raising, forced to serve old woman. Seemingly, what's so unusual? But this unusual woman. She looks disgusting and repulsive. The Bank's management already knows about it and is not going to make concessions. The main character put it in popularity and it denies an old woman an extension of the deferral. That's all. But no!

At almost every chance they got, they made this old lady's mouth connect openly to the pretty young starring lady. With plenty of fluid exchange going on. On effects I'll have to give this a 4 and a half star rating. . Good job of cinematography. Now to put this all together, it's got a lot of cheesy parts with really nothing new. And if it was truly scary enough, they wouldn't have to blast the volume abnormally high to intensify effect. This is probably going to be most enjoyed by the younger teen bracket.

One good thing is if you already own a movie and if it isn't Ultraviolet then you're given the option of paying a conversion fee of $2.00 dollars for SD and $5.00 dollars for HD.

3917159,5,B002EEOE34,"Very entertaining even though it's not at all scary.

There are a lot of comedic and very campy moments. The old gypsy woman and the exorcist rock. Poor thing, she can't get a break.
The dinner scene with the boyfriends parents is hysterical and the final exorcism scene is very entertaining.
She's a loan officer at a bank who turns down an extension for an old gypsy woman who curses her. The ensuing attack scene in the garage is a gut buster, especially those crazy dentures.
Basically she's stuck with a cursed object and for some strange reason doesn't pass it off to the a** kissing jerk from her office who stole her account.
Being familiar with office politics, I found that final act of compassion rather puzzling.

However she DID murder her pet cat, so I wasn't particularly sympathetic with her demise at the end.

Now, why her boyfriend was still planning on taking her to his family vacation home for the weekend after that disastrous dinner and confirming the mother's worst fears about her suitability as a candidate for marriage to her precious boy is a mystery to me as well.

That mother (oh man, you know the type, unless you pass muster, she's the mother-in-law from Hell and Back!), besides she'd never have let that marriage happen anyway. She'd stay up night and day scheming to get ""the little girl from the farm"" out of the picture.

3917179,4,B002EEOE34,"This latest horror flick from director, Sam Raimi, constitutes his return to his horror roots after his phenomenal success with his cult classic, The Evil Dead, that launched his career as a film director that enabled him to venture into mainstream TV series such as Hercules and Xena: The Warrior Princess and, eventually, onto the silver screen with the ever popular block buster Spiderman trilogy, and revolves around a loan officer, Christine Brown (Alison Lohman, the ever pretty and adorable blonde) - who due to her desire for a promotion, turns down a gypsy's request for an extension on her housing loan due to her boss' inability to decide between her and a new loan officer in the form of a ruthless and obnoxious Chinese man, and, in so doing, spurs the gypsy to violently confront her in the car park and curse an object belonging to her with the Lamia (a goat like demon) that terrorizes her into seeking the help of a fortune teller and, resultant of his advice, slaughters her beloved pet cat in an attempt to appease the demon to no avail, thereby, spurring her eventually to pawn her possession to raise sufficient capital to consort with a medium who had wrangled with the demon three decades ago; only to find herself falling short of the required funds, thereby, inducing her skeptical boyfriend to finance the failed exorcism on behalf of his traumatized girlfriend - which spurs her to attempt to part with the accursed object by digging up the gypsy's grave (for the latter had passed away) as a last resort; only to discover that she had shoved her boyfriend's mint coin into the gypsy's mouth in a mix-up that finds her boyfriend returning the accursed object to her and the Lamia dragging her to hell.

With a well written screenplay, scripted by the Raimi brothers, excellent CGI, visual and special effects, a brilliant musical score and sound effects, this brilliantly directed tour du force by director Sam Raimi will have you thinking twice before you turn away someone's plea for help in order to secure a promotion and financial gain.

There's almost no way to watch this one at night if people are sleeping. When it's just people talking normally, it's fine but once you start getting bombarded with jump scares and general craziness happening on screen, it gets out of hand. The movie is meant to be like this so one can't really complain but it has to be mentioned. That being said, this is a killer mix with great picture to boot. I like this film quite a bit actually. Sam Raimi delivers a funny/scary take on the cursed victim genre of horror films, with Alison Lohman giving a strong performance in the lead. The extras on this disc include a half hour making of that's good if not great. You also get both the theatrical and slightly more disgusting unrated Director's cut to choose from.

This film is a good callback to the Sam Raimi of old, the same guy who gave us the Evil Dead Trilogy. If you want a fun yet creepy horror flick to tide you over, look no further.

Raimi delights in both disgusting his audience and making them laugh (never have I seen so much swallowing and/or regurgitating of evil effluvium).

He can't act and dragged down the concerned boyfriend role as he showed no concern becasue he again cannot act.

3917235,3,B002EEOE34,"I don't go into movies like this expecting a lot. I figured the cast was pretty good. Sam Rami is a decent director, and I could tell from the previews the special effects were OK. The movie was mildly entertaining. The biggest problem with it, and most horror films is that more often than not, people die from their own stupidity. It's hard to empathize with people who constantly make poor decisions. If a character makes good decisions and is overtaken by a superior force then you can empathize with them, and it feels more real. Or, if they overcome that superior force with their wits (like Ripley in Alien for example) then you really get engaged. This movie works on the incorrect premise that people in dangerous situations take enormous stupid risks all the time, and that the viewer will somehow find that engaging.",1382832000,,827,4.710344827586207

3917237,2,B002EEOE34,"This wasn't supposed to be a comedy, but the acting was so badly done that scenes that should have been very frightening were instead funny.  Alison Lohman showed no believable fright in the few supposedly scary scenes in the movie, ruining the opportunity.  The seance was the most ridiculously laughable part of the movie, with the person possessed by the Lamia demon dancing in mid-air as if at a barn dance.  Oh, and don't forget the split pea soup belching forth from the old gypsy woman directly into Lohman's mouth in not just one but several scenes -- it was a good special effect when Linda Blair did it in The Exorcist in 1973, but just doesn't have the same impact in a 2009 movie (especially when used SEVERAL times).

Cmon make me feel good? No? Ok then was the point of this movie written to piss me off? Because it did.
The old evil lady dies of natural causes and the sweet young innocent girl that killed a kitty gets...dragged to hell?

Huh?

What no comeback?
No retribution?
I wanted the old lady to pay, I wanted pay back. I wanted moments of righteous kick ass.

None of that here. Sorry, next sucker.

""Oh I see what you did there...""

Thats not entertainment. Thats disappointment.
What exactly were the makers of the movie trying to achieve? Don't they watch movies? Don't they know what sells?

Here I spell it out for free.

What works:
1) Good guy in the wrong place at the wrong time.
2) Good guy's family gets slaughtered and almost dies.
3) Good guy comes back ""from the dead"".
4) Good guy takes revenge and kicks serious ass and everyone cheers.
5) Good guy walks off into the sunset.
6) The end.

What doesn't work:
1) Good girl in the wrong place at the wrong time.
2) Good girl gets cursed and tormented by an evil old bitch.
3) Good girl suffers and gets ""dragged to hell""
4) The end.

So when and if ""Drag Me to Hell II"" comes out, you know what happens.

edit:
I can even think of a really cool line.
""Hey bitch! You made me kill my kitty!!..."" <splat with a shovel to the gums>

3917257,4,B002EEOE34,"3.5 Stars. This movie had quite a few things going for it. It had a good budget, good story, good cast and fantastic music. The problem was Sam Raimi. He finally received some money to make a movie and he went overboard. I loved all of Sam's low budget creations and he should have stuck with that formula while making minor upgrades with his newly acquired budget. The major problem here was the CGI. I found that the computerized special effects took away from the story. The graphics were extremely unnecessary and distracting adding nothing to the film. In fact, had those effects been toned down a bit and maybe done without the CGI they would have been better. An example of this was where the main character started bleeding at work. The CGI blood looked completely fake and the amount was absolutely ridiculous. Just the nose-bleed would have been perfect. The implications of using that fake CGI blood took away from the story in the fact that after this bleeding occurred, why didn't anyone help her, call the police, stop her from leaving or give any concern for her well being? Especially after all that blood loss! If they left that scene with her just having a nose-bleed it would have added to, not taken from, the story and gotten the point across that something was wrong. Sometimes simplicity is best. So a possible 4-5 star movie gets taken down just because of CGI overuse. Maybe Sam should stick with a lower budget.",1369958400,3,1437,4.661417322834645
3917258,4,B002EEOE34,"If you are familiar with Sam Ramie work then you will  appreciate this movie.

3917259,5,B002EEOE34,"""Drag Me To Hell"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Christine Brown is an ambitious L.A. loan officer with a charming boyfriend, professor Clay Dalton. Life is good until the mysterious Mrs. Ganush arrives at the bank to beg for an extension on her home loan. Should Christine follow her instincts and give the old woman a break? Or should she deny the extension to impress her boss, Mr. Jacks, and get a leg-up on a promotion? Christine fatefully chooses the latter, shaming Mrs. Ganush and dispossessing her of her home. In retaliation, the old woman places the powerful curse of the Lamia on Christine, transforming her life into a living hell. Haunted by an evil spirit and misunderstood by a skeptical boyfriend, she seeks the aid of seer Rham Jas to save her soul from eternal damnation. To help the shattered Christine return her life to normal, the psychic sets her on a frantic course to reverse the spell. As evil forces close in, Christine must face the unthinkable: How far will she go to break free of the curse?

The cast led by Alison Lohman (as Christine) & Justin Long (as Clay) is great! The directing by Sam Raimi (who also produced and co-wrote the screenplay with brother Ivan) (who also directed the ""Spider-Man"" (2002, 2004, & 2007, brother Ivan co-wrote the screen story and screenplay) movies & ""The Evil Dead"" trilogy (also wrote the stories and screenplays) (1981, also executive producer on the first one, 1987, & 1992, brother Ivan co-wrote the story and screenplay), he also directed ""Darkman"" (1990, also wrote the story and screenplay, brother Ivan also co-wrote the screenplay), ""The Gift"" (2000), & ""A Simple Plan"" (1998), he also produced ""30 Days Of Night"" (2007), ""The Grudge"" & its sequel (2004 & 2006), he also produced the upcoming ""Armored"" (2009) & is also rumored to be directing ""Spider-Man 4"" (2011, also executive producing) & ""The Evil Dead"" (2010, also writing the story and producing) is excellent! The story and screenplay by the Raimis is excellent!

The music by Christopher Young (who also did the music to ""The Gift"", ""The Grudge 1 & 2"" & ""Spider-Man 3"", he also did the music to ""the Uninvited"" (2009) is excellent! The cinematography by Peter Deming (who also did the cinematography to ""Evil Dead II"" & ""Scream 2 & 3"" (1997 & 2000) is excellent! The film editing by Bob Murawski (who also did the film editing to ""Army Of Darkness"" (Evil Dead 3), all 3 of the ""Spider-Man"" movies, even the upcoming 4th one, & ""The Gift"", was director of stock footage for ""Darkman"", he also did the film editing to the upcoming ""The Hurt Locker"" (2009) is excellent! The production design by Steve Saklad (who also did the production design to ""Juno"" (2007, which was directed by Jason Reitman) & ""Thank You For Smoking"" (2005, which was also directed by Reitman), he also did the art direction to ""Spider-Man 2"" & ""The Quick And The Dead"" (1995, which Sam Raimi also directed) is excellent! The art direction by James F. Truesdale (who also did the art direction to ""A Simple Plan"" & was an assistant art director on ""The Quick And The Dead"", he also did the art direction to the upcoming ""Funny People"" (2009) is excellent! The costume design by Isis Mussenden (who also did the costume design to ""Shrek 1 & 2"" (2001 & 2004), ""The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe"" (2005) & ""The Chronicles Of Narnia: Prince Caspian"" (2008), she is also doing the costume design to ""The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Voyage Of The Dawn Treader"" (2010) is excellent!

This is an excellent return to form to horror for Sam Raimi. This is right up there with the Evil Dead movies. This is also one of the best horror movies (even better-reviewed horror movie) in recent memory. This is also one of the best films of the year, so far, by far.",1369526400,,3794,4.685157421289356

3917261,3,B002EEOE34,"Drag me to Hell has plenty of campy moments, a few scary ones, some stylishly directed fun, but for the most part this film is 'run of the mill' material that can get very hokey at times. Still it really was often a fun movie to watch. What is sad though is that Raimi decided after decades to borrow some of the same sound, possesion, and makeup effects he used for moments in his early Evil Dead films- which even then were rather silly. The sceance scene in particularly was so 'Beyond the Door' It felt more like the silly film called 'Repossesed'(the slapstick comedy with Leslie Nielson and Linda Blair)than the electrifying horrorifying film I was expecting. Nowadays at least, Raimi knows how to make films that work despite the cheeseball moments. This one certainly feels pretty entertaining without seeming like a B-film or direct to DVD movie. Alison Lohman is hella cute and perfect for the lead role. Justin Long(Live free or Die hard) Plays the predictable boyfriend role, and he has little to nothing to knaw on in the script. His character is ultimately there as window dressing. This movie is a horror film that makes fun of Horror rather than taking it seriously. If you like horror with humorous bumps in the night rather than the serious terror films, you might love this movie. If you liked the silly comedy of Army of Darkness or Evil Dead II you might also like this. Personally I don't care at all for films like that. Especially if the adds, trailers and posters lead you to believe it's a serious horror film. Still this one was interesting enough to seem a little better than the usual horror movie, but all in all that is all it was. UPDATE: SAW IT AGAIN THE OTHER NIGHT AND AFTER ACCEPTING THE FILM ON IT'S OWN TERMS I REALLY DID ENJOY IT MORE AND FEEL IT COULD VERY WELL BECOME SOMETHING OF A CLASSIC.",1367971200,2,1832,4.537764350453172

Later on a beautiful blond woman who works for a bank meets an old gypsy woman who comes there to get an extension because the bank is going to forclose on her house. The bank officer speaks to her boss but he says no to a 3rd extension then all hell breaks loose. The bank officer ends up going to the same healer that worked on the young boy 40 years ago, and once more the healer meets and battles the same demon again

Cursing someone to die and go to hell in three days because you didn't get an extension on your loan, or someone stole your crappy necklace?

Drag Me To Hell is a genuinely scary movie. The film packs scare after scare after scare, from beginning to end. Also, it brilliantly blends in some comedy to keep the movie going and keep the audience on their feet; the nose bleed scene instantly comes to mind as a classic horror/comedy scene. (You may think it's safe to let your guard down, but it really isn't.) The story moves very fast because of how well the elements are blended together. The story is amazing, the pace is fast, the acting was great, and the music was fantastic. (The music stood out to me and had a real horror feel.) Also, the ending was amazing and actually surprised me. I'd just like to note, most of the scares are loud noise/loud music jump-out scares, you should know if your not a fan of this type of horror.

Overall, Drag Me To Hell is one of the best modern horror movies. I highly recommend this film to any horror fan, and movie fans in general.

This film has strong blood and violence, no sex or nudity.

Nasty gross-out groping gags, goofy gags that jar you ridiculously, and a fun predictability that we see so early on in the film that we can just watch everything unfurl to the promised ending. I can understand genre fans having mixed feelings on the film - but it isn't a 'horror' film really. It's a Sam Raimi horror film, and that's almost a genre in and of itself.

The BD has virtually no special features, but it does have a Production Diary, walking the viewers through some of the more memorable scenes and effects. But the film is so fun, the lack of bonus stuff doesn't sting so much.

3917311,1,B002EEOE34,"First, let me just say that I never cared for Sam Raimi. I'm more a Carpenter/Craven/Roth fan, not horror comedy. But even if I try to look at it from the perspective of Raimi fans, I can't imagine they would possibly be happy with the end-product here.

Really, it's just a totally lifeless premise that does nothing to save itself. First, the main antagonist is basically an undead gypsy and her Lamia friend. Nevermind that I know what a Lamia is, and it isn't in any way a goat, so why they decided to go with a goat to describe the Lamia, I'll never understand that. Historically, a Lamia's features are a lot more frightening than a freaking goat. Second, there isn't a single scary scene in the whole film, which relies essentially on the same thing Paranormal Activity did, albeit with a *LOT* more CG, and poorly-done CG, at that. I can't imagine anyone being scared of a room with everything blowing around and people screaming, or a toothless malicious gypsy, or food turning into maggots or whatever (yes, I know of the bulimia theory for the film and how often the title character is referred to as once being a fat kid and how much she hates it, hence the focus on food becoming evil).

It's hard to imagine an ending this unsatisfying. Everything comes down to this stupid little mistake the protagonist makes, and nothing more. It's nothing epic or worthy or even significant to the character. It's just there as a random act that could happen to literally anyone out of nothing but stupidity.

Basically, nothing here works. Our main character has no personality, the ""antagonists"" are so stupid as to not even be funny in this context, the whole film resides on disgusting the audience with constant images of maggots and toothless gypsies and other things of the sort, mixed in with ""screamer"" scares, rather than, you know, demons, or whatever.

I can't believe anyone would find this enjoyable, especially with the really, really distracting CG work whenever something goes wrong. It's so obviously CG and incredibly unrealistic-looking, and nothing in the entire film is frightening. Worse, the protagonist is just plain boring and stupid, so you can neither root for the villain nor the hero (at least Craven made Freddy Krueger someone you *wanted* to win at the end of every film because he somehow made killing funny, and in his other movies the villains were so unbelievably and viciously malevolent and soulless that you were glad when the protagonist won, and Carpenter had a knack for creating believable protagonists and very creative villainous things that didn't follow typical horror-film norms).

I recommend skipping this unless you enjoy bad horror films. (That's not sarcasm, I know some people like that type of genre just for laughs.) There are no scares, no characters for which we could feel any sympathy, a totally stupid villain, *WAY* overdone CG work, and nothing to make up for any of it.

If you want something that has some thought behind it, or really, anything scary or shocking, just skip this. There's a whole other league of horror films with far better writing, acting, and creativity.",1341360000,4,3140,4.848880597014926

3917317,5,B002EEOE34,"Sam Raimi delivers a modern-style horror with a real budget in Drag Me to Hell.  Now, I understand that a lot of people just plain HATED this movie.  They complained that it's not scary, it's loud, and the ending was soooo predictable.  I beg your pardon, but this is intended as a ""fun"" horror.  So if you laughed during the movie, you hold your tongue!  When on Earth has a fun horror been anything but these things?  I found it delightful and timeless.  Drag Me to Hell is a perfect horror movie. In case you thought I stuttered there, it is a ""perfect horror movie."" Here's what worked for me...

Drag Me to Hell is a morality tale, much as those of The Twilight Zone or Tales from the Crypt, about Christine Brown, a young woman who looking to ascend a bank's corporate ladder. To prove she can make ""tough calls"" to her boss she refuses a loan extension to a venerable gypsy of dubious finances (amazingly played, too). If horror has taught us anything it's that you never screw with gypsies or carnie folk--just look at what happened in Thinner. In proper gypsy form the hag issues the Curse of Lamia, a 3-day hex culminating in being dragged to Hell. This plot kept my interest even during the normally slow backstory build-up phase. How? The slow parts are not actually slow. There's are well-written office dramedies between the Christine and her office adversary (Stu, played by Reggie Lee of TV's Grimm) and her future mother-in-law. Much like The Last Exorcism (2010) or Grave Encounters (2011), one might even be satisfied with the movie had there been no actual attempt at HORROR at all!  A testament to good screenwriting.

Christine is played to perfection by Alison Lohman.  She's cute, peppy, credible, and has a serious gift for physical comedy. She's at the center of all of the horror, which I found to come at the perfect frequency and, even with cheap tactics (sudden loud sound and camera angle changes), highly effective at making me jump.  Raimi loves to put his actors through the ringer and Lohman comes off as a Fear Factor winner as she gets maggots, mud, blood, drool, and other fluids deluging her face. That's the gastro-intestinal beauty of it all; every jumpy-scare is readily ensued by some unspeakably disgusting gag that makes you cringe and smile. Movies like this are most effective when watched with friends (and beer).

The remaining cast--her love interest played by Justin Long (Going the Distance, AfterLife), Dileep Rao (Inception, Avatar), and David Paymer (Payback)--are just there to watch Lohman decompose throughout the movie.  But they all serve Raimi well as he shows his Evil Dead roots--even duplicating them--in later scenes in the best possible taste, including a malevolent goat possession which smacks of the cackling mounted deer head in Evil Dead 2.  Other highlights include floating Raimi-demons, some sacrifices, and numerous other sequences which I wouldn't dare ruin.

If you are seeing this for the first time, see it on a 60"" in pitch black at night with all of the lights off (even that dim light over the stove that we all leave on during movies to find our way to the fridge safely).  The more immersed you are, the higher you'll jump and the more you'll laugh.  Walk in expecting a fun-filled gross-out jumpfest and you'll leave very happy.",1332374400,,3313,4.792618629173989

3917324,2,B002EEOE34,"Sam Raimi's career has been mainly downs, in terms of box office takings at least. His only highs have been the Spider-Man movies (which I hated) while some of his better work (Darkman, The Quick and the Dead) only managed to gain a cult following. He emerged in the 80s as a surrealist horror director but over the years he's lost whatever edge he had and Drag Me To Hell is proof of that.

The oh-so-cute Alison Lohman (who I would drag to bed) plays a timid bank clerk who offends a decrepit Gypsy woman (a pastiche of former Raimi monsters) and is promptly cursed. In three days the not-scary-sounding demon The Lamia will drag her to hell, but not before having fun frightening her first.

The majority of the scares in the film are, I am sorry to say, overly telegraphed Stingers. Is this what Raimi is reduced to? The PG-13 rating means that this obviously isn't going to be hardcore, but it feels like it was written by a 15-year-old boy and directed by someone referencing the Big Book of Horror Cliches whenever they got stuck. The young Sam Raimi would have been appalled. When limited by the narrow parameters of being a PG-13 Raimi resorts to gross-out moments, mainly involving puking corpses, fake CGI blood, old woman saliva, more unconvincing CGI, and more old woman saliva. This is bottom-of-the-barrel stuff. It's like Spielberg selling Bruce the Shark on having bad breath.

Justin Long provides some decent support, though this film really does belong to Lohman. Her large brown eyes, innocent expressions, and naive demeanor make for a sympathetic character. I just wish she used more logic and common sense. There is a nice twist-in-the-tale which turns it into a Tales From the Crypt-style morality play, but other than that this is pure pot-boiling, pedestrian, Hollywood twaddle with NONE of the grit, rawness or edge of Evil Dead or Within the Woods.

The Blu Ray looks good in 2.40:1 1080p with DTS HD-MA sound and plenty of extras.",1326672000,2,1960,4.7558823529411764

Christine is a very likeable, main character who just wants to be valued for her hard work when things turn terribly wrong when she denies an old woman an extension on her house payment.

The exorcism scene where the cat Christine sacrificed comes out of the mediums mouth was another moment of comedy.

3917328,5,B002EEOE34,"""Drag Me to Hell"" is a classic scary movie, equal to but different from ""The Exorcist"", ""Psycho"", ""Night of the Living Dead"", ""Halloween"", and ""Jaws"". It's a roller coaster ride of startling and intense moments that had me jumping out of my chair and my friend covering his eyes, like we were ten years old again. The movie is scary because it's so well made. It does not resort to horrific extremes of blood and gore. I am not normally a fan of horror movies such as ""Saw"", but I love a good scary movie. Although ""Drag Me to Hell"" is not gory, it does have very gross moments. It has been released to theaters as PG-13, but it is extreme enough that it could easily be too much for some sensitive adults and teenagers. Director Sam Raimi became established from his low budget independent horror series ""The Evil Dead"", ""Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn"", and ""Army of Darkness"". He returns to horror, after making the first three ""Spider-man"" movies, with ""Drag Me to Hell"", and it's similar to ""The Evil Dead"" and ""Evil Dead 2"". It has the fun but not the campiness of ""Evil Dead 2"" (Bruce Campbell is not in ""Drag"").

3917329,4,B002EEOE34,"Sam Raimi returns to his roots with a campy, boisterous, and downright exhilarating horror that oozes campy vintage.  Raimi and his crew are master weavers of presentations that unnerve the senses (I'd like to thank the composer, editor, and sound mixer, in particular).  The end result is a dense, bold, and uncompromising film that slays sacred cows of cinema like they were...kittens.

You've been warned.

It's easy to overlook the performances, but both Lohman and Long are in absolute top form here; their darling chemistry is just earnest enough to deter the ever-present cheesiness from overstaying it's welcome...which does occur, unfortunately.

That said, it's an excess easily forgiven in the presence of a film that truly does rejuvenate a sense of innocent theater fun that is almost seen as taboo in a genre laden with mindless torture porn.

Raimi clearly feels the same, and revels in pressing our traditional buttons with childlike glee.  Is it wrong?  Not when it feels so, so right.  ""Drag Me to Hell"" is certainly a film that will appeal to only some - or, perhaps, even few - but, in the end, maybe that's just what the master of the Evil Dead wants.",1324166400,,1172,4.878787878787879

3917332,5,B002EEOE34,"I will start this review off with one simple fact: I love Sam Raimi. I remember staying up late at night as a child watching the original ""Evil Dead"" through the corners of my fingers. It scared the hell out of me but, at the same time, there was something genuinely gratuitously amazing about the film. It was bold, bloody, filled with puss and maggots, and gore. It was incredible. If the nine year old me at the time could have married anything, it would have been The Evil Dead.

After the Evil Dead trilogy, Raimi pretty much stayed away from horror (not including the excellent and sorely underrated ""The Gift""). That is until 2009 when Raimi splashed his way back into the scene with ""Drag Me to Hell."" I'll be the first to admit that I had no desire to see ""Drag Me to Hell."" PG-13? Yawn. Ancient spirits? Double yawn. Justin Long? I think I'm falling asleep already. Little did I know what I had coming.

The plot is relatively simple. Determined to impress her boss and get a much-needed promotion at work, Christine Brown lays down the law when mysterious Mrs. Ganush literally comes begging for mercy at her feet. In retaliation for being publicly shamed, Mrs. Ganush places the dreaded curse of the Lamia on her unfortunate target, transforming Christine's life into a waking nightmare. Her skeptical boyfriend, Clay, casually brushing off her disturbing encounters as mere coincidence, Christine attempts to escape eternal damnation by seeking out the aid of seer Rham Jas. But Christine's time is fast running out, and unless she's able to break the curse, she'll be tormented by a demon for three days before literally being dragged to hell.

What follows is gore, gore, and more gore. How this film was granted a PG-13 I'll never know. A waterfall of a nosebleed, gooey dentures, dancing goats, maggots...if you can imagine it, it's here. The film works as a social satire (the death of the middle and lower classes) and as a horror/comedy (the ritual at the end has to be seen to be believed). The performances are top natch and the ending is quite ballsy in its conviction (you'll see it coming a mile away but will be surprised they actually follow through on it). Overall though, if you love movies like ""The Evil Dead"", ""Army of Darkness"", or ""Cabin Fever"", it's a must watch. It is one of the best horror films of 2009.",1322697600,,2342,4.6658595641646485

3917334,4,B002EEOE34,"I'm a huge Sam Raimi fan, but this isn't his best work. I'm not saying it isn't good, just something was missing to make it outstanding. The writing felt a bit disjointed in parts throughout. A very good story premise and some great Hitchcockian like scenes, but lacking some of the scare and fun of previous Raimi movies. The actors and actresses didn't bring any special chemistry to it and I think with a better casting this would have improved the movie greatly. Bruce Campbell would have helped this movie in any role with his offbeat humor and unlike many of Raimi other works, he isn't here.

A young female bank loan officer inadvertently maddens an old gypsy that puts a curse on her. At first the young woman is just frightened by supernatural events, but eventually she'll try anything to save her soul from being dragged to hell. When she tries to make amends to the old woman she finds she has died so she must enlist any occult practitioner to remove the curse.

A good excuse to cuddle up on the bed under the covers.  The beginning of the movie was awesome.  Scary.  Really good.  It had a great story, and the old gypsy lady was very well done.  I was glued to the TV.  But I must say, as the movie went on, it got worse.  About half way, it took a turn for the worse and started a downward spiral.  It started to get ridiculously stupid.  By the end of the movie, I had lost all interest.  I found myself getting up, wandering around, getting sodas and talking, mostly about how stupid the movie had gotten.  It was really bad.  Great beginning, not so great middle, and a crappy stupid ending.

I mean it's like one jump scare after another with little-to-no quiet moments. The leads are bland and the rest are forgettable. The villian is 1D at best. The ending is phoned in a mile away. The only A+ in this film that it does try to scare you and it does have scary images,unlike Exorcist 2. Overall,it's nothing more then a Evil Dead wannabe that fails to be funny. I give this film a 1 out of 10.",1320019200,3,517,4.18
3917338,4,B002EEOE34,"The story - directly borrowed from the film ""Night of the Demon"" .  A ""transferable curse"" in the form of an innocuous object is given to someone.  The suspense is in the very limited amount of time one has to lift the curse or return it back to its original owner.  Otherwise, what happens?  Well, the audience knows that a very unfriendly demon from hell will make that someone's acquaintance very soon in a really bad way.

The scare techniques are via The Exorcist and the un-gross-out FX humor is via the three stooges.  The overall feel is of being on the Disney ""Haunted Mansion"" Ride.

All the acting is very good and the characters likable.  The extraordinarily good sported actress, Alison Lohman, pretty much carries the film, she does a great job.  She had to have a very good sense of humor.  I can see her saying to the director -  ""you want me to do WHAT?""

There is a very good atmospheric soundtrack along with beautiful Hollywood-ish style photography and clever editing.  There are imaginative but not overused CGI effects that are mostly just to elicit laughs and do the trick fright well.  The Goat was my personal favorite.

What we end up with is ninety minutes of campy, old haunted house style, thrills, chills, shocks and laughs.

I for one enjoyed the heck out of this film.

I do not understand why the many one and two star reviews for the film other than that they are coming from a very jaded group of reviewers who are still stuck in the mud, hoping for another Bruce Campble style Evil Dead film.

Drag Me To Hell is a real good fun horror that delivers the goods and has a especially nice dark twisty ending that even I didn't see coming.

If you lighten up a bit, relax, and as long as you enjoy a side dish of CGI slapstick with your suspense then you will most likely enjoy Drag Me to Hell a whole lot.

On a side note - the resemblance of DMTH to Night of the Demon is rather obvious, right up to the grand finale taking place at a train station.  That said - I think Mr Raimi like Mr. Tarantino knows and respects a good cult film when he sees one and in this case I think DMTH shows respect for films like Night of the Demon and is not a rip off.  I for one am glad for directors like Mr. Raimi and Mr. Tarantino who coninually demonstrate they've watched and appreciated and studied some truely great underated films.",1319846400,,2358,4.360091743119266

""Drag Me to Hell,"" is the last horror film directed by Sam Raimi, (""Evil Dead) in 2009. Every horror fan was salivating from their toothy fangs to bite into this one, as was I. The movie got great reviews, many literally saying he was back to form, & expounded on many ""Evil Dead"" similarities with this film. Was all the hoopla right?

Oh yeah! ""Drag Me to Hell"" was a masterful mix of straight out horror, dread, suspense, & comedy, ala', ""Evil Dead!"" & ""Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn"" It has Sam Raimi's directional stamp all over it, but it's not a remake or close to a remake of the those films, though some would have you think that. But, I am convinced it is a remake, or at the very least, heavily influenced by the best horror film of the 50's, English movie, ""The Night of the Demon,"" or as called in America, ""Curse of the Demon."" A true masterpiece of horror if there has ever been one! There are so many elements in ""Drag Me to Hell,"" that are right out of ""Night of the Demon,"" that there is no way that it's coincidence. Those including the passing of a curse through an object from the person who cursed it, because of the protagonist offensive actions. In ""Night of the Demon"" it was a parchment, in ""Drag Me to Hell"" it was a button, both could be passed on to someone else, & thusly the curse passed on to someone else. Also, there are several scenes with a flying handkerchief in ""Drag Me to Hell,"" so reminiscent of the flying parchment of ""Night of the Demon,"" when the parchment would try to fly away from the person who holds it, sealing their doom. There was the encroaching Demon in both movies, at first the victims thought it was a coincidence, or a fluke, then they started to question their sanity, & finally come to the realization that it is all real! In ""Night of the Demon"" the protagonist was a psychiatrist. In ""Drag Me to Hell"" the victims boy friend was a psychiatrist, both did not believe in the supernatural, with disdain, both try to discredit it. Both finding out it was real. Both films had a Indian (India) Seer, who both psychiatrists disagree with at the start. ""Drag Me to Hell"" even borrowed certain key snippets of soundtrack from ""Curse of the Demon."" Both victims went back to the house of the person who cursed them, looking for away to end it. Both films involved clannish believers. Both victims tried to pass on the cursed object to the one that cursed them, & if this was all not enough to make you believe this film was a remake, the train station scene in the end clinches it! Oh, there is no doubt that a young Sam Raimi watched ""Night of the Demon,"" & was in awe of it, as he very well should've of been! I believe this film is his tribute to it.

""Drag Me to Hell"" is a fast moving, great looking (blu-ray) & sounding film! Anyone who call their selves a horror fan should see this film if you've not, & if you have, see it again, & don't forget to check out one of the greatest horror films of all time, ""Night of the Demon!""",1317686400,,3018,4.300527240773286

3917346,4,B002EEOE34,"Drag Me to Hell marked the return of Sam Raimi to directing a horror film as well as being the co-writer with his brother Ivan Raimi. While distracted with the Spiderman franchise as of late Sam's initial claim to fame was a small series a few of you may have heard of - Evil Dead. Yes the pivotal movies that launched both his career and that of B-Star legend Bruce Campbell has returned back to his roots in a movie that clearly pays homage to what made him famous as well as adding in a few new tricks.

The most noticeable difference between this and any of Sam's Evil Dead movies is that this one has a budget. The fact that the main noticeable difference is an increased budget is good because he doesn't sacrifice the fun thrills from his earlier movies or the humor that is subtly found within. I would say the introduction scene sets the tone to the movie perfectly - a young boy who has been cursed tries to outrun that which has cursed him and ends up being thrown from a balcony into a pit that has opened full of flames and is surely a gateway to hell (hence the movie title.) If you are going to go off killing children in the very first scene of a movie you know it's going to be a fun ride!

We are introduced quickly to Christine (Alison Lohman) who is a young woman that is inches away from getting an assistant manager's job that she has long wanted at the bank she works for. However the job is not set in stone and she has competition in the form of a weasel named Stu (only being mentioned because of that great first name.) In order to secure the position she has been told to be a bit stricter on loans and soon is asked to extend the payment date on an old woman's mortgage. This old woman though is a sickly looking elderly gypsy lady, Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver.) When she tells the old woman no, Mrs. Ganush will not take it as an answer and turns to begging. When further denied she is petrified at what she has had to do and still be denied. This of course is not the end of it.

When in her car and ready to go home that night Christine is attacked by the old gypsy in a fight scene that screams back to early scenes filmed by Raini and you cannot tear your eyes away for a moment. As the fight comes to a close the old lady loses but puts a curse on Christine. This curse quickly proves to us who has really won the fight as there is no end to the constant harassment Christine suffers in both her professional and personal life.

Raini has returned to horror in true style and just the way it was meant to be. Every scene keeps you wanting to know what is going to happen and the way it was filmed puts you in a perfect frame of mind for a fun horror film. It's not surprising that a Raini horror movie has humor In it but it is surprising at how many laughs are found in this one while still being able to pull off having it be suspenseful.",1301875200,2,2872,4.123214285714286
3917347,4,B002EEOE34,"""Drag Me to Hell"" is a unique dark comedy with gross-outs, pop-outs, and dark humor. It's from Sam Raimi (director of the Evil Dead films), so you know you're going to get something a bit more weird than the regular horror movie. The whole film has a very light vibe to it, just like a comedy movie, so when the scares come in, it isn't really scary, it's just creepy. It has this weird storyline to it, but the whole film is supposed to be weird, so I guess it doesn't really matter. It has a couple creepy sequences with a few grossouts (projectile nose bleeds, bugs coming out of someone's mouth, etc.), but it works with those scenes well. This film also feels like it's trying to give an old-school horror feel, which it kind of works.
  As the film climaxes, you're going to get more scenes where it mixes funny with creepy and altogether doesn't form anything scary, but it forms entertainment. That's whats unique about ""Drag Me to Hell"". During the ending, I guess it gets pretty exciting, but the ending...it's kinda screwed up. Altogether, if you love old-school b-movies, then I suggest you see ""Drag Me to Hell"", you'll most likely love it.",1301529600,,1153,4.565217391304348

The real problem lies with the lead...Alison Lohman, she is dreadful.  You have absolutely no connection with her character. She is just going through the motions.  No development, no empathy, no sympathy, no hatred, no nothing.  She is one-dimensional and that is the real disaster of this movie.

3917355,5,B002EEOE34,"I'm not a fan of most modern horror films, so I found the title ""Drag Me To Hell"" a little off-putting as it conjured up images of a film I'd rather not watch, but based on positive reviews online I gave it a chance and so should you!  ""Drag Me To Hell"" isn't your typical brain-dead Hollywood slasher film, but a thoughtfully written suspenseful film with great acting by Alison Lohman, Justin Long, and Lorna Raver.  The premise is almost like something out of a classic Hollywood horror film from the 1930s.  Christine Brown, a loan officer (played by Lohman), makes a decision to foreclose on an old woman's home, invoking her wrath and a curse.  The old woman, Sylvia Ganush (played with panache by Raver), is no sweet old grandmother, but instead is possessed of supernatural powers.  It's never made clear if she's a gypsy or from whence her powers derive, but clearly she wants revenge on Christine and places a curse on her.  But this is no mere passive curse that follows Christine as Mrs. Ganush's spirit actively stalks, taunts, and attacks Christine.  Yet no one can seemingly believe that the elderly Mrs. Ganush is capable of doing this, even Christine's boyfriend Clay Dalton (played by Long).  The taunts and attacks from Mrs. Ganush on Christine mount, adding to the tension as Christine tries increasingly unorthodox methods to break the spell and rid herself of Mrs. Ganush.  The climax of the movie is a series of genuinely ""I didn't see that coming"" moments that will shock you.  The finale is as unsettling as it is unexpected, leaving the viewer stunned - the hallmark of a great suspenseful movie.  Some viewers may be displeased with the ending and the gross out effects throughout the movie, although those moments add greatly to the overall tension of the film.  By the end ""Drag Me to Hell"" is the kind of suspense/horror movie I want to see - driven more by interpersonal relations gone wrong, missed opportunities, and bad choices than by indiscriminate chainsaw wielding maniacs, brainless lumbering zombies, or glittery disco vampires.  ""Drag Me To Hell"" is almost akin to Edgar Allen Poe as it plumbs the darker impulses of human nature, albeit with supernature and the occult added to the mix.

The film is loaded with old age stereotypes, snobby yuppies.  I urge everyone to watch a classic Hammer film or something with genuine style - not this potboiler!",1290988800,3,450,4.792207792207792
3917357,1,B002EEOE34,"I saw this movie today. I watch the show Dexter and Supernatural, grew up on games like Mortal Kombat, I have read the Satanic Bible by Anton Lavey as well as other Satanist literature. I even flirted once with the idea of joining the Church of Satan (I opted not to however do to major philosophical disagreements with Anton Lavey, I do not support the views of Ayn Rand, Ragner Redbeard or social darwinism while Anton Lavey does).

This movie went way to far in my opinion. I really was disgusted with the fact that children and kittens were murdered (I currently grieving the loss a dog who died last September and was very dear to me which made the pet being killed even more upsetting).

A documentary about child or animal abuse at least has educational merit. However this movie was designed to be entertaining. I'm sorry but it is not (at least not to me).

There have been some reviews I have read that say that this movie is supposed to be hilarious. Excuse me? A women murdered her cat and a child was killed. I think one would need to be sadistic and downright sociopathic to find that kind of stuff funny.

I read a review of this movie that said that justice was served. Really? The main character felt badly about her actions and tried to make it right and to make up for her mistake. She also was overall a reasonably decent person. So I think eternal damnation was seriously overdoing it.

As far as the kid. He tried to give what he took back and I think that ought to count for something. At most the kid should get a time out or something. I think sending children to hell under any circumstances is pretty unjust.

Even the Church of Satan has problems with killing animals and children. However, they may not have the same views as I about films like this.

I have an English tutor who once said that art reflects the soul. If that is true than the director of this film is truly disturbed indeed and probably a truly sadistic individual.",1290384000,,1961,4.415512465373961

this blu ray came with the digital copy which I have on my ipod and if you buy it now the digital copy will do you no good as it expired after Oct. 31, 2010.

I don't see digital downloading being the future and killing off the disc format because hard drives can crash and then your collection is gone. even if you can back it up on dvd-r's those can stop reading over time and any die hard collector such as myself will always love to go into a store and browse for new titles to buy. you can't browse for downloads, at least you can't where i live, lol.",1289433600,,1159,3.9742489270386265

Accordingly we have DRAG ME TO HELL, a series of slapstick gimmicks that had me in stitches from start to finish.  This stuff is the Three Stooges with a barrel of Nickelodeon slime.

Predictably we have the ridiculous premise of a marmish loan officer (Alison Lohman) reluctantly turning down a revolting gypsy woman who is seeking an extension on her loan.  A demonic curse is unleashed--the object of which is a button, for cryin' out loud--and the fun begins, from an hysterical struggle in a sedan to a mud bath in the graveyard that was pure comedic gold.  In between we have enough gross-out scenes and material (let's just say Lohman has a lot of stuff hurled in her mouth and face) to realize DRAG ME TO HELL is director Sam Raimi's tongue-in-cheek spoof to overdone horror flicks.  And just as predictably, evil triumphs, while Justin Long (playing the doubting boyfriend) looks unapologetically bored.  And he should be; he doesn't get in on any of the fun.

The special effects are good, and scary, but not as extreme as Evil Dead. Of course the characters are cardboard and the plot thin, but this is a popcorn movie and it does what it is supposed to do very well.

Yes, the overall plot has been done to death [pardon the pun], with a beautiful young person exposed to a deadly curse.  Yes, the special effects are unbelievable, ridiculous and disgusting, but still the film held my attention.

A lovely young woman has been cursed for not extending a loan to the WRONG person.  I think the moral of the story is that if you should happen to be a loan officer, never-ever turn down a loan to a disgusting-looking gypsy woman.  It's a mistake that can lead to bodily attacks, slime in the mouth and an incurable curse.

Our cursed heroine goes through it all--knock down brawls with an ancient gypsy woman; mouthfuls of embalming fluid; nocturnal attacks by demons; a humiliating dinner with potential parents-in-laws; animal sacrifice; demonic seance and much, much, much more.  It's quite a trip but, like I said, it held my attention.  I must have been in just the right mood but I might think otherwise when I try to go to sleep tonight.",1282176000,3,1048,4.627027027027027
3917367,5,B002EEOE34,"Other than seeing bits of Evil Dead 2 on tv years ago, I was unfamiliar with Sam Raimi's work. The trailer for Drag Me To Hell piqued my interest although in the back of my mind I thought it might turn out like every other forgettable horror flicks these days, recycling the same story over and over. I'm pleased to say that this film isn't like that.

Alison Lohman (whom you might remember from White Oleander and Matchstick Men) stars as Christine Brown, an insecure, mild mannered L.A. loan officer competing with a co-worker for a promotion. An elderly woman named Mrs. Sylvia Ganush (Lorna Raver) asks for a third extension on her mortgage payment and although Christine wants to help her out, she remembers a lecture from her boss about having to make tougher decisions if she wants to become the assistant manager. She refuses the extension even though Mrs. Ganush pleads for mercy on her hands and knees. Poor Christine discovers that payback is a- well, you know, when the old woman puts a curse on her. The poor thing has 3 days in which an ancient demonic spirit called the Lamia torments her before dragging her to hell. Fun, right? While doing her best to fight off the violent demon, Christine tries to undo the curse and save her soul from eternal damnation with the help of medium Rham Jas (Dileep Rao). Justin Long is excellent as Christine's boyfriend Clay. He's skeptical about the curse, but does everything he can to ease his girlfriend's fears.

The premise sound like a downer? It's not at all. While it's obviously based in horror, the movie has plenty of intentionally comedic moments. Trust me, you'll laugh more than you scream and it's a good thing. There's a possessed profane goat for crying out loud. Who doesn't love that? Best of all, the Lamia is one bad mutha. The first scenes prove that the demon spares no one. If you've got a curse on you, you'd better do all you can to save yourself. A soul is just plain dinner to that thing.

A female loan officer ( Christine Brown ) at a bank is cursed by a disposessed old gypsy woman when the loan officer refuses an extention on her mortgage.  What ensues is a desperate race against time as Christine tries to stop the course of the gypsy's curse. She has three days to try to stop it, before she is ""dragged to hell"" for eternity.  She is attacked viciously by a shadowy demonic figure, and suffers some very nasty afflictions, including facing horrible ghostly transfigurations of the gypsy woman. The acting is surprisingly excellent and you are drawn into the nightmare by the believable terror created by the actors.  This will keep you on the edge of your seat. It also has an appropriately horrific ending..., though some people may wish the ending was different..., it fits well with the overall theme of the movie.

But this movie was just silly, and stupid.  The main character is so dumb that she is dumb beyone the normal stereotype of the female lead in a horror movie.  If her acting wasn't bad enough, the stupid gags are even worse.  For me the worst part was when we basically got a Looney Tunes gag thrown into the movie in the form of an anvil being suspended with a rope and pulley system and then dropped on the old gypsy lady's head.  If that wasn't bad enough, then her eyes pop out of her head in the same cartoony effect that Wiley Coyote's do whenever a boulder/anvil drops on him in a Road Runner cartoon.

This movie was not scary, and the writer relied too much on jump scares, which by the way I was able to call out every single one of them before they happened, and he also relied too much on vomit humor.  Frankly he seemed to be more determined to gross his audience out rather than scare them.

This movie could be a scary movie if seen from the perspective of the lead female actress, hot blonde Alison. Good special effects. Lesson to learn: learn to have compassion on others who need a roof over their heads! OK. The old lady was hasty too, her fault is the greatest because she should have realized that it is the bank manager's (Mr Jim Jack's) fault that the loan was rejected, the loan officer (Ms Brown) was only a button woman trying to act tough at the wrong time. Go blame the bank and shut the bank down, don't take it out on the loan officer. Besides, what is the large extended family of that old woman for? They come together to PARTY at the old woman's death while they didn't bother to take care of her when she was alive? The old woman didn't notice that? Odd! Why pin the blame on one person alone? Didn't she know that even if Ms Brown were to approve an extension of the loan out of compassion, her bank manager (Mr Jim Jacks) has the final say and can veto any approval so that he and the bank can take the equity of the house for themselves? The old woman could have asked for refinancing, approached other banks, rented out rooms in her house for rental income, etc. Her grand-daughter didn't give her advice? The old woman rightly called herself a ""proud woman"", and she alone shamed herself in the middle of the bank, why take it out on one front-desk person when it was the bank's fault?

The afflicted victim casually mentions ""Christ"" and ""God"" once but never resorts to calling upon their names for help! How strange! It doesn't occur to her that only an appeal to the highest court of order can save her? Perhaps this is how atheists living in an unbelieving non-Christian country (aka modern day USA) deals with such events in life - first go to a fortune teller and then pay $10,000 to a medium to banish evil.

Here are some good banishing calling cards for you:

Oh, don't forget the Holy Water and go file a formal request at your Catholic Church for a formal exorcism.

Did you notice that the female medium tried to summon and banish the haunting entity from and during a seance! Goodness, how amateurish! They approached the summoning area without any lasting cleansing or purification rituals in a dirty, run down place that's bound to attract only negatives. Bad choice for everyone involved. Even if they didn't have any Christian beliefs, at the very least, do a proper job for the afflicted client! Holding hands round a table won't do anyone any good. What sloppy work, and they wonder how and why everything went awry! The script-writers of this movie could have better spent a few more hours doing research for the seance scene, or scrap the seance altogether and move straight ahead into a proper banishing rite that resembles reality. This is not a Harry Potter movie, is it?

Well, it's not groundbreaking, but it's a finely told story:  Sam Raimi is just a master at visual storytelling.  Everything perfectly clear, nothing is ever lingered on for too long or passed over too quickly.  The acting, also, was impressive for this sort of thing.  Finally, the script is tight, coherent, and character-driven.  All in all, I don't think I've ever seen a horror film brought off better.

From a old woman gumming our heroine's arm to socially-awkward mega-nosebleeds, there are some amazing funny bits in here.  Don't forget the little homages to ""Evil Dead II,"" either; the appearance of Ash's car and a few other little details will please most viewers.  On top of that, our heroine is sympathetic without being saccharine, and the script is tightly written.  This is a hundred minute express train that tells a story and races for the curtain.  Those expecting unrelenting grimness and extreme Saw-type gore will be disappointed.  But almost everyone else, even folks who don't typically like horror movies, should enjoy this.  Highly recommended.",1276214400,,993,5.19496855345912
3917375,4,B002EEOE34,"Sam Raimi returns to the horror genre which started his career many years ago with Evil Dead and shows he's lost none of his ability to terrify, gross-out, and make viewers laugh hysterically.  Alison Lohman is Christine Brown, a bank loan officer who is vying with another employee for the assistant manager position.  In an effort to show her boss she can make the tough decisions, she declines an old lady's request for more time to make her mortgage payment.  Big mistake!  The old gypsy had attacks Christine with hellish fury in the parking garage and puts a curse on her.  An evil spirit called a Lamia will come to claim her soul in three days unless she can find a way to dissuade the creature.  Along for the ride is Christine's boyfriend Clay (Justin Long) and a psychic Rham Jas (Dileep Rao) who tries to help Christine rid herself of the curse.

Our psychotic hag gypsy, Mrs. Ganush, seems ripped from an old Universal Pictures horror film and then amped up steroids to give viewers one grotesquely revolting old lady and her harrowing confrontation with Christine in the parking garage is one of the highlights of the film.  She spews concoctions of worms, maggots, and a noxious liquid at the drop of a hat!  It's like watching no-holds barred WWE wrestling match.  These are typical Raimi demons, wicked yet with an unerring sense of over-the-top slapstick that elicits both screams of terror and howls of laughter.

Alison Lohman does a marvelous job of channeling Bruce Campbell's ""Ash"" from the Evil Dead films deftly becoming the terrorized victim, and yet valiant hero as she wages her personal war with the Lamia.  She also shows Campbell 's ability for physical comedy when she duels with a haunted scarf that refuses to be pulled from her face.  Justin Long, known more for sophomoric comedic roles, seems misplaced here as the supportive boyfriend.

Raimi shows off techniques that were not part of his repertoire thirty years ago with unique camera angles and perspectives.  With the slanted shots I could not help but think of Lovecraft and his penchant for strange geometry playing significant roles in many of his stories.

The script was written by Sam Raimi along with his brother Ivan and includes all manner of sight and sound gags including gleefully prancing demons, talking goats, ridiculous run-ins with corpses, and a classic horror film s&eacute;ance.

While not the ground-breaking film that Evil Dead was, Drag Me to Hell is a frenetic and enjoyable ride and a welcome return to horror for Sam Raimi.",1276128000,,2541,4.8584686774942
3917376,5,B002EEOE34,"Drag Me to Hell is actually a pretty good horror film.

Yes, it's incredibly cheesy (perhaps even cheesier than most if for no other reason the gore factor is almost laughably overbearing at times).

To give a good example of this, check out that scene with a dead body falling out of a casket and landing on top of a woman while green juice from the dead womans mouth splashes inside the mouth of the girl lying underneath of her... ew!)

Some of the special effects are truly unique though.  Again, they were borderline laughable, and by this point in time, seeing a body float in the air and sail around the room no longer has the same suspense that it originally had many years ago.  I almost let out a laugh during a few body-floating scenes, but held back.

Some of the acting skills felt subpar, especially from the main blonde-haired female character.  Her acting isn't that great in this film. Perhaps she's better at delivering lines in other films, I wouldn't know.  She is really cute though.

The best moments are whenever the curse that was put on the main character begins to act up.  Usually you'd see really freaky shadow demons, things being tossed around the room, highly unusual sounds, etc.  This shadow figure is called a lamia.  His hairstyle is apparently similar to a joker, going by the shadows we see of it on the walls.  The scariest moment in the entire film is when the lamia's arms stretch underneath a bedroom door and attempt to grab the woman.  That is one freaky scene.

I can't help it- horror films like these are just so enjoyable even though I feel a bit guilty for liking them.",1274572800,,1617,4.527586206896552

It seems as though an elderly woman (Lorna Raver) whom she denied a loan extension to has burdened her with a curse that gives her three miserable days before she is, well, dragged to Hell.

Without a doubt, Raimi is in full-form here, and in spite of its PG-13 rating, ""Drag Me To Hell"" is a hilariously outrageous and intense experience much in the vein of the ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Evil-Dead/dp/B00005R24K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Evil Dead</a>"" trilogy.

3917383,4,B002EEOE34,"Hollywood turns out so many crummy horror films, that when a good one comes along, it gets little attention. Worse, when it's a relatively restrained film (""relatively"" being a relative term) that's largely devoid of gore, and thus has a PG-13 (rather than R) rating, viewers (whose taste in such things has been badly distorted by ultra-violent films) give the kind of ""Duh. This ain't a very good film. Duh."" reviews that litter these pages.

Sam Raimi made his reputation with tongue-in-cheek horror, and ""Drag Me to Hell"" does not disappoint. Though the tone is dead-serious throughout, Raimi is able to insert laugh-out-loud humor -- and even wink at the audience -- without destroying the film's mood. This is a remarkable achievement, something few, if any (other) directors can do. (See my recent review of Stephen Sommers' incompetent ""The Mummy"".)

Another thing greatly helping ""Drag Me"" is that the story is a legitimate drama, with the characters behaving like real people who make believable decisions. It's Christine's desire to look good with her boss (to improve her chances at promotion) by denying a mortgage extension to Mrs Ganush that sets the story in motion. As Mrs Ganush has already been granted two extensions, and is decidedly repulsive, we sympathize with Christine's decision -- though it's the wrong one!

The story arc is identical to that of the classic British film ""Night of the Demon"" (""Curse of the Demon"" in its truncated US version): The principal character has been passed a cursed object that they have to pass to someone else, or they'll be devoured by demons.

""Drag Me to Hell"" isn't (in the absolute sense) a ""great"" film, but it's an excellent horror film, of the type that will someday achieve cult status. The Blu-ray transfer is beautiful, and you have your choice of the theatrical version, or the ""Director's Cut"", which is less than one minute longer, and presumably includes something that would have gotten the film an R. What it is, I don't know.

If you like clever, well-done horror flicks that /do not/ depend on revolting the audience with gore, you'll like ""Drag Me to Hell"".

PS: I neglected to mention Christopher Young's excellent score. He also did ""Spider-Man 3"", another fine score. Young has a big future in film scoring -- assuming producers and directors recognize great film music when they hear it. I doubt all do.",1272672000,6,2385,4.9351620947630925

3917385,4,B002EEOE34,"I just finished watching it in a dark room with a big screen TV and excellent sound.....freakin' terrifying! I cannot tell you how many times I curled into a ball covering my eyes or just screamed. My volume damaged the eardrums of another viewer in the room. I do admit to being a bit of a wimp when it comes to scary movies that deal with supernatural things but whoa.

Sam Raimi finally returns to horror after a long time making more mainstream movies like ""Spider-Man"". Wow, did he ever come back. This is what the man can do with a BUDGET after the Evil Dead movies. THOSE freaked me out and occasionally made me laugh. This did the same with higher quality CGI and effects. There is so much projectile blood and liquid going in and out of the mouth, I might be sick. I was impressed with what a good horror movie it was though! I was positive I had it all figured out at one point and there was a slight twist at the end different from what I thought would happen-- in a good way. I enjoyed how Raimi's story was like a living nightmare and still had moments that were SO over the top that you can breath easier because you have to laugh at the ridiculousness.

Alison Lohman plays a woman who denies a gypsy woman her THIRD extension on her loan on her house and gets cursed. It's an old story, but still pretty timely with the housing crisis so that makes me giggle. I have never seen any of Alison Lohman's previous movies and she did impress me with her sweet face and balls-y attitude when she needed to man up and defeat her demon (figuratively and literally). However, her character gets a big BOO from me for cruelty to animals. I can't forgive her as a kitty-parent of three cats. Justin Long plays her psychology professor boyfriend and plays the same nice guy character he usually is, but I was pleasantly surprised to see him trying to play a role I felt was built for someone who looks older so I guess he's stretching out his range. He didn't do too bad, but there wasn't much for him to do in this movie but react to his girlfriend's crazy story and hand her dough when she wants her fortune read.

A great date night movie, but might be so scary that the romance is GONE. I know I had to watch a 20 minute anime comedy immediately afterward to cleanse my mind so I don't have nightmares when I go to sleep tonight of nasty old lady dentures......or being gummed to death....I don't know what's worse.....eeew[...]",1269129600,2,2436,4.349450549450549
3917386,2,B002EEOE34,"Drag Me to Hell: 4 out of 10: Great another movie that achieved universal critical acclaim that I did not enjoy. Oh make matters worse it is a horror film (which almost never achieves universal acclaim and which I love) and is by director Sam Raimi whom I genuinely enjoy.

Drag me to Hell is all about gypsy curses. In the tradition of the superior Thinner and Buffy the Vampire Slayer our heroine Alison Lohman is a bank manager who turns down a third extension on an old gypsy's house mortgage causing her to lose the home.. (Lohman is eyeing a promotion and her boss told her to be tough) The Gypsy in question attacks Lohman (in the films best scene) and then places a curse on her. She has three days to get rid of the curse or she will literally be dragged to hell.

In those three days, the demon in question will torment Lohman, so far so good. Then the movie falls of the rails. Lohman does something so horrific and unnecessary to get rid of the curse she becomes a Black Hat extraordinaire. Now a twist like that certainly can work if the film acknowledges it, but Raimi keeps his cards too close to the vest.

It quickly comes apparent that Lohman, despite acting as a younger, blonder, more innocent Kirsten Dunst, is the most evil thing in the film. The film simply does not really pull this switcheroo off or may not even realize it on some level.

The main fault lies with the lead performance of Alison Lohman who seems to skip through the movie with one confused expression, another confused expression and a decent scream. Raimi knows his buttons too well and fixates on violating the chaste Loman's mouth with flies, maggots, blood, fists, entire arms, and in the most disgusting thing ever; an old ladies mouth without her dentures.

Loman cannot pull off a fun evil so instead she is more the brain-dead banal evil. This is a role that requires a Linda Ferrentino style touch. I simply do not think Loman had the chops for the role.

The films tone is strange as well. Many scenes are clearly tongue in cheek (a giant anvil held by a rope for instance) but others are so horrific (The aforementioned horrible act that shall not be named) that it takes one out of the story.

The rest of the cast is decent with Justin Long giving a particularly strong performance as the really nice guy with the evil girlfriend from hell. (Well going to hell... you know what I mean.) Long is best known as the Apple guy and the film keeps sticking him in front of Apple product placements handicapping his effectiveness.

There is also some strangely bad CGI in the mix. While Raimi really knows how to push the gross-out buttons and the jump scares, he would have been better off with some old school effects.

Overall I am beyond disappointed. Nevertheless, I guess once again I will be that guy who didn't like the film everyone else loved. It is 'Rushmore' all over again.",1268870400,,2884,4.499043977055449
3917387,5,B002EEOE34,"Sam Raimi goes back to his roots in this horror flick, which has been well executed, so to speak. There is no elaborate plot - Lorna Raver's Gypsy curses Alison Lohman (Loan Officer Christine Brown) after she refuses a loan extension. The curse (Lamia) is so powerful that Lohman would end up in hell in just three days. That is basically the story - the film portrays how Lohman struggles to fend off the Lamia.
The twist in this tale is fairly obvious to spot, but that does not take anything away from Raimi's story telling or the brilliance of some of the effects shots. The presence of a kitten early in the movie suggests that things would get uneasy and not many can bear the thought of anything happening to a kitten. Granted, some of the effects are over the top and almost comedic, but the horror element always prevails.
Raver deserves accolades for her truly bone-chilling performance. I wouldn't want be anywhere near her and I can only sympathise with Lohman's character. Justin Long, as Lohman's boyfriend, gets some screen time but it is not much of a performance even in the very final frame. That is perhaps not his fault, as this is very much Lohman's and Raver's movie.  Their acting is near-faultless.
The photography is excellent and so is the blu-ray presentation. This movie has many night scenes which have come out really well. The soundstage is constructed very well and the dialogues are good too. The included digital copy, if you are into them, also does a good job in SD. This is a movie that has it all - horror, romance, comedy, suspense and pure fun. Raimi still has not lost touch in the horror genre, though he has helmed bigger projects since.

The first 25%, 30 minutes into the movie, was just a absolute turn your stomach make you feel sick putrid story-less intro.  I stopped watching it because I was so sick, I loath horror movies that are not scary at all and just try to gross you out, THAT IS NOT HORROR.  After a few days decided to try it again because I freaking had a copy.  I started it at 30 minutes because I didn't want to be grossed out again.  After the gross stuff there is some cheap make you jump suspense crap which lasts for 10 minutes then something strange happens; it turns into a full blown comedy.  I'm serious, it's a comedy from here on out.  The entire mood of the movie just changes to comedy.  I'm not kidding.  I'm serious.

Anyway, there are some really really funny parts in the second half of this movie both because it is just plain bad CG and just because the main character just changes her whole outlook.  The entire concept of being drug to Hell is also just laughable.

This is a pathetic movie and I can't believe there are more 5 star than any other rating.  I'm rating it low because it was so foul at the beginning, if it wasn't for that then I would have rated it higher.  The scary parts are mostly suspense, not horror.  The second half is just comedy.  Even tough I rated it so low I would still say rent it once but in no way would I ever recommend buying it.

3917390,5,B002EEOE34,"Ever have that feeling that for the last ten years horror films have been repetitious series of clichs and horrific actors taking absurd premises far too seriously?  When was the last time you actually had fun watching a horror movie without it trying to work your lunch out of your stomach?  Yeah, I'm pretty tired of modern horror films to.  Luckily, a veteran of the genre has returned to teach us once more how to have fun with our horror once more.  This man is of course, the one and only Sam Raimi!

After the debacle that was `Spider-Man 3' director Sam Raimi decided ""Enough with working on a big studio's agenda"" and goes back to his roots as a B-horror filmmaker...And, boy, does he sure come out with the movie his fans have been waiting for!  `Drag Me To Hell' s that breath of fresh air (or is it rancid air?) Hollywood's needed for over a decade, and who better to bring it than the director of the Evil Dead Trilogy?

Let's go through the Raimi checklist.
Do we have an energetic lead who finds herself/himself in ridiculous situations? Yes.
Is there an evil curse pursuing our hero?  Yes.
Will the hero be repeatedly splattered in gratuitous blood and filth?  HELL YEAH!

The story is fairly simple where an aspiring bank employee, Christine Brown (Alison Lohman), just wants to get ahead in life.  One way to impress her boss is to deny a loan to an old woman who has failed to meet her payments multiple times.  Unfortunately this old woman happens to be a gypsy (perhaps the scariest old lady ever filmed; makes Norman Bate's mom look like Kermit the Frog) and she deals out eternal damnation to those who publicly shame her.  So with *little*help from her skeptical boyfriend (Justin Long), Christine has to lift the curse in three days or else spend the rest of eternity burning in Hell.

Sam Raimi is back, ladies and gentlemen.  Alison Lohman is great as the lead (never thought you could find an *attractive* young woman willing to pull these Bruce Campbell type stunts) and as a viewer you will sympathize with her, but the star of this movie really is Sam Raimi.  Over twenty years experience is put into this film as Raimi utilizes many techniques to heighten the atmosphere of this film.  Through use of shadows, and everyday sounds Raimi is able to create an eerie mood that meshes with his razor sharp sense of black comedy.

Some words of warning!

This movie will gross you out if you are not familiar with Raimi's horror. `Drag Me To Hell' is rated PG-13, but Sam Raimi has created the most borderline R-rated PG-13 movie of all time.
If you're a hardcore horror fan you may not appreciate Raimi's over the top sense of dark-camp humor in what could otherwise be a standard horror movie.

If you ARE a fan of Sam Raimi's Evil Dead films and can look past the fact that Bruce Campbell isn't the star of Drag Me To Hell, I can guarantee that you will LOVE this movie- or at least find it a welcome addition to a Hollywood that's been overrun by horror films that take themselves far too seriously.

Drag Me To Hell is some of the most fun you'll have at the movies.  Get some friends, rent the Unrated Director's Cut and prepare for a popcorn-munching goodtime!

There is NO such thing as a gory PG-13 movie.  It may have disgusting moments, but gory involves actual blood, sorry.  There are only a few corny/funny moments in the entire movie so they don't fit with the mood at all.

STARRING: Alison Lohman, Justin Long, Lorna Raver, Dileep Rao, David Paymer, Adriana Barraza, Chelcie Ross and Reggie Lee

WRITTEN BY: Sam Raimi and Ivan Raimi

DIRECTED BY: Sam Raimi

Rated: PG-13
Genre: Horror
Release Date: 29 May 2009

If the name Sam Raimi doesn't spell it out for you, then surely the title of the film will: Drag Me to Hell is exactly what you would expect it to be, folks.

The iconic director and writer of the Evil Dead trilogy (Raimi), returns to his beloved roots of the horror genre once again. Don't let its puny PG-13 rating turn you away; the film packs a punch that only true horror fans can take. If that is not enough for you, the DVD offers an alternate extended and unrated director's cut of the film.

Alison Lohman stars as Christine Brown. At first Christine seems to have everything going for her; a great job at the bank; a very sweet and understanding boyfriend; but then things start to go sour.

She overhears her boyfriend Clay (Justin Long) on the phone with his mother who is convinced that Christine may not be the right girl for him; regardless of the fact she has yet to meet Christine. Clay tries to defend her but in the end Christine fears that a part of him may wonder if his mother is right.

On top of that, she is very interested in a possible promotion at work but discovers she is evidently competing for the position with her new annoying co-worker, Stu (Reggie Lee).

There are some very well written scenes that we can all relate to in reference to working with irritating people. She and Stu are both doing their best to look good in front of their boss, Mr. Jacks (David Paymer) and when Christine agrees to pick him up a sub, Stu throws his order at her as well. He asks for his sandwich a certain way and when she returns with it, in front of Mr. Jacks, he tells her she got it wrong. We know that she didn't and she knows she didn't but Stu makes her look incompetent in front of Mr. Jacks. When Christine tries to defend herself with a mild argument, Stu makes a face and just tells her not to worry about it. It's a small and simple scene, but it was put together very well and leaves you wanting to punch Stu in the face.

When Christine asks Mr. Jacks about the promotion, he tells her that he is considering Stu because he can ""make the tough decisions."" He agrees to keep her in mind though, so she puts forth an effort to do her very best.

Then we meet Mrs. Gamush (Lorna Raver); what a hideous old woman indeed. She has disgusting false teeth that she likes to take out of her mouth and play with and absurdly gross fingernails in need of some immediate attention. You wouldn't even recognize her without the outstanding makeup they caked on her face.

Mrs. Gamush has defaulted on her mortgage loan twice. She is requesting a third extension. This is a big decision for Christine, so she takes it to Mr. Jacks.

He looks it over and simply tells her, ""It's a tough decision... your call."" Now the burden is on Christine's shoulders. She would hate to do this anyone; let alone this old woman, but she desperately needs that promotion.

She does all she can to try and help the old woman come up with a few different ideas to solve the problem, but none of them seem to work. Finally, she just tells her that the extension is out of the question; not a good idea.

Mrs. Gamush freaks out on her and causes a huge scene. She is not pleased, to say the least, and tells Christine in a ghastly, evil voice, ""You shame me!"" before she is escorted from the premises by security.

There's an awesome showdown sequence between the two gals, when Christine finds Mrs. Gamush waiting for her in the car garage. You get all of the classic slapstick and action-driven, detailed cinematography we got from Raimi's Spider-Man franchise and his Evil Dead movies. There are some very grotesque things that take place in the garage and throughout other parts of the film that are very appealing to a genuine horror fan; ""Carnage Candy"", if you will. At one point in their hellacious battle, the old woman places a curse on Christine.

Christine manages to escape and things start to get really messed up from there. She takes on some concern when she starts having disturbing visions and visits from hellish beings.

She consoles with Clay about it, but she can tell that only pushes them even farther apart. So what ever is she to do? Why, seek spiritual council of course.

Christine drags (no pun intended) Clay along to a psychic who informs her that a curse has in fact been placed upon her. She will be tormented by an evil spirit for three days before being drug off to burn in hell for all eternity.

I know the premise is a little over the top and if you've seen the film then you know that it's a tad ridiculous at times as well; but it's a fun movie. You laugh a lot, you're creeped out a great deal and you are constantly on the verge of losing your lunch; all essential elements in any great horror film.

Watching the film, it looks as though Sam Raimi literally did drag Alison Lohman to hell. He tortures this poor actress relentlessly. While she will no doubt receive zero remorse from Bruce Campbell (who was tormented by Raimi in all of the Evil Dead movies); she will certainly get it from me for what she's gone through here. She has the vilest things thrown on her face, inserted in her mouth, and clinging to her hair.

Everyone in the film plays their part well and you enjoy seeing the characters interact with each other. They are all a little off, and I think that's the point and also what makes it work so well; because the movie is out there, to say the least. Raimi's movies are a different breed all together and I really enjoy his twisted sense of humor.

What else is great about Sam Raimi's films (in addition to the fact that most of them have the legendary Bruce Campbell in them) is that he never limits himself to a single genre like so many directors do. He has some of the greatest and disgusting horrific comedies like Army of Darkness under his belt; he's made sensational thrillers like A Simple Plan and The Gift; he did the huge blockbuster Spider-Man movies; other action flicks like Dark Man and The Quick and the Dead and he even directed the dramatic baseball film For Love of the Game. Pretty much the only thing he hasn't done is a stop-animated musical with zombies; maybe that's next.",1265241600,2,6416,4.422391857506361
3917395,4,B002EEOE34,"People. Your illustrious Seer was finishing a beefsteak sandwich at Pistol Pete's Automat Submachine Shop, when I spied The First Infidelity Bank across the street. This immediately triggered one of the many misaligned brain synapses in my mind and I knew what I had to do. Yes. I had to report to all of you about ""Drag Me to Hell"". Now, mind you, as you know, your Metamorpho is into enlightenment and the progress of the human race. So taking on this subject matter is most difficult for a loving soul. However, I will because I am selfless and sacrificing my stability to do it - all for YOU. Besides, it may help me towards my personal goal towards being the very last ranked reviewer on Amazon. Who wants to be first when being last is so much more obtainable? That Metamorpho, always using deadly logic to prove his point.

I do not profess to be a horror genre expert. No. So let's get that out of the way first. I am sure that a lot of people here have seen many, many horror flicks and are better versed at advising you. Me? The extent of my experience has been ""Abbott and Costello Meet the Wolfman"". That's better than a novice now, isn't it? No? Nevermind. Let's move on. Forget I mentioned it. :(

Anyway, ""Drag Me to Hell"", I think, is a most enjoyable ride. That is, if you view it with a certain suspension of belief. Which, I am sure most of you have these days with the Government and all. I won't get too involved in the plot, since so many reviews have already spoiled it for you. However, I will tell you that this movie involves the characters of a gypsy woman and a demon. Since I have dealt with both over time, let me assure you that they are no picnic. I had to use ALL my powers to ward them off. But I survived. Barely. But, I will say that. yes, their powers really do exist. So put that Ouija Board away! Do it now!

Alison Lohman, who used to be fat, is now a Bank Representative who is being considered for a promotion. There is also a mediocre, brown nosing new hired slug also vying for the position. It is the competitive spirit that gets Alison in a lot of hot water, very gravely I might add. When she refuses a gypsy woman (Lorna Raver- who is excellent in the part) an extension on her loan, is when hell breaks loose. Literally. By the way, if anyone has any idea how false teeth can rot, please write me.

Anyway, the action revolves around a curse, how to remove the curse, and how the curse comes to dinner but overstays it's welcome. Sam Raimi (the director and writer) fills the screen with a lot of interesting facets. An example is half dream/half real episodes that infiltrate Alison's world. The lone fly meanders throughout the whole movie. An ominous symbol for sure. But the demon, it seems, can infiltrate her night, as well as day, dreams. Not only that, but I wondered how so much hair got pulled out of Alison's head and she still had no sign of it. Even at the end.

I must say, all the actors did their parts well. Justin Long as her love interest was a splendid unhelpful non-entity as well as his parents being the typical upper class snobs. Kudos to Dileep Rao as the spiritual advisor. The open look, the manner, the clothes, all fit together. Besides, see how quick he asked for money upfront? You would never find your Metamorpho doing that. But, it would be a nice gesture to offer me something for my timely advice!

Some of the special effects work and are worth watching. Others, though, aren't as good but, who cares? No one cared when Godzilla was a fake balloon. You were too involved in the story line. Admit it! In the long road, the underlying message in all this is worth noting. It's a morality tale in the final analysis. Alison had a decision to make just as we all do in life. Are you going to make a decision that your heart knows is right? Or, are you going to give in to the expectations of others? The choice was hers to make. And, you must accept what you do for there are consequences to everything. This is an interesting tale and worth a look. I'm giving it 3 1/2 stars. Certainly not bottom of the barrel, but not that good that it should be at the top.

Now people, I should advise you that your Metamorpho will be in your neighborhood to collect a small (!) donation for his fine reviews (which benefit all of you). So, just do what your heart tells you to do. If not, I will call Lorna up to take care of the matter. Her number is (666) 666-6666. I've committed it to memory.

3917396,1,B002EEOE34,"I'm probably being a bit harsh as I had high expectations, but this was very formulaic and consequently predictable movie.  I don't think there was a single surprise in the whole movie.

Worse, I can only guess at what the ""horror"" actually was.  People miraculously turning up in a location doesn't qualify nor does extensive corpse play.  On corpse play it is obvious that only one of the protagonists can actually do any acting and with the very fake ""dummy"" it was a little like the Brady Movie when the middle sister walks in with a blow up doll.

The acting was quite good and the s&eacute;ance scene was the reminiscent of the old Raimi, but even here there was nothing to add to the genre.

There are a lot of comments about the humor in the movie, but the only thing I was laughing at was how stupid I was to shell out for this movie.

My favorite scene is where Christine(Alison Lohman) falls over the casket of the Gypsy woman who may or may not have put a curse on her and the corpse spews embalming fluid all over her.  Our sense of horror is enhanced because the fetching Lohman makes for a sympathetic victim.  My reservation is at times Raimi utilizes CGI to illicit terror.

3917401,5,B002EEOE34,"In a subpar year for film, Sam Raimi's ""Drag Me to Hell"" stands as perhaps the most deliriously entertaining release to pass through America's cineplexes. Raimi's return to the horror genre is as perfect a distillation of lowbrow entertainment as one could hope to find; there is not a moment's subtlety and precious little that is in good taste. Though most horror geeks will compare it negatively to Raimi's cult ""Evil Dead"" series, ""Drag Me to Hell"" is actually a decided maturation of Raimi's horror/comedy style: while the average horror-comedy is simply a gruesome farce, ""Drag Me to Hell"" is a legitimate horror film turned totally absurd, with every element pushed one step too far.

Though the stylistic debt to the ""Evil Dead"" films is enormous, the actual story harks back to the British classic ""Night of the Demon"" and the blackly humorous horror comics of the 1950s. (Or so I'm told, on the latter point--I've not read any EC stuff.) As in ""Night of the Demon,"" ""Drag Me to Hell"" focuses on a frantic attempt to escape an impending curse, this time inflicted by an aged gypsy woman (Lorna Raver) on ingnue loan officer Christine Brown (a lovely and always very young looking Alison Lohman) after Christine refuses to give Mrs. Ganush any further extensions on her mortgage. The curse is rather unpleasant: after tormenting Christine for three days, the Lamia, a demon of the classic anthropomorphic goat type, will, yep, drag her to hell. Along for the ride are Clay Dalton (Justin Long, less annoying than you'll expect), Christine's dorky boyfriend, and Rham Jas (Dileep Rao), a fortuneteller they enlist in their struggle.

Though pseudo-intellectual critics insist on highlighting the purported timeliness of this backstory, social commentary is quickly dropped in favor of Raimi's always entertaining setpieces and the broadly drawn, almost caricatured figures. Despite the free rein the premise allows him, Raimi is more restrained than in his earlier efforts. (This isn't saying much, of course.) While ""EDII"" and ""Army of Darkness"" utilized a formless ""everything including the kitchen sink"" absurdity, ""Drag Me to Hell"" builds more like a conventional horror film, with slow burn atmospherics punctuated by self-parodically overdone jump scares giving way to the grand guignol madness of later scenes. Though the tone is somewhat different, Raimi's techniques still recall the cult classics of his past: frantic, cockeyed camerawork; murderous inanimate objects; spewing goo and, of course, flying, wild-eyed demons. The best of the horror sets are stunning: the wild, bare-knuckle parking lot brawl between Ganush and Christine is a delight, and a climactic sance is deliciously, maliciously funny. Some of the more low-key moments are equally charming, particularly a bleakly desperate evening in an all-night caf which I sadly cannot describe w/o revealing to much. With a much higher budget at his disposal, ""Drag Me to Hell"" displays a sort of slickness absent from Raimi's earlier horrors, but this cleaner, sharper look only serves to make the grotesque weirdness more striking when it comes. (By the way, those worried about the PG-13 rating are foolish--the last two ""Evil Dead"" films barely had anything that could be described as disturbing by any but the most sensitive viewers, and our steadily more desensitized culture allows the surrealist grue to remain largely in tact.) More notably, Raimi sometimes generates a sort of tension that was almost entirely absent in the last two ""Evil Dead"" films. This tension is more likely to break in humor than horror, but the effect remains impressive.

The film's air of straight-faced insanity extends to the performances. Raver's one-eyed gypsy is inconceivably repellent, though not w/o a hint of pathos, while Lohman's lost yet grasping innocent grows steadily more deranged and hostile as the end approaches. The supporting turns are uniformly one dimensional (particularly Dalton's ultra-WASP, old money parents and Reggie Lee as Christine's absurdly conniving coworker), but they're performed with an unwinking precision that wrings as much humor out of figures as possible. (Surprisingly, Long and Rao give two of the flatter turns, when they could easily have been among the most over the top of characters.)

All the ridiculousness culminates in a final twist that, while unlikely to surprise many, puts an appropriate sick joke spin on the proceedings. It is, as always, far from subtle, but it goes out with a bang, one last roaring sound cue before it fades to black. It is, all in all, very appropriate. Check it out.

Plus the scares were not scary (a haunted hanky?), and I found everything too sensational and really trying. It was a chore to sit through (awful script!), with weird gore involving body fluids and oral blood-spewing. And Raimi has a fetish about hair-pulling, and also teeth, and biting of the chin. Odd, odd, odd.

There was potential there for something good, elements from William Castle's ""Mr. Sardonicus"" to Val Lewton's films to ""Curse of the Demon"". At certain points we were actually laughing at stuff that was supposed to be frightening or creepy, and that was clearly not the intended reaction from the viewer.

There is a plot twist at the movie's climax that is like something out of ""Tales from the Darkside"" if you remember that TV series from the mid 80's; you can see it coming miles ahead.

I don't foresee myself ever having the inclination to watch this film a second time. (And I really wanted to like this flick; it has one of the best horror movie titles I've seen in a while.)",1263513600,2,1134,4.603960396039604

At some point throughout the movie you will literally laugh due to its unrealism situation and gross encounter with the main actress and the circumstances she's come abound. Not a movie to be taken serious as The Exorcist or The Amityville Horror (just to give an example).

The movie paces well and it is energized, keeping you to the edge of your seat hoping for poor Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) to find the proper spell or ritual to rid her from this eternal curse. Some scenes will be disturbing but not grotesque, making it more like clichd (basically what Sam Raimi was aiming for).

Eager to build a secure foundation for herself and her academic boyfriend, Clay (Justin Long), as well earn the respect of Clay's snobby parents, Alison eagerly pursues a promotion to assistant bank manager, a task which sees her locked in a passive aggressive struggle with weasily, conniving contemporary, Stu (Reggie Lee). During the course of a working day, Alison finds herself reluctantly forced to act as judge, jury and executioner on the estate of Sylvia Ganush (Lorna Raver), a sinister, elderly Gypsy woman who is defaulting on her mortgage. Keen to prove herself to her boss as the kind of capable employee who can make a hard judgment call, Alison goes against her better instincts and forecloses on Ganush's mortgage. But as anyone who has ever seen a horror movie knows, crossing an old Gypsy woman is never a good idea, and before long Alison finds herself pursued by a relentless demonic force that quite literally wants to drag her straight to hell...

I'll be honest. I had gone right off of Sam Raimi in recent years. I loved the ""Evil Dead"" films but absolutely despised the ""Spiderman"" films and despaired of ever seeing a decent film from the man following his mainstream success. Luckily for me though, ""Drag Me To Hell"" heralds a return to his earlier gonzo style of film-making.

Taking it's cue from M.R. James' short story ""Casting The Runes"" and any number of seventies satancentric Amercian TV movie schlockers, ""DMTH"" is a joy-ride through glorious excess and bad taste. Those familiar with the ""Evil Dead"" films and those gloriously tacky 'movies of the week' will know what to expect: its less of a horror film and more of an absurdist dark comedy which takes a subtle jab at our 'win-at-any-cost' culture of corporate success. Which is not to say that it isn't rife with gore and general ickiness. It is. Its just that its rendered in a tone more akin to that of a Tex Avery cartoon than a hardcore splatter movie (indeed, a carefully positioned and precariously suspended anvil is actually responsible for a gloriously grotesque demise at one point). Likewise, a scene in which a goat is possessed by a demonic force, and begins to bleat about how much of a ""b-e-a-a-a-i-i-i-t-ch"" our protagonist is, is a clear indicator that things should not be taken too seriously.

While its not going to be too everyone's taste, I had a ball with this film. It made me roar with laughter and grimace in equal measure. It'll confound those who aren't in on the jokes, but if you grew up on a diet of Tex Avery and films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fear-No-Evil/dp/B00009MEJQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fear No Evil</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Legend-of-Hell-House/dp/B00005LIRD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Legend of Hell House</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Curse-of-the-Demon-Night-of-the-Demon/dp/B0000694WH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Curse of the Demon / Night of the Demon</a>&nbsp;(an excellent Jacques Tourneur directed adaptation of the aforementioned M.R.

3917406,4,B002EEOE34,"Sam and Ivan Raimi have made one fun horror flick with ""Drag Me to Hell.""  While recent horror films have sunk to dreary gore-fests (inspired by the boffo box office of the ""Saw"" franchise, no doubt), ""DMTH"" is a reminder that good horror films make you smile as much as grimace.

Alison Lohman plays our heroine, the blandly-named Christine Brown.  She's a thirty-something aspirant in a small-time California bank, working diligently for the Big Promotion to Assistant Manager.  She's a small-town girl with small-town aspirations - this bank is the Dunder Mifflin of financial institutions.  But it does have one small snake in its grass, Ambitious New Guy Stu, who's also jockeying for the AM position and isn't afraid to give the boss free Lakers tickets to get them.

So, to prove that she's sufficiently hard-nosed to be AM (a nice touch from the Raimis that in order to get ahead as a banker, you have to say ""no""), Alison unwisely gets tough when a wizened gypsy (Lorna Raver) asks for a third extension on her mortgage.  Upon rejection, the gypsy turns into one of the creepiest horror villains since the shark in Jaws, only considerably more gross.  While Joe Pesci may own the record for most f-bombs in a movie thanks to ""Casino"" and ""Goodfellas,"" Ms. Raver surely holds the title for vomit-volume.

We pull for the sweet Christine, who truly believes that she's a nice person.  One wishes she had C3PO by her side to give her this movie's equivalent of ""Artoo, let the wookie win.""

But Christine is accompanied only by her geeky boyfriend, Dr. Clay Dalton (Justin Long), who is far too well-mannered to be of any help.  Why does Christine need help, exactly?  Because she has been cursed by the rejected gypsy, and it's a doozy:  a lamia will torture Christine's soul for three days, and on the next day will drag her to hell (a fate expertly set up with a chilling opening sequence).

All this is a loose plot from which the Raimis string a bunch of most-excellent horror scenes that are long on suspense and humor while also offering some genuinely scary moments.  It must be said that Ms. Raver as the gypsy is the most terrifying element of the movie - the lamia is spooky, but does not offer the genuine thrills and chills as does the wizened crone, who packs a big wallop both alive and from beyond the grave.

All in all, this is a very scary movie that is exceedingly well-made, even more so because it is safely PG-13 fare.  I only give it four stars because several of the key plot points are telegraphed far in advance and I try to save the five star reviews for horror movies for the true classics, a la the original ""Halloween.""",1262908800,3,2656,4.602972399150743
3917407,5,B002EEOE34,"Christine Brown is an ambitious, attractive, young loan officer struggling to balance her good-nature with doing what it takes to move up life's various ladders. When she encounters a decrepit gypsy woman at work one day asking for a third extension on her mortgage, Christine makes the hard decision in an attempt to earn a promotion over a ruthless competitor. This leads to Christine falling under a gypsy curse, and the rest of the film is all about Christine's downward spiral as she attempts to thwart the Lamia, a demon set on tormenting her for three days before dragging her to Hell forever. Christine enlists the aid of a fortune teller, against her boyfriend's better judgment, who provides a number of ideas to help her, though their results have actually led some fans of the film to theorize on whether or not he is in league with the demon himself.

""Drag Me To Hell"" is a great return for Raimi fans to his horror roots, studded with Evil Dead style action, camp, and over the top gross-out scenes, but set within a more thoughtful story with great performances and higher-tech effects. Allison Lohman stars as Christine, and she does a great job of seeming innocent but corruptible, while Justin Long plays her adoring boyfriend and gives his usual fine performance. Lorna Raver is fantastically upsetting as disgusting Mrs. Ganush, the old gypsy woman. The story of the film could be compared to the Stephen King story, ""Thinner"", also a great film, but ""Drag Me to Hell"" is quite a bit more exciting and fun. There are a lot of jump moments and oldschool type scares, including one of those disturbing talking animal scenes reminiscent of the old Evil Dead mounted heads, which folks may find quite laughable under some viewing circumstances, but they can be rather disturbing when you're watching alone, in the dark, in the middle of the night. In general, ""Drag Me to Hell"" seems to be a film that was pretty well received, but you still have the occasional complaint that it ""isn't scary"". I always find such complaints amusing, because often when said complainers give you examples of films they think ARE scary, they're pretty lame. I suppose what a person finds scary is going to be different from person to person. This film employs a demonic figure for the scare factor, and many folks who don't believe in such things simply don't find them scary in films. Well, what can you say to that, except try using your imagination a little... All I can say is, ""Drag Me to Hell"" is a much better film than most of the horror films we've gotten in the past 20 years, and along with ""Trick 'r Treat"", it's one of my top picks for post '80's horror. It may not be that scary to you, both those films are more thrilling than scary most of the time, but frankly, there aren't many films I would actually call truly, consistently scary anyway (films like The Exorcist and The Shining, and even the original Amityville and Night of the Living Dead), and I'd still say these have their moments. After all, have you ever watched Evil Dead 2 alone at night, in the dark?

The Blu-Ray of Drag Me to Hell looks great, but it's a bit of a disappointment in the extras department. The main extra is that you get two versions of the film, theatrical and director's cut. Well, frankly, if you give me the director's cut, I'll never watch the theatrical, so I really don't even know how they're different and having the theatrical cut is kind of wasted space. Besides that, the only bonus is the collection of Production Video Diaries. These work well as a behind the scenes featurette, so they are much appreciated. But, beyond that, not even a theatrical trailer is included. A commentary would have been great. We do get a digital copy, but I almost never use those, so another waste... Still, the movie itself is fantastic and I'm glad to own it! I do highly recommend it, especially if you are familiar with Raimi's earlier work and will be able to handle the few campier moments.",1262822400,5,3988,4.647308781869689
3917408,3,B002EEOE34,"I didn't get to see this movie until it came out on Blu-Ray, so by that point I had heard almost nothing but rave reviews and was really looking forward to it. And it was okay, moderately suspenseful, but overall left me wondering, ""That's it? Did I miss something?""

It's hard to pinpoint any major flaw with the film, but several small factors contributed to my disappointment. First of all, it wasn't quite the blood bath I was expecting it to be. Not that a horror movie needs to be gory to be enjoyable, but when it is, it gives the feeling that things are actually happening. In this, most of the scares are caused by loud noises that make you jump, cartoonish-looking CPG shadows, or other ""false alarms."" I can totally appreciate the film-making technique of building suspense and not being overly graphic, but usually it's building towards something bigger, and a lot of this just seemed like ""scare for scare's sake."" Not to mention the brief appearance of a talking goat which just looks like a Muppet on crack. In fact the whole sance scene was laughable. The sad part is I think it was meant that way.

On the plus side, I liked the general storyline. It wasn't the most original I've seen, but I've always had an interest in curses and demon possessions and whatnot so I kept an open mind. The acting was decent and I liked the twist ending, which I admit I didn't see coming, plus despite the lack of blood and guts there were some truly gross-out moments. And of course every scene with the old gypsy woman was amusing. All my gripes listed above are probably just due to my personal taste and maybe shouldn't be taken out on the film itself, but I do think it would have benefitted from eliminating some of the comedic undertones and played it strictly horror/drama. The Exorcist this ain't. But, in the end, it did entertain me and I even watched it more than once. I guess that after being hyped up so much I couldn't help but be a little more critical than I normally would be of a movie like this.",1262736000,2,2018,4.466124661246613

A banking loan officer and normally a very good-hearted person, Christine any other day would've been more charitable towards the old Gypsy woman about to be evicted. But Christine is up for a promotion, and her bank manager is looking for someone who can make the tough decisions. In an ill-timed moment, she chooses the Gypsy crone with the dead eye to prove her salt. She'll regret this.

Who knew a lace hanky could be so frightening? DRAG ME TO HELL returns Sam Raimi to his horror roots, and it's like he never left. This time around, he turns his eye on gypsies and curses and comes up with a fun, gleeful slice of scary. DRAG ME TO HELL features the same frenetic touch, the same kinetic energy, and bits of humor that made the EVIL DEAD series so damn memorable. We also get the return of the startling jitter cam and the creaky noises and the purposely over-the-top bits, specifically those possessed cackling thingees floating and cavorting in the air. Ah, man, it's like old times.

Alison Lohman shoulders the load, and she's terrific, metamorphosing from sweet, nice girl to poor terrified soul frantically seeking to reverse the old Gypsy woman's curse (because in three days' time, she gets dragged to hell). Raimi's build-up gets to you, and I'm liking how he creeps you out even in the broad daylight moments. ""A dark spirit has come upon you,"" an Indian seer solemnly intones, and even Christine's skeptical boyfriend yukking it up in the background doesn't keep that tingle from darting up my spine. The chilling events Christine experiences soon afterwards, they're all vintage Sam Raimi, and respect must go to all the sequences with the terrifying Gypsy witch. So, a lot of wicked scary moments and the occasional uneasy chuckle. Alison Lohman isn't in Bruce Campbell's league when it comes to getting down and dirty in Raimi's horror features (and where is Bruce's cameo, by the way?), but she absolutely nails it as the lead in this one. And a nod also goes to the guy playing the earnest Indian mystic.

Justin Long, he's annoying and continues to be the overwhelming reason I don't buy a Mac (but also 'cause I'm cheap).

It's nice to see that, even after all the big budget, critically acclaimed stuff, Sam Raimi still joneses for what sparked his early directing career. You can still eyeball his trademark filmmaking style in his current blockbusters, but there's a polish to it nowadays. But DRAG ME TO HELL takes him back to his raw beginnings, and this is Sam Raimi at his most playful, the camera skittering around like mad, the sheer energy onscreen achieving frenzied stages.

You won't get those back folks.

Alison Lohman and Justin Long are two good actors, Justin does great with comedies and we all know that Alison can do drama, neither are put to good use with this script, or with Raimis direction. A bank worker, hopeful to be promoted, tells an old gypsy lady that she cannot extend the loan on her house. The gypsy then curses the girl and thus begins the drag down to hell, or really thus begins a complete adventure into ""been there, seen that, where is my refund"" The Saw movies correctly use the gross out horror, at least its original. Drag me to hell uses the same gag over and over again, the gypsy vomiting various materials into our poor girls mouth, gumming her in the interim. Over use of CGI, and poor animation leaves you wondering if you are supposed to be scared at all? I mean even the Evil Dead had those moments where the slapstick horror was put aside for some creepy moments, this movie had zero of that. I felt like I was watching every single bad SyFy made for tv movie ever made! Cmon now, a talking goat? a fake dead kitten? shadows under the door? flies into noses? I was so bored out of my mind!

I wouldnt recommend this to any fan of horror, Sam Raimi, or even to anyone who likes movies in general. Watching grass grow is more interesting.",1260748800,13,1943,4.4094707520891365

3917424,5,B002EEOE34,"I've been a huge fan of Sam Raimi since I watched a little low budget gore fest called The Evil Dead.  Anyone who is a fan of the director will agree that The Evil Dead trilogy is pure genius.  The punches of comedy mixed in with scares and gore is a combination that no one does better.

So, I was excited to see Drag Me to Hell as I've heard that it was Raimi's return to horror.  I was not disappointed.  I won't go into plot analysis because you can read the product description and get that info.  But I will certainly talk about what made this movie so good.

With Alison Lohman's character's first encounter with evil the fun begins.  The fight in the parking garage is vintage Raimi, complete with the crazy camera action and slapstick that made Army of Darkness a good horror/action/comedy mix.  The over-the-top gore starts soon after with one of the most disturbing nightmare scenes I've seen.  The film never lets up with the gore and comedy, and there are some very effective jump out and scare ya moments.  The scene when they are trying to drive the Lamia out (which included a possessed goat and Evil Dead demon voices) is pure Raimi, and just about any fan would agree.

I loved the ending, although it was easy to see it coming.  I really did not have any complaints with this film except, where was the Bruce Campbell cameo?",1260230400,,1343,4.43265306122449

There are no decapitated heads or entrails strewn on the floor.  But be prepared to be plenty grossed out, and on the edge of your seat.  I'm not sure who's scarier, the old woman or the demon.

3917426,2,B002EEOE34,"From Director Sam Raimi comes an absolute piece of junk. At least, that's what we thought of Drag Me To Hell - our movie of the day.

Every year when we get our Christmas tree, we choose a movie or two to watch to get us in the mood so to speak. This year we chose Drag Me To Hell. I never said we chose a holiday movie, just a movie, and this choice fits in with our horror needs...anyway.

What a big pile of crap. First there was absolutely nothing unique about the movie or the underlying plot. There have been any number of stories about a curse being placed on someone and they try to fight it off either by passing it along to someone else or finally succumbing to it. This movie was no different, only with mediocre acting, gore effects, and a talking goat.

Justin Long from the ""I'm a PC, I'm a Mac"" commercials is the male lead in this movie, although he really doesn't serve much of a purpose because he can't see any of the ""cursey"" things that are going on. (the entire scene with his parents also serves no purpose whatsoever so you can ignore that scene) The one and only one purpose Justin served was at the very end of the movie, which I'll get to in a moment. Only the female lead can see any of the impacts of the curse because she's the one who was cursed (by a gypsy woman who wanted a 3rd extension on her home loan so she wouldn't lose her house and the female lead wouldn't give it to her).

I should mention that there is a side plot about her trying to get a promotion to assistant manager at the bank, but she is sabotaged by a co-worker. This serves absolutely no purpose in the movie so you can safely ignore it.

Once the curse takes hold, the girl tries to do what she can to get rid of it including the cold blooded murder of her cat. And if that wasn't enough to make you love the movie, let's bring on a seance and a goat. And not just any goat, a goat that the evil spirit takes over turning it into a talking goat who yells curse words and has big cartoon eyes. Too bad they couldn't kill the goat fast enough and destroy the spirit before it took over someone else and was subsequently banished from the room.

Predictability continues as the female lead must make a choice - ""Who can I give the curse to? How can I find someone else who deserves to die? Wait, what if I give the curse back to the old woman who gave it to me in the first place??""

Oh that's right, the old woman is dead now. I guess we'll have to dig her up and shove that curse (imbued inside a coat button) down her throat. If you've ever dug a hole you'll understand that a 120lb girl who works at a bank could NEVER dig up a 6 foot deep coffin by herself in the pouring rain. Ever.

But magically she does, and she shoves that curse right down the dead woman's throat. Well, she would have if she had bothered to open the envelope to check to make sure it was actually the button she was shoving down the dead woman's throat instead of a special coin that she gave to her boyfriend. But had she checked, the whole ending would have been ruined for us the viewer.

We all know that the curse wasn't given back to the old woman...the button is now accidentally in the possession of the boyfriend (due to a convenient ""envelope swap"") and he just can't wait to give it to his girlfriend, along with an engagement ring...but gosh, she bought a new coat! Now he can't be all sentimental and give her the button back. No wait, don't back away from me toward the train tracks! It's just a button! Oh no, you fell down between the tracks and our train is coming! Someone save her!

*gasp* The ground just opened up beneath her! Someone help! Oh my gosh now I can finally see the curse. I could never see any of the curse before but now I can see it dragging her to hell! Oh no, now we can't get married, and I still have the button!

That means there could be a sequel!",1260057600,3,3871,4.127490039840637

Well, it's not so much similar as a remake. Although Curse of the Demon is a bit hokey in places it is very good, and incidentally is rated and reviewed higher than Drag Me to Hell. I've often thought it was prime material for a remake.

Watching Drag Me to Hell, it seemed that Alison Lohman was very similar to Kirsten Dunst from his Spiderman films. Maybe Dunst was unavailable ha-ha. Anyway, DMTH was a great return to his roots for Sam Raimi. Hopefully he enjoyed it enough to consider doing some more horror. 5 stars!",1259971200,,902,5.352112676056338

While the ending comes as unexpected, it does not make up for the rest of the 2 hours of my life that was wasted watching it.  Please, look elsewhere if you're looking to be scared, and reserve this movie for a laugh with some drunk friends.

3917434,5,B002EEOE34,"I honestly watched this movie simply for the title..""Drag me to hell"".  It just sounded so epically B-movie I couldn't pass it up.  I probably rated the movie so high because I started with extremely low expectations (I am talking sci-fi channel movie expectations) so I was completely taken with this dark, deep and SUBTLE movie..gasp did I just say subtle?

Yes, this movie is as subtle as it can be.  I don't mean ""you don't see the demon subtle"", there is plenty of devil-goat action.  I am referring to the character development and the progression of the main.  It starts off with Christine Brown getting the short end of the stick in her job at the bank as a loan officer.  To try to get ahead and appear ruthless, an attempt to appease her dreadful boss, she denies an extension to an old woman.  Unsuspecting it turns out this woman is a gypsy and proceeds to exact creepy-old-woman revenge by cursing her.  This curse entitles mental torment from a goat-devil for 3 days while Christine looks for ways to break it before being sent to hell.

The elements of the movie are particular good.  The acting is actually not completely over the top, expect of course the old woman.  Alison Lohman was able to pull off Christine's subtle (again with that word...) mental progression.  The dialog actually lends itself well to this by showing the change in her personality (here I think of the line said by a vegetarian, ""oh, cats come and go""...).  Justin Long was also really good as the boyfriend, supportive and never taking the attention away from the meat of the story.

I think the setting and character outfits in of themselves help show, rather than having the dialog tell with exposition, the subtle changes in the main character.  For example the outfits Christine wears when she thinks everything's ok is more reminiscent of 50's housewives, while in the graveyard she's in a tank, much more inline with the traditional horror female lead.

My favorite part was probably the music...it was down right creepy.  Well placed tweaks in the instruments (not a music person, don't know what they are called) set the mood better than traditional 'jump' drums and sounds.

Now if the subtlety of the music, set and costume hasn't sold you on this movie yet, I have one more thing left to say.  At one point in this movie Christine gets to make a choice, a tough choice that would challenge any human being alive (or should at least).  This additionally philosophy (*gasp* words I never expected to write in a horror movie review) really adds depth.  This movie isn't obviously for everyone, but I really think horror fan's won't be disappointed and will be pleasantly surprised that good horror movies can be made in 2009.",1259625600,,2726,4.718816067653277

3917447,5,B002EEOE34,"Those who still remember Bruce Campbell and his character ""Ash"" will welcome the director Sam Raimi's return to the horror genre. Sam Raimi's approach to the genre is an interesting blend of orthodox scares and tongue-in-cheekness. Something ridiculous happens in the middle of horrifying events, and the film's tone suddenly shifts from dead serious to downright silly.

A young (and a bit ambitious) bank loan officer Christine (Alison Lohman) denies an old lady named Sylvia (Lorna Raver) an extension. Perhaps Christine shouldn't have done that. Sylvia puts a curse on Christine, who starts seeing and hearing weird things. Her boyfriend Clay (Justin Long) doesn't take her story seriously at first, but even the confirmed skeptic realizes that Christine needs a help ... right now.

You should remember ""Drag Me to Hell"" is from the director who once did the famous ""Farewell to Arms"" joke. Like the cult classic ""Evil Dead"" series, ""Drag Me to Hell"" is really scary when it wants to, but the scares come not from the amount of blood or body counts,, but from the director's nice camera works. (Actually, there is one very ""gory"" scene involving our heroine and her unreliable boss David Paymer, but I believe this will rather make you laugh.)

As the film's old Universal logo suggests, ""Drag Me to Hell"" is part a throwback to good, old-fashioned tradition of horror films. My only complaint is not its ""silly"" part (which I loved); it is the ending that is, I think, a bit obvious.

1) Digital Copy- I'm sure someone out there appreciates digital copy, but I don't have a use for it. I'm not going to watch a full movie on my ipod, and when watching a movie on my laptop it is just as easy to watch it on Blu-ray.
2) Production Video Diaries- It's about half an hour of brief behind the scenes moments. A more thorough doc would have been nice.
All that I ask for is a commentary and maybe a few deleted scenes. I guess we will have to wait for the anniversary edition.
As for the ""Unrated"" version, it only differs from the theatrical cut in alternate versions of two scenes.  **Spoiler: Christine's nose bleed becomes a bloody projectile regurgitation and her animal sacrifice also receives some extra blood. ** I assume that the versions of these scenes in the theatrical version were shot specifically to avoid R-rated territory.

There are lots of dark moments and they don't suffer from grain or noise. The sound is just as good, the music is really spread out on the sound stage.  This is a really unsettling and spoky sound mix.  There are two versions of the film, I liked the pg-13 a little better.  There is one extra, a production diary which is great but leaves you wanting much more.

Now the film:  This a a horror comedy which I found to be much more scary than funny.  There are a ton of gross out moments though which involve a lot of of goo.  The story is a woman gets cursed by a gyspy and has to find a way to escape the demon which is coming for her. The charicters and story are well developed which makes you care and keeps you in suspense.  The way the lima stalks our heroin is wondefully done, the shadows and growling are my favorit bits.  The way the leading lady changes as she gets more and more scared as time runs out is well writen and acted.  The supporting cast is wonderfull as well and keeps things alive and interesting.

His in-your-face camera-work, not to mention preoccupation with demonology is here in full force. The story, which involves a banker cursed by a gypsy woman after refusing to extend a home loan, is both contemporary and tight as a drum. There's a fight scene between the lead and an old gypsy woman that rivals any of the high flying and kinetic sequences in his ""Spider-Man"" trilogy, and a few expertly done gross-outs that had me wincing on more than one occasion. And when we get to the sance sequence you can't help but smile at the visual tricks he appropriates from his earlier work. Drag Me To Hell is probably Raimi's scariest film, quite an accomplishment considering that it's his first non-R rated horror opus (the unrated cut has a few more seconds of gore, but nothing that makes the film any more effective).

It seems that the road to hell is not paved with good, intentions, flying limbs,
terrifying monsters, or anything remotely interesting.  It is paved with mucus.
That's right.  I won't say it again, though the movie did, ad nauseum.  Yes, I said it.  (I watched the unrated cut.  The theatrical might have less.  I didn't check.)

The surprise trick ending was right out of those Victorian fireside tales.  In other words, so fresh.

It doesn't seem like I wanted to like this film, but I really, really did.

A fragile story is used to create a new myth (which was not bad, but the plot was so weak I could care less about the legend), does not make me like or care about any of the characters.

Christine Brown (unfortunately played by Alison Lohman) is a nice farm girl, trying to be a big city girl.  She has a successful and rich boyfriend (Justin Long, who is super weak...I like him better in Mac commercials), a job she is good at, a promotion waiting for her, plus she is just as sweet as can be.  But she makes a costly decision when she decides to be the business minded city girl, instead of the sweet friendly farm girl.  A curse followed by many gory gross out moments later, and the whole time I am telling myself, at least this movie will end the right way.

Weak acting, a strange story line, scenes that go on far too long, ridiculous over-the-top gross out antics: this movie is just bad.  I like Evil Dead, but that was bad in a fun way; this is a bad movie.  I think maybe Sam Raimi wanted to make a more terrifying film, and then realized it was not going to happen so went with kitsch instead.

Brilliant and old-school style supernatural horror thriller from co-writer and director Sam Raimi is a brilliant comeback for him after doing ""Spider-Man"". Here he goes back to ""Evil Dead"" style terroritory on this movie including the use of his famed camera trickery with a dark sense of horror comedy thrown in it including some gore. The film has the feel of those classic 50's and 60's style supernatural movies of yore, the acting is quite good and the make-up with special effects are extraordinary. I also like the storyline in this movie about curses and the occult, it's perhaps the best horror movie of the year.

3917475,3,B002EEOE34,"""Drag Me to Hell"" is a pulpy supernatural horror co-written and directed by Sam Raimi, who does a fine job with middle-budget thrills and chills after three big budget Spiderman movies. Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) is a loan officer in a Los Angeles bank, competing with an ambitious, brown-nosing co-worker for an Assistant Manager position. Her boss (David Paymer) is looking for someone who can ""make the tough decisions"". So, when an elderly Gypsy woman named Sylvia Ganush (Lorna Raver) asks for a third extension on her mortgage payment, Christine refuses to accommodate her. The old woman proves more vigorous than she looks, and, after attacking Christine, curses her with the Lamia, a demonic beast who will drag her soul to Hell.

The opening sequence is corny, and the final third of the film, where interruptions in the action are shorter, isn't entirely satisfying. ""Drag Me to Hell"" excels in the middle, from the point of Christine's first encounter with Mrs. Ganush to when she settles on a course of action, because it is during this time that her experiences come closest to reality. It capitalizes on fear of the unknown, fear of the dead, fear of insanity. Lorna Raver deserves a lot of credit for her fantastically physical performance of a very nasty spirit. The use of a ""seer"" (Dileep Rao) to advise Christine about her plight is a weak plot device, and this film exploits negative Gypsy stereotypes to their fullest.  But it has some creepy moments, and I appreciated that CGI was not used indiscriminately.

The DVD (Universal 2009): The disc contains both a theatrical version and an ""Unrated Director's Cut"" of the film. The unrated cut is actually seconds shorter than the theatrical version and contains a little more gore. They are both about 99 minutes. The only bonus feature is ""Production Video Diaries"" (35 min). Introduced by actor Justin Long, who played Christine's boyfriend, these are 14 short films about the production. There is a set tour, segments on sound design, makeup effects, visual effects, and more. Sam Raimi does not comment in any of the videos, but we hear from the cast and creative crew. The videos are interesting and short enough that they are never boring. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH, Spanish, French.

As long as its mildly entertaining I have a very open mind about anything involving ghouls and ghosts.  I am familiar with the Raimi Evil Dead movies and its comedic presentation of the horror genre.  Much of its charm came from its very rough feel, and lets be honest, Bruce Campbell.  The dude creates a very likable character that makes the Evil Dead movies ""fun"" to watch.

Lets fast forward to Drag Me To Hell.  After seeing all the stellar reviews from ""user opinions"" I decided to make this a priority to watch.  To be blunt, the movies just sucks.  There is nothing mildly entertaining about the story, the special effects are a joke (not a funny joke at that), and the horror element is very light, perhaps suited for a 10-year old.  Maybe if the main character were Jim Carrey or Will Ferrell this could've been a modern horror-comedy extravaganza, but even the horror element was just stupid and uninteresting.

The last time I saw the Evil Dead movies was about 14 years ago around the age of 12. It was on basic cable and I believe I only saw bits and pieces of the 2nd and 3rd installments. I don't remember too much of the movies themselves, but I distinctly remember being freaked out by the crawling hand and mini Ashes, though at the same time thoroughly amused at how the ""horror"" progressed itself. Almost a decade and a half later and with a growing knowledge of things in general I now realize that it was that same Sam Raimi who did the Spider-man movies I grew up watching and idolizing that made these scary, yet silly horror pieces known as The Evil Dead and Army of Darkness films. I never was much of a horror fan growing up. All I kept seeing were slasher titles that always had some unstoppable psycho sneaking around, popping out of the shadows, and gutting those idiotic, illogical, and horny teens like a bunch of crash test dummies with voice boxes added to them for ""dramatic"" effect. I was more a fan of psychological horror and the occasional mix of occult/black magic. Or heck, at least a film where the protagonists were smart enough to actually fight their pursuers back. Having not caught this fine movie in theaters, I later got the chance to give this BD a rental and enjoyed it so much I watched it two days in a row and liked it even more the 2nd time around. Drag Me to Hell is a fun, energetic, and very entertaining romp that gives me a little taste of everything: action, drama, that goofy, over-the-top brand of Raimi-comedy that he creates so well, just enough dread and horror to keep you on the edge of your seat, cheap scare tactics via an excellent sound design and creepy musical score, and even a little of that bizarre, morbid set design rivaled only by one Tim Burton. There's not a lot of depth to the story or characters, but I was more enthralled by the imagination of it all and how well it managed to keep me entertained from beginning to end with the presence of some demonic spirits, ghostly images, flying objects, crazy gypsies, blood, gore, and a goat sacrifice just to name a few things. I highly recommend this for fans familiar with Raimi's directing style or those looking for an entertaining horror flick minus the machete-wielding superhuman or dream-invading, overly sunburned whatever he is.

Video - 5.0

Drag Me to Hell is presented by Universal Studios in VC-1 with an aspect ratio of 2.39:1 and continues to showcase their transfer abilities with the big-budget films from today's market. Colors are very vibrant, but not overly saturated to preserve the dark and drab atmosphere of the movie revealing a great balance of black levels and shadow delineation, especially in the parking garage and cemetery scenes. In fact, the transfer is so clean, it even accentuates upon some of the ""bad"" CG during those ""hahaha, eww gross"" moments. Skin tones are dead accurate (yes, that's a double entendre) from the darkest of nights to the brightest of days with all but the CG blood looking as real as it can get. Even the natural lighting (as explained in the very brief special features) displays itself very well without presenting any kind of extraneous grain. For the kind of film it is, Drag Me to Hell looks gorgeous.

Audio - 5.0

In addition to its commendable video transfer, Drag Me to Hell is also accompanied by an outstanding DTS-HD track that really makes the movie. Directionality and separation are flawless from the creaking of wood to the howling of wind to the screeching of demons and objects flying all over the place when things get crazy. Your surround speakers and sub-woofer will generate their money's worth in fidelity with just the movie's opening sequence, let alone through the rest of the film's chaotic and aggressive sound effects. As I mentioned in the movie review about ""cheap scares,"" another of the special features addresses the issue of sound design and exactly what Raimi had intended for the audience to hear. Many a time when I watch movies using this tactic, I'd always tense up at the expectancy of a loud and overwhelming crash, scream, roar, etc. Needless to say, the sound mixers of this movie do a stupendous job of following Raimi's orders by eliminating music and dialogue and adding just the right sound at just the right level every single time. It's scary and it's loud, but it's never too loud. Kudos to the guys that mixed it and to Universal for a reference-quality track.

Extras - 2.5

It's a cool, but very truncated production video diary presented by Justin Long. Basically, we get to see how certain sets were constructed, wire work, special effects, some make up, sound design, photography, and the usual. It's interesting, don't get me wrong. It's just darn short is all. Add on to the fact that there's not even a director's commentary, and you've got one disappointed fan. But you know what? That's okay because the movie still a lot of fun, even if it is accompanied by mere vignettes of behind-the-scenes footage (all in HD, by the way).

Overall - 4.0

While the supplements could've been much more in depth, I believe the entertainment/replay value and A/V quality alone are worth buying, especially for fans of Sam Raimi. Drag Me to Hell is somewhat of a return to Raimi's roots from his goofy-horror, Evil Dead days. The movie is a wild and kinetic mix of B-movie-style scares and laughs that achieve a level of dramatic edge, yet provide for just a little more than an hour and a half of good times. I can honestly say that I haven't been this entertained by a film of this genre in a long while. If not a must-own title for fans, then it's at least worth a rental for whenever the mood strikes you.",1256169600,,5737,4.62770137524558
3917485,3,B002EEOE34,"My apologies to William Shakespeare for playing with the title of one of his plays, but ""Drag Me To Hell"" Sam Raimi's (the genius behind the Evil Dead trilogy) return to horror turns out to be one-third of a good scare flick then it just implodes. Alison Lohmann playing an ambitious bank loan officer, in order to show her boss she can be ruthless, rejects a haggish gypsy woman's plea to extend her credit for her already defaulting mortgage.  A neat Sam Raimi touch is, the gypsy woman has dentures so rotten and jagged, it looks like she opens tin soup cans with them. And during the knockabout catfight between Lohmann and the hag in a parking garage, the woman loses her dentures and proceeds to gum her adversary. Funny and creepy at the same time. It's during this fight the button comes into play.  Ripping a button from Lohmanns jacket, the gypsy puts a curse on the button, hands it back to Lohmann and proclaims, ""Soon you will be begging me"". The rest of the first third concerns frightening visions and assorted things that go bump in the night.

The second third, and the start of Raimi's stumble concerns a psychic reader and a exorcist-for-hire that leads to a spectacular seance/exorcism that is more silly than scary. Maybe Raimi's intention was for this sequence to be outrageously outlandish but believe me, it's just silly.

The last third concerns the cursed button-an envelope and a ""surprise"" that fools no-one watching the film, and is insulting that the director thought he could mis-lead a  viewer with half a brain.

Nice try, Mr Raimi but may I suggest you re-watch your Evil Dead trilogy and see just how clever you can be with a much smaller budget and no buttons.",1256083200,3,1696,4.674496644295302

One scene that stands out as being particularly bad was when she gets attacked by the old lady in her car.  Okay I understand that her manager asked her to take a file home to review it.  It was A FILE.  Why did she have the entire contents of her desk with her.  OH thats right to try to make the scene funny by having her fight the lady off with her stapler.

Okay.  If I had a spurting nosebleed all over my boss, I'd be apologizing like crazy.  If I knocked over a corpse and it started spewing fluids into my mouth, I'd be sick as a dog.  Alison Lohman's character does not have these reactions, so I found some of this movie unbelievable.

Onward:  The rest of the story is a pretty good horror tale, with good performances from Lohman, Long, and the wonderful David Paymer.  The woman playing Mrs. Ganush is great as well, at first touching and then horrifying as she escalates vengeance against poor Christine Brown, who does not deserve the suffering she gets.  In some ways I was also reminded of the tv series Supernatural, which deals with demons, demonic attacks, and innocent people being tormented for no good reason.

Some of the horror scenes are also funny in an outrageous way--you will see what I mean.

If you realize then that you don't like campy, shock, gross-out horror that can be scary and funny at the same time, you should know to avoid this one.  Not everyone will be okay with a talking goat demon.  I, on the other hand, think this was the best horror movie that's been released in years.

As good and creepy as most of this movie was, I was actually happiest with the beginning and ending.  Raimi knows how to end a movie.

I have to agree with all the other reviews on here, it's really cool to see Sam Raimi, Ivan Raimi back to old form, doing a simplistic, not over the top, big budget Hollywood picture!
The movie delivers in spades! Scenes that make you jump, scenes that make you go Ughhhh Nasty, scenes that make you laugh. This is a classic horror movie, and Alison Lohman holds her own as the main lead, and that she is very cute too! There were scenes I believe she was channeling Evil Dead, or so I thought that's how the filmmakers wanted it to be, just some of the lines she says, reminded me of everyone's cult movie favorite Hero Ash. Such as ""I'm gonna get me some!"" I just love it!! Lohman's  delivery of it, hit it right on the nail.

Anyways fantastic story, great camera work and lighting and the music was just right, scares were great. Over all fun horror movie to watch!

3917505,5,B002EEOE34,"Finally!  After years of hopes and rumors Sam Raimi returns to top form with an imaginative supernatural horror-comedy flick he dubs a ""spook-a-blast"".  Most fans of the Evil Dead films will be thrilled to see that Raimi makes anew the elements from the series that launched his career into a new film crafted for today's audiences.  We are introduced right away to the film's antagonist, The Lamia, a demonic goatlike spirit and discover its malevolence and lack of passion towards a young latin boy who makes the mistake of his short life when he steals a necklace from an unforgiving gypsy.  Then the opening credits roll and we fast forward a few decades to meet Christine, played by Alison Lohman, who's a loan officer at a bank who experiences a bit of her own financial crisis when, in hopes of impressing her boss and earning a promotion, she denies an elderly gypsy woman an extension on her home loan.  Christine, who used to be an overweight farm-girl, has a heart and knows better but she feels that she has to prove herself not only to her boss, but also to her boyfriend's bourgeois parents who think she isn't worthy.  The gypsy passionately begs Christine to rethink her decision but Christine calls security to escort the seemingly crazy woman out.  That move seriously pisses off the gypsy.  She confronts Christine later in the parking garage and after a knock down drag out fight Sam Raimi style, the gypsy sicks the curse of the Lamia on Christine.  Christine begins to suspect right away something is wrong but her boyfriend, although supportive, is very skeptical to her belief something is after her.  Christine seeks out help from a psychic and does whatever she can to free herself from the curse before it's too late.

Drag Me To Hell received nearly unanimous positive reviews from audiences and critics alike but of course didn't do as well at the box office as I had hoped.  That's pretty sad IMHO.  I love Horror-Comedies, some of the best being American Werewolf in London, Peter Jackson's Dead Alive, the Evil Dead films and of course Shaun of the Dead.  This film ranks right up there with the best of them.  There are plenty of laughs and frights; Christine's progressively disturbing encounters with the Lamia are about as frightening as the demon haunting Linda Blair in the Exorcist.  Meanwhile, her encounters with Ms. Ganush are frightening and over the top hilarious when it comes to the grotesque gags Raimi puts on the viewer.  There are countless nods to the Evil Dead series, the yellow Oldsmobile, the eye popping makeup and special effects, the voices of the demonically possesed, the painted outlines of tools in the tools shed...they go on and on and it's great to see Raimi playfully acknowledge where he got his start.  The film is quite slick even with a relatively low budget. Raimi, now a pro-filmmaker, is very crafty at using music, sound, and effects to their utmost potential. Therefore I think it's vital to watch this film at night with the surround sound turned up! It's definitely a nerve wrenching experience! There's a social message her as well albeit a simple one: The Banks are too greedy and don't piss off elderly gypsies, or you'll be dealing with much more than killer hankerchiefs as a result.

3917510,4,B002EEOE34,"A quick synopsis of the plot: A young woman shames a gypsy while trying to get ahead in her job. She knew it was the wrong thing to do, but she did for the sake of her career. The gypsy returns to put a curse on our young protagonist that will literally drag her to hell in three days. It's a race to see if she can find a way to break the curse before a vile demon claims its soul. Allison Lohman does a good job as Christine and Justin Long plays the ""nice guy"" boyfriend just trying to help his girlfriend as she quickly loses her mind.

Simple premise that is brilliant in execution. Sam Raimi keeps you jumping in your seat from the time the movie starts to the end of its 139 minute runtime. You should be warned, Drag Me To hell is not gory, has no nudity, very little bad language and very limited special effects. The scares are brought through sound and Sam Raimi's trademark quick cuts and frantic zoom shots. If you are looking for a slasher flick, look elsewhere. What you will find is a movie that is relentless in its scares. There is also a fair bit of humor and slapstick action that Raimi is also known for. My only real knock on this movie is that despite being a return to form for Raimi, he working an old bag of tricks really hard. He doesn't do anything new, but what he does, he does exceptionally well.

 I'll mention the sound again. If you don't have a home theater, a lot of the movie's punch will be lost. Becuase it's not a slasher flick and is relatively low budget, shadows and sound are what make this movie great, not the special effects. The movie comes equipped with both rated and unrated versions. I did see Drag Me To hell in the theater, but didn't notice and signifigant changes from one version to the next. I'll have to watch the PG-13 version again to see what was added, but it should be noted the run times are identical. As far as the Blu Ray goes, the picture is crystal clear, as you would expect. There are no shots that would qualify as ""reference quality"", but it still looks great.

Unfortunately Drag Me To Hell was passed over at the box office and it seems that moviegoers taste in Horror is excessivly violent (Saw franchise) or exceedingly stupid (name your badly acted, poorly made PG-13 remakes of japanese horror films).

3917512,4,B002EEOE34,"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS POSSIBLE SPOILERS (EXPRESSED AS VAGUELY AS POSSIBLE).  This film stands tall in the company of recent horror films (the only one that surpasses it is ""Trick r Treat"").  Two things especially stand out:
--It's a gross-out film, but not in the usual blood-and-dismemberment mode.  Few of us today really fear being murdered and dismembered--but in these days of HIV and ""swine flu"", we do have powerful fears of contamination:  ""That lady just sneezed near me!  That guy wants to shake my hand and I just saw him wipe his nose!  I can't take communion at church anymore because we all drink from the same cup!  That guy has a nosebleed--stay away from me, I don't want that stuff on me!""  ""Drag Me to Hell"" plays powerfully, excrutatingly, on those fears.  There's plenty of saliva, phlegm, blood (very little of it from actual violence), and undefinable bodily fluids on the screen.  This gets under one's skin much more than murder and mayhem--because it touches on things that we are actually afraid of.
--There are a lot of clever allusions to one of the all-time great horror films, ""Night of the Demon"" (aka ""Curse of the Demon"").  The stalking demon; the inanimate object that suddenly takes on a life of its own (the slip of paper in ""Night of the Demon"", a scarf in ""Drag Me to Hell""); the imperative need to pass the curse on to someone else; and the climax on the railroad tracks.  It represents a wonderful homage to a great horror film--and the highest praise I can give ""Drag Me to Hell"" is to say that it's worthy to stand in the same company as the 50s film to which it pays tribute.
Also--no nudity, no sexual content to speak of, little to no profanity, minimal violence--which allows the little violence there is to have maximum impact.  A great film for fans of classic horror.",1255564800,9,1816,4.6375

The only reason I can think that this movie is getting good reviews is because of Raimi's return to horror, this time with a big budget. Did this movie have it's entertaining moments? Yes, but they were very few and far between. Overall, Drag Me to Hell is a movie chock full of bad CGI, visual jokes that just fail to work, and absolutely terrible acting. As far as the terrible acting, it works in the Evil Dead trilogy because its so campy and over the top, it never takes itself too seriously. You never really feel that way in DMtH, you just feel like your watching a big budget movie full of C-list actors. Without rambling anymore, if you want to see a good horror/comedy, dust off your copy of Shaun of the Dead or shell out the money to see Zombieland in the theater. Those movies do it right, Drag Me to Hell just makes me hope Sam Raimi gets back to making superhero movies really soon",1255564800,5,1140,4.282407407407407
3917514,3,B002EEOE34,"The '09 release 'Drag Me To Hell' is a well produced horror film with overall solid special effects ( particularly in the seance sequence), popular, well liked stars (Alison Lohman & Justin Long) and a well-conceived if not totally original storyline. Alison Lohman is cast perfectly in the role of poor, cursed Christine Brown, capturing the necessary elements of beauty, innocence and strength when needed. A story of this nature requires a persona that elicits sympathy and concern from the audience and I believe she achieved that goal. I wish the script would have allowed Christine's love interest, Justin Long, to broaden his role beyond that of concerned, protective  boyfriend. Unfortunately his character was only there to observe helplessly as the series of diabolical events unfolded.

To be honest I have mixed feelings about 'Drag Me To Hell' which leaves me hovering between a 3 and 4 star rating. The film delivers the required amount of disgusting moments to cause one to look away and the suspense builds sufficiently. However on the other hand there are some slow spots and the predictability factor was rather high. I knew where it all was going long before it got there. Or maybe I'm just settling on a -3 1/2 Star- rating because I would have preferred a different ending. All and all worth a viewing, especially since Halloween's just around the corner.",1255478400,4,1376,4.978260869565218

Alison Lohman is a cute loan officer who has to foreclose on an old gypsy woman. WEll, that comes back to haunt her. I have to say, this is in the top 5 movies of 2009 so far. It received great reviews, including a 92% on RT, a B+ by critics on Yahoo and a B by users on Yahoo.

Does anyone compose an artful shot anymore? Where is the decent music? Where is the decent acting? Can someone please hire an unknown actor who will do a decent job and not look like some comedy sidekick from some other film? How is it that everyone has a HUGE cottage style house in films? Does anyone live in an apartment anymore? How about the overdone computer effects? I can see it's a computer effect and it stinks. Maybe no one has seen what I've seen, or watched what I've watched. maybe everyone thinks this is scary. Or perhaps it was supposed to be a comedy? Something to sit around a dorm while throwing hot dogs and pizza at the TV? A bank worker who turns down an extension on a loan and is then sentenced to go to.. drum roll... Hell? Is this meant to be a metaphor for the current bank problems in the US? For real? An eyeball in some barn cake? A black cat that hisses? A goat? A GOAT!? Come on people. A garden hose nose bleed? And no trip to the hospital? I hope everyone that made money off this films saves up big time. I see little work in your futures. I see a goat, a fly, an eyeball in your cake and a failed film career. This was B A D BAD! Go rent Rosemary's Baby. Go see some real horror with good actors, great score, great photography and a great ending.

It is also so painfully obvious that Hollywood is posting shill reviews here. There is NO WAY IN HELL that this many people like this film. If they are all REAL reviews by REAL people that are not shilling for the studios then drag me to hell!",1255478400,13,1894,4.21763085399449

What, when she was given yet another chance and failed to fix the problem she wanted another bit of help? The ending was predictible and I was saddened by that.  It is a good movie to rent, buying is another story.

3917519,4,B002EEOE34,"Drag Me To Hell must be the most corniest name of a horror film. Going into DMTH knowing nothing besides it's terrible name, and especially after seeing The Messangers, I was beginning to question if Sam Rami could be prevelant as a horror director. Well Sam, cook me some alphabet soup, because Im ready to eat my words. Drag Me To Hell is an excellent film.

 Horror and comedy seem to mix well as a musical Film Noir, but DMTH succeeds as a hybrid. Rami struck a perfect equalibrium of scariness and funniness, neither are shoved extensivly down your throat, but play off each other well. The comedy is truly funny, but corny on purpose, making DMTH very satirical on the modern horror gore films. Tension is briliantly built up to make you laugh, but surprises you with a genuine scare. Though sometimes over excessive with blood, but Rami creates legitament and origonal scares. Think of it like boxing, it will jab at you with the comedy at first and when you let your guard down to laugh, you get KO'ed by the horror.

 DMTH takes the horror genre out of the lull it's been trapped in for years, and revives it into glory. Very stylized and over the top, the satire Rami creates helps as much as it hinders. Constantly, the actors blatently poke fun at the poor acting talents in other scary films, but in turn, it makes DMTH corny in the process. This double-edged sword had me rolling my eyes more than once at this otherwise fantastic flim.

3917520,4,B002EEOE34,"Sam Raimi has been sorely missed in the horror genre.  There have been quite a few EVIL DEAD immitators, but no one's ever approached the greatness his patented blend of horror, gross-out gags, and laughter.

DRAG ME TO HELL doesn't even come close to EVIL DEAD's pinnacle of horror and high jinks, but that probably doesn't surprise anyone.  What HELL is, however, is a delightful horror romp, a film that is unabashedly proud of its horror roots--it revels in the gore, in the jump-from-your-seat scares.  Alison Lohman plays Christine Brown, a bank clerk eying that big promotion.  The only thing standing in her way is her boss's lack of trust in her; she's too nice, doesn't take enough risks.  So she decides not to grant an old gypsy lady (Lorna Raver) another extension, and is subsequently cursed.  Her boyfriend (Justin Long) is supportive, but he doesn't believe in curses, and Christine must seek help from a fortune teller (Dileep Rao).

From there it's a scare-a-minute ride.  Basically, DRAG ME TO HELL is a low-budget horror movie given the big studio, big budget treatment; the special effects are astounding, but the story isn't diluted, as most big studio-produced horror movies are these days.  Sam and Ivan Raimi keep their horror tale pure, scary, and oddly hilarious, leading up to an ending you can see coming a mile away, but is still absolutely satisfying nonetheless.  DRAG ME TO HELL is a must see for horror fans, and is a welcome return from one of horror's masters.",1255392000,2,1496,4.850393700787402

Sorry I doubted you, Mr. Raimi.  To think I almost didn't go see ""Drag Me to Hell"" in the theater.  PG-13 typically spells ""kiddie horror"", but the man made it work. Spectacularly.  I never once felt that this film pulled a single punch.  It not only shows you the good/bad stuff, it vomits it on the floor in front of you and forces you to laugh at it.  This is overall the best reviewed horror film in recent memory and in this man's opinion Raimi has again served every other horror director  out there nearly 30 years after ""Evil Dead"" dropped. Applause is called for.

Let me get to what those of us who saw it in the theater want to know first.  How is the unrated director's cut?  Well, it's exactly the same film. However, there are a few shots where extra gore was added that apparently would have pushed an already intense horror film into R-rated territory so they were left out of the theatrical cut.  I welcome the additions, but I do wish there was more material to justify the ""unrated director's cut"" label, which implies something more substantial even beyond an R-rating.  And while I'm on about the DVD, the special features consist solely of about 30 minutes of excellent production diaries.  I wanted more.  A commentary with Raimi and the stars would have been great considering the director's talent for entertaining commentary tracks and the great personalities of the film's two charming stars Justin Long an Alison Lohman

The story and setup of ""Drag Me to Hell"" couldn't be any more standard or unimaginative.  Through a series of unfortunate events, a good person makes a bad decision under stress and winds up cursed by an old Gypsy woman.  An evil spirit will torment her for three days and then take her soul into the abyss unless she can find a way to stop or appease it.  Standard.  Unimaginative.  But I've often said that I don't mind the redundancy inherent in genre entertainment so long as the execution is solid; and it is beyond solid in this one.  Ms. Lohman is the loveliest thing I've seen on screen in some time.  As our protagonist, Christine, she is sweet and vulnerable but also prone to temperamental moments of badaz$ery, which come off as downright cute and funny no matter how mean-spirited her intent.  Raimi' sadism when it comes to his leads is legendary and Christine gets no quarter. Coping with stressful situations like meeting her boyfriend's terrifyingly shallow and judgmental mother or vying for a promotion at work against a ruthless amoral up-and-comer are bad enough without an evil spirit only you can see or hear blasting terrifying visions in your face without warning.  The film definitely uses the speakers to maximum effect which could be annoying in it's volume, but I feel that the film is trying to put you in Christine's shoes and makes you personally experience what is driving her insane, which is the flash-visions and screaming noise that accompany them.  Some may call them cheap ""startle scares"", but I feel it was for immersive purposes and I can tell you, it keeps you on edge.  Mission accomplished, then.

""Drag Me to Hell"" is not a comedy, but it is very funny.  The film is absolutely grim and you will see some deaths that will horrify you.  The scream of sheer terror that punctuates the opening scene is one I can't get out of my head.  Unlike most horror directors, Raimi doesn't care about morality.  He doesn't go into a film thinking he's going to punish the horny stoned teenagers and let the good-hearted innocents off with a warning.  Like I said, he's a sadist.  Regardless of how cute and nice and young a character is, they're getting it bad one way or another.  Empathy will get you nowhere.  It's all part of the fun.....if you're a sick bastard like me, that is.

The story goes from one messed-up situation to the next and Christine winds up seeking supernatural help to try and do away with her invisible demonic tormentor.  The film climaxes in what has got to be the wildest and most bizarre seance in cinema history.  That scene was where the film went from good fun to borderline classic for me.  I laughed hard even as I was completely shell-shocked by what I was seeing onscreen at the time.  It's relatively easy to be scary OR funny, but scary AND funny at the same time?  That takes a special kind of talent.  I have only one major complaint about ""Drag Me to Hell"" and it consists of a single bad CG shot.  Most of the effects are practical, and you will see in the production diaries that Lohman quite literally ate maggots to get a good shot.  What a trooper.  I told you Raimi's a beast.  Any way you slice it, this movie is the real deal and it pushed it's PG-13 rating as far as possible with disturbing death, vile excretions in unsavory place, and a generally sadistic attitude.  Even with a few extra-nasty shots, the core film is only slightly more shocking then it already was.  It's still the same movie.  No better, no worse.

""Drag Me to Hell"" has all of the familiar charm and zany unexpected bleak humor we've come to know from the director, and it's really amazing how comfortably he slipped right back into the horror genre.  In my opinion it can easily stand alongside the Evil Dead films in terms of sheer entertainment value and really could easily be seen as taking place in the same ""universe"" as it were.  Some may (and do) disagree but I would sentence those people to watch every inane toothless PG-13 horror film of the last two decades and then give this one another shot.  It'll look like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Exorcist/dp/B0000524CY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Exorcist</a>&nbsp;in comparison.  Good modern horror is hard to find on the big screen these days.  When we get it, let's embrace it with both arms, shall we?",1255392000,16,8010,5.727580372250423
3917523,2,B002EEOE34,"As a fan of Raimi films and the horror genre, I was rather disappointed by this predictable film. The ending was easily seen when the 2nd sealed envelope was created. The gypsy woman was not set up properly as a sympathetic character. In fact, the main character was more victim than the gypsy witch, and the 'romance' seemed tacked on and lacked believable chemistry between the 2 actors. There were many spots where FFWD is needed just to skip to some action. The graphics (in the action/attack scenes) were decent, and the diner scene at least had a true 'moral' element.

But this is best as a rental, not a full purchase. Or at least wait until a bargain bin sale. Especially given the paltry bonus features. I regret gambling the full DVD purchase price.",1255392000,4,760,4.62962962962963
3917524,5,B002EEOE34,"This is by far my favorite horror movie of the year. Sam Raimi simply knows how to frighten, make you laugh, gross you out, and leave you asking for more. There is simply not a dull moment in this rollercoaster ride of a movie. The plot, as you've read, revolves around a bank loan officer trying to get rid of a curse placed on her by a less than ecstatic gypsy customer. Raimi does a phenomenal job of building suspense and creating terrifying moments without revealing the entity, rather using lighting, sound, and camer work to dazzle the senses. Gore is really not necessary, though there are plenty of rather gross things finding their way into our would-be heroine's mouth. There are also classic over the top scenes that are well staged by Raimi that will remind most of the Evil Dead series (the seance scene would have been perfect for Bruce Campbell). Dark humor is present throughout, so do be prepared to laugh while awaiting the next fright. A must see for horror fans, and an excellent addition to any collection.",1255392000,2,1028,4.653846153846154

One thing I like is the lead Alison is a classy lady and doesn't have to try to look sexy like most of these girl's in horror flick's nowadays she has a real charm and likeability to her.
The story is pretty good and it could have gone very stocky and boring but the mix of comedy and horror is obviously what divided some people if you're a Raimi fan you will get it if not you will be kind of eh at firs as some people we're, I Had so much fun in the theatre as did my friend's and the other people in the theatre it's one to lay loud!

Even with lowered expectations, this flick disappointed on so many levels. Perhaps my insatiability for true horror is beyond hope, but to me this one really stunk.

Character development was decent at best. The talent was further lacking. I would say adequate acting. The story was simply old and tired. Cursed by a gypsy. Yes, thank you, but what about something... new? It trotted along like a handsome cab ride through a dirty city you've seen too often. Sure, you've got some classic Rami here. Nice camera work, interesting shots and direction. Sound editing was also nicely done. For those facts it gets 2 stars. Other than that, there is not much to see here aside from a couple nice gory scenes, all Raimi to a tee.

If you're a huge Raimi fan, of course you have to see it. But, I think my money and time were WAY better spent on Trick 'r Treat, a truly fun and outstanding horror flick with none of the listless tedium of being dragged through a boring 2 hour hell...

3917527,5,B002EEOE34,"After all the success he's had with the Spiderman movies, Rami has decided to return to his roots: freaky horror movies. Like Dario Argento and Tobe Hooper before him, Rami did amazing things with the horror genre with his Evil Dead series. What he did was combine gruesome horror with dark comedy. The end result was that Rami changed the genre forever. If you're going to make a horror these days, you had better have a sense of humor, too. Drag Me to Hell takes Rami back to his roots in a big and entertaining way. Allison Lohman plays a kind young woman who has to prove to her boss that she can make hard decisions. So, she denies a gypsy woman an extension on her mortgage. Enraged by the indignity, the gypsy casts a curse upon Lohman. What happens is three days of torture before she is dragged to Hell. What follows over those three days is a series of completely demented and darkly funny episodes. The entire cast is excellent as are the special effects, which take their cue from the bizarro effects from Evil Dead. This movie is destined to be a classic.",1255132800,4,1068,4.454081632653061

3917530,3,B002EEOE34,"Okay, it's Sam Raimi, who made his name with the Evil Dead but has recently been in blockbuster land with the Spider-Man films. So now he's delivering a small horror-comedy film that harks back to his old days. Great, let's go.

We open in California in 1978 or something. This concerned couple show up at this mansion and ask the medium who resides there to take a look at their little tyke, who does seem to be in a bad way. But before they can reach for the children's chewable aspirin, the floor cracks open and these wrinkly hands drag him to... can ya guess?

Now--present day! Our heroine Christine is at her job as a loan officer for some bank branch. She eyes the empty assistant manager desk hungrily, but her competition is smarmy Asian Stu, who is a little less ethical. Christine is told she has to make the tough decisions if she wants the job, so she denies the loan of this gross gypsy woman who has already missed two payments, hacks up yellow goo, needs a manicure, and steals all the desk candy. Well, wrong move. The woman shows up in Christine's car for an outrageously protracted battle royale, including a little touch where the old woman gets her dentures knocked out, and in place of a bite gives Christine a rather repulsive kiss.

So bad stuff starts happening to Christine at regular intervals, and she soon deduces that she has been cursed. True dat. She's going to endure three days of torment and then be dragged to Dayton, Ohio. Her torments are terribly brutal and often result in Christine getting bodily thrown across rooms. And then there's the visions, like the old woman puking up maggots right into Christine's open mouth. Like birds do.

But the gruesomeness is part of the comedy, and Raimi goes for the yuck factor with such gusto his enthusiasm becomes the humor. If there's something gross, it IS going in Christine's mouth. A preponderance of CGI during these moments diminishes their effect, and maybe that's for the best. When you're done watching the movie, remember: THAT was PG-13.

There are a number of other demented surprises, such as the talking goat, and the movie wheels around with such glee, the haunted house atmosphere is contagious. Also helping if the script's wicked sense of humor. For example, when told that an animal sacrifice might appease the demon who has his sights on her, Christine wails ""But I'm a vegetarian!"" Then, after a few more torments, that adorable kitten doesn't look that essential anymore. I'm going to keep this short to save most of the surprises for you.

That atmosphere is that of a Halloween haunted house, with something to jump out at you every few minutes. The only thing is, like a haunted house, its pleasures are fleeting. It'll tickle you and pass time like nobody's business, but that's about it. There's nothing to think about once it's over. Which, you know, has its place.

It's fun in a packed theater with screaming, laughing people, but will also hold up fine on video. It goes down smooth but leaves you with nothing to chew on. Now I need a sandwich!",1254268800,2,3059,4.664192949907235

3917532,5,B002EEOE34,"I'm a huge fan of horror movies. But unfortunately during the last 10 years or so, this genre has been plagued and eclipsed by 3 if it's own by-products. The first being The slasher genre, the second the torture genre and the last one the Japanese horror wannabe genre in which something horrible happened to somebody somewhere, then insert generic semi-hot start up actress here and link her to the cursed aforementioned person / place and you have an instant - just add water boring and predictable horror movie.

But just when I tought GOOD horror movies whith a good plot ala ""The Omen"" would never grace my home theater screen ever again, along comes this masterpiece with an ORIGINAL plot, great camera work and incredible direction. Justin long and his co-star do a great job and just when you think you have seen everything and you can predict the ending of any horror movie nowadays, this one throws you an unexpected twist at the end that you were not expecting and leaves you speechless. Yes, there's blood, yes, there's gore, (we all love that) but it's justified. And it happens in the perfect moments. There something bigger holding everything together. A solid plot where things happen for a reason and you see the characters evolve and being pushed to do things they never though they would do in the first place. That's what makes a good movie.

I enjoyed every single minute of this movie and it kept me on the edge of my seat which is something horror movies have been failing to do for a long time.

3917534,5,B002EEOE34,"I have to admit that the Evil Dead movies are 2 of my favorite horror movies of all time.  I loved Army of Darkness, but I guess it's debatable if that is even a horror movie.  Anyway, I was at the theater opening weekend to see Drag Me to Hell and was not disappointed.  It has Raimi written all over it with the screechy violin type music, the close up shots, and all the cool little camera tricks.  I was laughing and jumping throughout the whole movie and left the theater with a smile on my face.

The plot is pretty simple.  Alison Lohman plays Christine who works as a loan officer at a bank and is competing with a co-worker for an assistant manager position.  She has been at the bank far longer than this person, but has a difficult time making tough decisions.  So when Mrs. Ganush, an old Gypsy lady with one bad eye, false teeth and generally bad hygiene, walks in one day for an extension on her house payment Christine, trying to impress her boss, decides that the bank cannot extend the loan any further.  This ends in Mrs. Ganush begging Christine and causing a scene in the bank.  A confrontation between the two later leads to Mrs. Ganush putting the curse of the Llamia on Christine.  This curse basically means Christine is going to be haunted by a demon goat from hell until, on the third day, she is literally dragged to hell.

The sound and camera work in this movie was awesome.  Make sure you are watching this somewhere with a good surround sound system.  The effects are generally good, there are only a couple of things I can think of that were a little cheesy, but it fits in with movie.  Expect the same dark humor from the Evil Dead films which is a good thing.  I think Raimi really understands what having fun while watching a horror movie is all about.  After all the crappy remakes we seem to get in America, Drag Me to Hell was a much needed breath of fresh air for horror fans.  Don't miss it!",1252540800,14,1931,4.3314763231197775

Is there something wrong with me? (well daah!)
I have honestly believe that going to a theater to see a movie is a lovely experience. I don't know if it is because you can get toghether a share something with your friends and a whole bunch of strangers or because I just like to see big faces on a huge white wall.
Taking that into consideration, I honestly have to say that this flick must be seen at a dark Movie theater with a great sound system and bunch of friends.
The expresions on the audience are worth the ticket alone!
You are going say ""yuck"", you are going to get scared (with those hunted house kind of great innocent scares) and you are going to laugh (with that nervous laugh you get when you get a joke that put you on a spot for a moment)... What more do you want in your enterteniment? (I would have loved a little more sexyness, but that is about it).
The plot is simple: a girl is cursed by an horrid old hag so she has three days to get rid of the curse or she will be draged to hell (get it? DRAG ME TO HELL?)
I like the performances of all the actors, but I think the lead was simply impressive... If I were a film director I would kill for someone capable of taking so much punishment (via artificial bodly fluids) while giving a more than believeble performance.
Besides... I would marry her immediatly, but thats another story.

""Drag Me To Hell"" probes the shock/morbid/humor/morality/horror axioms as experienced in the earliest John Carpenter, Toby Hooper, etc. flicks (and OF COURSE Sam Raimi's Evil Dead trilogy). Allison Lohman plays the lead protaganista perfectly...portraying innocence (initially) and [...]-kicking resolve (later)....but the REAL ""horror-medal-of-honor"" is awarded to Lorna Raver for her potrayal as the ""disgraced"" gypsy Sylvia Ganush. Ganush is (quite possibly) the most horrific and digustingly memorable character in recent scare cinema history. Raimi's directorial savvy prevents this flick from being a formulaic ""Hollywood Slasher"" and instead inverts/converts it into a ""fun house"" on greased wheels....a run-a-way carnival ride after ""one too many"" funnel cakes....a ""log rolling contest"" on the surface of a lake of gelatinous bile.....a grade-school ""hold your breath"" stand-off in the midst of an overwhelming cloud of zombie farts during a prom night of the living undead........you get the idea. AND....hiding just beneath the strangely colored flying goo and hideously hilarious shrieks lies a ""good old fashioned morality tale"" (and the resulting consequences of one's choices). A classic!!

3917540,5,B002EEOE34,"Sam Raimi is back!  The director who gave us Evil Dead, Evil Dead 2, and Army of Darkness returns to the comic horror genre after a 17 year hiatus.  And his latest masterpiece, DRAG ME TO HELL, is destined to be another cult classic.

DRAG ME TO HELL is the simple story of Christine Brown.  Christine seems to have it all:  a boy friend who loves her and the inside track for promotion at work.  But to secure her promotion, she is forced to make a tough decision and evict an elderly gypsy woman from her house.  The gypsy woman puts an evil curse Christine, and now she has only three days undo the curse before she is dragged into Hell for all eternity.

As with his previous comic horror films, Sam Raimi successfully combines the jump-out-of-your-seat-BOO-factor with a corny story and cheesy special effects.  DRAG ME TO HELL is fun, especially when you realize what you are most afraid of is a lady's lace handkerchief!  Completely tongue-in-check, DRAG ME TO HELL will keep your heart racing and the laughter flying, both at the same time.

One of the nice things about DRAG ME TO HELL is that it is rated PG-13: there is no gore, no real blood (oh, there is some, but it is so clearly over the top and fake), no real violence, and I am not sure there is even any bad language.  There is an ick factor, but the rest is all up to the viewer's imagination, and as always, Sam Raimi helps us put our imaginations to good use.  If you like fun-filled, silly horror films, or if you have never seen a Sam Raimi film, DRAG ME TO HELL is an excellent choice.",1251763200,2,1560,4.337931034482758

Well, DRAG ME TO HELL is not his masterpiece... BUT it is a great film packed with all the elements we love to see in a horror movie directed by a master.

Attempting to show some toughness to her boss (the kind of toughness that will give her a promotion), Christine evicts an old Gypsy woman from her house. But the old woman throws a curse over Christine: in three days, a demon will come and drag her to hell. So there she is: desperate to reverse the curse before the third day comes... something that will not be an easy task.

But that's just the beginning of a great film. Here are all the elements that make this film a sure bet if you want to have lots of fun (Sam Raimi's style, naturally):

STORY - everything here clicks. Nothing is left outside and all is wonderfully told.

SCREENPLAY and SET PIECES - being the showman that he is, all the scary moments are constructed for the biggest effect... like the seance scene with the goat. Everything is written in a way that it turns out to be different than what we expect... and the results are beautiful.

LAUGHS and HORROR - yes, the blending of both elements is flawless.

CASTING - all actors are top notch AND all characters are quite interesting. You really feel empathy for the protagonist.

EFFECTS and MAKEUP - awesome! There are many moments where I went ""yuk!"" and in a horror film like this, this is a big plus.

So this film is the proof that the Horror genre is alive and kicking... and I hope many other masters will soon return to this genre with projects as carefully developed like this (are you reading this, John Carpenter?). This is clearly a labor of love from Sam Raimi and an extraordinary gift for all horror fans.

I thought this Sam Raimi gem would get mixed reviews at best, so I was blown away when I saw the 100 or so positive reviews flowing in from critics. It ranks with UP and Star Trek as one of the best reviewed movies of the year. That rarely happens with a horror film, but this one is so much more. It's full of dark humor, gross out gags (really pushes the PG-13 envelope), good acting, nice SFX and an interesting story. I can't remember the last time I was this surprised at how much better the movie was than any of the trailers or what I had expected going in.

Alison Lohman really sold me here. She is very cute, but she shows the smarts and toughness you almost never see in a horror flick. Really good stuff from her. The whole cast from Justin Long to the evil gypsy lady is spot on and you can't leave out director Sam Raimi. His visual style here will remind you of The Evil Dead trilogy, but with a bigger budget and just as much creativeness. It was great to see this now summer blockbuster director go back to his roots and knock it out of the park. The music and sound effects are some of the best I've heard in a long time. When it goes from quiet to extremely loud, the sound alone will make you jump. Out of all the movies I have seen in theaters, I can't remember one with sound mixing this good.

Yes, Sam Raimi, back from his Evil Dead, Evil Dead II, and Army of Darkness days returns to his own genre of cult horror-comedies in this film.  An earnest young lady bucking for a promotion as Assistant Bank Manager tries to show her mettle by denying a mortgage extension to an elderly gypsy woman.

What could possibly go wrong?!?  In a Sam Raimi horror film, plenty, including a long fight scene between the girl and the old lady which will have you squirming in disgust and laughing at the same time.  Very soon, she is confronted by a curse of the Lamia which will soon Drag Her To Hell and she must find a way to outwit and circumvent her curse.

Allison Lohman and Justin Long play their parts pretty well with some laugh-out loud moments at a psychic parlor, especially with the out-of-focus but clearly disbelieving Justing Long in the background.  And, not to spoil the film too much, but who ever would have thought that ""Here, kitty, kitty, kitty"" would become the funniest line of the year in a summer-time flick?

In retaliation, Ganush places a curse on Christine which, if not passed on to someone else within three days, will plunge her into the depths of Hell to burn for eternity.

 There are some crazy moments as Christine has to come to grips with whats happening to her. Justin Long plays the boyfriend who tries to understand but arrives to the party a bit late. Raver is the big save as the disgusting, & revolting Ganush & there are a few set pieces that really work.

The movie combines the most gruesome elements from The Exorcist, Poltergeist, The Changeling, and other classic horror movies; however, despite the PG-13 rating the action and gore is very explicit and never toned down.  The movie score is mysterious and intense with hints of Gothic era music and industrial sounds like the creaking of a rusted gate.  The score does a great job of adding creepiness to the already creepy and intense plot.

The movie starts off with a bang with an intense scene involving the attack of a demonic ghost.  The plot is unique and dramatic enough to keep the movie going the entire time without it becoming too boring.  The plot only becomes slightly redundant and overwhelming at the middle point.  A few of the scenes could have done without the comic twists and cheesy effects that reminded me of Haunted Mansion featuring Eddie Murphy.  The ending was a bit weak and could have been more extreme; however, the rest of the movie made up for that because there is blood squirting, vomiting, ghost, demon, and witch stalking, nightmares, seances, corpse action at a funeral, grave digging, eyes popping out, and research completed into the realm of black magic that will leave you jumping in your seat, or holding your breath.

3917552,4,B002EEOE34,"Sam Raimi made the right decision by not using ""Drag Me to Hell"" as an opportunity to transcend its genre. This is a classic-style horror movie, one that's not only aware of its clich&eacute;s but also makes it a point to have fun with them. It's a thrill-a-minute story of gypsy curses and evil spirits, menacing shadows and unexplained gusts of wind, disgusting makeup effects and moments that make you jump, sudden noises and squeaky gates, old houses and creepy cemeteries that can only be desecrated in the middle of a rainstorm. It was undoubtedly made with the intention of producing both shrieks and giggles. Having been attached to the ""Spider-Man"" trilogy for the past seven years, Raimi returns to the genre that made him famous and genuinely seems to be enjoying himself in the process.

At the heart of this story is Allison Lohman, who brings such great naivety and enthusiasm to a role that doesn't require anything other than screaming helplessly while looking pretty. She plays Christine Brown, a young Los Angeles loan officer who has her eye on a vacant managerial position. Trying to prove herself capable of making tough decisions, she refuses to extend a loan on a house owned by an old Eastern European woman named Sylvia Ganush (Lorna Raver). Sporting a bad eye and a thick accent that fans of Maria Ouspenskaya would recognize, the elderly gypsy violently places a curse on Christine in a parking garage, enraged over having been shamed in public. Later on, Christine seeks spiritual guidance from a psychic named Rham Jas (Dileep Rao) and learns that she's being stalked by a demon that will claim her soul in three days.

There to support Christine is her boyfriend, Dr. Clay Dalton (Justin Long), who believes in the rational more than the mystical. Little does he realize what Christine is going through; her life is now plagued with horrific visions and destructive supernatural events, and what's worse, no one else can see or hear them occurring. She appeals to Ms. Ganush's family, only to be matter-of-factly told, ""You deserve everything you have coming to you."" And no wonder--when Ms. Ganush first curses her, she ominously tells her, ""Soon, it will be you who comes begging to me."" Is there any way at all to reverse the curse? Rham Jas thinks there may be. Here enters Shaun San Dena (Adriana Barraza), who had a very personal encounter with Christine's demon forty years ago. She lives in a sprawling mansion in Pasadena and holds s&eacute;ances in a vast chamber that rivals the decorative opulence of Hill House (as reinterpreted by Jan de Bont).

Horror fans will not be disappointed with this film. Raimi makes sure to give them a little bit of everything, including a few well-placed moments of humor. You'll note that I said horror fans. It probably won't appeal to the slasher crowd, which is just as well since slashers are more about sex, nudity, and dead teenagers than they are about scares. ""Drag Me to Hell"" is clearly more interested in genuine, primal fright, relying more on the things that go bump in the night than on elaborate murder scenes with masked killers. Even during the funnier moments, each laugh seemed lovingly put into place, as if to underscore the fact that what you're watching can't be taken seriously. Raimi has always been fairly good at balancing horror and humor, and it's nice to see that the years of more family friendly fare have done nothing to diminish that.

But this movie works for reasons other than its story. Christopher Young's score is brooding, gothic, and melodramatic, a wonderfully theatrical counterpart to the horrific visuals. It effectively evokes the themes that go with being cursed by a gypsy. Steve Saklad's production design nicely combines smaller, more intimate spaces with grandiose settings. Peter Deming's cinematography is probably the most important creative aspect of all, seeing as lighting is everything in a horror film. Nowhere is it put to better use than in a scene late in the film, one in which Christine digs up a grave in the rain. Thunder continuously pierces the air while lightning gives just the right amount of illumination.

And as for the makeup effects, all I can say is be prepared to do a lot of cringing. It's not so much that they're gory (although there is scene that takes a nosebleed to the nth degree), but they definitely aren't shy about being revolting. I could describe them for you, but you'd probably be better off getting disgusted on your own. All in all, ""Drag Me to Hell"" is quite an effective horror movie, slick and stylish, funny and frightening, ghoulish and gruesome. With something this well crafted, however, I find it interesting that Raimi didn't go for broke and cast Bruce Campbell, his frequent collaborator and star of the highly popular ""Evil Dead"" films. Would that have been too much of a throwback? Maybe, but considering how successfully the two have worked together, it still gets me to wonder.",1247788800,,4963,4.875592417061611

3917554,5,B002EEOE34,"He's back! No I'm not talking about Freddy, Jason, Chucky or Michael. I'm talking about Sam...as in Sam Raimi. It's been almost 17 years since Raimi has helmed a horror flick and he hasn't lost his touch. Drag Me to Hell feels like the ugly (real ugly), long lost sister of Evil Dead II. It blends jump-outta-your-seat scares with Three Stooges style slap stick. If that sounds like an odd combination then you've never watched a Raimi horror movie before...

Drag Me to Hell is a basic morality tale. The whole thing feels like a polished episode of Tales from the Crypt. The story follows Christine Brown (Alison Lohman), a young woman who is looking to move up the corporate ladder at the bank where she's employed. Her boss tells her that she must learn to make the hard decisions if she wants a promotion and the first time she attempts this she forecloses the house of a disgusting, old, gypsy woman (Lorna Raver). If classic horror has taught us anything it's that you don't EVER screw with gypsies (or carnie folk). The dilapidated crone waits for Christine in the parking garage (in Raimi's beat up Oldsmobile!) and applies the 'Curse of Lamia'. The Lamia is a devil goat that loves the taste of souls. It takes three days to fully manifest and then the demon comes looking for its meal which gets dragged back to Hell for consumption.

Christine is perfectly portrayed by Lohman and I'll be damned if that girl doesn't have some spunk! She is cute as hell and has a knack for physical comedy. One thing about Raimi is that he loves to put his actors/actresses through the ringer. Lohman is a trooper as she gets hit in the face with maggots, mud, blood, drool etc... See that's the beauty of this film. Every time something terrifying happens it's quickly followed up with some disgusting gag that makes you cringe and then burst into a fit of laughter. It's a really great group experience...much like a well executed haunted house.

Justin Long plays Lohman's love interest, Dr. Clay Dalton, and to be honest it seems like he's just along for the ride. Make no mistake about it, this is Lohman's movie and she easily carries it all on her own. The rest of the cast is merely there to witness Christine physically and mentally fall apart as the Lamia's curse intensifies.

My only real complaint is that Raimi actually had the budget to create some CG effects. While they don't ruin the movie, I would have loved to see him stick with the real stuff instead. My main problem is that the things he uses CG for could have easily been done with practical effects.

Drag Me to Hell is horror done right. Sam Raimi has crafted one of the best horror films I've seen in the past 5 years. You've got elements of Evil Dead, The Exorcist and Dead Alive all stirred into the wicked witch's brew that is Drag Me to Hell. The packed theatre I sat in seemed to really get into it, but I'm afraid some folks simply won't wrap their heads around all the goofy stuff that Raimi does. Make sure you drag as many friends as possible to see it. Rest assured that everyone will be jumping in their seats, covering their eyes, screaming and giggling like prepubescent schoolgirls! Drag Me to Hell is just flat out fun cinema. Go see it.

3917555,5,B002EEOE34,"I giggled throughout this movie, in between the jump scares and genuine moments of spine-tingling creepiness.  It is the perfect combination of horror and humor.

There's plenty of gore and plenty of startles, but unlike most horror films, Drag Me to Hell doesn't rely solely on either trick to unsettle the audience.  There are many chilling and suspenseful moments that create a perfect sense of dread. And the whole gypsy angle is executed to hair-raising perfection.

But there's also a sense of giddy and gleeful mischief on the part of both the demon in the film and Sam Raimi himself, as though he's playing an elaborate prank on his protagonist and we're in on the joke.  The Lamia clearly comes from the same (or similar) loony-toon version of Hell that the ""deadites"" come from in the ""Evil Dead"" series.

Is it scary?  Hell yes.  But it's also really funny, in the twisted sort of way that any fan of Sam Raimi's earlier work (or Tim Burton's for that matter) will appreciate.",1246838400,,987,4.730994152046784

3917559,4,B002EEOE34,"Drag Me to Hell (Sam Raimi, 2009)

On behalf of the horror community, I would like to thank Sam Raimi for cutting it out with the superhero crap and getting back to what he does best--fast, funny, genuinely scary little movies that get both the critics and the public into a frenzy. While it has, hands down, the worst title of any movie released so far this year, Drag Me to Hell has all the horror movie chops you could ask for and then some.

Drag Me to Hell is the story of Christine Brown (White Oleander's Alison Lohman), a loan officer at a bank who's up for an Assistant Manager position. Also competing is Stu Rubin (Tropic Thunder's Reggie Lee), who is the underhanded, sneaky counterpart to Christine's forthright, farm-girl naivete. Their boss (the wonderful David Paymer, recently of Ocean's Thirteen) counsels Christine that in order to be assistant manager material, she needs to make the tough decisions, so when an infirm woman named Sylvia Ganush (TV actress Lorna Raver in her first big-screen appearance since 2003's First Watch) comes looking for another extension on her home loan thanks to mounting medical bills, it's Christine who makes the decision to turn her down. This causes something of a fracas, and ends with Ganush having to be removed from the building by security. All seems well, and Christine is ready to put the incident behind her, until the end of the day, when Ganush is waiting for her with a taste for vengeance--and a terrible curse.

If you think about this godawful title, and you know your obscure horror-flick history, you'll probably make the leap to such low-budget fare as I Drink Your Blood and the like, staples of the midnight show at drive-in theaters. And Raimi obviously meant Drag Me to Hell as an homage to those horrendous old movies, which he probably has the same affection for that so many of us horror fans do. The difference is that Raimi is a master filmmaker, where the directors of those movies were, in the main, hacks looking to make a quick buck. Raimi takes, and uses, the standard conventions of the horror genre, but he knows how to twist those conventions around in order to make any given scene horrifying or humorous (or, in some cases, both; the ruler scene will hit you right between the eyes) despite all of us having seen all of this stuff before. He plays with timing, with lighting, with scene, and it all works tremendously.

Also, another way in which Raimi has honed his craft since the Evil Dead days is that in the original Evil Dead, the horror and the humor were separate components; the first half-hour has become a textbook in how to create tension in a horror film, and then the film goes straight into Three Stooges territory. Raimi has learned how to blend here, and oh, it works so very well.

The genius of the film is, quite simply, that it's effective. Rather than trying to do something wholly original, which is pretty tough to do in the horror genre these days, Raimi took well-trod ground and made it fresh and interesting. I'm actually surprised this came out of Hollywood, with its recent glut of pale remakes and even paler sequels. One of the best American big-screen horror films in years. ****",1246233600,,3203,4.682060390763765

Don't they know that's the American way now?

ANYWAY, ""Drag Me to Hell"" is just a solid horror movie, almost an extended version a Tales From the Cript episode. Like horror and like Sam Raimi, you'll like ""Drag Me to Hell"". I'm not a huge Raimi fan probably because of the Spider-Man movies, which I was not impressed by at all. The Evil Dead series is classic and ""Drag Me to Hell"" shows that Raimi still has the touch even after years making, imo, uninteresting comic book flick movies. If gypsies creep you out (like they do me) be warned now this is about as gypsy-creepy as it gets. Also, there is a demon that likes to scare people by being really loud: if the sound is turned up in the theater your going to loose some cilia cells. 3.8 stars.",1246147200,,1126,4.4396135265700485

The film is scary, gross, and funny.  The PG-13 rating, normally the mark of a crap horror movie, works perfectly.  In fact, it is about as close to an R rating a film can get.

At first glance, the setup is pretty silly.  But it may very well be a sly jab at the recent corrupt mismanagement of financial markets that led to the housing bust.
An old gypsy lady puts a curse on Christine, the woman who denies her a further extension on a home loan.  One should never disrespect their elders, and now all hell's about to break loose.

Okay, I didn't immediately buy into this ""old lady stalking the young gal"" premise.  It seemed pretty ridiculous.  But before long you will catch Raimi's intent, and you can't help but give in to the lunacy.  It's mind-boggling!  Blood, guts, demons, and wacky-wild sadistic humor that will leave you horrified and cackling with laughter.

3917564,5,B002EEOE34,"I was never a huge fan of Sam Raimi. I hadn't really seen anything of his besides the Spiderman movies and The Gift...all, of which, I enjoyed. So, I wasn't too familiar with his ""horror movie roots"". I was pleasantly surprised. I remember seeing the poster for this at a theatre months before it came out. I'd never heard of it and I'd heard no hype at all. I thought it looked interesting so I watched the trailer and I got SO excited to see it!

The movie revolves around Christine, a bright, young woman who has a pretty nice life consisting of a great job as a loan officer, great boyfriend and all the potential in the world. An opportunity for a promotion is what causes Christine to refuse a loan extension to the very creepy and quite vile Mrs. Ganush...and this causes Mrs. Ganush to seek revenge on Christine by placing a curse on her. Christine has 3 days to figure out a way to rid herself of said curse before she is...of course...dragged into hell.

I've read SO many people saying that this movie didn't do too well because of it's rating, it's release date and it's lack of star power. I have to agree with the release date. I personally think it would have done better had it been released closer to Halloween. The PG-13 rating excuse is COMPLETE nonsense because there are several good horror films out there that are rated PG-13...this one doesn't even feel PG-13. I think the fact that people won't go see it simply because of the rating is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. All of you people just stick to your mindless, stupid and poorly made ""remakes"". You're missing out.

The difference in this movie and the several ""horror"" movies and remakes as of late is...this movie is actually GOOD. Its highly entertaining on many levels. It's scary, not only with the imagery but with the well done ""jump out"" scares. Its also very funny. I've never been a fan of horror comedies, the only other one I like is the underrated Slither. Both rely A LOT on gross out tactics as well. It can get pretty sick. This one just works on so many levels. I think its pure genius and quite original.

As far as people saying the acting in the movie was bad...I think its supposed to be. This is a silly, over the top movie and the actors did exactly what they were supposed to. The over-acted, ridiculous work of the actors was perfect and, I think, just what Raimi wanted out of them. It wouldn't have worked otherwise. I thought everyone did a great job.

Overall, I've seen it twice in theatres. The first time I completely fell in love with it and had a blast, I was SO excited to see it again. The second time was with a HUGE audience and I had more fun in a movie than I have in a very long time. I definitely recommend seeing it with an audience or a large group of friends. SO much fun.

You can bet on the fact that, if Raimi makes more like this, I'll be first in line.",1245110400,,2893,4.348148148148148
3917565,3,B002EEOE34,"After being disturbed by Evil Dead and delighted by Evil Dead II, I decided to host a showing of the two movies to share the madness with my friends. We then all went to the opening of Army of Darkness.  We were confused (the three films vary widely in tone) but ultimately loved them all, adopting the Raimi clan and The Man, Bruce Campbell, as one of our own in geekdom.

Ever since then, Raimi's fans have been waiting for him to return to his horror roots. Oh, we've gotten hints that he hasn't forgotten us through the years. We caught the Evil Dead II homage in the chainsaw sequence from Spider-Man. Campbell is in just about every movie Raimi produces.  And the Oldsmobile Delta 88 makes an appearance in Drag Me to Hell - a big appearance, actually - as it has in every Raimi movie since Evil Dead.  The Oldsmobile's arrival signals that Drag Me to Hell is a quintessential Raimi horror film.

Drag Me to Hell harkens back to the golden age of 80s horror, an era Raimi helped spawn, when humor and horror were inextricably mixed thanks to Freddy Krueger's perpetual joke-machine. Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) is a cute blonde loan officer in five-inch heels working at a bank - any social commentary is surely accidental (wink, wink, nudge, nudge) - and when she turns down an old gypsy woman (Lorna Raver), things go horribly and hilariously wrong.

Raimi has always been a master of scaring you with things you can't see.  He knows how to use sound to freak out the audience, employing the same shrieks and creaks he used in Evil Dead II to represent something from another dimension crossing into our world. Raimi also knows when to use silence as a tool, which just ratchets up the tension - this is the first film where I could hear the movie projector clicking away in the background. He manipulates billowing curtains and floating handkerchiefs with the methodical calculation of a Universal horror theme park, shrieking ""BOO!"" when the tension is at its height.

Raimi expertly manipulates the audience's affection for Christine.  On the surface she's an adorable girl from the country just trying to be accepted by her big city boyfriend's parents.  But as we get to know her, Christine comes off as a mewling brat more concerned about her appearance while poor people like Mrs. Ganush are being thrown out on the street. There's a turning point mid-way through the film where Christine crosses the line from being merely pathetic to reprehensible, and from there on out cat-lovers may well begin cheering her demise (I know I was!).

The similarities between Drag Me to Hell and Evil Dead II are striking (SPOILER ALERT!): an unwitting protagonist is cursed; an evil hag attacks; his friends become demonically possessed, flying around the room cackling and dancing like marionettes; the evil ""gets inside him"" causing him to vomit a huge amount of nasty stuff; there's a fight in a tool shed; eyes show up in weird places; eyeballs fly into somebody's mouth; even the twist ending is similar.

I didn't love this film, though I desperately wanted to.  It's probably because I'm not the target audience - Drag Me to Hell is a PG-13 film and although its scares are suitably disgusting, they aren't nearly as gory as other horror movies. In other words, it's perfect for teenagers out on a date.  For jaded horror fans like myself, we've seen it all before. The only thing missing is The Man himself.",1245024000,2,3421,4.727731092436975

Drag Me To Hell reminded me of too many other movies, such as those listed above.

I am rating it about average.  I could take it or leave it.  I don't really think that I would consider it a true horror film though, as I was laughing more than anything.  It just got too hokey.

The seance/possession scene was priceless.  I'm glad I wasn't drinking anything when the goat became possessed.  I would have spit it out in laughter.  The possessed Mexican dude, with the teeth like the clown in IT, or Karen Black's teeth in the Trilogy of Terror (Amelia sketch), was also truly priceless.  If I didn't know better, I would say he looked like a puppet on strings.

The movie did have decent special effects at times.  The fly up the nose and in the mouth was good.  The vanishing apparitions were good in the seance scene.  The final scene was also good.  The demon shadow scenes were also done well in my opinion.

If you are into goo and grossness in various places, then this movie might be for you.  Yet another hilarious sketch though was near the beginning when the old gypsy woman lost her dentures and was gumming Alison Lohman in the car.  This was just too reminiscent of that old SNL sketch with Mr. Peepers (the half-man, half-monkey, played by Chris Kattan).  Very funny stuff.

Justin Long's acting was pretty much one speed.  Except for the very end, I didn't see any emotion whatsoever from him.  Sort of like his Apple commercials.  In any event, I thought he was much better in Live Free or Die Hard.

I did think that Alison Lohman did a fine job in her lead role.  I think that she was a little dry during the first part of the movie, but got more into her role near the end.

3917570,4,B002EEOE34,"With nearly every critic giving it a ""thumbs-up"" and the implication being that Sam Raimi shows all other directors ""how it's done,"" I went into DRAG ME TO HELL with my expectations set pretty high.  I love a good horror film that can scare me, or at least give me a good case of the willies.  Not too many succeed...as we all know.

Early on, I had to reset my expectations, because what Sam Raimi has done with this film is take a much more ""old-fashioned"" approach.  He doesn't reinvent the horror film, far from it.  He just goes back to the basics in many ways.  He relies on ""gotcha"" moments and ""gross out"" moments in equal measure, but he also remembered to give us a heroine we could genuinely root for and he also gives us supernatural moments that actually make sense to the story.

Raimi has crafted a movie that in some ways feels like a TV-movie combination of a TALES FROM THE CRYPTKEEPER combined with the combined with the aesthetics of a XENA episode (created and produced by Raimi).  It frequently features some pretty low-rent special effects...but it's a credit to his skills as a craftsperson that this seldom detracts from the sheer story-telling fun.  We simply WANT to see what happens next and have a great time.  As I think back, this was accomplished by an outstanding combination of genuine scares with genuine humor.  There's no sly, winking at the camera kind of humor (such as the SCREAM movies had).  It's the humor that recognizes that there is something FUNNY and something SCARY at the same time in having an ancient Gypsy woman attack the heroine in her car and vomit on her face.  Does that sound icky?  Yep, it is!  Does it also sound like something more appropriate to an AMERICAN PIE film?  Yep, it gloriously is that as well.

DRAG ME TO HELL tells the story of a young loan officer at a small bank (Alison Lohman, who apparently will never look any older than 17) who is vying for a promotion with a much more cold-blooded, ruthless co-worker.  At the urging of her boss (David Paymer), she takes a tough stance with a very elderly, very unappealing old woman who has already missed several house payments and is clearly not in a position to suddenly produce more money.  Lohman declines the loan, against her softer instincts, and suddenly the crazy old woman with the gross dentures is on her knees pleading.  Lohman sticks to her guns, and as the woman is dragged from the facility, she curses Lohman.

Yep, turns out Lohman got herself on the bad side of a gypsy.  A gypsy  who has put a mega-curse on her, one that will involve her being tormented by supernatural events for three days, and then being unceremoniously dragged to hell for all eternity.

Lohman doesn't believe the woman is anything more than a nutcase at first, but when the old crone attacks Lohman (with surprising strength) in her car, she begins to get worried for her safety.  I should mention that this fight scene, which involves many gross body fluids, unsavory dentures and really filthy fingernails, is a DOOZY.  In many ways, it's the most purely exciting part of the film and watching it gave me the thrill of knowing, ""YES, this movie is going to be a funhouse ride!""

Lohman is given moral support by her boyfriend (Justin Long), but when things get supernatural, he doesn't believe her.  It takes the neighborhood psychic to help explain her predicament to her, and much of the movie involves Lohman trying to undo the curse, while trying to cope with ever more menacing events.  The film gives us a variety of supernatural happenings, but they all make sense within the substance of the curse she is under.  I am so tired of ""scary"" movies that just concoct a bunch of random ""gotcha"" moments that don't really get tied together...but are just thrown into the film to look cool, or show how inventive the director is.

At the center of the film is Lohman.  She's a fine actress (MATCHSTICK MEN, BIG FISH) who doesn't seem to get much work...probably because she still looks like a girl.  But she brings the right touch to this role.  She is supposed to be meek at first, but finds inner resources of strength.  (There's a GREAT scene where she meets Long's wealthy, disapproving parents, in which she calmly and intelligently asserts her worth...at least until all hell breaks loose.)  And she is also torn by moral dilemmas which are actually fairly compelling for a genre flick.  She has some choices about how to rid  herself of the curse that would not be easy for any moral person to make.  When she crossed the line on occasion, we get a malicious joy.  But when she pulls back, we feel for her difficult choices.

The film has a ""surprise"" ending that isn't really much of a surprise.  But again, Raimi seems to understand that we've all seen movies before, and won't really be surprised at WHAT happens...but he knows he can still thrill us with the HOW.

I want to give special mention to Lorna Raver, who plays Mrs. Ganush the gypsy.  It's a wildly over-the-top role, and Raver tears into with gusto.  Yet she also, surprisingly, finds some humanity in the woman in her early scenes...so that the switch to pure villainess is all the more astonishing.  The film would not work if Mrs. Ganush were merely a cardboard character...Raver makes sure she isn't.

The film is great fun...pure and simple.  It does have some failings, particularly in the lackluster performance of Justin Long, who doesn't seem to know what to do with a role in which he is not supposed to be funny.  He and Lohman don't really generate any real chemistry.  As I said, you also need to be able to laugh aside some cheesy effects.  And unfortunately, Raimi did not find a cameo for Bruce Campbell!

This film had not been on my radar at all prior to about one week before opening.  It falls into a summer jam-packed with huge mega-hits (including some quality movies like STAR TREK & UP)...but it begs to be seen with an audience, so please try to see it in the theaters if you can.  If not, watch the DVD with a group of friends, preferably with the lights out!",1244678400,2,6076,4.587198515769944
3917571,4,B002EEOE34,"Drag Me to Hell is truly a frightening movie, with just the right amount of special effects to comprise some truly gory scenes. An excellent cast and crew featuring Alison Lohman, Justin Long and Lorna Raver made the movie quite engaging. The details regarding the roles I will leave with the other reviewers, but I will nonetheless chip in on what one might pick up on after daring to take this particular ride. So here goes.

In comparison to other horror film releases, Drag Me to Hell is arguably the scariest PG-13 movie of all time. Sam Raimi, recently famous for his Spider-Man blockbusters, delved deeply into enhancing many a moviegoer's unnerving experiences. His ability to co-write and direct this brainchild no doubt makes him one of the hottest commodities in Tinseltown.

However, despite his apparently unique abilities, Raimi probably consulted with director, William Friedkin, regarding the production and direction of modern-day horrorfests, including this latest flick. In an interview, Friedkin recalled back in 1973 how he would demand that theater managers turn the volume up when showing his movie, The Exorcist, in order to provide and yet receive the full, audio-visual effects that were then attainable. And it is this mentality that seems predominant throughout Drag Me to Hell; even when the next scene is somewhat predictable, the delivery thereof is not.

As a word of warning, Drag Me to Hell is not for the faint of heart. Do not let the PG-13 fool you; I do not know what the MPAA was thinking! In terms of startling the viewer, this is way beyond The Sixth Sense and several a sixth sense. Though this is not putting this picture on a much lighter note, Drag Me to Hell lays it all on the line, leaving virtually nothing to the imagination in the aftermath. This is fortunate, for the viewer can walk out and leave the ninety-plus minutes of trepidation behind and not take home any lingering thoughts to make life seem more unsettling than it already is.

But Heaven forbid that Raimi, with an uncanny potential to add to the experience and yet remain true to the story, should do a twenty-first century version of The Exorcist!",1244419200,,2164,4.872282608695652
3917572,4,B002EEOE34,"I love a good scary film, the type that makes you sit on the edge of your seat for the duration of the movie. ""Halloween"", ""Psycho"", ""The Haunting"" are all great examples of horror films. The reason the best examples of this genre work is the filmmakers leave a lot of the scares to your imagination. They set the tone, create the environment, present the characters and set-up the situation for the scares. Once the story gets going, a lot of the scares happen off screen and we imagine what might have happened. When our minds do the work, the story becomes much more scary.

The current trend is to make horror films as graphic as possible. If someone isn't eviscerated every five minutes, the filmmaker seems to get restless and the audience doesn't seem to enjoy the experience as much. Personally, these new 'horror' films are merely excuses to show as much blood and guts as possible and they only make me ill, not scared. They aren't really horror films. Most aren't really films.

So I don't go to a lot of horror films these days.

But something about ""Drag Me To Hell"", the new film from director Sam Raimi (""The Evil Dead"", ""Spiderman""), gave me hope. First, it is rated PG-13, so it can't be completely gory or filled with gross out moments.

From the moment the first frames rolled, I began to feel that perhaps I guessed right. ""Drag Me To Hell"" would be a horror film I could stomach. Why so early? Raimi chose to use the Universal logo from the 70s, with the word Universal slowly fading in over the rotating globe. Anytime a filmmaker uses an older studio logo, they are usually indicating either the era the story is set in or the period of time the film would probably have been made. Spielberg used the old Paramount logo for each of the Indiana Jones films, clueing us in to the homage he pays to the time period. By using the older studio logo, Raimi is indicating to us that this film will be a little older fashioned, the scares will probably be a bit more visceral, less gross, less gory.

Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) seems to have everything a young girl could want; a promising career at a bank (she is vying for a promotion to Assistant Manager), a smart boyfriend, Clay Dalton (Justin Long), who happens to be a young psychology professor, and a house to call her own. But her boss, Mr. Jacks (David Paymer) tells her in no uncertain terms he is considering two people for the position, Stu Rubin (Reggie Lee), a new loan officer at the bank and her. What he wants in his new Assistant is someone who isn't afraid to make the hard decisions. Shortly after this talk, Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver), an old woman with a glass eye and a wicked cough, enters the bank and asks Christine for some help. She needs an extension on her home loan, or she will lose her house of 31 years. When Christine presents the situation to her boss, he tells her his feelings but states that it is her decision. She needs to make the hard choices. Christine refuses Mrs. Ganush's request and the old woman soon places a curse on Christine. That evening, Christine starts to see and hear strange noises and feel a presence in her house. She manages to convince Clay that she isn't just imagining things and they go to a seer, Rham Jas (Dileep Rao). After a few moments, he quickly offers to refund their money (never a good thing in a horror film) but Christine soon returns to him and he reveals she has been cursed and helps her navigate how to have the curse removed before the spirit returns to claim her soul and take her to hell. Rather ""Drag"" her ""To Hell"". Eventually, he says she must have an exorcism and introduces her to Shaun San Dena (Adrianna Barraza), a woman who conducts sances and, many years ago, had a fight with the very same spirit who inhabits Christine's body. They move quickly to extract the spirit.

Co-written by Sam Raimi and his brother Ivan, ""Drag Me"" is a fun horror film. A lot of the scares cause you to laugh because they are so silly, so over the top. ""Hell"" is actually a fun film to watch.

One thing that immediately struck me was that the film was very, very loud. Usually, this happens when the theater has the sound adjusted for a full house, to compensate for all of the chatter, movement, change dropping out of pockets, etc. The screening I attended was not full, so the music and soundtrack seemed really loud. I discounted it to this. But I soon realized that I think Raimi is playing with the sound throughout the film, using that as an element to scare us. Much like in ""The Haunting"", he seems to use the sound to make bangs and crashes all the more noticeable, frightening us with quick jolts of percussion. It is an interesting technique and it works to provide some chills and some jolts.

Alison Lohman (""Beowulf"", ""Matchstick Men"", ""White Oleander"") plays Christine and she initially appears to be your average career girl, working her way up the corporate ladder one step at a time. But Raimi pulls back the layers and shows us how complicated she is, using these other character traits against her as the scares mount. She isn't a bad person at all, so we feel for her when the old gypsy woman ultimately curses her, even though she could have prevented all of this by simply extending her loan. Everything we learn of Christine only makes her seem more human and because this is tied into the horror, her plight becomes more suspenseful.

Interestingly, Christine denies the woman an extension due to her own self interests and we still feel bad for her. The old woman is so over the top creepy and weird that it is difficult for us to care for her. And later, well, she doesn't do anything to make us feel empathy for her. But why do we feel for Christine when she is basically doing a selfish thing? Because Raimi has illustrated her environment for us. Her boss is extremely no-nonsense and Sam is clearly ready to stab her in the back and do whatever he has to do to get the promotion instead of her.

She and Clay have been seeing each other for some time and it quickly becomes apparent that Clay's well-to-do mother doesn't approve of his choice. An impending dinner with Clay's parents merely serves to boost Christine's anxiety and make everything else seem all the more pressing and urgent. As she believes she has cured herself, she urges Clay to take her to his parents as planned. And much to their surprise, the dinner seems to be going well. But then everything unravels and these old insecurities come back to haunt Christine.

Justin Long is good as Clay, the caring, devoted boyfriend who offers everything he can to Christine. It is a rare non-comedic turn for him and he makes it work.

Lorna Raver (lots of TV appearances, usually as Judges) does a very good job of convincing us she is an old gypsy woman. From the moment she first enters Christine's bank, with a heavy accent and wrapped in traditional gypsy clothing, Mrs. Ganush asks Christine for help and the young lady tries to be empathetic. As the woman sits at her desk, waiting, she takes out her fake teeth and begins to gum some candy sitting on the loan officer's desk. Later, as Christine leaves the bank, the old gypsy woman pops up to extract revenge from the woman she believes shamed her. They have a knock out fight that seems incredulous but given the woman's conviction, you simply laugh at the extremes of it.

Adrianna Barraza also is quite convincing as the spiritual guide. It is a small role, but memorable because she seems to take t so seriously, giving the film gravity it needs to make it a little scarier.

This isn't to say that Raimi doesn't try to inject a few gross out moments throughout the film. Ultimately, these are effective but so over the top you really can't do anything but laugh at them.

And there are moments when everything seems to be very over the top. Make no mistake, Raimi isn't afraid to go there, to go over the top, but when you realize it is done in good form, you can't do anything but smile.

And laugh.

It is SUPPOSED to have a cheesy twist(NO one was trying to make a Sixth Sense II), and we could care less if this wasn' as good as Evil Dead II, or if it was a rip off(that needs a remake anyway...), etc.

3917574,3,B002EEOE34,"""Drag me to Hell"" is director Sam Raimis' latest offering to the horror genre.
Having already had hits with such films as the ""Evil Dead Trilogy"", ""The Grudge"" and ""30 days of night"" - it didn't take a brain surgeon to realise the kind of movie I was about to view
.
The story centres around Christine Brown played by Alison Lohman - Working as a loan officer in the local bank, Brown has the unenviable task of dealing with a rather dirty, disgusting gypsy woman who has failed to keep up her mortgage repayments.

Torn between doing the right thing for the woman and demonstrating to her boss that she has management material, Brown decides against giving the woman a loan extension and in doing so shames' the old woman publically. In retaliation for this humiliation, the gypsy woman places a supernatural curse on the unfortunate Brown.

In 3-days time a demon from Hell will enter our world and take Browns' soul to purgatory forever. The race is now on for her to find a way of preventing this from happening and to seek redemption.
After enlisting the help of a ""Seer"", Brown is put in contact with a medium that has fought this demonic beast before - On that occasion she was defeated and the unfortunate soul was lost. Will the medium be successful second time around?

If you're looking for a truly frightening horror movie then this film is not for you. Think of Evil Dead and your well on the way to discovering what this movie is like. Comedic moments are aplenty and the music score and shock tactics which is Raimis' trademark provide you with enough material to look away in disgust rather than fear.

This movie is definitely a throw-back to the old 80's style horror flick and if that's your thing you're going to love it. If you prefer your horror movies a bit classier and a little more believable then stay away and rent it on DVD at a later date.

3917575,5,B002EEOE34,"I've been to ""Hell"" and back...and I'm going again this weekend.  I approached ""Drag Me to Hell"" with a little trepidation.  I love most of Sam Raimi's work and I'm a huge fan of the Evil Dead / Army of Darkness franchise.  That said, the advance buzz on this movie was so overwhelmingly positive (sitting at 93% on Rotten Tomatoes), I was thinking perhaps Raimi's ""return to horror"" was going to be scary, yet conventional.

What I got was not only unconventional, but an all out assault on my senses (in the most complimentary way) of sight, sound and good taste.  I'm not going to give a synopsis of the film, as that can be found any number of places, but I would like to say that Alison Lohman is terrific as Christine Brown, and watching her transformation from meek, small down girl to crazed ""Ash-like"" grave digging ""loony toon"" is almost worth the price of admission itself.

The only two criticisms I have are Justin Long as the boyfriend (and I loved him in ""Live Free or Die Hard--no bias here) makes an unconvincing doctor and doesn't appear to ""get the material as well as Lohman and a ""twist"" ending that you'll spot from a mile away.  That said, the way they handle said twist FEELS perfectly in tone with the movie, and it still made me smile.

This is a quick and dirty little film with some good jumps, plenty of laughs, gross things and a nasty little mean streak.  Think of it as an amusement park ride--it'll scare you while you're watching, make you feel stupid for being scared, and want to do it all over again.

And relax, people: I'm sure the kitten is fine!",1244160000,,1586,4.4567474048442905
3917576,5,B002EEOE34,"You don't have to be a huge fan of horror films to love Drag Me to Hell, you just have to understand them a little bit.  Sam Raimi is a one of a kind talent.

Here he has created a film that takes the slapstick three stooges approach and celebrates the horror genre with fantastic enthusiasm, all the while creating a timely allegory denouncing greed.  Like it or not, this is a film that successfully satires and criticizes the twisted and vile dynamics in corporate politics, and the abundance of pride in our everyday lives.

Drag Me to Hell follows a loan officer at a small bank branch named Christine, who denies an extension to an old gypsy woman on her mortgage loan.  She does this because she is in competition with a co-worker for a promotion, and her boss pushed her toward her decision.  The old woman curses Christine.  After over 20 years Drag Me to Hell's audience is quickly brought back to Sam Raimi's delightful horror funhouse once again and Raimi has not missed a beat.

The cast here is great.  Allison Lohman plays Christine and stars in almost every frame of the movie.  She seems to understand how her naive character deserves her curse.  I heard that Ellen Page was the first choice for the role but backed out, and now I wonder if Page could have handled playing the role with so much innocence, yet knowing her character is still an accountable adult.  It goes against Page's typical role in almost every way.  However, Lohman nails it.  The supporting cast is just as strong, with Justin Long playing Christine's psychologist boyfriend, Lorna Raver as the hilariously dramatic old gypsy woman, David Paymer as her disgusting boss, Reggie Lee as her equally disgusting competition at work, Dileep Rao as the refreshingly serious seer who attempts to aid Christine through her curse, and Molly Cheek and Chelcie Ross as the ultra shallow parents of Christine's boyfriend who she must win over.  The cast is so full of character you can't help but credit Raimi here too.  They all seemed to weave their performances with the same sense of hyperbole, and for me it worked to make every scene in the film intriguing and humorous.

The style here is very similar to the cult classic Evil Dead II, as the special effects are just cartoonish enough to jibe with the blend of slapstick comedy and supernatural horror.  The cinematography is from Peter Deming, whose style saturates films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mulholland-Drive/dp/B00005JKJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mulholland Drive</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/From-Hell/dp/B000JSI7B2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">From Hell</a>, and of course Evil Dead II.  Raimi coordinates a fun and engaging story with truly rich characters that also lends itself perfectly to the style he used that made some of his earlier films cult classics.  Drag Me to Hell is destined to become the same.  It is unique, compelling, and extremely inventive.  A gutsy diamond in the rough among the bloated and blindingly expensive blockbusters this summer.  See it now.",1244160000,,4015,6.015817223198594
3917577,4,B002EEOE34,"YES, the film is supposed to be funny and silly. Whether you find it funny or not depends on your sense of humor. Alot of ink has been thrown out regarding this film and it being Sam Raimi's return to the genre that helped create him as the fan favorite director that he is now. It's fairly clever hype for starved fans of the genre, but like all hype it's ultimately beside the point. Especially considering Raimi directed the brilliant A Simple Plan ten years ago, and I would much rather see him direct more films like that. Drag Me To Hell isn't as over the top absurd as Evil Dead II or as starkly grim as The Gift(which was his real last genre effort in the realm of anything horror) but it falls somewhere in between and easily glides back and forth between them.

This film does something I find very special, and something that only Raimi seems to excel in, horror and comedy in the same stroke. Sure, there's been a ton of horror-comedies like An American Werewolf In London, but the terror in that film is played straight. What Raimi does in this film, and for the first time, is create a creep out/scare factor in a scene and then punctuate it with over the top gross outs or black humor and he manages not to sink his ship while doing it. The movie opens with a straight and old fashioned terror scene, it's very effective, and then sets up our main character in a believable cinema world. Then we meet our gypsy villain and when she attacks our heroine in her car the tone is officially set and tips its hand to what is to be expected for the rest of the film. This is funhouse horror more interested in making the audience gasp, laugh from being had, getting repulsed by natural, but way over the top versions, of gross bodily functions, and shouting boo at you from an opposite direction, and it's bloody well done.

Allison Lohman(Where The Truth Lies, Matchstick Men) plays our cursed main character and she is a very talented actor who desrves the exposure of a Lindsey Lohan and hopefully will get it through a mainstream project like this. She keeps this film from becoming the out and out parody the situations the story puts her in would normally dictate. Her honestly dry and restrained performance lends itself to some dark comic moments later in the film after she's been continuously and violently taunted by a demon. Justin Long plays her boyfriend in the film and he adds the audience voice playing a psychiatry teacher who doesn't believe in anything supernatural. He adds to the grounding effect while being a winning and likeable foil for Lohman. David Paymer has a small part in the film and has my favorite line of dialogue, ""Did any get in my mouth?"" Unfortunately Bruce Campbell was too busy for a cameo but Ted Raimi's voice shows up as well as a certain yellow wreck Raimi refers to as ""The Classic"" shows up, a car that's been in all of Sam Raimi's films with the exception of The Quick And The Dead for obvious reasons.

Much attention is always been given to Raimi films for their intricate camera work and editing style, and this film is no exception, but notice must be given to the brilliant sound design. All his films are so specific and interestingly atmospheric due to the sound effects. This film gets some great jumps and tension out of sound effects. Christopher Young's score is quite good and effective as well. It has the over the top boistorousness of Goldsmith's score for the original The Omen and the twangs that reminded me of the scores for Gremlins and Pumpkinhead. Really good soundtrack.

Now I'm no fanboy, so I can admit to having some gripes with the film. Firstly, there's a scene involving an anvil that really took me out of the movie for a bit. It was too silly, lost the reality that the Lohman character warrante4d, and was ultimately ineffective as a shock or a humorous moment. It just seemed like a silly and on the nose attempt at throwing an homage at us from Evil Dead II. Secondly, the climax's final twist is a bit too telographed. The moment isn't a revelation but the set piece manages to be effective in its sound and visual splendor, so it's a minor complaint. Anyway, personally, I tire of 'plot' details in modern American films. If the journey is well done and worth treading, I could care less about the 'surprise' ending. Finally, towards the middle of the second act the fright deflates from the film and doesn't come back until the finale. The film skates such a razor's edge for the first half jumping from absurdist humor and terror with such ease that it was disappointing to find it settling for pure absurdity in the third act. Though, the best scene in the film has to be the seance scene which goes for broke and throws every filmic trick in the book at you and comes out with the audience gasping for air while smiling to themselves.

This film is not for the pompous individuals who proclaim themselves horror 'purists', whatever the hell that means. This film won't terrify or disturb anyone over the age of eight. It doesn't examine any relevant social issues of the modern world through the filter of horror. It's a simple E.C. Comics-like morality tale. The concept's not new but it feels that way thanks to Mr. Raimi who, despite his many imitators, still sees things in a filmic way that is truly individual. He knows that the horror genre is one of the only genres in film that has an umbrella that many different variations can comfortabley fit under. What genre would you say Seven, Silence Of The Lambs, Dead Alive, Evil Dead II, and Rosemary's Baby fit under? I'm going with horror, but as any jock, emo kid, cheerleader, or goth kid will tell you, lables suck man.

This is the first film of the summer movie season that truly satisfied me. I smiled a bunch after the credits rolled. It's totally FUN disposable Hollywood entertainment that actually does what it set out to do for once.

The blu ray while sounding AWESOME and the picture being AMAZING is a bit disappointing in the special features department. NO commentary by Raimi or his callaboraters, which if you've listened to any of the Evil Dead commentaries you'll know what a blast he and his associates are to listen to.  We get a half-hearted Justin Long hosted series of featurettes.  There's no flow to them.  One subject pops up and we get a shallow overview and then we're off to the next thing.  The whole behind the scenes portion only adds up to just under a thirty minutes.  As far as UNRATED, there's only one noticeable difference.  The 'cat scene' is gorier.  Not extreme, but blood does fly.  The problem I have with this new scene is that the punchline of the following shot(her heaping dirt over an unmarked grave) is less of a funny edit.  Also, we get a much bloodier version of the nosebleed scene which amps up the twisted comedy of the concept.  Thankfully the blu ray gives you the option of the theatrical or unrated version.

PS: The PG-13 rating doesn't effect the outcome of this film AT ALL. There's nothing in this film that an R rating would've improved. Sorry. Take solace though, Raimi confirmed an unrated DVD coming out in about three months. Hell, by today's standards, Raimi's own Army Of Darkness would be rated PG-13! Actually, Army Of Darkness should've been rated PG-13 back then too, if you think about it.",1243900800,,7320,4.574809160305343
3917578,4,B002EEOE34,"I've read a few (interesting)reviews so i thought i'd just put out my impressions.

General impressions- Having seen Raimi's Evil Dead trilogy and being a fan of it, i have to say i like this movie.  Like Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness, it's kinda corny and cheesy in places; but there are also some genuine scares and overall they take the subject matter seriously(like in the original).  Don't go in expecting Evil Dead 4, lots of gore, efx, and monsters or stuff like that.  Do expect an almost old-fashioned scare-fest with minimal cgi(refreshing in and of itself) although it has its fair share.  With all the non-scary, cgi-filled, action-esque, 'horror' films of late, its nice to see something like this for a change.

Specific impressions(possible spoilers)- Man, is this movie loud or what?  Scary noises borderlined on loud, annoying noises after awhile(i guess that was the intention?).  I do like how Raimi brought back old-hag-as-scary as opposed to little-girl-as-scary(we've had plenty of those films).  And personally, i found the old woman in this film to be very effective.  I like the cute female lead and who can resist Justin Long as a bf in a supporting role(not being sarcastic, and not being gay).  I do think there were too many BOO-type scares, which i feel is like cheating sometimes, but there were also some nice atmospheric scares which i really appreciate(the hooves behind the door in shadow form was nice).

Overall, i enjoyed myself and so did the few people that were in the theater with us(it was dead in there folks).  It's not Raimi at his best, but it's a nicely done, well-paced, slick, 'little' horror film to give you a few scares.  Or, at least a few startles.  Btw, did i mention this movie was loud?  3 1/2, recommended.",1243814400,,1768,4.785478547854786
3917579,5,B002EEOE34,"You will laugh, you will cry, you will screanm, you will die!  This is a roller coaster of a movie.  What other movie could leave your face hurting from laughing, but still leave you creeped out!",1243814400,,195,4.388888888888889
3917580,2,B002EEOE34,"I'm get right to the point. This is a blatant rip-off of a terrific horror film called Curse of the Demon (also released as Night of the Demon), which was based upon the classic story The Casting of the Runes.  Some might call it an homage, but that's ridiculous. It actually smears the original, which was a taught thriller about the possibility of occult forces and mankind's inability to control them -- with a central character based on Aleister Crowley, the famed British ""magus."" If you're going to make a farce -- and Drag Me to Hell is certainly that -- don't destroy an old film in the process, and probably prevent the possibility of a serious remake of that classic. (Curse of the Demon could stand a remake, too. Studios looking to cash in -- when aren't they? -- forced the inclusion of a hideously fake looking demon into the movie to generate teen interest.)

The film is entertaining in a silly way, but the the acting ranges from passably flat (Justin Long) to tone deaf awful (Alison Lohman), who has pretty brown eyes and that's about it. There is an old gypsy crone who is enjoyably disgusting, but it's a pretty sad statement when the best moments in the film involve her removing her dentures and getting her eye stapled shut with a Swingline. Could have done without the guy vomiting a fake looking kitten. When a moment like that isn't even funny, you know Raimi's off his stride. Bad material will do that.

There is a ""twist"" ending that only a dullard wouldn't see coming a mile away in a silly scene that transparently manufactured to generate it. And there are lots and lots of throwaways, including parents who have dinner and are never seen again.

I liked Evil Dead 2. I even liked Army of Darkness. A lot.  This fails to capture the gleeful, over-the-top fun of those films and the acting doesn't even come close.

Go if you're okay with rewarding a rip-off. But, this lightweight fare is diverting, but quickly digested and soon forgotten.",1243728000,4,1973,4.622857142857143
3917581,3,B002EEOE34,"The reviews are in and Sam Raimi's DRAG ME TO HELL seems to be a resounding success--with everyone but me that is. I wanted desperately to like this film because I fell in love with Raimi's work about 15 minutes into EVIL DEAD 2 which was my first experience with his goofy, super-kinetic style and like almost every horror fan I've been eagerly/anxiously awaiting his return to the genre. Unfortunately DRAG ME TO HELL simply isn't the film I was waiting for. I can understand why so many others have embraced it because it is slick and it's better than 98% of the stuff that studios have vomited upon multiplex screens for the past decade or so, but that doesn't mean it's a good Sam Raimi film. For that reason I've decided to write the dissenting opinion to my friend Woopak's majority opinion of this film. However before I go any further its important for me to reiterate my method of judging any film. I've always felt that a film should be judged on how well they've succeeded with what they've had to work with. This puts low budget films on a more even footing with blockbuster flix like STAR WARS for instance where everything they need is available to them and the only excuse they have for turning out a bad film is lack of talent. Low budget films on the other hand face limitless challenges and thus I cut them an appropriate amount of slack. That said, let's move on.

Woopak calls this film ""astonishing familiar"", that certainly is true but I've never regarded that as a virtue. What made Raimi the sensation that he became was the fact that everything about his films was unexpected, unpredictable, innovative, and original. He was a breath of fresh air. Here he is stale and seems to be relying on ""homages"" entirely too much. I don't object to this at all, in fact I enjoy it under normal circumstances, but when the entire denouement of your film relies on CURSE OF THE DEMON you're ruining the film for a large portion of your audience that has figured out your ending a good 40 minutes before you get there--and that's just not fun. This film does not feel like a ""throwback"" to Raimi's past as Woopak claims. It doesn't even feel the least bit silly when compared to the exalted heights of goofiness achieved in EVIL DEAD 2.  Of course we can chalk this up to opinion I suppose, but which is sillier, being attacked in your car by an old crone who's trying to gum you to death and stapling her in the head, or being flipped off by your own hand after you've cut it off with a chainsaw because its spent the last five minutes trying to kill you? No contest.

Woopak welcomes Raimi's return to his ""bombastic"" style. I mourn the fact that this once truly creative and ingenious director has not grown beyond using a camera technique he copped from THE HAUNTING and then ""up-dating"" it by adding EXTREMELY LOUD noises and then using the same technique over and over again. He just shoves something in our face with a VERY LOUD NOISE and repeats ad nauseum. Loud is not SCARY. LOUD is simply LOUD. Granted a couple of the early scares do work very well, but whatever happened to the idea of setting up the scares? There is very little set up time here. If Raimi's going to give us non-stop horror like in ED2 then give us non-stop horror. If he's going to play it more conventional as he does here, then he needs more set up time that's just a fact of life.

Woopak claims that DRAG ME TO HELL is loaded with ""frenzied slapstick"" and ""cheeky comedy"". Great, that's what I was looking for, but we must have seen different movies. I suppose the part where the hag was trying to gum the girl to death was supposed to be funny so I'll count that one. And I guess the ""Here kitty, kitty"" line when she goes to kill her kitten was supposed to be funny so I'll count that one too. And then there was the scene in the garage involving the eyeballs but that was just a double-barreled rehash of a scene from EVIL DEAD 2, Raimi referencing himself, I almost laughed at that one. Maybe if you pointed out the laughs to me it would help. As ""hilarious as EVIL DEAD 2"" ? No way Jose! There's nothing as cool as Bruce looking into the mirror and trying to collect himself  by saying ""We're alright"" only to have his reflection reach out and grab him and reply ""We just cut our girlfriend up with a chainsaw. Does that sound alright to you?"" THAT'S funny! ED2 is loaded with that kind of stuff. Now you're going to tell me that DRAG ME TO HELL is supposed to be grounded in the REAL world--when you're cursed and you've got a lamia coming after you what's so real about that?

Woopak himself points out that there is 'nothing new"" in this film, that it ""does nothing to reinvent the genre"". Well sir, that happens to be what the EVIL DEAD films were all about! They were all about being being so unsure of what was around the next corner that your head was literally spinning! They were about thinking ""I don't know what this crazy guy is going to do next, AND I LOVE IT!!!""  And what do we get in DRAG ME TO HEll? a rehash of a scene from POLTERGEIST. In his review Woopak uses such words as ""mediocre"" ""ordinary"" and ""predictable"" to refer to this film and  I couldn't agree with him more.  And I know where the fault lies, the script.  When it comes to writing, Raimi is a great director.  My advice to him is to stick to directing and to look for pre-existing material that he can work with because as a writer he is clearly not up to the challenge. What was wrong with SPIDERMAN 3?  The script. Who wrote it? Sam and his brother Ivan. What's wrong with this movie? It's primarily the script. Who wrote it?  Yep.

At this point I suppose I should confess and say that I originally gave this film a 2 star rating to get your attention. In reality it's more of a 3.5 which is still nothing to write home about. I'm sure I'll get tons of negative votes from people who won't even bother to read what I have to say. Well, that's life I guess. From a lesser talent this would be a 4 star film, but I expected more from this film because after all it's Sam F'ing Raimi we're talking about here!

I've heard rumors that Raimi plans to remake EVIL DEAD for the new generation. I pray to God that this isn't true.

3917582,3,B002EEOE34,"'Drag Me To Hell' should speak for itself; the title alone sums it up in a nutshell. It calls forth images of tattered appendages and over-the-top gore, a gaudy, campy roller coaster ride, and that's exactly what 'Drag Me To Hell' is. Sam Raimi, director of the absurdly popular and lucrative Spider-Man series, directed this little camp-horror nugget of a film, and it shows. 'Drag Me To Hell' shares much of the same absurdity and comic book-like camp of the third Spider-Man film, and displays a lot of the outrageousness of old-school horror flicks.

One critic compared this movie to Quentin Tarantino's Grindhouse, and it's a very legitimate comparison; like Grindhouse's Planet Terror, Drag Me To Hell is outrageous, over the top, and gory, but more grotesque gory than violent gory. Unfortunately, what I don't agree with is that Drag Me To Hell is better than Grindhouse; Drag Me To Hell isn't quite sure what it wants to be. The previews paraded it as a high-class, deeply frightening horror film that claimed to be a 'return to form' of the horror genre. Drag Me To Hell is neither high-class nor deeply frightening; it's the kind of ridiculous, wildly weird horror-comedy you see bits and pieces of in movies like the aforementioned Grindhouse, Sin City, and the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

The plot, as you all already know from the preview, is that banker Christine Brown is vying for the Assistant Manager position at her work, and so in spite of her better judgment, denies a freaky-looking old woman an extension on her mortgage payment to prove to her boss she's capable of making tough decisions. Naturally, the old woman just happens to be a crazed gypsy witch and lays a horrible curse on Christine, the ultimate intention of which is to, you guessed it, drag her to Hell. The scene in which Ms. Ganush (the old woman) attacks Christine in the parking lot is not nearly as creepy as it seemed in the preview; in fact, it's very comical and dragged out, almost like a PG-13 episode of Looney Tunes. The two women get into a frenzied, overblown brawl in Christine's car, during which Ganush's eye is stapled shut, her dentures go flying out of her mouth (we receive grotesque close-ups of both scenes), and in a very Scary Movie-ish turn of events, she goes soaring out the windshield of the car, only to pop back up with a random heavy object to break the window and continue brawling.

The main gimmick of the curse is that it's not actually a curse; more accurately, Ganush calls forth a demon to haunt Christine, the fabled Lamia, a goat (yes, goat) demon that lays very specific plagues on its victim (much like the dybbuk from The Unborn). The Lamia causes Christine to see all sorts of bizarre images, mainly images of Ms. Ganush herself (either walking aimlessly in the street, appearing on the screen of Christine's cell phone, or lying in her bed, each time suddenly opening her mouth menacingly and hissing or screaming), but also images of houseflies with a penchant for crawling into human mouths, slices of cake sprouting eyeballs, etc.

There is a sense of hopelessness Christine feels throughout this predicament, mainly because numerous attempts to free herself of the curse and the Lamia fail; to make matters worse, everyone else, including her boyfriend Clay (Justin Long, believable but not given much to work with), can't see any of the things she is seeing, so of course many just end up assuming she's losing her mind. This could have tied back in to Christine's frustrations at work and frustrations within her relationship (it is hinted at that she doesn't feel good enough for Clay due to a conversation she overhears him having with his mother, in which she doubts that Christine is a good match for her son), and the overall recurring underlying theme of Christine's lack of self-confidence and persistent undeserved hardships, to give the movie a soul and something that could be taken seriously, but ultimately, as the camp, the cheesiness and the nasty, gross-out gore pile up, it becomes virtually impossible to take Drag Me To Hell seriously, and so as a result you don't much care about the characters or the direction in which they head (which tends to be useless when it comes to movies of this sort anyhow).

Alison Lohman's Christine verges on emotionless at times; she reacts and screams, but she's far more levelheaded about all this curse brouhaha than the average person would be. Her fear and melancholy are believable, but her reactions to some of the movie's most outrageous events, namely a corpse flopping onto her body and emitting grotesque amounts of embalming fluid on/into her mouth and face, dismembered eyeballs and bodily tissue flailing across her own, a talking goat (yes, a talking goat-you'll feel like you're watching Roger Rabbit by that point), and a demonically possessed man levitating towards her and proceeding to vomit the corpse of her undead kitten (once again, onto her face), feel muted. Granted, as the movie goes on, this ends up playing to her advantage-Lohman serves as the movie's anchor, because without her, this creative direction would've undeniably spun out of control and gone from bizarre and campy to just plain stupid and bad.

As displayed in the preview (and as with most movies of this sort, including The Unborn and so forth), near the end she desperately seeks the help of a psychic medium and there is of course a seance. This scene is also not nearly as intense or creepy as it seemed in the preview; in fact, two of the aforementioned outrageous scenes (the talking goat and cat corpse-vomiting) both occur during this time. By this point, it becomes relatively clear that Drag Me To Hell is aiming to be at least relatively comedic, and it does at least succeed at that (I don't know about everyone else, but I heard far more laughter in my theater than gasps and screams).

While these may all seem like criticisms, the movie does have its upsides-its biggest asset is the world it creates, the sort of mysterious, surreal universe we witness in movies like Sin City and even the Harry Potter series, enriching the screen with bright, vivid colors, strange creatures and characters abound, making the viewer feel like they're locked in some sort of horrifying fairy tale. Two and a half stars may have been a more accurate rating; the movie's definitely not terrible, but I really can't say it lives up to the surprisingly high amount of praise and positive reviews. The ending is unsatisfying to me but is a typical horror movie ending, if that's your thing. Thankfully, however, the movie has some comedy, a good amount of shock value, a strong emotional anchor in Lohman's Christine, and Justin Long is likable as usual. Overall, Drag Me To Hell doesn't quite reach what it set out to be and is not what it's promoted as being, but it's moderately entertaining and worth watching for extreme horror movie buffs and those who don't mind (or enjoy) gross-out gore and campy/comedic scary movies.",1243728000,2,7018,4.833610648918469

8367664,4,B002EEOE34,"While I won't attempt to be too technical here (as I would come off as ignorant on the topic as I am), I will say that this BD brought a nice crisp transfer, along with booming loud sound. The additional extras are decent, but certainly not exhaustive by any means. A commentary track from Raimi is missing--and there won't be a definitive release until one is recorded.

Regarding the film itself, well, this is a roller coaster of funny/horror--Raimi will make you laugh, scream, laugh, scream, in varying orders--and he'll use every cheap, ridiculous, and robustly and artistically designed trick in the book to get you there. Allison Lohman is in top form here, still in her big star days, around that Matchstick Men period. Her accent is silly, but otherwise she's very present and fun to follow, as are her costars.

I'd recommend watching the theatrical version first--the unrated version appears to have some cheap CG blood thrown in in aftereffects to attract a post-theater audience, which is unnecessary and distracting.",1521504000,2,1031,4.988372093023256
