1261487,4,B00003CWRE,"This remake ""terror"" movie is so funny, I must give it 4-star!  The cast is very good, and is fun to see PEter Gallagher in the middle of this crazy trip !  No scary moments here, only good special effects and  characters with double personalities and totally stereotyped.

1261488,4,B00003CWRE,"House on Haunted hill was a much better horror movie than TheHaunting.  However, it did suffer the same fate as the Haunting,although it was much more minor.  Up until a certain point, the movie was very scary and kept me on my seat.  I'll still buy this movie, but wish they could redo the ending.",953942400,,298,4.381818181818182

1261491,3,B00003CWRE,"""House on Haunted Hill"" is a fairly decent horror flick based on the classic from 1958.  It suffers from predictability and overdone special effects, but the cast (mainly Geoffrey Rush and Famke Janssen) is superb  and convincing.  There are lots of good scares in this film, as well as  some cheap and expected thrills.  The ending is ruined by overly  ostentatious special effects that kind of nullify the good thrills  throughout.  All in all, ""House on Haunted Hill"" passes as a  horror film.",952041600,2,496,4.879518072289157

1261543,4,B00003CWRE,"The first time I saw this movie in theatres I left halfway through it.  It is definitely scary, but is interesting enough to have me come back to see the rest.  My favorite part of this movie is the performance by Famke  Janssen.  She executed every line excellently and was also funny.  Ali  Larter and Taye Diggs were also good.  The most surprising performance was  by Chris Kataan from SNL.  He plays the cowardly owner of the house and was  so different than any other character he had ever portrayed on SNL.  If you  like a good scare, you'll love ""The House on Haunted Hill"".",962582400,,582,4.438095238095238
1261544,3,B00003CWRE,"I watched this movie at night,lights out,and i was not scared but a little spooked. I did,however,find this movie to be very strange but a lot better than these so-called 'scary' movies that are out..(I.E. Blair Witch) It's  about a Haunted House (You guessed that already..hehe) and people go to it  to stay there over night and get money. I have one simple,simple  question..If all the murders were down in the basement then WHY did they  keep on going down there?  They would have been a lot safer upstairs than  in the basement...who goes wandering in the basement after somebody's been  murdered down there? But,it was very enjoyable and i recommend it to people  who like movies such as this one. Slightly bloody,nothing to,to terrible.

1261546,1,B00003CWRE,I will simply list the reasons I thought The House on Haunted Hill was one of the worst movies I've seen in quite some time. 1.  Bad acting. 2.  Bad Effects.  I could do better on my iMac. 3.  Not very scary.  A horror movie  with no surprises. 4.  Poorly written.  The potential for some interesting  twists were there.  They could have added to the original. This movie  wasted 1 1/2 hours of my life.,957744000,,403,4.24

If you want to sink $100+  dollars into this movie, you were either in it and want to burn every copy  possible, or you haven't seen a real horror movie.",957571200,3,419,4.073170731707317
1261548,5,B00003CWRE,"This one of the coolest movies ever. About an amusement-park owner named Steven Price (Geoffrey Rush) who decided to have his pampered wife's (Famke Janssen) birthday party in an old abandoned asylum. He rips up her own  birthday list, then invites five strangers to the thing, offering each one  $1 million dollars if they can stay alive through the night. The former  asylum has a dark secret: 60 years previous, the strange, inhumane  experiments performed on the insane who lived there got a little out of  hand. No one was obviously watching the place, and so, all of the patients  got out and killed almost all of the staff. The five invited to the party  (Marissa Marr, Taye Diggs, Ali Larter, Chris Katan, and.. I think it's  William Malone but I'm not sure) think it's all fun and games... Until  lockdown comes into play and shuts every door and window in the house. Now,  unable to get out, they are finally realizing that the murder committed 60  years ago isn't done, and that some spirit still lives within the  walls...
This movie may not have been origional (because it is a remake  of a classic) but it is still VERY scary and VERY good!",956880000,3,1154,4.598039215686274
1261549,4,B00003CWRE,"Bearing the same name, same plots, and same ideas behind the original ""House on Haunted Hill"", one would expect to see natural remake of a masterpiece (ok, perhaps only I was, but than again, perhaps not).
 And at first, it seems to ring true. However, quickly it is learned that  this is not the same movie, but it is almost certainly as entertaining.
  Rush is not Price, never will be Price, and therefore cannot be expected to  perform exactly the same as Price. While I contend that Price simply had  the role by the same name immortalized, I must concede that Rush did bring  a brilliant flare to the screen. This is not an academy award contending  film, and his ability to shift from a career based mostly on nobility to  something just a bit more sadistic is impressive. Jim Carrey managed the  exact opposite.
 I saw a review on here not too long ago before I saw the  movie that said ""Campy is Fun"" in the heading. I mention that  because I'm not a big fand of campy films and therefore I somehow surmized  from this one heading that I would not enjoy this movie. Now, I acknowledge  the author of that heading and fully agree with him.
 Not to spoil the  movie for those who haven't seen it, I will touch on certain plots while  attempting not to give away much.
 The turn-arounds between Mrs. Price  and Mr. Price are hilarious, especially when one thinks the other is dead  and the film u-turns so the other consider the other to be dead. Much like  the original, this movie milks the fight between wills for every scent its  worth, only without the seriousness.
 Gallagher made me laugh by his  manner in the film, he simply seemed so displaced. Mind you, I do not mean  his acting (as most acting in this film should not be analyzed), but simply  his charisma.
 The movie  begins to lack in fun, though, when it loses its campy humor and jumps  fully to supernatural toward the end. Not just supernatural, but ruins a  terrific monster concept (the scene where Rush sees the dead mad doctor on  the video screen after finding his employee's face... uh... removed... is  the most memorable in the film). I wish they had stuck with the mad doctor  instead of the all- encompassing darkness only because... well, what can be  done with darkness? It can float and speak, the amusement of that dies out  eventually.
 The opening scenes are splended (especially the rip off of  Tower of Terror) and Chris Kattan offers an amusingly overdramatic  peformance. The end, unfortunately, loses fuel and burns out. Still, it is  a notable movie, perfect the for late night ""gore"" hunger.",956707200,,2590,4.5820568927789935
1261550,5,B00003CWRE,"I think this movie was excellant. It was scary but also funny. When I saw this movie in the theater with my friends we had to jump out of our seats and leave the theater 3 times. When the movie began with the Insane Assylum  I was freaked, especially how the doctor tormented his patiences. When a  man who owns a theme park has a party he has it in the House on Haunted  Hill he is offering 1 million dollars to anyone that spent the night in the  assylum, but it turns out it wasn't a choice anymore...... this flick was a  non-stop thriller and I loved it!

It is very, very funny, action-paced, with absolute no pretension to be a state-of-art picture,  only a great ""B"" class-movie.

7917085,3,B00003CWRE,"The first question to pose when the credits roll and everybody heads home is ""If the flick is called House on Haunted Hill, why isn't the hill crawling with nasties?"" Not the last question of continuity to arise, it is certainly the first which must be immediatly forgotten if one wants to enjoy the show. Robert Zemeckis' and Joel Silver's 1999 freak-film quickly stumbles into more holes than Casino's desert, and yet remains an entertaining if trashy pic. Following the tradition of shlock-horror promoter William Castle, WB's remake faithfully refreshes the underground-indie splatter genre right down to the pocket change budget. Quite a step for a Hollywood studio.  Maybe too wide a step. Without advanced screening, and a Castle-like contest as the primary promotion, House seems to have been the company black sheep. Considering the final product executive confidence must've been understandebly shaky. For in every sound and frame, every note and flicker, House on Haunted Hill is a daring update of camp chaos and carnage cheese. Psychotic, psychedelic story mixed with thirties' style,`90s gratuity and wrapped up in shiny CGI for Halloween. As we go along, we shall see why this makes reality checks moot, and the movie fun.
THE PLOT (or How I Almost Ruin the Movie By Blabbing About the First Reel)
We open with the house. A tall, narrow concrete structure, resembling a twisted cathedral of the Third Reich. Night blankets the sky. Wind rushes mindlessly and ceaslessly against it's thick walls.
An orderly walks purposefully down the length of a hospital hall. His hands grip a trio of unsharpened pencils. Beyond him one can make out stretchers, white wooden cell doors and tannish brown walls. Old yellow lights bath the entire scene as if through a glass of good whiskey.
This as yet faceless man enters a sort of box office. He punches into work,methodically sharpens his pencils, blows the shavings away, puts on a record of classical music, and proceeds to author reports. The music is a relief.
You see, the halls reverberate with the screaming echos of the mad.
1931 is not a good year for the psychiatric proffession. Beneath its sterile and community surface the Vannacutt Psychiatric Institute for the Criminally Insane is in fact a source of insanity. Dr. Richard Vannacutt, director and head shrink, indulges his side hobby for physiology by tourturing and dismembering his helpless patients, strapping them down and slicing abdomens open.
Just such a scene greets our audience. The good doctor patiently plunges a scapel into a man's flesh. Helpless limbs pull against straps, screams muffled through surgical tape. Nurses calmly film everything for posterity.
As our dedicated pursuers of anatomy ""operate"", Dr. Vannacutt hears thumping noises. Above, patients crawl on an opaque skylight set in the ceiling. They leer and laugh. Hmm.
Back in the floor cage, our diligent report writer notices a particularly skeletal and gaunt patient staring at him through the wire screen service window. He ignores him, continuing with his scribbling, and totally unaware of the gaggle of loonies peering through the glass behind him.
Smash! In an instant the office is crowded with flailing limbs and snarling faces. A web of hands siezes the orderly. One of these hands also snatch a trio of freshly sharpened pencils-- and plunges them into and completely through the orderly's throat. Blood spurts out of the ragged hole and he gags on his own lifefluids.
It's all downhill from here.
Inmates burst into the operating room, smashing skulls and equipment alike. An electrical fire sparks. As nurses are drowned or sexually assaulted, Vannacutt lunges for a control throttle. He engages it just as his more affectionate patients dig their fingers into his body. The camera lady takes a nap on the floor, bleeding enthusiastically out of a massive head wound. Screen fades to black...
...And jerks back to life. We see a big bald oaf frown into the old-time camera lens as he cranks it himself. He manages to whip it around without breaking beat and records his buddies using scalpels to express their dissatisfaction with the Institute's patient care policy. The good doctors are captive audiences as it were, as the rebels get to the hearts of matters.
Cut to a television screen. An old newsreel depicts a flaming nut house, the voice over dramatically drooling about the grisly discovery of Vannacutt's psych ward turned crematorium. Guess it really was designed by a Nazi. Peter Graves, host of ""Terrifying But True""-- a typical Fox show-- tells us the ""site of his atrocities still exists, restored almost to its original condition"" and ""...spirits of Vannacutt and his victims still haunt the walls of the House on Haunted Hill"". And breaks for commercial.
It is now 1999 and a particularly sexy, particularly posionous young socialite sits in a tub and is inspired by this quality programing. She calls up her husband and tells him she knows where her next birthday party will be held. Sexy, and mentally questionable to boot.
For this woman is Mrs. Evelyn Price, mate of none other than billionare amusement park designer Steven Price. Taking his dress, features, and personality from the Vincent Price Prep School, he proves himself even more blantantly demented than she. Her call interrupts his grand opening of Terror Incognito; Price's new amusment park loaded with fake accidents and deceptive rides. He cuts their conversation short in order to give a tour to two reporters, using up a few minutes of film time to establish the sort of vaudville, carnival-style atmosphere which will quickly turn the story into Grade A chedder. After scaring the crap outta his paparazzi, Price resumes the plot by calling his wife back and after accusing her of all sorts of perversity, quickly acquiesces. But not the way she thinks. He shreds her guest list and generates his own, hoping to attract greedy, desperate people to turn the party into an amusing nightmare. A healthy relationship this is not.
Now something odd happens. After Price goes on to a board meeting, a shadow falls across his laptop, and by itself the guest list is rewritten and sent out. Those iMacs are something else.
Well, that is the setup. The rest of the story slips down into a dark basement of horror and decay. In fact, that is exactly where all of the ""boogers"" attack the hapless party-goers for most of the movie. Boogers are the various CGI things which leap out of CGI darkness and, well... the scene where a wannabe reporter stumbles into an operationg room is priceless. When she realizes she can see and hear ghosts on the camera but not with her own eyes, your heart skips with hers. You can practically feel the hairs on her neck rise when she slowly looks behind her to see... wh-- what's that SHAPE in the shadows by the only exit? N-now it's--AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!",984528000,2,6887,4.9991289198606275

7917087,3,B00003CWRE,"You know, I wanted to like this movie so bad, but the thing that I kept saying afterwards was ""it just didn't do it for me."" I didn't go see it opening weekend, because it was supposed to stink so bad, and there were no advance reviews.  Then I read some reviews that actually said it was fun, Entertainment Weekly gave it a B- (and unfortunately, gave away a couple big shocks in their d*%$ review), and went.
It started out great. What Geoffrey Rush does for a living is such a great gimmick, and I just wish I hadn't known what would happen. That's why I'm not going into the plot too much in this review. Famke Jansen is nice and nasty as his shrewish wife. Jeffrey Combs plays (YES!) a mad doctor again. Rush also is dressed exactly like Vincent Price, looks like him, and acts like James Woods (seriously, EW said that too -- I wonder if they didn't have him in mind. Rush looks the part much more, though).
Though for some reason, it just didn't scare me that much. Lots of cool gory parts, neat, trippy imagery, not too predictable. But I don't think I jumped once, and I really wanted to. Probably, if reviews I read hadn't given a few great moments away, I would have had more fun -- also if they audience was having more fun. There was only one part where people in the theater jumped, and it was a ""fake"" jump (you know, like ""AAAAAGH! Oh, it's you.  You scared the hell outta me"" type of cheap jump). I don't know what I would have done differently, and usually after a movie I don't like, I have very specific ideas and opinions about the various places the film makers went wrong, and what they should have done instead. Other than the ending being kind of anticlimactic, I don't know.
I will say this: it beat the hell out of ""The Haunting"" remake that came out this summer, though that's not saying much. The first 5 minutes alone were 20 times better and scarier than the whole Haunting POS put together. Definitely superior. Oh well, you could do worse. The opening scenes alone are worth watching the movie for. Better than most of the junky horror movies put out last year, and like I said, MUCH better than, say, ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer"".",980985600,,2175,4.354679802955665
7917088,1,B00003CWRE,"Billonaire Steven Price (Geoffrey Rush) arranges a party at the abandoned Vannacutt Psychiatrist Institute for the Criminally Insane (in short, House  on Haunted Hill). The Institute was once the site of the most horrifying  medical experiences in history. Price announces that anyone who manages to  spend an entire night in the house will win $1,000,000! He has secretly  rigged the house with insidious devices designed to scare the guests out of  staying, but his tricks soon become meaningless, as thr mansion begins to  generate terror on its own. Before their night of terror is over, the  desperate inhabitants will unlock the secrets of the house or suffer the  wrath of the demonic evil that haunts the walls of the former insane  asylum.
House on Haunted Hill is a forgettable movie with laughable  performances and a flippin' terrible script. It is equally terrible with  The Haunting, 1999's other so-bad-it's-funny try-hard 1999 horror.",969235200,,950,5.225165562913907
7917089,1,B00003CWRE,"This is the first one star rating I have given and it is well deserved.  Much of this movie makes no sense and the ending is so bad that my friend  thought I was possessed because I was rolling my eyes in disgust so  much.
The plot revolves around Mr. Price who owns an amusement park  empire.  He and his reviling wife (played by a fetching, yet cold Famke  Janssen) hate each other but throw this party at an insane asylum.  He rips  up her party list and creates a new one, only to have that one changed by a  ""mysterious force"".
The house on Haunted Hill you see, is  haunted.  Long ago, a crazy psychiatrist (see how important background  checks are?) did some live human experiments, causing a riot, then a fire,  then the deaths of all but 5 of the residents.  These loonies, since  they're crazy, can't go to heaven because Heaven, I guess, is like  California (only for the beautiful people).  So their now evil (and still  loony) spirits are in the house and have taken it over.
So now these 5  beautiful people (or fairly average looking if this is set in California)  are in the house with the house owner, Mr. Price and his wife.  Mr. Price  offers $1 million to anyone who can survive the night (is SURVIVOR a  spinoff of this movie?).
There are major plotholes and so many things  don't make sense.  Like, WHY DO THESE PEOPLE HAVE TO GO DOWN INTO THE  CREEPY BASEMENT ON THEIR OWN ALL THE TIME?  Every character is a piece of  cardboard and have even less personalities.  All we know about almost all  these people are their names and job title.  We never really find out WHY  THEY WOULD ACCEPT AN INVITATION TO THE HOUSE OF A PERSON THEY HAVE NEVER  MET?
Other plotholes, points of stupidity and other dumb things:
1.  If the house invited them, then why did they all get limo rides to the  house?  Who made up their invitation cards? 2. Why did that ghost save  Eddie Baker at the end of the movie, but let's everyone else die? 3. How  did Dr. Blackburn get invited, even though he was not invited by the house  or Mr. Price? 4. How come all the guns have real ammo but one suddenly does  not?  How could Mr. Price control that? 5. If this house is so severly  haunted and the owner knew about it, why didn't Watson Pritchett call the  Ghostbusters?
Even though the last one was in jest, this movie has so  many flaws, so many unanswered questions, so many unexplained happenings  that it just can't be believed.  I wonder if producer Joel Silver even read  the script?
The movie does have it's thrills in the beginning and the  double crosses had some measure of promise, but by the time the  ""evil"" is release, the movie goes from a spook-fest to an  over-the-top EFX festival like that other really bad horror movie,  ""The Haunting"".  If they opened a Webster's Dictionary and looked  up the definition of ""subtlety"", they might of had a far superior  movie.  The ""evil"" was the big joke of the movie according to me  and my friends.  It was just so....generic.
If you have just too much  money to waste, you can either go out and by this on DVD, but I prefer that  you give it to charity instead (at least you can get a tax deduction on  that).  If you are a Taye Diggs, Famke Janssen or Geoffrey Rush Fan, try  watching Go!, Rounders or Shine instead.  You've been warned...only fans of  truly bad movies need attend this waste of good actors in a stink-fest  movie....",966384000,5,3391,4.383495145631068
