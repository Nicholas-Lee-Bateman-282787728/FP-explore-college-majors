8316139,1,B0007T5WKC,"Cheezy filming. Horrible music. Acting even worse. If this was supposed to be erotica for women, it was still shot from a man's point of view. Not very good at all.",1349222400,,164,4.32258064516129
8316140,3,B0007T5WKC,"The couple Shanna and Mark is well worth watching but not the other three.

Todd's lovemaking is terrific and sweaty, romantic, steamy....PERFECT. His kisses are what I like the most and Mark Davis is to die for and I just was wondering why couldn't Liz and Todd be the only couple???, in fact they're the only one I have an interest in.

I don't understand why Candida Royalle is an ""acclaimed pioneer of women's erotica"" because after having watched ""The gift"", ""One size fits all"" and ""Eyes of desire"" I think all these films have one thing in common: LACK OF SENSUALITY.

I like graphic sex but I want tenderness, kisses, strokes, .....",1178582400,6,640,4.646017699115045
8316141,5,B0007T5WKC,"This is a great story ,especially if you are a romantic lover. It made me think about my marriage and life in a positive manner. This is not the kind of film that men traditionaly buy. But if you are looking for a way to get closer to your spouse try it. It actually has the ability to make you appreciate your relationships.",1167955200,8,325,4.174603174603175
8316142,3,B0007T5WKC,"Pornography by definition is the depiction of erotic behavior (as in pictures or writing) intended to cause sexual excitement. There are numerous items available on Amazon which could be considered pornographic in the books and video sections.

When it comes to films, pornography is loosely divided into two parts, softcore pornography, in which the sexual liaisons are assumed to be simulated and hardcore pornography, in which coitus. fellatio and cunnilingus actually take place and are graphically displayed and are often enhanced for the viewer.

Candida Royalle's The Gift, is one of the latter in which actual sex with penetration is shown. It is X rated. Many reviewers on the other Candida Royalle movies seem to think Candida's movies are too tame. Since they are the most explicit films available on Amazon, I suggest that they are looking for the right thing but in the wrong place.

There are many sites where the standard XXX fare is offered but from my experience ladies, at least classy ladies do not like the standard XXX fare, which usually demean and abuse women and get into deviant sex.

Candida's films are in a more romantic setting and there is no frantic pace to get as much sex into forty minutes as possible.

That being said, The Gift, for me, was a little too slow. Almost  half the movie was over before there were any sex scenes and there were only two.

Candida Royalle's One Size Fits, was the first I had viewed and to date the best of the five I have seen to date.",1136160000,35,1500,4.724137931034483
