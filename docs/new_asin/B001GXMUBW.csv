8307377,3,B001GXMUBW,"For the record I would like to say I am not friends with any of these dancers, nor do I know any of them personally.  Also, I did not get this dvd for free as many have. I did not purchase this dvd, as I watched it during a sewing party last weekend.

All nine performances were good.  Some of the same dancers from the previous videos (Michelle, Sandra, Nanna, Shoshanna....).  I would have liked to see more new faces and a little more variety.  Also, I feel $25 is a bit too much to watch nine performances that are probably all on youtube, but maybe I'd feel differently if I had a job and money.  Overall, I'm glad Michelle is making good belly dance dvds.",1232928000,3,661,4.2063492063492065
8307378,5,B001GXMUBW,"I love this whole series! I can't seem to go wrong ordering any of the ""By Dancers For Dancers"" projects. I do like the fact that although the performers are not all exactly in the same professional ranking...they all offer something to learn from each performance. Count me in on future offerings!",1232841600,3,298,4.75
