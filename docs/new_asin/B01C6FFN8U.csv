7672559,4,B01C6FFN8U,I gave it a 4 star rating because I feel like behind the scenes footage should've been added as well as cast interviews. It's all good though. I just wish I knew the price would go down from $144 so I didn't have to pay so much. Jesus! Lol but I'm glad I got my #1 favorite TV show on DVD.,1460419200,,289,3.7540983606557377
7672560,4,B01C6FFN8U,"Praise the Lord this is finally out. I was going to put a Youtube Video about this as well, but for now, I will write a review on here.
I ordered my set from VEI's website, it was cheaper and it came very quickly. I am now on Disc three of Season Three and I am having no troubles with audio syncing or volume.

Here are some things that I am noticing thus far:

The BOX SET ITSELF: There is a case for Season's 1-2 and and bigger case for Season's 3-5. The advertisements looks as if there is a case for each season.

Musical Performances Cuts:
 * These could have been due to licensing issues.

So Plush - ""Damn"" ( Big is Beautiful) Season 1
Donnie McClurkin - ""Stand"" ( A Joyful Noise) Season 3

The Donnie McClurkin cut made absolutely no sense. After Nikki gets done praying asking for help for the choir, she is suppose to hear Donnie singing as he is mopping the floor. Then she talk to him about joining the choir. It was a clean transition, not a CUT TO, but it made absolutely no sense. That was unfortunate.

There was also no ending bloopers or ending music for 'A Joyful Noise' (Season 3). Which was weird but I couldn't remember if when it aired on tv if there was any bloopers at all.

I think besides those two episodes that I pointed out, every episode is full to it's entirety. There are somethings networks skipped over when airing the episodes. This is AWESOME!

I will continue to keep watching and update as I find more issues.  If you have questions comment on here and and I'll do my best to answer your questions.",1459555200,18,1538,4.272413793103448
7672561,5,B01C6FFN8U,Loved this show.  I was a fan of Countess Vaughn as Kim on Moesha and was glad to know her career would continue to prosper after Moesha was cancelled. Countess is very talented as both an actress and singer. Would love to purchase the whole set when the price goes down; glad to know im not the only one taken back by the price. ...,1458864000,3,333,4.123076923076923
7672562,2,B01C6FFN8U,"I like this show too, but Amazon isn't going to sell very many at $144. When it drops to $75 or less, I might buy it.",1458777600,4,117,3.5384615384615383

7672566,5,B01C6FFN8U,So extremely happy about this! The Parkers is one of my all time favorite shows! I gave up on them making it on dvd because it had been so many years. I'm disappointed that it's $144.00 though. That's way too much.,1457049600,15,214,4.2439024390243905
7672567,5,B01C6FFN8U,Yes finally another great sitcom is getting a chance at a release which is about time cause The Parkers is considered one of the best sitcoms of its time...I really loved the mother daughter chemistry between Monique and Countess that help make the show so funny and entertaining...I hope the company releases more of the shows from UPN or WB that weren't given dvd releases or complete releases would love for some company to go through the catalog and release them.....,1456358400,5,471,4.827160493827161
7672568,1,B01C6FFN8U,Two things wrong with this DVD set one the picture quality is not good and two it's not closed  captioned and one other thing they packed so many episodes to one dvd like eight to nine per dvd guess that's why the quality is really poor looks like when you have no cable and it's being watched on a busted tv,1527206400,,308,4.049180327868853

7672607,4,B01C6FFN8U,"Almost done with the whole series. I did notice that on Season 4 Episode 19 ""Amazing Grace"" there is a big chunk that was skipped over. The part where everyone thinks Nikki is crazy and then Grace comes into the church singing and everyone can now see her is gone. It goes from everyone calling Nikki crazy while in the church to the very end of the episode where Nikki, Grace, and Kim walk into Nikki's apartment. Other than that I haven't had any issues.",1486339200,6,456,4.376470588235295

7672609,4,B01C6FFN8U,"It's great that The Parkers is finally on DVD.  but i had to knock off a star due to the fact that a few episodes had to be edited for copyright issues

for example, gospel singer Donnie McClurkin is in a season 3 episode where he plays a janitor at Nikki's church. Nikki over hears him singing as she prays to god to give her a sign and then asks him to join her choir. They had to not only edit that scene to remove his singing but also edit the credits at the end and just re-dub the credits over a black screen. Losing that scene kind of messed up the story line.

Also, the episodes that guest starred Lil Zane (season 3), So Plush (season 1) were edited for their musical content.

Also, there are no captions or subtitles.

but still about 95% of the series is uncut and it's still a great buy",1485820800,3,800,4.102564102564102

With the garbage that's on TV now and the older shows they do have in syndication being cut down to 15 minutes just to increase the stations ad revenue buying box sets of your favorite shows are the only way to bring back nostalgia and good family television.,1483228800,,450,4.369047619047619

What a great comedy series with a great cast and great writers who write very funny lines for the actors. Of course the actors have to execute the lines successfully with a great delivery of humor, body language, facial expressions and timing and ""They Do It So Well."" Really love Mo'Nique & Countess as mother & daughter on this show, what an awesome comedy duet, just absolutely great to watch these two perform together or separately. Dorien Wilson is great as the professor and the rest of the supporting cast could also hold their own. Just a great show and I am so glad I was finally able to purchase this 5-season DVD collection!!

Although I know the price is kind of ridiculous but I have amazon prime so I was able to buy it for 69.99 so I also recommend getting amazon prime for 99 dollars a year because they have a lot of great deals. I also got Sister Sister for around the same price. Sooo worth it.,1462579200,4,540,4.252427184466019
7672653,5,B01C6FFN8U,"The Parkers was a sitcom that aired from 1999 - 2004 that starred Countess Vaughn and Mo'Nique as Kim and Nikki Parker. The Kim Parker character was featured on Moesha for its first four seasons. The Parkers was a spinoff that featured Kim and her mother Nikki entering Santa Monica Jr College to obtain their respective education degrees. Nikki is serious about obtaining her degree, especially since she had to dropout of college earlier in her life to give birth to Kim. She makes the most out of her second chance, however, Kim isn't as studious. The show is funny and Countess and Mo'Nique are great as the title characters. They mix it up with Kim's bestie, Stevie Van Lowe (Jenna Von Oy,) Nikki's BFF Andell Wilkerson (the late Yvette Wilson,) Kim and Stevie's band member and friend Thaddeus ""T"" Radcliffe (Ken L.,) and Professor Stanley Oglevee (Dorien Wilson,) who is the unrequited object of Nikki's affection for most of the series. This disc features all 110 episodes of the series. It really is a good throwback for all who loved the show. It's a little pricey, but it's well worth the buy.",1462579200,5,1104,4.725388601036269
7672654,5,B01C6FFN8U,"I love this show, and I'm so glad it's finally available on DVD. I had been waiting for it to become available on Hulu or Netflix, or anything, because I don't have BET and that's the only place you can catch this show. Glad I have my copy of the show in case they ever stop broadcasting.",1462147200,,288,4.0701754385964914
7672655,5,B01C6FFN8U,I have not started watching it yet but the set looks great and arrived in perfect condition. I did preview each episode and don't see any audio issues like reported earlier. Hopefully this set turns out to be fantastic because this show and Sister Sister have been requested several times over the years to several DVD companies. Finally a company comes out with a product and hopefully the public buys several copies so we can see more of these great shows finally make it to DVD.,1461628800,,481,4.604651162790698
7672656,3,B01C6FFN8U,"While I'm extremely happy this show has finally come to DVD, for the price the packaging needs to be better. I opened it and two discs were flying around inside the case. One of which sustained scratches. Granted they were minor but still, it shouldn't have happened. Also, the cases have a section in them that holds additional DVDs which are very flimsy. They fall right out without effort.",1461196800,6,392,4.695652173913044

8752332,3,B01C6FFN8U,My only issue with this product is that episodes are missing scenes. I'm a big The Parker's fan and it's very apparent when scenes are omitted from episodes. What makes it worse is that some of the missing scenes are good scenes that should not be left out.,1529193600,,257,4.375
