3514413,5,B001CO425W,"Saw the movie and I too couldn't wait for the DVD to come out. Congrats to the writers, Gloria and Bebe. Without words there would be no greatness. Congrats also to Diretor Alex, Producer John and the wonderful actors who made it happen. They worked as a team and came up with a wonderful thriller. The twists and turns in the movie kept me wondering what would happen next!  Just great.",1217462400,4,387,4.450704225352113
3514414,5,B001CO425W,"I was invited to the theatrical premiere of this film last year and have been chomping at the bit waiting to get my hands on a DVD. The audience at the premiere gave it a standing ovation!

As with any film, if the script isn't good, the film won't be very good. The writing for ""Things You Don't Tell"" is exceptional. Additionally, the Director, Alex Melli, did an outstanding job and drew excellent performances from the actors.

Encourage all of your friends to buy the DVD.",1217462400,6,477,4.534883720930233

8288338,4,B001CO425W,"Things You Don't Tell is divided into three stories.  In the beginning, with the first story and the way the characters spoke, my impression was that I'm about to watch a low budget drama suitable for the Lifetime Movie Network.  And in fact, the entire first story doesn't really get interesting or suspenseful ever.  But by the second story -especially the second half of the second story- and *definitely* by the third story, suspense city baby!

All three stories tie together in a creative way.  Let's me explain them.  Warning- SPOILERS!

In the first story we see a blonde-haired man dating a woman.  He's cheating on his wife with this woman.  She gets tired of it eventually- tired of the lies, the secrets, the hiding.  She wants him to ditch his wife and be with her.  She has a father who really dislikes this man.  He suspects this guy's a scumbag and well, it certainly seems that way for now.  I should note we never actually see the wife- just the mistress.

Anyway near the end of the story a couple men break into the woman's home, beat her up and send her to the hospital.  The cheater husband/boyfriend feels responsible since he should've been there to protect her.  He visits his girlfriend in the hospital much to the dissatisfaction of the angry father who demands he stay away.  The story ends when the cheater husband walks into the flower shop where his girlfriend works, hands her divorce papers and... end of story.  Well not quite!  I better add this next part!

While the cheater husband's on the boardwalk with his girlfriend, another man walking on the sand below notices and runs after the cheater husband, prompting the boyfriend/girlfriend to run to their car and take off quickly.  A lot of thoughts went through my head during this scene.  ""Is this guy a friend of the wife and notices the husband's cheating on her with another woman, so he wants to confront the husband about it?""  ""Maybe this man's a secret boyfriend of the cheater husband's girlfriend?""  Hey that'd be a twist!  ""Maybe the cheater husband is such a scumbag, he owes this guy money, didn't pay up and now he's after him!""  This last one would make the most sense.  So many thoughts.  I liked this scene a lot.  It kept me wondering!

Story two begins with a mother walking around town with her young daughter and son.  They have food and it seems like a typical day out with the kids.  She seems normal until the daughter sees her mother throw her medication in the trash.  The daughter gets concerned.  We don't know why she needs her medication just yet, but we find out soon enough!  The mother takes her kids back to the hotel room and lets them outside to swim in the pool.  Suddenly when the mother looks out the window she sees a man approach the daughter.  The daughter doesn't acknowledge this man's presence even though he's right behind her and talking.  Know why?  Because he's the mother's hallucination, hence the reason she needs medication.  Then again I'm not 100% sure he's a hallucination!  Unintentional, but the low budget quality of this movie makes it hard to tell if the guy's a hallucination or really there.  Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.  Anyway this man is an important character in the movie.

The mother grows very protective of her children after this by locking them in the hotel room, her car and even the bathroom on one occasion.  Basically anywhere the mother goes, she feels the need to lock her kids up so the man doesn't kidnap them.  Yeah... you're not supposed to keep your kids locked up like that!  You could get into big trouble!  The daughter grows increasingly worried since she detects her mother isn't right in the head.  One night the daughter sneaks into her mom's pocketbook and tries to take something (I think she was looking for a phone and trying to call the cops) but mom wakes up and sees what her daughter's doing.  The daughter says she just wanted a mint but... no!  Mom knows better than to believe such a blatant lie.

Mom does something mean, and if you like the movie Mommie Dearest this is right up your alley.  She cuts her daughters hair while she's asleep.  When the daughter wakes up the next day she's upset mom cut her hair.  Interesting she immediately thought mom cut her hair and not her pesky brother.  They're not exactly the happiest brother and sister pair!  Meanwhile mom changed her hairstyle and look.  Now it's obvious the mother needs help.  The daughter should've grabbed that medication bottle in the trashcan!

Now the daughter tries harder than ever to get away from her mother.  She tries calling for help any chance she can, including sneaking away from her mother at the convenience store to use the phone and even sneaking into the closet at the hotel room where a cord phone is sitting.  This plan backfires as the daughter forgets to put the chair back in place (she needed a chair to climb to the phone).  The mother walks out the bathroom and sees it.  Oops!  Mom's finally had enough and tries to put rat poison in her kid's pizza.  Before the kids have a chance to eat it the cops break through the hotel room and arrest the woman.  Turns out these kids were actually kidnapped the whole time!  She wasn't their mom at all!  Wow!  Clever way of writing the story.

The final story is the most confusing but does tie everything together.... and I mean *everything*.  We see a demented troubled teenager.  He likes being angry and tormenting people.  He visits a psychiatrist but he's unable to help the kid.  No medication works.  The teen eventually refuses medication by chewing up the prescription paper and spitting it out.  The teen likes to beat up sinful women, and we find out he's the one who broke into the house and beat up the girlfriend in the first story.  He's also the little brother in the second story since that whole event happened in the past.  The man the mother was hallucinating in story 2 is actually the teen's no good scumbag of an abusive father.

The teen grew up with severe anger as a result of his father.  He doesn't even trust his closest friend.  While discussing cars and tattoos in a garage, the message is clear that this demented teen can't trust his friend and this leads to more outbursts later on.  He continues to beat up on women.  Earlier he beats on a couple basketball players who kinda had it coming given how ignorant they were towards him for no reason.

SPOILER time!  This teen is the brother of the demented mother from story 2.  The mother from story 2 is the wife of the cheater husband from story 1.  We never see the wife and now I know why!  Showing the wife would've spoiled everything!  Now do you get it?  Because I don't!  Ah... I'm only kidding a little bit there, hehe.  It's rather complex and hard to grasp it all.  I think I'm making a mistake somewhere here though.  Does it make sense this angry teen is the kid we see in story 2 with the abusive father.. but the kid's mother from story 2 is this disturbed teens sister?  Can that be true?  If it is true, then *both* the brother and sister are mentally messed up!  The sister has hallucinations while the brother is just angry, short-tempered and psychotic.  Uh...  Yeah, something doesn't add up but I'm too confused to try and figure it out.

Anyway this teen is the guy on the sand who ran after the husband in story 1.  He wants to kill the husband for cheating on his sister.  This leads to a torture scene at the end involving the cheater husband and his sinful girlfriend.  I won't say what happens, but there is a really graphic gunshot and killing, as well as the threat of burning chained bodies inside a garage.  That's all I'll say.  I won't say what happens to the cheater husband or the teen!  It's hilarious in one scene when the teen aims his gun *right* at the cheater husband but somehow misses thanks to a tricky camera angle, lol.

The acting is really bad and the film is definitely on the low quality side.  It looks like it was recorded using home equipment instead of fancier, better quality cameras found in Hollywood.  But the story... my goodness that story!  It *alone* elevates the amazon rating a few stars.  Awesome job movie writers.  You did it!",1497398400,,8212,4.536568694463432
8288339,1,B001CO425W,Why is this something that exists on this Earth it looked like watching a handicam video at home with family but not in a found footage way. Stop the madness!!,1487808000,,159,4.333333333333333
8288340,1,B001CO425W,"A line in the trailer mentions, ""sometimes you pretend it's working because the truth is too painful."" How prophetic that turned out to be. Because it's clear that everyone involved in this travesty ignored the painful truth and continued. The result is almost beyond words how bad this is.

I've seen a lot of low budget movies with inexperienced actors and, obviously, some are handled better than others. Most are pretty bad but have some redeeming qualities - cinematography...or a single actor that stands out...even something as simple as a set design or location. This had absolutely zero redeeming qualities.

This project tried so hard pretending to be a real movie that it was embarrassing. I should have realized how awful it would be when person doing the voiceover for the Trailer was trying to sound like Don LaFontaine, the famous movie voiceover guy. I can actually picture the creator/director/writer instructing him, ""No no...try to make your voice really deep like that famous guy...more mysterious and scary...""

It was comical right from the start and only got worse.

Sometimes when personal projects are funded by friends and family...and not studios and investors who actually expect a quality product for their investment, you can get a diamond in the rough. More often, you get a self-serving piece of drivel with embarrassingly bad actors, writing, directing, editing and camera work.

Just think of those American Idol contestants who think they can sing. You know, the ones who make the bloopers reel. They walk up to the audition stage and belt out their lyrics. The judges cringe and terminate the audition within seconds and respond, ""Dude/Honey...you really can't sing at all. You're terrible. Find another line of work."" They get defensive and hurt (and often shocked) ""But...but...but...all my friends and family, and all those people at the karaoke bar, said I was great! What do you know!?""

That was this project. A blooper reel where those close to the creator felt too bad to be honest and explain how utterly awful it was.",1482710400,,2063,5.052941176470588
