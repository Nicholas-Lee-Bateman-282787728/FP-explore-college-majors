8129573,4,B000G8NZ9E,"The Vanity Serum is kind of odd in that it's determined to be a mystery movie but also comedy, a statement on culture, and a Fellini style spectacle all at once filtered through a Dario Argento giallo lense, which for those not in the know he's the reason stuff like Seven with Brad Pitt exists. It's not entirely successful but it's entertaining and has so much forward momentum that you can't stop long enough to notice the many many holes. A sign of a good thriller or mystery film is that you're not angry about the movie being nonsense while you're watching it. I'd prefer fair play but I'd prefer to be entertained more.

The story is about two cops who are, of course, both troubled. They're trying to find an author who has been kidnapped. Along the way, they run into a bunch of increasingly odd people like a ostrich farmer, a reality TV show host, a repressed gay critic who is played for laughs, and a villain so goofy that the film had to make 12 more left turns to help them make sense. I mean all this as a compliment. It all works well enough while watching it and the camera work and cinematography are good and set the mood well.

I don't think this is great art or deserved the final left turn that it took at the end but it's ambitious and fun. As I said before, I prefer to be entertained.",1449878400,,1310,4.299595141700405
