7576307,5,B019KDXAQS,"Labyrinth of Lies is set in Germany in 1958. Attorney Johann Radmann (Alexander Fehling) takes the case of a Jew who recognized one of his former concentration camp guards on the street. None of the other prosecutors will touch the case. Germany and its populace were eager to put World War II behind them. Many Germans could plausibly claim ignorance to both war crimes and national culpability. Radmanns investigation would only reopen old wounds. Against the wishes of his immediate superior, he begins to examine the case, but soon encounters a web of repression and denial. He devotes himself to his new task, overstepping boundaries, falling out with friends and colleagues, and being drawn deeper and deeper into a myriad of lies and guilt in search for the truth.

As he interviews survivors of the Holocaust, he begins to focus on Auschwitz, and in particular Dr. Josef Mengele, who conducted torture experiments on women and children at the camp. But Nazis like Mengele are well-protected in powerful circles.

As we watch events unfold through the eyes of Radmann, the horrors of crimes committed against innocent civilians overwhelm him and he becomes obsessed with seeing Nazis hiding everywhere. This seems a contrivance in an otherwise exceptional film. Perhaps director Giulio Ricciarelli was attempting to show how the extent of inhumanity was too devastating to grasp.

The movie is set between the end of World War II and the 1960 capture and eventual trial of former Nazi SS officer Adolf Eichmann. It reflects a time when not only Germans, but survivors of the camps wanted to move on with their lives and forget the nightmare to which they had been subjected. Radmanns unpopular efforts and resolve to get to the truth brought to light heinous war crimes.

Special features on the Blu-ray release include commentary with director Giulio Ricciarelli and actor Alexander Fehling; Q & A at the LA Jewish Film Festival with Ricciarelli and Fehling; and deleted scenes.",1455321600,46,1986,5.064220183486238
7576308,5,B019KDXAQS,"LABYRINTH OF LIES s is an engrossing post-Holocaust drama that, with the exception of employing a fictional hero (actually a composite of three real people) and heroine, is based on fact.

Germany, 1958:  The war has been over for more than a decade, and some citizens have never heard of, while others want to forget, the word, Auschwitz.  Going against the will of his immediate superior, a young German prosecutor (Alexander Fehling) begins to examine the case of a teacher who was once a guard at the death camp.  As he takes testimony from camp survivors and more facts of atrocities come to light, the idealistic attorney must not only deal with people in authority who impede his quest for justice, but he also discovers information about his own family that will change his life, as well as his country, forever.

Director Giulio Ricciarelli has delivered a powerful, well-made film that centers on an aspect of post-war Germany of which most modern audiences are unaware.  Indeed, in a Q&A with Ricciarelli and Fehling that is one of the extras on the Blu-ray disc, the director discloses that there were certain facts that he could not reveal because they would have been too embarrassing to the German government.

LABYRINTH OF LIES was filmed on German (with both English and French subtitles).  Released onto home video by Sony Pictures Classics, the disc also features audio commentary by the director and star, as well as several deleted scenes.

7576319,4,B019KDXAQS,"- although I suppose that was intentional, to show the repressed nature of postwar West Germany, as well as the anally-clean settings and attire (West Germany didn't scrub all the public war-grunge until the mid-60s.)  As a Holocaust courtroom film it lags behind the more recent ""Denial,"" and is left in the distance by the classic ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" precisely because of this passionless portrayal.  Even where emotions erupt to the surface it seems forced, like a German call to duty.

But this film does portray the willful amnesia of postwar Deutschland uber alles, even one's own memory and conscience. Our righteous protagonist, faced with the choice of pursuing truth and justice or accommodating himself to relationships with the real people of his world, chooses the former. It was also fitting that his country's dilemma was brought home to him personally, through revelations of his own background.  Contrast this repressed society with the fervent Communist witch-hunting of the unified Federal Republic.  Something, huh?  No chipped souvenirs of Dachau were ever sold to eager tourists in Berlin, I'm sure.

Worth a watch as the ""new Germany""-before-last began to come to terms with itself and digest its past.  As we know the process is far from complete; anal repression still blocks a true purging.",1499817600,,1320,5.193396226415095

7576326,5,B019KDXAQS,"Major Parker (Tim Williams). Originally in German in the movie (the American Major speaks German to Johann Radmann): You were all Nazis. In the Eastern sector, now you are all communists. Jesus, you Germans! If little green men from Mars landed tomorrow, you would all become green.

Finally a movie that shows the culpability of the common German people in the Holocaust! The Holocaust didn't happen just because of 4 Nazi psychos, but thanks to millions of ordinary men (90% of the Germans from 1940-41) who supported the Nazi ideology and happily collaborated in the massacres of millions of innocent men, women and children. By the way, two books that brilliantly demonstrate the collaboration of the vast and overwhelming majority of Germans in the gigantic Nazi killing machine are Rethinking the Holocaust, by Yehuda Bauer (a masterpiece) and Hitlers Willing Executioners: Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust, by Daniel Goldhagen.

Im Labyrinth des Schweigens shows the fast oblivion in Germany of the atrocities committed by the Germans just 10 years after the liberation of the Nazi concentration and extermination camps, and the impunity millions of murderers enjoyed, people who tortured, massacred and gassed millions of Jews and non-Jews in the 1940s. Only very few Germans heard about Auschwitz before the famous Eichmann trial in 1961.

Im Labyrinth des Schweigens focuses on the the period prior to the trials that took place in Frankfurt between December 20, 1963 and August, 1965 (called in German der Auschwitz-Prozess) against very few SS members who operated in Auschwitz. The trials were ridiculous and a spit on the 1,100,000 victims who were massacred and gassed in Auschwitz. From the 7,000 SS members who operated in Auschwitz during the war, only 22 dogs were judged at the Frankfurt Trials. Nevertheless, the attempt for a pinch of justice was important. From the 22 SS members, only 6 got life imprisonment, many got ridiculous sentences ranging from 3 to 10 years, and 5 were simply released.

Im Labyrinth des Schweigens shows the extreme difficulty of judging the murderers because of the silence the Germans kept and their attempt to hide the truth.

Im Labyrinth des Schweigens got many prizes (although none were extremely important) and it was the film that Germany presented for the category Best Foreign Language Film (Oscars, 2016), although it was not nominated.

I always believed that the only way Germans (and Austrians) have today to clean the blood their parents and grandparents spilled is to be deeply anti-Nazi. But how many Germans and Austrians are there today who are deeply anti-Nazi?

Schweigen is silence in German. The correct translation of the title would be: In the Labyrinth of Silence. In English the title has been poorly translated as Labyrinth of Lies.

The best: the fact that the culpability of the German common pig in the Holocaust finally arouses.

The worst: that even when the film shows Fritz Bauer (the judge who made the Frankfurt Trials possible), the character of Johann Radmann (brilliantly performed by Alexander Fehling) is fictitious.",1482624000,,3112,5.170974155069582

It is extremely well done.  It drew me in and kept me captivated throughout.  One reviewer knocked off a star for the German with English subtitles, so a little history lesson for the insular-minded watcher:  WWII concentration camp detainees were from non-English-speaking European countries.  Auschwitz was in Poland, as was Plaszow, the smaller camp depicted in Schindler's List, where English was also not the primary or even secondary language.  Since not all films originate in Hollywood, there should be nothing surprising about a German film based on real events that took place in Germany being in the German language.  I knocked off one star because, although this film is excellent, it does somewhat insulate the viewer from the horrors of the camps.  Even the depicted visit to Auschwitz fails to evoke the grimness of the venue.  Ultimately, this is not a courtroom drama but one of a German investigation that led to convictions for war crimes 20 years after WWII.",1481328000,,1130,5.064864864864865

He encounters a survivor of Auschwitz and a journalist who want to bring the perpetrators of the atrocities that took place there to trial. The problem is that Germany seems to not want to rake over the coals of the past and there are former Nazis everywhere who just don't care.

What follows are the travails he and his friends go through in order to do something, try to build a case and wake the German people from their wilful apathy towards the war. We also have his personal life and that of those around him and who are swept up in the investigation.

This is an extremely well made film, the story is completely gripping and I loved the period detail too. It does not sugar coat what took place but is also not horrific in terms of the graphic abuse that sadly occurred, especially at the hands of Mengele and co.

7576367,5,B019KDXAQS,"An astounding movie that revealed things about post-German society that were completely new to me, a child of the late 1940s and the '50s.
Well organized, perfectly written and feelingly acted. Watching it, I felt like the Italian writer/director Giulio Ricciarelli had opened a secret door to Germany's mostly successful post-war attempts to hide the facts about Nazi Germany from its own citizens, a see-no- hear-no-evil attitude that dominated German life for 15 years after the Nazis lost the war. Up until 1960, the film seems to be charging, Germany was a nation of silent Holocaust deniers.
This is a classic story of a doggedly obsessive young prosecutor who finally discovers and reveals all, in spite of efforts by his colleagues and boss to stop him.
What makes it astounding is the plodding manner in which the director slowly reveals - and the main character discovers - the horror and despair of the Nazi death camps by showing the young prosecutor slowly building his case, banal fact upon banal fact, using the meticulous records that death camp managers kept of every event, every death, each gold tooth, even tracking the cost per death of the gas they used firstly to kill and subsequently to incinerate the remains of those killed, all carefully noted with cool German efficiency in the record books, and stored away in organized office files.
There's plenty of interesting side stories as well - the prosecutor's attempts to capture Dr. Josef Mengele, the butcher of Auschwitz; Mossad's kidnapping of Adolf Eichmann for trial in Israel.
But the core purpose of the movie is to show this one lone prosecutor committed to forcing the German people to recognize and accept the terrible truths about Nazi Germany",1463356800,2,1729,5.006944444444445
7576368,5,B019KDXAQS,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

While many movies have been made about WWII and the Holocaust, few have been made concerning the rebuilding of Germany after the war. There is little doubt that this would have been a fascinating time in history to examine and yet I for one have rarely heard it discussed. Until now. LABYRINTH OF LIES tells the story of what could have been the greatest cover up in history had it not been for several brave individuals who wanted to make sure the truth was told.

Johann Radmann (Alexander Fehling) is a recent addition to the prosecutors office in Frankfurt. The year is 1958 and the war has been over now for 13 years. Given the task of handling minor cases like traffic tickets, Radmann has his curiosity piqued when a journalist confronts the head prosecutor claiming that a man has recognized one of the guards from Auschwitz working as a grade school teacher. Ignored by the head man, Radmann takes it upon himself to talk to Thomas Gnielka (Andre Szymanski), the reporter.

While many of us today know full well what happened at Auschwitz at this time it wasn't common knowledge. Gnielka takes Radmann with him to meet Simon Kirsch, the Auschwitz survivor who gave him this information. As Radmann gets more and more involved in the lives of these two men as well as becoming a part of their circle of friends, he wants to take on this case. But thats where the first impediment comes in as his supervisor wants the case ignored. Fortunately thats not the case with the head of the department, Fritz Bauer (Gert Voss).

A Jew himself, Bauer appoints Radmann the head of the investigation and sets him up with his own secretary and office. Radmann begins to look into Simons claim but finds his path blocked by people in his government as well as U.S. representatives remaining after the occupation. No one wants the truth of Auschwitz to be revealed and they will do anything to keep what happened secret.

With the guiding hand of Bauer to set him on the right path, Radmann begins to uncover the secret history of Auschwitz and what was done by the German people, some just following orders but the more horrendous of the group giving those orders with apparent glee and joy. At the top of his list is Josef Mengele. When Radmann learns that Mengele travels without fear between Germany and his home in South America he is outraged. But it is his focus on Mengele that nearly brings his investigation to a halt.
Only through dogged determination will he find the opportunity to find those behind Auschwitz.

What makes this movie interesting is not the story of Auschwitz itself but the fact that so many were willing to hide this piece of history for what they considered the greater good, the rebuilding of a country already devastated by a war their leaders had created. But can the healing actually take place if the wounds are hidden rather than taken care of? That becomes the central question asked in this film.

Its not just the bureaucrats that attempt to ignore the past either. A side story of Radmann falling in love with a beautiful dress designer who is part of that Bohemian group that Gnielka surrounds himself with ties in with the story as well. While outraged at first when well connected and wealthy bureaucrats and their wives set her up with her own shop and business, she begins to find that she too is caught up in the silence rather than the correction of history. Like most of those who were involved in the war she simply wants to move on and forget about the past no matter how terrible the atrocities were.

Let me say now that if subtitles are not your thing youll probably pass this one by. But if you do you short change yourself from seeing a great movie. Its not a metaphor for current history, its not making a hugely political statement about the world today, its discussing the past and a history that was not just almost forgotten but hidden away under mounds of paperwork and by people who were once involved in those brutal places but now are connected enough with officials that they feel safe.

The movie has a stunning look to it with some beautiful cinematography that could have been found drab but instead feels real. The acting it done so well that even with translation the performances on display here convey the emotions so well that you find yourself wondering from moment to moment what will happen next as well as being involved with each character on screen.

When all is said and done, in what some have found a slightly faulty ending wrapping things up too neatly, you have a compelling story that offers zero dull moments and plenty of drama that will hold your attention from start to finish. For me a great movie is one that I know Ill pull out and watch again. This is one of those movies.",1462752000,6,4817,4.59720605355064

But when one former Nazi is outed as a schoolteacher, a state prosecutor in Frankfurt is spurred to action by a journalist friend.

Labyrinth of Lies deals with a pretty much forgotten chapter in German historythe 1963 Frankfurt Auschwitz trials. State prosecutors in the German city of Frankfurt brought former mid-and-low level functionaries of the Auschwitz death camp to trial despite opposition from Nazi sympathizers and an apathetic public. Perhaps the most surprising thing one learns from the film is just how ignorant the general population was of Auschwitz and the Nazi era when the story begins in 1958.

The protagonist is a composite character, Johann Radmann, based on three real-life prosecutors, played by the popular German actor, Alexander Fehling. When we're first introduced to Radmann, he has a low level job in the prosecutor's officer handling traffic violations. His by-the-book demeanor immediately becomes apparent when he refuses to allow a pretty Fraulein, to pay a reduced fine for a traffic infraction.

Through the efforts of Tomas Gnielka, a journalist obsessed with Germany's embrace of Nazism, Radmann soon gets wind of a former Auschwitz guard now working as a school teacher. Radmann is rebuffed by the lead prosecutor in the office who disparages him for taking an interest in the former Auschwitz guardin the lead prosecutor's view, this will only open up a can of worms. But a higher-up, Fritz Bauerthe Attorney General-- is sympathetic toward efforts to uncover the crimes of the Nazi past, and appoints Radmann as the special prosecutor responsible for prosecuting those responsible for crimes at the death camp.

Radmann gets his first leads from Simon Kirsch, an Auschwitz survivor, introduced to him by Gnielka. Kirsch is uncooperative at first but later, along with other survivors, provides important testimony that will aid Radmann in his quest to bring various Auschwitz functionaries to justice. Radmann also digs up evidence from files at an US Army base. Director Giulio Ricciarelli does well in chronicling the extreme state of denial many Germans were in as they grappled with the legacy of Nazi horrors.

There are also sympathizers who do everything they can (including throwing a rock with a swastika on it, through Radmann's window), to derail him from finishing his job. You would never guess that the actual Auschwitz participants who now have ordinary jobs were stone-cold killers, just a little over a decade before.

Labyrinth of Lies gets bogged down when Radmann becomes obsessed with tracking down the notorious ""Butcher of Auschwitz"", Dr. Josef Mengele, in spite of orders to desist from his boss Bauer. Radmann's efforts to capture Mengele prove fruitless, despite having learned that Mengele has been returning to Germany from South America to visit his relatives. Since we already know that Mengele was never captured, there is very little point in chronicling Radmann's unsuccessful quest for a good part of the second half of the narrative.

Radmann has his ""dark moment"" of the second Act, when he becomes overly self-righteous in holding his fellow Germans to account for their indifference during the Nazi years. It turns out that Gnielka, the fanatically anti-Nazi journalist, was actually a 17 year old worker at the death camp; and Redmann's girlfriend, Marlene, has been making profits in selling clothes to the wives of former Nazis. At one point Radmann quits the prosecutor's office and signs on with a hot-shot attorney but eventually sees the light and agrees to finish his prosecutorial duties.

Labyrinth of Lies is a valuable film in that it paints an indelible portrait of a society coming to grips with its dark past. While not everything works in the film (the Mengele sequence is particularly overdone), the exploration of this largely forgotten chapter in German history, is most welcome.",1459036800,3,3814,5.218954248366013
7576408,5,B019KDXAQS,"A very successful German film in depicting a young lawyer's passion and courage in exposing and bringing to trial ordinary Nazi war criminals that were living normal, everyday lives in post-war West German society. The film effectively shows how German society wanted simply to forget the war and concentrate on rebuilding their nation at the expense of facing responsibility for launching history's most destructive war and murdering millions of innocent men, women, and children in pursuit of implementing the most malign, evil socio-political ideas the world had seen. The film also effectively highlights the bureaucratic hurdles, made all the more difficult by the prevalent war-amnesia, that the protagonist faced. As with many foreign films, the character development is outstanding- these are people you care about, admire, or despise; there is no way you cannot fully engage with the film's characters. Excellent acting all around! I encourage anyone interested in post-WWII West German history or the larger theme of pursuit of moral justice to watch 'Labyrinth of Lies'.",1458518400,5,1081,5.479041916167665

7576422,5,B019KDXAQS,"Wow. This film was just incredible. The complexities of the writing truly depicted the complexities of the circumstances. As an avid history buff who particularly has studied the era of Nazi Germany, I find one of the most neglected story told is that of the German citizens who lived through their country being hijacked by Sadist, fascist, murdering cowards. How did they survive that ordeal and how did they come to terms with their actions to survive, to keep their families safe and how did those generations after learn of what they did and judge it. I felt the casting of lead character/ young idealist attorney, who you cannot look at without being reminded of the physical representation of Hitlers idea of what the master race looked like. A talk, fit, handsome blonde haired, blue eyed man. But his beliefs  stood light years away from the Nazi. The emotions are palpable. This movie was brilliant and the people courageous: survivors and those who fought to tale their experiences. Bravo.",1457568000,9,1000,4.9171597633136095

7576438,5,B019KDXAQS,I did not know that it took Germany until 1963 to begin to prosecute it's war criminals.  The average German up until that time did not even know about Auschwitz.  The prosecution of the few criminals they could find changed the consciousness in that country.  For filling in the gaps of our knowledge makes the film worth viewing.  It was shocking in a way to me and resonates with the lack of prosecution of our own 'war criminals' in our country.,1455753600,10,449,4.506172839506172

8745476,5,B019KDXAQS,"Most Americans,-if they give any thought to Spain's role in World War II,-place Spain alongside Sweden and Switzerland as having stayed neutral. Not so,: as Adam Hochschild reveals in his excellent new history  SPAIN IN OUR HEARTS: Americans in the Spanish Civil War, 1936-1939... Hochschild focusses on the Americans in Spain, either as journalists such as Ernest Hemingway and Martha Gellhorn, or as volunteers for the Republic forces opposing the Franco- led  Nationalists. He also covers in great detail the violent conflict;  a conflict won by the Franco's forces with considerable military support from both Germany and Italy. So much support that Franco proposed Spain entering the conflict  only to be  discouraged by Hitler knowing that Germany would have to supply forces to defend Spain weakened by the three-year civil war. Franco did, however, send a Division of some 8,000 volunteers to join German forces on their Eastern front against Soviet forces. The American State Department labeled Spain a Non-Belligerent rather than  Neutral.
Generalissimo  Franco--with gory details provided by Hochschild- was a brutal,  bloody dictator . The atrocities of Franco's forces shocked foreign journalists, especially the Americans and British. It is not beyond  reason to  believe that had Spain declared war on the side of the Axis,  Franco would have been tried and executed at Nirenberg along with the German war criminals.",1509667200,,1431,5.400900900900901
8745477,4,B019KDXAQS,"I liked this film, although at first glance I thought it was gong to be a documentary.  I thought it was a good drama, being a bit on the heavy side (but not graphic) as it dealt with the conspiracy/cover-up of Nazi crimes during WWII.  Also, buyers should be aware that this is a DVD-R, so make sure that your device can support playback, as there are many that have problems with DVD-R format.",1506384000,,395,4.324324324324325
8745478,5,B019KDXAQS,This is a really good movie. It shows what life was like in Germany during the late 1950s. Germans were struggling with the aftermath of the Third Reich.,1506384000,,153,4.5
8745479,5,B019KDXAQS,"Nowadays it is a crime to deny the Holocaust in Germany, as well as to posess symbols of the Nazi regime. This brillianr movie, however, shows that there was a time, merely 13 years after the end of WWII, when the common german citizen didn't know what the name Auschwitz meant, or believed that death camps were merely propaganda from the victorious allied forces. It also shows that the de-nazification process either was a complete fake or ended way before it should, probably in part as the result of the cold war and the existance of a new enemy, the soviet communists. Many former Nazis were in important positions in West Germany and did what they could to avoid the investigations shown in the movie. And what is worse, many people who were not war criminals themselves really thought that these criminals should not be bothered. That everyone in the country was ""coerced"" by Hitler and should not be accounted for their actions, when now we know that most wilingly embraced Hitler's madness. And most of all, it shows that just one person can make a difference and make the world better, when we still have our moral compass.",1501977600,3,1134,4.703517587939698
8745480,5,B019KDXAQS,"This movie was one I wanted to see for awhile. It was way beyond what I thought it was going to be. The movie plot is driven very well by the main character motive to find the truth and exposed what is hidden. The movie at times is a little slow but it made up by the detail of events explained. I would suggest this movie to people who have a interest in history and drama. P.S---This movie is in German and has english subtitles, there is NO only English version.",1500508800,,465,4.1208791208791204
