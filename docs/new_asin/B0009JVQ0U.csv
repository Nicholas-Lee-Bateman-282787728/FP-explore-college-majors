8062096,3,B0009JVQ0U,"RRRrrrr!!! is a French caveman comedy (set in the 'Stan Age' - at least in the English subtitles on the Thai DVD - when everyone is called Stan because they haven't got round to inventing any new names yet) that is either stupidly enjoyable or enjoyably stupid (or just plain stupid) depending on your mood. There's not much in the way of plot, revolving around a 800 year fight between the Clean Hairs and the Dirty Hairs over the secret of shampoo that gets sidelined when the world's first murder is committed, but that's just an excuse for a series of spot gags along the lines of a Tex Avery or Looney Tunes cartoon.

As usual with French comedy there's a tendency to find cold-blooded murder extremely amusing (some French comedies end in massacres that even Peckinpah might think was over the top) that doesn't always translate, but there are more than enough good gags, both visual and verbal, to compensate.

The French PAL DVD is English friendly, in the original 2.35:1 widescreen ratio with English subtitles (a 2-disc version is available with deleted scenes, featurettes and outtakes, none of which are subtitled), while the Thai PAL DVD is fullframe with French soundtrack and a different English subtitle translation.",1284076800,2,1233,4.894736842105263
