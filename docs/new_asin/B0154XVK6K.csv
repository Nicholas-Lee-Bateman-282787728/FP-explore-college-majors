7428871,4,B0154XVK6K,"A Christmas Carol meets Clueless in this thoughtful little Holiday gem with ex Superman star Dean Cain. Modern day re-imagining of Dickens' classic story about an unruly character (in this case, a spoiled Beverly Hills rich kid) who, through a series of inexplicable events, redeems herself by helping others and learning that the greatest gift in life is just to love and be loved in return. What I like about these end-of-year Christmas movies is that they are more concerned with their viewing audience than their critics. Beverly Hills Christmas (2015) is one of those great little movies you can just watch with the family without fretting about awkward, inappropriate moments that may come up during the film. There were some wonderful performances (especially from the housekeeper) and some pretty dramatic moments involving a character slipping into mortal coil, then back again, but the overall tone and feel of this film is totally 'feel good'. It was interesting to see screen actor John Savage in here (playing an elderly resident) in a very comical/heartfelt role. Overall, much better than your average Holiday movie with a pretty relevant message at its core.",1448582400,4,1174,5.151832460732984
7428872,5,B0154XVK6K,"Even it is a B-Movie- nice story and good to watch on a rainy day with your beloved friends and it has a really touching message. Natural acting, and I am looking forward to see part two!",1448582400,6,187,4.081081081081081

7428874,5,B0154XVK6K,I loved the message that the most important things in life are not material and I enjoyed the characters. The dog was adorable! Not only was the movie very mystical in its wonderful heaven to earth connection but also in the warm hearted outcome of the overall feeling of the relationship of all those who participated in really this very special movie. I thought both the characters Ravin and Lucille were especially important in bringing all aspects together to produce this heartfelt experience.,1448409600,4,498,5.0120481927710845
7428875,5,B0154XVK6K,"A  Beverly Hills Christmas -Beautiful Story.-- Highly recommend it..

In this movie we first see Angelina(Donna Spangler) a powerful fashion designer

in LA during the holidays.  She forgets to have the Christmas spirit and

that evening in her Bentley she is in a  tragic accident. She then goes to the after life. Which is Malibu that is captured beautiful by a great DP. There she  meets the handsome Dean Cain (Angel Gabriel) who hints  that she needs to fix something in a person's life.  It is actually her spoiled daughter Ravin in Beverly Hills.  The story pays tribute to many classic holidays movies. The basis of the story is about redemption and being conscious about the

importance of others and  not  to be  to driven by material goods.  There are many stand out great performances. Lucille(Mara Rydell) the physic housekeeper who can  hear the voice on Angelina as an apparition ala  GHOST(1990) has an a great scene at the hospital about home compassionate a certain someone was in her life.  Also Vincent De Paul who plays the affluent kind hearted Dad James Foxworth gives a great depiction of a Beverly Hills' father  with a balance of Steve Martin humor then at the end gives a performance about the loss of his wife and mother to Ravin.  It is filled with hands down the most honest work I have seen in any holiday film. De Paul speaks from the heart and really has a classic way about him that is reminiscent to Robert Redford or Paul Neuman. Now the teen story that hits home with me was so well done.(I have been dealing with the complexity of raising two teenagers.) Ravin Spangler and Brandon Tyler Russell play star crossed lovers from different sides of the tracks.  One rich the other poor.  The ebb and  flow of their performance was a joy to watch. I know I will be  seeing more of them in up coming features.  They simply have a great conversational way about what plights they are in and what they should do about it.  Very nice.  Kirsten Lean (Carol Foxworth) plays a great step mom that is not your typical hateful monster. She plays it with subtle jokes and does really resonate as a voice of reason to her adopted daughter Ravin. Lea and her environment felt like a natural fit.  Brian Skiba the masterful director and writer is know for these holiday movies that at the core of the script are about real people in real situations with a touch of magic.  I love watching his movies each year during the holiday as an escape from the day to day news of ISIS.  THEY ARE FUN!!!

I am no Siskel and Ebert but I related to very well to this movie. The real story of woman struggling in the
work force to achieve their place in a male dominated world.  Donna Spangler is just beautiful and does a great job  playing a GLAMAROUS working mother of the Rodeo Drive set. This movie  was empowering to me and will be to many folks.  5 STARS",1448409600,5,2867,4.49031007751938
7428876,1,B0154XVK6K,"I have reviewed hundreds of movies but this I have to say is my first bad review  so it has to be pretty bad for me to actually rate it as bad. I try to be fair and consider all factors. The story idea was a decent one but the acting was so bad.  I was surprised to see Dean Cain and John Savage in this movie. I realize the director, producer, etc. wanted to make a movie about a spoiled teenager mending her ways and have a moral to the story  and maybe these long time great actors wanted to be a part of that. Lucille, the housekeeper, was good too, but the others unfortunately, could not act.  If they want to do more acting jobs I suggest they work on their acting skills, please take some acting classes.",1448323200,5,712,4.064285714285714

7429012,1,B0154XVK6K,"I have seen ALOT of movies in my time and though I'm not exactly a professional movie critic I can with 100% honesty day that this is the absolute WORST movie I have ever seen. It's like they all just got their scripts and filmed the movie while reading their lines for the first time. I actually thought it was some sort of joke or a spoof on the classic Christmas story. I actually feel bad for everyone involved in the making of this movie, they never saw what hit them. Someone should have told them how bad it was before letting it go on the air. I keep expecting something to come out about how this was really put together for a grade school theater project and all these e list actors agreed to do it pro bono in the spirit of Christmas... At least that would make more sense... Really? I mean... Really? It isn't just the actors either... I'm still not sure if this was a spoof, a comedy, a drama, or a grade school skit. That dog was dang cute though. That CPR would not have saved anyone, and how realistic is it too have your heart attack victim just get up and continue on with his day d if nothing happened, where were the paramedics, and why was the dramatic scene at the hospital turned into an odd comedic scene? I'm rambling... No clear thoughts in my head... Or in that movie.
I do wish marketers and friends would not lie so heavily in these ratings, no need to go on about how terrible it was like I did but maybe some constructive criticism would be helpful. These actors really need to know what they should be working on if they are every going to be any good... And I truly hope they all continue to work hard, get better, and one day realize their dreams. They can't do that if ppl are telling them how great they are when they aren't even yet mediocre, its not fair to them...or to those who are about to spend money on this movie.",1449619200,3,1858,4.22191011235955

7429024,5,B0154XVK6K,"A Beverly Hills Christmas is a classic feel good movie. You review is a bit off. Firstly, you are a male and you have no idea what you are talking about. Angelina Foxworth is a career minded woman in a man's world. She is NOT mean spirited. She is motivated and directed. If a man acted like her being the CEO of his own company ala Steve Jobs, Donald Trump -- he would be applauded for his corporate savvy ness. I watched the movie and loved Angelina and her ethereal acting. Mrs. Foxwoth is the owner of Jetson. A billion dollar fashion house company of woman's gowns. While building the trendy company she helped folks like her assistant Lucille(Mara Rydell.(by the way gives a beautiful and emotional speech at the end of the movie (spoiler alert.) ) Donna Spangler's angel scenes are breathtaking in Malibu. She handles playing DEAD pretty beautifully. Now about the father, James Bennet Foxworth (Vincent De Paul) happens to been the most charming man I have seen in a long time in these holiday films. So you know most men and husbands are beyond void of emotion. I am waiting to get my husband to act beyond scratching his ?? and seeing further than his newspaper to even check on the kids. De Paul plays a grieving husband and Beverly Hills dad with CLASS and restrained dignity. Very natural and very believable. And by the way, his looks on camera are very handsome which was appealing to me maybe not YOU. Also, De Paul's natural way about him when he checks on his family and kisses his wife in the middle of the night in the mansion made me swoon. He is very convincing as a real Dad dealing with the real situations. Such a tremendous loss and rearing a 14 year daughter with his second wife he tackles effortlessly. I felt his pain. I was thoroughly convinced he loved his wife in the hospital scene when he speaks to Ravin at the end... Re watch it!!!!

I do agree with your opinion about Dean Cain (Angel Gabriel). He is always remarkable and I enjoyed watching him giving counsel, guidance, and enlightenment to Angelina. Cain encourages her to change the trajectory of her daughter's poor life choices. Kirsten Lea (Carol) really shows compassion as a step mom and was perfect in the role. Also Brandon Tyler Russell (Jerry)and Ravin Spangler (Ravin) and so right for each other we first see it in the first act. They were spot on in their development of their characters and delivery. YES they are an integral part of the movie and the collective importance in the plot of A Beverly Hills Christmas. You may want to talk to the DVD designer on why they left off pictures of them. For some reason middle America responds to doggies on covers of DVD box art. Great performances also by Andy Cohen (Very funny) Simona Fusco, John Savage (Touching) and Seth Menachem & Sara Phillips(Moving performance as parents of Jerry).

Anthony, Just so you know this is a holiday movie that dares to address some issues folks deal with everyday. I feel the director Brian Skiba did a tremendous job of showing three dimensional people. Also pleased Skiba added humorous fun and loving moments not to take it self to seriously. ENJOYED IT!!!",1449014400,2,3146,4.616071428571429
7429025,1,B0154XVK6K,Poor acting.  Do not waste your money!,1448928000,3,38,4.428571428571429
7429026,2,B0154XVK6K,"The concept of Beverly Hills Christmas is a classic: rich but mean-spirited corporate executive dies unexpectedly and is given the chance to return to Earth as a guardian angel for her equally-mean-spirited rich spoiled teenage daughter, with the hope of a happy ending for dead and living alike. I was looking forward to a new take on that trope. Unfortunately, the execution doesnt live up to the potential.

Donna Spangler overacts her way through the role of Angelina, the ghost/guardian angel; her ruthless corporate executive moments are whiney rather than cold, her guardian angel scenes are hammy, and her car-crash death-scene scream actually made me laugh out loud. On the other side of the scale, Vincent DePauls performance as James, the husband left behind to raise their daughter, is incredibly stiff and unconvincing. Kirsten Lea as Angelinas former assistant / James new wife Carol is a braying and cloying plot device more than a character.  Of the adult leads, only Dean Cain comes off as at all realistic  and hes playing the archangel Gabriel as Heavens lobby greeter.

The teenage leads fare better. Ravin Spangler as spoiled-rich-girl Ravin starts out a bit wooden but warms up as the movie progresses  her tantrums get more convincing and her change-of-heart works very well. For what seems to be her first movie, she handles herself well. But Brandon Tyler Russell as Jerry, the kid who has been tossed through the foster-care system and still has a giving and kind attitude, provides the film with its heart. His delivery is natural regardless of whether hes being funny, supportive or pained and thus Russells character is virtually the only one in the film that has any depth. Because of this, the Jerry/Ravin scenes are the most natural in the movie  so its a good thing most of the second half of the movie is centered on them. (The back cover of the DVD and the IMDb page for this movie make it seem that Russell is barely in the film, but hes as much of a lead as DePaul and Lea , and more so than Cain, in terms of plot importance and screen time.)

Brian Skibas direction has heart but cant seem to decide what it wants the movie to be. There are some extremely odd, almost slapstick-humor moments that crop up in awkward places. For instance: in a serious hospital scene near the end of the movie, various pieces of equipment explode around a patient, following which the doctor and nurse assigned to that patient stick their heads up from behind the gurney on which their patient still lays. They look around with bemused expressions on their faces  and then slowly duck down behind the gurney again like Arte Johnson in the bushes on Laugh-In, or like two co-eds in a college sex comedy. The moment was completely out of place, and it wasn't the only such moment in the film.

As much as I enjoyed the message of the movie and the performances by Ravin Spangler, Brandon Tyler Russell, Dean Cain, and a few of the supporting actors (like John Savage as a homeless guy, and Seth Menachem and Sarah Phillips as Jerrys foster parents), Im afraid this is one Christmas film Ill end up never watching again.",1448841600,12,3138,4.732600732600733
