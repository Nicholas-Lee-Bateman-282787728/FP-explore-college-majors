461497,5,6302439698,"This is one movie that I watched when I was younger and still til this day remains one of my favorites though you cant find it anywhere but on a VHS and lets face it people VHS will soon be out of date just like our old record, 8 track and cassette players thats why this jem belongs on DVD. I would certainly buy this movie if it was on DVD but I'm not paying $15 or more for an used VHS. Scott Valentine and Michelle Little does a wonderful job in this hilarious comedy as well as the underrated Gina Gallego who also starred on NBC's Santa Barbara!

So my suggestion is if you ever get a chance to watch this movie on tv do it you won't regret it but yes it is worth $15 on a DVD!!! Please people put this movie to a DVD!",1120608000,11,724,3.891891891891892
461498,5,6302439698,"As many other 80's movie fan, I find that this movie is missing from my collection. This title belongs next to such classics as SWAMP THING, BLADE RUNNER, THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW, THE SECRET OF MY SUCCESS, TRON, THE STUFF, THEY LIVE, ETC. This is not the greatest movie ever made, nor does it have the greatest cast ever assembled, but it does bring joy to TBS, TNT, and USA NETWORK late nite-movie watching owls.",1118880000,3,419,4.526315789473684

461500,3,6302439698,"This is your basic, 80's, campy horror movie -- so be warned. If you watch this movie, prepare to face EXTREME campy-ness. Complete with somewhat impressive special effects, entertaining scenes, a little comedy, and bad acting -- ""My Demon Lover"" delivers a top-knotch performance in the field of 80's, horror movie campy-ness! I'd check it out. But serious horror movie-goers beware...",1021939200,,386,5.344262295081967
461501,1,6302439698,"My mother had this habit of renting really off the wall movies when I was a kid. ""My Demon Lover"" crossed my path when I was a youngster, and frankly, the bizarre images have always crept back into my long term memory. I think the guy who is the lead also played Mallory Keatons boyfriend in ""Family Ties"" Watch this movie if you have a lot of time on your hands.",980035200,,363,4.126760563380282

461503,5,6302439698,"This movie is good for anyone who has their head in the clouds.  It's a little freaky and rediculous...you'll see.  It takes a sense of humor to appreciate this movie.  When I first saw it I loved it, it belonged to my  best friend.  I began to always demand we watch it every time I went to her  house.  I'll never get tired of looking at this movie...I expecially like  the sexual content...I told you it was freaky!",949017600,4,418,4.269230769230769

461586,4,6302439698,"I like 80's flicks I haven't seen in years and this was definitely one of them. Don't mean to bash it, it's not great really compared to the quality movies at that time. It does have a good song in it and some badly entertaining scenes. It's cheesier than hell and the effects are lame, but it's a trip down memory lane. Surprised this isn't on 2 for 1 horror dvd set. They could pair it with My Best Friends A Vampire. Fun fact: Scott Valentine said in an interview he wish he hadn't done the movie as he felt it killed any type of serious career. He said he should've started small in bit parts for movies. Sad how one movie can change your acting landscape.",1436918400,,660,4.2047244094488185

Although this is more of a comedy/b horror film, it's still a Goid one if you grew up on it. Awesome. Thx",1424649600,,262,3.8703703703703702

461639,5,6302439698,"Good, cheesy 80's romantic comedy (with a bit of a horror element).  The storyline is great.  The script is clever.  The actors may not have been the most popular, but they definitely pegged it in this.  My mom was probably the only one in my family that really got a kick out of it too.  Everyone else just didn't get it.",1411084800,,322,4.213114754098361

461647,3,6302439698,"Bought this movie for a friend upon his request.  It's not really my style of movie but it wasn't a bad watch.

It is rather dated, with a cheesy storyline and old effects (not a bad thing), I'd watch it again.",1407024000,,210,4.097560975609756

461650,5,6302439698,"Produced by the Robert Shaye - whom also produced all of the Nightmare on Elm Street Films... You can see many early elements of his work throughout the film that are weaved into many of his other works..

I only hope they don't attempt to remake this quirky little film - it's perfect just the way it is... :)

Loved this movie since I was a kid!",1395187200,,347,4.164179104477612
461651,5,6302439698,Finally they put this on DVD so I can have a hard copy and/or digital amazon copy. I love this movie! I had it on a crappy vhs tape as a recording from many (obviously) years ago and lost that copy to an ex-boyfriend about 10 years ago. I am going to buy the amazon digital copy right away and watch this on my ps3 tonight!!,1392940800,,324,3.9242424242424243
461652,3,6302439698,Great quirky 80s movie.  Watching it now 20 years later it almost seems like a parody of everything 80s.  Ridiculously funny if you grew up during to time.,1388016000,,155,4.5
461653,5,6302439698,I absolutely loved this movie.  It has all the elements of a great Joss Whedon script with a wonderful heart-felt B-movie delivery.  The romance and chemistry between the leads is endlessly charming. The twists are as clever as they are bizarre.  This movie hit me hard and left me thinking about it for days after the first viewing.,1383177600,,333,4.706896551724138

I am so Happy , I watch it all the time.",1380672000,,105,3.24
461655,4,6302439698,I watched this when I was younger so I had to buy it. Yes it it totally cheesy. Cheesy lines cheesy acting. But it is meant to be. And it is alot of fun to watch.. I love the cheese!,1369785600,,182,3.575
461656,4,6302439698,"We've been looking for this movie on DVD for the longest time.  It's no Academy Award winner, just plain 'ole cheesy 80's fun.",1368835200,2,126,4.478260869565218
461677,5,6302439698,"the main character in this movie, Kaz, kinda reminds me of myself (except for the part where he turns into a demon, even though he's a friendly demon). This is a hilarious flick, okay so there were some corny parts, but every movie has corny parts. This item was shipped mega fast and in great shape!

I strongly recommend this seller, and I will definitely be doing business here again! If you have a yen for 1980s yarns, then check this out!",1368144000,,443,4.402439024390244
461678,5,6302439698,"I fell in love with this movie back when it first came out. Unfortunately, it was never released on DVD until fairly recently, and the copy I had on VHS was getting worn out! This is a very funny romantic comedy, with far more going on than the typical 'dysfunctional boy meets dysfunctional girl' scenario. It puts a whole new spin on the trials and tribulations of a girl who seems to be looking for love in all the wrong places, with all the wrong kind of guys, and proves that true love can overcome even the biggest obstacles!",1364688000,,531,4.373737373737374

461680,5,6302439698,I watched this a million years ago and had all but given up finding it on DVD.  Wonderful campy movie laughed myself silly.  If you like off the wall buy it you won't be sorry.  If you are looking for Academy Award stuff you might want to steer clear.,1352851200,,251,4.081632653061225
461681,5,6302439698,I'm very surprised this movie never made it to dvd. It's so funny. About a man that lives with a curse. Every time he gets all worked up the demon in him comes out. A must see movie.,1334361600,,182,3.8157894736842106
461682,5,6302439698,They should really put this movie on DVD and Blu - Ray . This is an awesome movie . Please bring this movie to DVD and Blu - Ray,1334102400,,128,3.4482758620689653
461683,5,6302439698,"Love this movie, unfortunately it's not on dvd or digital, bummer.  Watched it when I was really young and was looking for movies in the 80's to purchase and stumbled on this.  The movie was what I expected for a VHS.  Highly recommend.",1326585600,,236,4.441860465116279
461684,5,6302439698,"Serious horror fans should stay away, but if you're in the mood for a slice of supernatural sweetness, ""My Demon Lover"" is a great way to pass an evening.  It's the terrifyingly tender tale of Denny, a pretty girl who's really unlucky in love(her boyfriend dumps her on HER birthday and steals her tv) who meets Kaz, a handsome homeless guy who picks up spare change serenading passerby with his saxophone.  But Kaz has a problem--he transforms into a puke-green demon whenever he gets(ahem)interested in any female...and a serial killer called The Mangler is on a lady-killing streak through New York City.  Can Kaz be a devil in disguise--or can Denny help her new man kick his curse?",1306108800,2,686,4.796610169491525

Yes, it's a little off the wall, but....it's cute, lots of laughs, and has some fairytail scary parts - makeup is funny to watch - it was the 80s. However, the story is very sweet, and yes it's probably a girly film but it's fun to watch. This should be on DVD...;)",1254960000,,434,3.9431818181818183
