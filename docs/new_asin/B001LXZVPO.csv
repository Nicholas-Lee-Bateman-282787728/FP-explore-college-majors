8354344,5,B001LXZVPO,"Got a copy for free, so was skeptical at first, but I'd totally buy it now that I know what it is.  My one-year-old LOVES this dvd.  I can't get him to watch anything on tv except this movie.  He dances to the music and his eyes are glued to the screen.  It gives me a glorious 40-mins+ of peace!
The dvd has two ""episodes"", one about making friends and the other about sharing.  I'm not sure how effective the lessons are, seeing as how we haven't reached that life stage yet, but the characters are cute and the show is kid-friendly.  It also has three ""learn to draw the characters"" sequences at the end, and has a list of definitions for the Japanese(?) words used in the show.  I highly recommend this dvd!",1286928000,,711,4.2611940298507465
8354345,5,B001LXZVPO,"I stumbled upon the website and viewed the demo videos with my daughter who is about 20 months old.  Though an avid fan of Sesame Street, she insisted on going back to the Tulipchan website and wanted to watch the demo videos over and over again.  When we finally saw the dvd, she couldn't take her eyes off of the TV.  I especially like that the animation isn't too busy and slow enough for even young children to appreciate.  I would definitely recommend this dvd!",1244073600,,466,4.447058823529412
8354346,5,B001LXZVPO,"My son who doesn't usually sit to watch tv, sits mesmerized while watching this DVD.  Clean production, great message, highly recommended!",1243641600,,138,5.571428571428571
8354347,5,B001LXZVPO,"I have to admit that I haven't watched Tulipchan, mainly because I'm always driving while the kids are watching it in the back.  But I know that they absolutely love and adore Tulipchan!  I know because I hear them recite the phrases word for word while watching the video.  That's quite impressive for 7, 5, & 3 year olds!  And at home, they reenact the scenes and take turns pretending to be the different characters...like the Tamanegi brothers.
Very entertaining yet educational video!  My wife and I love letting the kids watch Tulipchan!",1236902400,3,543,4.795698924731183
8354348,4,B001LXZVPO,"Tulipchan ""Let's Be Friends!"" is a charming DVD providing parents and child care providers an opportunity to expose young children to early life skills like sharing and making friends. Tulipchan interjects a bit of Japanese vocabulary throughout, similar to Dora the Explorer who employs Spanish. The animation of Tulip's adventures is simple and age appropriate, unlike so many children's offerings that utilize slang and slapstick. A three year old sat mesmerized from beginning to end yet a 5 year old with whom I watched this DVD commented, ""Next time can we skip the beginning?"" referring to a noisy red monster (who turns out to be imaginary) and quickly segways into the story. Children from 2 thru 9 absolutely loved the bonus segment that shows them how to draw the three primary characters, Tulip, Cherri and Citrus. My refrigerator is covered with Tulipchan portraits!",1235174400,3,879,5.153846153846154
8354349,5,B001LXZVPO,"I first didn't know what this character or DVD was all about. But you realize this cute and pure character's world is full of challenges and my daughter (3) is drawn to it. It's so hard to find kids' educational DVDs nowdays that teach them the basic of social skills and still be fun! This DVD is full of basic values that children need to know to get through their everyday lives. This loving and cute main character, Tulipchan tries her best not to be tempted to do bad things that her friends do. Her parents are always caring and supportive. It is a warm, loving, and very educational DVD without any sarcastic remarks that most children's DVDs now contain. The website of Tulipchan is appropriate and safe for them, too. We play Tulipchan games every day!! I highly recommend to parents or educators of young children.",1231977600,2,824,4.612244897959184
8354350,5,B001LXZVPO,"I am a special education resource teacher and I am always looking for good resources to teach social skills for students with Autism. TulipChan is perfect for our students who often learn social skills from video modeling and written social stories.  Teachers and parents can use this DVD as a tool to talk about social language involved in making a friend. The animation is amazing and yet not too overwhelming for our students!!!  I would definitely recommend this DVD to other special educators and parents with special needs.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tulipchan-Let-s-Be-Friends/dp/B001LXZVPO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tulipchan: Let's Be Friends</a>",1229040000,2,704,6.4787234042553195
