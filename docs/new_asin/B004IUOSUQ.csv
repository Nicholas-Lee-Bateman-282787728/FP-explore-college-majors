8431274,5,B004IUOSUQ,I have a grandson named Kobe about the age of Cody in the film. I got this because it will show him the civil war through his eyes.  the boy even looks and acts like my Kobe.  It is a wonderful show that will develop a childs interest in American History.  I highly recmmend it to schools for students to see and discuss also.  it is quite an exciting story.  i hope many enjoy it!!,1338163200,3,382,4.04
