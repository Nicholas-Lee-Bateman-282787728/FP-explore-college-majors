4855274,4,B005OZ4G38,A nice Christian movie and the cinematography was excellent.,1420156800,,60,5.777777777777778
4855275,2,B005OZ4G38,This movie was not worth the money.  Some reviews of it are misleading.  The ending is very predictable and leaves nothing to the imagination.,1403568000,3,142,4.875
4855276,1,B005OZ4G38,"This movie did not grab my attention at the very beginning, therefore, I turned it off.  It is a low rated film which was another reason why it was hard to watch.",1389571200,,162,4.0625
4855277,5,B005OZ4G38,A fun entertaining Christ centered movie with a twist and turn that will keep you entranced to the end! Fine acting with beautiful scenery. Much better than the book.,1358812800,4,166,4.758620689655173
4855278,3,B005OZ4G38,"It was pretty slow.  My husband who usually will watch with me, turned it off. I will have to go watch the ending later.",1358726400,,120,4.0
4855279,5,B005OZ4G38,"Cute story, great scenery, well-developed characters added to mystery. Is the handsome stranger all he claims to be--or doesn't claim to be? Wonderful Christmas message with a great Christmas song by Michael Schroeder. A plus in anyone's Christmas movie collection.",1355875200,5,265,5.65
4855280,1,B005OZ4G38,What a disappointment! I love Christmas movies but the acting was so bad in this one that I didn't even finish watching it before I turned it off and placed it in my yardsale box. Looks like it was filmed with a home video camera.,1354147200,2,230,4.133333333333334
4855281,4,B005OZ4G38,"Okay,so I purchased this movie on whim after reading the overview.  First I will say that is not perfect as far as production. The company that made it is non-profit and I think it sounded like they were just getting started so I am sure that the finishing touches suffered from what other studios do with money readily avaliable.

Now, with having said that, this is a clean movie, with a bit of a surprise that unfolds as the movie progresses.  It is sort of slow to begin with, but if you stick with it, you won't be sorry IF you enjoy family movies with a Christian base.  Yes, it has a few bumps but it was good.",1353974400,10,617,4.203389830508475
4855282,5,B005OZ4G38,"If you keep in mind that it is not a high budget film with big ticket actors, it is a good movie. It is cute, clean, and enjoyable.
Lucy's new fiance (not husband) had left and she was very sad about the broken engagement.
Joe was haunted by the death of a patient-who he did his best to save.
The message that God cares was clear, but not too long winded.",1511827200,3,356,4.028169014084507

4855286,2,B005OZ4G38,"I fast forwarded through part of it, as it dragged on. There was a plot twist that did get interesting for a while.  But not worth it.",1511481600,,134,3.962962962962963
4855287,1,B005OZ4G38,"I am surprised that this has such high ratings. I only made it about 5 minutes. Once the puppet came out, I couldn't handle it.",1511308800,,127,4.12
4855288,1,B005OZ4G38,This is one of the most poorly acted Christmas movies I have had the misfortune to see. I didn't make it too far in because of the awful acting. Do yourself a favor and give this one a pass.,1511222400,,190,3.8974358974358974
4855289,1,B005OZ4G38,"Hard to get through, at times it was slow and seemed like a home movie that someone forgot to cut between takes.",1510876800,,112,4.136363636363637
4855290,1,B005OZ4G38,"I'm noticing there are many people who have not finished this movie, therefore, will have to summarize it, because it's insane.

The associate producer (Joe) was in fact the psychologist of Lucy's late husband who had committed suicide while on his watch. Before the husband killed himself, Joe would watch the video messages from her to further understand his patient. But, WAIT, he falls in love with her! Therefore, with the husband out of the picture, he can begin a bizarre game of lies and manipulation to get her to fall in love with him.

That would be enough to scare anyone away upon finding out his ruse, however, it's revealed that there was one video that was not watched. It's a video where Lucy tells her husband that she does not love him. Bad news because Lucy thinks she was responsible for his suicide. Turns out it was Joe's (the top mind in the psychology field) bad judgement, removing him from his medications. But no worries, because Joe and Lucy fell in love within the span of maybe 4 days, she didn't love her husband who killed himself and now they can start fresh.

Joe clearly manipulated Lucy in this movie. This is not romantic. This is not a story about morality. This is a horror film.",1510790400,6,1219,4.58256880733945

4855296,1,B005OZ4G38,This is a cringe-worthy film. You will laugh at how horrible the acting is! Don't waste your time.,1510012800,2,98,4.5
4855297,2,B005OZ4G38,Boring and cliche.,1509840000,,18,5.333333333333333
4855298,5,B005OZ4G38,"Great movie with an interesting plot. Give it a chance and you might just be surprised.
The honesty is refreshing.
For the most part, larger budgets just produce less honest acting and less wholesome scripts.",1509753600,,208,4.9714285714285715

4855300,1,B005OZ4G38,I got through the first 5 minutes and couldn't stand the acting. I have seen far better acting at the local community college.,1508803200,,126,4.521739130434782

4855304,5,B005OZ4G38,"Hi all I thought this was a charming movie . Things like this can happen in real life , think about it .
All in all the movie was a little slow and could have been directed better. but I found it charming none the less.
I recommend you should see it at least once ..",1503273600,,266,3.767857142857143

4855306,1,B005OZ4G38,"I'm a sucker for romantic Christmas movies, so of course I added this to my watchlist. Having seen a lot of movies in my lifetime, I'm pretty forgiving about acting, actors, plot line, filming, etc. This did not catch my interest for a number of reasons, and I ended up turning if off after about 10 minutes.",1502755200,,308,4.421052631578948

4855309,3,B005OZ4G38,"This was about a family news channel that welcomed in a news producer to their station with no resume. There was also a romance with a couple of plot twists thrown in. I was so disappointed in the fact that this family boldly called themselves Christians, yet when it came to a place where that was tested they failed miserably. They were so judgemental and wouldn't even give a chance for explanation. This really could have been such a powerful and touching message.",1501200000,3,468,4.650602409638554

As previous reviews state, it has very poor acting, is a very low budget movie (sound and set), and SLOWWW.  Nothing professionally done about this movie.  It doesn't have much of a Christmas theme, has a forgiveness kind of message, but defiantly not worth the money I paid for it.  There are MUCH better Christmas movies out there with a much more uplifting, Christian theme/message to them than this.  Not sure what to do with my Dvd now except maybe yard sale it.  Would never watch it again.",1452816000,,612,4.45945945945946

The story actually isn't bad, but the script and dialogue are horrible. It could have been a decent movie if some of the core elements were better. Overall, I'd say don't waste your time unless you are REALLY bored.",1513296000,,351,4.587301587301587
