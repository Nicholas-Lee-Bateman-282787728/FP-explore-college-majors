8584630,5,B00CPQ81FI,"Duch is the most disturbing and frightening documentary I have ever seen. An old, soft-spoken man telling of horrifying atrocities he was complicit in during the reign of terror of the Khmer Rouge.. Seeing an absolute monster talk of his deeds is a sobering look at evil. Want to know what evil looks like? Watch this video and you will never doubt that you have seen evil in explicit detail.",1480809600,,392,4.614285714285714
8584631,4,B00CPQ81FI,"This is fascinating on many levels, probably more for the real Cambodia/Khmer Rouge historian than the everyday viewer, but for those who wish to hear what Duch has to say in his defence, it's excellent. it also contains really rare and fascinating footage from the Khmer Rouge era, propaganda films that are very rarely seen. I do have one strong criticism of this film. Duch reluctantly admits that in S-21, people were experimented on- it's not at all well documented or widely researched - and to be honest, hardly surprising, albeit distasteful. What is distasteful is that Panh uses footage of vivisection on animals when these issues are brought up in the film. I don't want to see this and I don't think it's relevant. It doesn't contribute to our disapproval of the regime, if that's his intention. Use footage from Nazi Germany if you must; it's a more accurate comparison. It's something that seems to have really struck Panh as he mentions it here, again in his book The Elimination and again in The Missing Picture. Relevant to the human aspect, sure- but leave the animals out.",1441152000,,1091,4.808510638297872
8584632,5,B00CPQ81FI,"This documentary is a follow-on to ""S21: The Khmer Rouge Killing Machine.""  Rithy Panh makes excellent use of evidential documents and witnesses/perpetrators. The format is straightforward presentation of hard evidence to Duch for his commentary, confirmation, explanation, or denial. The gleam in Duch's eyes and the beaming smile that possessed him like a demon when he proudly discussed his technique in interrogating Koy Thuon were truly blood-curdling. His derisive laugh when watching a video of one of his former staff accuse him shocked even me -- this was a side that he dared not show in the courtroom. His intensely cruel and character-revealing notes to Suos Neou aka Chhouk, Secretary of Sector 24, sadly did not appear either in this film or in courtroom testimony. Khmer sound track with English subtitles. Having read thousands upon thousands of these original documents myself over the years, I was surprised to find that my reaction was acute nausea. I doubt that either of these two Rithy Panh documentaries are used in training by our military, security, intelligence and diplomatic services, though I am quite certain they should be. This film could easily serve as excellent language training for students of intermediate Khmer at the Foreign Service Institute and the Defense Language Institute. Cambodian Americans will be particularly interested. Be forewarned -- this is not entertainment, but rather a painful journey into the black heart of evil.",1384300800,2,1474,5.32618025751073
8584633,5,B00CPQ81FI,"Duch is a soft-spoken, frail, Cambodian man.  He has a bad left hand; he's missing a finger, and he has a deep, long scar to suggest that his finger didn't leave his hand without extraordinary amounts of pain.  He lives most of his days in a small room with nothing but a bed and a desk, where he pours over his Bible.  He will talk to almost anyone who will listen - he seems afraid to ask for forgiveness, although that's what he wants.  Duch won't ask for forgiveness, but he will tell his story and hope that the listener will turn their mercy upon him.

Most documentaries today serve one of two purposes: to entertain or to persuade.  Morgan Spurlock's adventures into male facial hair, Comic-Con, or product-placement, may have some educational and informative value, but their primary purpose is to engage the audience and to entertain.  Other documentaries, like Food Inc or Countdown to Zero, were created to offer a perspective on an issue.  While these movies can be entertaining, their chief purpose is to raise awareness about an issue and persuade audience members to a certain viewpoint.  Aside from these two kinds of movies, there's a smaller subgroup of documentaries attempt to act as historical record.  Like Shoah, these historical documentaries aren't necessarily trying to persuade or entertain, but they are trying to make sure the past doesn't go unforgotten.

Duch: Master of the Forges of Hell is a companion to the documentary S21: The Khmer Rouge Killing Machine.  Both films follow the mass killings under the dictatorship in Cambodia in the 1970's.  Duch (real name: Kaing Guek Eav), was the director of prisons M13 and S21 - places where ""enemies of the state"" were kept indefinitely to be interrogated, tortured, and killed.  Duch: Master of the Forges of Hell attempts to understand the man responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of Cambodian civilians, and the film allows Duch to explain his side of the story: his rise to power, his role as director of M13 and S21, and his thoughts on the Khmer Rouge's crimes against humanity.

Almost all of Duch is an interview with the titular character.  He is presented with photos, records, and written reports about some of the atrocities that occurred during his tenure as director of the prisons, and he mostly wonders aloud about his past.  He seems rather frank about some of the actions for which he and his crew are directly responsible.  There are intervening scenes that break up this narrative: a couple of men re-enact an arrest, some picture show (rather gruesome) experiments on humans and nonhumans alike.  But at its core, this documentary lives and dies by its narrator: a man with a despicable past.

The actual man, as he is presented today, is a complicated figure.  At times, it is not hard to sympathize with Duch - he comes across less like a monster and more like a cold, calculating man that was concerned as much with pleasing his employers as with turning out solid results (whatever the job may be).  He claims that he was taken by the radical Marxist ideology, but that he never (or very rarely) had a direct hand in violence, torture, or murder.  Some evidence is presented that directly contradicts some of his self-disclosed statements, and this often results in Duch admitting that he has misremembered or intentionally forgotten the past.  By the final minutes of the movie, he claims to have converted to Christianity to beg for forgiveness.  Whether or not this is an actual prostration or posturing is up to the viewer.

Hundreds of thousands of innocent people died during Pol Pot's regime, and this is something that we don't really talk about much in the United States.  It's not that Pol Pot has been forgotten in the States, but he's been lumped together (and under) Josef Stalin and Chairman Mao.  Rithy Panh's documentary feels like a twistedly dark Fog of War, where you just can't believe that this person is admitting his role in something so big, overwhelming, and evil.  I'm thankful that not only was director Rithy Panh able to get Duch to talk so much about his involvement with the Khmer Rouge, but he was able to document all of that history will not allow these crimes against humanity to go uncovered.",1375574400,6,4244,4.7991746905089405
