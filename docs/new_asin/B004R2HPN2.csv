8438647,2,B004R2HPN2,"This movie started out good and seemed fun and light but then it just starts becoming unbelievable and kind of stupid when Raj and Simran are supposed to get married but reveal to each other that Raj is in love with Asha and Simran is in love with Sameer who ""coincidently"" happen to be in love with each other. They plot together to ruin Sameer's and Asha's love to get them for themselves with crazy and ridiculous plots that wouldn't work in real life if one had a million dollars. So they ruin the two lives of people just to get with them even though Asha does not love Raj and Sameer does not love Simran. I won't say what happens in the end but I barely made it to end because it just kept getting more and more ridiculous as time went on.",1304035200,,746,4.1875
