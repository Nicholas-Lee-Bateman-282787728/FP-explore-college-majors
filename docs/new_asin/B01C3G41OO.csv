8752092,3,B01C3G41OO,This is a good film. The Dragon is the second lead. He has several good fight scenes in this film. This film serves as an introduction to Clief. This film is about a group of men who band together to defeat some opium dealers. The film was humourous and action packed. I was eager to watch this film in order to compare Clief to Jim Kelly. Clief is a great martial artist. He projects kindness. Kelly had better one liners. Recommended for action fans.,1471132800,,452,4.392857142857143
