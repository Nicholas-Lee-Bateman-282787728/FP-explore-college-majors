8468403,4,B001E7MMG8,"I enjoyed using this dvd. It is 15 minutes for each day of the week or you can play all of them.  It is not high intensity, I use this dvd on my day off from exercise because it has some really good stretches that make me feel so good.  I usually like high intensity exercises but not every day.  I do take a day or two off from exercise and do stretches and this is a good dvd for your day off.",1379289600,,395,3.7349397590361444
