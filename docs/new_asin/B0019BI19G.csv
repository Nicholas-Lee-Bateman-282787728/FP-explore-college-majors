3431797,4,B0019BI19G,"I think people are WAY too hard on this movie. It deserves more positive reviews particularly because of the lead actor, Nick May. He does a fantastic job creating a character who you can really sympathize with. He's this young kid who gets tangled up in a 3 way relationship with two older men (believe me, there are lot of old guys out there looking for that) and he realizes that nobody really cares about him. The two older guys go to visit their family and ditch him on Christmas. The boy ends up finding himself turning to sex just to get some affection. He tells his hookups he's going to kill himself just hoping that somebody will care enough to tell him not to do it. I really felt bad for this character. His parents disowned him and his sister is horrible too. The actor does a brilliant job of making this character feel like he's all alone in the world.

There are a couple of horrible scenes in the movie that should have been left out. One involving a Santa and Mrs Clause jumping around and another involving an orgy. The orgy was just exploitative. Probably to try and get more people to watch the movie. Which is a shame because it takes away from the serious subject matter.

Anyway, I hope Nick May finds more work because he's a really good actor.",1219276800,39,1269,4.395744680851064
3431798,2,B0019BI19G,"This movie had it's moments, and it was worth watching once, but I wouldn't call it a ""gem"".  Hard to see where that adjective fits in, but to each their own.

3431799,1,B0019BI19G,The young man(Houseboy) in between numerous bouts of sex tells all his encounters that he will commit suicide on Christmas Eve. After a while you are hoping the he will do so and put everyone out of their misery. A film populated by some pretty seedy and hopeless characters. Don't expect to be uplifted anywhere during this movie. Redemption comes in the last five minutes but by that time I had hit the fast forward button.,1218326400,7,425,4.605263157894737
3431800,1,B0019BI19G,"If the religious right needs more fuel for their anti-gay crusades, I'm sure they would be happy to add this film to their ammunition. Promiscuous sex, drug use and the whole concept of an older gay couple using a young boy as their ""toy"" is bad enough. Nick May is very good in the title role and manages to create a sympathetic portrayal of a young guy desperately in need of love. This is quite an accomplishment considering that the script basically only uses one sexual encounter after another to paint his plight. The last five minutes promises a glimpse of what this film could have been. Too bad the viewer has to sit through total dreck to get there.",1217980800,8,659,4.5
3431801,4,B0019BI19G,"Ricky (Nick May) is a cute twinkish 21 year old who is ""The Houseboy"" (2007) to a gay couple in New York City.  Or, more accurately, he is their frequent bed partner, or ""toy"" that they use to try to convince themselves that their relationship is as solid as it was when they first met ten years before.  When the couple goes to one of their parents for Christmas, Ricky is left alone to housesit and care for their small menagerie of fish, bunnies, hamsters and feral cats.

What they don't know is that Ricky overheard one of them lament that he wanted a ""new toy"" for Christmas, which devastated the young man, who had recently become estranged from his family after coming out to them.  Already depressed by being alone during the holidays, and devastated at the thought of being tossed aside by the couple he thought loved him, he plans to commit suicide in their home on Christmas Eve, so that they will discover him when they return.  In the meantime, he hooks up with anonymous tricks he meets on the internet, agrees to go home with a kindly older man, and has a couple of dangerous liaisons with a rough-trade hood he met in a park.  The one bright spot of his week is meeting Blake (Blake Young-Fountain), a guy his own age who seems genuinely friendly and real, but is put off by Ricky's premature push toward intimacy.

Despite some delightful eye candy, the film's overall impression is darkly emotional and somewhat depressing, at first.  Stick with it, however, as there are some surprises in store.  Acting is adequate, the direction a bit sloppy in parts, but, overall, this is a noteworthy dramatic film that won some kudos at gay film festivals, though a bit uneven for my taste.  Not rated, but likely would have been an NC-17 due to some full nudity, graphic drug use, and simulated sex.  DVD includes some outtakes. I give it four twink-ling stars out of five.",1217721600,20,1883,4.574404761904762

3431819,5,B0019BI19G,"The sensationalistic title and cover do not do this movie justice. He is NOT a houseboy. It's a great story of the stress and loneliness a rejected and lonely gay kid goes through. He is confused and uses frequent sex with strangers trying to get his emotional dependency needs met, which any mature person knows only leads to greater isolation and addictions. Lots of softcore going on with and around him. Depression, substance abuse,  and suicidal ideation feature prominently.

Not a comedy and not very sexy, this film is quite the downer, following a depressed, lost, young gay man through the last few days before Christmas.  Except for the ending, the film could have been made by an anti-gay group to show the meaninglessness and hopelessness of ""the gay lifestyle.""

They leave and he begins to meet anonymous men on the street and internet and has sex all over the place. The performances, except for the star ""Ricky"" are all good, ricky mopes thru the entire movie, is he supposed to? I don't know but it is horribly annoying.

3431832,3,B0019BI19G,"This is the story of Ricky, he is `the housboy' for a gay couple who have him a s a sort of live in play thing, very nihilistic. However he seems to genuinely like/love them both and it is Christmas and as he has been let down by his own family he thinks he is going to be with them. Except they are going away to one of their parents for `the holidays', and are leaving him with extensive directions on how to look after their love nest. This involves a lot of plant and fish feeding apparently.

Before they leave Ricky overhears them talking about getting a `new toy' for Christmas and he knows they are referring to his position within the home. They leave and he is distraught, so he goes out and hooks up with an astonishing amounts of success with every low life cruiser on the planet and a few more besides. His first guy is into chicks except they lack any felating prowess - like we didn't know. He then lets them come back to his place and get up to all sorts of shenanigans, the sort you normally need to visit a `members club' for. He then announces on a number of occasions that he will commit suicide on Christmas Eve.

Whilst the plot is somewhat limited, it is actually a quiet and warm film, with love and the lack of it as a central theme. Where I felt it fell down was in some average support performances and the comedy fairground music that kept on crashing into the mood of the thing. Whilst nearly all of the guys he picks up are universally self centred and actually horrible, there are some that redeem gayhood and men in general and at 71 minutes this did not drag. This won't float everyone's boat but it is one for those interested in gay cinema.",1323216000,,1675,4.264150943396227
3431833,3,B0019BI19G,"Interestingly, not one of the reviews of this film gets close to identifying the critique of gay culture that is its raison d'etre.  One could argue that makes the film something of a failure, but I'm not so sure.  Maybe it says more about the gay audience.  One is tempted to conclude that if it's not soft porn or romantic wish-fulfillment then they're just not buying it.  However, if you're open to something more, and something different, then you might just appreciate The Houseboy.  It's slow in spots and the acting isn't great, but it's an unsettlingly accurate portrait of the demoralizing effects of the merry-go-round of mindless sex, and it has something worthwhile to say about the things that get lost along the way.  For all it's faults, it's ultimately as sweet as it is dark, and somewhat more profound than it might at first seem.",1292544000,2,849,4.741496598639456
3431834,3,B0019BI19G,"This was an OK film. There were just times when the ""acting"" was a bit forced. It left me feeling like a stoner watching friends, instead of any real emotion. It was 'cute' and 'edgy' but not otherwise note worthy. I'm sure it was big at Sundance - those movies are usually eerie and off-putting.",1292284800,,296,4.4
3431835,5,B0019BI19G,"EUREAKA!!! A three way commited relastionship I could totally make that work.  This movie was really touching, its about this boy who is the ""boyfriend"" of a gay couple in New York.  The couple take off to visit relatives for the holiday leaving our young ""Houseboy"" to spend Christmas alone.  He over heres a small piece -a tiny sound bite, of a conversation between his ""boyfriends"" and he discovers that he is not wanted by one of the two.  He decides that on Christmas Eve he is going to kill himself.  This is really a great movie, I know some people didn't like it because of the drugs and loveless sex, but that didn't bother me. I really felt for the ""Houseboy"" and I really liked the ending.  I don't know, there was just something really sweet about the whole movie that comes together nicely in the end.  It worked for me.",1285200000,3,833,4.440789473684211
3431836,1,B0019BI19G,"The cover of this film suggests a working relationship between two men and a young man who is their houseboy. What you actually get is a few moments of interaction between these characters to establish the fact that the houseboy is no different than the other pets that the two men own, apart from the sex, I'm hoping. Treated more as a possession than a person, the houseboy recognizes this indifference and spends the entire film commiserating himself to whomever will listen. Having no common sense he internalizes this apathy as a valid judgement of his character and feels his only option is to kill himself. This comes across not only as ridiculous and unbelievable but also manipulative. This aspect is strengthened when he confesses to everyone he meets that he is going to kill himself on Christmas Eve, hoping, I guess, to provoke some concern for his miserable existence. Of course this makes him a perfect target for those who would advantage themselves at his expense, which he seems to not mind, after all his life is unremarkable anyway. Interject a love interest (Blake) who has his life together, disallow the fact that the houseboy is self-destructive, mix it together with a shallow uneventful relationship and you have a film called ""The Houseboy"". You are left only with the thought, Run Blake, RUN!!!",1279756800,2,1322,4.90625
3431837,4,B0019BI19G,"Pleasantly surprised by this soft gay film, it's meant for Christmas time I guess though, it was quite well acted and not a bad storyline, which I won't spoil, the lead ""actor"" was extremely cute, and it had its good scenes.
All in all I would buy another one. Set one here in Edinburgh Scotland and I can wear my kilt next time xx",1279584000,,331,4.1875
3431838,4,B0019BI19G,"This was really a pretty depressing film. Even the more uplifting ending was sad. Four stars is more than generous. But Nick May really did a fine job of acting in a less than stellar role.

Ricky is a rather pudgy, scruffy, depressed twenty-one year old. He is left to spend Christmas alone when the middle aged Gay couple he has been sleeping with, leaves him to house sit their nasty, overfurnished flat, and feed their odd assortment of animals. Ricky can't celebrate Christmas with his family after coming out to his mother, so his holiday plans include being indiscriminately promiscuous, and committing suicide on Christmas Eve. His Christmas miracle comes when he makes friends with a black kid from the neighbourhood who has two lesbian mothers. Somehow this gives him the courage to keep living.

Like I said, Nick May did an excellent job of making a cheesy role into a character you could sympathise with. It wasn't enough to make the film a masterpiece of cinema. But I've certainly seen worse movies.  I guess I should add that watching The Houseboy might be depressing enough to make you want to commit suicide. So see it with a friend, or at least with a good stiff dose of anti-depressants.",1265500800,,1207,4.738095238095238
3431839,3,B0019BI19G,"For the price, this is a good movie. It's not perfect, but it does tell a message, and, the guy is cute.",1252972800,,104,3.772727272727273
3431840,2,B0019BI19G,"Don't be misled by the cover. The two guys disappear within five minutes of the opening credits leaving the boy in the center to his own devices and mainly to face imaginary monsters of his own making.
There is no conflict to speak of. The main hero apparently believes that his more adult friends (who left for Christmas to spend it with the family of one of them) intend to replace him with a younger specimen of the same breed and plans to commit a spectacular suicide so that his companions could know what harm they made.
Unfortunately, the whole story (hardly credible from the very beginning) is played rather badly so instead of a story we get a sequence of scenes in which our hero tries to drown his pain in mindless sex. At least there is sex but be forewarned - the adjective mindless was fully intended. And it applies to more than just sex.
In case you refused to listen to this (or any other) review, and then fell asleep or switched the video off halfway through the movie (warning: spoiler follows!) there is a happy ending. But I swear - by the time it comes, you will hardly care.",1247529600,4,1099,4.41871921182266
3431841,3,B0019BI19G,"This script is far less about the relationships between the three people pictured on the cover art and far more about a young gay man's personal struggle with the realities of being raised in a Southern fundamentalist setting and the challenges of familial non-acceptance.  The title of this film could just as easily have been ""The Boy"" and probably would have been more accurately titled, ""The Depressed, Suicidal-Tendencies Boy.""  The acting quality is varied and the story is generally familiar creating a product that fails to really surprise or inspire.  Like many movies, this one pleases more if you don't go in with too many or too high of expectations.  The most redeeming quality of this movie is the accurate portrayal of one-night-stands and recreational drug use not leading to a long-term solution of emotional fulfillment or self-love. I probably would have liked it more if I had known in advance that the movie's central story is really about just the houseboy and not very much about the relationship between him and the two men with whom he lives.",1246838400,,1067,4.944134078212291
3431862,1,B0019BI19G,"One star for a potentially great idea turned into the lamest movie imaginable.  The issue of young people committing suicide is unfortunately a growing problem.  So the story of a lonely, depressed 21-year-old gay man -- (well, in this case a 21-year old gay boy) could have been very worthwhile.

The dialogue and acting are just dreadful.  And, I could be wrong, but it should be possible for a movie to show someone being bored (and depressed) without the movie itself being boring (and depressing.)

Ricky, the main character, is in love with his former college professor Simon, and is having a 3-way affair with Simon and his lover of 10 years.  Simon and ""husband"" go off to visit the folks for Christmas, leaving Ricky to house-sit and take care of the various animals for a week.  Ricky picks up anyone and everyone, acting like a needy, pathetic shnook.  It's actually embarrassing to watch him go about his business.  He announces to anyone who'll listen that he's planning on offing himself on Christmas and letting his hosts find his dead body when they come home.  Supposedly what drives him over the edge is the fact that Simon's lover is tired of Ricky [gee, I wonder why] and wants a new ""houseboy.""  The various characters' reactions to Ricky's pleas for attention are somewhat interesting -- for the most part they don't believe him -- but like everything else in the movie, not done very well.

It's hard to have any sympathy for a character who is so selfish, thoughtless and just plain stupid.  Lucky for him, a sweet black guy, the gay son of a lesbian couple, shows up and they all live happily ever after and hopefully don't plague us with any more terrible movies.

3431870,2,B0019BI19G,"I knew a film maker who died very suddenly and I remember thinking: ""What does a film maker leave behind?"" This thought was the seed that sprouted the movie: Beatific Vision.

I found myself thinking of a secret film that a character would leave behind when he dies. Not one he wished not to be found but one he planned to be found. More than a final will and testament this film was a ""Beatific Vision"", a view into the future of all characters and a clear mapping of the coincidences that would occur.

As I began to write the screenplay the voice of the Angel started to speak softly and occasionally. Upon many re-writes the Angel voice was vieing for main character status. I tried to reel in the angel but he (Angel Chad) wrestled control away from me.

When another close friend was passing to the other side, she added a strong dose of acceleration to the writing process. There now are so many Angels (most recently my Mother) involved, I feel I am at best the living hands to this project.

When I was a small boy my parents used to call me: Angel Michael when they wanted my behavior to change. I actually grew up thinking I was an angel including my sprouting scapula wings. Today, I do not think I am an angel but I surely believe that I am their vehicle for expression on earth.

Thank-you angels for this ""angels on earth"" experience!
