If you are a Jet Li fan, or even a fan of Martial Arts films, I'm sure you will love this movie. This is propbably Jet's best American film.",1010707200,2,283,3.982456140350877

1669494,4,B00005V1YG,"I typically like Jet Li movies but this one left me wondering why I spent my time trying to make sense of it instead of enjoying it for the entertainment value.

Jet Li is a master of his craft, there's little doubt of that.  Add to the mix Jason Statham and toss in Delroy Lindo for good measure and you should have the makings of a good flick.  It was okay but I spent too much time trying to analyze the darn thing to make it entertaining for me.  I can't help it, it just didn't hold me.

1669513,3,B00005V1YG,"It's Jet Li, how can you go wrong? Well with this one they did. There is plenty of action and very well choreographed fighting scenes, and the story is quite decent, but the music choice is what killed it. The movie producers decided it was a good idea to go with really generic and bad artists for the hard rock and metal elements of the songs they wanted. They really could have gone with better music, but other than that it's an ok movie.",1361232000,,442,4.273809523809524

There is also another ""time cop"" that is on his trail and will not stop until he is brought to justice.

This is a really good movie. It combines action, martial arts, and Sci-fi very uniquely. Jet Li and Jason Statham always make a good pair. The One is a pretty unique movie, and is definitely worth watching.",1353628800,,714,4.534883720930233

Once my brother reciceved it,opened it, he was unable to watch it because it was so scratched up it wouldn't play.
When I tried to see about returning it, I found that I only had a few days left to return it. There was no way I could get it back from Hawaii in time to send it back to you in order to get my refund. There definitely needs to be more time for returning products.",1332979200,2,700,3.902097902097902

1669520,3,B00005V1YG,"The story line for this movie is not just a stretch of your imagination, its down right totally impossible, so don't even bother trying to figure out the story line. So casting aside the whole idea of Multi-verses, the whole plot dies.

In the film Jet Li plays Gabe Law, Gabriel Yulaw and Lawless, one of them is on a rampage killing off his other selves in all the other universes. He is almost completely successful having killed 123 of his other selves. As the fable goes, he gets stronger and faster each time he kills one of 'his-selves' something like Highlander, I guess.

The strong point of this film is really in the areas of fighting, action and special effects. It is quite amazing to see Jet Li fighting against himself. The picture borrows strongly from the Matrix with its use of 'bullet time'.

It is a great action film, but with a weak plot, so if you can live with that you will enjoy the film. Just remember to take your brain out of neutral afterwards.",1292112000,,974,4.46067415730337
1669521,1,B00005V1YG,"Back when Jet Li was the in-thing, he made a slew of films that had teenage boys in a whirlwind.  Who doesn't want to see a bunch of butt-kicking!  I, along with my friends, were part of that cloud of over-zealous movie goers who considered Jet Li the godsend, the one who was going to deliver us from boring cinema and keep us glued to our theater seats.

For the most part, I still quite enjoy his films.

`The One' is not one that I enjoy.  In fact, even upon its release, I was turned off by the film.  I remember when I first saw the trailer.  I was so excited.  My friend and I had just seen `The Kiss of the Dragon' and we were only TOO excited for more Li action.  This had to be great.  After about three minutes I knew that my expectations were far too high.  Upon further reflection, this has become not only one of the biggest disappointments for me as a movie-goer, but I the end one of the worst films of this past decade.

Easy.

The plot revolves around single man and his quest to become invincible.  The film presents to us a multiverse, a world where parallel universes contain variations of every individual.  One man has traveled from universe to universe, killing off his other selves in order to gain all their strength.  Things get tricky when he has only one left to kill because that one isn't going down without a fight.

And fight they do.

The plot is kind of campy in parts and not very well fleshed out, but the biggest disappointment was the action scenes.  This came out around the time when it was cool to make your movies look like video games.  I never understood that, and it always upset me.  This movie is the kind of that concept and it is ultimately a huge failure.  The acting is also very weak.  Jet Li can't really act, but he can fight.  He should stick to that and only that.  The big `this movie will be awesome because Jet Li with fight Jet Li' idea was a big failure because that eventuality is far less impressive than it should be.  I'd rather see Li fight other people in a better choreographed fight scene.  This was just awkward.

Bitterly unrewarding, `The One' is a big dud.",1273190400,2,2130,4.28391959798995
1669522,4,B00005V1YG,It is the opinion of the writter that Mr. Li should stick to what he knows best. This would be traditional Kund Fu movies at which he is expert. Also Cops and robbers type movies at which he also excels. Leave the futuristic and science fiction movies to others. The One is a very weak movie although I am sure it will have a following just the same.,1272844800,,350,4.161764705882353

1669524,3,B00005V1YG,"The production values are high, but what they produce is crap. The ending is so bad it's awesome with dialogue like: ""I am Yu-Law...I don't need to know you, YOU need to know ME! I will be The One"".

Even the fight scenes aren't entertaining. The only saving grace is that the core idea of the story is cool (i.e. killing all your alternate reality selves results in ultimate power), but in the end it's basically just a merging of the TV show ""Sliders"" and ""Rumble In The Bronx"".

Honestly, I would have paid to see a 90 minute version of the last 28 seconds of the film where the evil Yu-Law kicks the crap out of thousands of convicts that attack him atop a pyramid on a prison planet. No story, just silly, over the top action.",1246924800,,731,4.2898550724637685

1669527,4,B00005V1YG,Great action movie. Jet Li and Statham are terrific together in this multi-verse flik. The CGI effects are good and it has good story-line. Jet Li is just too cool of a fighter and yet you see him fight himself in this title. I thought it was very entertaining and action packed and would recomend it as should buy movie.,1230768000,,321,4.366666666666666
1669528,4,B00005V1YG,"What if The Matrix's Neo was not born with his abilities, but rather acquired them after killing some 125 versions of himself in parallel universes? In in overly simple statement, that's the basic premise of the movie. Kill one version of you dies, that makes the remaining versions stronger. You can dodge bullets, become ultra smart, ultra strong... basically like Neo. Kill all the other versions and the universe either explodes, or you become god. So is THE One's plan until he meets his last version, and since both THE One and The One are both on equal power, this One might be a bit harder to kill. If you're not confused yet, then by all means buy the movie.

For the action/sci-fi fan, there's plenty of entertainment to behold, and much to sink your teeth in. From the original premise, to fight sequences to the general action, there's certainly enough to keep you going, and the movie succeeds where it should fail. Add a young Jason Statham, and you got a great popcorn flick. Sure, there's a plothole or two, it'll inevitibly be compared to The Matrix, and you'll be perplexed and confused throughout half the movie, but it could have done a lot worse. Get for a rental, check it out on cable, you'll be entertained.",1224979200,,1231,4.646788990825688
1669529,4,B00005V1YG,"I seem to recall this was a pretty good sci-fi / martial arts type movie. Though I also recall it was a little weird in parts.

I generally enjoy Jet Li's work, even if he does have a few weird or ""dark"" roles. In this one, he plays both the good guy and the bad guy(s).

I seem to recall it's more or less sci-fi fluff. Good for killing a lazy weekend afternoon. But probably nothing that would ever go up for an Oscar.",1218499200,,420,3.988095238095238

1669532,4,B00005V1YG,"For a Jet Li movie, The One is most original, blending martial arts with a sci-fi environment and matrix-like effects.  The idea is great, and you may fall in love with ""the idea"" more than the movie itself.  Unfortunately, despite the martial arts, The One executes itself too poorly.

The most memorable element of the film is that there are 2 Jet Li's.  Well, 123 to be exact from 123 different universes, but it comes down to the last 2, and the ""evil"" Jet Li charcater is obsessed with becoming ""the one"".  If he kills off the good Jet Li character, he will become invincibly powerful, though he is nearly there.  Near the end, the final fight is good Li vs bad, a decent fight that lasts 7 minutes, but uses the matrix like effects in the fight poorly.  They kinda look cool at first, but if you get too much into it visually, it just looks pretty weak and breaks up the flow of the martial arts styles throughout the fight.

I have to say the rest of the cast is pretty dull, except maybe Delroy Lindo and Jason Statham, who play 2 agents from the alternate universe trying to stop the evil Li character.  For Jason Statham fans, he's got a pretty large role in The One, but don't expect his character to know how to fight like in the Transporter movies.

The acting is rather weak too, and again, the movie relies a lot off of visual effects, and most just don't do the justice if you have seen the matrix one too many times.  There is a scene where the evil Li character picks up 2 motorcycles and knocks around some cops with them, that actually looked pretty neat.

The originality of this movie, the martial arts, and the good Jet Li vs bad Jet Li still give this movie a 4 stars.  I absoultely loved this movie when it first came out, because I thought oh who cool this is for Jet Li.  Its pretty cool, but don't go watching this in too much detail or you'll ruin the experience.",1179273600,,1892,4.292957746478873
1669533,3,B00005V1YG,"Jet Li possesses incredible martial art skills but outside of being a vehicle to demonstrate his prowess, ""The One"" is a ridiculous action fantasy.  Besides some decent special effects and a good musical score. the film has few redeeming qualities.

The premise of the movie is that there are multiple parallel universes called multiverses.  Travel is prohibited between them and is policed by an authority called the MVA.  Li, a former MVA agent Gabriel Yulaw killed another version of himself on a different universe, in the line of duty and discovered an increase in his strength.  He then proceeded to destroy an additional 122 versions of himself in other universes, each time increasing his strength, with the goal of becoming the supreme being (""the one"").

The last survivng version of Li is Los Angeles sheriff's deputy, Gabe Law, who also has become more powerful.  Yulaw travels to L.A. to eliminate the last version of himself, a formidible adversary.

1669535,4,B00005V1YG,"Just to let you know before hand, I'm reviewing the movie itself, not the DVD. The DVD itself is pretty good, but doesn't stand out from those of other movies. It's got the typical special features and commentary, like most movies. Since the DVD doesn't stand out, I'll get to my review on the movie itself.

The One was overall a pretty good movie, with lots of interesting ideas, but it had some faults as well. What I liked best about it was the fact that The One was original, as far as the setting goes. The idea that there is a copy of each person in each of the many dimensions was original. Other high points included the special effects, camera angles, and stunts. All of these were brought together in the scene where Jet Li fights a copy of himself. However, there were low points in The One as well. For one, I thought that there was too much action in this movie, which somewhat ruined the plot. For instance, most of the movie was fight scenes, which got old after a while. However, since Jet Li is relatively good at fight scenes, that wasn't much of a problem. Another thing that I disliked about this movie was that it seemed like a stereotypical Jet Li film; all action and little plot. The One was almost exactly like Hero and other Jet Li films specifically because most of it was occasionally mindless action. Also, the dialog of The One wasn't great, and occasionally hard to understand, and I thought that the writing wasn't up to par with the special affects and stunts. However, with a great story, setting and ideas, this movie kept me entertained, which is what a movie is supposed to do. For that, I give it seven stars. If you like action movies with intense and good martial arts sequences, then you'll love this movie. However, if you don't enjoy action sequences, then The One will most likely bore you. To conclude, I say that The One was an original movie that is worth taking some time to see.",1154563200,,1928,4.446327683615819

But the thing i really liked about this movie was the accuracy of the martial arts, i didn't notice it at first but the two Jet Li's use very different styles of martial arts, my Sifu even mentioned it. The 'Evil' Jet Li uses Hsing Yi, which is a very direct, blunt head-on style, which makes sense given the character. The 'Good' Jet-Li uses Ba Gua (or Pa Kua as i've heard it called) which is a very fluid, moving, evading art; which again makes sense given the character. This 'meta-plot' is an aspect that intrigued me, as did the relative accuracy (given movies) about their fighting styles.",1152316800,2,794,4.482758620689655

  IMAGE:

Colmbia TriStar present the picture in both a 2:17:1 ratio anamorphic widescreen and a full screen format. The widescreen obviously better duplicates the film's original theatrical showing, but the fullscreen often displays more image at the stop and bottom. Because of the short running time of the feature the two choices can be accommodated one the same side of a dual-layered disc. The picture quality is good when the director isn't playing overmuch with filters and lens. It's a little rough and dark at times, but there are no significant moire effects or grain to worry about. I just wish it were more interesting to look at instead of having to stare at all those dull, tiresome, iron-gray tones.

  SOUND:

The Dolby Digital 5.1 audio, which I had admired in Jet Li's previous films, is here merely loud. There is no subtlety, no grace about it anywhere. It's mainly used to underscore every plot action with a pounding. glaring rock beat, whether the scene needs it or not. Occasionally, a bullet will whiz by in a rear speaker or a car will screech around a corner behind us. It seems hardly worth the effort.

  EXTRAS:

As far as special features go, Columbua have produced enough of them to take one's mind off the movie for a while. Like rather than watching the film, you could listen to the audio commentary with director James Wong and various filmmakers with the telivision screen turned off. You could also watch one of four featurettes: ""Jet Li is the One,"" thirteen minutes long, an extended promo with interviews of cast and vrew. ""Multiverse Creates the One,"" eighteen minutes long, detailing the action sewuences, ""About Face,"" six minutes long, examining how the graphic artists enabled Li to fight himself in the finale, and ""The Many Faces of Jet li."" two minutes, another actor promo. Then, there are some filmographies, a brief animatronic comparison, twenty-eight scene selections, and a widescreen theatrical trailer. English and French are the spoken language options, with English , French,Chinese, Korean, and Thai for subtitles.

The plot is very original and the martial art fights are great. It isn't the best Jet Li movie but it's still a good movie.

The plot is about multiuniverses, meaning that there are replicas of each human being in each of the universes. But one replica wishes to destroy every replica of himself but one isn't as easy as the others. The end's great and the fights are great fun.

1669551,2,B00005V1YG,"(Spoilers below, but the flick's too stupid for it to matter.)

Computer technology has greatly aided the filmmaking industry. Twenty years ago, it would have been impossible to create the stunning visual effects seen in ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"", let alone an entirely digital movie such as ""Monsters, Inc."" However the prevalence of any new technology is invariably followed by those who would rely on gimmick alone rather than quality. Such is the case with martial arts master Jet Li's latest offering, The One.

The One takes place in the future where inter-dimensional travel has become possible. Each dimension runs parallel to our own and is home to the same people, but under different circumstances, living completely different lives. Voyaging to another universe is for authorized dimensional police only. Li plays a former member of this police force going by the name Lawless. We learn, through clumsily constructed exposition, that he has defected after discovering that every time one of his alternate reality selves dies, the `life energy' from the dead self is distributed among the remaining selves. So Li is on a mission to travel to all of the universes and kill himself in each, becoming increasingly more powerful until he becomes `the one' at which point he imagines he'll be unstoppable.

As one might guess, Li also plays our hero, Gabe. Gabe is a cop in a universe that isn't aware that other dimensions exist. He lives a happily oblivious life complete with friends on the force and a beautiful wife, T.K. Lawless travels to this universe followed by two other dimensional law enforcers, Funsch and Roedecker. The two try to stop Lawless from killing Gabe, his last remaining twin, and achieving ultimate power. Oh, and did we forget to mention that it may also cause all the universes to explode? Maybe. No one in the film seems sure.

Immediately, the premise of this film catches the audience's attention. What if there are other worlds out there? Am I as unique as I believe myself to be? What would I be like if one small element of my life were altered? These are all very intriguing questions and writer/director James Wong took care to ensure that none of them were addressed in this film. Indeed, it appears that all opportunities to include thought-provoking content were patently avoided. The fact that this is an action movie, and a martial arts flick on top of that, suggests that one shouldn't expect in-depth social commentary or even a complex plot, but The One continually disappoints it's viewers by raising interesting concepts and then failing to focus on them.

For example, it would have been clever to show Lawless assassinating several different versions of himself, each with a different appearance and lifestyle. This could have easily been done in montage or in a sequence of short combat scenes that would have prepared the audience for the main action of the film. Instead we see only one other version of Li aside from his two main characters and a few humorous images displayed on a computer screen that make it appear as though the director simply gave Li a box of wigs and jackets to play with. Furthermore, the characters are quite weak. We are given brief introductions to each of the main players, but these serve only to remind us of some stereotype or character from another film that we can use as a mental placeholder in lieu of actual character development. After all, this is an action movie; we've got to get to the fighting as quickly as possible. As if that weren't enough of a deterrent, characters are unceremoniously and unnecessarily killed just as we have some semblance of an attachment to them. Both Li's wife, portrayed by the usually brilliant Carla Gugino, and Roedecker, played by the equally talented Delroy Lindo, are executed for no other reason than to motivate Li's good guy character and fuel hatred for his bad guy character, as if the audience could tell the difference.

Predictably, the movie culminates in a huge action scene where Li fights himself. It should have been impressive, but was instead boring and much too long. The computer wizardry that allowed Jet Li to kick his own ass was actually so flawless that I forgot to be impressed by it. After Gabe finally defeats Lawless, the film tries to trick us unsuccessfully with the old `which one is which' routine, but I doubt any audience member was fooled. Justice prevails as the evildoer is punished by being transported to a prison universe that looks like the set of a cheap music video. Our hero is rewarded by being sent to yet another alternate reality where he isn't a fugitive for his doppelganger's crimes and his wife is still alive. Gabe doesn't seem to mind that his real wife is dead and he's been presented with a cheap substitute. And how does he or the police know what his wife's history is in this world? He might fall in love with her all over again, only to discover that her favorite actor has changed from Cary Grant to Adam Sandler. Gabe can pretend his soul mate isn't dead, but he better not come crying to the dimension squad when her stand-in turns out to be a lesbian pyromaniac, decoupage lover, or a carnival freak who has undergone complex surgery to make herself a human lizard. ...Actually, that would be pretty cool. Why wasn't the movie about that?

Overall, The One has few redeeming qualities. The action has been done better in The Matrix and Jackie Chan's canon, the plot is riddled with holes, and the two accomplished character actors, Lindo and Gugino, can't compensate for the fact that Li still hasn't gotten the hang of the English language. If the premise of The One is true and alternate realities do exist, I hope to one day travel to a universe where they never made this film.",1118793600,,5792,4.797595190380761
1669552,3,B00005V1YG,"I remember going head-over-heels when I first saw ""The One"" in theaters, and then when I purchased it on DVD, it became abundantly clear upon each repeated viewing that there was basically nothing much hiding behind the special effects and ultra-cool martial arts moves, but it succeeds in giving you an exciting ride if you want it to.

Don't get me wrong, I like Jet Li. He's a great guy and I seriously think he's the modern day Bruce Lee. He'll kick your ass if you cross the line and interfere with his moral obligations. He upholds that moral code when he's the good Jet Li, but unfortunately falls flat as the evil Jet Li, who pretty much dominates the film and was the sole-reason why I and many others plunked down our 8 bucks to see it in the first place.

Granted, the bad Jet Li wreaks a lot of havok in the film like crushing throats, shooting and bringing heavy objects down on police officers, and moving at supernatural speeds to hurl people across the room and dodge capture. It's a great popcorn flick and will leave your mouth open in awe and excitement, but that depends if you resent the all-too-familiar special effects and ""so-close-to-Highlander-it's-painful"" plot. I must note however that there are some original ideas present that you would have to see for yourself.

What choice did I have, right? Three years later, I stumble upon it again on primetime FX and, in shock, I realize I am viewing perhaps one of the worst films ever to grace US theares, topped only by perhaps the remake of ""Planet of the apes"".

 Jet Li ""acts"" as a (what else?) cop in this horrible attempt at a copy of ""the matrix"". The main idea behind this awful film is that there are hundreds of ""alternate universes"" to every universe, and for every person in a universe there is another person who looks just like you with the same name in every alternate universe. So, if one person decides to kill all of his ""look alikes"" he will be giving super-human-kung-fu-action-powers. It makes perfect sense, right? If your twins are dead then you OBVIOUSLY get to know kung fu.

 Well, yeah, you were right. Besides the predictable plot, you're left with clumsy special effects, terribly obvious stunt men when the two Jet Li's are in the same scene, and enormous, gaping, plot holes.

1669572,4,B00005V1YG,"The movie in my opinion has one of the best opening scenes I've seen for an action movie. The movie got off to a fine start but pretty much drags on until the explosive finish.

I'm not sure why some people complain that it uses matrix-style effects to achieve some of the fights. There are many movies out there that set a new standard of various elements such as action, music, budgets etc. and I am actually surprised that not more movies use the matrix 'bullet-time' approach in their scenes. They needed something to show off Jet Li's inhuman speed and the 'bullet-time' approach was appropriate for it (you wouldn't want him to fight in 'fast-forward' mode would you?).

The main soundtrack of the movie is composed by Hans Zimmer who has quite a fine reputation for doing action movie soundtracks (Black Rain, The Rock, etc). The plot of the movie is original and has a lot of potential going for it. It was also a huge opportunity for Jet Li to really flesh out his acting. Which is unfortunate because this is where the movie fails to deliver. This is a plot of Highlanderesque proportions that demands longer running time! More time should have been spent developing the characters such as Yulaw and his ex-partner, showing Yulaw when he was still a cop and his eventual abomination.

Some of the story demands better acting skills, such as Jet Li dealing with the death of his wife. There is also almost no time given in the movie to show the extent of Gabriel's grief. It's not entirely Jet Li's fault; English is not his main language and he has had very little experience playing in American movies central characters who are Asian-american.

Finally, I think they could have focused on more than 1 universe (or multiverse). Imagine that one universe had a wise and skilled Jet Li who was a tibetian monk in the Himalayas; who sensed the possibility of more than one of his existences; Who knew that his destiny to fight a great enemy was drawing near and spent his days preparing for it. Then halfway through the movie we would see an epic fight between him and Yulaw, but through some deceiving and evil tactic, Yulaw gains the upper hand and murders him. Better yet, we don't know who wins, and later on it turns out that Yulaw was actually killed by the monk, but the monk himself, after beating Yulaw and 'absorbing' some of his powers and knowledge, turns to evil himself and decides to masquerade as Yulaw.

Once I was able to see it, I thought it was a very good movie, but not perfect. The concept of a multiverse makes for good sci-fi and this movie was definately interesting to me. The story goes like this: there are 123 universes that make up the multiverse, and in each universe there is a different version of each person that exists in the other universes. Jet Li plays Gabe Law, a cop in one universe. In another universe he is Yu Law, a man obsessed with power. Power and strength are divided equally among the 123 universes, and each time of of the variants dies, his power is divided among the rest of the men. So Yu Law has been illegally been traveling within the multiverse and has killed all but one of ""himself"" and himself. Sound complicated yet? It may be to some people but watching it clears a lot up. So two multiverse agents are after Yu Law since he has murdered all of the others, and Gabe Law is drawn in to stop him also. The balance in the multiverse could be destroyed if there is only one left. So that is that in a nutshell. The movie is loaded with great fight scenes and special effects that make for a visual treat. My favorite scene is in the beginning when Yu Law kills the guy while he is in police custody. Now this movie is not perfect, and it does get to a point where it gets a little dull for a while. Just be patient because it does get better, especially with the fight between Gabe and Yu Law. Some people are giving this movie negative reviews because of the unoriginality. Is it unoriginal? Perhaps to a certain extent. Are the special effects a rip-off of movies like the Matrix? Somewhat. But this isn't the first movie to copy elements from that movie and it sure will not be the last. If you are a sci-fi fan you may enjoy this movie.

1669576,3,B00005V1YG,"Van Damme tried to do it in Timecop. Schwarzenegger tried it in The Last Action Hero. It seems every action hero has to eventually face himself. Literally, by playing his twin. Jet Li decided to get a head start by doing this movie relatively early in his career.
I really didn't expect much of this movie. The plot is complex: 125 parallel dimensions exist. A member of the Multiverse Bureau of Investigation accidentally kills one of his alteregos in a parallel universe and discovers that he becomes stronger, faster, and more powerful. Realizing that, if he kills all of his multiple selves, this process can make him a god, he goes off on a killing spree in the most egregious example of self-loathing this side of sci-fidom.
WAY too many critics put this movie down for its special effects. Specifically, that the effects mimic the Matrix. So what? Seeing Jet grab two motorcycles, one in each hand, and smash a man to death with them is a thrill. He kicks cops out of thin air, dodges bullets, and jumps across buildings. That's the best part of the movie.
The problem is, Jet Li just can't act. Or I should say, he can't act well. The plot demands a lot of him -- this is a rare instance of a script being better than the actor can handle. Jet Li is supposed to weep over his wife's loss, act in multiple roles as his multiple selves, display rage, hope, madness...more than most people display in a year. Jet can't do it. His English is quite good, but he simply doesn't have the range.
And in a movie all ABOUT range, Jet can't pull it off. But that's okay, what he does is some amazing martial arts, demonstrates really cool special effects, and provides a funky plotline that inspired me enough to want to run a mini-campaign in this setting (maybe I will, hmmm).

It basicly evolves around paralel universes, and one of Jet Li's charactors in another dimension is a bad guy who in his wolrd has the ability to travel to other dimensions, and when he's there he kills the him of that paralel world and he gains there energy which makes him stronger and stronger, and the more he does it, the stronger he becomes!

1669580,4,B00005V1YG,"Okay folks, don't get your fruit-of-the-loom in a bunch about the plot, storyline or try to review this movie from a Shakespearean angle.  It's a Jet Li movie for crying out loud.  I thought the universe jumping renegade idea was unique and the people who brought you this movie put a lot of effort in it.  The DVD extras shows this and you can't help but be impress.  Now back to the movie, I found it really entertaining from an action junkie's point of view.  It's a  thrill watching Jet handcuff half a dozen Los Angeles Sheriff's officers like he was knitting a sweater. The finally fight is awesome with the good versus evil Jet Li's. He moves so effortlessly that it makes sense that he's not very tall and not very muscular. He easily runs circles around much taller and more muscular opponents. He looks great in this movie. The space age, high tech background to his martials arts was kinda different and it keeps Jet fresh and interesting to his devoted fans, but I can also imagine him winning a few Trekkie fans with this movie. Jason Statham and Delroy Lindo as Multiuniverse policemen was also a nice touch.  Statham did a pretty decent job with the American accent and Jet spoke more words in English than his previous American movies. He sounded better than I expected. Carla Gugino, the mom from Spy Kids, appears breifly as Jet's loving wife.  Their relationship adds a human side to this story, but I thought it could have been more physical and she could have played a bigger role.  I often wonder why Jet never kissed any of his leading ladies, even though he is able to convey a certain romatic  side on screen as evident in ""Romeo Must Die"".  Whenever the script calls for a love interest, the relationship is presented in a subtle way, but Jet's face is so expressive that maybe that's all that is needed.  With this movie, I've difinetly became a solid Jet Li fan.",1075334400,,1890,4.542772861356932
1669581,4,B00005V1YG,"The movie has plenty of weak spots, notably the mostly lame humor and stiff acting of most (although I don't find that Li's acting was bad at all), but the idea behind it is solid as far as sci-fi goes. The selling point, of course, is the fighting. Unlike many movies you actually get to see something interesting: Jet Li uses Bagua Zhang, a form of ""internal"" martial arts from the mid-1800s. It involves very evasive and unusual movements and its trademark circle walking (which is what he's doing practicing at his home). The final fight scenes between the two Jet Li characters is where you can really see the good Jet Li putting it to use against the bad Jet Li, who is using an other rarely seen internal martial art style called Xingyi (spellings vary). Oh, the one liner delivered by the nurse (the actress who plays Frazier Crane's agent on the TV show Frazier)is a killer. I love everthing that actress does, she hits a better comedy note out of that one line than all the other attempts at humor in the movie combined. Finally, the attempts at touching moments aren't so bad (the ending outcome for the good Jet Li is a cute idea).",1074816000,8,1143,4.5
1669582,3,B00005V1YG,"This movie has a great concept and it has Jet Li. How in the world could it have turned out so badly?
The concept is a pretty cool one. There's not just one universe, see; there's a 'multiverse'. (SF readers will already have their own list of favorite alternative-universe novels. One of mine is James Hogan's _Paths to Otherwhere_.) It's possible for people in one universe to access the others via wormholes. And for some reason, whenever one version of a person gets killed, all of that version's 'energy' gets redistributed over the ones who are still alive.
There's something of a plot based on this idea. There are 125 versions of Jet Li in the multiverse. One of him -- formerly a member of the elite corps that protects the multiverse from untoward interference -- has killed 123 of the others. The two that are left, sharing as they do the energy formerly parcelled out among all 125, are now really really fast and really really strong. And the bad one is trying to kill the good one, and thus become (drum roll, please) the One.
Okay, it's not going to pass muster with most SF readers. But with a good screenplay and the right production, it could have been a good movie; _Timecop_ suffered from similar logical problems and yet turned out to be a fine film.
This one doesn't have a good screenplay or the right production.
What it _does_ have is Jet Li, which is why I gave it three stars. The guy is amazing to watch. Unfortunately, there's not enough martial-arts stuff to sustain fans who are _watching_ it for the martial-arts stuff. And there's not enough of anything else to sustain fans who are watching it for any other reason.
It's one big Duhh after another. Is there, for example, any good reason why _these_ two Jet Lis look exactly alike (when we've already seen, via a computer-screen summary of the previous murders, that the _other_ 123 Jet Lis range from blonde to dreadlocked)? And given this exact similarity, is there any good reason for the 'good' Jet Li _deliberately_ to change into an outfit exactly like the 'bad' Jet Li's so that they'll be almost impossible to tell apart?
I'd forgive all this stuff if the plot development were even remotely interesting. It's not.
An excellent idea suffering from poor execution, then, and a dismal waste of a world-class martial artist. I won't say there's _nothing_ enjoyable about this flick, but it sure isn't the SF film it claims to be.
_The One_ wants desperately to be the next _Matrix_. Well, it just goes to show you -- there's more to a successful SF/cyberthriller than cool special effects, even if they _are_ copied from John Gaeta.",1073088000,10,2621,4.663066954643629

Before I saw this video, I honestly expected it to suck. Fortunately, it is really a great movie. It has a lot of replay value. You'll want to watch it more than once.",1066003200,,430,4.455696202531645
1669585,5,B00005V1YG,"What else could a guy ask for really?  Not only do you have Jet Li doing his martial arts thing, which he does better than anyone else working in movies today, but he finally faces a worthy opponent (himself); then there's the gorgeous Carla Gugino, who has long been one of my favorite actresses; throw in a visionary, science fiction storyline, all kinds of explosions, some pretty darn impressive CGI, and you've got yourself a movie I will gladly pay to watch.  But it gets better.  The story comes from the minds of X-Files legends Glen Morgan and James Wong, with Wong directing and Morgan serving as co-producer of the story they co-wrote.  Best of all, though, we get to see Jet Li portray a bad guy, and that is something you just don't want to miss.
Jet Li plays both of the characters at the heart of this story.  The universe of The One is not even a universe, it's a multiverse, with versions of each person existing simultaneously in each universe; all these different versions of ""you"" are connected somehow, and the power vacuum left by the death of one ""you"" is not lost but is shared equally among all of the other versions of ""you.""  Travel between the universes is possible through wormholes, and such travel is strictly policed.  When one agent discovers that he can become more powerful by killing one of his counterparts elsewhere, he becomes a renegade who knocks off 123 versions of himself to become almost all-powerful.  Lawless (the bad Jet Li) makes a spectacular escape from the universe cops and comes after the one remaining version of himself out there, Gabe Law (the good Jet Li).  Gabe has naturally been gaining in power and strength himself all this time, and this fact plus his martial arts background makes Gabe a force to be reckoned with.  The movie builds to the ultimate confrontation between these two selves, a nice twist on the struggle between good and evil.
I, for the most part, like my martial arts displays realistic and natural; if you're going to use wires and allow for all sorts of superhuman abilities, you'd better do an impressive job with the special effects.  Consider that job done in The One.  Using such devices as different film speed and CGI animation, this movie's special effects are quite impressive; Wong avoids the kind of excess you find in many a Matrix clone.  There are a couple of scenes in which the animation does not look real for a moment or two, but one can easily overlook this because the things that the souped up version of Jet Li does pretty much rock the house.  The fight scenes are in no way diminished by the use of the old hidden wire technique, and you walk away from this movie knowing you have gotten your money's worth of entertainment.  The DVD adds a plethora of special features on the making of the movie, including a commentary by Wong and crew, some good looks at the fight choreography work of Cory Yuen, a really cool animation sequence of one action scene using G.I. Joe-type figures, and another look at all of the faces of Jet Li that go to form the funniest part of the movie - as Lawless' crimes are detailed, we are shown photos of all the incredibly diverse and oftentimes hilarious guises of Jet Li's character across the multiverse.
I think The One is a fantastic, action-packed winner.  Just accept the premise of the whole multiverse idea; it works quite well so long as you don't let yourself ponder over the implications and questions the whole concept raises in your mind.  If you find yourself overanalyzing the movie's premise, just think about how gorgeous Carla Gugino is - that's the strategy I employed, and I must say it worked quite well indeed.",1065830400,,3669,4.637345679012346

The story involves alternate universes in that one particular individual has found a way to travel to alternate time lines, kill himself in these alternate time lines, and increase his own power by doing so.  He is being persued by agents from an agency that regulates this type of travel and such.  The action is great, and the special effects look amazing, but the story seemed to be lacking.

True, there are alot of special effects here, but at least Li's character(s) got a reason to be able to do all that stuff (the floundersum ROMEO, which itself was a rather unashamed [imitation] of RING OF FIRE, featured Li being able to almost literally fly around without even half an explanation)Here, it is the future and we learn there are actually 125 universes(known as the multiverse)and that there is a version of you in every one of them, all linked by an energy wave sychronizing their borths and deaths. But, if one you dies prematurely, the victim's power is redistributed to all the others. Gabriel Yulaw ( Jet Li) thinks that if all your parallel selves die, ""The One"" will become a god, so he's out to eliminate them all. He now has only one to go, LAPD deputy Gabe Law (Jet Li), setting up a final showdown between Yulaw and Gabe(whch I feel is the best fight ever filmed)Gabe must halt Yulaw's plans and save the Multiverse.

It's blown aside by what are presumably this film's only real reasons for existing: Jet Li and digital effects. Specifically, Jet Li fighting himself by virtue of digital effects. If that's what you're into, fine. You'll be satisfied with 87 minutes of pretty much that. But if you were expecting an inter-dimensional chase movie and all the fun that implies, don't waste your time: most of this unfolds in L.A.

An absolute abomination to kung-fu films (and moviedom in general), ""The One"" is an hour and a half of my life I'll never get back. I had to watch ""American Beauty"" 8 times in a row to stop feeling dirty about myself.
What's wrong about the movie? Well, if we were to count the number of groans it elicited from me ... one. One big looooooong groan, as long as the movie itself. Maybe that's REALLY to what the title referred. Apart from the ""Dragonball Z"" ""I'm a really powerful evil guy trying to get stronger and, oh wait I just need to kill this one last guy to become the STRONGEST IN THE MUTLIVERSE!"" plot, the utterly terrible soundtrack, horribly CGI-enhanced fight scenes, boring pace, laughably bad acting ... nothing! It's a perfectly fine movie!
Jet Li proves once again how badly he acts. Early Ah-nold was more convincing in ""Hercules Goes Bananas"". Every time he has an emotion, it's the same expression -- like he was just pinched. Really hard. It's sad, really. He's also a mediocre martial artist. I don't remember any of the really great kung-fu movies needing slo-mo Matrix camera moves.
Giving this movie much more in the way of a review would be almost acknowledging it as a film, so I'll stop here in a moment. I will say that the catch-22 in the movie was okay, but naturally they copped out with it in the end. Oh well. Not like it could've saved this.
If you want a kung-fu movie where the action is real, the plot is good, and you actually have a sense of reverence for the main character, rent either ""Enter the Dragon"" with Mr. Bruce ""Wataw!""

Taijiquan (Tai Chi) is by far the most widely practiced of the Chinese internal martial arts, followed by Baguazhang (Pa Kua Chang) and Xingyiquan (Hsing Yi Chuan), the one I study.
This movie features the two styles of the circular Baguazhang and the rarer, predominantly linear Xingyiquan.  So after seeing The One, I was in heaven, despite the original, yet sub par quality of the film.  Not many martial arts flicks use the internal martial arts to deliver the action, much less use them in a manner to identify the character's personalities.  Xingyi is used to show the evil Jet Li, Yu Law's intention to go straight ahead and annihilate everything in his path, like a line.  Bagua is used to portray the good Jet Li, Gabe Law's philosophy that life should be like a balanced circle.
I am also glad to see that Jet Li has been working very hard at learning the English language, and I have a lot of respect for doing so, as Chinese is very different from English.

Witness the scene in the hospital when he takes on half a dozen police, not only knocking them out but handcuffing them together and to a chair to experience his virtuosity when challenging mortal men.
The plot is one seen before, with the world as a kind of multi-universe (called a ""multiverse"").  There are an infinite number of parallel universes, and in each one there is one of us.  We are the same person in each, but different (married to the same woman in one universe, married to a guy in the next, as a bit player ""explains"").  Li illegally (of course) moves from one universe to the next, gaining strength as he kills his parallels selves until just two are left.
Amazing effects, like Li's encounter with the motorcycle cops or his Matrix-esque dodging of bullets.  But it is his martial arts ability which makes this flick.  The movies is almost a 90 minute warm up for the Li vs. Li inevitable fight, and man, that sure does not disappoint! This may well be the most amazing martial arts battle I have ever seen.

1669622,2,B00005V1YG,"The One features an extremely silly, but also very intriguing premise.  You see, our world is only one of over 100 (I can't remember the exact number, was it 125?)parallel universes that exist.  You have a different personality in another world, and if you actually travel to these other worlds and kill another version of you, then you gain his or her power.  That's exactly what Jet Li is trying to do, and there are a couple of multiverse cops out to stop him.  This is all just build-up for a big one-on-one fight between the two Jet Lis, so you're basically watching 80 minutes of B.S.
But that's not to say the idea doesn't hold any promise.  It's just that the movie ignores the concept in favor of big fight scenes.  Being an action fan and all, that's perfectly fine with me, except the action in this movie fails to generate any thrills since they're way too exaggerated and involve waaayyy too much wirework.  And is it just me or does anyone else find the premise of Jet Li fighting Jet Li incredibly lame?  The fun of watching a martial arts fight is seeing two different individuals going head-to-head, mano-a-mano.  In this case, the fight is computer-aided and not even entirely convincing.
The One does feature a few good actors, particularly Delroy Lindo and Jason Statham, both of whom are fine here, though I would have liked to have seen Statham kick a little more butt.  He's definitely got the makings of a top-notch action icon, certainly moreso than the overrated Vin Diesel. But at least we can always watch The Transporter for that (which is, by the way, a far more entertaining action thriller).
As for Li himself, he's stuck in a role that doesn't do him many favors.  First, you have to wonder how his evil self is able to find his alternate versions in all the other universes if they have different names.  Best explanation I can see is that he broke into the multiverse database and tracked down all the versions of himself out there, which actually raises another question: how does the multiverse keep track of everybody on every alternate universe?
There are the usual paradoxes of an alternate universe, that being the fact the parallel worlds can't be too different if there is a physically identical twin of yourself in all these other worlds (meaning your parents would have had to have hooked up at the exact same time for all 125 worlds) and all versions of yourself would probably have to die at the exact same time, so as to make certain no other weird influences would occur (say, one version of yourself dies suddenly, but another one goes on and marries and has kids the other one wouldn't have; kind of screws up the order, doesn't it?).  But according to this movie, not everyone dies at the same time in these alternate worlds, which begs the question of why there aren't any super-powerful geriatrics.  After all, there must be at least one old man or woman who gains all the remaining power of those who died.
Best not to think of such things with a movie like this.  Makes your head hurt after awhile.  But really, I recommend you just miss this movie altogether.  There are a couple of enjoyable moments, including a scene where Li handcuffs some cops together and to a chair, but there's too much CGI at work, not enough thrills, and certainly not enough brains to pull this premise off.

THE ONE is the kind of movie that I, myself have dreamed of making since more than ten years ago. Something that is totally over-the-edge. The fact that this movie is PG-13 (and to me, really IS PG-13) and has no abundance of cursing and void of sexual situation is mind-boggling. When was the last time Hollywood placed a big action star in a blockbuster film like that? It doesn't happen very often. As always, Jet Li's performance floors me, and of course I want him to be in one of my movies. As an aspiring filmmaker, I have no interest in merely making a movie for profit, I would also like to make great films that people can actually get something good from. Jet Li is already one of my favorite stars, probably the first Easterner I've been awed by since Toshiro Mifune (who is still my favorite actor). THE ONE is definitely a great movie, and you can't go into watching it with the mindset of a person who has no imagination. Open your mind and really try to believe everything you're seeing. The film will blow you away. ba@megadeth.com",1035504000,,1306,4.468619246861925
1669624,4,B00005V1YG,"Well, the film has its good points, but my comment is on how it is a development of an old martial arts story.
Hsing-i (xingyi) master meets pa-kua (bagua) master to find out if one style is better than the other. After several days of fighting, they eventually decide its a draw and they make a pact that from then on, a student of one style must also be a student of the other style. Supposedly, this tradition carries down to our time. Hsing-i is known for its linear movements, while pa-kua is known for its circular moves.
The ""bad Li"" used Hsing-i, but apparently did not know pa-kua. The ""good Li"" apparently knew both, first using Hsing-i in the first part of the final combat scene, but shifting dramatically to pa-kua (and winning in the process) when he did not seem to be getting anywhere with Hsing-i. (Could it be that pa-kua did not exist in the ""bad Li's"" universe? Did the Hsing-i master win in that universe, thus obliterating the pa-kua style?)
The ""bad Li"" practicing Hsing-i in prison at the beginning of the film with chains in hands and feet is reminiscent of the martial arts story above because the Hsing-i master was also fresh out of prison where he was similarly chained. The ""practice scene"" showing the ""bad Li"" practicing the linear Hsing-i while the ""good Li"" was doing pa-kua's ""walking the circle"" was a good comparison and contrast of the two martial arts technics. Really enjoyable for those who know about these arts. It would have been even more educational if the pa-kua scene showed more of the footwork. And I was really hoping that more of both arts' moves would be shown.
Well, the film was not a tutorial of the arts and the movie had to go on and make some money. However, I would have enjoyed more of the contrast of the two arts. (For example, the slow motion segments of the final fight scene graphically demonstrated the circular walking technic -- and effective application -- of pakua.)
I know this aspect of the movie would have been missed by those who did not know much about the oriental martial arts. And probably, not many would appreciate this. I just write this to show that the makers of the film drew on something from the traditions of the oriental martial arts from which the fight scenes were based. And I think they did a very good job at developing a story line based on it. Choreography of the fight scenes, in spite of the unrealistic moves, was a good representation of the two martial arts.
Right now, I keep playing back the practice and fight scenes of the movie, which I would always find enjoyable. (And no, I'm neither a pa-kua nor a hsing-i practitioner. I practice wing tsun.)

But there were holes in the movie, some of them too noticeable to ignore. For instance, if the current technology allows you to ""forecast"" WHEN a worm hole is going to materialize, why do the characters magically also have the power to change the end points of the worm hole? Why can they adjust the temporal aspect as well?
There are other holes too. If ""Gabe"" and ""T.K."" are husband and wife, why does Jet Li treat her like a sister, especially in scenes where he should show more intimate attention for the woman who is his ""center""? Why is it that in spite of all the special effects, Yulaw does things that are physically impossible, even for a person with the strength of 60 men? There seems to be a real inconsistency with the abilities of the characters. And the last why is why weren't there any deleted scenes on the dvd? Considering how many scenes are talked about in the director's commentary, why didn't they put any of them on the dvd?

1669631,2,B00005V1YG,"Like a preceding film Highlander, this film has a similar theme. One man sets out to kill his alternate selves to gain an ultimate power. There are 125 alternate universes and Gabriel Yulaw (Jet Li) is from the one which has the means to travel to all others and polices the means of that travel.
He is a former police officer of the Multiverse Authority who has discovered that by killing each of his alternate selves, he becomes faster, smarter and more powerful. His eventual aim is to kill them all and become The One. No one seems to be sure whether he'll become a god or this universe will end, in fact no-one, including Yulaw himself has any idea. It's clearly not stopping him from trying though. Obviously not a man overflowing with brotherly love when he says how his alternates are wasting their potential so he might as well be putting it to good use. Given how disreputable most of his alternates look, he does seem to have a valid point. We see him kill one of his two remaining alternates and then escape the local police before being captured by his former teammates.
He doesn't stay imprisoned for long. Thanks to an exploding rodent (!) he escapes in search of the last of his alternates. This would be Gabe, who is married to a nice vet. He is perplexed as to why he has been getting stronger and faster himself. It turns out that each surviving alternate gets equally stronger as the power is equally redistributed after each death. Yulaw has the jump on everyone else as he knows what is going on and none of his alternates know about him, let alone trying to kill him.
The fighting is very cartoon like, with people being thrown about like rag dolls, heavy objects being thrown about like styrofoam and impossible physical feats such as springing high walls in a single bound. That's the point though, it's deliberately meant to be over the top.
The problem with this very slight film (it is all but over by the 70 minute mark) is ironically that it takes too long to get to what we want to see. A full on hand to hand fight of Jet Li vs Jet Li, as opposed to all the skirmishes where the two didn't really connect up to that point. The fight is extraordinary but it takes its time getting there. In the acting department, no one really distinguishes themselves apart from Jet Li, who does put some menace into Gabriel Yulaw. There are some people in this film we would expect a lot better from. Some of the other performances are actually quite embarrassing in fact.
This is one of those films that it pays not to think too hard about. Since they would have worked out what Yulaw was up to well before getting this far, they should have been able to trap him by then. You'd also think that they'd send more than two men to get him if he was so dangerous. What especially bothered me was that for someone so powerful, they repeatedly manage to capture Yulaw again and again and if it weren't for some fortuitous (and often stupid) events allowing his escape each time, the movie would have come to an even more premature end. You especially have to worry about the people running the whole show with such decisions as to how they decide at the end which of the 2 Jet Li's is their man. I would have also thought that the number of alternate universes would have been a base 2 multiple like 128. Like I said, best not to think of these things too much.
Overall, this film is not as good as it could have been. It failed to really explore the potential of the idea it was based on. Yulaw's fate at the end of the film was intriguing though and it would be intriguing to have seen where that led. I would recommend ""Time and Tide"" (directed by Tsui Hark - non sci-fi) as a much better action film or The Matrix instead.
They should learn more from Asian cinema. If Jet Li or Jackie Chan had never made it in the US, or outside Asia it would have been our loss, not theirs. They have made some great films in Hong Kong which are worth chasing down (Once upon a Time in China and Police Story 3:Supercop) and the makers of their American films should learn more from them.
From a couple of X-Files alumni (James Wong and Glen Morgan) and was originally planned as a vehicle for Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. Well known fight choreographer Corey Yuen helped create the fights in this film. The extras on the DVD are fascinating, with 3 features about the making of the film, a lot of which dealt with the techniques used to make it look convincing that Jet Li was fighting Jet Li. It's well worth seeing these to get an insight into the complexities of movies that use a lot of special effects.
Not a huge success at the box office, with a budget of $50-60 million and grossing about $44 million in the US and Canada and about $40 million on domestic video rentals. Hopefully for the makers, the film was pushed into the black with overseas takings. Even though I was not overly satisfied with this film, I am a little curious to know what happened next and wouldn't mind an (unlikely) sequel. Will Gabe survive in a world where he has no job and shares all the identifying characteristics of a man declared dead by the authorities? Will Yulaw become King of the Hill?
Not really a very successful as a film but worth a look for the excellent fight at the end and 3 very good features about the making of the film. For some reason we didn't get trailers on the Australian disc.",1025654400,,5390,4.391

THE STORY:
A sci-fi, the film works on the premise that there are multiple universes out there and in each universe we all have counterparts.  The universe is policed by a universe hopping police force.  The evil Yulaw (Jet Li) discovers that by killing each of his counterparts in the Universe he becomes more powerful with each kill.  After offing 123 of his counterparts throughout the multiverse he arrives in our universe to take out his last remaining self, Gabe Law (Jet Li).  Can Gabe or the universe police stop Yulaw from fulfilling his goal of becoming ""The One?""
THE COOL THINGS:
Like most Jet Li films, the action and effects drive this film.  Action fans will love the many Matrix-like special effects.
BEST SCENES:
1. Yulaw versus the ""normal cops"" including a beatdown with motorcycles.
2. The movie ending Jet Li vs. Jet Li battle.
THE DVD Special Features:
This DVD is just STACKED with some of the best features I've ever seen on a DVD (and that includes A LOT) including:
1. Feature length commentary:  Always insightful...
2. Jet Li is ""The One"":  13 minute feature with commentary about the movie by the actors and actresses.
3. Multiverse:  AWESOME 18 minute feature detailing how the CGI-enhanced action sequences were filmed.
4. About Face:  6 minute piece discussing the challenges and techniques of how the scenes with multiple Jet Li's were filmed.
5. Many Faces of Jet Li:  Cool 2 minute feature showing the various Jet Li's of the multiverse.
6. Trailer for ""The One.""
7. Filmographies for:  James Wang (director), Jet Li, Carla Gugino, Jason Statham and Delroy Lindo.
8. Animatic Compression for the scene where Yulaw takes out the cops with the motorcycle.  (WAY COOL!!!)
THE VERDICT:
Whether you buy or rent it, with the cool action scenes and a half-decent story you can't go wrong with this flick.

1669635,3,B00005V1YG,"Many people might remember him as Jet Li, but for many Asian fans, he is still Li Lian Jie, a maestro of Shaolin martial arts.  Now he is gone to Hollywood, and surely we miss him, not because his skills are not to be seen on big screen, but because he is utterly ""Hollywood-nized.""  Though he is experiencing bigger things there, true fans know him through his films made in Hong Kong, and they know they are right.
""The One"" is a sort of one extended, or I should say, stretched episode of ""X-Files"" series, which the director James Wong is deeply involved.  Like his previous film ""Final Destination,"" the film is built upon one unique premise, and here we are told in the opening that the universe is in reality a muti-verse, consisting of 125 different versions of the world.  In one of them, Mr, Gore is the president of USA while in another Mr. Bush.  On the basis of that concept, now Li can play 125 versions of himself, but ... do we need to watch all of them while one of them is already formidable?
Anyway, one evil Ji, coming out of one universe, travels to kill off all other versions of him, and the last one is a good guy Li, who must confront the other Li with a help from the policemen that watch over the prohibited interactions between those universes.  As those policeman, Delroy Liodo (""Romeo Must Die"") and Jason Statham (""Lock Stock..."") appear.
Interested?  Unfortunately, the film, short as it is, doesn't  afford to hold our attention long as it sounds on paper, simply because of these following clear factors.  Reason One: Li is a great action hero on his own, who doesn't need any other ""one"".  Reason Two: the fact is that we have seen similar settings already; say, for example, ""The Matrix""  (And you may be reminded of ""Timecop"" with its alternate world image and the multi-universe cops.)  The film starts promisingly, but soon we realize that it has little to offer after it sets up its whole rules.
The actions themselves are shot very excitngly, thanks to, of course, Li's nimble movements, but CGI generated scenes are, to be frank, below average, sometimes looking as unnnatural as characters on TV games (but excuse me for saying that, if that is exactly the point).  The final battle between the good Li and bad Li is fairly exciting, but still there sticks one little though in my mind while watching it -- that is, why need two Lis when one is great and cool enough?  And as for Carla Gugino (mom of ""The Spy Kids""), the director is hugely guilty of misusing her, wasting her beautiful and sexy presence, and  totally ignoring her  potential as playing more than a secondary, disposable character.  The way she is used is as misguided as letting Jet Li hold guns (does he need?), and the latter kind of Hollywood-type action is obviously a dead giveaway that they still don't learn the essence of Li's actions.
I said these harsh things because, so far, Ji's Hollywood-made movies are not well-received in Asia, and though we still follow the master's path, namely from ""Lethal Weapon 4"" to ""The One,"" we don't know for sure; don't know what to do with them.  if you really want to know what Li can do with his charismatic acting as one-and-only action hero, see his ""Once Upon a Time in China"" series.  What he needs is the director Tsui Hark's flair for presenting genuinely thrilling, outrageously exciting martial arts jet-coaster sequence.",1023062400,2,3388,4.626043405676127

1669641,3,B00005V1YG,"I'm being a bit generous with my rating this time.  Jet Li's previous two Hollywood outings, Romeo Must Die and Kiss of the Dragon, are so incredibly bad that I've kept my expectations low.
Happily, The One delivers in much grander style than any Li film since Lethal Weapon 4.  Is it a cinematic masterpiece?  No.  Is it an emotional tour de force?  Negative.  But is it enjoyable, and does it deliver excitement and entertainment?  I would definitely say so.
I was originally suspicious of the PG-13 rating.  Action films and the PG-13 rating don't tend to mix well.  But director James Wong (Final Destination) is imaginative enough that the PG-13's usual restrictions aren't a big hurdle for him.  Though some of the special effects and production design look quite cheesy (the ""wormhole"" device looks like a Zoom drum machine!), the whole package is delivered with enough sense of fun to make you suspend disbelief.
Li hasn't quite overcome his linguistic limitations, but Wong was smart to evoke in Li the villainy that had made his Lethal Weapon 4 turn so interesting.  And freed of the pretensions towards condescending, Oriental mystical nonsense (as in Romeo Must Die and Kiss of the Dragon), we can relate to Li's character much more.  Carla Gugino doesn't exactly get the deepest role here, but she's very likeable and provides Li with his first believable love interest, and Delroy Lindo just steals the show with a hilarious, surprising dual-role appearance.  His second entrance is easily the funniest moment in the film.  And Jason Statham manages to make us forget those awful Guy Ritchie movies from which he came.
The script moves along briskly and the pacing is tight, the fight sequences very well staged and shot, with extra marks going to the slam-bang sound effects.  Sure, some of the techniques look similar to The Matrix, but they're still fun to watch.
My biggest complaint is the ending.  Won't give it away here, but emotionally, it's a complete let down.  Gabe's reaction to the tragedy is not credible; the ""final twist"" feels incredibly forced, as if contriving to avoid a down ending; and the final prison fight looks gratuitous.

Sad to say, I was greatly underwhelmed by 'The One'.  The concept (while fascinating) is handled in b-movie fashion with an above-average budget, with special emphasis placed on all the wrong things.
One of the reasons that 'Kiss Of The Dragon' was so effective was that they kept the slow-motion camera work to a minimum, leaving us to be entertained by Jet Li's naturally fast reflexes and superb choreography, not to mention a great soundtrack.
In 'The One', it's bad enough that the script is virtually non-existant, the action is far from Li's best, and the comic-book rendering of his fights detract from his greatest strength: real-time combat.
I laughed every time they brought the camera onto the 'tracking device', which they did 3 or 4 times at least.  The director must have thought to get the most out of that particular effect by doing so, and the result is comical at best.
Especially bad is the final fight scene, which is overlong, and unimpressive.  I can only hope that Jet Li either a) fires his agent, or b) picks a much better vehicle for his next film.  It certainly won't get any worse than this.",1018828800,,1360,4.677824267782427

The soundtrack is awesome, with songs like; ""Down With the Sickness"" by Disturbed, and ""Last Resort"" by Papa Roach.
But however, do not, i repeat, DO NOT compare this with Jet Li's Chinese flicks (like the OUATIC SERIES, TWIN WARRIORS, AND FONG SAI YUK, and so on) or you will be VERY disappointed, cuz this movie is TERRIBLE compared to Jet's Chinese flicks.

1669644,5,B00005V1YG,"Every once in a while someone films a movie that really does have a new take on its genre. Even if the general idea existed, it either was not, or could not, be done well on film before. James Cameron's _The Terminator_, Ridley Scott's _Alien_ and _Blade Runner_, Lucas' _Star Wars_, and Spielberg's _Jaws_ and _Close Encounters of the Third Kind_ all achieved this in one way or another.
_The One_ enters this select company both by virtue of originality (I have seen the general premise once or twice before, but never on film) and because even had someone attempted this before, it couldn't have been done as well.
The basic idea of _The One_ is that there are a large number of parallel dimensions, each with a slightly different history (in this one, George Bush became president; in another, it might have been Dole, Gore, or someone even less likely). In each of these universes exists a parallel version of ourselves, as we would be if we'd grown up there. In one of these universes, dimensional travel has been perfected; people can go from one to the other. And one of those people discovers that if he kills off his duplicates, he becomes stronger, faster, smarter; there is some kind of mystical connection between all these parallels, and the power of all is divided up among those that are left; accordingly, he's travelling through the dimensions, slowly eliminating all his parallel selves. The hero of our story is his last remaining duplicate, who has been trying to understand what has been happening to him recently.
Scenes involving such superhuman abilities simply couldn't be done well before this, and few actors other than Jet Li would be able to pull them off convincingly even with special-effects assistance. The pacing is excellent, the plotline fascinating (the bad guy's being chased by a couple of dimensional cops who have an additional concern beyond the fact that this guy's committing multiple homicides: according to some dimensional theory, if he succeeds in eliminating all the others, it will cause a cataclysm), and the action is simply top-notch.
The ending is surprising, and extremely cool. It leaves the possibility of a sequel open, but doesn't require one, either. Highly recommended. If action's your thing, this one will deliver.",1018742400,12,2278,4.950391644908616

The script is completely banal, a rehash of movies I'm sure I've seen before.  Jet Li's talents are wasted, as instead of doing actual fight sequences, he has to fight against himself (meaning lots of fights with computer inserted images, or other stunt men who get their face replaced), and it robs from the intensity of the fights.

Although some people complain about how every fight scene was done with strings, I don't mind it at all mainly because this is a science fiction movie and the goal for the main character in this movie is to become the best, become the ONE.. so I felt the string touch was very appropriate.

1669651,3,B00005V1YG,"Jet Li is a bad guy jumping from universe to universe killing his alter-egos and thus becoming stronger and stronger.  As only 2 Jets remain in the end, they can move at inhuman speeds, and thus the fight scenes have a Matrix-bullet-time quality to them in which Li fights at normal speed while everything else moves in super slow-motion.  And that, my friends, is everything good and interesting about this movie.
The One is a b-grade movie, with terrible dialog, confusing plot points, and rather bad acting.  Think of a bad Van Dahme or Segal movie and you'll understand ""The One.""  The interesting premise of jumping from universe to universe is never fleshed out or explored, nothing on the level of Highlander or that Star Trek episode with Evil Kirk.  The special effects are interesting to watch, but they are strung together haphazardly, and it makes no sense that Li can lift up motorcycles and dodge bullets one moment but can get knocked down by a slow, powerless bunch the next.  The plot doesn't even bother to explain many of its silly action scenes, it just introduces them.  I was touched by the honest romance between Li and Carla Gugino, but that's all.
I am a huge fan of Jet Li, but I found this to be one of his worst films in terms of martial arts and action.  The fighting is very sparce and except for a duel in the end, nothing shows of Li's skill or talent.  If you want a true sense of Li's genius, buy ""Fist of Legend"" or ""Once Upon a Time in China.""

1669652,2,B00005V1YG,"The story was simple: there are 125 parallel universes, and every person has a counterpart in each one.  When someone dies, their speed, strength, and intelligence are divided among the remaining counterparts. In some of these universes, they have discovered how to dimension jump through the use of wormholes. Evil Jet Li has used dimension jumping to see out and kill 123 of his counterparts, giving him superhuman abilities, and has come to our earth to take out the last one and achieve god-status.
The only reason I gave this movie two stars was the opening action scene in the prison garage.  Evil Jet Li physically overcomes five police that are shooting at him in the neatest display of slow motion 'Matrix' effects I've ever seen.  I'm almost tempted to buy the DVD just for that scene.  Also, I think Jet Li's acting is getting better.  I think he's more skilled at acting than Van Damme or Seagal ever were and you can see the improvements between each film.  Still, I wouldn't have him do Shakespeare.
With those two positive aspects noted, I'll turn to the negatives.  First, and most importantly, the whole premise needed some serious doctoring.  If the death of each parallel universe counterpart strengthened the remaining persons, retirement homes around the world would be loaded with superfast, superstrong grandmothers and grandfathers.  It would have taken the director minimal effort to insert a scene showing the villian use some device that spreads the victim's energy to the survivors.  Or, one added sentence from Delroy Lindo's partner to Good Jet Li could have explained, ""He has to kill you near an open wormhole or else your energy just disperses"".  Instead, a gaping plot hole is left.
The film was only an hour and 20 or 25 minutes.  They could have padded it out with scenes of the Good Jet Li adapting to his newfound speed and strength, both before he meets his evil counterpart and afterwards.  That would have made the story much more interesting, provided a stronger attachment to the main characters, and giving more of a buildup and resolution.
Finally, Delroy Lindo and his partner spend half the film trying to apprehend the villian with futuristic guns they aren't permitted to use.  Why weren't they given tasers or dart guns?  Several times they unsuccessfully attempt to handcuff at gunpoint a villian they know can dodge bullets.  Instead, they could have shot him in the back with a drugged dart and cuffed him while he slept.  With his enhanced abilities, he could have overcome the drug quickly and escaped.  Same net result, but more believable story.
My advice is, rent it only if you're a Jet Li nut who likes Matrix-style scenes.  Otherwise, don't waste your money.  Instead, I recommend ""Kiss of the Dragon"", which was only marginally better plot-wise, but contained many superb action scenes.  However, KotD used very few wires and slow motion scenes.",1016668800,2,2907,4.915983606557377

""We"" have the ability to travel to each one through use of quantum tunneling and traveling through wormholes, although it is illegal. In each different universe there is a different version of you. A former agent who helped secure the wormholes was forced to defend a form of himself in another universe, and failed to do so. After the death of his alter universal counterpart (...) he found that he grew stronger and faster and from there he started to move on, hopping to different universes, killing ""himself"". Now hes reached the last one, our universe, and Gabe Law (the protagonist) must defend against himself, Yulaw (the antagonist) in order to keep him from becoming the One. If Yulaw does become the One, there are 3 possibilities. The whole system implodes, the whole system explodes, or Yulaw becomes a god.
This movie is definetely Jet li's best american movie  ...It features some awesome bullet time sequences but what makes them so special in The One is that they are used with hand to hand combat aswell as shooting. The way the one uses the bullet time is, in my opinion, a lot cooler than in the Matrix. Another good thing is that they use it a lot.
The acting in the movie is quite good, considering Jet Li cannot fluently speak English. Some of the stuff can be hard to understand from time to time.
The One is a great action film and has action sequences on par or maybe even cooler then the Matrix's. I would definetely check this one out.",1016064000,,1551,4.579136690647482
1669666,1,B00005V1YG,"At an early point in ""The One,"" actor Jet Li is strapped to a steel chair, a transport of some kind, and makes the remark, ""The multiverse, every universe in it, is irrational and sloppy."" Take away the scientific nature of that statement, and what you have is a perfect description of writer/director James Wong's martial arts actioner, a recycle bin of old ideas and action sequences, turgid characters and ludicrous plotting. In short, it may very well be one of the worst films ever made.
From the very first line, a campy narration that reveals the ""multiverse,"" composed of over one hundred separate universes, I got the feeling that the film had nowhere to go. Seconds later, we're taken to a prison in one of the various universes, where inmate Lawless is being removed from his cell for execution. Played by Jet Li, Lawless is soon gunned down in cold blood by Yulaw, also played by Jet Li. It is here that we learn Yulaw's agenda, hopping from universe to universe, killing his aliases and attaining their strength to become the one and only.
Despite capture efforts on the part of the Multiverse Agency, who fear the imbalance of power as a result of Yulaw's killing spree, our fearless, cocky antihero escapes to yet another universe, carrying two bumbling Agency deputies along for the ride. He plans to seek out and destroy Gabe (once again played by Jet Li), a Los Angeles police officer who loves his veterinary wife and has a dog for a pet (so much for characterizations, huh?).
The film is a classic case of a bad premise made even worse by lack of imagination on the part of its makers. Let's forget for a moment that the plot recycles bits and scraps from various films, recalling such twists as the old ""Which one is the good guy?"" trick meant to throw us off the track. Not only is such a tactic completely clichd and overused, but it burdens the film with predictability, lacking even the good sense to at least try to reverse our initial guess.
Even the film's countless scenes of joyless, uninspired action are also to blame. Director Wong seems to have a ""Matrix"" fetish; if the abundance of bullet-dodging sequences, in which a character quickly ducks out of harm's way while the camera trails with the bullet itself, isn't proof of Hollywood's lack of originality, then nothing ever will be. The martial arts fight sequences will no doubt draw comparison to films like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" but, despite their well-staged appearance, they lack any sort of energy or intensity. Oh, and did I mention the big payoff sequence, a finale with sparks and slow-motion photography that will surely remind younger viewers of the final showdown from Disney's ""The Lion King?""
The film's biggest problem is Jet Li himself, who plays a plethora of characters, but can't manage a single worthy performance as any of them. His arrogance and wit in the role of Yulaw are unaffecting and run-of-the-mill, and he seems more focused on those two traits than he does in making this antagonist into a fearsome figure. Since Gabe is little more than a pawn in Yulaw's game of chess, the story gives us little reason to care whether or not he lives or dies. In fact, by film's end, you may find yourself pleading with the writers to just kill them both and end it all.
The good news is, Li looks right at home with the material. The bad news is, this debacle feels about as entertaining as an MRI. ""The One"" does succeed in inciting us to question the lucidity and good judgment of its characters and writers, whose efforts never rise above juvenile. Martial arts aficionados will undoubtedly embrace the film with such praiseful compliments as ""breathtaking"" and ""eye-popping."" Consider it a mercy killing.",1015977600,3,3725,4.75

The killer has found a way to get almost immortal by going to each of the 125 alternate dimensions and killing himself in each, thus the life energy is spread to the survivors.

I've noticed several other DVDs that do this such as ""Toy Story 2"", and wonder if other people realize this.  I also wonder how can DVD publishers get away ripping customers off with fake widescreen DVDs.  Something needs to be done so DVD publishers stop ripping off customers this way in order to reduce their own production costs, at the expense of the customer.

There are lots of good things about this movie, not least being the wonderful marshall arts choerography or the tantalising thought of Jet Li in action against himself! The storyline is not a new one for science fiction fans as the alternative universe concept has been around for years. Indeed Michael Morcock has turned it into an almost comic book art form. But it has not been given a real airing on the big screen. As an aside this particular idea is a real theory in cosmology and one which is gaining a large number of adherents. Getting back to the movie, there is a pretty good plot which only starts to unravel after the movie is about half-way through. Jet Li once again demonstrates that the martial arts genre has more to offer than the clownish antics of Jackie Chan, and that there is a more artistic and darker side to it. His most recent roles suggest that Li will become an even bigger star as he certainly has a greater breadth than Chan.
Now to the downside. There are some contradictions within the plot certainly. It takes 123 deaths to give the bad guy the strength and everything else he accrues on his way to being the One but for the good guy, he only starts to gain this as he becomes the target. The real problem with this movie for me is the close resemblances to Highlander and Timecop. Not so much in the actuality as Li is not choppoing off the heads of others but killing versions of himself, nor is he time travelling and trying to restore a situation but in the rather lame Van Damme storylines and devices. A better perspective would have been the sort of Millenium approach which certainly was a darker view.
The ending was a bit naff too particularly on the Hades universe where it ended up looking like a Playstation game but all set up for a sequel.

The One was beautifully done and the idea is great. It's just that the story is just a front for the action, not the action being a part of the story. I love Kung Fu movies and I love Sci Fi. I was hoping for a skilled marrying of the genres a la the Matrix. I would watch it again as a special effects/martial arts flick, but I wish I hadn't bought it.",1015372800,,501,4.122448979591836
1669683,5,B00005V1YG,"I would highly recommend buying this DVD.  It is his third good film in America since Lethal Weapon 4...in which he was a total bad boy.  This movie has it all, good Jet and bad Jet...although rooting for either is a mute point.  I liked how they are now incorporating love interests in his movies and this one plays it off very purely.  The only complaint i could possibly have is the mainstream music which kind of cheapens the effect similar to the other American Li movies where rap is played.  This movie has quite a lot of deep symbolism and evokes the answer to the universal question: ""in a fight between me and evil me who would win?"" I am buying this movie as soon as it comes out on DVD...exactly in the same manner as ""Kiss of the Dragon""",1015200000,,750,4.290780141843972

I enjoyed this movie not this time as much as the ""KISS OF DRAGON"" or the ""ROMEO MUST DIE"" for the really cool karate movements of Jet Li, including the adventure of the film. But, what really impressed me was the introduction of the pioneering idea of multi-dimensional universes and time by the director James Wong.

1669687,3,B00005V1YG,"I happened to see this flick y'day. What I liked was the storyline - the concept of Multiverses and the Balancing of the same excited me a great deal only to be thoroughly disappointed by the below-the-line performances. Apart from a few kicks, Jet Li is nothing in the movie. Wish they were more lines than the usual kicks and punches.
Jet Li's twin in another universe is out on the run to become the one by intaking all the energies of the other look alikes in other universes. The last one left: Jet Li of course! There are multiverse cops, ways of execution, and the works.
It could have been made better by a more gripping storyline!",1014508800,,639,4.423728813559322
1669688,1,B00005V1YG,"This movie was horrible, I actually fell asleep during it. Even someone who can see a movie just for the special effects or martial arts will be disappointed.

I've seen his great real action in many other HongKong movies, and also known he was one fo the yngest champ in a martial art contest in China. It proves he's real. This movie is just like any other American SCIFI movie. But it tries to appeal it's more like a martial art movie with Jet Li's action. Unfortunately, it doesn't work to me. If you wanna see nice SF, then you'll be satisfied with this movie. If you wanna see his real martial art without any SF, then you should get ""Shaolin Temple"" which is the eariest movie of Jet Li.",1014163200,,594,4.3125

1669693,1,B00005V1YG,"This movie is a waste of time. I saw it in a double feature with ""Serendipity,"" a romance comedy, which is billion lightyears ahead of this lousy movie.
This movie's plot is cheap. To let two Let Li's fight each other, they used the ""parallel universe."" It's plain stupid. It does not hold a single drop of water. Now if you live in the same universe as the one I live, this movie is cheesy. I think some of this movie's praisers are actually from another universe. This movie is the worst thing ever, in this particular universe.
Jet Li is a good fighter. He could fight. All the movie magics used in this movie, only weakened his supposed-to-be-solid performance. I heard one said with all the tricks used, they could get Julia Roberts play the leading role. You use so much tricks only if you can't fight. This movie wastes Jet Li's otherwise wonderful talents.",1013558400,5,864,4.544871794871795

I say to all the people looking for drama and or a touchy feel good story, i don't know why you bother with watching kungfu films anyway!!",1013385600,,359,4.454545454545454

1669696,3,B00005V1YG,"Well, I liked this movie only becouse of the special effects.
The story line about 126 universes and that you live in them at the same time, well, let's just say that the story was kind of bad. I mean, what if one of ""you"" dies in an accident, or what if one ""you"" are in prison, while another ""you"" are married and stuff? The prison ""Jet-Li"" hadn't any wife, but other ""ones"" had... And that scene where Al Gore was chosen as president over America, I mean: PARALLELLS!
The movie was like a fan movie, becouse the ideas weren't any good, and we have seen many of them in other movies. Anyway, I have this movie on DVD only for the special effects, none more.

1669697,5,B00005V1YG,"""The One"" is a ground-breaking special effects extravaganza with twice the explosive action, twice the gravity-defying martial arts, and twice the Jet Li! ""The One"" calls the attention to Jet Li as Yulaw, a Multiverse agency renegade who has the ability to travel into alternate and parallel universes and grows stronger with every person that he kills. But for Yulaw to become ""the one"", he will have to face his ultimate challenge yet...himself! That's right! He faces against another Jet Li as Gabe, a police officer who leads a carefree life with his lovely wife (Carla Gugino, ""Snake Eyes""). But Gabe's life is suddenly shattered when Yulaw enters the present world and attempts to kill Gabe off in order to be the last one standing...but not before two Multiverse agents (Delroy Lindo, Jason Statham) can stop Yulaw first. So, basically it's a fight to the death for both Gabe and the ruthless Yulaw. ""The One"" is the most action-packed, most entertaining Jet Li movie ever made since ""Romeo Must Die"", ""Lethal Weapon 4"", and ""Kiss of the Dragon""! ""The One"" is definitely ""the one"" DVD you must own A.S.A.P.!",1012262400,2,1114,4.8994708994708995
1669698,5,B00005V1YG,"Jet Li made history with this movie: for the first time someone used Hsing Yi and Ba Gua, two great fung fu styles (older brothers of famous Tai Chi). Jet Li also introduces himself as great master of those styles.
Movie itself is an average Science Fiction movie, an interesting idea of parallel worlds (they called it ""multi-verse"" instead of universe), there are 125 of them. I still haven't figured out why filmmakers took this number. The only weak explanation for it, that I have, is that 5 times 5 times 5 is 125, and there are 5 basic elements in taoism. Most of the movie is logicaly well built, but there are no revolutionary inventions or ideas. There are few special effects that I liked, like to make a very fast fight scene and to show it in slow motion. It looks much more persuasive this way, but Jet Li is brilliant martial artist and he does not need special effects to impress.
I gave 5 stars mostly because Hsing Yi and Ba Gua, from artistic point of view, I would say 3.5 from 5",1012262400,,999,4.376344086021505
1669699,3,B00005V1YG,"This film uses a premise that is really cool. But it serves only as an elaborate backdrop for the action. Jet Li is an interesting actor. I did't really take him seriously until I saw Kiss of the Dragon. The idea that he actually has a wife that he cares for is unconvincing. On the other hand, this movie boasts some of the best action sequence special effects ever, like when he kicks 4 cops in the air before the first one hits the ground. Certainly a good rent.",1012176000,,465,4.235955056179775

The best part is not only the Jet Li vs Jet Li its in the begining when it shows Jet Li kill another Jet Li and beat the 'crud' out of like 10 police officers. The slow motion when Jet Li is in normal motion captures just how movies have evolved after the matrix. which ones better?
