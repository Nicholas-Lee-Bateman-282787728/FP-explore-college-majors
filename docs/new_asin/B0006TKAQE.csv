8378763,4,B0006TKAQE,"The Colgate Comedy Hour was a variety show with a rotating selection of hosts.  These three episodes are good choices from the episodes hosted by Abbott & Costello.  The comedy sketches by the boys, some of which were not seen anywhere else, are dominated by the musical numbers, which are great too.  The picture and sound quality are good considering they were essentially done live and the videotape process was fairly primitive in the 1940s.  Most of the guest stars I had never heard of, but the best of the episodes was the tribute to President Eisenhower with guest Victor Borge whom I loved in his PBS specials.  However, the disc is stuck in a slot packaged in a cheap cardboard box which is prone to crushing and scratching.  The first thing I did when I received it was move it to a sturdier case and color copied the box cover to make sleeve art for it.  Recommend also getting the Abbott & Costello Colgate Hour colorized Christmas special sold separately.",1471737600,,969,4.631578947368421
