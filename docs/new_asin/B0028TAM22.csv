8357038,1,B0028TAM22,"Knowing the truth from behind the scenes of the making of this DVD, this movie should never have been produced or released, and I'm sorry after so many years it's still in production/distribution. I believe the producers meant their best in making this movie and I don't wish to cast any blame on them, but the end result is a movie that is full of half-truths and missing facts. It is a beautiful story, full of hope and redemption, love and grace... and everyone wants more of that, plus miracles. But the missing facts are like cracks in the foundation of the story, and the main characters fell into those cracks. I know this firsthand, because I was one of those main characters in the story. The storyline is misleading and alters reality, creating an illusion.",1386201600,9,767,4.647058823529412
