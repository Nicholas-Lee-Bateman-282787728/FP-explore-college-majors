I like his free flowing style of painting and as I enjoy quick sketches. Do not get me wrong.  This is not easy, but I am practicing with the tools that I have. I especially like the way he incorporates color with drawings.  It has spirit, spontaneity, and character. A truly worthwhile book to have and to use especially when the artist wants to loosen his/her work.

8509395,5,B0073T1Z0U,I love this DVD. I heard about it from a friend and took a chance on it and then got the book too. I'm so glad I did. It has opened up new ways to make my drawings better... and more interesting.

8509396,5,B0073T1Z0U,"I wanted to learn some different ways of doing figures. I bought this video because I was bored with the usual kinds of drawing. I was afraid I might be disappointed with this but I love the ideas on this DVD and am making better drawings because of it. Thanks, Mr. Buchman. It is different from the Art Is an Attitude DVD but for me just as good. The advice about the materials is very helpful, too. I am getting the book next.",1375142400,,428,4.168674698795181
8509397,4,B0073T1Z0U,"See my 5 star review of Bill Buchman's DVD ""Art is an attitude"" and his book ""Expressive figure drawing"" (you could call this DVD Figure Drawing I).

Zen Breakthrough Figure drawing techniques: you could call this DVD: Figure drawing II.

As with most film sequels the original film I is great, and the sequel II is a bit less.
Alas also in this case. Let me tell you why this is my opinion.

- The sequel DVD II is primarily more of the ""same"", as the original DVD I.
Similar excercises with similar, in style, outcomes; drawings. No real surprises. This however doesn't really bug me, because I had expected it, and more, even similar, demonstrations were welcome for me. Buy the way the DVD starts pretty boring, but gets a lot better later on.
Primarily gesture drawing, line, line and wash, etc. In my view the drawings in this DVD are even more freer and looser then in the original; the counter side of that is they don't look like anyone (see further below).

- If you would say: the sequel II is a sales promotion DVD I would believe you.
Bill offers his own line of Sumi brushes and Reed pens, and there are a lot of demonstrations with them; they are heavily promoted.
Further it looks to me that other drawing material suppliers/producers are sponsor/producers of this DVD.
Yes the excercises work well with the materials promoted, but in my view similar excercises can work very well with other materials, brands as well.
To be clear I don't say the above is the case, I don't know, it is just the impression I get when I look at the DVD.

- The DVD works a little less convenient.
E.g. if you don't look at the whole DVD in one go, but look at in parts: every time you start the DVD you first have to go through ""promotions"", ""commercials"", this is not the case in the original. And the menu works less convenient then in the original.

- For me the most important disadvantage of this sequel, DVD II is the following:
As most figure drawing teachers emphasize it is very important to work with live, 3D models, and not with flat, 2D, photos. In the original we saw a live model, who moved (into the pose) and we could recognise as an individual person (e.g. recognise her face) this gives the impression of a live model as in a live model drawing class.
In the sequel, DVD 2 Bill appears to work from photos. I never see the model move (into the pose, or move a little while being in the pose, or move out of the pose), I can not recognize her face (she is on very large distance, out of focus), I only see a completely still figure, a photo. To me it doesn't look at all like drawing a live model as in a live model drawing class but it looks like drawing from a photograph.
To make things even worse: in my opinion the lightening of the model is very ugly (I have never seen lightening on a model like this): the torso is lightened far too much and you hardly see the head, hands and feet; they are in deep shade. This also highlights that Bill draws ""no"" head, hands, feet in his drawings. In my view Bill doesn't draw people/inviduals (based on his drawing you can't recognise who it is), Bill doesn't draw figures (whole people, with head, hands and feet) , but Bill draws bodies (torso with a large part of the legs and arms), which he calls gestures.
I think you might just as well draw still life's, made of meat (not my view on figure drawing, I draw human beings, individuals).
So if you want (creative) drawings where you recognise who is drawn (without making a portrait), or if you want to express the nonverbal communication (expression of mood, emotion, etc.) of hands (even a suggestion of a hand can say so much, as e.g. Rembrandt has shown), or the expressiveness of feet, you need to get that elsewhere.

- Never change a winning team. The original was well filmed/produced. In the sequel I see
an inconveniently working DVD, an unprecedented ugly lighting of the model, and then another big flaw in the bonus. Bill is interviewed, and on the background you obviously see people breaking down the film set where the DVD was shot; very distracting, very ugly, a very stupid idea.

Overall: the price of this DVD is very favourable, you get more than two hours of demonstrations, in a variety of materials, which for me was welcome, Bill is an inspired and capable teacher and artist, so good value for money, alas the sequel in my view is really a step less than the original, so four stars.",1371168000,4,4424,4.426289926289926
8509398,5,B0073T1Z0U,"Bill Buchman does a fine job of demonstrating the various options one has in doing wonderful free and loose figure drawings. I highly recommend this DVD for those who need help in breaking out of a tight, constrained style of drawing the figure. I am just such an artist so this DVD is the perfect cure for me. The methods and materials he recommends are top quality so there is a consideration as to how serious one is in acquiring those materials but that is of course relative to what you want to accomplish with your art. This is a definite winner presentation and I recommend it to anyone interested in expanding their approach to figure drawing.",1357776000,,651,4.572649572649572

ZEN BREAKTHROUGH: Figure Drawing Techniques
With Bill Buchman
[...]
For beginning artists or advanced or professional.
Color/DVD.  133 min.  Nude art model.

The greatest thing about Bill Buchman is that he always keeps sight of the whole point of art for us artists.  At its heart, art should be fun and creative.  In all his DVDs and in his wonderful book Expressive Figure Drawing, Mr Buchman continually reminds us of the magic of art.

Gentle and soft-spoken, Mr Buchman spends well over two hours with us on this DVD, encouraging us to -- and, as an experienced teacher, showing us *how* to -- open up our art, patiently demonstrating equipment and techniques, skillfully blending the ancient with the new, from fine Asian sumi brushes and bamboo-reed pens (with his own hand-ground ink!) to Sennelier oil pastels and Cretacolor Aquabriques.
Floating on a subtle undercurrent concentrating on the ideas of energy, flow, harmony, fusion, freedom, simplicity, and freedom, most of the instruction time is spent creating ""gesture"" paintings -- very free, loose renderings where you the artist move your hand and arm according to what you see  --  using sumi brushes, a particulaly apt choice for Mr Buchman's unique attitudes and techniques, because they are designed to bring out the expressiveness of the gesture.  Mr Buchman teaches how to use mass and line together to capture the essence of what you see:  ""that's all you need,"" he says.

This DVD will not teach you detailed, exacting techniques (which I personally love and covet addictively; I always yearn to learn more) to render the figure more precisely.  And you may end up with no ""finished"" paintings ready for sale on your gallery wall.  But we all know deep down that the most perfect technique without imagination and expressiveness becomes sterile.  It's refreshing to stretch and face new challenges, if only for your own expanding artistic soul.  ""We learn by doing,"" says Mr Buchman reassuringly.  We can think of this DVD -- in fact, all of Mr Buchman's teaching books and productions -- as an investment similar to going on a relaxing and enlightening zen retreat with a wise and gentle master, but while relaxing in your own home or studio and at a tiny fraction of the cost.

(There are some small production shortcomings to this DVD's art-materials list (print too small) and bonus interview (unidentified guys inexplicably walking around behind Mr Buchman), but these flaws don't feel important -- Mr Buchman's teaching is the valuable jewel here.)

Courage leads to vitality.  Bill Buchman, who is also a jazz musician, actually *encourages* us to have the courage to take risks, make mistakes, and see what happens. ""Don't be afraid to try this,"" he says.  ""Don't let your analytical mind get in the way.""  Keep moving, keep reacting.  Don't get too fussy, because making it too precise takes the spirit and vitality out of it.  Being more free is a good thing, and it will make you a better, more expressive artist.

Someone once said you cannot discover new oceans without the courage to lose sight of the shore.
 The whole point of Zen, I think, is that the process is more important than the product -- to release the arrow is more important than having perfect aim.  This DVD is about CREATING EXCITING ART AS A BLOSSOMING, ADVENTUROUS EXPERIENCE.
And this DVD can truly reinvigorate your art with spirit and spontaneity.
I heartily recommend it, for artists of all levels.

8509402,5,B0073T1Z0U,"Just finished watching this DVD for the second time since receiveing it 2 days ago. I have to say, this one is just as good as all the other ones (and I have all of them.) I've gotten something from all but this one brought it into focus for me. I had not realized how boxed in I had become, compartmentalizing my art practice into watercolor,acrylic, sumi e, or drawing practice. Thinking along the lines of well, today I'll do a watercolor, so put all the inks and acrylics away. Or I think I'll draw today, so away with all water media. What I got from this DVD was a way of seeing the possibilities for interaction among media...(I'm a slow learner.) Bill's approach and techniques really opened my eyes with some basic concepts like ""all water media are friendly towards each other..."" I think I got up at that point and dropped some acrylic paint on a watercolor, then drew with some ink, grinning all the while...
Whatever your level of skill, I believe this DVD will provide inspiration, instruction and some common sense advice. Bill's teaching style is very accessible and enjoyable. I highly recommend this as well as all of Bill's other DVD's.",1329264000,10,1155,4.611650485436893
