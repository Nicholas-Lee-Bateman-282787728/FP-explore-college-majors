8306212,5,B001GN3J2G,"As an acupuncture student, I was looking to add to my massage/tuina repertoire when I came across this gem.  This DVD definitely gives you excellent, detailed instruction of the very basic techniques of shiatsu bodywork for prone, side and supine positions.

What I love about this DVD is that the delivery of the information is phenomenal because of her demonstration of the technique being as clear as her verbal instruction.  Not only does she explain things in a way that even non-bodyworkers can understand, but through the use of the correct camera angles, you can see clearly the correct practitioner body positioning and application to maximize the benefits of this art.  Despite the fact that this is primarily bodywork done on the floor, I have been able to use this in a clinical setting on tables.

I definitely recommend this to anyone who would like to broaden their repertoire in professional bodywork, practitioners of eastern medicine, or even to amateurs who just want to add this to their collection of life's skills.",1262736000,3,1036,5.0
