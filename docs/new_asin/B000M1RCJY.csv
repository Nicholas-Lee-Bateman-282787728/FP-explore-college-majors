8165648,5,B000M1RCJY,"Sleeping Murder:

""Very dangerous to believe people; I haven't for years""

This film is an excellent adaptation of Agatha Christie's book. The actors were well chosen. Graldine Alexander and John Moulder-Brown is a convincing newly wed couple. The couple gets to solve the lion's share of the mystery with guidance from Miss Marple of who warned them not to pursue the mystery. The location is beautiful and requires a vision of the sea. As with most Marple mysteries everyone and no one did it. In fact we are not sure that there was an ""it"" to did.
So get out your teacakes and sit back watching that new fangled invention that the Americans like (the TV) and be swept away to the Sleeping Murder.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

4:50 From Paddington

A woman is being strangled and there is a witness. The police are can not find any evidence. So it is up to Miss Marple with help from Lucy Eyelesbarrow an independent maid.

The story does not totally follow the book yet it has the unmistakable Aunt Jane feel.

Notice how Aunt Jane is always several steps ahead of the others in planning. Watch the expressions when Aunt Jane grates on David Horovitch as Detective Inspector Slack. ""...When one of us is clever enough to find the body.""

I have seen this movie several times but I never noticed the train scene music until I watched ""Brief Encounter - Criterion Collection"" (1945) Rachmaninoff's Second Piano Concerto. Listen to the type of music during the scene where the two trains pass.

John Hallam has fun playing randy Cedric Crackenthorpe watch him again playing ""Lord Rhysart"" in ""A Morbid Taste for Bones"" (1997)",1508284800,6,1668,4.953405017921147

8165651,4,B000M1RCJY,"""Sleeping Murder and ""4:50 from Paddington"" were both part of PBS' popular ""Mystery!"" series in the 1980s and featured Joan Hickson as Agatha Christie's spinster village sleuth Miss Jane Marple. Both films were produced in 1987 and each are about 1 hour and 45 minutes long. I appreciate Joan Hickson's portrayal more now than I did in the 1980s, because I have since seen Geraldine McEwan's (2004-2008) batty interpretation and Julia McKenzie's (2008-2013) bland, grandmotherly Miss Marple in the recent remakes for ""Masterpiece Mystery"". Though Hickson was a little too old for the role, her Miss Marple had more personality and comes across as sharp. She embodies that quality that Agatha Christie cited in her own aunt: she always expects the worst of everyone. She can be irritating and condescending. She is confident in her superior intellect. A detective must be out of the ordinary in some way to keep us interested, and Joan Hickson's Miss Marple is.

These adaptations of Christie's novels adhere more closely to the original plots than the remakes. Though Christie's plots can stretch credulity, they are not anachronistic, as the remakes were, making these true period pieces set in the 1950s. ""Sleeping Murder"" involves a cold case, and the villain is unfortunately obvious from the start, leading the audience to think the characters a bit slow in figuring things out. The performance by the guilty party is overplayed, which I blame on director John Davies. Had he been more subtle, this mystery would be more enjoyable. It does feature one of Agatha Christie's most attractive young couples, however, as they are portrayed onscreen, Gwenda and Giles Reed. ""4:50 from Paddington"" is perhaps a little better. Joan Hickson is very good in both, and I did not get the feeling that she had been pushed into too many scenes because she is the ""star"", as is often the case in the remakes. The writers are confident enough to let others speak.

The films are:

""Sleeping Murder"" begins as Giles Reed (John Moulder-Brown) has returned to England from New Zealand with his new wife Gwenda (Geraldine Alexander). Driving on a country road, Gwenda spots a large, old house for sale and falls in love with the property. The couple buys the home, and Gwenda tries to ignore the strong feeling that someone died in the house, at the bottom of the stairs. A series of incidents, in which Gwenda discovers that she knows something about the house's past that she shouldn't leaves her unnerved. Gwenda and Giles visit his friend Raymond West (David McAlister) in the city, where they meet West's aunt Miss Marple. The group go to the theater in the evening, where one scene causes Gwenda to scream in terror. Gwenda fears she is going mad, but Miss Marple assures her that there is a more likely explanation: She has been in the house before, and the murder she recalls may be real. But, she warns, it may be best to ""let sleeping murders lie.""

Elspeth McGillicuddy (Mona Bruce) comes by train from Scotland to visit Miss Marple in the village of St. Mary Mead in ""4:50 from Paddington."" As her train passes another train on a parallel track at night, Miss McGillicuddy witnesses a man in the other train strangle a woman. Shaken, she recounts the incident to Miss Marple when she arrives. Miss Marple takes Miss McGillicuddy to the local constabulary to speak to Detective Inspector Slack (David Horovitz), who reluctantly dispatches officers to search the train and the track for a body. When this produces nothing, Slack expresses his annoyance to Miss Marple and considers the case closed. But Miss Marple discovers that there is a stretch of track, as it runs through the estate of the Crackenthorpe family, where a body could have fallen down the embankment and out of sight. She enlists the help of her friend Lucy Eyelesbarrow (Jill Meager) to take employment as a housekeeper there, so she can search for clues.",1425427200,,3920,4.899096385542169

8165653,3,B000M1RCJY,"5 stars to the seller for excellent packaging, good price, and quick delivery. As a collector of Agatha Christie Miss Marple DVD films, I rate this offering 3 stars only because of the editing (cutting out scenes) of what I consider the best of Christie's Miss Marple. A&E and Masterpiece Theater apparently place time and public affairs announcements before excellence and reverence for an otherwise great DVD. Joan Hickson is my personal choice for the best of actresses in the Miss Marple role. I must acknowledge that of some 14 DVDs of ""4:50 From Paddington""  in my collection, I have only one that is complete, a copy of the master tape of the episodes with no cuts. So, all things considered, this DVD can be recommended for what is there. Enjoy it, realizing that it' close to a ""reader's digest"" version.",1386720000,3,813,4.76595744680851
8165654,5,B000M1RCJY,"As SLEEPING MURDER begins you may recoil from the ""beautiful couple"" and their precious lifestyle.  If you react that way on meeting their upper middle class clothes and voices --- calm down, sit back, and watch a frightening murder mystery happen to a rather unexceptional couple.
What a cast --- this series has managed to recruit superb character actors in all roles, and they stand out all the better because the two main protagonists are played so gently.  Joan Hickson can deliver a quiet little old-lady line that knocks you off your feet a second later. John Bennet is so impressive and sad. Frederick Treves --- well, in case you don't know the story, I'll say no more, but he is so good. Some quality in all the Joan Hickson Marple series allows you to watch them again and again and again, with no diminution of pleasure or surprise. Any later versions will inhabit a different world.",1312070400,2,895,4.694267515923567
8165655,5,B000M1RCJY,"Here Agatha Christie nearly becomes gothic. A young couple comes back to England and buys a house on a fancy from the wife. And it so happens it is the house where she lived when very young before being sent to New Zealand where she spent her whole life. But it is also the house where her stepmother was assassinated just before she left. She is having strange recollections that are rather disturbing. So she decides to find out about her past in spite of the advice given to her by several people, including Miss Marple that the past should not be meddled with. And sure enough that will cost one more life and the capture of a criminal (once again at the vost of some staging). This story is special because these old Tudor houses are known to be built on strange layouts due to the practice in the past to have secret corridors and secret hiding places for religious difficult times that lasted up to the end of the 18th century, if not even later. But no matter how hard Agatha Christie hints at such a possibility in this Hillside house she manages to keep us away from the secret passage to some all the more secret dungeon with or without skeletons. But a body there is for sure, even if we do not see it.

8165656,3,B000M1RCJY,"Agatha Christie's busy body detective is missed in the acting
here. I liked the mysteries:4:50 from Paddington best.
The Sleeping Murder seems more of a spiritualist plot than the mystery
that we can enjoy. The fellow who does the murders is someone unsuspected
as usual in the strangled and thrown from the train mystery, but I liked
the suspense anyway. I've seen the Miss Marple role done right
where she has this old lady irritation mode working.
The inspector is called ""Slack"" for a reason and his failure to find
the body, here, is very funny if done right.",1247875200,,564,4.707070707070707
