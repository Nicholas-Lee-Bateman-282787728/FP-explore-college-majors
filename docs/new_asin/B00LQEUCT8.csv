6499942,5,B00LQEUCT8,"Franky on the cover is awesome, I love one piece and am happy to pick up the collections along with the voyages. This series is so much better in funimations hands, they did amazing work with the voice acting and have kept true to the original jap. Also I LOVE the marathon feature, more anime should have this feature I love the open and end theme but as more and more anime add scenes at the end of the end themes it's nice to skip the theme and go right into the plot footage.",1411603200,8,479,4.1063829787234045

6499951,5,B00LQEUCT8,Really dramatic this collection and I did enjoy it. So far the water 7 ark or saga is the most intense or dramatic saga one piece has given us. That's my opinion at least.,1444521600,,171,4.0588235294117645
6499952,4,B00LQEUCT8,"These DVD's always drop in price soon after release, which is a great thing. Otherwise, I may not feel they're worth it, but now I get over 20 episodes of one piece for a good price, which really works well with the super-long story arcs of One Piece. The anime, when compared to the manga, definitely is flawed, though. Due to being such a big project, it doesn't have the animation budget it needs, and you can definitely notice that. It may not be for this season particularly, but there's often so much filler that it can take up half a season, which makes it feel like a waste to me. The voice acting on the part of FUNimation is well done though, they rarely disappoint.",1443830400,,676,4.373015873015873

6499957,3,B00LQEUCT8,I don't really know what to make of this volume and this series. In this volume I like the half of what was  in here and that was the court of owls part and the 0 issue. The rest of the volume just wasn't uninteresting personal life stuff and a forgettable villian.,1439769600,,265,4.096153846153846

6499989,5,B00LQEUCT8,"This collection contains Voyages 3 & 4 from season 4 & they're packed with so much set up for what's coming & are just a marvel to watch. Also, it's the intro to Franky & some of Robin's backstory. These episodes are leading to what's coming in the Enies Lobby arc & it's a set that's WAY more worth the money than the Voyages in my opinion. I HIGHLY recommend it to all English-speaking One Piece fans.",1413763200,5,403,4.246753246753247
