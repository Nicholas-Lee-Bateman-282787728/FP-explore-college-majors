5047563,5,B0071LEKJS,"I'm a big fan of the manga and the anime. I have the two S.A.V.E editions for the regular series, and was happy to see the same for the OAV's. I especially like that I can turn the insert inside out, and it no longer has that bright green edge (looks better on my shelf, lol). If you're a fan, of the series, you're probably going to want these, as they pick up after the series ends, and tells another pair of adventures. I hope this is helpful without being a spoiler.

Quality wise, it's the same as the other S.A.V.E. editions, which I've personally never had an issue with.",1357084800,,578,4.254545454545455
5047564,5,B0071LEKJS,I'm gonna make this simple. Excellent! I love the tsubasa series and these movies were awesome. Word filler word filler word filler word filler.,1356566400,,144,5.041666666666667
5047565,4,B0071LEKJS,"After traveling through many worlds, Fai is dealt a nearly fatal blow. Kurogane goes to great lengths to save him. They find themselves in a wasteland where acid rain ruins everything. A strange evil is lurking in the shadows there. Shaoran must find a way to save Sakura and his friends. The task won't be easy. A new enemy has appeared. Shaoran is facing another version of himself. One of them is a clone and one of them is the original. Shaoran's fate may be sealed, and with his death, Sakura is also doomed.

This is a pretty good OVA. I'm disappointed that they haven't taken the anime further. I believe the manga continues on, but I can't really get into that stuff. I recommend this OVA to any fan of the series. While this has a different vibe than the previous anime releases, it is still quite good.",1355097600,2,812,4.449664429530201
5047566,4,B0071LEKJS,"I'm glad they pulled the show back toward the manga, but trying to fit all of that information into five OVAs is a bit much. They still left it on a cliffhanger, and they left out huge important parts. I wish they'd showed more of Fai's story, and not left out the entire Celes fight. Other than that, I loved it. The artwork was just as good as in the show, and I'm really glad all the voices are the same. I can't really complain about it. It's beautifully written and arranged. Tsubasa is by far my favorite anime, and this OVA collection stays true to the story.",1355097600,4,566,4.25
5047567,5,B0071LEKJS,"To start, I recently bought this along with season two thinking the OVA continues the two seasons already out.  It doesn't.  The OVAs animate some of the events of the manga, but it doesn't continue the events of season two... in fact, it overwrites them.  The OVAs aren't for people who've been following the anime... they're for anyone familiar with the Tsubasa's story.  (Preferably ALL of Tsuabasa's story... otherwise you'll probably just be confused, because this is right where the story takes a turn for the weird)

It's also important to note the two OVAs are disconnected.  Tokyo Revelations doesn't end at the beginning of Spring Thunder, and the events not shown between the two ovas are important.  Its not that the material just wasn't included... it was never animated to begin with.

The OVA collection looks and sounds fantastic, and to be honest, it sells itself pretty well just on it's action, animation and soundtrack alone. If you are following the story, it's best to keep in mind it's more like an animated ""greatest hits"" from the late manga than a proper continuation of Season 2 of the anime.",1345075200,13,1119,4.852631578947369
5047568,5,B0071LEKJS,"I'd read about half of the Tsubasa manga when I started the anime. I was enjoying the manga, seeing all the crossover characters and visiting so many new worlds. I really looked forward to seeing it come alive on the screen. Unfortunately, I found the anime was horribly boring and the whole second season was filler. But when I head that possibly my favorite part of the manga had it's own OVA, I knew I had to give it one more try. I am glad that I did!

This OVA covers the part of the storyline where things actually happen. Some questions are answered and even more are raised (Syaoran will surprise you!). It doesn't end well, since it leaves you with a bunch of unanswered questions, but if you read the manga this isn't a problem. If you aren't interested in reading 28+ volumes of manga, well... you probably should't torture yourself by watching this OVA. The Tokyo Revelations OVA was my favorite of the two and it alone is worth buying the set for. $18 bucks for 5 episodes might seem a little pricy, but if you think of it more as a movie, it isn't all that bad. Also, at this time, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/original-OVA-set/dp/B00477VLXW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">original OVA set</a>&nbsp;and SAVE OVA set are both the same price. I prefer the other set, since 1) it is available now and 2) it doesn't have the ugly green spine.",1328832000,3,1398,4.849372384937238

5047581,1,B0071LEKJS,"Most of the reviews here have been highly favorable.  But then, most of the reviews were written by fans of the manga who disliked the divergences between the manga & the TV series.  Fair enough.

But as someone who is only familiar with ""Tsubasa"" from the TV series, I found these OVAs extremely unsatisfying.  So much so that they kinda retroactively make the rest of the series a waste of time.

On the plus side, the production values are great in terms of sound, voice acting, & animation quality.  And at least these 2 OVAs further the plot and fill in the backstory.  (Boy, do they ever!)

However, they don't conclude the story and everything seems to end on a massive cliffhanger that sounds like it's never going to be resolved (on screen anyway).  After the bombshells revealed here, I'm not sure I care what the resolution is anyway.  Without going into too many spoilers, I'll just say it involves clones and it's all very confusing.  And given what we learn here about what Fei Wang's plan is supposed to be, many of his other actions don't make sense.  And it also seems like the Dimensional Witch has been playing into Fei Wang's hand the entire time, even though they still seem to be enemies.

In addition to the frustrating, confusing plot developments, the tone is also much darker, bloodier, & more violent than the TV series.  As someone who enjoyed the serious but fun high adventure tone of TV series, that bothers me most of all.",1432252800,,1454,4.607003891050583

5047603,5,B0071LEKJS,Tsubasa: OVA Collection (Tokyo Revelations / Spring Thunder) [Blu-ray] was worth watching because it's like a season 3 but shorter. I hope they make more seasons cause the story is not done yet as of yet with this OVA Collection.,1380412800,,229,4.75

Id say a show worth watching and Owning.

Overall Rating 3.5/5
A strong group of characters travel between many dimensions to gather the feathers of Sakuras memories.  This OVA has two parts that have time gaps between each other and season 2 of the TV series.

Rumiko Takahashi kind of did this with InuYasha and Ranma  .  This OVA picks up later in the manga than season 2 ended and kind of links into the TV shows with a couple flashbacks.  Its odd but I found it to work well enough to be a recommended buy and continuation.

Theme Songs 4/5
This series continues to have solid music, good opening and ending.  Mostly fast paced, I didn't skip them.

Ending 3.5/5
NO spoilers, the ending is imperfect but better than the 2nd season of the TV series.",1469491200,,783,4.457746478873239
