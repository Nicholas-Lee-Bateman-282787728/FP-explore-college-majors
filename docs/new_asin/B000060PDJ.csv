1684110,5,B000060PDJ,This product was exactly what I expected... I would definately order from them again!,1155340800,,85,5.142857142857143
1684111,5,B000060PDJ,"When I first saw this dvd, it was a first to me. I had never seen something so cool as this animated art filled dj-ing music experience. Dj-Qbert did a great job. I love how someone could think something like this and bring it into motion. I had to get me a copy of this dvd. I love animation, djs, and the hip-hop scene. This is one of the illest dvd's I have seen. Great entertainment for you and friends with the same taste.",1144108800,,427,4.095238095238095
1684112,5,B000060PDJ,yeah. it's true. this movie is awesome. i think i watched it four times in the first week i had it.,1141344000,,99,3.761904761904762
1684113,5,B000060PDJ,"This animated movie is so good, I've been watching it every single day (sometimes more than once a day) since I got it. Any one who digs turntables, hip hop, or cool animation needs to check this out.",1141344000,,200,4.2894736842105265
1684114,5,B000060PDJ,"i have yet to hear the soundtrack that accompanies this tripped out film. i watched it with the sound off at a local club. it stands alone as a sensory trip. the images are intense and the colors are great. the characters are eerie and humorous all at the same time. if you want something odd and a little disturbing, but totally thought provoking... get this dvd. i am a fan of q bert's. i did not even know this was his project. he is the godfather of battle scratching. he has great style and he is a pioneer in the art of the dj. get it for the collection and get it for the heads who love visual art. cmon amazon send me this thing so i can hear it too.",1138320000,,658,3.992424242424242
1684115,5,B000060PDJ,"I mean, DJ QBert is basically pioneering a completely new way of expressing  his art. He's syncing his music to cartoons. I've never seen anything like it. The story lines are great, and the way he portrays the essences of hip hop culture is so unique.

Grab this DVD, roll a blunt, and be amazed.",1128470400,,297,4.381818181818182
1684116,3,B000060PDJ,"This Dvd is absolutely messed up and tripped out. It has its ups and downs however. The animation is really well done and everything, and goes perfect with the soundtrack. However, at many parts its just way to chaotic and gets really annoying wheras other parts look trippy and the music sounds good. For example the first part of the movie almost gave me a seizure because it was so chaotic . After listening to Demolishion Pumpin Squeeze musik i expected more from this dvd.",1110240000,,477,4.623529411764705
1684117,5,B000060PDJ,"From the collective minds of Doug Cunningham and DJ Qbert blasts forth this wicked delicacy. This is no second rate animated Hip-Hop afair, as 'Wave Twisters' was selected by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art to be included in its archive for digital moving images. I can view this little masterpiece repeatedly and never tire. A blind person could thoroughly enjoy this, as the audio sector of this film is spellbinding space-age turntablism and beats of the highest level. Each track from QBert's bad-ass 'Wave Twisters' album has been carefully illustrated, second-by-second, frame-by-frame. Not just illustrated, but in fact given a dynamite story involving an evil dentist, the red worm, and heros; culminating in a final showdown. It's about the ongoing battle between the dark, unelightened forces, and those trying to perpetuate the Lost Arts. This is a high quality capsule, that was unfortunately not given nearly the exposure it deserved. It is not a stretch to put this film in the same category as 'Heavy Metal', or 'Yellow Submarine'. 'Wave Twisters' is akin to those two films (but containing a wicked Turntablist/ Space-Age Hip-Hop soundtrack). If you are at all into Hip-Hop or QBert, then this is an essential purchase. Even if you are not, the dazzeling animation and clever storyline make it a worthwhile purchase as well. Fight the Power!",1109894400,7,1364,5.121076233183857
1684118,5,B000060PDJ,"On the Strength: Visualization of DJ QBert's kinetic debut album is without a doubt, the hottest Hip-Hop film to date, and certainly a one of a kind. With vinyl as his canvas, and two turntables as brushes, QBert has managed to paint a timeless masterpiece that is sure to enthrall b-boy enthusiast for decades to come. He is undoubtedly the Picasso of modern-day turntablism. Illustrator Doug Cunningham's characters are by far the illest bunch of deranged outcasts ever assembled on screen. When Lord Ook (a cross between your mom's old rag-doll, and Pinhead from Hellraiser) learns that the Wave Twister has resurfaced, he calls upon his number [guy], the Redworm (a baby donned in a Mexican wrestlers mask, with a red parasite protruding from his naval) to retrieve it. The Redworm unleashes his psycho army of ""Chinhead"" motorcycle thugs, (I ain't even gonna' try to explain) on the Dental Commander's mother ship (a city sized '63 Impala). The Dental Commander retaliates by releasing his own army (a band of custom lowrider fighter ships, ammoed with spray-paint cans as rockets) for a high flying, psychedelic, inner-galactic dogfight. Wave Twisters will shuttle you to the edge of sci-fi adventure, and hold you there, dangling atop a root canal of musical and cinematic brilliance.",1048809600,3,1291,5.123222748815166
1684119,5,B000060PDJ,"hey folks, i never thought i'd be one of those guys who shills for some movie or video on amazon but hey, i was wrong... ok, dj q-bert has long been held in high esteem by many a wanna be turntablist extraordinaire. and now he's come through (not without a little help from his friends) with the visuals to match his turntables on acid sound. wave twisters deserves a worldwide release and a place in the pantheon of many a cinemaphile. play it at half speed and you've got the perfect companion for those nights when you can't keep your bowl glowing orange and your dayglo pink floyd posters aren't cutting it. hey who knows, you might even find yourself digging through vinyl stax next time you're at the record store...",1037750400,6,722,4.519083969465649
7957664,5,B000060PDJ,"Awesome flick, trippy and imaginative. Plus there are photoshop files on the disc from different scenes of the movie. Lots of fun to play around with. The movie looks good in a yellow box, too.",1443484800,,193,4.542857142857143
7957665,5,B000060PDJ,"I saw this while browsing through NetFlix and started to watch it out of curiosity because it looked sort of interesting. I thought I'd give it five minutes, then another five minutes and so on until I wound up watching the whole thing. I ain't a huge hip-hop fan, but I do like it. After finishing watching, I kept thinking about it, so I decided to watch it on my hi-def big screen with stereo surround (I had originally watched it on my mac book). It wasn't the same movie. Must be watched on big screen in stereo.",1411171200,,517,4.285714285714286
7957666,5,B000060PDJ,A great visual journey through scratching by DJ Qbert and his crew of intergalactic henchmen. Everybody I've watched it with was impressed.,1396828800,,139,5.363636363636363
7957667,2,B000060PDJ,I love this movie but the disc just stopped working. This is the second one I've purchased and they both just stopped working one day after three or four times watching.,1389312000,,169,4.483870967741935
7957668,5,B000060PDJ,"If you've never seen it, get it!!! If you like trippy, get it! If you love Art get it! There's only one of these, well actually, Beatles Submarine runs parallel... I won't lie, it's tough to watch, but it has a lot of great ideas for 3D artists!",1304985600,,245,4.125
7957669,5,B000060PDJ,"I had no idea what to expect. I saw a small little blip of recommendation somewhere & since i love anime & Hip Hop, i figured this might be a good x-mas present to myself. What a surprise! It is excellent for the year it was made.
The sound track & images of scratch DJ's preserve a lifestyle many of us experienced as we grew up. The animation might be considered a little rough or amatuerish - but this in fact contributes to the over-all vitality of the disc. If you have enjoyed the various animated music videos down thru the years & have an appreciation for Japanese anime, you will find this a worthwhile addition to your collection. It is quirky & fun!",1297296000,,660,4.330645161290323
7957670,4,B000060PDJ,"Really liked this, wish I hadn't lost it in a move.",1262649600,,51,3.727272727272727
7957671,3,B000060PDJ,"the visual art is very intense and entertaining and the audio is amazing too
some how it links a story which i was amazed
i really thought this owuld be an actual movie though with just dj qbert playing music in the back ground
some kind of trippy entertainment but its not everything is played ouot thru the music which isn't bad

i just wouldnt bust this dvd out again unless i was having a party or friends over and wanted to put some visual sound on the big screen not something you would really sit down for unless you were tripping out.... good stoner movie",1236816000,,563,4.311320754716981
7957672,5,B000060PDJ,I love this video! We had a copy that stopped working and took forever to find a replacement. So glad I finally did! Great music put together with images(similar to the Gorillaz animation). Not for young children though!,1209600000,2,220,4.815789473684211
7957673,5,B000060PDJ,The best visual experience available...and the sound may still be the best part.  I've watched this over 20 times and still find elements new to me.  I have bought this as gifts and have recommended it to very many who want a high end visual show.,1169078400,,247,4.3478260869565215
