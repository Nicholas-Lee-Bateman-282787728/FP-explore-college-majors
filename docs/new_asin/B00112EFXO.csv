3058455,4,B00112EFXO,"This was a very helpful book.  Had the pictures been in color, I think I would have given it 5 stars.  The CD was helpful also.

All in all except for only black and white pictures, and having to have a computer handy for a lot of things, it was a good book.

Also the price was a bit steep for what I got.",1212364800,,306,3.734375
3058456,4,B00112EFXO,"Tenia mis dudas al pricipio antes de comrarlo, pero el video es extremadamente didctico
Te explica, aunque en breve cada funcin de la cmara, con ejemplos  de las distintas situaciones en el momento de hacer una foto.
Te ayuda a aprender a tu ritmo.
y te da tips que no vienen en el manual
realmente vale la pena.
solo un pequeo detalle, en algunos capitulos se queda un tanto corto, pero creo que te da la base para seguir experimentando por tus propios medios.
El video cumple su objetivo: SACAR EL MAYOR PROVECHO DE TU CAMARA.",1212364800,5,528,4.5
3058457,5,B00112EFXO,"This book is so much better then the manual that comes with the 40D, as a result I hardley ever use the Canon manual.",1210464000,,117,3.9166666666666665
3058458,2,B00112EFXO,"Well, let me first say that the item arrived fairly quickly (2 weeks to Australia) and arrived in pristine condition. The DVD cover itself looks well presented. The DVD looks like it was mass printed with only the name of the disk on it. From there it really went downhill. I'm new to DSLR photography and have had my 40D for 3 months. However, I'm not a noob to photography principals and really wanted a hands on 40D specific walkthrough. The presentation and the graphics and audio is all top quality and that was fine. The presenter looked a bit like a robot and sounded a lot like Troy McClure which was VERY annoying. The presentation is much more an intro photography rather than the 40D, they only just touch on the simple and rather obvious features of the 40D. There's no real in depth tutorials on how to employ the 40D in different environments or situations. Like I said they talk a lot about the important issues of very basic photography but I didn't learn anything novel that I didn't pick from the manual and after a week or two of mucking with my 40D or searching for 40D on YouTube. For this reason I was VERY disappointed and feel a bit ripped off. This would be more suited  for someone who has never picked up a digital camera and happens to be learning on a 40D.",1209686400,16,1285,4.399159663865547
3058459,5,B00112EFXO,"I recently bought the Canon 40D after spending several years with a Sony Cyber shot 5MP camera and missing shots due to shutter lag and blurry photos. My primary subjects are my Angora Goats and I use the photos for my website and our group's calendar. I have a pretty basic understanding of photographic principles.

I was a bit disappointed with the results of my first few sessions with the packaged zoom lens that came with the 40D. I decided to pop for the 70-200 L series lens and was wowed with some of the shots but quickly found out this combination didn't guarantee great photos everytime. So I figured some of the problem must be me. Turns out I was correct.

The video starts by giving you a framework or structure to get yourself and you camera prepared beofre the shot. The first camera specifc thing I learned was what the color coding on the back of the 40D buttons meant. I bought the camera from Camera/Video store with what seem to be knowledgeable sales guys but they didn't tell this. This video does a tremendous job of covering ALL of the features of the 40D with some ideas and actual photos demonstrating the features like low contrast, backlite subjects and many more topics and when you might want to use them. This is a lot easier to understand watching the than trying to read about it.

During this video I discovered several of the focusing issues I was having and how easy it will be to adjust how I use the excellent tools to realize the results I have invested in. If you are a Pro and new to Canon or the 40D this video could be useful to in 90 minutes to get the soup to nuts information on the 40D. If DSLR is kind of new for you or you are coming from a point and shoot world this could be the perfect tool to in 90 minutes to open the 40D world for you. An earlier review wished he could have worked with the camera during the video. The video at the end of several sessions recoomends that you turn off the video and practice with the camera and there is always the pause button on the DVD.

As it turns out the 40D has lots of customzation capability and options and this video introduces them and gives you enough of an idea of how you can make your 40D truely yours. The 180 minutes (watched it twice) I spent watching this will more than be made up for by getting it right in the camera and spending a lot less time trying to save photos on the computer and I am betting I will see a lot more of the stunning shots from that 70-200mm F2.8 L series lens.

3058460,4,B00112EFXO,"The ads for this item and the back of the DVD case read:  ""All you need is this training DVD and about ninety minutes, and you'll have the knowledge and the confidence to create the images you want.""  This very considerably overstates the case.  You cannot learn what you need to know about the 40D in ninety days, much less ninety minutes.  I feel rushed when watching the DVD.  It doesn't give you time to manipulate your camera while watching the DVD. I know that I can turn it off and come back to it, but it would be helpful if I could manipulate my camera while watching the instructions.  Still, this is a very useful DVD for those trying to learn the 40D, and I recommend it.",1208908800,11,683,4.296875
3058461,5,B00112EFXO,"Nicely done video.  High quality, good topics, etc.  Shows you basic and more advanced functions of 40D.  Looking forward to buy more products from this publisher.",1202428800,11,163,5.1923076923076925

8239874,1,B00112EFXO,I like the content of this CD a lot. It is just the quality of the CD itself that is horrible. There are permanent fingerprints on the play side and it takes a bit to find a way to make it play.,1392854400,,194,3.642857142857143
8239875,4,B00112EFXO,"This educational video was easy to follow and gave good feeling with cameras many options.
Mastering the 40D got quite easy after looking at the video twice.
Highly recommended",1275696000,,176,5.103448275862069
8239876,5,B00112EFXO,"I am new to the 40D and used a previous DSLR with fewer buttons and thought the 40D would be a little difficult to use with all of the buttons and different settings.  After watching this video and practicing thorough out the video I was very happy with the results.  Although it gives some basic lessons in photography, the thing it told you specifically about the 40D made it easy for me to understand and use.  Highly recommended!!",1262908800,,434,4.538461538461538
8239877,5,B00112EFXO,"I found this DVD to be very valuable.  I've owned my Canon 40D for over a year, however, I've never taken the time to figure out the advanced controls.  With the help of this DVD, I've learned a lot in the past 3 weeks.  I found it difficult to read the camera owner's manual and it's very technical.  The DVD tells you what ever button does on the camera and it shows you how it works.  I will purchase additional Blue Crane videos in the future.",1249084800,2,447,4.151162790697675

8239879,2,B00112EFXO,"if you are new to dslr cameras this might help you understand how they work otherwise its useless, it has a basic demonstration content similar to previous 20D and 30D dvds.",1231545600,,173,4.612903225806452
8239880,5,B00112EFXO,Anyone that has this camera should buy this video.  It explains all of the functions of the camera in easy to understand terms while it shows you how to use it. I highly recommend this video if you are a visual learner.,1222732800,,219,4.214285714285714
8239881,5,B00112EFXO,"I had previously purchased another DVD for the Canon 40D and it hardly told you much at all, this DVD told you SO MUCH! I watched it several times and am still learning from it. Definetly the best DVD for the cameral out there, well worth the money!",1221523200,,249,4.208333333333333
8239882,4,B00112EFXO,These videos are very thourough on explaining the use and setting up of the cameras. much easier than trying to read a manual and follow them. this Video explains the settings and what they are for and under what curcumstances you will need them. very good.,1213833600,4,257,4.608695652173913
