7822520,5,6302153026,"The 1930's and 40's were among the best years for the WB animation.
As most animation fans know, WB sold television rights for their pre-1948 cartoon library (a total of 337 cartoon shorts) to Associated Artists in 1957. Turner released all of these (sans 11 political incorrect shorts) on five laserdisc volumes. No other LT television package was so thoroughly represented on a video format.
Volume 1 collects some of the best and quintessential titles from the vast library. This was also issued on VHS.
There's a great range of musical one shots from the 30's to character driven shorts of the 40's.
Tex Avery, Bob Clampett, Friz Freleng, and Chuck Jones have a side of their best cartoons from this era. My favorite side has always been Hooray For Hollywood.
Picture quality is a mixed bag, but overall very colorful and clean.
The good news is that most of the shorts on this volume have since been restored and released on DVD and Bluray
Here's what has yet to be restored:
Cinderella Meets Fella (1938)
Hamateur Night (1939)
Dangerous Dan McFoo (1939)
Cross Country Detours (1940)
The Crackpot Quail (1941)
Inki At The Circus (1947)
The Unruly Hare (1945)
Bugs Bunny Nips The Nips (1944) [No Surprise]
Little Orphan Airedale (1947)
Daffy Doodles (1946)
What's Cookin' Doc? (1944)

The bad news is that the list gets longer for each successive volume.",1498521600,,1358,4.853448275862069

I grew up watching these shows, and I'm 100% sure it was Looney Toons.
Look at the picture, from the top Lazerdisc sales of 1992. 5th from the bottom.",1473552000,,260,4.22

7822525,4,6302153026,"This laserdisc boxset of The Golden Age of Looney Tunes was once the best source for the classic cartoons before the Looney Tunes Golden Collection DVD boxsets were released. The laserdisc set wasn't remastered like the slicker DVD boxsets are -- the prints used were sometimes faded, and there are no extra features included. Instead, it contained 5 laserdiscs with over 8 hours of cartoons, with one disc side dedicated to directors such as Tex Avery, Bob Clampett, Friz Freleng and Chuck Jones. The sets were released by MGM/UA Home Video, and comprise the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons from 1933-1948, which Ted Turner owned the rights to at the time. (This meant that none of the more familiar classic LT's from the 50's like What's Opera Doc? or Duck Dodgers were included. They were released separately on laserdiscs by Warner Home Video.) The artwork on the box covers and insets were far more appealing than the garish artwork presented on the DVD versions.

A handful of the cartoons on the laserdisc boxsets still aren't available on DVD as of this writing, such as the cartoons starring an aborigine called Inki, who hunts a Minah bird in several outings. **Also, on the first volume the very politically incorrect wartime cartoon Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips was included!** The set was recalled after Turner received an irate consumer complaint about the cartoon, and it was replaced with Racketeer Rabbit instead. If you are going to buy a used copy of this set, be sure to find out if it contains the offending cartoon or the replacement. (The only way to know for sure is if the seller has viewed the item. The listing on the box still has Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips even on the replacement sets.)",1243382400,14,1720,4.771812080536913
