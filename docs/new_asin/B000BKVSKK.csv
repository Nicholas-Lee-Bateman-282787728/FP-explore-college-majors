2423436,4,B000BKVSKK,"First, before anybody gets offended, remember when watching this show you have to suspend disbelief. It's so full of it and over the top it's hilarious. At times it can be a little brief, a few episodes are just a couple of skits and some boring filler, but for the most part there was at least one or two really good laughs per episode and at this price, that's pretty darn good.

The short description of the series is a guy's fantasy land where the hosts get to do pranks and tell jokes while chugging drinks. There is also their ""Juggy Dance Squad"" of attractive women who put on a show between commercials and sometimes appear in segments.  It's just a genuinely fun program. Seasons 1-4 were just lighthearted fun; season 5 tanked.

If you ever thought&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Benny-Hill/dp/B000T28PGA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Benny Hill</a>&nbsp;was funny, then I'd highly recommend this set. Even my wife liked the show and she barely likes anything I watch!

And yes, you do get all the final credits with women jumping on trampolines.  You sicko.  Ha ha ha.",1277683200,3,1120,5.194444444444445

8088500,5,B000BKVSKK,Arrived before estimated time. Still very funny after all these years for their skits and the beautiful Juggies women. Recommend you get all The Man Show series from 1-4 with Jimmy Kimmel & Adam Carolla . Season 5-6 With Joe Roegen & the other guy not so funny it has its moments and they got rid some the beautiful juggies girls hoping to spice the show up in there absence.,1405123200,,375,4.371428571428571
