8331027,3,B001OORMHA,"I did not like the East coast footage. Endless shots of Alligators prowling for breakfast. No thanks, although no one was shown being devoured. I did not like the West coast shots. I think of buying a DVD like this to take me into Nature, not give me more exposure to people. Yet, the West coast shots spend considerable time on a group of people doing Ti Chi in San Fransisco. This may be a perfect match for some, but all I was looking for was tranquil film of Nature's beauty without the intrusion of the human race, and certainly not the tension of who is seeking to make whom their meal. I won't be watching it a second time.",1262476800,7,630,4.258333333333334
