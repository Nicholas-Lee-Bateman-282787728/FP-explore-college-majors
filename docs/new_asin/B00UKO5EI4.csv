7049754,4,B00UKO5EI4,"So glad this came out Region 1 on DVD. Subtitles are the same ones that are on cruchyroll, so everything's perfect subtitle-wise. I don't like the cover art of this at all. It looks more like fan-art and not as crisp as the original artwork. If one saw the outerbox at a store, they would think this is bootleg. :/

However, the DVD image quality is nice. When watched with HDMI, the quality looks excellent. The only downside is that there are basically no extras and the images that usually show up at the end of each episode was taken out. So there no ""see you next swim"" at the end of each episode. :(

EDIT: I've added a pic of the cover art. Besides the logo, the artwork looks 100% traced. It's not what the original artwork looks like at all. :/",1432339200,4,753,4.258741258741258
7049755,4,B00UKO5EI4,"The release of Free! Season 1 by crunchyroll does what it sets out to do. Get Free! out to home release. I think this release is just the subtitled episodes put on a disc form.(I never watched it on crunchyroll). The qulaity of the episodes are good and no mis-spellings or problems with the subtitles. This release has also no extras if your into that. It only has clean openings and endings as ""extras"" and thats about it.  All the episodes are subtitled with the option to turn them off. My only complaint would be that i wish they chose a different image or a better quality picture for the cover. Nagisa and Rei give major derp face and it is kind of distracting once you notice it. So if you want the guys from Free! to swim their way into your shelf then give it a go and buy.",1431475200,6,783,4.22
7049756,4,B00UKO5EI4,"Finally the 1st season of Free! is available on DVD for the United States and Canada (region 1). This is the first season: episodes 1-12 on 2 DVDs. Only Japanese audio with no english dub sorry but there are English subtitle options though where it can be easily turned on or off. The episodes are in 16:9 widescreen. The only extras is the clean option to view the opening and ending. The only reason I'm only giving 4 stars is because when my package was delivered, just barely moving my unopened package, I could easily hear loose parts inside. Opening it I discovered that the second DVD was loose inside the DVD case and was not properly inserted into the case which resulted in minor scratches on the 2nd DVD. I lucked out that the scratches were small and not deep so the DVD was in good working condition. I don't know what caused the loose DVD placement in my order, maybe it was an manufacturing mistake from the distributor or poor packaging protection. Other than that just excited to own a physical copy of the 1st season. If you haven't heard, Funimation will be handling the English dub for the 2nd season of Free! maybe they might get a chance to do the 1st season as well someday.",1430956800,13,1197,4.470319634703197

7049763,3,B00UKO5EI4,"THE SHOW GETS A 5/5 but the publishing is what made me rate it 3/5.

While I'm happy that I have a copy of Free! on home video, I find myself regretting this purchase the minute the disc loaded. I'm really disappointed that Crunchyroll didn't publish this anime on Blu-Ray because this animation really deserves it. So if you get a copy, EXPECT STANDARD DEFINITION DVD QUALITY!

Here's where I'm gonna get picky:

 The DVD comes in a cardboard sleeve with what looks to be a traced version of official artwork. I mean, you can see the product image on this page...it looks like a bootleg design. I legitimately thought this was a bootleg until I saw it on Crunchyroll's site. There are literally DOZENS of official artwork images that could have been used for the cover and I'm finding it hard to believe that Eastern Star (the packaging and design company) didn't obtain rights to use ONE of those images or receive some from Crunchyroll or Discotek.

 The top menu...leaves much to be desired. There's a stretched out image as the background with the 6 episode titles on the lower half, along with subtitle options. All on one menu. It's a bit hard at first to realize what words you're highlighting as the ""hover"" color is just a lighter blue color. I mean, it gets the job done, but it's another reason this makes it look bootlegged.

 The subtitles look awful. Yes, they're legible, but couldn't they have chosen a better-looking typeface? The subtitles are large and pixelated, and look blown-up. If it didn't look like a bootleg from the cover, then the subtitles sure seem to do the trick.

 The video quality itself is sub-par. It's most definitely not 1080p, as the image has a bit of a blur to it and not as crisp as the quality seen on Crunchyroll itself. And for some reason, the DVD picture has a blurry black border on the sides of the video, almost as if the video was not cropped correctly. (This appears on my PS4, PS3, iMac, and DVD player).

I left a photo with full screen screen-caps showing the differences between Crunchyroll's stream quality VS. DVD quality (both screen-capped from an iMac). There you can see the major differences.

So unless you feel like you need a physical copy of this series in your hands, do yourselves a favor and watch this series from Crunchyroll, provided that you're willing to pay the premium membership to get HD quality.",1435708800,32,2378,4.635714285714286

7049766,3,B00UKO5EI4,"I love this show, it has been one of my favorites since it premiered. The show is fun, comedic, and not over the top. Over all I would give the show itself 4.5 stars.

The quality of the imagery is good on this DVD set. I play it through a blu ray and the picture looks great. What gets me is the DVD menu, and the subtitles. The menu image looks stretched, similar to the complaints i've read about the the DVD case image itself, and looking at the menu takes away from the over all quality of this set. The biggest issue i've had so far has been with the subtitles. I don't mind subtitles. I can listen to a dub or read subs, it honestly make very little difference to me in what way I get my anime. The subtitles for this set are similar to those found on a Senti anime set (or Section 23 release). They are yellow type with black borders, which bugs me right away, not sure why they can use white or something cleaner looking, but whats the real kickers is the fact that when played on your standard HD tv the subs have to resize so much that they start to pixelate.....what?! This is the digital age, why can't you make decent quality looking subs? Seems to me Discotek cheaped out on this part big time.

The pixelated subs are wrecking this set for me, but outside that it's a great show. Try it on crunchyroll or hope funimation gets rights to season 1 along with their season 2 ^_^",1432944000,11,1390,4.182835820895522

8707235,4,B00UKO5EI4,"Japanese schoolboys who live for swimming. It's kind of different for anime worlds who are mostly mech robots and teens with large swords. There is a real bromance as these boys are drawn with muscles and graceful motion as competitive swimmers. None have girlfriends and they don't appear to have any challenging class work they worry about. They are dedicated to each other and the traumas of parental loss and childhood crisis are easily fixed with SWIMMING! I think the original audience for shows like this are Japanese girls who love extra cute boys with no rough corners. That's okay as this would also work here in the U.S. after school for both girls and boys.

If they introduced this after 3PM during the school year on Cartoon Network, it would be a hit. Get that terrible ""Teen Titans GO"" off the air for a half hour and swimming would be popular for the little ones again. Four stars for the DVD copy, no Blue Ray available.  Yes the stories are too similar so one star lost.",1500163200,,989,4.581920903954802

8707238,5,B00UKO5EI4,"Participating in a competitive team sport is not only about achieving your personal best, but about learning to work as a seamless unit with your teammates: as intimate a relationship as that with family, or with lovers. No wonder this series is as gay as you want it to be. Not that the boys of the Iwatobi High School Swim Club are ever shown to have a life outside of training, swimming competitions, and bonding with their teammates -- that IS their love life -- but that's all we need for a teen drama that takes male friendship and camaraderie very seriously, and rewards the viewer with endless shots of young, ripped male bodies in swimsuits. Subtle, no. Fun, yes.

Season one sets the game in motion: melancholy Haru and flame-haired shark boy Rin, formerly the best of friends, now can't bear to be near each other. Can easygoing Mako, optimistic Naga, and science-minded Rei straighten things out in time for the big regional competition? What do you think?",1482969600,2,968,4.727810650887574
