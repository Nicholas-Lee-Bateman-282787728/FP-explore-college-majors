7970019,5,B00006J02E,"This video depicting jellyfish of the deep ocean and the pelagic area is one of the few videos that features the deep ocean as the location for the video. Here, a submersible travels to the depths to view amazing creatures 600 meters or more below the surface. We view close ups of siphonophores, deepsea jellies, and bioluminescent flashers. The viewers may shudder when some scenes make one feel like they are inside the picture, oblivious to the pressure and journeying through the endless depths.
  Deeper down into the earth, the technology brings photographs of transluscent squids, tiny jellies, and storms of plankton! The deep ocean scenes erupt the price to $25.00, which is worth it.
  The pelagic scenes also show breathtaking images of enormous jellies carrying formidable tentacles. Since the video is expensive and not going to be around long, ocean fans should pick this up today!",1089072000,,896,5.074829931972789
