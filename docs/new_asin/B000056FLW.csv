7931919,5,B000056FLW,"This is a wonderful classic totally different than most filmed today. Why? Because you see a very rare quality of values and ideals our current society seems to have tossed in the trash. I'd recommend it to at least show kids or grandkids....they may laugh at the B&W, the lack of special effects but it might also teach them something that will last a lifetime!",1506729600,,362,4.584615384615384
7931920,5,B000056FLW,"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, 1939 film

A United States Senator has died and the Governor must appoint a replacement to get the approval of a dam in the state. [Water supplies, or power, are very important in western states.] Politicians have been buying up the lands near the proposed dam. [""Honest graft"" said George Washington Plunkett.] The film shows the back-room deals of the political bosses. But the Governor's children clamor for Jefferson Smith (showing the effects of the media on impressionable minds). Candidate selection by luck? The Governor explains his logic: a young fresh face will impress the voters [and the machine will do the job of getting him elected]. Smith is a fast learner, he knows how to flatter the powerful Senator Paine. Smith's father was murdered by a mining corporation (but they couldn't prove it). Arriving in Washington he is greeted by lovely young women (""groupies"", a hint of scandal). Smith visits the Federal monuments and buildings. Smith is so naive you know it is just an act. His pet idea is a ""Boy's Camp"" for city boys. The film shows how the media can play the news in its photographs of Senator Smith.

The Senate commences with a prayer for wisdom. [Have they ever prayed for honesty and common sense?] Smith punches out the newspaper men who offended him [but they were just doing their job, following orders]. These journalists tell Smith how they see things. Senator Price explains how the laws are made; even a lawyer can't understand them. Secretary Saunders explains how bills are made into laws. [This is a tutorial for the people who forgot their civics courses.] Smith's camp would be located by Willett Creek (where the dam would be built). Smith's speech is played for laughs, but the visitors cheer and clap for this well-meaning plan. Senator Paine's daughter Susan will divert Smith away from the Senate when the bill for the Willett Creek dam is introduced. [Could Smith be working for the interests of Big Coal who don't want competition from hydroelectric power?] A tipsy Clarissa Saunders explains how the trick was done. Could the Senate introduce a bill that benefits one rich man? [This film shows how political bosses control the politicians.]

Jim Taylor advises Senator Smith to do what is best for his state, where Taylor owns many businesses and newspapers. Senator Paine explains the need for ""compromise"", playing ball. The next day Senator Paine brings up the facts about Senator Smith: ownership of the Willett Creek lands! Expert witnesses testify as to the validity of Smith's signature. Shall government ""of the people, by the people, for the people"" perish from this earth? Clarissa Saunders returns to advise Jefferson Smith on how to fight his expulsion. Smith launches a filibuster to prevent this, and creates dramatic speeches. Senators protest by walking out, but a quorum call gets them back. Taylor orders the press to censor Smith's speech! [Can one wealthy individual still control the media in one state?] The other Senators agree to put down this upstart. One small weekly newspaper will print the truth, even when gangsters attack the newsboys. Will the people suffer from Taylor and his gang? Thousands of telegrams were sent against Smith; he collapsed from fatigue. But there is a surprise ending that ends happily.

Signing an option to buy land shows Smith is learning how government works. Building a dam would provide jobs and future hydroelectric power. It is a more sensible project than a reform school. This film swindles your emotions by presenting a one-sided and biased viewpoint.",1430956800,,3597,5.010033444816053
