8036048,2,B00049QP8I,THE BOOK FAILS IN SHOWING TECHNIQUE. IT IS AN OKAY MASSAGE BOOK BUT NOT GREAT WITH ACCUPRESSURE. THERE ARE BETTER BOOKS AVAILABLE,1359936000,,129,4.909090909090909
8036049,1,B00049QP8I,"As a professional, I had hoped to enjoy an informative instruction from another professional. However, that was not the case.
Its true that some of the self massage was interesting. Not enough to merrit buying this video.
I was so unhappy to see her working on a client- doing deep pressure mind you- face down, on the floor, with his head turned sideways...no pillow under his feet. This is so dangerous. He should be on a table with a face rest OR the very least with his head in his arms, looking at the floor. I see this head turned to the side on ads for massage and it is really faulty and not realistic. Its not good to work on a client like that because you can and will create a pinching of their nerve there. plus their alignment is wrong for any kind of work-
Ever been to the beach and got all stiff and pained in your neck and back by lying on your stomach- notice how you must shift your head from side to side constantly? Right. Now add deep pressure massage! hello!
I am seriously disaapointed in this video.",1277942400,6,1024,4.283505154639175
8036050,4,B00049QP8I,"I liked this DVD, it was a friendly introduction to the practice of acupressure. Michelle Cluck shows non-professionals how to perform acupressure to relieve stress and reduce migrane. As a long distance runner, I hold tension in my body that is not relieved with just a hot shower and leg stretches. This DVD taught me how to release tension in my shoulders and head and I had fun trying the acupressure points in my legs and feet. The DVD routine made me feel calm and at peace.",1252886400,6,480,4.528735632183908
