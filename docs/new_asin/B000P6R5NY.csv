8189319,5,B000P6R5NY,"I really like this documentary on Cleopatra.  The intrigue of the power struggle in the late Roman Republic is fascinating, and makes me thankful I don't live in that kind of environment.  I like how A & E Biography documentaries try to find some positive characteristic to focus on about a person at the end, even if the person's life had lots of tragedy and the person wasn't all-around admirable.  For Cleopatra, the documentary compliments her dedication to keeping her nation intact.  The documentary is narrated by Karen Allen, who played Indiana Jones's love interest Marion.  The maps, art, academic commentators, narration, reenactment shots, and music are balanced well.  There's a lot of complicated treachery, ulterior motives, and diplomacy in this story, and with a story this rich, I think Cleopatra was a natural choice for an epic movie of Hollywood's ""spectacle"" era (1963 with Elizabeth Taylor as Cleopatra).  Julius Caesar lost his life to assassination partly because of Rome's discomfort with her foreign culture, and Marc Antony's deep bond with her was a major contributor in his undoing, resulting in his rival Octavian becoming Caesar Augustus, the first emperor (made more famous by the Jesus nativity story).  The documentary presents her as a woman whose sometimes ruthless acts were motivated by the climate around her, including her younger brother's advisers who opposed her rule and the Hitler-like treachery of Rome, all of which fostered distrust and vengeance.  I like that it explains her without trying to overanalyze her or determine whether she was more good or more bad.  The narration is very well written and carefully connects her motives with the events of Rome, so that it feels like one story instead of two.  It also differentiates what she is ""said"" to have been with what is known.",1429142400,,1831,5.090301003344481
8189320,1,B000P6R5NY,One of the worst and most inaccurate biographies out there.  Not worth watching in any level.  Ages of the major players aren't always correct.  Events are mostly fictionalised.  Certainly not a biography to take as history.,1407801600,,224,5.138888888888889
8189321,5,B000P6R5NY,This is a very interesting and informative DVD about  a very unique  woman. Her story is so basic and  so powerful that it becomes obvious why she still fascinates us today.,1397088000,,173,4.516129032258065

8189324,2,B000P6R5NY,"While this DVD is a reasonable record of the life of Cleopatra, the ending is completely misleading.

The main authority for the life of Claeopatra is the Roman author Plutarch, writng more than a century later.  At the end of this chapter Plutarch is quite clear that the death of cleopatra by almost painless snakebite was only the gossip in Rome at the time and that he personally didn't believe the story.

There is no definite information about the end of Cleopatra but the snakebite story seems to have been concocted by the Octavian political party to compare the behaviour of the ""foreign queen"" to the ""honest"" Roman Mark Anthony who had thrown himself on his own sword and suffered a painful death.",1299369600,,708,4.739837398373984
