1036057,3,6305469849,"No discussion of the silliest-looking monsters in film history would be complete without mention of Beast from Haunted Cave (which was reportedly nicknamed Humphrass).  It's some kind of diaphanous, tentacled, spider-like thing that likes to wrap his victims up for later blood-sucking.  Its costume looks to consist predominantly of saran wrap.  There's nothing the least bit scary about it - and the same goes for the movie, which plods along for some 72 minutes.

You've got these three crooks with an elaborate robbery plan near a ski resort.  After making plans for a squeaky clean ski instructor to take them on a cross-country trip to his remote cabin, they set up an explosion in the local mine and then rob the bank while nobody's looking.  Their haul?  Six measly gold bars.  Six.  That's it.  Just six.  There's oodles of gold right there for the taking, but they figure they can only haul two bars apiece on their backs.  Things go according to plan - except the one guy took a girl with him to the mine and managed to get her killed by some strange monster.  Speaking of girls, the gruff leader's having woman problems of his own; his annoying girl is tired of the robbery business and wants to make nice with the ski instructor.  Needless to say, I was pulling for the monster to show up and clean house at some point, as he's actually the least annoying character to be found here.

You might suspect this was the work of Roger Corman - and you'd be right - sort of.  Beast from Haunted Cave was produced by Roger Corman and Gene Corman - yes, I know it's frightening, but Roger wasn't the only filmmaker in the Corman family.  Monte Hellman directed, and Alexander Laszlo supplied the music.  I think it's an average low-budget monster flick at best, but it's certainly better than many a Corman B-movie.",1135987200,5,1820,4.652037617554859

1036059,2,6305469849,"While fairly well acted for this type of flick, the pacing is awful for viewers who need regular doses of monster scenes throughout. In this case it's too little monster during the first three quarters and way too much monster at the end. The characters move around from place to place

talking endlessly about their lives while we barely even get a glimpse of the Beast. But during the last ten minutes we witness several attack scenes in a row - which left me wondering why we couldn't get more of these scenes peppered throughout instead of just saved until the end. Cool looking monster, but overall tedious viewing.",1122681600,4,620,4.6880733944954125
1036060,1,6305469849,"This film was a real dissapointment for me.  I bought it in a dual pack with another low budget horror 60's film and was just left with nothing.  I wasn't really sure exactly what kind of movie this was...an independent film made by some students?  Is it a crime/thriller film?  Is it a horror movie?  Horrible acting, pathetic script, uninventive special effects, and a monster that's in the movie for only about 10 minutes.  I appreciate low budget horror films (chainsaw massacre, night of the living dead, the season of the witch), but this one just doesn't cut it for me.",1101254400,4,576,4.653465346534653
1036061,4,6305469849,"This movie scared me good as a kid. I never knew the name of it until a few years ago, but I ALWAYS remembered that creepy monster in the cave! What's it about? Well, some crooks decide to rob a bank near a ski resort. They pull it off flawlessly, planting explosives in a nearby mine in order to draw authorities there instead of the crime-site. All is well, until a bizarre creature from that same mine begins tracking, stalking, and killing the crooks. This thing is UGLY! It's like a giant spidery, tentacled, faceless horror. It webs it's victims, using them as snacks for later. The terror in the eyes of the webbed-ones seems like a direct influence for those poor souls ensnared years later in all those mega-budget ALIEN flicks. Unlike most of the rubber-monster movies of the 50s / 60s, BFHC is actually well written, acted, and directed. Another example of doing a lot with next to no money. Check it out...",1085356800,13,918,4.569696969696969
1036062,4,6305469849,"Beast from Haunted Cave is one of the few Roger Corman-protege pictures that actually comes off better than some of Corman's own films (try watching Creature from the Haunted Sea some time). The plot, though derivative, holds your interest, and the performances are for the most part competent and believable. A few of the dialogue scenes are surprisingly fresh and natural compared to typical low-budget efforts of the time. But what really gives this movie its reputation are the creepy atmosphere and gruesome shocks effected by director Monte Hellman in several `set-piece' sequences (the tree in the forest bit and all the monster's-cave scenes). No explanation is given for the bizarre, surreal `beast' and none is needed; it's just there to give you nightmares. Watch this with the lights off for old-fashioned drive-in horror show effect.
Synapse's DVD, if not `loaded' is still a fine showcase for the film. The movie is presented in both anamorphic widescreen and full frame versions and features the ""extended"" version with additional scenes (shot by Hellman) that were added for TV airings. The print is in very nice shape with very good to excellent tonal values, sharpness, and shadow/highlight detail; and little evident wear or speckling. Extremely watchable and light-years from most of the other butchered versions available on tape and DVD. Extras are comprised of trailer, chapter stops, and liner notes only (a commentary by Hellman would've made this a five-star disc), but the set is well worth the money for fans of 50s/60s horror cheapies.",1005955200,42,1564,5.1857707509881426
1036063,4,6305469849,"I highly recommend this new release over the previous ""Killer Creature"" double feature version. The quality of the DVD is very good, they give you the option of watching in either widescreen or the old box format and the audio is very clean. This version also has some missing scenes that I have not seen before. I wish this company well and look forward to thier next release.

1036064,4,6305469849,"I know this is a low budget quickie, and, as such, would probably be regarded by 'experts' as not having much cinematic merit.  But I have to say that, speaking merely as an average cinemagoer, I liked it a lot.  I found the storyline to be good, the acting and direction to be more than adequate, and Chris Robinson's spider monster to be genuinely scary.  The film moves along at a good pace, and the climactic final ten minutes - in the cave - are very effective.  All in all, a cut above the usual horror 'B' movie output of the period.",971481600,29,540,4.264705882352941
1036113,5,6305469849,"In Beast From Haunted Cave there is actually only one hint as to why this creature existed. Mining in the region had unearth some prehistoric creation. This is the only hint as to how the creature came to be that I could tell. It was also the only mention as to industrialism expanding into nature and the consequences' that could result. This film managed not to be arrogantly preachy. It was just your basic drive-in monster movie. I love it when movies just play out the story with out spelling out the set up or true intent of the picture. This was one of the first classic stories that felt like it was meant purely for entertainment.

The story is a good simple one that just start, as if the story is already being told and we just peeked in during the crucial moments of these peoples lives. It was not over acted, well by 50s standards the melodrama was down played. The monster stays in the shadows except during crucial moments, so the fact that the creature looks cheap is excusable. It is a cool classic b-movie that I had never seen and I actually enjoyed it. Anyway despite my ignorance of the 50s mentality I still enjoyed the fact that this movie was pretty progressive in its subject matter when it came time to display loose morals and wild behavior of the characters.",1431216000,,1287,4.476595744680851
1036114,3,6305469849,"""Beast from Haunted Cave"" was just as I remembered it. It was 1959, when I was a mere seven years old, when I saw it at a local movie theater on a double bill with Roger C o r m a n ' s ""The Wasp Woman."" It was a fun experience just waiting for the beast to be shown on screen! Seeing it again all these years was not disappointing! I liked that. it was filmed in black and white, I liked the sight of this blood-sucking beast trapping its victims in ""Haunted Cave,"" liked the plot concerning a bunch of criminals committing a gold robbery and then, much to their surprise, having to fight for their lives when confronted with this beast unexpectedly in the dead of winter at a ski lodge. Directed by the esteemed M o n t e H e l l m a n, this horror film truly represents the period from which it came, the heydey of the low budget horror film. A pure delight for fans of that period.

1036118,2,6305469849,"The brainchild Of Gene Corman (Roger's brother), this black and white monster movie is occasionally amusing, but often painful to watch. The premise is that some robbers formulate an extremely elaborate (some would say pointless) plan to rob six measly gold bars from a bank located near a ski resort. The plan involves setting off a diversionary explosion in an old mine nearby to fool the police as to their true objective. In the process, romantic entanglements occur and a long-slumbering monster is awakened.

Since all the characters are snowbound in the lodge, they become the prime food source for the monster, which is a ghostly apparition with tentacles that spins webs around its victims, preserving them so they can satisfy its hunger pangs at a later date. There is a lot of stumbling around in the cave, lots of shots fired, lots of torch waving, and a spectacular amount of overacting, all accompanied by a classic soundtrack that features a wheezing organ.

""Beast From Haunted Cave"" is by no means the worst movie I have ever seen, but it has no real distinguishing features, either. The monster is completely preposterous, the storyline is predictable and needlessly complicated, and the acting is what you would expect from the genre. While it has a few amusing moments, it certainly holds no real scares, and is tedious and padded despite its diminutive 73 minute running length.

For fans of the Cormans and 1950's monster movies this is worth watching. Once.",1223596800,2,1480,4.959677419354839

1036122,4,6305469849,"This 'beast' from the haunted cave must be seen to be believed. What a hoaky monster. But it works perfectly with the plot and actors.

A gang goes up to the Dakotas for a robbery. The plan is to blow up a mine, then when attention is diverted, steal some gold bricks from the suppository. Only thing is, they plan to escape on skis with only a tourist instructor to guide them.

Well everything would have been fine, but the demolition man took a bar girl to the cave with him. She gets attacked and now the monster has singled out the gang to go after.

The Beast has long tentacles that he likes to grab people with and then he puts them in webs so he can devour them later. The monster himself is a shaggy looking ghost type man that screams like a chicken with its liver being ripped out.

Overall a pretty good flick to make out to on a rainy Saturday afternoon.",1164758400,8,868,4.210843373493976

7890081,2,6305469849,"In the snowy mountains of South Dakota lives Gil, a guy who make a living as a ski instructor and tour guide.  He's hired by a group of people for a typical cross-country trek through the wilderness, but what he doesn't know is that this is actually an escape plan.  These good folks are going to pull a heist then vanish quietly in the woods.  It might have been a good plan if not for one tiny problem: the diversion they cause by blowing up a nearby mine disturbs a vicious monster.  Trapped by bad weather in the middle of nowhere this band of crooks is monster food. This is Beast from Haunted Cave!

It's a good, if campy, setup for some monster mayhem.  I like the notion of villains and heroes alike having to face off against a monster.  The conflicts between the crooks and their guide are interesting.  There's the added tension of the big boss's girl falling for Gil.  This causes the ring leader to go ballistic, but he's no match for the athletic Gil.

The acting isn't great, but I've seen much worse.  It's good enough to keep the interactions alive and keep the movie from being a complete bore.  How could a monster movie be a bore?  By waiting until the end of the movie to get to the monster, that's how.

We get a quick monster attack early on to let us know it's around.  It stalks the cross-country group a little, but the tension from that is barely existent.  Even when one of the crooks goes hunting it to prove he's not crazy we barely see anything of  it.  Finally near the end it decides to attack and cause some problems for the people who would rather not be dinner.

The creature is spider-like.  For the most part we see huge spider legs reaching into the screen to grab people.  When we finally do see the creature in its entirety it doesn't really look like anything.  It actually looks so bad that it may kill you with laughter which, needless to say, spoils some of the frightening scenes.  This is too bad because the notion of keeping people webbed up in its cave so it can suck their insides out at its leisure is creepy, but it isn't played up enough to be much more than a side note.

What's up with Gil's sister Jill?  We spend a few minutes with her early on, and it looks like she's going to be part of the story.  Yet once the crooks' plans get into motion she drops out of the story like she had never existed.  Sorry, Gil, Jill is nil.

Another problem is an abrupt ending with no follow up.  They've developed the characters enough that some time with them to see how these events affect them, the one(s) that make it out alive that is, would be welcome. Instead we get a proverbial shove out the door.

Content:
Typical of these old B&W movies there is virtually nothing questionable in this aside from a monster trying to eat people.

DVD:
I got mine in a pack of 50 Drive-In Movie Classics.  The audio is distorted and takes some effort to make out.  There are some pops during the edits and some white noise.  The picture is so low quality I didn't realize I was looking at snow until I saw the skis. It's a little trashy with a couple of scenes that are far too dark.  There's a blotch in one corner for a while. It eventually grows and takes over the whole picture for a few frames like a film monster at which point the overall quality degrades and skips some for a while.  When it clears up it's OK for the rest of the movie.  There are no extras unless you count the stupid Mill Creek logo that pops up from time to time.

There are a bunch of other DVDs out there. Its hard to say for sure if any of them are better than the others. Synapse offers a Collectors Edition that advertises a widescreen presentation and some meager extras. So that one might be worth checking out. Several multi-movie packs including some Roger Corman focused sets include this one but don't appear to be any better than any other set. Elvira has given it her treatment if you like that sort of thing. The one big exception to all that is the Blu-ray double feature from Retromedia. It sounds like the transfer is improved over others though still not necessarily great, and it offers some extra.

FINAL THOUGHTS:
Don't spend a lot of time hunting for Beast from Haunted Cave, but if you happen across it without any expenditure of effort it's a mildly amusing old monster flick. Virtually any any edition out there is likely to be better than the Drive-In Classics version. Synapses edition looks promising but with no reviews of it I cant even guess if its worth the cost or not, but the Blu is the obvious winner here. Im giving it only 2*, but thats partially because of the terrible presentation quality. Retromedias Blu-ray and Synapses collectors edition seem to be the best options here. Other than those go as cheap as possible.",1497139200,,4774,4.375709421112372

I'm adding this review of a movie that I already reviewed. The other version was the blu-ray release in 2017.
I originally watched this one a few years previous but did not review it so I'm doing that now. The only differences between the two will be the quality of the picture and extra's so that's all I'm commenting on and briefly at that.

DVD: The picture is what you'd expect from a budget release of a movie in the public domain. It's not that great. The picture isn't terrible but it's not good either. It's pretty blurry but there aren't a lot of big imperfections. There are occasional lines and static but not a lot. The sound is decent enough.

EXTRA'S: There are none. You get 4 chapter stops and that's it.
