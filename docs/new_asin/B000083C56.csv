7978558,4,B000083C56,"A young boy named Nakahito, who is a mystic in training accidentally awakens an artificially created human named Kurumi. She is called a ""Steel Angel"" and is completely loyal to whomever awakens her. The army is after her to use her power as a weapon. They send other Steel Angels after her to bring her back, but the other Angels end up living with Nakahito and Kurumi instead. Lot's of silliness ensues. That's pretty much the plot in a nutshell.

This anime is a lot of fun. The characters are cool and the laughs keep on coming. There is an ongoing story line but for the most part the show is about Kurumi being bubbly and goofy while trying to have fun with Nakahito. The animation is pretty good for an older series, and most of the voice cast is ok. Kurumi's voice can get on your nerves sometimes though. My only major complaint is the episode length. The episodes are like 10 minutes long. There is a preview and a closing song after every episode, so prepare to wear your remote batteries down skipping them. After the main story, there is a time warp of 80 years or so. Nakahito is obviously dead and Kurumi is awakened once again by his granddaughter. Now Kurumi is in love with a prepubescent girl. It gets kinda creepy. All in all this series is pretty fun, but it's nothing to write home about.",1355011200,2,1310,4.435684647302905
7978559,5,B000083C56,"This DVD is perfect for those who want just a little more Kurumi in their collection.  There are four mini episodes that show some of each character's personality, and the mixed up love lines between them.",1190419200,2,205,4.694444444444445
7978560,4,B000083C56,"I really liked these four episodes, but I personally think Karinka got a little soft in these episodes. The first one is when Saki becomes a movie star. In the second one, Karinka get's a love letter (awwwwwww!), third one Karumi becomes a women (haha!), and the last one is when a whole group of angels wants to fight Karumi for a kiss from Nakahito! The last one is my personal favorite. Great DVD. I recommend it.",1116633600,2,416,4.415584415584416
7978561,5,B000083C56,"These last four episodes aren't deep, but they're a fun end to the series.  Every Steel Angel gets her own episode to shine, and the results are all funny and on the rare occasion a little touching (i.e. Karinka with Nakahito's older brother).  Unlike some OVAs that seem like too much (i.e. Hand Maid May), this DVD plays with the series without making a mockery of it or being silly.  I highly recommend it.",1095724800,,409,4.5
7978562,5,B000083C56,"Okay, Kurumi is THE best anime.  And Encore just makes it all better.  Lots of laughs, especially the first episode where Saki becomes a movie star.  And, if fans can believe it's possible, Kurumi redefines the meaning of stupidity once again for all our enjoyment.  I must say though it's funny because I believe the creators were making up for the nudity quota in the 1st 4 discs all in this one, the bathhouse scenes with Saki and Kurumi are pretty funny.  All in all wonderful and full of laughs, as they say, ""a must for all Kurumi fans!""  Plus there's a preview of Kurumi 2, I think it's the opening theme, and the part with Kurumi transforming is hilarious.  So please, buy Encore, you'll love it!!!",1048377600,7,706,4.511811023622047
7978563,5,B000083C56,"I personaly like this dvd quite a bit, as instead of like most anime's after the main problem is over this does not bring up another giant world indangering event. Rather it simply shows a few amusing events though it is full of humor and quite a bit of what was from the previus episode I like the fact that they don't drag out any Oh I am going to destroy the world villians and just have a few episodes about life.",1048377600,,417,4.097560975609756
