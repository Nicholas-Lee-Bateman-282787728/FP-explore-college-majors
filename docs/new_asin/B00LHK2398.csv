6487645,5,B00LHK2398,"""WO0oo! WO0oo!"" as----Mickey Rooney's character----Andy Hardy would say.
I pieced all of these together the hard/expensive way... adding them to the 7-DVD
set which cost $60[$10 a DVD].
YOU do the math! These 22-DVDs come in---{at this writing}---at $6.80, each!
If you haven't already dipped your toe into any of the 1; 3; 6; 7-DVD collections, I,
sincerely recommend you JUMP INTO this great deal... while there are ANY left!

Sincerely Yours,
A Carol Burnett Fan!

Look at the actors,you'll see that most of the actors,most of the songs,most of the skits, and most of the episodes,too,are missing...even from the ad.

I was hoping they would be presented in chronological order but this is not the case. I have other DVDs of the show and I now have a lot of duplicate episodes.

I sat there and dutifully watched with my parents as they howled, giggled, roared, and reminisced over the comedy skits.  I primarily enjoyed the guest artists performances and musical numbers.

This expensive, boxed set contains 5 different DVD collections, 3 of which contain episodes from the Carol Burnett Show, the 2 other claiming to be ""Bonus Discs"". I was shocked to discover 1 of the 3 DVD collections entitled, ""One More Time"" which features episodes of the show have been butchered and are not at all complete. The episodes are surprisingly short and almost all the great Finale numbers are missing. This is so sad and inexcusable for fans who think they are purchasing complete episodes of this much beloved show. Shame on TimeLife and Carol Burnett for cheating their fans. I will not be buying any more collections because they cannot be trusted to deliver complete episodes.",1452729600,221,744,4.96

6487732,4,B00LHK2398,"I think this 4 is a little high but a 3 would be too low - maybe 3 1/2 stars is right.

I bought this because I idiotically thought this was the ULTIMATE collection - as it's called. To me, that meant this was the entire series - all 11 seasons - in one big box.  It is not that. and that's what disappoints me.

There are 50 shows in this box set.  Considering that one season of television is generally 23-26 episodes, that means I bought roughly two seasons worth of shows.

They are not in any particular order, so you can't say to yourself, okay, the next box set should be...  Because they are all random episodes.  For that reason, I won't be buying any more Carol Burnett Show box sets because how do I know I'm not buying duplicates?

But the shows are indeed good.  I watched maybe 3 or 4 shows, mad that I had spent $150 for two season's worth of shows, and didn't start laughing until I saw the ""That's Hollywood 86"" skit in which Carol plays a takeoff of Esther Williams.  And then I couldn't stop laughing.

All of the shows are wonderful.  The quality of the DVDs is wonderful.  I can repeat the ""title"" endlessly so it plays more than once.  It comes with 20 hours of extras but I would have rather had 20 more hours of the show.

Overall, I'm not disappointed.  But I won't be trying to fill out the collection because I don't where the sets all stop and start, and I don't want to purchase duplicates.",1449187200,142,1419,4.219330855018588

Five stars because it is The Carol Burnett Show, minus four because of the jerk company and lets face it this product is incomplete and definitely NOT the ""ultimate"" collection.

6487780,5,B00LHK2398,"THE CAROL BURNETT SHOW/ULTIMATE COLLECTION: THE CAROL BURNETT SHOW spotlighted television's most versatile comedienne; she portrayed dozens of memorable characters including CHARO, GLORIA SWANSON and JOAN CRAWFORD take offs, plus brain-dead secretary MRS. WHIGGINS...as opposed to LUCY, who always played ""LUCY"". Whether busting out rubber faced slapstick, duetting with stars like JIM NABORS and JULIE ANDREWS, or wittily fielding questions from the studio audience, this former GARY MOORE SHOW standout could do no wrong. Flanked by the best bunch of ""second bananas"" in history, BURNETT's secret weapon was HARVEY KORMAN, who could play anything from Hollywood has-beens to fussy floorwalkers and German dictators...but couldn't keep a straight face around mischievously unpredictable ad-libber TIM CONWAY. Straight man/stud LYLE WAGGONER and the redoubtable VICKI LAWRENCE (whose crotchety southern matriarch MAMA earned a series spin-off) rounded out the dream cast. A beloved potpourri of glitzy BOB MACKIE wardrobes, elaborate film parodies and game guest stars, THE CAROL BURNETT SHOW was the last and arguably greatest of all TV variety programs.

6487813,5,B00LHK2398,"The Carol Burnett Show Ultimate Edition is a gift to fans of the classic comedy/variety series that ran on CBS from 1967 to 1979. The life span of other variety series of the 1970s seldom exceeded two seasons, and their total number had dwindled greatly from the heyday of variety shows in the 1950s. The small nucleus of her regular cast remained constant for several years, with none of the original crew departing until 1974. They included Harvey Korman, Lyle Waggoner, and Vicki Lawrence. Frequent guest Tim Conway became a regular from 1975 to 1979.

At the beginning of each show, Carol would answer questions from the studio audience. The format included comedy sketches that spoofed TV series, popular movies, or well-known celebrities. Recurring comic characterizations included the inept blonde office worker inMr. Tudball and Mrs. Wiggins; Ed and Eunice, featuring Carol and Harvey Korman as an unhappily married couple at odds with Eunices mother, played by Vicki Lawrence (this sketch was expanded to Mamas Family, which ran as a series on NBC); and As the Stomach Turns, a continuing soap opera satire. Guest stars included Betty White, Roddy McDowall, Maggie Smith, Bernadette Peters, Jim Nabors, and Steve Martin.

The 22-DVD set includes 50 uncut episodes, which include musical performances by The Pointer Sisters and The Jackson 5. There also are over 20 hours of bonus material (including two episodes of The Garry Moore Show and 2004 interviews with Harvey Korman and Tim Conway). Fans will be happy to learn that the most famous sketch the show ever did, the elaborate spoof of Gone With the Wind, is here.
