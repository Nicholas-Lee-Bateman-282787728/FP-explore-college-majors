2164177,5,B00063MCI4,I HAVE ALL THREE SEAONS NOW AND THEIR GREAT TOO WATCH!ITS SAD THOUGH THEY WENT TO ONLY THREE SEASONS AND LEFT YOU WONDERING WHAT HAPPENED ON THE LAST EPISODE TO CHALLENGER AND THE CREW IN SEASON 3. HOPEFULLY THE PRODUCERS WILL COME TO THEIR SENSES AND COME BACK WITH A SEASON?,1100649600,3,276,4.431372549019608
2164178,5,B00063MCI4,"Now I wake up at 5am Mon. to Fri. just to watch ""Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World"". Now how dedicated am I? lol I have season 1 and 2 on DVD. I'm waiting on season 3!! Now I know there won't be a season 4 which is very sad. I don't care how messed up the story line is.. it's just the greatest show. I'm picky in what I watch. But all the seasons are great I still watch the reruns. They picked a good cast. I recommend you buy the seasons online and not in stores. Trust me cost me $65.45 each.",1100217600,2,502,3.7904761904761903
2164179,4,B00063MCI4,"I'm a huge fan of The Lost World and have watched all the episodes many times. Season three went down hill after first losing Malone, then Veronica (due to some contract issues with the Austrailian Gov., not the actors themselves). The writers tried to keep the story going by having Malone appear in a cameo appearance as a ghost and Veronica coming back in the final few eppisodes. They tried to replace Veronica with a new character from the future named Finn, but it just wasn't the same show. I do hope if the show comes back the get Malone and Veronica back on the show. Other than that, I think this is one of the best TV series Ive ever seen.",1099094400,2,650,4.336065573770492
2164180,4,B00063MCI4,"Even though this is the end of the series, it was still a delightful year. The series ran from 1999-2002. It is a pity it did not continue since I believe they have more people watching it now than when it originally aired. The stories sometimes seem a little far fetched with aliens and a woman from the future, but it won't disappoint you. Fans of the first two seasons will definitely want to get this third season. Unfortunately two of the characters, Veronica and Ned, are not seen as much this season since the Australian government imposed higher taxes since they were not Australian actors. Lord John Roxton and Marguerite Krux mainly carry the show in this third season, but they are excellent and the rest of the support cast and guest stars are great. Once again the 22 episodes on 6 slender cased discs are well worth owning. Besides with the cliffhanger at the end of the second season who can wait. I pre-ordered mine here at Amazon again since they have it for the best price. I highly recommend the entire series for the whole family. I loaned my first two seasons to my mom that is in her seventies and my nephew that is twelve and they both loved it. This series has something that will appeal to all ages.",1098921600,18,1224,4.46875

2164188,2,B00063MCI4,"This review is for the DVD set not the show. I love the TV show !!!

GOOD POINTS
The quality of the DVD is good thus the 2 stars.

BAD POINTS
1) This is the made for VT version NOT the Pay-per-view version. It has nude and extra shot removed.
2) The price they want for this is a joke. If people are buying this at this price they could very easy make more and bring down the price.
3) There are NO extra things on this DVD at all. Nothing, Just the TV show. Not even CC.

Personal Note:
When they start asking for so much for a TV show they are only begging for people to make copies of it and sale it. I feel if they don't want to make the show available for sale they should loose their copyrights to it. After all the whole point of copy right laws are so people do not make money off of it, so the person that made it can make money off of it. Thus if your not going to even try to make money off of it then open it up to the free market.

They should have at least gave us the full version and not the cut for TV cut. That is just wrong.

Out of all the people that went into the making of this they could not even find one person to sit for an hour to do at least one commentary? WTF?",1385078400,6,1191,3.748
2164189,5,B00063MCI4,good series I enjoyed it and I look foward to viewing the rest of the dvd it was a real treasure,1381968000,,96,3.619047619047619
2164190,5,B00063MCI4,this was a great movie and I think it would make a great gift to give to some one and I would recommend it to some one,1375315200,,118,3.4074074074074074
2164191,4,B00063MCI4,"I really got into this series, but after watching 66 episodes they left you hanging with no 4th season and everyone in dire situations and going to get killed. I think this is totally not on, have never seen a series do that before, at least if they were not going to do a 4th season they should have tied it up with a good ending, i would NOT recommend  the lost world as its very frustrating to be left hanging with no solutions",1369008000,,430,4.119047619047619
2164192,5,B00063MCI4,"The third season really did feel like the closing toward the last couple of episodes because the story writing got a little over the top and ridiculous..so I actually don't really mind this being the final season of this great TV show. I thought that I was really going to mind before I got towards the end of this season though. With that said, I really wanted to see more of the third seasons late new character Finn! :-) Actress lara Cox as Finn was only in 7 episodes (look her up, as I will later, she's done other stuff in television and even some movies). Of course on the end of the third season, there has to be a crazy (really must see what happens next!) cliffhanger but what can you do? All in all, a terrific third and final season that I really enjoyed all the way through, just the same as the first two seasons. I really like this companies art design and actor, producer & directer bios that rest on the left side of the inside of each dvd case. Really nicely put together! There's never any extras on these season packs, which would have been nice but it's no big thing.",1368316800,,1088,4.286407766990291
2164193,5,B00063MCI4,Some friends of mine had never seen this series so I brought it over to their place and we didn't stop till we watched all three seasons!!! Took two days straight but it was well worth it to see the looks on their faces after that last episode... Not ruining it for anyone so yeah.... Super disappointed they didn't pick this one up for a fourth season or more!,1366070400,,361,4.246376811594203
2164194,5,B00063MCI4,I bought this as a present for my husband. This got a 5 star rating from him -he thoroughly enjoys it. Quality of the dvd is good. Good entertainment if you like adventure shows.,1362182400,,178,4.264705882352941

2164197,5,B00063MCI4,This is one of those great tv series that did not get much attention although it was amazing. It is funny and dramatic while still staying serious. I loved watching every minute of it on tv and now I can watch them when ever I want!,1340928000,,232,4.065217391304348
2164198,5,B00063MCI4,"If you are looking at reviews of the third season of The Lost World, you already know what its about and the characters and that (you just wanna know if its just as good as the other two and what the ending is...So!!!)

I remember watching this series when I was a younger but didn't remember the name of it for the longest time! So when I found out the name and looked on Amazon I was so happy to see all three seasons on here so I bought the first season just to make sure it was what I remembered. It was and it got me hooked that I bought the second season and that just kept me going that I ordered the last season. I couldn't stop watching until I got to the last 3 episodes....it took me over 2 weeks to watch the last three because of the obvious its the end, theres no more and I was wondering how they left it.....and oh my god I AM SO UNHAPPY on the ending....I love the show and i loved the third season just as much as the other two but the last 5 minutes of the last episode just does horrible things to me!! Theres a huge cliffhanger and it says TO BE CONTINUED....UGHH it frustrates me and it makes me so sad. We will never know what happened to the characters that we have became so close too, unless by some extreme miracle after what 10 years there will be an conclusion to it...which i seriously doubt....",1333497600,2,1325,4.076628352490421
2164199,4,B00063MCI4,The Lost World Season 2 is one ot the three seasons in the collection. I really loved the series when it was on. The cast was terrific and I was in love with Jennifer O'Dell. A must see three seasons.,1314403200,,200,4.025
2164200,4,B00063MCI4,"I am a longtime fan of the Lost World series, and have written, I think, 27 fan fictions about it. I have been an administrator on two fan sites. I know the show, the characters, and why we fans adored this now defunct (if classic) series. I loved all of the characters, save perhaps for one who impressed me as being a bit prissy. I was especially impressed with Special Guest Star Lara Cox as Finn in the Third Season; she is a superb, very versatile actress whose career I have continued to follow.

In other words, I know the show and agree that it's three seasons of terrific Saturday afternoon adventure. If the TV stations that carried it hadn't kept shuffling it around in their schedules, I think it would have been a major success. It was a bit silly at times, and the John and Marguerite theme dragged on for too long before it finally became evident that they'd marry. I like the show. I endorse all favorable reviews that you'll read here, and I bought all three seasons on DVD. (Yes, from Amazon.com, as I recall.)

The scorpion in the soup (there, that's original!) is that some of the Third Season disks are flawed! That is especially vexing, for it is only in Season Three that one finds Finn, and I have a crush on that girl! When I had trouble playing some of the disks, I returned that set. The replacement set also had some bad disks, not necessarily the same ones. I frankly have trouble playing them on both my DVD player and on my computer. My brother (a software engineer) examined the disks and said that they are poorly made, by a different firm than that which produced the first two seasons' DVDs.

Now, to be fair, I posted about this on a fan board, and others hadn't had my problems with the sets they got. Maybe there was just a batch that suffered from bad quality control.  But order with caution. Do it; you can exchange a bad set. I just hope you have better luck than I did. It'd be a sad thing to miss the growing romance between M&R and the great episodes with Finn. I like the way that she and Challenger were bringing out the better qualities of each other. And you did get to see Finn and Veronica bond and become sisterly after Veronica returned. I doubt that any male fan minded two hot blondes on the show!

Be very cautious about buying any season of this program. If you get hooked, you'll lust after all three seasons! These people became almost family to me. I have never felt that way about ANY other TV show. (""The Lost World"" is my only venture into the dubious world of fandoms.)

So: do buy the lot, all three seasons. But don't be astonished if you have to exchange disks from the Third Season. That, and some reservations about certain episodes being a little silly or inconsistent with other episodes not written by the same scribes is my only caveat about the show. (After Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens took over as Executive Writers, the storylines became consistent.)

2164201,5,B00063MCI4,"How cruel they did not as least finish the cliff hanger. I enjoyed watching it when I could when it was on TV. I have been thrilled to find the DVD's. Great fun. I have been  waiting for Malone and Veronica to reunite. Now every one is seperated. Buggers!.

Enjoyed. The actors really acted in this show. They made the show. Australia is beautiful. The scripts were good. Nice imagination.",1310169600,4,389,4.542857142857143

2164203,5,B00063MCI4,"I wrote my rave on the 2nd set. This completed the set. Producers messed up by not finishing the show. Jennifer O'Dell was great and all the cast threw themselves into this show. Sorry if I hurt your feelings but this was better than ""lost"", the really messed up TV series.",1279670400,2,273,4.372549019607843
2164204,5,B00063MCI4,This series is under-rated and quite good.  The people who invented the current Lost series must have watched the adventures of this band of people lost in a strange time and space jungle.,1269820800,2,188,4.696969696969697
2164205,4,B00063MCI4,This season was not as good as 1 and 2 but it was okay. This season was still worth buying.,1267488000,2,91,3.6

2164207,5,B00063MCI4,I watched all three seasons with great glee.  I loved them all.  The actors and actresses were wonderful.  The realization of the plateau was remarkable.  It is a total shame that season three ends with a to be continued and leaves us all hanging.  I do hope that one day they will make a movie and show us what occurred and leave us wanting more.,1246579200,,347,4.276923076923077

Anyway, GREAT SHOW! GREAT SEASON!!!",1190592000,,285,4.377358490566038
2164212,2,B00063MCI4,"I have awarded 5 stars to the previous seasons, and heartbrokenly decided for only 2 on this one as it is greatly disappointing to realize that there is no ending to this story. It has been a most amazing journey as I ventured into Season 1, Season 2 and Season 3 of The Lost World, and it is so sad that fans like me do not get the joy of living the final chapter.

What about 1 more episode???
How about a book???

Please....?",1188000000,3,428,4.083333333333333
2164213,4,B00063MCI4,"Though this is ""NOT"" the best installment in the Sir Author Conan Doyle's Lost World season(s). It was entertaining never the less. If your fans of Lord John Roxton and the crafty Marguerite Crux? As I am, then you will enjoy this, because they really carry most of the show. With the absence of Ned Malone and Veronica, the show is only half of what it could have been. My only complaints? After building up this(on again, off again)budding romance between Malone and Veronica during the 2nd season? Gets totally hacked by the beginning of the 3rd season. They separate as ""indifferent"" friends? Next, they introduce a female character from a alternate post 21st century apocalyptic horror, named Flynn. In my opinion, the character is ""totally"" uninteresting, a poor imitation of Veronica and detracts from the others.

Action, Adventure, Romance- it's all here. But, it really does not follow what came before. The premise of ""Getting Home"" seems to have been lost by the end of the season. The series's writers seem to be in a fog most of the time. Rudderless and without direction. You can tell this episode by episode. Veronica's history/back story is totally changed? Malone leaves the group to go ""find himself"". . . in a land of carnivorous dinosaurs? Nice one. All comes to a culmination of a spectacular cliffhanger. That will leave you excited and disappointed. Because there is absolutely ""no"" resolution. But then, the best cliffhangers have that effect. Overall, I gave this DVD box set ""3"" stars. But added one more, in homage to the cool previous seasons that came before.

I'd suggest this DVD set ""only"" to the most devoted fan(s).",1186876800,2,1650,4.889285714285714

2164216,3,B00063MCI4,"I got into this show with season 1 which I liked the cover and bought it from amazon.com.

First it was cheesy, but by time it got better and at the end of one season I decieded to buy another two. season 2 was really good. story line was far more sophisticated and visuals wer decent enough. but season 3...

I really dissapointed. some episodes had the worst and most childis stories that a a person can imagine. once I thought what are the producers? 8? hadn't they enough childhood? transefring into another time and place with same actors and actresses as different phenomenas was acceptable once but it seemed they liked it and continue it...

and the worst episode was that westen episode! I barely ended it to satisfy myself that I whatched all the series without any skip!

and in other episode, there was not really a logic story, I hoped that they used primitive visual effects instead of that freak stories. they ruined the series in season 3 and it was predictable that they couldn't go on any further!

But worst or best, it was not decent they abandon the series without a certain end!

my suggestion is, they could gather the stars one more time and produce 90 minues show as the series finale. they owe fans at least that favor!",1139184000,5,1245,4.511111111111111
2164217,5,B00063MCI4,"I just started watching The Lost World, maybe 2 months ago. (2005)I have planned to order all 3 years series, but I would love to see the adventurers go home to London sometime.

It hurts me to see shows, that does not finish off with a happy ending, when the show does not want to go on, any more.

What do I do? Dream of a happy ending myself?

If you are a fan (like me), I think we should get together and see we can get them to do one more last season, ending with them going to, where their hearts desire.",1132617600,6,511,3.941747572815534
2164218,3,B00063MCI4,"I stumbled upon season 2 of this show while channel surfing at 3:00 am. Somehow the show became a ritual viewing, so much so that when it jumped channels and moved to an even more inconvenient time (!), I made an effort to tune in. Season 2 was one of those ""this is so bad it's good"" guilty pleasures. The actors play their parts well and the stories became ever more ridiculous, and paradoxically all that much better. Season 3 though..... contract disputes limited David Orth and Jennifer O'Dell to a handful of episodes. O'Dell is definitely missed. Her replacement, Finn, from a post-apocalyptic future never really fits in with the cast. The unforgiveable flaw of Season 3 is its cliffhanger ending. While a good episode, the series' subsequent cancellation makes it very bittersweet. I hate only getting half the story. This is not the greatest adventure show, but is head and shoulders better than contemporaries such as Hercules: The Legendary Adventures and Xena: The Warrior Princess.",1127260800,7,995,4.9640718562874255
2164219,5,B00063MCI4,"That may not be a good thing, as the show was cancelled right after the big question was asked, what was Veronica's reason for coming to the plateau?

I can't believe they weould leave millions of fans, including myself, without an answer, and It's been three years!

For most of the season the only three main explorers left are George Challenger, Margarite Krux. I belive that's how you spell here last name, and John Roxton.

After his time in the supernatural world, Ned Malone left to seek self awareness, and Veronica went off on her own adventure.

But fear not, more characters make their prescence, as a new woman by the name of Finn was accepted by the three after Challenger perfected a time travelling machine that transported the three into the world right after World War three. After some brief fights with bounty hunters, who have cool cars I must add, Finn comes to join them.

The episodes are unique, besides the time travelling machine theres also: One where a demon is dug up inside a jar by another expedition and leads to a lot of confusion of who is possessed and how.

There is also one where a meteorite falls and almost causes a new ice age, along with bringing an alien race that are frozen but are alive. I liked the idea of how the people lived, but it was a little too creepy, for me that is.

More episodes show Margarites past and her real reason why she came to the Lost World, a WW1 pilot who has survived with a case full of metal that all the main explorers seem to have a unique bond to.

And a showdown by a returning Veronica and a swordsman who claims to be the protector of the plateau. At least I think he said he was the protector. It was also great seeing Veronica and Finn meet for the first time. A harsh introduction, but they became friends.

This season also has the perfect ending of the romance between Margarite and John Roxton while they were trapped inside a cave. It thought it was a really good ending to the suspense of whether or not they would hook up.

With a great cast, some unique shows, most of  which I didn't name, and a big cliffhanger of an ending, you should definately add this to your Lost World Collection.",1117238400,5,2179,4.4089775561097255
2164220,4,B00063MCI4,"It's easy for Arthur Conan Doyle purists to find fault with the Australian-produced ""Lost World"" television series, but for sheer escapism, this enjoyable series had a lot to offer fans; better-than-average CGI dinosaur effects, a wonderful, attractive cast who could actually act, storylines that were always entertaining, if frequently derivative, and, best of all, the glorious, lush Australian landscape, substituting for an uncharted plateau in South America.

The series was an extremely expensive one to produce, requiring a large group of investors (including New Line) to finance it, and by the third season, further difficulties arose, most notably the Australian work laws, which forced American actress Jennifer O'Dell (the gloriously sexy Veronica), and Canadian actor David Orth (American journalist Ned Malone) to severely limit their appearances. While losing two leads could have been disasterous, the series actually became more interesting, with the long-smouldering romance between daredevil Lord John Roxton (Will Snow) and gorgeous 'Woman with a Past' Marguerite Krux (Rachel Blakely) finally igniting, and the introduction of a young refugee from the future, Finn (Lara Cox), providing a sarcastic foil to team leader George Challenger (Peter McCauley). With the easy comraderie developed over the show's run, and the improved writing a frequently smaller cast provided, Season Three of ""The Lost World"" was a continuing pleasure.

Sadly, after producing the ""Cliffhanger to end ALL Cliffhangers"" as the season finale, funding ran out, and ""The Lost World"" was not picked up for a fourth season. While the series has a large, very loyal fan base, and the entire cast have expressed a willingness to return to their roles, frequent attempts to revive it, at least as a 'Made-for-TV' movie, have failed, and it appears unlikely that the fate of Professor Challenger's band of adventurers will ever be resolved.

If you are a fan (like me), Season 3 will complete a cherished collection; if you have never seen ""The Lost World"", buying this collection will provide you with some of the most exciting, romantic episodes of a truly remarkable fantasy series, and will certainly whet your appetite for the first two seasons, which are available on DVD, as well!
