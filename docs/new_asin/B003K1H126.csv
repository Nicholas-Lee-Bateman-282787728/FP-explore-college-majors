8398635,5,B003K1H126,"An excellent drama about technical issues, personality conflicts at a time of rapid airline expansion. Good story excellent acting all round.",1488672000,,141,5.761904761904762
8398636,5,B003K1H126,"I was unaware of this movie, until I stumbled upon it, where else but amazon. i really enjoyed the movie.it was very crisp and clear.peter cushing is my all-time favorite actor, so  if you're a petie fan you will enjoy this very unsual role he played in this film.",1455753600,,264,4.387755102040816
8398637,3,B003K1H126,"Great story based loosely on the British Comet aircraft. Way too talky, somewhat formulaic British film. Could have been a classic but isn't. The female lead who plays Bernard Lee's daughter is very good. Sly performance by George Sanders as a smooth lawyer.",1427328000,,258,5.023255813953488
8398638,3,B003K1H126,"Loved the book, movie was okay. The book is able to build the back story for the characters better. Nevertheless, for it's time, a good movie.",1372723200,,142,4.5
8398639,5,B003K1H126,"I got this because Cushing was in it and I like british tv and movies.
This has George Sanders too. It's a good drama about an airline and a
pilot wrongly accused of a plane crash. Cushing has small part but good.
the movie is a well made drama and worth watching over and over.",1370736000,2,278,4.072727272727272
8398640,2,B003K1H126,"I confess that I did not watch the entire movie because, in spite of what it says on the box, it was not a widescreen transfer. It was, instead, pan and scan. Shame on VCI.",1360627200,,172,3.942857142857143
8398641,3,B003K1H126,"Boy, what can you say? Peter Cushing, Bernard Lee, George Sanders, with a cast like this and a subject taken from a real-life plane crash I guess I hoped for a better movie. But it's just not that good for some reason. The plot is kind of muddled, with a lot of plot exposition given in courtroom testimony into which we're dumped mid-trial. The middle of the film really drags with some ultra-cliched soap opera intrigue.

Somehow they've missed the mark, I suspect by not really tackling the technical issues. The real life Comet jet had certain unique design features that caused a couple of early crashes (before the later total disasters). Perhaps a more literate script with more details might have helped. They certainly could have given Peter Cushing a better part and cut out the jealous stewardess.

To see this kind of thing done right, see ""No Highway in the Sky"", which has the additional feature of having been written *before* the actual plane disaster that it so closely foretold. The real life Comet jet would have given the UK a real lead in jet passenger plane production but an insufficient understanding of metal fatigue doomed it. In Nevil Shute's book the ""Reindeer"" is the new design in question. The Comet wasn't produced until a few years later.",1336003200,3,1271,4.7727272727272725
8398642,3,B003K1H126,"This film had good actors and good direction, and it was worth what
I spent on the DVD. However I was disappointed by the weak
McGuffin.

That is the term invented by Alfred Hitchcock for the key ingredient in
the plot that everyone is chasing -- the jewels, the microfilm, the
beautiful princess or whatever. In this case the McGuffin was the
rather obvious fact that under hot and humid conditions the air is less
dense and therefore a higher speed is needed to take off a plane. It is
almost incredible that all those talented designers and skilled pilots did not
find the McGuffin until the final scene.",1299888000,,607,4.568807339449541
8398643,4,B003K1H126,"The older movies of this type are mostly soap operas. The current films are not even worth mentioning! But this flick is good, I mean, very good! I am a MS Flight Simulator user, so I can relate to the plot. The other review, and Amazon, already told you the story line. Even if you are just an air traveler, you should have no trouble understanding this. In aviation, you take off at a certain speed, based upon certain calculations. If you don't, and use a short runway, you are looking for TROUBLE IN THE SKY. The plane looks like a Comet. I can tell by the jet engines. A lot of nice shots of the plane and airports. I got a kick out of those old headphones! Get this one. I think you will like this---and there are no silly plots like snakes attacking passingers!",1282003200,4,768,4.267123287671233
