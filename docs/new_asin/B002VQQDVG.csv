8382350,5,B002VQQDVG,Demographer professors and professionals involved in the field getting out suppressed information that will dramatically affect our world. The first movie gets out a lot of information. The Population Bomb interviews the people and participants of groups that are for the catastrophically dramatic changes that are coming. A large amount of information that doesn't take a stand so much as giving factual information as well as logical estimates of the results coming. Great for people who want to know what is happening without political agendas bring shoveled at them.,1397260800,,570,5.415730337078652
8382351,1,B002VQQDVG,"Anyone with even a rudimentary grasp of exponential mathematical functions and common sense would understand that this ""documentary"" has but a miniscule basis in fact. Although economic growth has been dependent on population growth thus far, this is clearly not a sustainable model, not for individuals, not for the environment, and certainly not for any country. If the filmmakers are worried about the economy, I would direct them to countries such as India, which has less than a third of the US' land area, but well over three times its population.

I'm glad they did not mention the mendacious and specious ""argument"" about being about to fit the world's population in the state of Texas. That's not the issue here. That's not what environmentally responsible individuals are arguing. We simply cannot sustain the current world population ad infinitum; something must give. Either we find a way to stop breeding like rabbits, or we run out of food. I shouldn't have to mention the obvious consequences of famine, war and cannibalism that will inevitably result if we take the former route. I suggest we castrate the entirety of the Quiverfuls and the Duggar Swarm at once.

Reducing the population will increase the average share of resources that each individual human (and animal) will have available to use, and will therefore benefit all of us. It really is that simple. We must stop being ""fruitful"" or we will go extinct.",1355356800,,1433,5.016806722689076
8382352,5,B002VQQDVG,"Demography is destiny as the saying goes.  If you want to understand where our economy and culture is headed watch these films.  As a father of five and a homeschooling dad, I want to prepare my children for the times they will be living and raising a family in.  I have decided to incorporate these films into our curriculum to help prepare my children for a much different world than I grew up in.",1347321600,7,399,4.364864864864865
8382353,5,B002VQQDVG,"This is very inspiring and instructing documentary. The delivery was timely, and the packing was excellent. I would recommend, without any hesitation, to purchase this documentary, not only for social workers and politics, but also for families.",1323820800,7,245,5.648648648648648
8382354,2,B002VQQDVG,"Demographic Winter throws a lot of charts and numbers at the viewer. They tell a bleak story of a declining human population (particularly in the West), and explains that this is bad because it hurts the economy. So far, so good.

But the producers go beyond explaining the crisis to explaining what is to be done. The problems are, it seems, women's rights, high degrees of wealth, the decline of the traditional family, and the secularization of society. In no uncertain terms, the viewer is told that such developments are bad and even unnatural. My jaw dropped to hear one of the talking heads explain that the solution is a return to patriarchy - ""properly understood"". I'm conservative and religious, but the assertion that the only way to save humanity is to undo women's liberation and reinforce (by law? not sure) heterosexual marriage seems well beyond any data that has been collected. Yes, some studies have demonstrated that long marriages are happy marriages, but many of the claims thrown around at the end of the film lack the pretty charts that cluttered its uncontested first half. Why?

The reason for all of this is simple: it's Mormon propaganda. The two production companies are based in Utah. The director's earliest films were biopics about early LDS heroes. The Latvian MP interviewed has a lengthy, religion-infused article up on a website of a traditional-family advocacy group - with Mormon Elders on its board of trustees. I can't confirm with the interwebs that she herself is a Mormon, but I'd wager she is.

I have no problem with the data, and I really have no problem with the opinion, the cry for a return to traditional values. But it is disingenuous for this group to make these pleas for wealthy Western people to return to traditional, patriarchal, fertile, religious households without making plain that the film is spearheaded and likely underwritten by those whose religious views are identical to the film's intimations. If you were going to watch a biopic about The Real Osama Bin Laden, you'd want to know if the documentarian was a fundamentalist Islamist. If you are going to watch a documentary about how Science Proves We Must Have Twelve Children and Not Divorce, you'd want to know that the producers are Mormon.

And, on a lesser note, where is the obviously missing counterargument that WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF EARTH TO PUT OUR KIDS IN? Somebody has to stop having kids. I guess we just hope that enough people go atheist that it balances out...",1314662400,4,2495,4.863529411764706
8382355,5,B002VQQDVG,"JUST FINISHED THE 2nd DVD.  I LOVE HAVING NEW INTELLIGENT INFORMATION LAID OUT LIKE THIS SHOW DOES.  I LEARNED MORE NEW THINGS,  IT GAVE ME MORE KNOWLEDGE WITH WHICH TO WORK.  NOW I WILL SPEND MANY HOURS AND TRY AND LEARN AS MUCH AS I CAN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT.  LIKE GLENN BECK SAYS,  NEVER TRUST ANYTHING - DO YOUR OWN HOMEWORK!  BECAUSE OF HIM I HAVE READ MORE BOOKS AND RESEARCHED MORE INFO THESE PAST 2 YRS THAN EVER BEFORE IN MY LIFE!!  A VERY INFORMATIVE AND THOUGHT PROVOKING DVD.",1299024000,5,485,4.311111111111111
8382356,5,B002VQQDVG,"Like all documentaries of this genre, you have to be cautious of the fear factor.  When placed in its proper perspective, the initial premise is well supported by arguments posed by educated and informed people.  The information gives you an opportunity to build upon your own interpretations of the activities happening around us, in our ever changing world.  If the aging population interests you, I would recommend this be one of a group of resources you use to investigate what is happening and what the potential consequences may look like.  They may not look anything like this; but, at least this input is more credible than some of the ideas posed by my buddies around the card table one night a week.",1297555200,3,709,4.786885245901639
8382357,5,B002VQQDVG,"The first one of  the set, ""Demographic Winter: the decline of the human family"" is certainly thought provoking and challenges some of the received wisdom with respect to the human population on earth. Whereas most people on earth seem to think human beings are causing climate change, this video makes a good case for the prospect that the real issue in the future will be whether there are enough people to keep the economies of the world going. The ageing population is a real issue.
The sequel to the first DVD is not as good in my opinion, although this may be oweing to the fact that it is ""more of the same"" type information. In my country, Australia, they are thinking of putting Al Gore's ""An Inconvenient Truth"" on the school curriculum. I would suggest that if they do, then they should put these two on the curriculum also, for a bit of balance.",1293667200,15,857,4.529032258064516
