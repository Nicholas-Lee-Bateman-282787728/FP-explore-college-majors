7931404,5,B000055ZGJ,"Very nice tape. This may say it is just for beginners but it also good intermediate ans advanced levels who want a fresh change of pace or who want to add varieties to their workouts. I got this tape as a present for my birthday,I thought it wasn`t going to be that good. I ended up loving it.

  I do this tape in the morning,at night sometimes and mostly after all my weightlifting and aerobics tapes. I adds extra strch to my joints and leaves me feeling great. Tamille Webb is a very good intructer,cues well and shows you the stretches very carefully. This tape really has improved my flexibility. I want to check out some of her other stretch tapes for some new variety. Trust me buy this tape. It will really improve flexibility.",1152230400,2,736,4.437037037037037
7931405,5,B000055ZGJ,"I'm an intermediate exerciser and really enjoyed this tape.  I just started doing yoga a year ago and yoga can sometimes be strenuous.  You don't have to psych yourself up for this tape.  The stretches are easy to do and Tamilee points out modifications throughout the tape.  Each 10 min. section stretches out your entire body.  Obviously, you get different stretches in each section - standing is first, then sitting in a chair then floor stretches.  I usually do one section at a time.  It's great for cooling down after cardio or weights.  It's also perfect to do at night before bedtime.  Though the title says it's for beginners - I think all levels will benefit from this tape.",1089936000,3,684,4.680672268907563
7931406,5,B000055ZGJ,"This is a great tape to use after weight lifting or aerobics as a way to wind down. Ten minutes doesn't take very long and we use one of the ten minute segments. If all you are wanting to do is to stretch and not exercise beforehand, then maybe another tape is better. But when you use this after another exercise, it is quick, easy, and delightful.",998611200,9,349,4.223880597014926
7931407,2,B000055ZGJ,"This video contains three 10-minutes stretch routines, one standing, one sitting on a chair and one on the floor.  The standing routine is a pretty basic set of stretches.  They do the job.  I found that except for the stretches (such as triceps) that are the same in all three, the sitting and floor stretches were useless.  I am not especially flexible but even so I did not feel a stretch on most of the moves.  I suppose the tape might work if you have very limited range-of-motion or have done no physical activity at all in a very long time.  Overall, this tape is a waste of time and money.",997401600,14,597,4.333333333333333
7931408,5,B000055ZGJ,"I have also written a review for Tamilee's ""Beginner's Stretch for Flexibility"". I love her videos and have used them for years. I also use free weights and my treadmill.  This video is good because she breaks it down into three 10 minute sessions, standing, sitting and floor stretches.  I enjoy this video so much I usually do all three.
I am 60 years old and have fibromyalgia.  Between the stretching videos and keeping in shape I feel pretty good.  I do know that since doing the stretching videos my flexibility has improved dramatically.  I would recommend this video to anyone who wants to feel relaxed, energized and flexible.
Thank you Tamilee.",992476800,14,654,4.803571428571429
