1377912,4,B00004YRWY,"Though simplified from Fritz Leiber's great novel ""Conjure Wife"", this little remembered horror film of the sixties is a first-rate, highly intelligent supernatural thriller, on a par with ""Curse Of The Demon"", and without that film's silly looking demon.

1377913,4,B00004YRWY,"Based on a classic Fritz Leiber novel (Conjure Wife), this is one of the scariest witchcraft movies ever made. Premise is that female witches are actually very common in day-to-day surroundings -- in this case a college where there is a lot of faculty rivalry, and it is the witch-wives, not the sceptical husbands, who get advancement and tenure, etc. for their men. The stone eagles coming to life and attacking the hero are one of the best scenes ever (even though this is a black-and-white low-budget movie where you can actually see the wire tethers that were attached to the real birds used). And that scene where the hero goes on a frantic drive in a storm to rescue his wife from drowning and is a MINUTE too late is horrifying.",998524800,5,736,4.583333333333333
1377914,5,B00004YRWY,"Despite the lurid title, ""Burn, Witch, Burn"" is a very scary, well-made movie. Taken from the Fritz Leiber classic, ""Conjure Wife"" this film version is somewhat different from the book. Janet Blair is chillingly maniacal as a modern day witch, and has so much hidden malignancy it shocks you. There are incredible special effects, especially considering the time when this movie was made. I won't spoil it for you but watch the gargoyles...carefully! Modern day witchcraft in a university setting, replete with professional rivalries, jealousies and secret, vengeful spells...if you enjoy witchcraft, excellent effects, atmospheric settings, wonderful performances and a great story, then this is for you! Filmed in black and white for an even more ominous feel...very Edgar Allen Poe. A cinematic ""tarn."" Enjoy!",984096000,27,812,5.504
1377937,5,B00004YRWY,"Great British horror film from the early 60's.  A up-and-coming university professor has a wife who practices magic (learned from a Voodoo priest) to protect hubby from negative forces that want to bring him down.  When he finds out and makes her trash her magical protections the evil really hits the fan.  The evil forces go after him with a vengeance with incidents and situations that by themselves are unsettling, but hitting him with a one-two-three punch REALLY make him wonder.  The scenes at the coastal graveyard are incredibly atmospheric, and that lonely beach at nighttime is beautiful.  My only issue with the story is that the husband MAKES his wife get rid of her magic.  I object to spouses ordering each other about.  Marrieds should be equal.  But this was the 60's, so what can one expect.  The DVD-R is excellent quality.  Highly recommended.",1419120000,,863,4.889655172413793

1377945,5,B00004YRWY,"College professor owes his success to his beautiful wife, who happens to be a witch.  Her spells and charms have made his life easy, but he is a realist who knows nothing of his wife's craft -- until one day he discovers her secret charms and amulets.  He forces her to destroy everything despite her pleading with him not to do it.  Now his disbelief in the supernatural begins to be challenged.  Strange things happen, his life is changing for the worse, and he has no clue what is going on.  As he becomes increasingly upset by how his life is changing, it becomes evident that his wife is not the only witch in town.

If you don't believe in the supernatural, or even if you do, you will enjoy the crescendo suspense throughout this show.  You will not fall asleep during this one.  No gore, just real suspense and terror in sinister black and white.",1399939200,,854,4.42948717948718
1377946,4,B00004YRWY,"Over the course of a weekend, a rationalist sociology professor (Peter Wyngarde) discovers his wife (Janet Blair) has been practicing black magic to advance his career and protect him from bad juju in his department. After he forces her to burn all of her conjuring fetishes and charms, he returns to school on Monday to find his life has fallen to pieces. The source of this little-known British horror film was Fritz Lieber's novel CONJURE WIFE, a favorite of the screenwriters Richard Matheson and Charles Beaumont, about faculty wives practicing the dark arts to advance their husbands' careers. The best witch stories are often explorations into the darker forms of misogyny, and the hypercompetitive world of department politics (with suspicions faculty members on the rise were being helped illicitly by their wives) makes an interesting avenue for such a tale. Some of the film's best parts are at the beginning, when we begin to get a nasty taste of the department backstabbing at a bridge party; afterwards, the hostess's frantic search for what one of her guests may have left behind is one of the finest sequences in the film. It inspires the director, Sidney Hayers, into some of his most inventive camerawork (we see from the undersides of tables and sofas as Blair's fingers go exploring), that he also uses for some of the film's later showpieces, including Wyndgarde's frantic race in his car against a bus his wife is on, and the magical attack of a giant eagle near the film's end (which inspired its original title, NIGHT OF THE EAGLE).

Unfortunately, Hayers is so focused on ratcheting up the film's intensity that he almost never gives the actors time to breathe, or even provide the exposition that could make more sense of what Blair and Wyngrade face together: some of the evil magic used against them seems to involve only hypnosis, and other times curses, and other times the actual transmutation of reality--but we never find out the rules to any of this. (This is the rare horror film where too much is left unexplained.) Wyngrade and Blair--both unusual choices for their roles--are also pushed a bit too hard; Wyngarde's magnetism allows him to fare better, but Blair seems too histrionic and one-note, as is Margaret Johnston as another faculty wife and also a colleague of Wyngarde's. The film isn't quite in the league of NIGHT OF THE DEMON, but compared to most other British horror films of its era, it's really worth watching.",1398038400,2,2464,4.908872901678657
1377957,5,B00004YRWY,"A most interesting movie.
Definitely NOT for lovers of CGI in overdrive, but it does show how suspense and atmosphere can be very effectively built up by far simpler means.
I'm not sure it needs the ""spooky"" spell-casting by a narrator, done in total darkness for at least five minutes at the very beginning of the movie.
Nor the corny graphic at the very end either....""DO YOU BELIEVE""???
The movie itself is enough to pose the same challenging question, but perhaps the editors thought the point needed underlining for the less imaginative amongst us.
To me it seems totally unnecessary.

Great black-&-white photography with some incredible camera angles ensure interest.
The unusual set decorations all add to the spooky atmosphere.

The locations are excellent too, ...with a huge ""gothic"" styled university, complete with Elizabethan chimneys and eagle finials and statues looming everywhere. (It was released as ""Night of the Eagle"" in America. Not the best of titles in my opinion.)

The cast are all good, ....even the bit players, perhaps with the possible exception of the young man who takes on the role of a jealous university student who eventually pulls a gun on the professor.
His subsequent crying scene is certainly not the strongest.
Other than that the acting is more than competent throughout.
Janet Blair plays a university wife who has managed her husband's career amongst a group of resentful and sometimes downright hostile academics by adopting a policy of ""protections"".
These consist of charms and amulets to not only promote good fortune, but to block negative and hurtful influences too. (Of which there seems to be an inordinate amount BTW.)

Husband Peter Wyngarde has been enjoying a dream run of rapid promotions and wonderful student relations, but oblivious to the reasons for his rise through the ranks. That is until he accidentally discovers that his house and clothing are riddled with witchy little sachets,talismans and potions and he forces his wife to confess.
His firmly held theories against all superstition will not let her continue and he oversees the destruction of all the protective objects in a fire. This of course is much to the distress of his wife.
""I cannot be responsible for what might happen if you make me give up my protections!""
Why she does not then resort to invisible spells and hexes to replace the protection that had been given by the burnt items is not explained. Perhaps she hasn't reached that level of witchcraft competency yet? She's obviously still very much a prop-reliant witch as she seems totally unable to protect even herself against some very effectively applied hexes of the voo-doo type, once her collection of protections is destroyed.
The ramifications and consequences of that very action fall swiftly indeed and are most damaging to her husband's career. Accusations of the rape of an infatuated female student being the first to become evident.

Now Peter Wyngarde (the professor) has quite a few ""charms"" of his own, not the least being possessed of quite the fetchingly athletic body. Every opportunity is taken by the director to show off his lead man's attractions too.
Watch for the scene where the good professor goes upstairs to bed and slips his shirt off. Notice how the camera the artfully exposes and lingers on his naked masculine hairy chest, and of course the wardrobe department helps everything along by failing to provide him with any pyjama tops at all!
Oh and diligently ensuring every pair of Mr Wyngarde's trousers are incredibly tightly cut.
You will even be able to easily ascertain his surgical status with certainty at one stage!!!
Quite the homo-erotic little display really. Even to having the camera look directly up at his groin as he lies back in a semi-helpless state with his legs spread wide in an armchair. His wife has plied him with alcohol....

He also manages to miraculously survive what appears to be a direct head-on collision with a very large lorry at one stage!
Not so much as a broken bone or anything at all that prevents him acting most athletically throughout the remainder of the movie.

Margaret Johnston gets to chew the scenery as the evil witch. Despite being lumbered by the part's requiring a deformity, she manages just the right balance of malice and scorn for the ""unbeliever"", .....which the professor claims to be. Their showdown is a tense play between the occultist and the realist.
It must be said that the psychologist's theories start to show more than a few cracks when put to the test and his subconscious starts to chip away at his once so firmly held declarations.
""I do not believe"" begins as his mantra, written on the chalkboard as part of his lecture. This assertion progressively crumbles to ""maybe"", ...until the word ""not"" is later symbolically blotted out to read ""I do believe"" when the professor retreats against his chalkboard when he's under a particularly vivid psychic attack.

As mentioned, the ""effects"" are strictly low-budget here. At one stage you can clearly see the fishing line tied to the real eagle to ensure it flies at the professor. However do not let this discourage you from watching. Much is done here with the power of suggestion, ...which of course is a strong link to the theme itself.
Hell itself does not open, spells cast do not result in immediate personal appearances by Lucifer, nor is the screen invaded by CGI conjured demonic fiends. (As has become the preserve of ""witchy"" movies nowadays!)
Despite the lack of any of this trickery, if the psychological aspect of the supernatural holds any interest for you, this movie will entertain throughout.

TIP: DO NOT watch the trailer BEFORE seeing the movie. I can't believe it gives away so much of the plot, revealing details about the characters that you are not supposed to realise until later in the story.",1391385600,3,5857,4.950152594099695

1377987,5,B00004YRWY,"5 Stars = Masterpiece

Truly a great supernatural occult film. A rare & overlooked gem!

A ambitious professor is moving up the ladder of academia at his college. He is moving up so quick, that others begin to become suspicious, angry, & covet his success. Little does he know that he is getting help from the occult, the very thing he tries to dispel to his students. He attracts the wrath of another occultist who wants him dead.

""Burn Witch Burn"" is as taught as a constrictors coil. It has ample amounts of suspense & dread. Tight direction, superior acting, & a intelligent script by one Richard Matheson (Twilight Zone, Outer Limits, Night Stalker, Legend of Hell House, Duel), that is perfect for this film. ""Burn Witch Burn"" ranks right up there with the greatest 50's, early 60's horror films. It ranks up there with ""Night of the Demon,"" & that is saying something!

1377989,5,B00004YRWY,"One of the best movies on the occult in the Horror canon, Director Sydney Hayer's 'BURN,WITCH,BURN' aka 'NIGHT OF THE EAGLE'-1962 ages like old wine and it also emerges as the definitive film version of author Fritz Leiber's 1943 novel 'CONJURE WIFE' which had been previously lensed as an 'INNER SANCTUM' Universal Horror with Lon Chaney Jr. directed by Reginald Le Borg titled 'WEIRD WOMAN'-1944.  The characters are flawless: British actor Peter Wyngarde thesping as the disbelieving husband would go on to appear as heroes and villains in classic sixties British television including 'THE AVENGERS' and 'DEPARTMENT S' as 'JASON KING' which would become a series in its own right; Janet Blair as Tansy, the wife dabbling in witchcraft in a role originally to star June Allyson; and Margaret Johnson as the eccentric wife of Colin Gordon who steals the film. Director Sydney Hayers who directed the excellent 'CIRCUS OF HORRORS'-1960 moves the affair at a brisk clip and keeps you in a state of breathlessness throughout.  Produced by 'THE AVENGERS' precursors Julian Wyntle and Albert Fennell, the film is right up there with the best British non-Hammer horrors such as John Llewellon Moxey's CITY OF THE DEAD' aka 'HORROR HOTEL'-1961 and Director Jacques Tourneur's 'NIGHT OF THE DEMON' aka 'CURSE OF THE DEMON'-1957.  MGM Limited had problems with the first releases of this disc but the one I had was flawless and better than the Laser Disc releases of old. The photography of Reginald Wyer is finally appreciated and the teaming of writers Richard Matheson and Charles Beaumont is inspired. It also includes the two and a half minute intro narrated by Paul Frees which gives the film a cheesy feel but slowly fades away as the events unfold.  The flimsy special effects climax of the stone eagle's animation actually plays much better on the small screen as Wyngarde's characters disbelieving mind is ripped right off its hinges as his body blots out the word 'not' on the blackboard which he wrote previously as 'I do not believe'.  The film would be the basis of the hit sixties series 'BEWITCHED' and further remakes but this is the version to experience.  Highly recommended.",1321056000,3,2186,5.008264462809917

The disc is from MGM's on demand line of DVD-Rs. It sports a decent transfer and an acceptable mono audio track. The only supplement is a trailer.

1378017,5,B00004YRWY,"Originally titled Night of the Eagle, 1962's Burn, Witch, Burn will satisfy classic horror fans. It has an excellent cast, a compelling plot, and high atmosphere. The film is in B&W, which adds to the creepy ambience. The story is centered in a university setting in a quiet English hamlet, where up-and-coming Professor Norman Taylor (Peter Wyngarde) is respected and admired by many. There are rivalries in this setting, with other academics vying for a coveted position at the university. When Taylor makes the shocking discovery that his devoted wife Tansy (Janet Blair) is dabbling in witchcraft to protect him and further his career, he destroys all her talismans and magic paraphernalia. Tansy warns him that this will bring bad luck and misfortune to them, but being a rational man, Taylor ignores her dire warnings.

Soon enough, strange and unfortunate things befall Taylor - he is almost run over by a truck, a female student claims he made advances to her, and Taylor begins to have serious doubts about his own personal beliefs regarding the supernatural. When Tansy runs off to their isolated cottage in an attempt to make things right, Taylor finds himself confronting some bitter truths and experiences a real dose of horror.

The cast does an excellent job in their respective roles - Wyngarde plays the cynical professor impeccably, and Janet Blair is credible as the obsessed witch who will go to any lengths to protect her husband. Then there's Margaret Johnston as Professor Flora Carr, who plays a significant role in the movie. The twists in the film keep it interesting and the effects are not altogether bad considering this movie was made in the 60s.

I love the Gothic feel of the movie, from the imposing university buildings to the sinister-looking eagles perched atop the turrets, the cottage by the seaside, the forbidding cemetery, etc. The score makes the viewer feel that something bad is about to happen any minute, and I was on the edge of my seat as I was watching this. I rank this as one of my favorite horror classics and my only regret is not having discovered it earlier.",1307318400,,2113,4.880222841225627

1378021,5,B00004YRWY,"Although it's seldom mentioned in critical surveys of classic horror, BURN, WITCH BURN (aka Night of the Eagle) is a terrific example of how far a film can travel on mood and characterization.  When a college professor learns his wife has been practicing black magic, he orders her to throw out or destory all her charms and occult items.  What he doesn't count on is that other practioners of the ""dark arts"" won't stand idly by while one of their own is forced to give up her witchy ways.

BURN, WITCH BURN bears a favorable resemblance to Jacques Tourner's excellent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Curse-of-the-Demon-Night-of-the-Demon/dp/B0000694WH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Curse of the Demon / Night of the Demon</a>: Moody black & white photography, strong performances, and a lead character who is doggedly determined to debunk the supernatural, even though he is surrounded by overwhelming evidence of its existence.  This culminates in a still nail-biting supernatural attack by a giant bird (hence the otherwise rather misleading ""Night of the Eagle"" alternate title for the film).

MGM has recently entered the ""manufactured on demand"" market, making disc on DVD-R's as ordered, to keep down costs.  While this may cause concern to viewers worried about quality in our High Definition World, rest assured that MGM has done a proper digital restoration with this one.  While there are no extras included, this is typical of these MOD releases.  Those of us who have spent years waiting or searching for favorite genre films to finally receive an ""official"" release understand that this may the only way in the forseeable future we will have the chance to own these films.

1378022,4,B00004YRWY,"NIGHT OF THE EAGLE (aka ""Burn, Witch, Burn"") is one of the most underrated thrillers of the Sixties.  A chilling study of paranoia versus skeptibility, the film provided musical comedy actress Janet Blair a rare opportunity to display her dramatic mettle onscreen, and features some striking B&W cinematography.

College professor Norman Taylor (Peter Wyngarde) looks to be leading a charmed life; he's in line for a prestigious promotion and married to the lovely Tansy (Janet Blair).  But he seems oblivious to the subtle rumblings of his colleages, many of whom harbour feelings about the ""new kid on the block"" stealing their rightful position.  Tansy knows better.  After their trip to Jamaica, Tansy picked up the art of voodoo and black magic, and uses special charms and fetishes located around their house as a shield of protection for Norman.  But when Norman discovers Tansy's secret, he destroys all the objects, and horrified Tansy now realises that Norman has left himself vulnerable to the person or person/s who'd rather see him dead than given any promotion at the college...

NIGHT OF THE EAGLE is a slow-burning chiller.  It's not really a conventional horror film, and I can't understand why it was included amongst the titles in MGM's original video series of ""Midnite Movies"" (it's now available on DVD in the United Kingdom under it's original title).  The lurid American re-titling of ""Burn, Witch, Burn"" refers to a line of dialogue in the film, but it conjures up an entirely wrong image of the movie as a whole.  Independently made in England on a very small budget, NIGHT OF THE EAGLE (based on the novel ""Conjure Wife"" by Fritz Leiber Jr.) is a very stylish and tasteful thriller.  Directed by Sidney Hayers, a dab hand at horror movies, the film has some really creepy scenes that are elevated into masterpieces by cinematographer Reginald Wyler.  The performances are well-pitched: Wyngarde and Blair have a winning chemistry, but it's Ms Blair who really comes into her own with a solid dramatic performance as Tansy.  A rare change of pace for Ms Blair, who was primarily a musical comedy girl.  Highly recommended.",1300579200,,2148,4.997191011235955
1378023,4,B00004YRWY,"If you liked CURSE OF THE DEMON, INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, and THE LAST MAN ON EARTH, have I got a movie for you! Although it has never quite reached the status of these classics, 1962's BURN WITCH BURN is nearly as good a fact which can probably be traced back to the film's source material, Fritz Leiber's novel CONJURE WIFE.  CONJURE WIFE took as its premise the theory that ALL women are practicing witches and all men are blissfully innocent of the fact none of their achievements is due not to their own abilities but to their wives' spells and magics. The film has narrowed down the novel's premise somewhat, although all the women in the cast appear to be playing their roles as if they weren't informed of this development. There were other serious changes made as well by the screenwriters, an important one involving the film's ending and another involving the film's true climax. One can understand both of these in view of the limitations of the times. But I'm getting ahead of myself.

Norman Taylor and his wife Tansy are newcomers at Hempnell College located somewhere in rural England. They are both relatively young, attractive people,and Norman is definitely upward bound with his sights set on the Chair of his department, a position which is being very hotly contested. All this, plus the fact that Tansy is an American, makes them outsiders in the college's tight-knit society. Norman, of course, is like all the other husbands and hasn't a clue as to what is really going on. He teaches his cultural anthropolgy course while never once noticing that young Margaret has a terrible crush on him or that her boyfriend, hostile Bill Abbott is so jealous he could s**t bricks. Tansy on the other hand, can feel the hatred and resentment in the very air around her, and she is completely convinced that someone is ""working against them"". But she's no fool. She knows her husband's scientific/analytical world has no place for the things in which she believes, so she thinks it best simply to leave him out of the loop and to take care of business without his knowledge.

Everything goes fairly well until Norman accidentally finds Tansy's stash of conjuring supplies and forces her to destroy them all in the fireplace, in effect leaving them completely defenseless against the evil that Tansy knows is out to get her beloved husband. The evil attacks almost instantly-- sometimes in small ways, sometimes in very dangerous ways. Eventually even skeptical Norman starts to get rattled by this strange string of occurrences, but by the time he does it may be too late to save himself and his self-sacrificing wife from death--or worse!

Although this film is not of quite the same high quality as CURSE OF THE DEMON it is still a classic that should be seen and enjoyed by all true genre fans. It was adapted for the screen by two of the most accomplished genre writers of their day--Richard Matheson and Charles Beaumont from Leiber's novel which is a pretty damn good read on its own The book differs enough from the film that it might still keep you guessing a bit. The screenwriting is terse and tense and somehow manages to keep what might be a silly story within the realm of possibilty. The capable direction of Sidney Hayers conveys an all important sense of reality. The locations shots are nice and we aren't at all studio bound for a change. We have beautiful views of crashing surf and appropriately ominous cemeteries when we need them. In short we have everything we need for a classic horror fim from an era that knew how to make them. Now you may NOT be bowled over by this film upon first viewing. I WAS, but then I am of the era and I saw it upon its initial release which makes a big difference. If it doesn't work for you the first time, promise me you'll watch it again. Trust me when I say that you will learn to love it!

Oh, it also has this really great openning done over a blank screen in which none other than Orson Wells exorcises any evil spirits that, having been drawn into the theater by the spells contained in the film, might be tempted to harm members of the audience. =)

This film has never had a US dvd release although it is available in Great Britain as a Region 2.",1222646400,8,4228,4.60079575596817
1378024,4,B00004YRWY,"Aka Night of the Eagle doesn't seem to get shown on television very much, which is really strange as its a cracking supernatural thriller. Peter Wyngarde (remember Department S?) stars with Janet Blair as Norman and Tansy Taylor. Its made clear right from the outset of the film that Norman is a sceptic and doesn't believe in the supernatural. Unfortunately Tansy does and is heavily involved in it.

The film was clearly influenced by Night of the Demon and it very nearly matches that film in most respects: The lighting and sound are excellent, its only 84mins long, so there really isn't a wasted minute, and the two leading performances are memorably good. Perhaps the only area where its a little weaker than Night of the Demon is the absence of any of that films occasional black comedy moments.

In short if you haven't seen this, then you've missed a minor classic that I believe will hold up to repeated viewings.",1200441600,,924,4.732919254658385

One of the more entertaining and enjoyable British occult films of the late `60's, ""Burn, Witch, Burn"" is available on DVD in Region 2 as ""Night of the Eagle,"" from Amazon's United Kingdom site and for $14.13 in U.S. dollars, isn't too bad a buy.  The quality is very good and is released by Optimum Home Entertainment, which is a premium British media company.  I also recommend Optimum's 1970 ""I, Monster"" (Region 2) pairing Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing in a ""Dr Jekyll & Mr. Hyde"" adaptation of the famed novel.  Again, excellent picture and sound qualities and for around $14.13, a nice buy.  Fans of Hammer films will also want to add these classic titles to their collections, also in Region 2- ""Hands of the Ripper"" (1970), ""Twins of Evil"" (1971), and ""Countess Dracula"" (1970) in a Special Edition with nice interviews with Ingrid Pitt. All of these titles are released from another premium British DVD studio, Network Entertainment and have very good picture and sound quality. Each of these Hammer titles go for $16.16 in U.S. dollars.

So if you haven't already got a Multi Region DVD player, it's time that you did!  Especially with so many great titles, both horror and suspense classics, being released in the United Kingdom!  There are a lot more titles available at Amazon's United Kingdom site that you may be looking for and there is even a Hammer Horror Collection box set featuring 21 classics Hammer films!

1378036,4,B00004YRWY,"A most intriguing film about a witch who uses her talents and skills to help further their career of her ungracious husband, a Cultural Anthropology Professor teaching at a prestigious University - a handsome gentleman who is desired by both the student body and the staff, thus complicating matters in his personal life.

 It all starts when he discovers his wife's Witchcraft paraphernalia, and forthwith disrespectfully and sacrilegiously strewns it all out on the living room table for her to find upon her arrival - she is of course taken aback by this incredibly crude gesture, and surprisingly agrees to destroy it in the fireplace against her better judgment, catering to his unperceptive pretensions. So everything goes up in flames in fizzles and sparks - she even removes a locket from around her neck containing his photo and protective herbs which he so stupidly tosses into the burning embers - and she, driven by a love profound, lunges to retrieve it, under his ignorant gaze.

 Now, at the very least, he could have been appreciative of her considerations, as it is truly the thought that counts here - personally, I found his actions to be incredibly insensitive and even antagonistic and unforgivable.

 He, on the other hand {or should I say, cerebral hemisphere}, solely acquiesces to analytical observation, not able to comprehend what is not seen. Of course, there are merits to both mentalities, and it is wisest to seek the Third Side, the balanced comprehension. As t Magic, the concept of The Intellectual Decompression Chamber explains it all {see The Satanic Bible}.

 Immediately after the immolation of her ritualistic articles, everything seems to go wrong. He is accused of coalescing with a female student {despite the fact that she is of legal age} who was infatuated with him anyway, thereby inciting the anger born of obvious jealousy, resentment, and frustration from her boyfriend who also accuses the Professor of thwarting his grades, and thereby holds him at gunpoint until quite literally slapped into submission; his wife becomes suicidal, undertaking a veritable death march for herself to the beach; on the way there, he figures out her intentions and races beside the bus she rides, and the cursed misfortunes continue- he is run off the road by a big black truck which seemingly materializes. He survives after plunging down an embankment, eventually making his way to the beach where upon inspecting some notes kept in an occult book entitled ""The Rites and Practices in Black Magic"", and goes forth in search of her upon the jagged cliffs until he finally reaches a lovely graveyard - a really peaceful and meditative place; and, taking indications from the grimoire, himself performs a makeshift ritual with the emotional intensity for the love of his wife, lighting some candles and placing her photo within the configuration along with some graveyard dirt. Midnight strikes, and finally tearfully knocks it all aside in exasperation. Then, to his joyful surprise, she appears at the crypt door zombified, and proceeds to take her to a Doctor-friend, where she is diagnosed as suffering from shock until she breaks out of her catatonic trance and demands to be taken home.

 While she lays resting therein, she awakens and attacks him with a knife, lurching about with a very discernable and recognizable limp; so he decides to take a trip back to his office discovering one of his female colleagues with the very same limp, lurking about in search of her own ritualistic implements - a photo of the couple. He emerges from the shadows confronting her about it, which she at first denies any association of nefarious intent. but eventually yields to his interrogation, thus confessing to her spell craft against he and his wife; even providing a little demonstration by igniting some parlor cards which represent his home. He rushes home to find the house ablaze, yet Tanzi is safe, rescued by firemen. On his way out, however, he experiences a strong visualization-projection from the Witch, in which he hallucinates a giant hawk come alive from stone to pursue him {even though the statue was an eagle}. She blasts an eerie Theremin recording mixed into one of his anti-witchcraft lectures {nice touch!}, propitiating a hypnotic effect, causing an atmosphere conducive to Sorceric manifestation. Finally, the demoralization occurs where the ""bad witch"" is 'defeated' - in this tale, in quite a poetic fashion.

 As an aside, I found the mansion to be quite familiar - then I recalled - it is either the same, or is one very similar to that depicted on the cover of King Diamond's ""Abigail II: The Revenge"" musickal novel.

 I did notice a small parallel in subsequent cultural cinema. This film being released in 1962 c.e., precluded Bewitched - and one may notice the wife-witch / husband-mortal pairing {I maintain that Witches should only seriously life mate with Warlocks, and vice-versa, while others are for fun exclusively}. In either case, the question arises: ""Why can't these spouses simply allow their mates to pursue their personal interests? Especially with the constructive attempt to make themselves successful?"" In these cases, it is because they feel threatened and insecure, and thereby attach the diabolical label, vilifying an inherent predisposition and passion - in short, they feel inadequate. But this is only a mere fictional microcosm of what the herd feels when confronted with a Witch or Warlock, typically reacting in various passive-aggressive behavior, preferring to retain their ignorance. So be it. As it is written in The Satanic Bible, ""Evil they name us, evil we are - why not take advantage of it and live!"" ASLV.

1378037,5,B00004YRWY,"It's interesting to see the comparison of this 1962 gem with the 1957 ""Curse of the Demon.""  While I favor ""Curse"" a little more, this tale of modern witchcraft still maintains it's eerie, if slowly paced, atmosphere of impending doom.  Since the plot has been so expertly detailed in other reviews, I might add that the film works mainly from the intensely atmospheric camerawork and direction by Sidney Havers.  Peter Wyngarde, a masculine though not particularly handsome fellow, oozes masculine domination in his well-balanced performance.  Margaret Johnston as the limping professor and fellow witch, is reminiscent of young Angela Lansbury, and her delight in her evil is a joy to watch.  And one can forgive Janet Blair if she did seem a little out of kilter for the leading role.  Blair up to to this point had been known for more lightweight and romantic roles; her performance doesn't helm the film, but neither does it detract from it.  The final scene involving the huge bird is still frightening.
I agree---it should join other classics in DVD.",1073779200,10,1057,4.971590909090909
1378038,4,B00004YRWY,"The 1962 supernatural thriller ""Burn Witch Burn"" has such a great reputation, that when watching this flick for the first time some may well be disappointed. After viewing this film initially, my reaction was ""What's all the fuss?"" After repeated viewings, I now appreciate this atmospheric brood fest.
I like the British locale of a small university, replete with ivy-covered walls, book-lined offices and shaded courtyards. I also love the sea-side cottage with yawning cliffs, abandoned graveyards and crashing waves. These sets are utilized for chief affect, and the actors earnest performances certainly give the film a respectable ambiance. A simple, if rather silly story, ""Burn Witch Burn"" details a young professor (Peter Wyngarde) who appears to be rising quickly within the collegiate hierarchy. We soon discover his wife is a full-fledged witch, casting spells to insure her husband's success. When the befuddled professor forces his wife to burn the unearthly trinkets, bad luck befalls them and someone, of course, has to pay. Throw into this occult mix the wife of a rival professor, boiling a few pots of her own ghostly herbs.
It's oddly, if not entertainingly, surreal to see these pseudo Donna Reeds adorned in perfect bouffants, eyes wide with anger, casting spells in order to guarantee the safety/success of their professional husbands. Margaret Johnston, as the rival witch, is especially hilarious as she waxes evil over a small voodoo doll through gritted teeth.
These are some disturbed ladies, and the men of ""Burn Witch Burn"" are helpless to change the growing tide of events. And that's probably what makes this unique British horror film so interesting. It's the games being played by seemingly innocent women behind closed doors. They are not powerless, but in fact, have complete control over not only their men's professional, but eventually their spiritual lives. Written by Richard Matheson and Charles Beaumont, two of the finest supernatural writers of this era (they both cut their teeth writing original ""Twilight Zone"" episodes), ""Burn Witch Burn"" is aided by some great dialogue and the crisp direction of Sidney Hayers.
How much one fears witchcraft will determine just how frightening this film is. For 1962 audiences, my guess is this film gave them the creeps. Witchcraft had really not been dealt with in a modern setting like this before. For today's audiences? Well, there's something oddly erotic about seeing frenzied Donna Reed look-a-likes weaving dark magic behind ominously closed doors.",1069632000,12,2541,5.292079207920792

It's set on a college campus where the faculty wives know a lot more about the petty academic turf wars than their allegedly smarter husbands.  Professor Norman Taylor (Peter Wyngarde) is in line for  a big promotion.  His wife, Tansy (Janet Blair) is sure her husband's charms and spells are responsible.  The costumes, acting style, and attitudes are a cinematic primer on late fifties sexual conflicts and idenities.  Stereotypes of male rationality and feminine intuition are sharpened to wicked points.  In manner, dress, look, and bearing, Wyngarde is presented  as a thoroughly - ah - masculine character.  Although the conflicts are a bit slow to develop, the story becomes really involving half way through - and it maintains the suspence until the terrific ending.",1035936000,3,870,5.299270072992701

1378041,5,B00004YRWY,"This is without a doubt one of the classiest and creepiest horror films I know of.  Based on Fritz Leiber's novel ""Conjure Wife"", it deals with modern day witchcraft and superstition. In an English hamlet, the American wife,Tansy (Janet Blair) of a university professor keeps voodoo talismans she acquired from a visit to the islands. She witnessed a shaman there perform magic and save her husband Norman's life. She never forgot it and procured the talismans from the shaman to protect her husband in the future. However, Norman (Peter Wyngarde) is a strict non-believer in the supernatural and when he finds the protection fetishes he burns them---much to Tansy's dismay. She becomes terrified that evil will now seek them out. Sure enough, one night something claws at their front door trying to get in. Then a female student suddenly accuses Norman of sexual misconduct and Tansy finds a voodoo doll hidden in a lamp after a card game with friends. Something bad is happening to them and Norman will not accept supernatural explanations. But he becomes increasingly uneasy as things continue to happen and when Tansy leaves to sacrifice herself to demonic forces in his place, he must confront his disbeliefs. Meanwhile, there is another faculty wife and fellow professor (Margaret Johnston) who has her own occult agenda for furthering the career of HER husband. Her role will come into play as Norman tries to save Tansy. I recommend this highly to anyone who hasn't seen it. Known in Britain as ""Night of the Eagle"", it at one time had a prologue spoken off screen by Orson Welles that was designed to crank up the audience to be scared silly. I love that print and wish the whole thing could make it on DVD. It's great in black & white, has excellent photography, beautiful direction by Sydney Hayers and an intelligent, literate script by Charles Beaumont and Richard Matheson. Excellent acting by the entire cast and a wonderful eerie atmosphere helps you understand Tansy's plight: her love for her husband, her strong desire to keep him safe even if it means resorting to the occult and feeling like an outsider being an American among the other British faculty wives. The supernatural is built up very well and keeps you edgy throughout. ""Burn Witch Burn"" rates classic status like ""Curse of the Demon""----it's that level of film horror. What scares us the most is what's unseen and clawing at the door, the phone ringing and no one is there when you answer, that strange feeling of unease and dread---all of these things are beautifully played out in b&w splendor. And then there's a WOW of a climax and ending. ""Burn Witch Burn"" really needs to be on DVD with that wonderful prologue by Welles. This is truly a ""lights out"" film. Simply fantastic.",1031875200,13,2763,4.853813559322034

The basic gimmick (a strictly rational scientist is forced to confront genuine supernatural happenings) is standard for the genre, but there are several interesting variations here.

The camera angles and use of shadows captures the viewers attention and enables the actors to get across that the situation is nerve racking to the characters in the play.
Some parts of the story remain unexplained which troubles me a bit because I like to have all the loose ends tied up.

I tracked this movie down because I saw a clip of it back in the 70's on ""That's Hollywood.""  In the clip a statue of an eagle comes to life and chases this guy around.  It was pretty cool, and still is.",1452470400,,469,4.344827586206897
