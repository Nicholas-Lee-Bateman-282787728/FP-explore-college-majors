8026649,5,B0002D68WY,"I was on the pistol team for Texas Dept. of Corrections in the 70s and have been doing my own trigger jobs since then.  Recently I bought a Model 27 classic that needed help desparately.  It has the wind up key action,  and while the single action was exceptional the double action should never have gone out the door of the factory.  Following Jerrys instruction this one is now a keeper,  instead of a gunshow trade item.  I learned a few things.  Thanks Jerry.",1380672000,2,463,4.440476190476191
