7868993,5,6304366140,"This is by far an unsung. Hero of children's songs, Woody Guthrie! The cartoon maker(name?) is also an unsung hero of amazing cartoons!!!!! Great for use in class for students of all ages! It's a work of art!",1407283200,,208,4.5
7868994,4,6304366140,"Excellent copies of wonderful documentaries. To see miners exiting the elevators covered in coal dust and obviously exhausted is very moving.hard work that this generation has never had to experience.
Highly recommended not just for the mining coverage but all the preparations for the coming world war 2 seem in retropspect rather inadequate until realising that was state of the art then..All the footage of the contribution of/by the women of Britain is incredible.",1387843200,,468,5.337837837837838

7868996,5,6304366140,"both of my sons loved this video
an animated music cartoon with no squeaky, whiny voices - just nice music and fun videos that moms and dad can actually enjoy - not just ""bear until they're over""",1244332800,,195,4.297297297297297
7868997,3,6304366140,"The music is great but the cartoons are stressful and violent in the old ""Tom and Jerry"" way. Too bad. This could have been much better.",1168992000,,136,4.269230769230769
7868998,5,6304366140,"I saw this video while subbing in a music class this year.  I am a long time study of Woody Guthrie, being a Okie folk singer from years ago.  I even held the 1st two Woody Festivals before the present ones held in Tecumseh.  I knew Marge and met Arlo.  As a presentation of Woody's Children's Songs this video is an excellent teaching tool to introduce children to a ""kid from Oklahoma"" and his wonderful songs for children.  He knew and loved kids, as he was one himself.  Puleez, when a child is 8, 9, 10 years old he doesn't need to bother with ""social issues"" except the pure enjoyment of singing - that was Woody's purpose for writing his kids' songs.  Also, Nora may have produced this video, but Arlo narrated it.  I knew I wanted the video as soon as I saw it as a teaching tool to kids who live in Oklahoma and a wonderful introduction to Oklahoma History.  Too many people try to intellectualize a gifted man who served his purpose on earth - to sing and make people happy.  He also had some issues - personal and social, but children love his songs anyway espcially ""This Land is Your Land"".  It is a joy to hear the giggles, squeals, and the singing along with this video.",1142035200,2,1185,4.316742081447964
7868999,5,6304366140,"I have a five year old that dressed up as Woody Guthrie for Halloween and one of the reasons was this delightful video.  Need I say more?  I will anyway.
This video was one of the things that helped my son begin appreciating music.  The animation is just ""not real"" enough so our boys could relax and enjoy the show without seeing real-life ""dinosaurs"" or whatever Disney wants to feed our children today. When you look at the options available in cartoons (let's differentiate cartoons from modern animation), i.e. Scooby Doo, etc, this stands head and shoulders above the competition.",993513600,4,586,4.84
