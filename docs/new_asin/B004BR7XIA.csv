8422295,5,B004BR7XIA,"Gintama is always hilarious, but some of the Gundamn jokes I still don't get having never seen that show. Gintama is one of the best parody show out there.. ranging from older titles like Lupin the third to Case closed to Yakitate Japan lol. If you don't mind spastic humor and ongoing jokes you will love Gintama.",1312243200,12,314,4.526315789473684
