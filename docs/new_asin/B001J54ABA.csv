8490612,5,B001J54ABA,"FULL DISCLOSURE: This review is written by the Director and is thus highly biased. That said, this super-special limited edition DVD of Hootenanny offers a rare glimpse into the making-of a no-budget indie film. This six-minute short was originally created for the 2008 48 Hour Film Project in Louisville, KY. It was written on a Friday night, shot on Saturday, and edited on Sunday. The submitted version was very rough; the version featured on this DVD is the 7th cut, completed weeks later. It includes more than 50 changes from the original version.

Along the way, our Electronic Press Crew shot more than 15 GIGS of behind-the-scenes footage. I carefully sifted through the drek and assembled over a dozen of the best clips to offer a glimpse into what goes into creating a film at a breakneck pace. SEE! the failed first footrace between Tyshaun and Rocko. HEAR! inexperienced actors complaining about the boredom associated with waiting for their scenes. EXPERIENCE! the comaraderie that grown among strangers as they briefly unite for a common cause.

Buried within the nearly incomprehensible menu are three versions of the film (Russel Willoughby's version originally submitted to the 48 Hour Film Project, Noor Nawabi's first version, and Noor's eventual Final Cut), storyboards, multiple photo galleries, script notes, original music, and original artwork. I'm not saying this DVD is a must-see, but if you're reading this far you'll probably like it. And all profits go toward future productions.

Hootenanny won Best Use of Genre at the 2008 Louisville 48 Hour Film Project. The assigned genre was ""Film de Femme"" (strong female lead).

Hootenanny was the final film to be produced under the Crazy Monkey moniker. I have since learned that a foreign film company is using the same name and, even though I believe I registered the name first, I decided to adopt a new name: Just in Time Films. Our third short has been completed and a fourth is in pre-production.

A warning to all Louisville 48 Hour teams: JiTF is winning Best Of Louisville next year. You're on notice.",1225065600,,2085,5.014450867052023
