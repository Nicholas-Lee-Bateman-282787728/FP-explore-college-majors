I can hardly wait to put it back in the DVD player!  Come on girls!  Let's shimmy!  Oh, it says it is for beginners, but even if you aren't a beginner, this one is fun, so if you need something fun to pop in just to get you moving, get this!",1307404800,3,374,3.6125
2269271,5,B00097C4AS,"Even if you are not a belly dance person and I'm not; you will love this dvd.  The music is great.  The moves are fantastic and you will sweat up a storm.  Seir did a wonderful job detailing the contents of the dvd, so I won't do that.  But I will tell you that I enjoyed it thoroughly.  If you don't have any belly dance experience, it may take a while to make your hips move in the right direction.  However, practice makes perfect!  Great job ladies!",1307318400,,453,4.137931034482759
2269272,5,B00097C4AS,"Sarah Skinner leads this vitalizing, energy charged, tremendous shimmy work out for beginners. In my opinion, definitely more than adequate for beginners and anyone seeking strengthening in shimmy technique, and a total body workout.  Aside from being an essential belly dance move, shimmies ease away tension and invigorate every part of the body-a huge physical benefit!
This is a complete workout, with a wonderful dance tutorial section. A perfect reference tool for beginners with detailed explanation of posture, layering, and each shimmy is broken down in simple explanations. Several bonuses of the workout is that each section ends with stretches, before embarking on the next chapter. I'm also a huge fan of the options for music only, or instructional voice over.

A description of the program:
Warm up-very adequate for the strength building section to follow. Toe raises,ankle rotations, upper and lower body isolations such as snake arms, hip circles, etc.

Strength building drills: Wow! This is intense! Shimmies layered on releve, hip slides, triple steps, lunges with level changes; wow, feel the burn! Some of the movement may be challenging for beginners but with consistency, this  series will pay off by strengthening the legs and hips for big luscious shimmies. After only several days, I can achieve this entire section.

The next chapters follow in increments of five minutes, ideal so that anyone on tight schedules can pick from six sections as a mini shimmy work out or combine the entire program for one hour of exercise:

Shimmy drill with hip slides and weight shift: Begin articulating the knees, hips from slow to fast pace using straight leg shimmies, and more.
 shimmy and Arabic hip walk shimmy: again, begin slow placed and up to tempo for a waist sculpting workout
Hip Twist,  hip pushes and shoulder shimmies, these are layered on releve, and traveling steps for entire body work out!
Choo- choo shimmy euphoria-.This is a high energy section with traveling shimmies on releve, flat feet with arm patterns. Definelty ankle and leg strengthening! A short interlude of hip circles allow a break from the intensity of traveling releve. The music by Naked Rhythm in this section becomes an energy boost.
Shimmy combinations drill: The segments are combined into a total drill for even more challenging workout. The music is not my favorite here, but my main focus was to complete the five minutes of drills!
A very thorough cool down: soft sways and undulations, full body stretches, cat cow series, spinal twists. Sarah's voice in the background in soft gentle tones was totally relaxing and there isn't much left but to melt into the yoga mat drenched in sweat!
What a fantastic workout! A must have!!!",1306886400,29,2739,5.098214285714286
2269273,5,B00097C4AS,"This is an awesome workout. I feel energized afterwards & Sarah Skinner does a great job breaking down proper form in the tutorial section. Which is awesome alone but the workout is so much fun & there is a nice stretch in between each shimmy section.

2269296,5,B00097C4AS,"This video is definitely not for beginners to belly dance - it has a lot of layering and more complicated moves like 3/4 shimmies.  That said, I absolutely LOVE this video.  I've been dancing for a while and use this between troupe practices.  It's broken into short segments that are fun and encouraging.  My favorite is the 5 minute shimmy part - it's excellent practice in both shimmy strength and layering fast and slow movements over shimmies.  I break a sweat every time I use it!  HIGHLY recommended!",1436313600,,507,4.704545454545454
2269297,5,B00097C4AS,"Wow! No trouble getting my heart rate up with this one!  Great workout, broken into manageable bites (so you can stretch and shimmy 3 - 6 times a day for ten minutes at a time, and log your 30 to 60 minutes -- a great help for mothers of small children.  Anyway, five minutes of sustained shimmy will probably be all you can manage at first. Whew. There are well-done tutorials as well, so it's not as if you're thrown into the deep end.

2269302,2,B00097C4AS,"I thought this was going to be a great workout, and as far as burning calories I'm sure it is. But that's if you can stick with it, without getting bored! That's my opinion, of course, but the problem is they repeat shimmying through the whole DVD. They do a little stretches for a warm up and cool down and the rest is shimmying...for 100 (long) minutes. They wear the long pants, as seen in the cover picture, so I wasn't able to see exactly how they were moving their legs--or even WHAT they were moving. But I guess without the flowing pants it would lose some of the entertainment factor. I've seen other belly dance workouts that I thought were more informative, lively and fun...and a real workout!",1422662400,,705,4.4728682170542635

2269314,5,B00097C4AS,"I've had this dvd one month, and I absolutely love it.  Brand new to belly dance.  I think anyone without any prior experience could learn to shimmy using this dvd.

Belly dance is much more complex and harder than it looks.

I find the 'choo-choo' shimmy hard to do, but I'm going to practice until I get it!  I'll give myself 6 months to really master this.

For me, the key is to let myself go and I can't!  I've spent my whole life trying to control myself, now in belly dance I have to let myself go?  Belly dance  seems to be a delicate balance of controlling separate areas of the body, while having fun at the same time.

So glad I bought this!",1415491200,2,652,4.144

2269334,3,B00097C4AS,It is broken up into sections and has stretching at the end of each section.  I didn't really like it.  I prefer it when the practises go nonstop for 1/2 hour or more so I can get fit as well.,1374537600,,192,3.775
2269335,5,B00097C4AS,"I was predisposed to like this workout because I already know that I enjoy various forms of dance cardio, and I further know that bellydance is my favorite kind of movement.  I needed a workout that would challenge my muscles physically, and I am at a point where I also want a workout that will challenge my skill level and make me a better dancer.  Do I think I will ever perform on stage?  Probably not, but I like bellydance enough to want to get better at it, and when I bought this DVD I wanted a skill challenge as well as a physical one.  I love it when the fitness instructor asks me to practice a difficult skill while I exercise. And this workout delivers.  I have plenty to work toward here.

I'm also really impressed by the format where we do five minutes of intense cardio and one or two minutes of stretching.  It reminded me a little of Shaun T's concept of reverse interval training, where he pushes his clients hard for a long period of time and then gives them a brief break to catch their breath.  I needed that little stretch break to calm down and recover a little when my muscles were so tired and I was pouring sweat.  I also thought it was a really good idea to use that break for flexibility training.  Lately I've been pausing my strength training workouts between sections and doing a couple of stretches to ease the muscles I just worked, and I think it works better for my body than waiting til the end and stretching everything at once.  So I think Sarah is onto something here. And I'm choosing this over Insanity because I really enjoy the movements of bellydance, whereas Insanity just feels like middle school gym class.

Also, this workout is just bursting with joy and exuberance.  I've done lots of bellydance workout DVDs and there are many that I really like, and bellydance is just fun and bouncy anyway.  But this one is especially fun.  It feels like play time. It distracts me into not realizing I'm working out, and that's something I really appreciate.

The last thing I really love about this DVD is that it's long.  I know the length may not work for everyone, but it's divided into sections so you can stop where you like and cool down.  I'm working on a goal of doing one hour of cardio per day, and this DVD allows me to do that without switching discs or coming up with my own freestyle moves.  I can just follow along, and I get my workout.

So I'm really excited to add this DVD to my workout rotation.  It's flirty, fun, empowering, and challenging.  I sweated a river.  I would recommend it to advanced beginners or intermediate students of bellydance who want to shake their booties and raise their skill level.",1367107200,4,2669,4.435318275154004
2269336,4,B00097C4AS,"This DVD truly is a *shimmy* workout as stated.  Lots of isolations, tons of shimmies.  Pretty much every move is a shimmy.  I found it quite a challenge, never having done any type of bellydance before.  I got it for my abs, but my legs and arms got more of a workout, as several exercises have the arms held out to the sides.  The exercises are in short segments, maybe 10 or 15 min.

I did expect more choreography throughout the routine, but overall it was fun and fresh.  Love the music and instruction.",1367020800,,508,4.340425531914893
2269337,4,B00097C4AS,"I think my expectations were a bit more but I should have realized the focus was  mostly on the shimmies. Perhaps some additional choreography, moves could have been incorporated with the shimmies thrown it.  But for anyone who wants to practice their shimmies, this is a great instructional DVD.",1364860800,,296,5.020408163265306
2269338,2,B00097C4AS,I have been doing belly dancing for aprox a year and also doing several tapes I was so disappointed in this videa as it is NOT for beginners. the prompts and the skills are not at all for beginners all i can say is money wasted and frustration is all i got from this video,1361491200,3,272,3.963636363636364
2269339,5,B00097C4AS,I am new to bellydanding.  I am in my 40's and had belly-dancing on my bucket list.  I had a hard time learning how to shimmy in the class.  The cd helped me tremendously. I was able to practice at home and learned the steps better than I did in the class. Now I can shimmy.,1351468800,4,274,3.857142857142857
2269340,4,B00097C4AS,"Unlike the population most belly dance or exercise DVDs are usually meant for, I'm 53, I live on a fixed income, and I have the requisite physical issues that come with aging, so I'm not going to make my knees and back do things that will make them scream at me later. I adapt.

Anyhow, I started belly dancing from DVDs several years ago, with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Luscious-The-Bellydance-Workout-for-Beginners/dp/B0015FJYV0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Luscious - The Bellydance Workout for Beginners</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-Potion-The-Bellydance-Workout/dp/B001TZ70DU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love Potion - The Bellydance Workout</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hard-Candy-The-Bellydance-Workout/dp/B002L6SL8O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hard Candy - The Bellydance Workout</a>.

After&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hard-Candy-The-Bellydance-Workout/dp/B002L6SL8O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hard Candy - The Bellydance Workout</a>, I purchased Irina's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bellydance-Tribal-Fusion-Workout/dp/B00095MBQ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bellydance Tribal Fusion Workout</a>&nbsp;DVD.  I have others in my collection as well, but my experience with these form the basis of my comments. If I hadn't gotten these DVDs down pat for the most part--and that took a really long time, by the way--there's no way I'd be able to follow Sarah's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bellydance-Shimmy-Workout/dp/B00097C4AS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bellydance Shimmy Workout</a>.

I agree with the commenter who mentioned that the tutorial on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bellydance-Shimmy-Workout/dp/B00097C4AS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bellydance Shimmy Workout</a>&nbsp;rather abbreviated. And the DVD is not for absolute beginners. If I'd started with this workout, I would have given up because I wouldn't have any understanding or ability to follow what Sarah's talking about. If you have worked with other DVDs before, if you can keep up, and you understand the basics, you'll be OK.  Otherwise, you may find yourself without a clue. I'm just sayin.'

That said, I would have appreciated a little more instruction during the tutorial. For instance, I don't really understand the shimmy that makes your belly button move around. I saw it with my own eyes, but I'm not sure how it does that even with a deep-kneed, juicy shimmy, so I don't know how I'm going to make mine move that way. I'll keep trying, but I may have to peek at a message board to find out.

If I had a wish list for this DVD: I also would like a practice flow to go with the tutorial. I find practice flows get me used to the movements I'll be using; and once I get the movements down, if I want to add the entire flow to the workout, I can. After all, it's just more exercise. ;-) Using the practice flow also can keep a girl honest if her movements get sloppy or her muscles memory takes a holiday.  Moreover, a practice flow would have come in handy when I'm doing the 3/4 shimmy walk and need to make a turn. I'd like a little tidbit showing how it's done most effectively. I'd like to know if it's simply a pivot, a cross step (at which point I'd trip and fall), or what. I'd also like titles telling me what I'm doing, and more left and right directions. I will memorize the darn thing, but it's nice to know what's coming up. I love Sarah's costuming. She does a wonderful job designing and sewing, so the outfits are a joy to look at. Nonetheless, I couldn't see the dancers' feet or leg movements, so at times I found it difficult to follow the steps.

For all that, I do like the workout section. I was able to get through most of the workout on my first try, which surprised me. My legs wanted to die during one section, the choo-choo shimmies, as I'm not used to sustained shimmies with releves. For beginners, or uncoordinated sorts like me, I would suggest not doing the arm patterns or travel steps until mastering the shimmies themselves. You'll still get the workout, but you can build it from the foundation and go from there.

I realize it probably seems as if I'm moaning and groaning and complaining, but look at all those stars I gave this DVD! I rarely give full points so even though my wish list is fairly long and nitpicky, you can tell how I think the DVD's quality is stellar. I would definitely recommend it to people who have mastered the basics and have started layering.",1350518400,14,5263,6.130257801899593
2269341,4,B00097C4AS,"So I'm beginning to think that the label ""for beginners"" means different things for different companies. I've found that for World Dance New York, their ""beginner"" is an intermediate to advanced beginner in reality depending on their dance background.

 I would like to think that I'm in this category because I understood what was going on during the DVD. I will qualify this for others that while Sarah Skinner is a wonderful dancer she does not break down the moves like you probably hoped she would. I've been struggling with my shimmies since I first began to belly dance and I thought ""Hey for a DVD that deals in shimmies they have to break it down in one way or another right?"" Wrong, she does a quick brief one over of the shimmy and kind of leaves it for you to practice independently. Due to this fact it makes this DVD an extremely hard workout for me because I can only maintain shimmies for a short period of time.

  This DVD also runs into one of my new found personal pet peeves, instructors wearing the loose style exercise pants while instructing dance. I could barely see her knees while she was doing the instruction due to the wardrobe she or WDNY selected for her and I'm finding this is a major issue with most of their DVDs. She does wear slightly better pants during the tutorial, but there is a giant hip scarf to block your view most of the time, but she will move it.

 On the other side this is a really wonderful DVD for people who want to practice their shimmies and get a workout while doing it. I enjoy listening to her talk, which I find extremely important in an instructional DVD if you hate your ""teachers"" voice how could you listen to them? She makes sure you get a good warm up before you even begin this routine which is always important, she is very encouraging during the video, and you will get stronger shimmies.

So summary, it is for people who already understand and know how to shimmy and will make your shimmies stronger and just help your belly dance technique.",1349913600,9,2013,4.4659400544959125

There is a tutorial that covers the different shimmies and steps used in this video, I reviewed them all, but only needed clarification on a couple items, and found it there. It is not the DVD you want if you are looking for help with learning shimmies or to learn new shimmy variations, it is a workout!

Sarah Skinner is fun and never annoying and the dancers she has assisting her are very skilled as well. It is impressive to watch how precise they all are with their shimmies.  It took me a few times to be able to get my way through the entire DVD and I certainly can feel the workout.  I also like that I can choose a few sections and make my own workout if I don't have time for the entire tape. Super fun and challenging!,1329436800,3,539,4.009345794392523

It's not one of those DVDs (and there are many) that look so good on the outside and then when you get to the workout it's totally different. The costumes are actually the same as on the cover and the performers exactly as pictured doing exactly what's promised: shimmies. The whole thing's choreographed well, with the instructor and performers wearing matching outfits. Between the five-minute shimmy segments are little stretch workouts. While it's true that beginners wouldn't be able to follow the workout immediately unless they had a knack for copying the moves without any real explanation of technique, there is a whole section of the DVD for tutorials that someone can go through before starting.

This is the reason that I didn't give a full five stars and it may not even be Sarah's fault but rather the production company that labelled the video.

Sarah is interesting.  She walks the line of being overly cutesy (and steps over it on a couple of occasions) but the video is so thorough and fantastic that it makes putting up with the perkiness more than worthwhile.",1322092800,5,531,4.739130434782608
2269351,5,B00097C4AS,"I so love love love this dvd. Why? it always cheers me up. if you are ever feeling down, I highly recommend: shimmy. just the shaking and the wiggling puts me in a good mood. Sarah is so cheerful. I love her encouraging comments. At first I was a little intimidated by their outfits. I call this dvd the 3 sphinxes, cause that's how their costumes make them look. but, after you get past that, she is really just down to earth. Neon is the same way. at first, i am like, aren't you gals just a little overdressed for a simple workout class inside my tv? Sarah has a great workout on this dvd, i esp. love that in between every shimmy chapter she has a slow stretch. that is great. Also, she has teaching on this tape, too. it's a completely different section and I accidentally found it. i didn't know it was there at first, but every move on here she does teach. I give this dvd A+ I,m embarrassed to say how many dance dvds I have. Like with most of the belly dance tapes, You get WAY MORE than your money's worth here.",1318204800,,1021,4.161616161616162
2269352,5,B00097C4AS,"First off, this is NOT an instructional DVD.  It is what it claims to be, a shimmy workout.  The tutorial is helpful but brief (watch, Pause, drill, repeat, if you need to) compared to instructional DVDs (Jenna & Leila both have excellent beginner programs.)  I'm a beginning dancer and I LOVE practicing to this one.  I can't keep up with much of it, but I have a blast trying.  I find Sarah to be very pleasant, the music is motivational and in just a few weeks I can tell I'm improving.",1315267200,5,489,4.329670329670329
2269353,5,B00097C4AS,"Words cannot describe how much I love this latest release from WDNY.  Sarah Skinner was always one of my favorite instructors in their past workout videos.  In ""The Shimmies Workout"", she takes center stage, leading an invigorating workout in her specialty - shimmies.  Of course, it's nothing unique - Aziza has had a 20-minute shimmy drill on her practice DVD for years.  Many people, like myself, need the kick-in-the-pants of a new DVD to get ourselves going again.  I have been recommending this one to my friends.

What's different about this shimmy drill DVD?  First, it is conveniently split into 5 short sections, acompanied by stretches, making it easy to customize yoru workout.  Sarah says that shimmies  must be practiced daily to keep them strong.  In the past week, I have used 2-3 sections of this workout per day.  As a busy working mom, I no longer have time to spend the hours I used to in the dance studio.  Now I can kick off my practice time with some shimmies.

This DVD also features a variety of shimmies.  The main course is the hip shimmy, the one seen most often in American Nightclub style - layered on slides and figure 8s and done straight out. Sprinkled in is the Egyptian knee shimmy, shoulder shimmies, and twist shimmies.  For variety, hip bumps and twists flat-footed and on releve make an appearance.  Three-quarter shimmies and Hagallah shimmies are also drilled.  Then there is a whole section on choo-choo shimmies.  The final drill combines all the moves in one really fun sequence, set to music that evokes Taiko drums.  I normally excel at the Egyptian knee shimmy, so I like the fact that this video pushes me out of my comfort zone and makes me work on this big hip shimmies.  I can feel my muscles working hard and I am already seeing a difference in the power of my shimmies.

Moreover, it's fun.  Sarah's cues remind you to keep it big and juicy, to let those hips fly.

If I could suggest an improvement for future DVDs, it would be to take a cue from Shiva Rea's yoga matrix and allow the DVD user to construct a customized shimmy workout, to put the segments together in the order of their choosing.  You can, of course, use the chapter menu to do this but then you have to take a break between each section to arrange it.",1314921600,4,2273,4.555555555555555
2269358,5,B00097C4AS,"Wow, this video is awesome. If you want to firm your tummy, butt and thighs this is the video for  you. I want to lose weight as well and I know this awesome video will help me. Easy to do and music is amazing. Thank you.",1312761600,,221,3.8043478260869565
2269359,5,B00097C4AS,"I remember when I was learning to type, oh so long ago, I was using a software tutorial that encouraged users to spend just five to ten minutes a day on typing with the correct fingers. Apparently, that's all it would take. They must have been right because pretty soon I found myself touch-typing at high speed. I manage to unnerve a lot of people by talking to them while my fingers are flying on the keyboard.

I suspect it'll be much the same for learning shimmies. If you want to get them into your muscle memory, spending five minutes on shimmying is a great idea. Just add it to your regular practice. Sarah Skinner's new DVD is based on this thought. It's also built on the idea that shimmying always brings a smile to your face - and your audiences' for that matter - and that it's a joyful activity. So, better than over-working it or obsessing over the nuances of technique, make the practice or drilling fun.

The heart of this DVD is in the six five-minute shimmy sessions. There's a very nice (shortish but varied and full-body) warm-up, and a cool down. There's also some stretches and strength exercises for a minute or so before each shimmy workout-let. Obviously, because it's designed to let you pick up any individual session to work with. Or play with, I should say.

Each session starts straight off and picks up pace. I must describe a session in some detail here. It isn't just plain ole shimmies you do here. There's a lot happening and it changes from one moment to the next. In fact, I don't know what dancers will do with the only-music option because I can't handle that. I'll go for the cued sessions any day. You can also access each session separately in its own chapter. So anyway, I did the Egyptian shimmy session today. The moment you get with it, you have to change something: switch between singles and full-time, layer it on a simple horizontal eight, alternate with a `big-knee' shimmy, weight shift, one-leg shimmy, layer arm patterns, etc. And DOES put a smile on your face - straight off. I haven't done the full lot yet, but totally enjoyed the workouts I've done so far. Strangely, I also found I could do some of the layering that I otherwise agonize over.

Through the session, you get egged on by Sarah - and that's really important. I think this will be even more fun for a group to do together. Like they are in the video.

If you want a huge workout, do the whole lot together. Thirty minutes of non-stop shimmy. She takes up all the basic variations: regular, choo-choo, , shimmy, Arabic hipwalk etc. No terribly fancy or unusual ones.

There's a separate tutorial section, but really, it's not the place for anyone to learn these from scratch. Not if you want to learn them very seriously. Understand the movements elsewhere, and review them here. Even so these short 30-second lessons squeeze in some good tips. They're meant more for users to identify exactly what is being done in the workout and follow along.

So again - not the video to learn shimmies with, but an aid to practice and workout with. In that sense, it's not a critical addition to your collection, but it's a nice-to-have, specially as it is likely to be used quite often.

This is a simple not-very-long video (100 minutes) with not even the usual performance included. I'm used to seeing videos that are over 200 minutes long from WDNY, but then, how much shimmy can you do. Also, those cost more.

Overall, I feel the strengths of this video are:
<ol>
 <li>Breaking things up into short richly varied sessions</li>
 <li>Keeping it moving, fun and invigorating right through</li>
 <li>Sticking to simpler shimmies while still doing basic layering</li>
</ol>
I also think it's a good idea to separate the tutorials from the workouts. I've just been exploring another video (on drilling hip work) which has about 8 minutes of talking to 2 minutes of drilling. It's truly annoying, considering you want to use the video repeatedly and can't very well stand there listening to lengthy explanations each time - including why she will now show you the move from the back view. But that's another story.

A small disclaimer. You'll see my name in the credits. Yes, indeed! I'm thrilled. But my inputs on music have been very minimal and Sarah is a generous and sweet person by the looks of it!",1312588800,2,4312,4.6356487549148095

2269361,5,B00097C4AS,"This is a great dvd and priced right on Amazon.  I bought this dvd to help me with my shimmies and just from practicing once a week for about 5 weeks I can already see improvement.  Although the title reads ""Beginner"" it is not necessarily a beginner workout and some formal class room instruction is helpful.  There is not much time spent on explanations and it does go from slow to fast fairly quickly. However, not only do you get several shimmy variations, but Sarah also provides arms and layering; a bonus.  I find this to be a valuable dvd in my library and I appreciate the broken down sections for time management.  The costumes are beautiful and not overstated.  I wish there was a performance by Sarah though, as the World Dance New York videos I already own include them.  But it's not worth reducing the star rating for that.  World Dance New York has a great instructional line of videos and I have not been disappointed yet. I was so impressed with the Shimmy DVD, I ordered Sarah Skinner's Veil instruction.

2269363,5,B00097C4AS,"This is one of my favorite DVD's because in addition of getting a work out I get the opportunity to practice, and improve my shimmies.  In one of Sadie's DVD's she mentioned how important it is for dancers to have strong legs and this work out reminded me of her advise.  The DVD is divided in sections that are just the right lenght, and provide enough variety to prevent excessive fatigue or bordom.  It also includes a brief stretching segment in between the sections.  The stretching segment is an excellent fitness method to gain flexibility, strenght and stamina.  I own other shimmie DVD's, and consider them a waste of money.  This one is not.  The DVD would have been better if the choice of music was more dynamic and the instructor used a mirror.  In my opinion, neither of the cons mentioned are so detrimental that it detracts from the work out.  I am noticing that a few Belly Dance instructional or work out DVD's selection of music is horrible (for this DVD is tolerable, and I think I am starting to like it or get the beat).  Like I said even so this is one of my favorite DVD's.",1310515200,,1097,4.44

I feel positive and energized from doing this and Sarahs gentle and open demeanour makes it more enjoyable and doable. I am one who gets bored easily if I am not challenged. This dvd is well structured and helps me to strengthen and improve my shimmies which were never a strong point for me. All in all I enjoyed this greatly and will recommend it to my students. I love my bellydance and I am on a lower income level so i appreciate the need to know what to invest in and I am truly glad I bought this and highly recommend it.

2269366,2,B00097C4AS,"I have been dancing for 1.5yrs now and struggle with shimmies, accordingly I was looking forward to a DVD to help me out.  I have Sarah's veil DVD, and whilst I haven't worked through it thoroughly I was impressed enough to buy the Shimmy one. I am really disappointed with it - regrettfully!

It is excellent quality, Sarah is lovely to learn from and watch, the chapters etc. are great for navigation but the content is NOT for BEGINNERs!!!!

Sarah gives a quick and I mean quick overview on technique for the moves which if you are a beginner you would be struggling quite frankly. Then the first drill on shimmies has layering shimmies over figure 8's (and others) and moving arms quite a bit.  Now this is my big bug bear.

She doesn't teach layering (she mentions it, but no instruction) and layering over those moves is NOT BEGINNER.

So instead of feeling encouraged with some good basic shimmy breakdown and drills I am left discouraged and will put the lovely DVD away for a year till I find something to get me up to that level!!!!

If you are clever and can do shimmy layering already then this is an excellent resource but if you are a beginner so far as shimmies then this will probably be too hard ......

If anyone can recommend a DVD for me then that would be great!",1308700800,49,1283,4.4297872340425535
2269367,5,B00097C4AS,"The Bellydance Shimmy Workout is World Dance New York's latest offering in their popular workout series. For those of you who are counting, there are now five DVDs (six if you count Rhythms which is a little bit of a different format), each of which feature the WDNY staples - Neon, Blanca, Sarah Skinner, or Tanna Valentine. Shimmy, like the other workout DVDs, is marketed as a DVD that's intended for beginners and is hosted by Sarah Skinner.

Unlike the Cocktail DVD, this one has the pieces of the workout separated out allowing you to watch each in shorter drill sections. This is a nice touch, as it means that you can select from warmup, strength building, and other shimmy drills in order to do a shorter workout if you are not up for the entire full hour long shimmy bonanza. This is something that's especially beneficial to dancers who may not yet have the stamina for Sarah's lengthy shimmy drills - while they may not be particularly technically challenging for a more advanced dancer they were definitely a test for endurance if you decide to shimmy for the long haul. You can also choose to watch the different sections all together in one long flow session with, or without, Sarah's verbal cues. I will again give WDNY kudos for this setup as I think it's a most excellent way for dancers to learn by following along and also better understand, when only using the musical section, how the movements can effectively match up with the music. Also like the other WDNY workout DVDs, there's an entire section of technique tutorial to help you better understand how to execute each movement. The movements featured in this section of the DVD include:
  * bent knee shimmy
  * big knee shimmy
  * sustained shimmy
  * straight leg shimy
  * hip hits
  * hip twists
  * 3/4 shimmy
  * arabic hip walk (a variation of 3/4 shimmy on the down)
  * choo choos
  * cutesy butt choo choo
  * shoulder shimmies
  * shimmy layering
  * releve and posture
For the beginning/intermediate dancer, this is a nice variety of shimmies and I was pretty surprised to see Sarah covered so many movements. Don't expect a lengthy drill session for each move though; this is, after all, intended to be only a brief introduction to help you better understand the move (the drilling comes in the shimmy drill sections where, instead of simply drilling each move, you will actually dance them!). Even so, Sarah gives a clear description of each movement, describing the body mechanics so that even those who have never danced before will be able to follow. I particularly appreciated the fact that her costuming here so nicely displays the movements - she is in a dark color on a very light background with no flowing skirts or pants to hide her feet or legs making it very easy to study the mechanics of each move. You definitely won't get frustrated here trying to figure out what on earth she is doing.

I've got to give Sarah credit - she dances through the entire DVD. From the very beginning of the warmup to the end of the cool down she fluidly moves her body and dances. I found myself thinking, geez, she really stretches out her neck quite prettily with a nice arm flourish and hand movements - a silly thought but, hey, when you see it you'll understand what I'm talking about. She brings grace to the entire process of her movement, not just the drills or the dancing, which can really benefit your muscle memory. If you can follow her method of using every opportunity to dance - not just the time when you're ""supposed"" to in the DVD - you will begin to discover that no movement is wasted and that each little gesture becomes a lyrical expression.

I know, it sounds cheesy, but I was pretty impressed by how she and her two dancing companions made the warmups (and the cool down too) themselves look like their own dance. And, you can imagine, that this carries into the drills and the entirety of the workout too. Additionally, Sarah gives fantastic stage face - her enthusiasm is catching and I found I couldn't help but smile right along with her. My calves and thighs may have ached during the hour long shimmyfest, but I was grinning the whole time!

Now, I also have to tell you just how much I loved Sarah's drills. I'm a drill nerd, and so I was in heaven with this section. The workout, if you do it in its entirety, is made up of these little drill sections with stretching and other movements in between. But if you are curious about just working on a drill or two Sarah's got you covered - because you're not just going to be dancing ""shimmy drill 1"" or ""shimmy drill 2."" OH NO. What you'll discover is that Sarah's carefully planned out her shimmy drills to focus on specific technique and or movements. So, ok, sure drills usually do that. But what I liked about her drills was the combination of the movements along with dancing elements such as transitions, weight shifts, level changes, and layering. These are pieces of bellydance that we don't always consciously focus upon and it was great to see them included here (for a description of the drill sections, check out Seir's excellent reivew).

I've seen a lot of shimmy-themed DVDs out there - there are definitely some that have really cute combos and very technically advanced shimmies. But what I really liked about this one was, much like many of the WDNY offerings, it has so much to offer. Once again, this is an excellent value - what you get is definitely worth what you pay for, if not more, in this little gem. In one DVD you get not just a workout but also themed drills, the breakdown of all of the different movements, and the opportunity to actually dance through the workout rather than just follow along. And, again, this one is just a fun one - I kept going back to it again and again on my day off, reluctant to leave the fun. Other reviewers are saying they finished it feeling energized and I had the same experience too; it left me giddy and excited to keep right on dancing. While the drills gave me technique practice the workout gave me dance practice - I'm definitely happy this one is now in my collection!

You will like this DVD if:
* You would like creative new ways to build strength and technique for even, clean shimmies.
* In particular, you are a beginning or early intermediate level dancer who would like to improve your shimmy technique while incorporating it into dancing and/or would like to work on shimmy layering.
* You would like to work on strength building techniques that incorporate shimmies (this was a really nice touch - my favorite part!) to improve your level change abilities.
* You are interested in learning how to do a variety of new shimmies and shimmy-based movements.
* You would like a workout that is moderate to challenging that is bellydance-based and includes tons of shimmying.
* You are looking for a REALLY fun workout!

What might not work for you:
* I've heard some complaints from dancers if the music featured in a workout bellydance DVD is not primarily bellydance music. This one uses a variety of music, some that sounds more ambient and other songs that are classical drum solo pieces. There's even one song by Solace off of an album they did that has a distinct Asian flair. This could work for you, if you really like to be exposed to different types of music to see how bellydance can work with it, or against if you prefer just dancing to more classical pieces.
* (Ok this is the obvious one) you'd like an offering that includes more than just shimmies - for that you might want to check out the WDNY Hard Candy workout DVD.
* There are no performances on this DVD. I was hoping for one or two, after Cocktail, but really this DVD is so awesome I can't whine too much about not getting to see Sarah and her dancers shake it.",1308009600,29,7779,4.537526804860614

It amazes me how quickly you begin to feel the difference in the way your body moves naturally! Even something as simple as walking feels completely different! It's as though I can feel the bones and muscles in my hips glide smoothly into place. It's definitely a workout, and because you are learning to use new movements, it takes time to keep up. If you do the things you can, and follow the routine daily,  you will love seeing the changes it makes! Besides,  who doesn't want sexy bellydancing moves on their can-do list?

8058017,3,B00097C4AS,"This DVD is exactly what it claims to be: a shimmy workout or better said, a shimmy bootcamp, meaning that you do a lot of reps of a very few basic moves (like in a regular fitness workout), so it is probably very good to build up your shimmies. Do not expect interesting combinations or sophisticated layering; I was a bit disappointed, specially after the shimmy section guided by Sarah Skinner in the Love Potion DVD, which is somehow more fun to perform. Here you will basically practise your Egyptian shimmy, bent leg shimmy,  shimmy (up & down), chest shimmy, twist shimmy and choo-choo, with some layering of travel steps, chest accents, hip circles & horizontal figure eights. There is no much variation of the moves, it is rather the same move repeated until you get tired. Although I need to say that you do not get bored like in a regular workout, there is still the dancing element that helps me through the reps. Maybe this is the way to help you master the shimmies and get them controlled and going I will probably be more able to tell you this after some more using it. It is definitely not for absolute beginners, you need to know the basic bellydance moves, but I think it is doable by more advanced beginners (ignoring the layered moves which are not too many, and concentrating on the shimmies).

CARDIO CHALLENGE: Medium to high TONING: Medium to high CHOREOGRAPHY DIFFICULTY: Beginner to Intermediate INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY: Very Good MUSIC: Very Good FUN FACTOR: Good

CONTENTS:
1) WARM UP & CONDITIONING - Excellent segment to warm you up and get some muscles working
2) 5 SHIMMY SEGMENTS - with an approximate length of 5 minutes each, in which a particular type of shimmy is drilled. The last segment combines all different types of shimmies.
3) STRETCHING between each segment. The stretching is very brief (one stretch) but well designed to relax some muscles and move on to the next segment.
4) COOL DOWN - includes very nice dancing sways and some stretching exercises.
5) TUTORIAL  This is a very basic tutorial or more precisely a very brief explanation of each shimmy type and how to perform it, there is no drilling time included in the tutorial.

MUSIC:
There are different types of instrumental music in the selection (no lyrics), I think some are Classic Arabic music and others are more modern, no idea what type it is. It is nice to accompany the shimmies.

EMPHASIS:
The emphasis is on drilling the basic shimmy types over and over.

WHAT IS BETTER THAN IN OTHER DVD'S:
+ Its a no-nonsense workout. You start drilling the shimmies right away.
+ It is very specific. It contains shimmy drills and thats it.
+ It gets your heart rate up, probably more cardio exercise than other bellydance workouts
+ The warm up and conditioning, as well as the stretching routines are very well designed and very targeted at specific muscle groups to help your shimmies. Other conditioning segments that I have seen are more total body, for example they include back and abs strengthening exercises for backbends, etc., this one is for leg strengthening only, but it is so detailed as to also strengthen your ankles and calves.",1486684800,,3149,4.735401459854015
