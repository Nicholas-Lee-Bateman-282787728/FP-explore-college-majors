3039376,5,B000ZECQ08,"I also hope this movie doesn't leave out so many of the exciting events from the book.
I feel sorry for people who don't understand what fantasy fiction is - it's not real and it doesn't cause people to become oppressed by demons.  I wonder if ""Sam"" has even read a Harry Potter book. Probably too afraid.  If you read these books you see themes of friendship, loyalty, honesty, compassion for others, persisting against obstacles, standing up for what is right & good, fighting evil, sacrificing self for others, so many admirable themes I can't even list them all.  It's sad that some people only judge a book ""by the cover"". I am a Christian my entire life and I don't believe these books corrupt anyone.  You are corrupted by what is inside you, Sam, in your heart.",1227571200,17,769,4.550724637681159
3039377,5,B000ZECQ08,"Let's face it. The Order of the Phoenix movie left out a ton of good stuff. I just hope they do a lot better with this one. It is my favorite book of the series and would hate to see it messed up on the big screen, especially the ending. Judging from the teaser trailer and pictures that have been released, it looks like a great movie. I'll be counting down the days until July 17.",1222214400,8,382,4.0394736842105265
3039378,3,B000ZECQ08,"""The Half Blood Prince"" should be called ""The Half Cocked Film."" Books aside, the film leaps, jumps and bounces about from darkness to glee in artistic, engaging and dramatically potent form, but in the end may leave the viewer scratching their heads.

Fans of the books KNOW what's going on, moviegoers may be a bit confused as the why things happen. For one, the film opens with Ginny and Harry madly in unspoken love as Ginny snogs Dean Thomas anyway, and Hermione is suddenly infatuated with Ron - sure, there has been tension between hem since puberty, but jealousy seems a bit of a stretch all of a sudden (in the books it's more of a slow brewing issue.)

Without too many spoilers, ask yourself: how and why does Harry know what and for what use a Beazor is and why does his potions master (not Snape now) sit and watch a student die when the solution should be clear to him? Why is there no defenses at the Weasely house if they are in dire danger, why no Order members standing guard, no spells around the property and why do the Death Eaters attack? (hint, it's not in the book at all!!! so there's no answer.) Why does Dumbledore take Harry to the Burrow at the beginning of the film (it makes sense in the book, here, no reason.) Why does Harry take orders from Snape at the end without question? Why does no one challenge four Death Eaters running amok in Hogwarts and setting Hagrid's hut ablaze?

The movie is fast, humorous, entertaining and a wonder to watch, both emotionally and visually. I buy the characters, the motivations, the special effects, everything almost... just not the logical flaws that made me scratch my head all the way home.

 I do hope they shot a lot of scenes that will someday make up an extended DVD /  Blu-Ray version. The film is so close to being the perfect Potter film, but forgets the audience isn't stupid.",1218844800,15,1857,4.4955489614243325

3039404,4,B000ZECQ08,"Superb.

There is a saying,""It's always darkest before the dawn."" In this case the darkness is about to fall. Harry Potter in the last film has incurred a great triumph but at the same time a terrible loss. The wizarding world is no longer living in denial that Lord Voldemort has returned. Voldemort has been denied the knowledge of his prophesied demise and many of his loyal subjects are imprisoned. Harry however has lost family, incurred great pain and now faces the future with more uncertainty.

But life goes on and Harry is reunited with friends and with his cherished life at Hogwarts as Professor Dumbledore begins to teach Harry in something far more vital that schoolwork - the demise of Voldemort. Memories into Dumbledore and Voldemort's past are leading to a secret truth that Harry must find from a brand new professor. All the while various occurrences caused by Voldemort's Death Eaters as well as a mysterious plot that Harry suspects from old rivalries may actually be more than he thinks.

The movie ends with truths revealed as well as terrible tragedies. Still, its a great story, leading up to the final chapters in the Harry Potter saga. I also particularly enjoy stories that reveal more about the villain. I definitely enjoy the Voldemort flashbacks. Though much was missing from the books that could have made it even better.

This movie was great on Blu-Ray and I'm glad I purchased it in time before Warner Bros. stopped giving away its free iTunes Digital Copy. B+",1517529600,,1496,4.83203125

Of all the Harry Potter movies I've watched thus far, I've enjoyed this the most.  It's a dark - physically and mentally - movie.  (Be sure to turn off extraneous lighting while watching so you can see what's happening in some scenes.)

Harry discovers a spell book previously owned by ""Half-Blood Prince"".  We find out later who that is be a confession.  This book has ""updated"" spells with notes in the margins.  We find out a few new relationships between ""You-Know-Who"" and other characters in the series.  This isn't your feel-good movie.  This delves deeply into the mythology of the series.  It can be a tad dry in places, but it's well worth following through.",1488758400,,926,6.108527131782946

3039539,5,B000ZECQ08,"""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" is the set-up to the ""Deathly Hallows"", the two-part finale of the series.  Lord Voldemort and his minions are slowly closing the ring on Harry and his friends and allies.  Even Hogwarts is no longer safe, as it becomes clear there are traitors within the walls.  Harry and Professor Dumbledore will follow a string of clues in the hunt for an ancient memory that may represent Voldemort's vulnerability.  That trail takes Harry and his allies into some very dark country; not all will survive the journey.  And who is the Half-Blood Prince?

The darkness in this movie is delightfully relieved by the happy fact that our favorite Hogwarts students are now teenagers, and in the full throes of the normal hormonal storm.  Friendships will be tested and new relationships formed.  The odd but goodhearted Luna Lovegood will be a friend in need to Harry.  Ron Weasley's younger sister Ginny comes into her own as a witch and as an ally of the trio.  Ron Weasley will discover the dangers of mixing magic and romance.  Hermione will learn to share what she holds most dear, in unexpected ways.

The special effects and the pacing of the movie are excellent.  The location shooting in Scotland is almost distractingly good.  A stream of good actors continue to fill up the screen with good performances.  Very highly recommended to fans of the series.",1485820800,,1388,4.846808510638298

One thing about this movie, you really need the backstory of the previous movies to really grasp plot of this one.

This is one movie that does not stand well on it's own if you have no backstory that you're aware of.

They really don't develop her character well in the films she is such a better character in the books. Leaving out who Voldemort's mother is and the significance of the ring which is more of an issue for the next films but I will cross that bridge later.. And lastly the werewolf guy they don't give any info on him at all and what happened to the order fighting at the school at the end.

Ok, I know it is a play and written that way, but I still was left wanting more detail and in-depth character development.  This book actually could have been two books (maybe more).  The story was too much like a sitcom (you've got  24 minutes to set the story and come to a conclusion); neat and clean and the conclusion seemed forced like they had to finish it to meet a time frame.  (Yea, I know, it's a play stupid, they do have a set time frame to fit it in).  Harry and the rest are like family and the introduction to their children was just too brief.  Like going to a family reunion and only being able to meet the new members of the family for  5 minutes and then having to leave.
Can't wait to compare the actual play to the book though.

I had the first five movies but had only rented the last three.  I have purchased them all for my collection.  As in all series movies or books, the early ones when the stars are young and the theme is just beginning are always the best but the dynamic threesome of Harry, Ron, and Hermione don't disappoint.  And, the cast of professors, just get better and better.  Think of Professor Snapes!",1467590400,,530,4.46875

In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!  This is fraud.  This is likely also a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and just bad business!!!!!!

3039844,2,B000ZECQ08,"An acceptable ""bridge"" episode (you know this is primarily serving to bridge to the climactic final film) but ultimately it was just pretty dull.  Feels like Harry is moping around the castle most of the time or stalking Draco (and how exactly did he get away with not being punished for sending a bloody laceration spell against Draco and leaving him bleeding to death, as Snape was standing there watching?)  And much like in the book, I was left puzzled by many of Gandalf, I mean, Dumbledore's actions through the film.  For instance, when seeking out a horcrux in a creepy dark ocean cave, perhaps you should, I don't know, bring along a few other experienced wizards as well? If the problem involved drinking stinky old water wouldn't it have made sense to bring along Snape, the potions master, to help reverse the effects?)
I will say that I liked the character of Horace Slughorn and thought he was an enjoyable addition to the series. In fact, his character and mannerism struck me that he's make a fantastic Doctor Who, but that will probably never happen.
Dumbledore's funeral was brief and anticlimactic. I felt the book did a lot more justice to this than a brief ""everyone lift your wand"" gimmick.",1459900800,,1212,4.734597156398104

Even my 11 year old Grandson kept saying that's not the way it happened Gram or why did they have that person do that, what happened to such and such. They left out way too much that leads to the final showdown with voldimort and added in stuff that was so unnecessary as to be ridiculous. It was extremely over acted and the Lavendar Brown character was just plain sickening to watch. This one was poorly directed and the changes they made, made absolutely no sense. I bought it only to have it with the rest of the set. The others I can watch over and over, not this one. The first 2 movies were my favorites'",1454284800,,739,4.24822695035461

3039950,3,B000ZECQ08,"The film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, the sixth in the franchise, follows the lead of the titular installment in the Potter book series by focusing not on Harrys academic life but on his nonacademic pursuits yet fail to convey the importance of items and set the stage for franchises final installments as well as add and remove too much.

Though those in charge of production and direction claim Half-Blood Prince was boiled down to the essential plot and foreshadowing elements needed for future films likes its three predecessors it is untrue.  Throughout the film, as well as in the books, there are two main subplots the revelations of the Voldemorts Horcruxes and Draco Malfoys mission and while the latter was handled perfectly the former was botched with missing scenes that impact future installments.  The addition of Jim Broadbent to the cast as Professor Horace Slughorn was a brilliant selection and the Slughorn secondary plot was handled properly in context to the overall Horcrux discovery.  The climactic scene in the Astronomy Tower between Dumbledore, Draco, and Snape with Harry watching was brilliantly acted and portrayed making it one of the few highlights of the overall film.

Aside from the edition of Broadbent there were no other major cast additions, the younger cast members performed admirably with the material they were given which is not a slight on them but of the script. Of the older returning cast members of the cast both Michael Gambons Dumbledore and Alan Rickmans Severus Snape were excellent given either their primary or major impactful roles in this particular film.

The sixth installment of the Harry Potter franchise is an uneven film, and in my opinion worse than Goblet of Fire.  My assessment of this film for a non-book reader is that they would find the film incomprehensible as to everything going on, while book readers would question why important scenes were ignored in the Horcrux subplot that would be relevant in the Deathly Hallows along with the inclusion of new scenes that did nothing but try to be different from the book.  In all honestly, I would rate this film 2  stars instead of 3 if I had the option.",1450569600,,2196,4.945652173913044

Especially when said final battle could not have been a bigger disappointment. Reading both scenes I was on an emotional roller coaster with such high stakes for characters that readers have seen slowly develop.  The battle of Helms Deep in no way took away from the final battle in LOTR, and that was only 3 films.

3040006,4,B000ZECQ08,"While I enjoy these film adaptations, I want to highly recommend you read the novels first. While the film's are done very well, each novel is filled with such rich detail, you can't help but lose quite a bit of magic in transition from page to screen. Specifically starting with the third novel, ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" and through the end of the series, so much is trimmed for the purpose of the film running time, that whole chunks of story and sometimes even great characters and character development never makes it to the screen.

Harry is returning to his 6th year at Hogwarts, but after the events in ""The Order of the Phoenix"", he finds himself a bigger celebrity than ever. Voldemort is gaining more power and his Death Eaters are bringing havoc to not lonely the Wizarding world, but causing harm to the muggle world as well, killing or kidnapping anyone that gets in their way. Harry, Ron and Hermione suspect that Draco Malfoy has joined the Death Eaters, and suspect that he is plotting with the Dark Lord to overthrow Hogwarts.

I will say that this film seems to change the most from the source material. Yes the basic storyline is the same, but tons of details are swapped around. For instance in the novel, Dumbledore warns Harry against being ""collected"" by Professor Slughorn, when in the film it's said that Dumbledore wants Harry to become part of the ""Slug Club"". Sure it's a small detail, but it the shift changes the characters, and their actions, quite a bit from the page to the screen. There are similar changes throughout the telling of this story, with some fantastic character development surrounding Voldemort that is completely left. out.

This film seems much darker in tone, even in the way it's shot, there are no sweeping shots of the castle or grounds. When Hogwarts is shown,  it's usually in the dark or the sky is murky cloudy. The wonderous, magical quality is toned way down in the film, so that instead of fantasy, you feel uneasy about what has happened in Harry's world. A good film, but bit more morose and melancholy than what's come before it.",1443398400,,2094,4.682065217391305

3040119,4,B000ZECQ08,"Count this installment as yet another transition in the series, a stepping stone or segue from one episode to the next in the continuing saga of the young wizard.  ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,"" the 2009 movie adaptation of J.K. Rowlings's novel, is the next-to-last chapter in the seven-book series but is the sixth movie in a succession of eight, with the seventh book taking up the final two films.  Here in this ""Ultimate Edition"" box set, we have ""The Half-Blood Prince"" in Blu-ray high definition, decked out with an array of new special features.

Although ""The Half-Blood Prince"" is hardly a stand-alone movie as some in the series have been, it is, nevertheless, among the more enjoyable, placing its emphasis not purely on action or adventure but on characterizations and interrelationships.  As such, it is a more mature film than many of the others and a more satisfying one, at least for viewers who respect and appreciate thought and emotion over dynamite thrills.  Be aware, however, that it is also among the darkest installments in the series so far, and as such it isn't quite the high-definition feast for the eyes that some earlier episodes have been.  Still, it looks quite good, with a lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack to match.

Suggesting that ""The Half-Blood Prince"" is a transitional story is not, however, to say it is without its unique twists and revelations.  Indeed, it is the sometimes startling, sometimes poignant new developments that keep the story going:  the circumstances regarding Professor Snape, Professor Dumbledore, Ron Weasley, Ginny Weasley, and Harry himself.  They are often quite surprising circumstances, actually, and the plot uses them to set us up the final two-part segment to come, the climax of the entire saga, ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.""

British director David Yates, who not only directed this film but ""The Order of the Phoenix"" and both installments of ""The Deathly Hallows,"" seems more interested in building mood, atmosphere, and character relationships than in continually hitting the viewer over the head with exciting exploits and whizbang special effects.  For the die-hard action fan, this may be a shortcoming of the Yates installments; for fans of the novels, it may be a major strength.  ""The Half-Blood Prince"" might move along more casually, more leisurely, than some episodes in the series, but in the long run it rewards the viewer with more information and more-satisfying interconnections among the principal players.

We get most of the usual cast back, so I need not mention them again or who is playing whom.  The only new character of interest is Professor Horace Slughorn, played by the ever-dependable Jim Broadbent, who seems to be making a career of playing older, slightly eccentric professor types lately, and doing it nicely (""Harry Potter,"" ""Chronicles of Narnia,"" ""Indiana Jones,"" ""Inkheart"").

OK, here's the rundown:  Voldemort is becoming more powerful than ever, and Hogworts has become a virtual fortress, with guards at the gates and magic spells protecting the perimeter against Deatheaters and Dementors.  Dumbledore has recruited Professor Slughorn ostensibly to teach the potions class at Hogworts, but it's actually because Slughorn knows something about Voldemort that can help to defeat him, and Dumbledore wants Harry to help find it out.  Simultaneously, we learn at the very beginning of the tale that Dumbledore has promoted Professor Snape, always a dubious character, to Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher.  We also learn that Snape is involved in possibly nefarious dealings with the maniacal Bellatrix Lestrange and the mother of the odious Draco Malfoy to protect Draco from harm and ensure the boy carries out some undisclosed evil deed.  Meanwhile, amidst these malevolent goings-on Harry and his friends Ron, Hermione, and Ginny are experiencing growing pains as love blossoms at the school, and they must each determine who they really like.

In addition to all of this, Harry finds a textbook in advanced potions-making containing answers to complex spells written in the margin by one of the book's previous owners of long ago, a mysterious person who signed the book only ""The Half-Blood Prince.""  What's all that about?  We must wait to find out.

Then there's the introduction late in the proceedings of an obscure and powerful piece of magical property known as a Horcrux, a device used by Dark Wizards to extend life even unto immortality.  More sinister yet, Lord Voldemort has apparently hidden away a number of these Horcruxes, which, if he reacquires them, will enable him to become the most-powerful Wizard on the planet, with the goal of conquering the world.  Poor Harry.  So little time; so much to do.

""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" is at least as dark and foreboding as ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" and ""The Order of the Phoenix,"" yet, thankfully (and perhaps ironically), it also contains a good deal more humor, more sweet friendships, and more warm character illuminations than the others.  Parts of ""The Half-Blood Prince"" are more elaborately embroidered, too, more dramatically illustrated, than in the novel--like the segment's ending, to be sure--but for the most part we get a deliberately paced, measured view of the characters, their motivations, and their relationships as they march onward toward the saga's conclusion.

Along the way, we get one of the longest yet most-delightfully entertaining installments in the ""Harry Potter"" series.

Video:
Understand, this is an extremely dark film, one of the darkest films yet in the ""Potter"" series, and as such it has a darkly wrought appearance.  The WB video engineers use a dual-layer BD50 and a VC-1 codec to reproduce the film in its theatrical aspect ratio, 2.40:1, capturing the  gloomy duskiness of the original print pretty well, insofar as I remember it from a movie theater, with healthy black levels and good shadow detail.  The filmmakers shot a majority of the film at nighttime (or simulated nighttime), in simulated storms, and in simulated shadowy passageways, so don't expect the usual, bright visual delights.  Nevertheless, there is good definition throughout, even though the film varies in sharpness from scene to scene from somewhat soft in some parts to beautifully crisp in others.  Different cameras, different lenses, different lighting, different bit rates, etc., produce different results.

In terms of the technical qualities of the Blu-ray 1080p transfer, it's probably as good as it can be, with no signs of edge enhancement, noise or noise filtering, pixilation, color banding, or the like.  While the image doesn't always look great in its near-monotone shades of grays, blues, greens, and sepia browns, it appears to be the way its creators meant it to look.

Audio:
The soundtrack comes via lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, and it is more subtle than you might expect from a ""Potter"" extravaganza, most likely because this is not a usual ""Potter"" extravaganza.  Complementing the nuances of the plot and characterizations, the soundtrack uses the surrounds with delicacy, introducing small, unobtrusive noises into the sound design like the twitter of birds, the creaking of antique objects, and the breeze through the castle towers, accompanied by an attractive musical bloom in composer Nicholas Hooper's score.  The advantage of the lossless track comes across in the midrange, which is smooth and natural, and the bass, which is bold, taut, and robust.  In all, the DTS-HD Master Audio provides refined, evocative sound.

Extras:
Disc one of this two-disc ""Ultimate Edition"" Blu-ray set contains the feature film and a ""Maximum Movie Mode,"" with picture-in-picture commentary from Daniel Radcliffe and many of the cast and crew as they take us behind the scenes while we watch the movie; plus, there's a series of ""Focus Points,"" fourteen brief featurettes that one can view either during the ""Maximum Movie Mode"" or separately.

In addition, the first disc contains thirty scene selections; BD-Live access; English, English descriptive narrative, French, German, Spanish, Dutch, and Portuguese spoken languages; French, Spanish, Dutch, and Portuguese subtitles; and English and German captions for the hearing impaired.

Disc two is also a Blu-ray (BD25) and contains the majority of the special features.  First up is ""Creating the World of Harry Potter, Part 6:  Magical Effects.""  It's sixty-four minutes long and takes us behind the scenes of the special effects in the series with commentary from the cast and crew.

Next is another featurette on special effects, ""Behind the Magic,"" about forty-seven minutes.  Then, there are ""J.K. Rowling:  A Year in the Life,"" about fifty minutes on the author, with spoilers; ""Close-up with the Cast of Harry Potter,"" eight segments with the cast and filmmakers totaling about twenty-eight minutes; ""One-Minute Drills,"" seven minutes with the young actors recalling their roles in the plot; ""What's on Your Mind?,"" about six minutes of questions and answers with the cast; ""The Wizarding World of Harry Potter,"" about eleven minutes on the Universal Orlando Resort; ""First Footage from Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,"" about two minutes promoting the final installments; eight additional scenes at about seven minutes; and five interstitials, one teaser trailer, and three theatrical trailers.

Lastly, because this is an ""Ultimate Edition,"" there are the usual collectibles: a beautifully illustrated, forty-four-page, hardbound book; an attractive lenticular picture; two limited-edition cards:  Draco Malfoy and Albus Dumbledore; and instructions and code for a downloadable digital copy of the film (the offer expiring on June 12, 2012).  Everything comes enclosed in a handsomely embossed, hard-cardboard box, further enclosed in a hard-cardboard slipcover (with the detachable lenticular picture on the front).

Parting Thoughts:
While the movie's only shortcoming is its extreme length, 153 minutes, that may also be a strength for those viewers who value getting their money's worth, especially when it means enjoying the high-definition picture and sound more.  And there is no question the two-and-a-half hours go by entertainingly enough, making ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" one of the most affecting episodes in the ""Potter"" series.  With its powerfully impassioned ending, ""The Half-Blood Prince"" leads Harry and his friends into the greatest adventure of them all in the final segments.",1433548800,,10542,5.3124623720650215

After the third one I could never get through one in under a few weeks since they were so dark, boring, and repetitive and at the same time really funny.  Not having read any of the books, no intention I had nothing to compare it to.  What struck me hysterically funny is here we have parents paying boatloads of money and the same theme from the first one carries through, useless teachers.  They pay all this money for their kids to get murdered, teachers who lines and parts mostly consist of well, we'll have to close the school, what do we do!  Three kids who basically run the entire school just run amok.  Should have really stopped at the third one.",1433030400,,758,4.41726618705036

About as long as the first film. I actually like the movie better than the book. I feel the book was poorly written, dragged out with mindless detail and Harry, Ron and Hermione were out of character. But in the movie it doesn't drag out.

The movie is indeed dark, but it is supposed to be. There are hilarious scenes involving teen romance and such. I think the reason this movie and book gets hate is because of who dies at the end.

But when I compare this to OOTP, its a NICE refresh and a really good movie.",1423612800,,681,4.112781954887218

3040238,4,B000ZECQ08,This was probably my favorite of the Harry Potter films particularly because of the beautiful imagery of Professor Snape's flashbacks with he and Lily Potter as children.  It's a beautiful sad love story and I felt sympathy for Snape and so apparently in the end does Harry when he realized that Snape had loved his mother all those years and so Harry's son was named after Severus.

Can you remember the Superman films?  Can you remember how tired they got and how quickly?  It is outstandingly difficult to maintain a franchise.  The characters do what they can and are finished.  The special effects no longer dazzle.  The whole enterprise just slowly deflates and is seen no more.  This is the sixth in the Harry Potter series.  One hopes for the best.
 And one gets it.  Part of the reason is that we are dealing with young actors.  We get to actually watch them grow up physically on the big screen.  The big reason that this Harry Potter effort holds our interest is that it is so different from the others.  There are no scary three headed dogs or body snatching trees.  The magic in the magic world is now taken totally for granted, just part of the back drop.  The focus is on the two plots, one of the dangerous Dark Lord and his evil minions and the other revolves around-what else with teenagers?-romance.
 I expected a fast action adventure and was delighted to discover the slow, careful unfolding of a drama.  Brilliant, in the words of the Brit players.  I greeted the characters like cousins at a family reunion.  They all have bits of story to tell me, and as they become older the stories become more mature and interesting.
 This film runs a good Moneys worth 2hours and 33 minutes.  It has a PG rating but there is no bad language or nudity.  Alan Rickman is measured and subtle as the chief bad guy, a bravo performance.
 World wide, Potter fans are flocking to the film.  The three and a half saw blade movie has already plucked $400 million from movie goers around the globe.  I must now wait for the next Potter film.  I am eager.",1414454400,,1712,4.459546925566343

3040410,3,B000ZECQ08,"This is one of my favorite Harry Potter books. The movie is good but it loses 2 stars because I don't like how they changed parts of the story line unnecessarily. In not opinion, it really takes away from the story. I understand the need to trim things to make it fit in the alloted time, but why change an event completely? For instance, Harry and Jenny's relationship was glossed over and anticlimactic in the end as if an afterthought. Would it have really taken so much to bring them together the way J.K. wrote it? Yet, Ron and Lavender and the dynamic b/t Ron and Hermione was well done. Why cut out Bill and Fleur's engagement, That could have been worked in without adding scenes. There were some other instances as well. It's definitely worth watching, but I was disappointed with some of the choices they made this time around. If you can, read the book too.",1408579200,,868,4.5

This, in and of itself probably is not an issue if the story was so jam-packed and meddled.  Seriously, half the time I don't understand what's happening even though I read the book and I remember the details from it very clearly.  It really is not all that engaging because of it.  One saving grace though, is a character Luna Lovegood.  Luna cuts out distinctively 3-dimensional persona against a backdrop of flat, predictable, and slightly boring characters.",1407196800,,656,4.821428571428571

Unfortunately, the movie was a big disappointment for my children, who loved the earlier movies. The movie seemed disjointed and appeared as mostly a series of unrelated scenes (my 10 year-olds perspective which I agree with). Some more magic and wonder would have been nice. Some more background on Snape's past and why he labeled himself the ""Half Blood Prince"" would have been nice too.",1399852800,,486,4.729411764705882

Given an unexpected opportunity to cheat, he grabs it.  He stops just short of rude.  He continues, though, despite his best efforts, to exhibit his underlying noble character.  The shocking conclusion - it still shocks me, no matter how many times I have seen the movie - puts his feet back on the ground.  Overnight Harry again faces the evil forces in the world and his compulsion to fight them.

To amazon's credit, I got an email about a week later saying that they recognized the quality had been poor and refunded me my money.

3040524,5,B000ZECQ08,"Easily my favorite of all eight movies.

LOVE the Harry Potter series. Never thought I'd say that, being the Christian girl who wrote a scathing paper on the evils of Harry Potter, promoting the occult to youth and blah, blah, blah. I read over that paper I ACTUALLY SUBMITTED TO A COLLEGE PROFESSOR and wanted to go back in time and slap that girl into reality.

A Potterhead friend practically begged me to give the series a chance, and it is easily my favorite book series, next to Chronicles of Narnia. I am awaiting the day my 19 month old son is ready for me to read chapter books with him; because this will be our first! The tale woven throughout each of the seven books (eight movies) is one of true, genuine, sacrifical, loving friendship, not only standing up but also FIGHTING for what you believe in (especially when that belief is on the side of good), wins and losses and giving everything you have because it's the right thing to do. I just cannot praise these books enough. If you're on the fence about whether or not you'd want to bother with a ""young adult/kid"" series... just stop. Crack open a used (but very loved) copy of Sorcerer's Stone and GET. SWEPT. UP. in one of the greatest stories of bravery and perseverance and love and --geez, I should stop-- LIFE ever told. Or watch the first movie. And then the second... and all the rest.

However, the most important parts of this book was the background information on Tom Riddle, which is unfortunately barely touched on; there's more reasons to fear He-Who-Should-Not-Be-Named than just a missing nose, and the movie failed to deliver.
From my own personal prejudice: I love the storyline between Harry and Ginny, and the movie goes entirely off-script.  In the movie, their first kiss is alone and in private; in the book, it's in public with everyone watching.  Long live the bold and gorgeous Ginny Weasley.",1383091200,,796,5.061068702290076

3040666,1,B000ZECQ08,"The 6th installment in the Harry Potter movie adaptions is a disappointment for anyone who has read the books, and confusing for those who haven't. Large sections of the plot have been removed, whilst adding in nothing that contributes significantly to the story. As a consequence, hardcore Potter-heads are left feeling disappointed with the adaptation, and non-readers simply cannot follow the plot. All meaning has been drained from a story which was full of subtle nuances and heart.",1374105600,,487,5.256410256410256

3040674,5,B000ZECQ08,"When our grandkids started reading the Harry Potter books I became concerned but put it off and off.  I had found the Hobbit to be dumb until I reread it two more times and finally understood where that author was coming from....that only a Hobbit could turn away from temptation.  Then I endured the entire violent Rings thing.  Well. Okay.

Then I read about this woman who has hard times and writes this stuff about this ordinary boy.  Boy.  Ordinary.  So any kid can identify with him.  Hmmm.

Then I read the books.  Then my husband read the books.  Then we read the books aloud to each other...AGAIN! and AGAIN.
How could anyone create this stuff, even if it did seem as though we had read most of the things in someone else's writing first.  And tears ""leaking from his eyes""  repeatedly used....not artful  But, oh, my gosh, how exquisite, how gripping.
And then out come the movies with these precious kids and these superb adult actors that we often later see in something like Stephen Sondheim's later version of Sweeney Todd:  The Demon of Fleet Street.  What talent.

What direction.  The only criticism would be that the later movies do not have directors insisting on slowing down the kids' dialogues as well as the first two did.
The color, the creativity, the story, the acting, the people.
UNFORGETTABLE.  Everyone ought to get past the ""witch and wizard"" thing  and thinks about platform nine and three-auarters!

What a marvel.  And we woulda missed it if we had been stuffy old people.  Shame, it would have been.
Thank you, all involved and especially Jo Ann Rowling.  You deserve every shilling you got!

3040676,5,B000ZECQ08,"Bought this sometime ago but just getting around to reviewing it.  I thought I had done it already.

Having read all the HP books and watched all the HP movies, I must say that I am impressed.  Yes, the movies leave a lot of stuff out of them - but think about it - how long would the movies have been had they followed the book exactly?

Given that, the movies, even though a series, can stand on their own individually.  Of course, it does help if you watch them as intended.

The naysayers will bellyache about the acting.  To which I say ""Get over it.""  This has been one of the most successful franchises in print and movie history and it leave two-bit series like twilight in the dust.",1373155200,,691,4.2615384615384615

3040678,4,B000ZECQ08,"As far as explanations, I preferred the book better to the movie.  The Half-Blood Prince gives the history of Tom Riddle/Lord Voldemort--and the explanations were more interesting and extensive in the book rather than in the movie.  However, the movie gives you enough information so that you will understand the later plots in the following sequels.

However, there is one thing I do like better in the movie than in the book--there are more scenes with Bellatrix Lestrange! For someone who was the Dark Lord's most faithful servant, who went to Azkaban for 14 years because she refused to renounce him, I felt J.K. failed to give her enough scenes and character development.  The movie gave this character more screen time, and Helena Bonham Carter is always the person you should go to to play a lunatic.  She is so good at it, I really question her mental stability in real life.

This movie allows you to see the good side to some characters you thought were bad, and it begins to make you uncertain about characters you thought were good.  It also prepares you for the many deaths of well-loved characters that are to come.",1372809600,2,1129,4.729591836734694
3040679,2,B000ZECQ08,"I have enjoyed other Harry Potter movies, and have read some of the books. I found this to be rather mixed up and confusing, kind of a mish-mash. Also, maybe it's just my DVD player, but many of the scenes seemed over-dark visually, not enough light or contrast to even tell what was going on.

For being so long, it seemed there were a fair number of parts that moved pretty slowly.

If someone had not previously had a lot of exposure to the Harry Potter stories, it would be quite confusing.

As usual, Severus Snape was well acted, and there were a few good parts. But overall, seemed kind of a waste of time.",1372809600,,613,4.3130434782608695

3040682,5,B000ZECQ08,"As I have stated before in some of my earlier reviews, its obvious that you cannot take a book that has more pages and words than bees have hives and make a movie. You can however, take a book and make a movie that stays true to form and does its best to keep up with the pace of the original novel. In that category we have: Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince.

The acting in this movie was great. I feel that Alan Rickman, Michael Gambon, and even Tom Felton  (though he is a bit of a cry baby at times in this one) shine in this movie especially.

Harry Potter is growing up rapidly as he is now 16 and set to start another year at Hogwarts. Dumbledore meets Harry outside of the wizarding world and then asks a favor of Harry. From there, we meet a new professor, Horace Slughorn. Not long after these series of events while Harry is on his way to Hogwarts with Ron and Hermione, suspicions arise after seeing Draco and Narcissa talking to what appears to be Death Eaters. And that is only the beginning of the mystery.

Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince deals with issues such as: love, loyalty, and sacrifice. The tone of the movie overall can be described as engagingly humorous, eagerly romantic, but as serious as the book is; some even argue that this is one of the darker stories in the series, I can be inclined to agree tremendously. It is an enjoyable 153 minute movie.

Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince's final score:

5 stars",1372291200,4,1456,4.315018315018315

I've seen all the movies at least once, if not more than that, over the years. I'm now getting my husband to watch the series. He's actually really enjoyed it so far, but he fell asleep during this one. It is just much slower than the others. The action doesn't really start until the last 45 mins of the movie.

3040707,5,B000ZECQ08,"""Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Voldemort is tightening his grip on both the Muggle and wizarding worlds and Hogwarts is no longer the safe haven it once was. Harry suspects that dangers may even lie within the castle, but Dumbledore is more intent upon preparing him for the final battle that he knows is fast approaching. Together they work to find the key to unlock Voldemort's defenses and, to this end, Dumbledore recruits his old friend and colleague, the well-connected and unsuspecting bon vivant Professor Horace Slughorn, whom he believes holds crucial information. Meanwhile, the students are under attack from a very different adversary as teenage hormones rage across the ramparts. Harry finds himself more and more drawn to Ginny, but so is Dean Thomas. And Lavender Brown has decided that Ron is the one for her, only she hadn't counted on Romilda Vane's chocolates! And then there's Hermione, simmering with jealousy but determined not to show her feelings. As romance blossoms, one student remains aloof. He is determined to make his mark, albeit a dark one. Love is in the air, but tragedy lies ahead and Hogwarts may never be the same again.

The cast led by Daniel Radcliffe (as Harry), Rupert Grint (as Ron) & Emma Watson (as Hermione) is excellent! The directing by David Yates (who also directed ""Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix"" (2007), he is also directed the upcoming ""Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Parts I & II"" (2010 & 2011) is excellent! The screenplay (based On J.K. Rowling's novel) by Steve Kloves (who also did the screenplays to ""Wonder Boys"" (2000) & almost all of the Harry Potter movies, with the exception of ""The Order Of The Phoenix"") is excellent!

The music by Nicholas Hooper (who also did the music to ""Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix"") is excellent! The cinematography by Bruno Delbonnel (who also did the cinematography to ""Across The Universe"" (2007) is excellent! The film editing by Mark Day (who also did the film editing to ""Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix"" & ""Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Parts I & II"") is excellent! The casting by Fiona Weir (who also did the casting to ""Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire"" (2005), ""Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix"" & ""Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Parts I & II"") is excellent! The production design by Stuart Craig (who also did the production design to all of the Harry Potter movies) is excellent! The art direction by Andrew Ackland-Snow (senior art director) (who also did the art direction to almost all of the Harry Potter movies, with the exception of the upcoming ""The Deathly Hallows Part II""), Alastair Bullock (who has worked on almost all of the Harry Potter movies, with the exception of ""The Sorcerer's Stone"" (2001), Molly Hughes (who has worked on almost all of the Harry Potter movies, with the exception of ""The Sorcerer's Stone"" & ""The Chamber Of Secrets"" (2002), Tino Schaedler (who also did the art direction to the upcoming ""Prince Of Persia: The Sands Of Time"" (2010) and also worked on ""Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix""), Hattie Storey (who has worked on ""Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire"", ""Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix"" & the upcoming ""Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part I""), Gary Tomkins (who has worked on all of the Harry Potter movies) & Sloane U'Ren is excellent! The set decoration by Stephanie McMillan (who also did the set decoration to all of the Harry Potter movies) is excellent! The costume design by Jany Temime (who also did the costume design to almost all of the Harry Potter movies, with the exception of ""The Chamber Of Secrets"" & ""The Sorcerer's Stone"") is excellent!

3040725,5,B000ZECQ08,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is the best movie of the entire series.  Every scene, shot and frame is a Gesamtkunstwerk-a complete work of art blending color, myth, story, music, and mood that flows into the viewer's mind.  It is hypnotic.

The movie advances the series story in that Ron and Hermione reveal their feelings for each other and Harry likewise shows his feelings for Ginny.  Additionally, Voldemort appears to triumph over Dumbledore.  As a result the entire movie, from one end to another invokes a dark spirituality that taps into the deepest myths of Western Civilization.  One scene combines the myth of Merlin and Beowulf in a magical showdown in a cave.

Superb acting by all parties-especially Jim Broadbent who plays a delightful Professor Slughorn as well as Tom Fleton's outstanding portrayal of the torn Draco Malfoy

The best movie of the entire series-rich, complex, intense, and satisfying.",1367107200,,927,5.133333333333334
3040726,2,B000ZECQ08,They can't fit the whole book into a movie or even a mini series but they should at least follow the story.  There are scenes that are obviously not in the book that who knows what they are about. If you enjoyed the book save your money. The movie is a huge disappointment. I gave it two stars because there are some scenes that were in the book.,1366416000,,346,4.088235294117647

3040729,3,B000ZECQ08,"I agree with many reviewers that the movie was a faint imitation of a great book.  While the books themselves get darker in theme,the dark and oppressive atmosphere of the movie  and the lackluster recreation of some of the events in the book made for a mediocre and one dimensional viewing experience.",1366243200,,302,4.788461538461538
3040730,3,B000ZECQ08,"I LOVE Harry Potter like the rest of us book nerds out there but this is by far the worst film of the script-to-screen adaptations in this franchise (Order of the Phoenix being the best in my opinion, not counting the ""resolution"" films).

3040732,3,B000ZECQ08,"I had originally watched this movie about a year after it originally came out. As I'm now listening to the audio book (5 stars there, especially for Jim Dale, the narrator), I thought I re-watch it as frankly I couldn't remember much about it except the end.

I now know why. The full book contains so much detail that it's hard to see how to cram it into a 2 hour movie, and it shows. I failed to feel any sense of ""flow"" through the movie. It jumps so quickly from scene to scene that it feels like a montage of vignettes, not a story. This hurts any immersion into it, which is why it ends up being forgettable if you haven't read the books.

I won't quibble with what was cut or changed as such is rather inevitable with trying to condense a large book into what has to be essentially a novella in length for a movie. In fact, it probably needed to be very aggressively trimmed down some more. Now with the hindsight of what the end of the series was, it probably could be done much better now.",1366156800,,998,4.192708333333333

3040745,4,B000ZECQ08,"I was disappointed with myself for not ordering a copy with a DVD version of the movie.  I do not like being tied down to only one device for viewing.  I cannot view this on my computer or DVD player.  Yes, I realize that Blu-ray only plays in Blu-ray players, but I thought I had ordered Blu-ray and DVD together.",1364515200,,314,4.2
3040746,4,B000ZECQ08,"By this time in the series if you stick with the movies, you know there are substantial portions of the books that are cut out, and even some changes.  I can generally look at the two separately, but the one thing I dislike about this movie is how they change the reason that Harry does not intervene in the climatic scene.  Although most people have likely seen the movie several times and know how it ends I don't want to give away too much just in case someone reading this does not know the ending.  In the book Harry is stunned and covered with his invisibility cloak.  That makes a far better explanation of why he does not help than hiding in the shadows.

Aside from that, I do like the movie.  Again a lot is cut from the book, but the film (aside from what I mentioned above) does seem to follow it fairly well.  I do like that Draco does get to do a lot more in this movie than just sneer at Harry.  Tom Felton proved himself to be a very good actor, which is not something you would have really known from all the other movies because his job has been just to be a pain in the ass.

As with all the other Ultimate Editions, there are a lot of extras.  It does not have an extended edition of the movie.  The deleted scenes are available in the special features, but they are not incorporated into the movie itself.  For some people that will be a deal killer.  Certainly if you have already purchased the theatrical editions you are not going to get anything more in the movie itself.  If you are interested in getting more extras and you are not double dipping by purchasing this, then it is worth adding to your collection.",1364428800,,1637,4.255663430420712

I don't read the books, therefore I miss nothing, but the lead actors are so captivating, they could eat a bowl of rice, & still make it seem worthwhile.

3040779,5,B000ZECQ08,"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince is a fantastically well done and richly satisfying movie. Here,we see the darkest and most mature Harry Potter movie of the 1st 6 by far. The charm and innocence of Sorcerer's Stone that so defined Sorcerer's Stone is completely gone now. Harry is growing up and preparing himself to take on his greatest challenges yet. As those who have read the book know,Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince really has 2 important storylines to it. On one hand,Half Blood Prince is a backstory story where we learn more about Voldemort's past. At the same time,Half Blood Prince is also a setup story as the events that occur in Half Blood Prince in real time are setting up the events of Deathly Hallows. The film does a brilliant job of bringing those things to life. I was especially happy with the depiction of the day Dumbledore first met the young Tom riddle. That was a scene the filmmakers nailed. I was also very pleased with the way the circumstances of the Half Blood Prince's book were handled,both in terms of that 1st Potions lessons and in the scene where Harry is forced to get rid of it. Then the acting was superb. Daniel,Rupert,Emma,and Alan have mastered their characters by this movie. And Michael Gambon gives his best performance as Dumbledore in this movie,particularly in the many scenes in which he and Harry are alone together, Finally,I was immensely satisfied with the climax. Apart from the presentation of the events themselves,the emotional aspects of the climax hit the heart for me. Even after many viewings,I get teary eyed when Dumbledore dies and when the students are all raising their wands in tribute to him. This is a very poignant time for Hogwarts. In this movie,Dumbledore is preparing Harry for what lies ahead as events culminate in the climax that sets up the major war in Deathly Hallows. My only criticisms are that they should have included the memory where that witch shows Voldemort the Cup and Locket so they,as Horcruxes that become important in Deathly Hallows, would be properly introduced in this movie. That memory should have been in the movie instead of the Ron-Lavender and Dean-Ginny stuff,which should have been cut from the movie (and the book) because it added NOTHING to the plot.  Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince is a deeply rewarding movie that MUST get 5 stars.",1361491200,,2365,4.796568627450981

The problem is the disc they sent me.  First of all, it was not shrink wrapped. Used?  I don't buy used dvd's.  And it was shipped by Amazon, along with other free shipping items, so it should have been new. When I opened it, there was a large blue blob on the face of the disc.  I tried to remove said blue blob gently, but it did not come off.  Since the disc played okay, I guess IO can't complain about the blue crud.

3040828,5,B000ZECQ08,"Director David Yates takes us through Harry Potter's (Daniel Radcliffe) pivotal sixth year at Hogwarts, where we see him growing still closer to his final confrontation with the Dark Wizard (Ralph Fiennes), who would quite faciley harm a guy in glasses.
  Still reeling from the aftermath of the Battle of the Ministry of Magic, Hary hasn't spent much time at his relatives' residence in Little Whinging, but has spent much of the summer riding trains to keep his mind off of things.
  At one point, as he is reading his wizarding world newspaper in a Muggle diner in Little Whinging, he enters into a flirtation with a pretty waitress(Elarica Gallander) who takes an interest in the contents of his newspaper. But a promising date with the young lady is aborted by the unexpected arrival of Dumbledore(Michael Gambon), who escorts Harry to the residence of Professor Horace Slughorn(Jim Broadbent) who is hiding from Voldemort and the Death Eaters. This professor, like many, knew Harry's parents, and Dumbledore wishes to have him reinstated at Hogwarts, as his presence there is essential to the defeat of Voldemort. Slughorn, who remembers Harry mother, Lily(Geraldine Sommerville), his former student, with a particular fondness, agrees to do so.
 Spending time with the Weasleys at their home, The Burrow before returning to school, Harry and his best friends, Ron(Rupert Grint)and Hermione(Emma Watson), enjoy each other's company, having a laugh over a wisecrack about Dumbledore's supposed age as they gather round an indoor fire burning from a magically suspended wad of newspaper, in what will be an ironic moment.
 As they leave the new joke shop run by Ron's brothers, twins Fred and George(James and Oliver Phelps), the three friends notice Draco Malfoy(Tom Felton)and his mother, Narcissa( Helen McCrory) going into Borgin and Burkes wandshop in the seedy Knockturn Alley, where they associate with Death Eaters. Voldemort has chosen Draco for a secret mission as the Dark Lord's grip on the wizarding and Muggle worlds tightens. Making an Unbreakable Vow with Narcissa a Bellatrix Lestrande's (Helena Bonham Carter) behest, Severus Snape( Alan Rickman) promises to shield Draco and accept the assignment if Draco fails to carry it out.
  Amid torment from Draco on the Hogwarts Express, Luna Lovegood(Evanna Lynch)rescues Harry.
  Once back on campus, Professor McGonnagal(Maggie Smith) urges Harry and Ron to take Slughorn's Potions class at the last moment, resulting in their having to borrow textbooks for the course, since they don't have their own. The phrase ""Half- Blood Prince"" is on the flypage of Harry's textbook, which features additional information ennabling him to excel in the class, even besting the brilliant Hermione.
 In the meantime, Ron, the new Keeper of the Gryffindor Quidditch team wins a game because Harry psychs him into believing he has been given the potion, Liquid Luck.
 The new sports hero celebrates his new status as well as his budding romance with the ditzy Lavender Brown(Jessie Cave). Hermione is reviled and hurt by this,  turning to Harry for consolation as he admits his own feelings for Ron's sister, Ginny (Bonnie Wright), who is currently dating his roomate, Dean Thomas(Alfie Enoch).
  Among the mysteries Harry and company will deal with besides that of the riddle of the Half-Blood Prince will be the mystery of what Slughorn knows about Voldemort's rise to power,and the curious possesion of student Katie Bell (Georgian Leonidas) after she is exposed to a beautiful necklance in a jewel case outside of Hogsmeade, and the question McGonagall broaches to him, Ron, and Hermione:""Why is it that when something happens, it is always you three?""
  This film will also reveal the loss of one of gamekeeper Hagrid's (Robbie Coltrane) cherished companions,and Harry's use of that opportunity to get Slughorn to reveal the truth about Voldemort's rise to power, as well as Harry's growing relationship with the Weasleys and Professor Lupin's(David Thewlis) and Tonks(Natalia Tena)amid the destruction of the Weasley's home by Bellatrix Lestrange and Fenrir Greyback(Dave Legano).
  Soon, the young James Bond of the Wizarding World will lose his staunchest champion amid a touching tribute led by McGonagall, in which the light of the wands of Hogwarts will drive the Dark Mark from the sky,hopefully symbolic of a favorable outcome for the forces of good in the not-too-distant future.",1356307200,,4446,5.254237288135593

3040882,4,B000ZECQ08,"Ah the Half Blood Prince, we're nearing the end.  This is after all the sixth book/movie in the series.  And if you haven't seen any of the others go do that first, you shouldn't be starting here.  It just doesn't make sense.  Moving on, I was a little more relieved to see that this movie followed the story better than the previous ones, but not nearly as good as the first few movies in the series.

Voldemort is back and the entire wizarding community now knows it.  Still reeling from the loss of Sirius, Harry approaches school with a restlessness that can't seem to settle.  He also realizes he has rising feelings for a classmate and a rising hatred for Draco Malfoy who he suspects is up to no good.  Under the tutelage of Dumbledore he begins to learn about Lord Voldemort and start unraveling the mysteries of how to beat him.  But he's more dangerous than ever, especially with all of his followers free and eager to get at Harry.  Even Hogwarts is weakening in its protection of the students.  And it's hard to concentrate on school let alone learn in that type of environment.

Characters:
Daniel Radcliffe:  Harry Potter
Rupert Grint: Ron Weasley
Emma Watson: Hermione Granger
Helena Bonham Carter: Bellatrix Lestrange
Jim Broadbent: Horace Slughorn
Robbie Coltrane: Rubeus Hagrid
Warwick Davis: Filius Flitwick
Tom Felton: Draco Malfoy
Michael Gambon: Albus Dumbledore
Alan Rickman: Severus Snape
Maggie Smith: Minerva McGonagall
David Thewlis: Remus Lupin

Radcliffe did another fantastic job in this movie.  He really shows the maturity that Harry gets after the events of the previous year and what he's seen.  It was really neat to see him grow that way.  Grint and Watson were also good, just not as good as Radliffe, although they all still work marvelously together.  Carter as Bellatrix is always a hoot to watch, she's got the mad nutter routine down well and you can't help but giggle even if she is a bad guy.  Gambon really stepped it up as Dumbledore as well, he finally had that compassion that I'd come to expect from the books and he really looks after Harry in this one.  That and he is very very brave in the role he has to play.  The rest of the characters were ok, I enjoyed Luna Lovegood again and Ron's girlfriend is a sight to behold as goofy as she is.  But they didn't really take center stage and Radcliffe had the most screentime, as is proper.

This one followed the book a little better, but it was still missing several scenes that really made the story.  But it did include some really good ones, especially the scenes with Dumbledore and Harry.  I appreciated that they took quite a bit of movie time to include those.  But still, there was a little bit of rushing in this story and I kind of wish with some of these books that they would have split them in two like they did with the last book.  I think it would have really made the series better, especially for fans of the books.  Regardless, the movie was still enjoyable and I can definitely see those who haven't read the book enjoying it completely.

The special effects were ok in this one.  The details were missing again, and it seemed that the good special effects were only brought out for the big stuff (with the exception of the beginning in Fred & George's store, that was excellent).  I wish that they would go back to working on the details, it's what made the first two movies so wonderful.  The music was a little less in this one too, and even the starting song was changed slightly.  Not enough to really disappoint me, but enough that I noticed.  Overall, I guess I just have to say I wish they put as much care into this movie as they did the first.

Still a valuable part of the series, and you can't watch the rest without watching this one.  It belongs on the shelf with all the rest.

3040883,4,B000ZECQ08,this is the best of them all. i do love every single book and movie about Harry Potter. I normally read books for an older audience but this still captured my heart. Read it and see it!,1348531200,,185,4.027027027027027
3040884,4,B000ZECQ08,"I'll start this off by saying that I loved the first two Harry Potter movies.  Then they made the unfortunate mistake in their replacements of director, composer, and Dumbledore over the next couple installments and I grew increasingly frustrated with the series.  They cut out important parts of the book to focus on things that didn't even happen!  How could they cut out the Quidditch World Cup in the fourth movie?!

Anyway, the film series has gotten a bit better since then, but it's weird when I'm kinda happy that Dumbledore died in this movie... I really disliked Gambon in the role.  This one seems to take CGI and effects to a new level, to the detriment of other aspects of the movie and plot.  Still, if you're a fan of the series, get it.",1348444800,,752,4.533333333333333

3040888,4,B000ZECQ08,"I have read and enjoyed all the Potter books. I appreciate the way that Rowling's had the People  grow and mature..I never thought that the films followed the Books that closely..something with the same genesis but a different Exdos.

The latter films are very dark.. both in theme/ execution and in presentation.. i had to turn off the lights and cover over the on light on my player to see some of the scenes!!

It is hard of not impossible to translate some things from books to film.. but given that  the film maker do a good job of presenting a watchable and entertaining film.",1345766400,,582,4.514285714285714

3040890,1,B000ZECQ08,"I found Half-Blood to be very depressing and even worse, so predictable! There is no greater sin in writing a story than being boring! Half-Blood also made no sense. No, I did not read the books, nor would I ever waste my time. The only strength in the world of Harry Potter is the bond amongst friends. This strong sense of friendship and loyalty is the only redeeming element in Harry Potter series!

I guess that's the reason why I, and many other people, keep going to the theater. Of the six films I watched so far only the previous one, film #5, ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"" felt enjoyable and made plenty of sense. In Half-Blood, I'm amazed that you can kill off a major character and have even Harry Potter, himself, going around saying: ""It was a waste, it had no meaning. He died for nothing."" How ironic when a story's main character literally sums up the ENTIRE story!

I had high hopes for Half-Blood! I don't like seeing Harry Potter and all the other ""Good Guys"" being so powerless/clueless, or a main character turning into pure evil for absolutely no reason, whatsoever! (I should be able to know what's going on by not having to read the books. I have watched every film in order, but it still made no sense!)

What is obvious to me is that the Harry Potter series has become a commodity like toothpaste and underarm deodorant! Lets stretch a very thin storyline into as many billions of dollars as possible, and see all the star-struck idiots spend their hard earned money! Sorry to say, Harry Potter could have easily been condensed into a trilogy and if Half-Blood was never written/filmed it would not have harmed the Harry Potter storyline ONE iota!

Sorry, but I refuse to watch the last two (wasn't the grand finale divided into two parts? What a surprise!) Harry Potter films. I have spent enough money on Harry Potter movie tickets and I have no intention, whatsoever, to waste another penny on making the writers and filmmakers of Harry Potter, richer!

This movie was great but is not the extended edition, if that is what you are looking for. I like the cover art and the darker side of the movie series highlighted in the cover.

The cinematic atmosphere through the movie is dark and erie, like you would imagine in the book. This movie is not a direct copy of the book (which movie actually does that?!?) and has its own spin on things.

3040900,3,B000ZECQ08,"J.K. Rowling's tale is, as always, rife with fresh ideas, and her believable characters continue to endure further challenges in the process of growing-up.  Apart from the story's more fanciful elements, there are also some real-life lessons being learned here (in boy-girl relationships and academic cheating among them).

That said, Rowling's extensive narrative doesn't fit so comfortably into a two-and-a-half hour running time.  Screenwriter Steve Kloves manages to get most of it all to work within the prescribed length (though it is hard to see the point of invented scenes like Harry's flirtation with a muggle girl in the London tube station when that screen-time could have been alloted to more of Rowling's own ideas).

Director David Yates handles the material adroitly, but his style feels more perfunctory than the series' previous directors.  One scene in particular (which I won't spoil), is a major -- and devastating -- turning point in Rowling's tale, but it lacks any dramatic intensity and proves something of a lead balloon.  The film is technically well-photographed (by Bruno Delbonnel) but is awash in low-key, shadowy lighting, and a generally drab, washed-out colour scheme.  While effective in the spookier moments, this look doesn't suit the scenes of intimacy or humor, and tends to cast a dreary pall about the film.  Nicholas Hooper provides a serviceable score, but it too is lacklustre compared to the symphonic grandeur of John Williams' Harry Potter music.

However the performers are (as usual) first rate. The established cast bring ever-more freshness to their parts, while newcomer Hero Fiennes-Tiffin (nephew of Ralph Fiennes) makes for an unnervingly sinister Tom Riddle, and veteran actor Jim Broadbent makes a fine Professor Slughorn.

Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a wonderful story which results in a very good film.  Warner Bros. Blu-ray disc boasts an excellent transfer with crisp detail.  But it does lack the epic sweep of the earlier films and doesn't deliver a satisfying emotional payoff, and so proves one of the less-enjoyable Potter adaptations.",1338595200,,2115,5.318318318318318
3040901,4,B000ZECQ08,"This is a great movie that follows the saga of Harry Potter, teenage wizard. This is one of my favorite movies. It is adventure-packed and includes jut the right amount of drama. If you want to compare the movie to the book, it does alright. The movie does a good job at covering the ""important parts"" of the book in the allotted time. Overall this is a great movie.",1337126400,,366,4.318840579710145
3040902,5,B000ZECQ08,"Once I get over all the things left out between the book and the movie (always a wrench), I can enjoy this movie a great deal. It's darker, although perhaps not darker than the Order of the Phoenix. It's also more involved with the personal lives of our main characters. Oddly, though, the kids have grown up so much that I can't be sure which ones are or are not being played by different actors. Not the main characters, certainly: but is Lavender Brown the same? Neville and Luna may or may not be: they are seen so briefly.

Anyway, the basic story is that the Death Eaters are causing a lot of trouble, even in the muggle world, and Dumbledore seems to have a plan to fight back, although the nature of the fight takes some time to develop. Even for him.

He has asked Horace Slughorn to come out of retirement and be the Potions master, while Severus Snape finally gets the position he has wanted all along: Defense Against the Dark Arts. Why? It turns out Tom Riddle was a favorite of Slughorn's when he was at Hogwarts, and Dumbledore is convinced he has vital information about Riddle. You see, Slughorn is a sort of name-dropping groupie of famous witches and wizards and their children. As Dumbledore puts it, he likes to ""collect"" names for his Slug Club. Of course he wants to collect Harry, and Dumbledore asks Harry to get close to him in the hopes of getting the necessary information. Dumbledore has a bottled memory of Slughorn talking to Tom Riddle, but it has been altered. (You know about the bottled memories; they are put into the pensieve in order to be experienced.) It is Harry's mission to get the truth from Slughorn.

Harry succeeds. It turns out Slughorn told Riddle about horcruxes, very dark magic that allows a magician to divide part of his soul and hide it in an object. So if he is killed, it's just that body that dies; he can still recover the hidden part of his soul from the horcrux. Making just one is bad enough, but apparently Voldemort made seven of them. Potter destroyed one, Riddle's diary, in the Chamber of Secrets. Dumbledore found and destroyed a ring which had been in the family of Riddle's mother for some time, and it blackened his hand in the process.

Now he believes he knows where another is hidden: in a cave by the ocean where he takes Harry with him, first extracting a promise from Harry that he will do as Dumbledore asks, no matter what. Harry promises, but it turns out to be pretty horrible to live up to. And even more horrible is what they confront when they return to Hogwarts.

I've told you too much already, especially if you haven't read the books. But believe me, there's a great deal more. For example, just what is Draco Malfoy up to?",1336867200,,2711,4.479757085020243

3040905,4,B000ZECQ08,"As an avid Harry Potter fan (of both the movies and the books) ""The Half-Blood Prince"" is decidedly darker than its predecessors (let's face it---a lot of dark things are going on with Voldemort having the wizarding community in a stranglehold and Harry and Dumbledore trying desperately to find out what makes the Dark Lord tick) but it is an amazing piece of cinematography.  I tire of individuals claiming a movie is not as well as a book-in this case, the movie would be roughly 10 hours long (although I would probably be one who would happily sit through a 10-hour Harry Potter flick).  My only dislikes are simply a matter of what I envisioned when I read the book-the young Voldemort seen in the pensieve did not meet my mental pic (I had him looking like John F Kennedy Jr. or at least John Mayer) and I felt Snape should have been more involved in the movie instead of merely being on the outskirts until the very end.  I love Alan Rickman's Snape and can't get enough of him.  Other than that, the movie is suitably photographed in dark and ominous tones and the acting is wonderful (I love Ron's girlfriend Lavendar Brown).",1334707200,2,1135,4.549019607843137

3040917,5,B000ZECQ08,"First off, this is a review of the movie, NOT the contents of this edition, partly because Amazon attaches the same review to all versions of the same movie that it offers (so this review will also show on the Instant option, etc. - not just the DVD), and partly because other reviewers have already stated the contents of this DVD set in any case.

Like the prior HP movies, this one does have to cut quite a bit from the book, but I think they did an EXCELLENT job of selecting the plot items that most directly relate to the overall direction of the series. And in the series, Book 6 is when it all becomes clear just what a stunning series this is, IMHO. Things turn distinctly dark in book/movie 5, with an internal battle going on between those that believe Voldemort has returned and those that don't, but now in book/movie 6 it is all out war, and this movie reflects the dark, conflicted feelings this triggers in everyone. Coupled with the increasing complexities of adolescent life - romances and break-ups etc. - this movie is much more grown-up.

I think the main things that need to be conveyed in this film are - Harry's conflicted feelings about being the 'chosen one', Dumbledore's ongoing quest to get to the bottom of what Voldemort is trying to do, and his acceptance that he must include Harry in this, the complexity of Snape's role, and the shifting of feelings amongst Hermione, Ron, Jenny and Harry. These are what drive the series, and they are all conveyed brilliantly, in a movie that never fails to entertain, even with its much darker visuals and tone. So although there's a fair amount of the book left out, what is essential is there, and that is what good book adaptation are all about.",1327881600,,1719,4.541935483870968

It's competently acted, well directed, visually it's frankly stunning, and the book it's based on is one of the better ones in the series.  This movie's fun and contains one of the best twists for the uninitiated of the whole series.

If you're looking for the carefree fun and whimsy of the first few films however, you should know that this movie solidifies the shift to a darker and more somber tone for the series.

3040932,1,B000ZECQ08,"The Half-Blood Prince Movie was a HUGE disappointment. It was utter nonsense... *spoiler alert*

The whole subway/train thing in the beginning was stupid. To change to that from the important book opening with the Other Minister? It makes no sense and is unrelated to plot...

A major negative was the whole Burrow-catches-on-fire-scene. What was that all about? It had nothing at all to do with the plot; it didn't contribute anything! Plus, the movie was called the HALF-BLOOD PRINCE, but where was the book?!! They briefly showed it. The part with the Room of Requirement was wrong, too. Ginny did not accompany Harry there so that he would never find the book again. Actually in the book, Harry went there to hide the book from Snape after the Sectumsempra incident with Malfoy. That was a crucial scene in explaining how Harry finds the diadem of Ravenclaw in the 7th book.

& To those who defend that ""movie's must be adapted,"" well, J.K. Rowling's books were masterpieces that would have been brilliant left alone. They entirely skipped the battle scene and funeral - two huge chunks of the book's ending. I mean, really -- how can you DO that? The editors could have chosen to delete un-needed scenes, but to get rid of some of the most important ones and to add entirely fake scenes that didn't develop the plot in any way was just plain stupid. The movie gets most its viewers from fans of the BOOKS. It's called HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE because it is supposed to represent the BOOK.

The whole movie was extremely dark and gloomy - very gray and dull. Instead of trying to be overly artistic, they should have added more color... it was hard to tell when it was day and night. Undeniably the weakest Harry Potter film.",1324425600,2,1743,4.686274509803922

3040934,4,B000ZECQ08,"Those who know me may be inclined to say that I'm not one who's really in a position to review anything associated with Harry Potter, not the least of which being his sixth installment.

I do acknowledge that my indifference for the franchise has flourished in an age dominated by movies that I believe pay more respect to the fantasy realms.

You may understand me, then, when I say that Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is one of the best films I've reviewed all year, and speaks for itself as a testament to the non-believers like myself that such a late film in the saga has driven me into humble conversion.

Those behind the scenes have finally figured out how to bring the people to the center of attention, as opposed to the magic.  And, ironically, you feel that this is the way it was supposed to have been all along.  The magic is still there; it's in the delightfully comfortable actors and actresses, many of which have come to form elegantly and beautifully.

And elegance is certainly the name of the game, here.  Everything about this film emits a sophisticated, casual eloquence to it that is much easier to appreciate than the anxiety and disjointed flash atmosphere that seemed to coalesce in the past films when there was an intermission between significant events.  Novice David Yates was patient this time around, and it paid off in spades.

Predictably, the Harry Potter universe is getting increasingly more crowded, and it would prove difficult for anyone to keep screen time balanced.  Yates does this with as much precision as one could, all things considered, but it is saddening to see some once-prominent characters now taking solace in the distant background, clearly obstructed by the charming trio, surprisingly solid Draco Malfoy (who just shines, especially considering his very minor roles in the past few installments) and the solemn Dumbledore.

The film is exempt of a great deal of action, and explosion enthusiasts may be turned off by such.  The effects play their part, though, complementing the performances instead of suffocating them, and are as striking as ever.

Ultimately, The Half Blood Prince has made me genuinely excited for what the end of times may hold for Harry and his friends, to the point where, even now, I cant help but feel a haunting and bittersweet twang of the heart that this epic journey is finally coming to an end.  Lord knows that, whatever happens, I'll be in line to witness all of it on day one and, come number seven, you should, too.",1324166400,,2516,4.793981481481482

3040948,4,B000ZECQ08,"While I have seen this ""Potter"" film in theaters, like all of them, it left me satisfied but a bit bewildered. Now that I've seen them all again, including this one out of sequence, things are falling into place. This 6th film seems to be a transition film or as the industry calls it a place setter. We lose much of the action in order to set the stage verbally for what is to come. Only one new major character appears. That of Prof. Slughorn (Jim Broadbent) who is recruited by Dumbledore to return to Hogwarts. Slughorn was instrumental in the development of another student, Tom Riddle who we now know is Lord Voldemort (seen only as a menacing cloud). We also see the conflict within Severus Snape (Alan Rickman who continues to impress). Is he really such a bad guy?? Dumbledore lays it all out for Harry. Specifically Harry is The Chosen One and the only hope against Lord V. (yes they use his name in this film). Harry must find the 7 pieces of the Horcrux that contain Lord V's soul and destroy them. I think they get 3 in this movie but one might be a fake. Never mind, now I'm confused again. In a more frivolous segment, we continue to see our 3 heroes mature. For the first time (I think), Harry kisses Ginny but hey, there's just no chemistry there...sorry. We also see that Hermione has a jealous streak about goofy Ron having a fling with a ""fangirl"". I don't see that relationship either. Still, it's fun and gives a break from the ominous tone of the primary story. While this episode is not the best it is highly suspenseful and may be the most important from a plot perspective. It sets everything up for a great conclusion.",1318896000,,1645,4.432343234323432

3040959,4,B000ZECQ08,"This was an impressive movie! So far my favorite-visually of the series. I've really enjoyed the HP films Yates has done. They're beautiful! I'm disappointed so many reviews declare their loathing of Yates as director. This leads me to question whether they understand what directors actually do... Anyway.

The book to me was rather slow paced and at times tedious (but still enjoyable). I felt the movie could be equally slow paced but I believe that was because of what they chose to add compared to what they got rid of:

Added:
-Cafe scene (aka: Harry is a player... not.)
-Too much Ron/humor time in the beginning (as much as I enjoyed both)
-Bellatrix and Death Eaters attacking the Burrow

Got rid of:
-Dursleys versus Dumbledore
-Snape and Harry's interactions
-Awesome Voldemort/Tom Riddle memories
-Ginny and Harry's relationship development
-Harry being a jerk about Malfoy (while he was correct, I was glad they made Harry's character less of a jerk, to put it nicely)
-Bill and Fleur (and Mrs. Weasley) (When Fleur and Mrs. Weasley make up at the end)
-The original Tom Riddle actor (from CoS) (although, understandable after so many years..)

These changes both helped the movie along and confused the heck out of everyone. I had finished the book about an hour before watching this movie, and I was still a bit unsure of the logic. I give this movie 4 stars, however, because of the quality of the cinematography, special effects, and acting.

3040964,5,B000ZECQ08,"I took a break from the Harry Potter movies after I saw the fourth, which I believe was one of the worst movies I have seen in some time. I find the book itself to be perhaps the weakest of the series (at least in its contribution to the seven-book narrative), and the film adaptation seemed more interested in simply realizing as many scenes in the book as possible rather than creating a coherent story.

After seeing the Deathly Hallows movies, however, I decided to view movies five and six to see if David Yates did as brilliant a job as he did with book seven. He did. With Order of the Phoenix and Half-Blood Prince he was not afforded the luxury of a two-part release, but these films are nevertheless excellent films.

Fans of the series complain that Yates acted as a rather poor surgeon on the book, using a meat cleaver to ineptly amputate scenes from Rowling's book. These fans miss the point. The Harry Potter movies are designed as summer blockbusters, not as realizations of the books. The movies must merely capture the essence of the book, and present the plot as coherently as possible. I believe Yates to be the only Potter director to understand this. When this concept is understood, I think disappointed fans will find that many scenes they thought they lost actually ARE in the film. I will give but one example:

There is no opening scene between the two ministers.

True, but what, really, was the point of this scene? As a Muggle, the Prime Minister offered those readers not obsessed with everything Potter to get a nice crash course in all things Wizard. In a film, we really do not have time to re-explain what has already been covered in five films. The other point of this scene was to show how Voldemort's rising power affects Muggles and Wizards alike. Do we really need Rowling's clunky dialogue between two men in an office to show this? Film is a visual medium, and the collapse of the pedestrian bridge over the Thames brilliantly depicts the terror growing in the non-Wizarding world.

If you're looking for the books, go to your bookshelf and read them. Half-Blood Prince is an excellent movie that not only captures the spirit of the book, but is also re-watchable. Highly recommended.",1313366400,,2226,4.653944020356234

3040976,3,B000ZECQ08,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was directed by David Yates and released in theatres on July 15, 2009. It was released on DVD December 08, 2009. The movie stars Danielle Radcliffe (Harry Potter), Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) and Emma Watson (Hermione Granger) as the young trio of friends attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
Since the murder of Sirius Black and the escape of the Death Eaters from Azcaban Prison, no one is safe. Wizards, witches and muggles alike are being terrorized by the Death Eaters and their seemingly misguided dedication to Lord Voldemort. When professor Albus Dumbledore once again asks Harry Potter for his help, the search begins for a missing memory that is key to Voldemort's existence and also to his destruction.
While searching for the missing memory, Harry inadvertently comes across a 'potions book' once owned by The Half-Blood Prince, but who is he? A series of vicious attacks aimed at the now aging Dumbledore prompt Harry, Hermione and Ron to search out the Half-Blood Prince and try, yet again to uncover the one thing that will rid the wizardry world of Voldemort forever. But they will suffer great loss along the way and no one will be the same after they find what they seek.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is, of course, visually stunning and yet I found myself wanting more as the credits rolled. This is not the Harry PotterI have grown to expect and the supporting character's rolls were dull and lackluster. The lead characters did do their very best to save the film and it is for that reason, and that reason alone that I long to see the two final movies.
I must say that I was slightly disappointed by this film, however my children enjoyed it immensely. I am quite sure that lovers of the Harry Potter series will want to see The Half Blood Prince, as they should, in order to continue on with the series' storyline. I can only hope that the next Harry Potter movie doesn't leave me asking 'What Happened?' and that the story I have grown to love returns to the big screen. I am sadly giving Harry Potter and the Half -Blood Prince a 3-star rating and am doing so in hopes of better things to come. Please Harry, don't let me down!

I didn't hate it either, but there were many changes from the book (emissions & additions) that really upset me and many other fans.
One thing I will say (to people that have read Yates's bashing comments) about the direction & production is:
1-STOP bashing on David Yates (director) people... He did not ruin the movie! He's only the director not the screenwriter (who adapts the book 2 screen version)
2-Too many unnecessary changes to the screen version that omitted the real action of the book
3-Although I'm not a fan of David Yates, he's a decent director and did a great job in the final movies (Deadly Hallows 1 & 2)
4-STOP BASHING ON DAVID YATES... If anything, hate & yell at Steven Kloves who's the one that writes the scripts. Also yell & complaint to JK Rowling for allowing the changes to the book... NOT DAVID YATES!!!

3040983,3,B000ZECQ08,"I have 2 main things to say about this film.  One is a comment on the screenplay/story, basically what the director and screenwriter chose to put on the screen.  The other is about the actual product, that is, the DVD itself.

First, when you have a great story to film, why go to the trouble to create another one?  Of course some things needed to be left out, the book is simply too big to fit into a standard-length film.  A judicious pruning was required.  Which makes it all the more incredible that the writer and director decided to add scenes they invented in their heads that are nowhere in the book, squandering valuable time that could have been used to tell more of the ""real"" story, you know the one that millions of us have read and loved.  About what was left out and what was, inexplicably, added, others have said much and I'm not going to repeat any of that here.  Absolutely baffling.  I can't figure out what the director and writer were thinking.

Meanwhile, I have a beef with what I guess you would call the cinematography, or at least the way the film was transferred to DVD.  Yes, the story is a ""dark"" one, and it's getting darker book by book, but why does the picture have to be so dark that a viewer can barely see what's going on.  Something is wrong here.  This isn't atmospheric; it's claustrophobic.  I would like to be able to SEE what I'm watching, please.

I would love to have rated this DVD 5 stars, and there is much to like, for example, the ending is certainly suitably dramatic, but these issues have forced my rating of the DVD down to the 3 star level.",1310601600,11,1596,4.36271186440678

The movie iself looks and sounds as good as it did in theaters.  Also most of the special features are in HD as well.  Did I say special features?  This 2 disc set contains over six hours of special features too numerous to list.  Movie lovers that are not necessarily fans of the series will be thrilled with the numerous insights into the film-makers' process.
  For true fans the set contains a fifty page book, two Harry Potter series trading cards and a lenticular card(what used to be called holograms) front cover.  This is one of the most thorough special editions I've seen.  Everything included was of a fine quality and the film comes with the addition of a digital copy, this seems to be the status quo lately thanks to the ipod phenomenon, that can be downloaded to your computer and taken in on the go.

3041006,5,B000ZECQ08,"What people need to understand is that it ISN'T UP TO WARNER BROS or the Company that releases films on DVD/BD to include a director's cut!! They can't just make up an extended version by cobbling togetehr deleted scenes and include it on the disc. The original DIRECTOR of the films has to be commissioned by the Production studio to come back and essentially re-edit the film and create a new transfer, essentially creating a new version.

Most director's don't have time for this process. Chris Columbus was able to because, as of late, he doesn't seem as busy and the subsequent directors. David Yates has been busy creating the momumentally epic conclusion to this series and unfortunately, that didn't allow him the time to come up with director's extended cuts in time for the studio's release dates for 5 and 6.

As for 3 and 4, there NEVER WAS any director's extended cuts, as the director's of those films stated that what was released in theatres was their intended vision. David Yates may have meant to include more, but ultimately he never was able to make time as he has a wonderful final installment to get made.

Read the books, watch the deleted scenes and shut up! These are still ULTIMATE COLLECTOR'S EDITIONS because each contains the ONLY VERSION of 3,4,5 and 6 that exist. If you want extended cuts, become a director, do a remake and then see how easy it is to fight the studio in charge of theatrical distribution. THEY control the money and the decisions. Different entity than the distributors for the home video editions. Warner Bro's has done a wonderful things by giving us these editions to cherish.

First two came out, had a few minutes each of extra footage and we were excited for the rest to come out. I wasn't too surprised there was only a little extra in 1 & 2 since the books were tiny as well. I was very disappointed when the release of 3 & 4 had no extra footage. As the books got bigger, more and more of the story was left out. Many of us, undoubtedly were excited about seeing more of the books brought to life. Take ""Goblet of Fire"" for example. We all read the play-by-play of the Quidditch Cup and I, for one, would have loved to have seen more of the game in action. Or how about Quidditch being cancelled in OOTP, maybe when they learn to apparate, etc... Too many things we were anticipating in the extended versions are disheartening to know we'll never see.

I had planned on purchasing the Ultimate Editions for movies 3-8 as they became available but I see no reason to spend the extra money on a little bit more bonus content.  Yes, they will still get my money, but not as much (and I'm sure I'm not the only one that feels this way). As it stands I can upgrade my standard dvd's to blu-ray for $10 each (already have Deathly Hallows on Blu-Ray) as opposed to the $30 for each Ultimate Edition.

The transfer on Blu-ray is rather soft, but not in any way out of being a bad transfer; it is simply the way the film was intended to look, apart from some slight artifacts in dark spots. I think it's rather gorgeous myself. The film forsakes some of the finer points of the book in order to keep a more palpable rhythm and mood that make this by far the most emotionally intense of the Potter experiences. The film stands on its own as a great piece, regardless of how close it is to the book. Everything that was abridged was done so with class and reason that only helps to streamline the Potter story into one of greater emotional depth and slightly faster plot development for its transfer into the film medium. Highly Recommended.

3041019,3,B000ZECQ08,"I love the Potter movies but this one just seemed like a badly abridged version of the book. Maybe it is because Half Blood Prince is the first Potter book I read and the book is bound to be better than the movies, but I don't think that is the case here. Voldemort's childhood and how Dumbledore uses the pensive to travel back in time to see his parents and then meet the young boy at the orphanage himself was just amazingly fleshed out and detailed, capitvating and descriptive in the book. Reading through how Voldemort came to be was fascinating and it allowed the audience to grasp the troubled past he endured, the darkness he exhumed and the demons that haunted him so early on eventually rendering him the person he became. There is suddenly an entire human side to Voldemort never seen before and that was powerful. But the movie missed through all these details and just rushed through it. The lake scene was pretty cool - but again in the book it was just so much more eerie than in the movie. I don't think anyone who hasn't read the book will truly understand the artistic mastery that went into creating this work of art; and it really is a work of art: Rowlings outdid herself on this one. I was captivated until the last word and i don't like fiction books.

They should have made this movie into two parts, just like with The Deathly Hollows. I must I admit I still liked it because I love Harry Potter and the visualization of the world of Harry Potter, but I think they could have done a much better job on this one especially because now, after reading all the Potter books, I believe The Half Blood Prince is THE best book in the series.

The ongoing character development of our familiar friends has come through loud and clear; especially the interactions among Harry, Hermoine, Ron and Ginny. The characterization of Professor Slughorn was spot-on and the usual high caliber acting of all the 'faculty' was quite welcome when you consider the length of this saga and the tendency for actors to become overly familiar with their respective roles. My only criticism of this movie was the fight that lead up to Dumbledore's death...the book was much more exciting and I was somewhat let down by the movie.

I ABSOLUTELY AGREED 100% WITH EVERYONE ELSE ABOUT THE EXTENDED CUT!

I own every single Harry Potter film on DVD, and when I finally got a Blue Ray Player a few years ago, I decided that if I would update my copies of the Harry Potter films to Blu Ray, that I might as well wait and get the ""Ultimate"" Editions because they would contain the Extended Cuts...  And so I purchased ""Sorcerer's Stone"" and ""Chamber of Secrets"" Ultimate Editions instead of the regular Blu Ray editions (Which are much cheaper) mostly because of the Extended Cuts.  This was the biggest selling point and the main reason to get the Ultimate Editions.

Then they release ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" and ""Goblet of Fire"" in Ultimate Editions but with no Extended Cuts.  They messed up on that because by doing that they are automatically taking away the one incentive that makes it an ""Ultimate"" Edition.  Now you're just ripping people off by giving out the same product in a fancier and more expensive packaging.

When ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" and ""Goblet of Fire"" Ultimate Editions came out last year without the Extended Cuts, Warner Bros. made the excuse that this was supposedly because the original Directors of the films didn't want to go back and re-edit a Director's Cut, and so they decided to respect their wishes.

That said, I was hoping that David Yates, the Director of ""Order of the Phoenix"" and ""Half-Blood Prince"" would be able to do the Extended Cuts since he is technically still working on the films.  So the whole Director excuse to me is complete BS.

Way to go Warner Bros.!!!

There's a lot of talk about how fans should be excited about these new releases. But there are two words missing from the descriptions of both these products: Extended Cut.

What sold me and so many other fans was the extended cuts. And so I began collecting the Ultimate Editions. And what excited me even more was the idea of more extended cuts to come, especially for The Order of the Phoenix.

Then Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblit of fire Ultimate Editions came out, and of course, there were no extended cuts. And Warner Bros. spun us a tale of directors and their creative preferences. And so, we all said ""fair enough"" (although I, for one, never quite bought that explanation). Still, I had hopes for Order of the phonex and Half blood prince. Director David Yates is on record talking about having to cut 45 minutes from The Order of the Phoenix. And yet, here we are again with no extended cut to speak of. I'm sure the studio will spin us a tale of how busy Yates has been with the final installment of the franchise, thus making it impossible to return to these previous films and give the fans what they want,AN EXTENDED CUT.

I understand Warner Bros. desire to get these editions on the shelves before the final film hits theaters. As for me, I would gladly wait a year for these editions if it meant getting to see extended cuts of the films. But this is not about the fans. This is about the bottom line. If the WB can get a half-@$$ product onto the shelves sooner, and therefore presumably make more money in the final season of Potter movie mania, then who cares what the fans want? We will buy anything with the word Ultimate in front of it. Or maybe not.",1300147200,8,1845,4.468842729970326
3041037,5,B000ZECQ08,"Why that title? Because OOP and GOF both left me too many questions about what was going on during the movie since I have not read the books. What I feel were important scenes (for us who have not read all the books) key to understanding the flow of the story were left out in those two movies ... especially in OOP, which left me totally confused.

This, thank goodness, is not the case in HBP. The opening scenes in the film clearly establish its tie to the previous movie (Order of the Phoenex) and all sequences within the story follow upon one another ... although I am a little confused about how Snape's potion's book came to be in the cupboard at school and why it was deemed to be so much of a problem that Harry and Ginny decided to hide it away where no one, including Harry, could ever find it again. The book probably explains this a bit, but then, I haven't read the book.

The acting, as always, is superb and enjoyable. The characterization of Horace Slughorn adds immeasurably to the story. He is complex and yet very simple and easy to understand. He is very human as well .. and has some interesting quirks about him.

I was a little surprised to find out that Snape was the half-blood prince and do not understand the importance of the title or how he manages to have it. But this does not detract from the movie at all. Matter of fact, it's not mentioned until the last minutes of the film and was never really a question to be answered during the length of the flick.

The ending of the movie is certainly a surprise (I won't ruin it here for those who may not have seen the film and haven't read anything on the Internet) and was a bit put out. However, in reading more on the up and coming two part movie, The Deathly Hallows, one finds out that the person they think is a rogue and traitor is not that at all. Anyway, it's a jaw-dropper.

Technically, the DVD is as good as any made today. The picture and colors are clear and bright, the audio is free from noise or hiss and is immently understandable, and there are extras on the DVD for those that like some background to the story itself.

All in all, a fine addition to the ongoing serial of Harry Potter. I shall be very disappointed to see the series end with the release of Deathly Hallows, Part II. But then, the adventures can't go on forever. Additionally, both the concept (by Ms Rowlings) and the films have given us a fine bit of film making and story telling that we may enjoy again and again throughout the years.

Definately recommended for all ages.

Did Warner Bros add neww things to their ultimate HP movie sets? Yes!!! What do you call the eight hour documentary spread all over all eight ultimate editions? This is what clearly sets the Ultimate Editions apart from their standard DVD, and original Blu_Ray DVD releases. In my opinion the eight hour documentary is one of the most original speical features concepts available on Blu_Ray or any DVD for that matter. As a plus you also get most of the bonus material from the standard DVD release of OOTP, along with the material on the original BLu_Ray release, plus some of the bonus material from the long dead HD DVD release.

On the other hand, we also live in a soceity where all to often movie studios double dip without porting any of the special features from the previous editions onto the new edition. Does HP OOTP UD fall into this trap? Yes and no All of the special features from the previous releases are avaiable, with the exception of the annoying games, and the one hour segment of the eight part documentary is always fun to watch. On the flip side of the coin, extended edditions would be nice, and the price for the Ultimate editions is about $10 or $15.00 to expensive
Now are the movies perfect adaptations of the books? No But overall if you appreicate the films as being a differnt medium then the books, you can understand why some things were cut out. But even though fan favorite scenes may be left out or plot ideas not as well developed, the real treat of the eight HP movies is not how well they convey the story of the books-thats already been done by J.K Rowling-but seeing Daniel, Rupert and Emma mature as actors as their chracters mature in the books is the real treat of the movies and the eight hour documentary conveys this whole aspect of the movies really well<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-Ultimate-Edition-Blu-ray/dp/B004P9FAKW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Ultimate Edition) [Blu-ray</a>].",1299801600,15,2566,4.914746543778802
3041039,1,B000ZECQ08,"I guess I shouldn't be surprised. As you know, Warner Brothers has officially announced the Ultimate Editions of years 5 and 6. The product descriptions are quite wordy. There's a lot of talk about how fans should be excited about these new releases. But there are two words missing from the descriptions of both these products: Extended. Cut.

These are the words that sold me in the beginning. The promise of seeing extended cuts of the HP films was enough for me (and many, MANY other fans) to double dip and get the Ultimate SS and CoS Blu-rays. And you know what? There were worth it. Not because of the endless array of worthless swag packed into over-size boxes. I mean, seriously... Anybody out there framing their lenticular cards and hanging them over their mantles? I didn't think so. But I digress...

What sold me and so many other fans was the extended cuts. And so I began collecting the Ultimate Editions. And what excited me even more was the idea of more extended cuts to come, especially for The Order of the Phoenix.

Then PoA and GoF Ultimate Editions came out, and of course, there were no extended cuts. And Warner Bros. spun us a tale of directors and their creative preferences. And so, we all said ""fair enough"" (although I, for one, never quite bought that explanation). Still, I had hopes for OotP and HBP. Director David Yates is on record talking about having to cut 45 minutes from The Order of the Phoenix. And yet, here we are again with no extended cut to speak of. I'm sure the studio will spin us a tale of how busy Yates has been with the final installment of the franchise, thus making it impossible to return to these previous films and give the fans what they want: An official ultimate collector's replica of a square of Hogwart's Toilet Paper.

Oh, I meant AN EXTENDED CUT.

Now, I understand Warner Bros. desire to get these editions on the shelves before the final film hits theaters. As for me, I would gladly wait a year for these editions if it meant getting to see extended cuts of the films. But this is not about the fans. This is about the bottom line. If the WB can get a half-@$$ product onto the shelves sooner, and therefore presumably make more money in the final season of Potter movie mania, then who cares what the fans want?

3041048,4,B000ZECQ08,"SPOILERS BELOW

All right, so I've come to the conclusion that Half Blood Prince is my least favorite of the Harry Potter movies. It's not because of all the stuff that is cut from the book, but simply because it just doesn't ""draw me in"" like the other ones do. I know the first two films aren't perfect, but they both make me so happy whenever I watch them (probably because of the nostalgia). My favorites in the series are Deathly Hallows Part I, Prisoner of Azkaban, and Order of the Phoenix.

That being said, I do like Half Blood Prince. I thought Michael Gambon gave his best Dumbledore performance here, all the young actors were good, Jim Broadbent was good (really, the acting was perfectly fine). The Cave scene is hands down the best scene in the film in my opinion. Overall, though, Half Blood Prince focused too much on the comedy/romantic aspects. I was perfectly fine with the fact that Hogwarts was more ""sexified"", but it felt as though the Tom Riddle (and the Half Blood Prince story) took a back seat to it. But still, this movie has other things to offer, and it has gorgeous cinematography.

The DVD itself is really good. None of the DVDs so far have topped the Goblet of Fire DVD, which is completely stocked with great Bonus features. This DVD has some good ones, and the best one has to be the J.K. Rowling documentary. It really gives fans a deeper insight into how J.K.'s life influenced the books.

Overall, I'd say this is worth the purchase if you're a Harry Potter fan and you want some neat bonus features on your DVD. I bought it primarily to add to my collection of all the other films.",1295827200,,1622,4.469594594594595

3041060,4,B000ZECQ08,"I haven't read this book yet (I'm halfway through The Goblet of Fire), but I saw the movie in the theater and have watched it a couple of times since. Therefore, I can only comment on the film itself and can't compare it to the book. Any comparisons to previous films in the series will be based solely on the films themselves, not the books.

An important thing to know about this film is that it was directed by David Yates, the director of the final four of the eight Harry Potter films (including the forthcoming second part of The Deathly Hallows). The Order of the Phoenix was the first one he directed, and it continued the trend of increasingly darker and more adult-oriented Potter films. That approach is carried through to this film, which is more somber, moody, and dramatic than any of the previous films. Where the first five films were fanciful and fun, containing plenty of big action set pieces, THBP has a tone of sobriety brought on by the ever-growing threat of Voldemort and his Death Eaters to not only the Dumbledore-defended Hogwarts, but the Muggle and wizarding worlds at large. Without launching into a plot synopsis, I will say that the film strikes a solid balance between teen-movie-styled romantic and school drama, the broader saving-the-world mystery epic surrounding Voldemort, and a cloak-and-dagger subplot involving the Death Eaters, Snape and Draco Malfoy, resulting in the death of a certain important character. As always, there is a special-effects laden climax to this film, but it is hardly the spectacular, extensive knock-down, drag-out wizard battle of The Order of the Phoenix. However, you do get to see Dumbledore use some kick-ass magic at the end of a heart-wrenching scene during which he faces perhaps his greatest challenge ever.

If the proverbial s*** was beginning to hit the fan during the previous (TOOTP) film, it was nothing compared to the terror and despair that this film portends for Harry, Ron and Hermoine. As a matter of fact, the excellent, harrowing The Deathly Hallows Part 1 frankly blows this film out of the water in many ways, but THBP remains the best of the first six. By this point, the filmmakers and actors had deeper, more psychologically complex material to work with, not to mention lots of practice working within the logic of J.K. Rowling's world. Therefore, just about everything in this film is a step up from the previous five, which is saying something when you're talking about a film series that consistently achieves a surprisingly high level of quality across the board. The performances this time around are particularly remarkable, especially when it comes to Alan Rickman as Snape.

This review comes with a minor warning, however. If it has not already been made clear, this film is a different beast from the first five, despite it's relatively close adherence to the overall structure of those films. Many people were disappointed by the lack of action and complained that ""not much happened"". Happily, these criticisms simply miss the point - for what it is, this is an excellent film. It's not supposed to be an action blockbuster, however it may have been marketed during the summer leading up to its release. So watch this one and then enjoy the big payoff supplied by The Deathly Hallows Part 1, and, presumably, Part 2.",1293667200,,3324,4.890070921985815

First, I like that the movies are sticking closer to the events in the books.  After the debacle that was Goblet of Fire, this and The Order of the Phoenix were refreshing breaths of fresh air.  The series does take a dark turn (as it has been since the 3rd film).  Without going into the plot and events, suffice to say this film is full of surprises and shockers (for those who haven't read the book).

At $34.99 I might have cringed a bit, but the Blu-Ray transfer is very nice.  I play on a Toshiba 49"" LCD 1080p through my PS3 and it looks great.  If you already own the DVD and want to upgrade to the HD version, then I would recommend it.  Just not for the MSRP.  Wait for a better price like I did!

Movie - 5 stars
Blu-Ray Transfer - 5 stars
Extras - 4 or 5 stars (lots of extra content)

Of note:  I did not see any of the black bands that a few other reviewers mentioned.  It may have been a bad initial batch or something intermittent.

Also, this doesn't really follow the book very well, but the director is trying to pack a lot of content into a finite film length, so sometimes sacrifices must be made.

The horcruxes, another factor as to why this film is so high in my esteem, are immensely clever! They also explain quite a bit! The reasons behind the power of Tom Riddle's diary and the ring are explained by the horcrux theory. The film starts and ends with a bang, too. {SPOILER AHEAD!!!!!} Dumbledore's death was particularly horrifying and touching; it was quite sad. Something I was glad to see was that Harry, Ron, and Hermione are growing up. Ron and Hermione's affection for each other is by now very obvious, and I, for one, will be immensely joyful when they get married. {ANOTHER SPOILER!} Malfoy appears quite a bit, doing unknown deeds, adding to the suspense of the film. The visuals are great, as always. The film's ending will leave you in shock, but will make you extremely impatient to see the 7th Harry Potter film! When I first saw the film, I was stuck to my seat the entire 153 minutes! I was quite glad quidditch matches were introduced again; I missed them. Slughorn was very funny, as was Hagrid. The inferi were very scary, and young Tom Riddle was chilling. Harry and his friends are becoming more and more real, human, and lovable with each film, and this is no exception. I still think Luna Lovegood steals the show, and wish she could have been in the Half Blood Prince even longer than she was! The identity of the Half Blood Prince was shocking!!!!

3041078,2,B000ZECQ08,"HP & the Half-Blood Prince

This was one of my favorite books in the series and so I especially looked forward to the movie.  BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!  AAUUUGHH!

I waited for YEARS (!) and FIVE books anticipating the day when the Dursleys would receive their long-deserved comeuppance from Dumbledore for their poor treatment of Harry...  And WHAT HAPPENED?!

They actually FILMED the scene, and then decided (after I had anticipated it for YEARS ) that the audience didn't care enough about the books as written  to sit through such a LONG scene, and they cut it, only to replace it with an equally long  scene involving a presumptuous teenaged tart in a greasy-spoon diner: Harry hacks up a foreshortened verbal ejaculation, and she instantly presumes he was going to ask her out?!  Please...! What has been established about his character to make it plausible that he would entertain such an unlikely interest?

And the meeting between the Minister of Magic and the Muggle Minister...? ""(Cough, cough...) AHEM! ""Where did THAT go?!  It was ONLY one of the best, FAR ABOVE & BEYOND, most enjoyable and exquisitely disturbing and creepy...,  of all the scenes in all the books so far. So..., WHERE THE HELL DID IT GO?!

Which EXCESSIVELY INFLUENTIAL PERSON decided that this savory and delicious scene was not worth taking the time to watch?  And WHY do they still have a job?!

But I must say the most offensive change made from the book to the movie involved a violation of HP's character. In the book, HP used the potions book of the Half-Blood Prince to his advantage (no harm there), until he used a spell to harm another student in self-defense. Even though he used the spell innocently in self-defense, author Rowling treated it as an act of evil (with which I disagree).  But the movie takes a turn for the worse:  Harry is so uncertain of his right to self-defense in a threatening situation that he allows Ginny Weasley (portrayed most unattractively by Bonnie Wright) to substitute for his inner moral conscience, and then because he is such a weakly indecisive and spineless ""hero..."" She must take the spellbook from his hands and hide it while his eyes are closed!  This scene, by itself, suggests that Harry Potter is a moral ignoramus and coward.

The spellbook represents Knowledge, which in itself is neither good nor evil, but only as it is applied. So this scene implies that Harry is afraid of knowledge because he does not have the Wisdom and Strength of character to apply it ethically.  However I must admit that this flaw of character originates with the author Rowling, and is only amplified in the movie.

Also, Slughorn was miscast. (An actor  in Deathly Hallows Pt 1 seemed better for the part of Slughorn, but must have been too late).  Slughorn bursting from the armchair was painfully embarrassing!  Not convincing at all!  They should have at least digitized the effect! Barbara Eden smoking out of her bottle was MORE CONVINCING!..., and THAT was 4.5 DECADES ago!  You HAVEN'T come a long way, Baby..., er, Dude!!

3041082,5,B000ZECQ08,"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince opens with several Death Eaters, flying through the air while enveloped in plumes of dark mist (like the children of Lost's smoke monster), wreaking havoc in the world of muggles.  Not only do they bust up a magic shop, but they also down a bridge in London, killing untold numbers of pedestrians.  If you had any doubts that The Half Blood Prince would continue the sinister atmosphere of the previous installments, then the first few moments of the film should put those doubts to rest with a swift knock to the head.  This time out Voldemort is at full power and his minions have free reign over their world and ours.

 Each Harry Potter film contributes one piece to the overall puzzle regarding Voldemort's past and Harry's role as his Achilles heel (or would he be the arrow that can pierce the Achilles heel).  In The Half Blood Prince the new Potions professor, Horace Slughorn, holds that next piece.  Dumbledore recruits Slughorn for the upcoming school year in hopes that he will divulge a conversation he once had with Voldemort, known at the time as Tom Riddle, before his transformation into pure evil.  Slughorn views his job as more than just a teacher in a classroom.  He also establishes a coterie of young wizards and wishes who he believes it is his duty to fashion into adults.  Harkening back to an earlier time, Slughron is the type of professor who would call the special something he recognizes in these students as ""character.""  In a bit of espionage, Harry must creep his way underneath Slughorn's wing in hopes to uncover the secret conversation.

This time around, the melodrama of high school dating is pushed to the forefront, but unlike in previous films these aren't moments the viewer must endure to get to the world of magic but rather enjoyable in their own right.  The appeal of the Harry Potter series has always been its marriage of fantastical adventure with the everyday drama of grade school.  But until The Half Blood Prince the quotidian half of that equation has always paled in comparison to the otherworldly.  One of the joys of this lengthy series of films has been the evolution of the three main actors from passable children stars to the ideal embodiment of their characters.  The Half Blood Prince also provides all three actors some great ensemble and individual moments to work with.  Much of the high school plotline stems from a love triangle between Hermione, Ron and Ron's new squeeze Lavender.  Just as Hermione has come to realize her feelings for Ron, he has found someone new.  (Although, I just can't picture those two getting old together.  I imagine Ron wearing a wife beater in front of the television while Hermione fetches him another Natty Light from the fridge).  Harry, likewise, reaches the age where he's ready to start dating, but has yet to recognize Ginny Weasley's longtime crush on him.

Perhaps the most ingenious aspect of The Half Blood Prince is how the minutia of high school life becomes a major plot point.  We all remember the used textbooks that were seemingly passed down from time immemorial and filled with scribbling, often obscene, of different penmanship.  Well, Harry discovers one such used textbook for his Potions class that contains perfections on even the textbook's recipes as well as some other magical tips.  As a reader, I absolutely love the central place books take in the world of Harry Potter, from Tom Riddle's diary to the importance of the library (Hogwarts just wouldn't be Hogwarts if they had the internet).  As a blockbuster children's author, J.K. Rowlings appears to be establishing physical books as objects of value that are just as magical as any spell or potion.

The Half Blood Prince is the film where all of the elements of a Harry Potter film--the ingenious magic spells, the battle between forces of good and evil, the childhood romance--all finally come together, like a supernatural potion, into a perfect brew.  The genius of J.K. Rowling is that, instead of writing sequels for a new wave of eight year olds every other year, she let her books mature with her audience, allowing her characters, plot and prose all grow along with the children who may have read the first book when they were even younger than Harry in his first adventure.  In The Half Blood Prince, for example, the character of Draco Malfoy, who had always been a nasty little pipsqueak, must decide whether he is more loyal to Hogwarts or to the Death Eaters.  In earlier installments it was always clear that Draco served as one of the villains, but as the stakes have risen, even the more wicked characters have trouble contending with the consequences or their actions.

Likewise, with each installment the films have displayed stunning visual complexity to match the emotional density.  And the visuals for The Half Blood Prince are perhaps some of the best of the series.  The director, David Yates, utilizes the byzantine angles of Hogwarts castle to cut and dissect the space between multiple characters, illustrating the levels of intrigue that are simultaneously occurring at the expansive Hogwarts compound.  The framing owes much to Shekhar Kapur's Elizabeth, another film that takes place within the cold confines of a castle.  The color palate of the film mimics a daguerreotype tan, giving the movie an atemoporal timelessness.  The world of Hogwarts has always been a bricolage of differing time periods, combining medieval signifiers, like wizards and castles, with memorabilia from the 1940s.  To move from the world of the muggles to the world of magic is as much a movement in time as it is a movement in space.

It is often cited as a critical truism that The Prisoner of Azkaban is the best of the series (although, this is not necessarily the case for fans of the book).  I can understand why so many critics make this assertion, and The Prisoner of Azkaban is indeed one of the top films of the series, but I truly believe that The Half Blood Prince takes the prize for the best film in the franchise.  Azkaban is a success for two reasons: 1) it was the first instance of a textual and emotional maturation of the series and 2) the film stripped away much of the grade school drama that had gummed up the works in past installments, making the first Harry Potter film that felt like a large scale blockbuster, even if its running time was slightly shorter.  The reason why The Half Blood Prince is an even better film than The Prisoner of Azkaban is because instead of hiding from some of the soap opera elements of past installments, the film chose to strengthen those aspects of the story, making the viewer just as concerned with who Harry might end up dating as they are with whether or not Harry and Dumbledore will find the correct enchanted object to stop Voldemort.  With the sixth film in the series, director David Yates has finally positioned Harry Potter as a fantasy world of cinema to be considered alongside the likes of The Wizard of Oz, The Lord of the Rings, and The Princess Bride.  You might disagree with whether or not these films deserve a place next to these esteemed films, but as the series draws to a close it is impossible to ignore their place within the genre of fantasy.",1290816000,3,7262,4.771382893685052
3041083,2,B000ZECQ08,"Very good acting and direction; tight comedy cutting, without a doubt; very funny script; special effects - goes without saying.

This Reviewer is not a HP fan or a fan of grandiose tales of magic and suspense and so this film/DVD left me wondering if cogent storytelling natuarlly plays a distant second to all the high-tech. wizardry to dazzle the eye but not inspire the mind - I have never witnessed a plotline which seemed intent on snowballing into total incoherence. Every couple of scenes we get an explanation of what we just saw. I thought Maggie Smith, as one of the School's Administrator's, would clear up some of my confusion.

Maybe it's a formula I'm not used to - a genre of the ""video game"" generation where action and effects are the raison d'etre? But that teenage girl ghost, ""living"" in the school girl's room, who disappears into the commode has me totally baffled. I don't recall anything like that in the Hardy Boys books I read when I was nine or in the Nancy Drew books I didn't read. (No sexism intended).

I surmise Harry is conceived as a somewhat genderless hero - don't recall any scenes where he makes a fist or snarls at his adversaries. He waves his wand and the bad guys go flying in all directions. Never raises his voice above a whisper. I wasn't expecting the Dead End Kids Meet The Troll People but this kid just might benefit from a summer job in a Lumber yard.",1290816000,,1402,4.511811023622047
3041084,4,B000ZECQ08,"As Harry Potter and his friends begin their sixth year at Hogwarts, darkness shadows them everywhere.  It seems that every scene takes place either at night or in some dim and threatening setting.  Even the school itself is no longer the island of safety it once was.  And although Harry and Dumbledore have managed to convince the wizarding world that Lord Voldemort has indeed returned, that fact alone is enough to make life much more perilous for our young hero.  While Dumbledore tries to discover what Voldemort's weakness may be and provides Harry with special tutoring to prepare him for the inevitable confrontation, Harry struggles to deal with the eternal teenage verities of love and the choice of career--but always with his enemy's lurking presence as his major focus.  A mysterious Potions text labelled ""property of the Half-Blood Prince"" proves pivotal to the story, and as the film approaches its conclusion, changes and revelations come thick and fast.

Like its two immediate predecessors, and probably inevitably, the sixth Harry movie loses something in translation from print, since the increasingly complex books can't be wholly transferred to film.  Indeed, disappointingly, although we do learn the identity of the Prince in the end, there are no details given as to why he called himself that, so curious viewers will definitely have to crack the book if they haven't done so already.

3041085,5,B000ZECQ08,"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince begins on a real somber note. The opening scene, only mentioned but not described in the book, shows Death Eaters causing the destruction of a massive bridge filled with people. What makes this scene unique compared to the rest of the series is that this destruction takes place in the muggle world, not the wizarding one. David Yates, directing his second Harry Potter film, takes great pains to show that there are no safe places now that Voldemort is back and his followers are out in the open. Even some places that were safe havens for Harry in the past, namely the Weasley residence and even Hogwarts itself, are besieged by Death Eaters.

However, the danger surrounding the characters at every turn doesn't keep the teen characters from being teens. Hormones run high through Hogwarts as students pair off and young love blooms. Things may be dark, but in the world of Harry Potter there will always be some light shining through. While some people complained that there was too much young love in this film, I have to admit that I found it interesting that more than ever this film really gave an impression that the teens in Harry Potter are just ordinary (well, for wizards) kids who happen to find themselves in extraordinary situations. As a result, this film is not only the darkest film of the series, it's also the funniest.

While rumors swirled that some cast members would not find their way back for the sixth Potter film (Emma Watson was considering dropping out and Tom Felton, who plays Draco Malfoy, had previously made comments that he would not make it to the end of the series), the cast remained intact for Half Blood Prince. Nine years and six films is a long time for a cast to stay together, especially when they're as young as most of this cast was when the series began, so the fact that they're still together is beyond amazing.

The Harry Potter team continues its casting coup in Half Blood Prince. Royal Shakespeare Company veteran Helen McCrory (Becoming Jane, Enduring Love), who was initially cast as Bellatrix LeStrange in Order of the Phoenix but had to drop out due to pregnancy, joins the cast as Lestrange's sister Narcissa Malfoy. The cast member that everyone was talking about, though, was Oscar winner Jim Broadbent (Iris, Hot Fuzz) as Horace Slughorn. At the time of Half Blood Prince's release everyone expected Broadbent to get at least a nomination for Best Supporting Actor, and, while he didn't get nominated, he delivered the best performance the series has known. In fact, all the actors in the series give their best performance to date in this film. Even Michael Gambon finally gets Dumbledore right!

It's also great to see Quidditch back in the series after being noticeably absent from the last two films and just barely present in Prisoner of Azkaban. The sequences are shot better than in the first two films, and depict the game as much more brutal, having more in common with rugby than it appeared to before. The addition of Ron to Gryffindor's team is brilliant. I'm also glad that we get to see more of Alan Rickman's Severus Snape than in previous installments. In Goblet of Fire, besides a few speaking lines, he was relegated to a moment of physical comedy with Harry and Ron, and he was barely present in Order of the Phoenix.

While Half Blood Prince didn't quite catch up to Order of the Phoenix in box office receipts, it's still the third-highest grossing film in the series and was the second-highest grossing film of 2009 with $936 million earned worldwide. According to Rotten Tomatoes, this installment of Harry Potter is ranked the third highest, critically-speaking. It seems a lot of critics felt as though this film worked more as a placeholder in the series than as a standalone film. That criticism isn't too far from the truth, yet J.K. Rowling said that this is the best film based on her books yet.",1290556800,3,3927,4.743777452415813

3041087,3,B000ZECQ08,"Through five previous films, this title, and two more to go, we've watched our little friends and the actors who portray them grow up before our eyes!  This, in itself, has made the series fun and enjoyable.  I read the books, and enjoyed the previous film adaptations, but this was the first film I left the theater disappointed.

The original film tried to pack every detail from the book into its already lengthy running time, resulting in a breakneck pace that gave the viewer little time to really hone in on the characters.  The following two films, in my opinion the pinnacle of the film series, found just the right beat, with few sacrifices.  The fourth film, based as it was on a book three times longer, still managed to bring a fantastic adaptation, even with drastic amounts of material cut. The fifth film, Order of the Phoenix, was the first I thought should have been better, even while subsequent viewings have made me appreciate it all the more.

But now, the sixth film in the series, I found myself for the first time really feeling disappointed as I left the theater, feeling like the whole thing was a waste of time.  My second viewing, here on DVD, went much better, yet I STILL feel the end of this film is a huge letdown.

The key to enjoying these latter films is divorcing them completely from the books.  If you overlook the glaring amount of material missing and just take them as their own creations, they are quite enjoyable.  Bearing that in mind, for the purpose of this review, I will not be referring to the book anymore - that approach is already done to death here.  The book is the book, the movie is the movie. Yet even with this tactic, HALF-BLOOD PRINCE, comes up short.

The film begins with Harry meeting Horace Slughorn, the new potions professor, who Dumbledore wants Harry to get close to in order to retrieve a secret memory regarding Voldemort's days at Hogwarts.  With this information, Dumbledore hopes to reveal the Dark Lord's weakness to aid in the coming final battle.  This, in a nutshell, is the thrust of the film. The first two-thirds contain all the usual charm and fun we've come to enjoy in the series.  Best of all, the content has matured with the characters, so the humor is not nearly so childish, nor are the themes.  There are some truly terrifying images in this film (particularly a disturbing near death experience encountered by one of the female students midway through).  The majority of the film, in other words, works quite well.

The problem is twofold:  firstly, at this point Ron and Hermione are nearly side characters, whose scenes come and go quickly, as though getting them out of the way.  The story is now focused almost solely on Harry's quest to overcome Voldemort.  This leaves little for Ron and Hermione to do but get embroiled in romance problems in the background. Other beloved characters, such as Hagrid, Crabbe and Goyle, Neville, and the Phoenix members are reduced to mere cameos.  Some, like the Durselys, are wholly absent.

The larger problem, though, comes in the film's final conflict.  Whereas ORDER OF THE PHOENIX built to one of the most jaw-droppingly awesome moments in the entire franchise, the finale of this film was markedly less exciting.  Without giving too much away, we learn that one student's entire year came down to setting one series of events into motion, yet we never really see what was so vital in what he was doing.  When it comes down to it, the deed needing to be done is carried out by someone who was already at Hogwarts all along.

Furthermore, when we learn who the titular ""half-blood prince"" is, it's almost an afterthought.  The character literally says, ""yes, I'm the half-blood prince"" and then walks off the scene.  No follow up, no conversation about what this means and why its important.  It's a tremendously weak moment in an overwhelmingly weak ending.  Worst of all, unlike the previuos films, we are left with no real concluding moment - just more of a ""to be continued"" style ending, much like the FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS ending.  Perhaps the concluding films will make up for this, but as it stands, the film is almost completely undone by this underwhelming ending.

To compound matters, the image quality is horrendous.  The film itself was lit and graded very darkly, but coupled with Warner Bros. typically shoddy transfer, and you are left with a badly artifacted, dark, and dreary image most of the way through.

At the end of the day, even with a lackluster ending, I still enjoyed the film, even if it stands currently as the weakest in the series (to be fair, the book is also my least favorite).  Coupled with the poor image, its hard to endorse this product.  I feel generous giving it three stars, but that is totally due to the quality of the actors, music, effects, and direction.  Thankfully, these areas still stand firm!",1290384000,,4882,4.7
3041088,3,B000ZECQ08,"It's unfortunate that this ended up being such a disappointing installment in the series because at times it's so promising. Director David Yates definitely seems to have been the biggest fan of the books of any director who has made a HP movie, and this is incredibly well made. The amount of detail in here and the way this wizarding world is brought to life is pretty stunning. Half Blood Prince is the 4th shortest book of the series as well, which has given the filmmakers time to include almost all the major events of the book.

...almost. Then you get to the final act, which is as big an example of ""dropping the ball"" I think I've ever seen. But I'll get to that. Half Blood Prince was, in my opinion, one of the least-interesting books of the series. It featured tons and tons of flashbacks and aside from that, not all that much happening. It was loaded with teen romance and honestly I can't stand that stuff. I actually give the filmmakers credit for trimming a lot of this out. We got just the right amount of Voldemort flashbacks, we got ...still a little too much romance, but it was at least not as unbearably annoying as it was in the book. Where the book Half Blood Prince amazed, though, was its ending. The last few chapters were some of the most intense, powerful, and surprising in the entire series. And unfortunately, the filmmakers seemed to have butchered them at every opportunity. Just when scenes like the one inside the cave begin to get even remotely exciting, they abruptly cut away. The scene on top of the tower totally lacked the intensity it needed, and the performances of two key actors in this scene....what were they thinking? The confrontation down at the cabin, same thing....I don't understand what the filmmakers hoped to achieve with this scene as it was shot, but it doesn't make any sense, emotionally. The story's big reveal is then handled so casually (and with no explanation whatsoever) that it's almost laughable.

A main character does die in this film, and the amount of weight this is given is almost mindbogglingly small. Again, what were they thinking?

The entire book built up to its final chapters. The movie attempts to as well, but unfortunately, this ""final part"" was butchered almost to the point of irrelevance. These ""intense"" final moments are so low-key that it almost feels like the actors are sleepwalking. Half Blood Prince is a good movie as you're watching it, and I found myself enjoying it, but then the last 15-20 minutes happen, and the movie just ends and you're left feeling, ""....that's it?""",1290211200,2,2573,4.700665188470066

3041090,2,B000ZECQ08,"Watching Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince, is like listening to a children's choir where all the children are a little off key. Each Harry Potter contains a lot more material then can be put into a movie. The difficulty is choosing what to put into the movie and then sanding over the parts you miss. As the novels have gotten larger, the job of the film makers has gotten more difficult. However, up until this point they have done a reasonably good job of finding a rhythm that works in telling the broader story (even if it is a little different then that of JK Rowlings).
With this film it feels like they didn't know what direction they were going in and ended up trying to do too much, but ended up not doing enough. Characters like Hagrid and Prof Mcgonagall who played larger roles in earlier movies are now just given cameos. It might have been better had they just left the characters out entirely so they could create a less fragmented story line without as many distractions. They also spent way too much time on Quidditch (which JK Rowling even said she only put in for the fans) and the teen romances.
This wouldnt have mattered if they had not glimpsed over key areas. 1) They spent so little time explaining the significance of the potions book, to the point that most of the people that didn't read the book had no idea who the half blood prince was after the movie. 2) They left out most of the lessons that Harry had with Dumbledore and shortened the ones they did show. These lessons are so key to book 7, I hope that the audience will be able to follow along.
There seemed to be some bad casting with the Prof Slughorn and the young Tom Riddle characters. Each year a new colorful character is brought in for the DATDO teacher. Lockhart, Moody, and Umbridge in particular are some of the most colorful characters I know of and have provided ample material for the movies. Slughorn shouldn't be any different. Slughorn should come off as a sort of 19th century politician or aristocrat. He should be round, proud, jolly, but also cunning. Instead he is thin, aloof, and awkward. I wonder if Jim Broadbent has read and loved these books, or if he is simply looking for another notch on the resume and paycheck in the bank account. Then Tom Riddle was played like the kid from the Omen. Noone would ever believe this kid was anything other then trouble and he does not seem that clever. I thought that Christian Coulson in the Chamber of Secrets really captured tom riddle better as charming, handsome, and mature.
Finally, I have to admit that it isn't just the new actors. All of the actors were off key. Even the main trio and seasoned actors like Michael Gambon who have played brilliantly in previous movies felt flat. It is almost like they are tired of the movies. I just hope that the seventh and eighth film show more heart, because these actors will never get another opportunity.",1289779200,,2914,4.510396975425331

David Yates and his crew ruined this movie and I can't believe he will make the next ones too.

This made the pacing of the movie seem sluggish at times.

Some of the dialogue was also weird and the non-urgency of Hagrid and Snape in the cursed necklace and Sectumsempra scenes, respectively, was off-putting.

But the best acting of the young stars (with the exception of Bonnie Wright) can be found here, particularly: Tom Felton, Dan (especially in the Felix Felicis scene), Rupert (with his comedic timing), and Emma (with the canary scene being a highlight). And the soundtrack behind this movie is my favorite.

All in all, this is my third favorite Harry Potter movie so far (behind Prisoner of Azkaban and Order of the Phoenix).",1285718400,2,884,4.802631578947368

This review is a warning regarding the digital copy code that was originally advertised with this disc, but no longer available to current buyers.  Unlike many of the other Blu-Ray discs I have purchased with digital copy codes, this disc came by far the shortest timeframe for using the code before it expires.  While many BD discs come with a 1-year, 2-year or indefinite time to use the code, this movie came with a code that only lasted 6 months.  Worst still, at the time of the writing of this review, the Half-Blood Prince movie is not available for digital download from iTunes, so this was the only opportunity I had to load it onto my iPod Touch.

I've never really been interested by the somewhat flimsy plots nor engaged by the characters. There's something parochial about them, partly because so much of each movie is set in or around Hogwarts. In fairness, however, none of these limitations are likely to bother the target audience. Half Blood Prince is yet again set mostly in the school for the magically gifted but this time the story manages, to some extent, to surpass what has gone before. The plot is fuller than in the previous episodes, and the familiar characters are growing up, thus giving scope for them be fleshed out -- suddenly they're much more interesting to us older viewers. The acting has also improved over the years -- even Daniel Radcliffe has lost most of his woodenness.

I have all the sound turned all the way up.  Every other sound is great on my machine except the blu ray movie sound.  Second, and it may not be a real problem, this movie ended rather anticlimactically.  It felt like ""OK, it's over, ""insert the final minute of what is seen"" and then ""boom"" with no closure.  I assume, being one of the few people that never read the books, that that will not be a problem because whatever is happening as it ends will make sense after the final two movies.

-Alan Rickman as Snape is just perfect as always
-Cinematography wasn't that bad either

-Harry is a whiny brat
-Hermione is totally useless
-Ron seems to be the focus when it clearly isn't supposed to be
-The Death of Dumbledore isn't done well at all
-Draco Malfoy is a whiny b***h who can't do anything without crying

3041122,5,B000ZECQ08,"I was not a fan of director David Yates's adaptation of ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"", which was a disjointed mess that got neither the feel nor the substance of the book correct, so I was not optimistic about this sixth film in the Harry Potter series. The return of series scribe Steve Kloves seems to have made a big difference, because this movie does a great job of keeping all of the complex character interplay intact even as large chunks of plot are lost along the way. These characters felt like the characters I'd read in the books, and I care a lot more about that than having every scene from the book reproduced, however fleetingly. This is probably the least action-heavy of the movies so far, but if you don't care about the characters by now, why are you still watching?

The cinematography for the film went through a belaboured process. Cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel originally intended a very dark, very monochrome -- almost black and white -- look for the film. After seeing how far in that direction Delbonnel had gone, they panicked and ordered the unique look scaled back, with the color saturation boosted back up considerably. The result is a beautiful looking film, but NOT a natural looking film. The picture remains very dark, with a lot of detail lost to the shadows that there's no way of getting back. The midranges are anemic, because there simply wasn't that much detail to bring back in the first place. This is how the film looked in theaters and is NOT a fault of the Blu-ray presentation. It's how the movie's supposed to look, even if that look isn't everyone's cup of tea.",1280102400,3,1627,4.649305555555555

3041132,3,B000ZECQ08,"I agree that Half-Blood Prince is by FAR the most boring film in the entire Harry Potter series.  This is because the entire film has a very quiet and uninteresting storyline, a noticeably dull atmosphere, and a familiarity that's getting quite annoying by this point, to be totally honest.  Almost like they're milking the Harry Potter series for all it's worth.  A movie like this makes such a theory seem VERY likely.

In addition to the movie just being boring to watch (among other problems) the majority of the film has a ""been there, done that"" feel to it.  The walking footsteps that appear whenever Harry Potter opens up a map?  Been there, done that.  The images of people moving inside the picture frames?  Yes, we've seen that several times by this point, and yes, at one point it was really cool to witness but now it's just repeating the same old formula that made the Harry Potter series successful in the first place.  The famous broom game?  Yes, it's here (though only seen in brief moments).

Another annoying aspect of Half-Blood Prince is the way Harry Potter and his friends carry on the most pointless conversations imaginable concerning girlfriends and friendships.  The entire first half of the film deals with this, and it's really totally unnecessary.  We're talking about an hour and a half of this specific storyline.  NOT good.

Also, there's hardly any special magical effects that involve Harry Potter and his friends casting bizarre spells. This means the adventure and fun has been almost completely sucked out of it.  Furthermore, there's no really big dramatic finish involving Harry battling some exciting and dangerous creature.  Nope, none of that takes place.

To give one example, Harry and friends stumble upon a huge tarantula.  Instead of something neat taking place possibly involving Harry's magical long list of spells bringing the creature to life, it's just a boring conversation between all the characters and a howling dog.  Incredibly dull.

I shouldn't have to read the books either because I've been following along to the movie series the entire time.  If I have to read the books, that means the movie writers didn't do their job in delivering a satisfying storyline.

You also have to understand that since I've been following the Harry Potter movie series since the very beginning, it makes perfect sense that I should expect a dramatic and exciting conclusion out of each movie in the series because that's the successful formula they've been using.

This film is a really big letdown, and I think it's time for the series to stop for good.  Enough is enough guys.",1276992000,3,2623,4.906818181818182

This movie, and Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix before it, are the ""indie art films"" of the series, with a grainy monochrome look (Yates seems partial to blue or amber), artsy camera angles, and s-l-o-w-w-w pacing. There's another problem with Half Blood Prince. Though Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson had their English accents from the beginning, I could always understand them. Not this time. They fumfer and mumble and I could not comprehend anything they said. The older Brit actors--Michael Gambon, Alan Rickman, Jim Broadbent, etc.,--are fine in this regard. The acting is terrific, and Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy is genuinely affecting. The big set pieces--attack on The Barrows, ""Inferi Island,"" the--well, this CAN'T be a spoiler by now but look away if you've been hibernating--murder of Dumbledore (though the subsequent chase and splendiferous funeral from the book are missing). The most entertaining parts of the movie are the ones dealing with Ron and Harry's slow realization of which girls they love.

3041140,4,B000ZECQ08,"In the excellent fifth movie in the series, the kids face danger and death for the first time. The sixth movie adds the perils of romance. The best parts of this movie are when the kids are coping with love, be it unrequited or over-affectionate. Radcliffe (Harry) and Watson (Hermione), at least, have really grown into their roles; Grint (Ron) does a pretty good job as well, though he's rather handcuffed by the role of buffoonish sidekick. When called upon for a serious performance, though, he comes through.

The usual cast of regulars are terrific, with the addition of Jim Broadbent as Slugworth fitting in perfectly. The story moves along quickly, leaving out some of the nuances of the book. I would have liked to have seen more of Voldemort's childhood, as is revealed in the book, but the important bits are there.

Sadly, the special features on this DVD set aren't all that special. The additional scenes are mostly filler here and there--they look like they were trimmed off the beginning or end of other scenes rather than being full scenes in their own right. And there's not much else on the disc of interest.

Tried new DVD players with the new TV, then my old and first DVD player, it does it on every one. Not such a bargain at $9.99 after all since I now need to go buy a new DVD if I want to watch the movie again without all the problems.

I'd like less lovey dovey, more bone-crushing magical action, please.

Yours in wizarding,

Me

While I found this movie entertaining, I thought it was more of a logistical backflip than a great movie in its own right. I recall that one of the things that impressed me the most about this book in the series was its deft set-up for the final installment. The movie operates in much the same way. Though there is some plot action going on (most notably, Dumbeldore's death), the primary purpose of this part of the tale is to put all the pieces in place for a grand finish.

There was an emphasis on the raging hormones of all the characters in this movie, but I thought it a bit overdone and oversimplified. Less love and more story, please!

Effects were great, with the horcrux scene in a gloomy cave being particularly noteworthy. I was also impressed with the actor who played Voldemort/Tom Riddle at 16, Frank Dillane. Beautiful, with just the right touch of creepy. Worth seeing, but I'm much more excited about the coming two movies. Hope they don't screw them up.",1273449600,,1091,4.65625
3041147,5,B000ZECQ08,"But he does, in the sixth installment of the Harry Potter epic. Once you read the seventh and final book, Dumbledore's death becomes clear in the context of his own story: you could say that he was already dead - just on borrowed time (given to him by Snape, the character we all love to hate). Of course, with such detailed and complex stories it's always a challenge to bring them to the screen in a way that makes sense, and especially for HP and the Half-Blood Prince it's essential to have read all the books up to and including this one before you see the film. The backstories, the build-up, the carefully crafted plots and subplots and all of their twists and turns can become muddled and confusing without having read the books first, but the filmmakers have done a good job delivering the story. There are a few changes which don't seem to make a lot of sense; for instance the burning of the Burrow, and an anti-climactic kiss between Ginny and Harry in the Room of Requirement, but overall the story is as exciting on film as it is in the pages. What's really noteworthy about the climax of HBP is that Harry has all along been saying Snape and Draco are the bad guys, and lo and behold it looks as if he was finally right. But is he really? Look for the upcoming film versions of The Deathly Hallows, but read it first! Two or three times!

3041152,2,B000ZECQ08,"This should be called ""A very loose translation of a story associated with the book Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince""

I really enjoyed the Harry Potter books, and the audio books(with Jim Dale Narrating) even more. This movie, as well as the previous ones, are simply an attempt by some screenwriter to get his name up in shining lights. The story is quite different from the books. I realize that much has to be cut from the books in order to make it into a reasonable length movie, but there are many parts in the movie that were changed, as if for no other reason but that the screenwriter could get away with it.
For instance:

 The beginning of this movie has Harry in a local shop, (not in the book) and has cut out any reference to #4 Privit Dr. This opening could have been done much better in the time allotted. Quite frankly the beginning of the book is the funniest part in the the whole book.

 The train ride to Hogwarts is changed considerably, with no real apparent reason to do so. This whole section has been reduced to garbage.

 The book has Tonks finding Harry on the train, but the movie has Luna Lovegood doing it. Since Tonks is not cut entirely from the movie, this really doesn't make any sense.

 The Burrow is burned to the ground in the movie, which has nothing whatsoever to do with the book. Stupid.

 All of the battle at Hogwarts has been cut.

 The part in the tower bothers me the most I would say. The book has Harry immobilized through this whole part, unable to do or say anything. The movie however, has Harry just standing there, while Snape and Draco do their thing. Absolutely stupid. It really goes against what Harry's character is all about.

 It seems that none of the students are now required to wear robes. They are all running around in either suits, or jeans and a tee shirt.

None of these changes needed to be made, really. It wouldn't make one bit of difference as far as time or money. It is a dreadful shredding of what is one of the better books in the series, and the changes really just serve to deaden the story line, and set up another two dreadful movies to come. I will not be paying to see those in the theater for sure.

Foolish screenwriters. What a waste. The movies keep getting worse and worse.

The acting has gotten, if anything, worse in Radcliff's case. He always has a stupid grin on his face, as if he finds the whole thing very funny. As he is supposed to be in some very dire circumstances in this movie, it really just ruins the effect completely.

 I did like Rupert Grint's handling of Ron's character. I thought he nailed it.

What bothers me the most, is that all the young fans that made Rowling rich, are expecting a decent representation of the the books put into film. They are all so excited to see these films. Instead what they get is a great disappointment.",1271635200,17,2853,4.375711574952562

Anyway, I did not like this movie as much as the others. There were too many things, important things, which are in the books that did not show up at the movie. For instance, I felt showing Lord Voldemort's past about his family from his mother's side, and his mother's story would have added to the movie. There were more memories in Dumbledore's pensieve that were central to the story that the movie did not show.

Again, I enjoyed the earlier Harry Potter movies more than the recent ones. I am not fond of the director, David Yates, that has been directing (badly) the latest installments.

Also, I missed the portrayal of a young Tom Riddle by Christian Coulson from ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets."" Nothing against the new actor playing a young Lord Voldemort, but I felt that the former was better suited for the role.

I wasn't a big fan of 'The Order of the Phoenix', but even though alot of the story was changed or left out, it wasn't to the extent of this piece of garbage. From the first scene in which Harry was sitting in a diner getting hit on by a waitress, I knew that things were not looking good. What happened to the opening when Dumbeldore picks up Harry from the Dursley's house, and explains about him having to live in their house until he was 17 in order for him to remain safe? Is that not important to the story? What about Dumbeldores blackened hand, and the mystery behind it? And for goodness sakes, why on earth was that man for Slughorn cast? He didn't fit the description of him at all, and in the beginning in which Dumbeldore takes Harry to 'convince' Slughorn to teach at Hogwarts, is so awkward and with no explanation, it was confusing. So much was left out, Fleur and Bill weren't even mentioned or seen in the movie and the next book begins with their wedding. I wonder how that will be explained.. The ending was by far the worst part of the movie ever. You had Harry prowling around while Draco and Snape took care of Dumbeldore and what is really amusing is that nobody seemed to care. Snape strolls out of the school with his Deatheater buddies like they're going out for a cup of tea and Harry reluctantly follows them. The gripping climatic ending was missing, Dumbeldores funeral was bypassed so that all the wizards and witches could hold up their wands like 'candles in the wind' in memory of Dumbeldore. So LAME!

I could go on and on with one scene after the other about how it either wasn't relevant, or was completely changed. Id say that out of a 2 1/2 hour movie, only 10-20 minutes were actual things from the book. I kept on wondering while I was watching this travesty of a film, if I would have liked it if I hadn't read the book; and my conclusion was, NO. The movie was sooo boring, and disjointed with most of the plot left out, jumping from one unexplained scene to the next, and with additions that made absolutely no sense (why was the burrow burned?) Even the characters seemed dull and lifeless. I saw no emotion from anyone, and all the interaction seemed like no one cared.  Maybe they knew that the adapted story was horrendous and they just didn't give a damn. I really don't understand why the movie was vastly different from the book. They really weren't kidding when they said 'based on a novel', 'extremely loosely based' would be a more accurate description. Boo hoo, for the screenwriters and director, this movie was really insulting to Harry Potter fans. If I was able to give it 0 stars I would.",1269388800,6,2743,4.4189723320158105

3041167,5,B000ZECQ08,"Books and movies have different strengths and weaknesses. What works in one medium may very well not work in another. The pacing is also different - books can read at the pace of the reader; movies are watched in one sitting.

I have read the book but it was five years ago when it came out. Frankly, I wouldn't be the best person to ask how well the movie follows the book. I do think the movie captures the essence of the book quite well. The major themes of the book seem to all be there. I think it's only fair to judge the movie by how well it succeeds as a movie.

The movie (like the book) has the difficult task of setting up the grand finale while being entertaining in its own right. This it does brilliantly. New cast member Jim Broadbent is outstanding as the inherently decent but weak Horace Slughorn. The returning cast are also at the top of their game. Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy really shines here. He plays the anguished and conflicted Draco Malfoy for all it's worth. Draco seems to be a lot more sympathetic here than in the book. This is no doubt the filmmaker's intention; we'll have to wait to see how this plays out. Michael Gambon as Dumbledore is also great. The ""three"" effortlessly handle their roles. Radcliffe and Grint are especially good when ""under the influence"".

The only reservation I have about recommending this movie is that the previous five installments should be watched to get the full impact of the film.

3041178,3,B000ZECQ08,"This franchise is one of the few that can safely refute the old adage that sequels are never as good as the original.  Indeed, it's something of an amazement how the Potter franchise has managed to maintain such quality of filmmaking after so many sequels.  I think that's why interest is still so high for these films after so many years and probably why the final book is being split into 2 films, to milk it for all they can - not to imply the story isn't worth it; I'm glad their are two more films to look forward to rather than just one.  But, as with most of the other larger book translations (eg. Goblet of Fire) there was a lot of interesting moments cut from the film rendition that we can only hope may someday be restored in the eventual ultimate BD editions ala the first two films (assuming they were actually shot).

As is, the sixth film in the Potter franchise plays more like a filler to build anticipation for the final installments, than a self-contained story with a unique and notable purpose of its own.  The series has become progressively darker and more mature with each installment and this is no exception.  Gone is much of the innocense and naive wonder that built this esoteric cobblestone world.  But for those of us so enthralled, seeing it visually imagined as capably, dare I say, brilliantly, can be reward enough (assuming the final chapters make up for the story that this one lacks) even if there is little payoff in the end.

As for the BD, I think Warner's authoring has gradually improved over the past couple of years.  The days of their masters being biased for the limitations of the DVD format seems to be drifting further and further behind - at least for new release titles.  Most of their catalog HD offerings still tend to be a little lacking in detail - often more than a little.  But with films that have been recently mastered like this one, there's little reason to complain, based on 1080p/24 projection onto a 100"" screen (smaller displays will no doubt be more foregiving, just as larger projected images could magnify problems I didn't notice or at least didn't find too cumbersome).",1267747200,2,2141,4.593175853018373

While I realize things have to be omitted and trimmed for reasons of time and expense, there was no excuse for the butchering this Director Yates did to this movie. He didn't trim... he decided to rewrite the entire book to his own version... as if he thought he could do a better job than a billionaire author? It had nothing to do with saving money either. Did it not occur to him that hundreds of millions of fans had already read the book and were expecting some semblance of similarity between the movie and the book? Did they think they would win brownie points with ANY of us by butchering our story? We don't go to the Potter movies to see something different. We go to see a video version of the books we read because we enjoyed the books... not a hack job by some hack director trying to rewrite the series. Where the heck were the executive controls at WB who should have been watching what Yates was doing? And who did Yates blackmail to get the last 2 movies after what he did to this one? It certainly was not a case of talent on his part.

I had to reread the book to make sure I didn't miss something. The things this director did to butcher this movie did nothing to improve the story or save money and were completely unnecessary. We have to wonder if Yates ever bothered to read the books. I shudder to think what this poor excuse for a director will do to the final two movies. We'll watch it because we have no choice... but I can guarantee, after the Potter films, I will never, ever watch another movie directed by Yates... ever again. I hope everyone else boycotts his future ambitions as well.

Burning down the Weasley's home... what purpose did that serve except to upset all of the fans? It was disrespectful like having someone spit on your family heirlooms. It did nothing to improve the movie or ""move along"" the progress of the movie. It had no useful purpose whatsoever and certainly did not please any of the movie fans and wasted the original Christmas scene... which would not have required as many expensive CGI's as this distorted Yates version used.

Same with the exclusion of the interaction with the Dursely's and Dumbledore... so instead this terrible director has Harry hanging out in the underground metro diner hitting on some waitress while reading the daily profit out in the open... while Dumbledore appears outside the metro station dressed in his usual Wizard robes for all the muggles to see.... Not only was this totally in contradiction with the book, it served no useful purpose except to leave the entire audience wondering if they were watching the right movie. A dud of an opener.

The exclusion of Kreacher and Harry's inheriting Sirius's home made no sense whatsoever. Kreacher is a big part of the final book.
There is no semblance of a relationship between Harry and Ginny. That entire endeavor has fallen flat and nothing they can do will spark that part of the storyline now. There is zero magic between them. In fact, there is much more magic between Neville and Ginny than there is with Harry. Every relationship they have tried with Harry has been a dud. Hermione would have been the only one which might have worked.
The relationship with Lavender and Ron was just terrible. Talk about ""over acting!"" They could have cut that part out and none of us would have missed it.
Neville was almost nonexistent in the movie and that's a shame. He adds a lot to the stories.
Cutting out all of the storyline about Riddle's family was cutting out the heart of why Voldemort is so obsessed about hating muggles and the hypocrisy of it.

Then there was this ridiculous Yates version of the potions book. Like others have commented... Snape didn't even react to Harry nearly killing Malfoy. He didn't even act upset as he calmly healed Malfoy's wounds... and unlike the book, Harry wasn't even punished. Part of that punishment would have given Harry an insight as to how cruel his own father had been toward Snape.

Yet, Yates completely changed the story where Harry put the book in the room of requirement with the Tiara on top of it... which is critical for the ending of the final book. It is substituted with some ridiculous scene with Ginny hiding the book... ending with a flat moment of meaningless intimacy.

The worst moment of the movie by Yates is where Harry remained quietly below, watching while Dumbledore was being accosted and killed... where in the book, he had been paralyzed by Dumbledore and covered with his cloak so he could not interfere. I can't see where changing this scene saved a single penny or a single moment of time. What it did was to be completely out of character for Harry to just stand there gaping while his mentor was killed. This was totally unpalatable for fans.

Then, out of the blue, Snape declares himself to be the Half Blood Prince... when there wasn't any reason given in the movie as to why Snape would even be aware that Harry was familiar with that name or the book... other than the fact that he had used one of his own spells on him... but there was no connecting storyline in the film that made his statement make any sense. It was just blurted totally out of context.

The big let down was the ending. There was no ending. It just faded away without any climax or closure. It ended with a dud.

I don't know what WB is thinking... but they are allowing Yates to make enemies out of millions... hundreds of millions of fans. That is a huge fan base to upset just to protect some hack director who is butchering the most popular series of books ever published. I cannot imagine where their heads are... certainly not anywhere we can describe in public... Just like the idiots who cancelled Star Trek... a billion dollar franchise. Shallow thinking pitbulls who can't leave a good thing alone... and then blame everyone but themselves when they shoot themselves in the foot.

Yes... we go to the Harry Potter movies expecting to see what we read in the book with the understanding that they don't have time to include everything. We do not go to the Harry Potter movies to see the story changed or rewritten.

There is only one thing that all the fans would agree on having rewritten.... and that would be to use the resurrection stone to bring back Sirius, Dumbledore and everyone else who was killed in the series... including Harry's parents and Snape. If WB and Yates want to change something... then change that! That is the one change we would welcome... and it might be enough to salvage WB's reputation from this hack job they allowed to be perpetrated on our movie series.",1266969600,83,6804,4.5855263157894735

3041187,1,B000ZECQ08,"Harry Potter books have captured the hearts and minds of many people around the world for a reason. The further into the story the books delved the more remarkable the characters and the story line became. One would think that the movie would try to capture this spirit; but, alas, not this time. It was extremely disappointing to watch this film. I'm not sure where the director for this film - David Yates - was dug up, but I have never seen anyone mutilate the story as successfully as this man has done. In my opinion the movie didn't show a story, it flashed a bunch of flash cards (episodes) that were quite mediocre in their content. The scenes were a collection of action shots that had very little joining them together.
  The second biggest gripe I have with this director is miscasting of characters. He was a director in previous Harry Potter film and I didn't care for his choice of Dolores Umbridge, but this time he managed to outdo his previous poor choice - the character of Professor Slughorn was completely miscast and misrepresented in comparison to the character shown in the book. Professor Slughorn was one of my favorite characters in this book - his wit, his shrewdness, his talent in potion making, his charisma, his little weaknesses (love of good wine, good food and love of the company of the ""movers and the shakers"") all of it completely gone... No reason, just crossed out from existence. Watching the Slughorn's character in the film, you constantly wonder, why would Dumbledore - the greatest wizard of all - would pick such a feeble excuse for a human being teaching these remarkable kids? Oh, yea, it's just because he had this memory. But then why did this looser teach Harry's parents? According to the film, who knows... If you've read the book you know that Slughorn was extremely talented, and even though he belonged to Slytherin house and had his weaknesses, he had principles and was not going to give them up. That was the reason why Dumbledore chose him - his strength of character and his talent, and of course having a special memory was an ""icing on the cake"". But you'll find none of this information in the film.
  My third huge complain is Snape. Throughout the previous films Alan Rickman has captured the audiences with his Snape - stealthy, quiet, coiled up like a snake, striking like a cobra - you could see the passions and hate shining through his eyes. He held his students in the ""iron fist""; order and discipline reigned in his classroom.  This film however made me constantly think ""Is this Snape? What the heck happened to him?"" (and then I would back up and say ""Oh, yea, 'wonderful' film director, that's what happened to him"").  In the bathroom when Harry cursed Malfoy with Snape's curse and walked away, Snape saw it all and has not done a thing, didn't punish Harry, didn't get other teachers involved as he's done in the past at the slightest hint of Harry's misbehavior (and here, mind you, someone almost got killed), didn't torment him, nothing... Just healed Malfoy as if nothing happened and everyone went on their merry way... And of course the ending - where in the book you see all the passions raging inside the man, in the movie Snape just matter-of-factly tells Harry ""I'm the Half Blood Prince"" and walks away, he might as well told Harry ""Never mind this whole wizard war thing, I'll just go get a sandwich"" Where is the passion, where is the climax????
  The whole Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione love stories were as flat, gray and lifeless as a piece of cardboard. I'm not even sure why they were included in the movie, because after looking closely these scenes didn't seem to serve a purpose. They didn't add any depth to the characters (again due to the 'wonderful' director's skills), didn't add anything new or interesting to the story. Probably they were used in hopes to appease the 'chick flick' lovers.
  Having said all that, I still gave the movie 1 star because of the special effects. They were not bad, I did like the way the pensieve and memories were depicted. However, that alone can't make a film.  Considering that David Yates will film the last 2 films in the series, I don't think I'll be going to see them in the movies; will wait for the dvd to come out and borrow from a friend.",1266796800,8,4286,4.633728590250329
3041188,5,B000ZECQ08,"I am a really big fan of the Harry Potter books as well as the films, and I must say that--although Half-Blood Prince was not my favorite film--it was an incredible film. To this day, Prisoner of Azkaban remains the strongest piece of filmmaking in the series; but this one closely follows. For those who gave this film a negative review, I can sympathize; but people have to realize what it entails to make a film. It will never be the book. Of course, the first few films followed their stories quite accurately, but the size of the book has played a huge role. As the books have become progressively bigger, it has become more of a challenge for the filmmakers to adapt the story. I think Yates and Steve Kloves did an exceptional job adapting this book. The scenes that needed to be left in, were, and the ones that weren't were chopped off. Many people have complained that the film was boring, but I do not think that has anything to do with how the movie was made. If the movie followed the book, word for word, people still would have had the same complaint. If you're looking for the thrills and adventure that you got in Goblet of Fire, you won't find it here; this film has more of a narrowly-focused plot, whereas in GOF, there seemed to be too much going on for one film. Here, in HBP, Yates chooses to focus on and play up the relationships (since they will be essential for the last film); he touches on certain aspects of Voldemort's past that give clear enough evidence of his origins and why he turned out the way he did; and he builds up an obvious tension for a climax that will inevitably occur in the last film. Not only does Yates deliver a more subtle film, but he delivers one of the best looking films in the series. The visual tone and cinematography of this film are top-notch, and cannot be compared to any of the other films, except Prisoner of Azkaban.

Give this movie a chance and appreciate it in its own terms. If possible, don't step into it prepared to compare it to the book, because chances are you will be disappointed. Additionally, don't think it will be like Goblet of Fire; the book wasn't even like Goblet of Fire. Many people I know seem to put all the films on a scale with Goblet of Fire, but Goblet of Fire worked more on an action level on par with films such as Transformers and Spider-Man. These stories, as they progress, become more focused on a universal and political dilemma: that Voldemort has returned; and the relationships, because of it, are enhanced and exhibited more fluently. Yes, the films become more dialogue-driven and less colorful; but so do the books. In changing the tone and pacing of the movie, the audience is allowed to witness the threat Voldemort poses in the Wizarding World.

Let this movie take you in; it's an amazing work of art and filmmaking.",1266796800,,2829,4.48062015503876

3041202,5,B000ZECQ08,"I constantly and consistently hear complaints from Harry Potter book fanatics about the film adaptions. Oh they left this out! Oh they left that out! It's the same sorry grumbling time after time. And I wish it would stop. The mediums (literary and theatrical) are not 100% compatible. Period. It will NEVER, EVER happen. This movie alone was 153 minutes long, right in line with the rest of the series in terms of length. But this one stands out quite a bit compared to the others for a couple of reasons...

The first is that this is a mature story. As Harry (Daniel Radcliffe,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter-and-the-Goblet-of-Fire/dp/B000Q6ZG52/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</a>), Hermoine (Emma Watson,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prisoner-of-Azkaban/dp/B000Q6ZG5C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</a>) and Ron (Rupert Grint,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Driving-Lessons/dp/B000PAAJW4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Driving Lessons</a>) continue their natural physical growth, so does the story. With age comes interest in the opposite sex, increasing responsibilities, and increased danger. It is this last one that stands out for the film, too. Dangerous and dark, this story is the most muted in terms of fun that any of us have seen so far. Director David Yates (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Girl-in-the-Cafe/dp/B000A59PL0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Girl in the Cafe</a>) pulls off a stunningly stark and surreal landscape that has altered Hogswart from a place of fun and learning, to one of deception and dread.

The second reason this one stands out is that it never spoonfeeds the viewer. If you don't know what something means, or where you're at, or why someone is interested in someone else, well, you're outta luck. But the connections within the film, if you pay attention, will give you all the answers. I applaud screenwriter Steve Kloves for stepping up and giving us an adult fantasy story that, at times, can make you squirm in your seat or jump out of it. I was actually surprised that the film retained a cool PG rating instead of PG-13.

The third reason this film works is that it touches on relationships in a hard way. Fomenting strong bonds with each other, and sticking to them, is not something that is normal in society, and we see the fraying of friendships as they mutate, and watch how death can affect even the sturdiest of hearts.

HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE outstrips all the other Harry Potter films for these very important reasons. And as for the ending? No complaints on that from me, either. I can't wait to see what Harry and his friends do next.",1266105600,,2886,5.880668257756564

Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was really good but I liked the first 2 Harry Potter movies that were directed by Chris Columbus better than the last few movies. I think the later movies have been getting a little too dark for my taste. This last one was true to the story but the director has left out all of the things that make Harry Potter books and movies fun. No paintings with moving images, no fantastic beasts, we hardly saw Hagrid, and the beauty of the countryside was totally left out in this movie. The director is filming everything darkly, no beauty at all. I think showing the fun side of things makes the bad things that happen stand out even more, so when you take away the good things everything is just a shade of grey.

However, Half Blood Prince was more about raging hormones than the core message of this story.  I was especially disappointed at the end.  How could intruders enter Hogwarts, kill Dumbledore, destroy the Great Hall and then just leave without detection or response FROM ANYBODY in the castle????

3041243,3,B000ZECQ08,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is the next to last in the series about the young wizard who is fated to fight the forces of the dark wizard, Lord Voldemort. Earlier films were closer to the story in the book than is this. I admit that as the books got longer it became more difficult to put everything into a 2 hour or so movie.

But this book does hit the high spots, despite some wasted time in scenes not in the book. If you are not familiar with the books and earlier movies you should probably go watch the earlier movies first to get the necessary background to appreciate what is happening.

Harry is asked to secure a vital memory from one of his teachers, a memory that will help Hogwarts headmaster Dumbledore and Harry find a way to stop the evil Voldemort from renewing his war on the wizarding community. Meanwhile, Harry is given a Potions textbook with extensive notes by someone calling himself the HalfBlood Prince. These notes allow Harry to excel at Potions for the first time in his Hogwarts career, to the annoyance of Hermione Grange, witch without peer at the school.

But the Prince, it seems, is not entirely a good wizard....

But more would spoil the story.

The last Potter film will be out soon and you might want to wait until that is available and get the set of 7 that will most likely have tons of extra material. But if, like me, you missed Half-Blood Prince in the theaters this is worth the money.",1265414400,,1441,4.443181818181818

3041269,4,B000ZECQ08,"I love Harry Potter. I am an adult HP freak.

This film is about average as far as the HP film series is concerned, better than Order of the Phoenix, but not up to the quality of Goblet of Fire or Prisoner of Azkaban. A lot of that has to do with the sometimes inexplicable writing and direction. Plot lines deviate from the book for no apparent reason, and others are created where the plot from the book would have been perfectly fine.

The young actors all do great to ok jobs. Bonnie Wright is especially wonderful in her portrayal of Ginny Weasley; although the budding romance between her and Harry is not developed as it is in the book, it's done sweetly and believably. Dan Radcliffe continues to grow as an actor, and there is no question that he is now capable of carrying a film. Emma Watson gives her best performance as Hermione Granger; she is excellent in the scene where she and Harry commiserate with each other about their unhappy love lives. Rupert Grint is adequate as Ron Weasley.

Technically the film is very good. it's the first one I've watched on Blu-ray, and it's quite enjoyable. I was told, before the Oscar nominations, that it would get a Cinematography nomination, and so it did. The music is ok, nothing special. Special effects are very good. One can only wish that, as I said, the direction and writing had been better.

I think that general audiences will love Half-Blood Prince, but that Harry Potter nerds like me will like it but wish it had remained truer to the book.",1265328000,,1508,4.533088235294118

If you have not been keeping up with Harry's exploits, this is not the movie to introduce you to his world.  It feels like the middle of the story.  I realize that this is basically a ""middle story"" in the books, but if you are new to Potterworld then you would not want to start with this movie. It begins almost exactly where the last movie ended; It might be a good idea to watch 'Order of the Phoenix' before watching this movie to avoid feeling a bit lost at the beginnning as I did. The story carries on and the end leaves you feeling as if it were unfinished; not really reaching its own resolution but merely a breathing point before taking off on the next HP adventure.

Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is not one of those horrible 'book to movie' movie.  Actually it is one of my more favorite Harry Potters from the 6 movies so far.  It isn't EXACTLY like the book, but it doesn't go too far off the path as to where I am hating the movie for messing up a scene.

Director Yates and screenwriter Kloves have taken one of the more trivial of the entries in Rowling's book series and turned it into one of the better films, with a fairly deft hand at comedy and action alike; though obviously large chunks of the book were excised in the transition to screen, the film version of the Half-Blood Prince transfers the essence of Rowling's work to the screen with grace, eliciting few complaints from this fan of the book.

I spent 153 minutes squinting and craning my neck at the screen trying to see what was happening: the film is so dark it looks like they filmed it by candlelight. Absolutely horrid. Whereas the previous films in this series did a reasonably successful job of encapsulating the stories and filling in the back story, this film left out so much important detail that Snape's key pronouncement at the end, that he is the titular 'half-blood prince,' is a whopping 'So what?' moment that seems almost trivial. Great characters and major thematic elements are entirely marginalised or pushed so far to the periphery that the film feels lifeless and void.
Based on this clumsy adaptation, the fact that David Yates is going to be directing the final instalments does not bode well for the finale, unless he can learn to properly light scenes and not gut the story of its impact. Writer Steve Kloves and Editor Mark Day are to blame as well for robbing this film of all the magic viewers have come to expect from this series.

Its unrealistic to expect to see everything you read in the book transferred to the screen but I for one think that the movie is sometimes better off with the less is more approach.

I had to turn off all of my lights and close the window blinds and curtains to bring out the characters and scenery in those dark scenes.

As to the content of the movie, it was and will be the darkest of the HP series. There are one or two liberties taken by the screen adaptation that deviated from the story line and may affect the final movies unless some magical type explanation is brought forth.

They saw it in the theatre and were very critical of it as omitting so much that it made little sense and was not a good cinema experience.

I think that their criticisms are essentially correct.  It was very difficult for me to understand what exactly was going on - there are many sequences that appear to have been filmed with the assumption that viewers had read the book.  What you get are the actors standing there, implying something significant yet explaining only the basics (e.g. the secret that the new character has in his mind, but not what the new character is doing when she forces Snape, with some ambivalence, to take the unbreakable oath).  That greatly lessens the enjoyment for casual viewers like myself.  Moreover, while there is plenty of action, there are many scenes are low key and quiet, with abrupt shifts to new scenes that are awkward from a storytelling point of view (e.g. Harry suddenly appears in Dumbledore's inner sanctum and they are working on memories stored in these vials).  At one point, the bad guys are in Hogwarts and they destroy some stuff and then that is all you hear from them - they just walk off.  It made little sense to me.

One of the strengths of the film is the advancement of the characters' personal lives, as couples begin to form in young love.  This is quite fun and romantic.

REcommended.  We have to follow this to the end, even peripherally interested parents like myself.  You must get it if HP is a part of the family interest/obsession, however weak this film is on its own.",1263600000,,1683,4.514851485148514

3041343,4,B000ZECQ08,"Realizing that you can't possibly cram every moment from the book into a movie short enough for theater owners to want to show or that most people (especially kids) will sit through I think they did a good enough job. The whole issue of the horcruxes was handled well enough as were the romances and Malfoy's angst over having been ordered to kill Dumbledore. I'm a little hazy on why they burned down the Burrow. Maybe to highlight Molly's growing fear of losing her husband or one of the kids but it seems to me they could have done that without the pyro.

That said I do have a couple of issues to vent. The editing was choppy at best. Certain conversations such as Dumbledore/Riddle at the orphanage seemed to have been cut and reassembled in a sloppy manner. It didn't sound natural. My other complaint lies with the omission of the memory dealing with the cup and locket. They're going to have to find a way for them to discover the existence of the cup in the last two movies although it seems to me it could have been handled here in about 90 seconds. Perhaps they're uncomfortable with the CGI of elves.

Anyway I'm not as big a fanatic as a lot of other reviewers so I'm not as easily frustrated. I started collecting these because of my daughter and have only read the last 3 books. She was 10 at the time and we've seen every episode in the theater since the first one.

3041344,5,B000ZECQ08,"Firstly, I am tired of everyone wanting the movies to be exactly like the books. No movie based on any book is an exact replica. And people should be used to the fact that none of the HP movies have included everything from the book... including the first two shortest books.

I believe the viewer needs to distance themselves from the books before entering the theater or putting any of the HP discs in their home theater. Movies and books are different, and should be treated as such. Now, I am a huge Harry Potter nerd and read at least the book the movie is based on before entering the theater (sometimes I read all the subsequent books) but this is for my own enjoyment. Yes, I compare what is different. But a good movie is a good movie. And Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is that.

Hands down this is the best Harry Potter film, even with the book-slashing changes. The kiddos are growing up not just in the story and real-life, but their acting skills have improved immensely, which makes this film easier for an adult-fan to enjoy. There's a lot of comedy relating to teen romance and crushes. I personally thought Lavender Brown was a great addition and does a great job showing how it feels to be a teen and in love. You delve deeper into the Dark Lord's history through Dumbledoore's memory and experience. And it's action-packed from the beginning. In addition, casting Jim Broadbent as Professor Slughorn was genious--he deserves an oscar nod. Malfoy has a more prominent role, as does Professor Snape.

People who haven't read the books may be confused. I found myself explaining some of the details left out to my younger sisters (after they asked me) who find the books boring. But they would have been fine had I not been there. Honestly, I was shocked by some of the absent book parts, but not anymore shocked than I felt after seeing the other movies.

This is my favorite Harry Potter film (previously the Prisoner of Azkanban had been my favorite). Now, I do wonder how they are going to explain a lot of important stuff in the final installments, but perhaps that is why they finally decided to do two parts--one part for book seven, and the other part to tie all the strings together, but combine them so they work as one? Yes, they should have planned better, but the books were only just finished in the summer 2007.

So go out and enjoy this movie as a movie, not as a movie made from a book.",1263340800,3,2428,4.509090909090909
3041345,2,B000ZECQ08,"It's been a long time since I read the book so I can't comment on the many plot elements left out, so I am judging the movie as a movie.  As such I was not impressed.  I will admit that the visual darkness is appropriate to the darkness of the plot, but this seemed to extend into the very acting; EVERYTHING was overlaid by a blanket of darkness and slowness.  It seemed to me that the actors were all told to deliver their lines like apathetic depressed people.  There were so many pauses in the middle of sentences, lines that seemed not to convey their characters appropriately.  Hogwarts ceased to feel like Hogwarts with the removal of all color and light.  Even the most intense and emotional scenes (Harry and Dumbledore at the underground lake and onwards) felt limp and drained.  I hoped for something truly scary at the lake scene, but the book was more intense than what we got!  (OK, I just lapsed into comparing it to the book!)

Clearly a lot of book plot was left out, but even what remained was not cohesive and did not work for me.",1263254400,,1049,4.393782383419689

  lets just say ,a few things happen that you should have seen coming a long time ago.then there are some genuine suprises if you hadnt read the book.
  i will give you a clue though.this movie is a lot like ""the revenge of the sith"" in many ways.
  i like all of the harry potter movies and this is no exeption.ron is still really funny.his would be gf shows her ugly side a bit.this movie was great fun and now im really psyched up for the upcoming 7th part and the lego video game.

3041379,4,B000ZECQ08,"Being a senior (60 yrs old) fan of Rowling's books and movies I found the movie very enjoyable. Yes it has the typical flaws of being a movie based on a long book that has sold millions of copies all over the world. Just like the Lord Of The Rings trilogy, there is more in the book than in the movie. Who would sit through a 12 hour movie anyway?

I won't nit pic the differences between the book and movie. The movie is Dark, both visually and in content. The characters are strong starting with Harry who is a man child suffering both the typical changes that confront a boy's journey to manhood and the demand to be more than a boy in a dangerous setting. You can't really call Hermione and Ron supporting cast. They are strong characters evolving on their own path sharing the journey with Harry through Hogwarts, OoP, death eaters, Voldemort, the Ministry of Magic etc. In actuality I believe that you would enjoy the movie more if you had read the book and vice versa. In fact I can't imagine not wanting to read the books and see the movies.

The movie is very entertaining with great scenery, excellent performances by the cast, strong visual effects, all based on the best series of fantasy books to come in half a century. Buy it! You wil want to see it again and again.",1262995200,,1281,4.378151260504202

Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince*
Well first let me start off and say I was jonesin' to see this movie, i had rediscovered the wonderful world of HarryPotter, about 6 months before HP6's theatrical release, and was anxiously awaiting, and expecting to see the ORIGINAL release in Nov 08. Only to find out about 2 to 3 months before that they decided to move it forward to Jul 09. I WAS FURIOUS!! My blood was boiling. Their excuse was ""summer movie sales are better"" so they knowingly make their die hard fans wait even LONGER and go into HP withdrawal to see this, all for the lust of the money, playing on people (suckers) who wilingly will throw $ at Harry Potter because its such an epic story, Shows how much these movie goons really care about what their patrons think!! -keep this in mind-
The movie-
So the day came when I got to see this movie. (I read the first 5 chapters of the book out of impatience) I sat down and it was almost like the first 15 just flash before your eyes (really choppy) They changed crap around, added unneccesary Politically Correctness, they all seemed different(persona's), the colors are muted (which is cool in its own right, but not very HP'ish)seemed too ""REAL"" for a fantasy movie, I was soooo confused by what was going on that by the time I could figure anything out the movie was over!! Really short movie. It also had that weird gloomyness and un-magicalness that ""Goblet of fire"" had (which is my least favorite HP movie), but it wasn't enough to completely RUIN the movie because that gloomyness is appropriate for HP6, but not the unmagicalness! They drained the fantasy out of this one, and there is plenty in the book! They ALSO spent WAAAAAAAAAY too much time on the foofy la-la love crap, when THAT could have been cut out instead of important key information (in the book) OKAY Voldemort wants to kill yalls asses but your sitting here whispering sweet nothings and playing footsie! The love crap really bugs me, its a real, to me,distraction & unimportant part of the story, and about 50% of the movie is wrapped up in the trio's love strings. I have no Idea how DYates will pull the 7th one off but im scared. Ive watched the movie 4-6 times, I finally just read the entire book to fully understand whats going on.
I don't understand the reinvisioning being done. JUST DO IT LIKE THE BOOK DAMNIT! I know its a book to movie adaptation, but thats exactly what it is an ADAPTATION, make it adapt to fit into a movie! That doesnt mean REINVISION & REWRITE the story according to the director!!! This goes all back to the lack of respect to the loyal consumer/patron, there is no respect, they know they're getting your money regardless, so WHO CARES?!  Now I hear, there is to be ""Nude scenes"" and added scenes not from the book(WHY ARE YOU ADDING? you need to being tying up the s**t you left out!) in the 7th AND part 1 will ""seem more realistic"" MORE REALISTIC?! ARE YOU KIDDING?!! part 2 will be more ""Operatic"" WHAT THE?!?! so are they going to pull that November to July stunt again too?! I wouldnt doubt it!! I tell ya, after the HP saga is done, and the movies are out and I can complete my DVD collection, im done with the movie world! and Im done with MOVIE trends such as VCR 2 DVD 2 BLU-ray! Its a money making machine that I wash my hands of! I will watch ONLY my personal collection & old movies from now on, screw these new trends and the ""I'll do what I want"" attitude from the movie producers and home movie industry! Honestly the only reason I give these crooks my Harry Potter money is because I believe the story IS leged, and it sucks this moron got his slimey little mits on it. Going into this movie HP6, was like buying weed but getting a bag of oregano- Looks like weed but lacks the substance! I don't understand whats going on in David Yates' pea brain, but I see him taking this Flaming torch of a movie saga and dunking it in cold water.",1262908800,3,4012,4.407008086253369

3041411,1,B000ZECQ08,"While many of the other reviews are noteworthy, I'll just bring up the two reasons I couldn't watch this DVD.

1) it was dark.  Not in the sense of ""evil foreboding"" but dark as in ""you can't see what's going on because it's all so badly lit.""  This movie gave me a headache because I was constantly squinting and trying to make out what was happening in all of those dark shadows.  You'd think with all the money the books made they'd be able to afford more than a single flashlight to light all the sets.

2) the DRM made it impossible to watch the whole movie.  If you want to watch this on you laptop or other computer, forget it.  They got this so wrapped up with a terrible DRM that you can't watch it on a computer.  And because the people in congress care more about collecting bribes that representing the people, they actually made it a law that you can't return a DVD once it's been opened.  So if you buy this and discover you can't play it on your computer, tough, you can't return it.

So really, don't buy this.  Don't tolerate bad lighting and crippling DRM.",1262736000,2,1074,4.293532338308458
3041412,5,B000ZECQ08,"Yes, the movie has holes. Yes, even as a Harry Potter fan some parts of the movie make absolutely zero sense. And the add ons of Harry Potter and the Waitress, Dumbledore going to subway tunnels, and Draco and the Bird were a little over played, but I still loved this movie. Why, because it had a lot of Draco in it! I never noticed how hot Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) was. He grew up!

Why else do I love the movie? The visual effects are stunning. The pace is remarkable and I wasn't bored during any part of the movie (although like I said I was a little confused). This is the only Harry Potter movie I had to watch three times inorder to understand it.

Should you buy it? As a Harry Potter fan, yes. As a movie fan, yes. As a graphic designer, yes. As a nerd, yes. Love the movie. Enjoy the movie. It is epic along with the series.

3041413,5,B000ZECQ08,"First of all - for those who complain that the filmakers leave their favorite parts from the HP books out of the movies, that's just part of adapting hundreds of pages of text into a workable screenplay and script. The HP movies and books should never be directly compared, nor were they ever intended to be - even Jo Rowling approves of all the plot licenses taken and modifications made for the film adaptations.

That being said, The Half-Blood Prince is the best HP film since the Prizoner of Azkaban. Director David Yates has really got the feel of the HP world nailed down now - he started to get in Order of the Phoenix, but has really got it now. The production and set design is beautiful, and they managed to use the special effects shots to great advantage in the film - as a compliment to the story, not as the star of the show. This is not a special effects movie, it's a great movie with very good special effects (the cave scene is terrifying). To those complaining about the acting - I couldn't disagree more. The kids (Harry, Ron, Hermione) finally got back the great chemistry they had in Prisoner of Azkaban. Dan Radcliff is also finally maturing and showed some real acting chops and great comic timing in the Felix Felicis scenes. Jim Broadbent's performance as Horace Slughorn is the best REAL acting the HP series has seen to date - exceptional work from him.

Although a significant part of the book ending is omitted from the movie it will serve as a wonderful dramatic and emotional opening for the last film. I look forward to the finale.",1262649600,,1565,4.5265017667844525
3041414,2,B000ZECQ08,"Is it over yet? That's what I was thinking as this 6th installment of the Harry Potter series unfolded in front of me. Then when it actually did end my kids and I said almost in unison, ""That's the end?!?"" Wow. If ever I've seen a movie that was pure filler until the next installment...Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince was it! What a completely forgettable movie.

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, Chamber of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban, Goblet of Fire & Order of the Phoenix were all at minimum very good. Certainly Sorcerer's Stone, Chamber and Goblet of Fire are as memorable as it gets. Azkaban was relatively slow compared to the others, and Order of the Phoenix, was also a bit drawn out, but still pretty good.

The A-list actors giving A-list performances goes on and on in this series of films....You have Richard Harris (GRHS) who was flawlessly and un-noticeably (no disrespect intended) replaced by Michael Gambon; Miranda Richardson, Gary Oldman, there's Alan Rickman doing his best Jeremy Irons imitation, Ralph Fiennes, John Hurt, Shirley Henderson, John Cleese and of course Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid. I know I'm forgetting more, but you get the idea.

Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber were brilliantly led by the direction of Veteran Chris Columbus (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Home-Alone/dp/B00008N6NQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Home Alone</a>&nbsp;and tons more). And the cast of these films?...How often do three unknowns (Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, Emma Watson as Hermione Granger and Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley) walk into overnight stardom? Not very often. But these three sure did. And it's well deserved. Their characters are well acted and believable; not bad for a bunch of preteens whose debuts now seem so long ago.

Azkaban was really good and certainly an integral part of the Harry Potter progression of stories. But Azkaban was the first hand-off of the director baton from Columbus to the short resumed, mostly-foreign-film-guy Alfonso Cuarn (prior to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Children-of-Men/dp/B000N6TX1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Children of Men</a>). Columbus still had oversight as a producer to Azkaban, so perhaps Cuarn felt intimidated by Columbus' brilliance in Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber...or perhaps Cuarn just held back from doing his own thing. Be that as it may, the change in ""direction"" really showed through. And Cuarn was gone for Goblet.

Goblet comes in with three changes in direction: 1) The director change from Cuarn back to another vet in Mike Newell (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Donnie-Brasco/dp/B000NQPZCO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Donnie Brasco</a>), 2) The exit of Columbus oversight, and 3) A shift from...shall we say...a more famlyish Harry Potter to a more dark Harry Potter (the way it was intended!). And this did not go un-noticed by the MPAA.

The Dirctor's Chair went to a relatively inexperienced David Yates for Order of the Phoenix, but at least Yates stayed the course started by Newell and kept the darkness (and the PG-13) in. Yates' directional talents are clearly inferior to his predecessors, and it really shows in Half Blood Prince. Either the main cast has lost their heart or Yates simply could not get out of his cast what they were once capable of. It is mostly Radcliffe's, Watson's, Grint's and especially Tom Felton's (Malfoy) performances that were blatantly lacking. Maybe now that this crew has grown up, it simply turns out that as adults they can't act. But that's where a more qualified director should have come in to finish off what started as a Class-A series.

It must be tough to make a PG movie these days; it's hard to believe that the MPAA took the Potter series from a PG rating to a PG-13 rating starting with Goblet. Kids 13 and under can see uglier violence and hear more profanity at school recess and at the local playground than they do in Harry Potter movies. How is it that a movie like Goblet without a curse-word or graphic act of violence (by today's standards anyway) gets thrown into the same category as, for example,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien-Vs-Predator/dp/B000K0YLLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien Vs. Predator</a>, that does indeed not only have profanity, but strong violence? Ludicrous. But I won't get started on how unfair the MPAA is and how neurotically insane the pressure is from certain groups on the MPAA to ""protect"" our youth.

I will indeed finish by saying that the Harry Potter releases combined have grossed billions of dollars because--up until Half Blood--they're excellent movies that kids can watch too. So stick that in your pipe and smoke it, MPAA. The fair MPAA rating for Half Blood would be NG. Not as Good.

Yates is on board for the final two...that's right, I said TWO...in the Harry Potter series. Deathly Hallows is announced for 2010 and Deathly Hallows Part 2 for 2011. Way to milk it, buddy. Yates had better step it up several notches and get this series back to form if he expects me to fork over the Blu Ray bucks for Hallows instead of waiting for cable.

3041416,1,B000ZECQ08,"This was absolutely the worst HP movie I have seen so far. One does not have to be familiar with the book to see the many flaws of this adaptation - from storytelling right down to acting.
The 'high-school' romance and all the potions and all - it was absolutely ridiculous to focus this much on them. And while Ron Weasley's character has always annoyed me for being one pi55y sourpuss, he got even more on my nerves when he started acting all happy.
Overall, I felt like there was about 30 mins of important material that was poorly presented and explained, and over 1.5 hrs of filler fluff that was painful to watch.
And you'd think Dan Radcliffe would get better with age, acting-wise - he got worse. I laughed throughout pretty much the whole thing, as the entire production is an absolute travesty and cannot be taken seriously.

3041422,2,B000ZECQ08,"I haven't read any of the Harry Potter books, but I thought the original movie was uniquely wonderful.  Like countless others, I was enchanted by its masterful realization of rich archetypal symbolism drawn from a combination of classic British culture and the world of magic.  It was a movie that simply had to be made.

But the subsequent movies have merely attempted to recycle the ingredients from the original, letting them become increasingly stale in the process while adding no worthwhile new elements.  Moreover, instead of being buoyantly magical, the movies have become rather dark, not just in their plot and characters, but even visually, with the original vivid colors now looking faded as though all the events took place at dusk.

This latest movie exemplifies these weaknesses.  The characters are now stereotyped and flat, the plot is unconvincing and doesn't go anywhere interesting, and the overall emotional range is stunted and narrow.  If they wanted to give up on making a good movie and instead just cash in on their lucrative franchise by resorting to fear and cool special effects, they didn't even accomplish that.  The special effects fell short of the previous movies (lowering cost to increase profit?) and boredom was the main effect I experienced.  I had to struggle just to stay awake.  In a word, this movie was drab.

I can't recommend this movie even for mindless entertainment, and I won't be watching the next one unless they somehow get their act together and garner rave reviews.",1262476800,5,1520,5.01593625498008

3041424,5,B000ZECQ08,"Harry and his friends are just a tad older in this movie. Dumbledore turns up inconveniently to spoil Harry's night out with a waitress. This sets up the beginning of a series of frustrating moments for Harry. While Dumbledore's primary mission is to defeat he who must not be named, Harry and his companions must deal with unrequited love.

I will not go into all the details due to the fact that it is fun to see them unfold as the movie progresses. However, I would say this movie has more spellbinding and snogging.

In the ongoing conflicts between book and movie we have consistently seen these movies could be, just a shadow the book in this movie is no different. Yet once again, Helena Bonham Carter plays a perfect Bellatrix.

However, after the second viewing of this movie you will notice that it is consistent and logical. The clues are all there setting you up for the future action. In addition, there is not a wasted scene or word.

I've actually seen this movie in the theater with popcorn and nachos. However, I suggest that you look at the Blu-Ray version and do not miss the extra DVD features. The main feature which is maximum movie mode is a little frustrating at first, as it requires you to press buttons and pay attention to the whole movie again. However once you get used to this feature you find that it does add to the viewers understanding of what they are trying to accomplish in the short time available for this movie.

For those viewers that are inclined to play with technology more than just being a passive viewer this Blu-Ray version also has a BD-live feature. I personally do not find this very useful.",1262390400,,1643,4.555932203389831

3041432,5,B000ZECQ08,"I enjoyed this film more than any of the other Potter films, with the possible exception of Azkaban. Like that film, it has numerous departures from the book, but viewed as part of the series of films (and NOT as a shoe-in for the book in the series of books), it works very well. I know that Rowling had approved the scripts to these films as they were made, so I'm sure that she always had a clear understanding of the consequences of any omissions (and additions) made to the events in terms of the subsequent films. So far, it has worked just fine. Are the negative Potter diehards worried that all these changes will somehow inevitably add up to a bad movie version of the ""Deathly Hallows""?

I very much enjoyed the humor. Scenes such as the tribute to Aragog were hilarious, as well as the little touches - Ron sitting between Harry and Ginny at the Burrow, and Harry being informed of Vane's love potion plans by Hermione, and the brewing of ""Living Death""! Hermione's comments about Harry ""enjoying his dessert"", and her trying to explain to Ron how he split with Lavender during his recovery from poisoning (""I don't believe it was a particularly long conversation"") are also hilariously low key. Lavender's attentions to Ron are comical, and deliberately pitched as almost painful. The effects are convincing, and the actors have hit their stride.

3041434,4,B000ZECQ08,"Based on the sixth book in J.K Rowling's ""Harry Potter"" series, ""The Half-Blood Prince"" first hit the big screen in 2009.

Orphaned as a baby and subsequently raised (in the loosest possible terms) by his Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, Harry's early years were thoroughly miserable. Although he had been told his parents had died in a car crash, they were actually murdered by an evil wizard called Voldemort. Harry, however, somehow survived this attack and Voldemort subsequently disappeared for many years. Harry learnt of his past when he was eleven, and has since been attending Hogwarts - a very prestigious school for training young witches and wizards. The years in between have provided him with some of the happiest moments of his life : he has made friends for the first time - including Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger - and he has become the Seeker on Gryffindor's Quidditch team. The school's headmaster Albus Dumbledore, considered by many to be the greatest wizard of modern times, has become something of a role model to him. Unfortunately, it has also become apparent that Voldemort's disappearance was only temporary - and, while many in the wizarding world have tried to pretend otherwise, his return cannot now be ignored. Furthermore, Harry has now been identified as the `Chosen One' and is destined to battle with Voldemort again - with only one of the two surviving. Despite the enhanced security at Hogwarts, however, Harry can't feel entirely safe there. Professor Snape, the Potions teacher who has picked on Harry from the day he arrived, was a once noted Death Eater...and, despite Dumbledore's assurances, Harry has never trusted him. Draco Malfoy, Harry's arch-nemesis among the student body, is the son of another noted Death Eater...and Harry believes Draco is now following in his father's footsteps. As it turns out, Harry's suspicions may not be entirely groundless...

The film opens with Dumbledore surprising Harry wait a visit, towards the end of the summer holidays...and taking him onwards, to meet a former colleague called Professor Horace Slughorn. Dumbledore hopes he will return to the teaching staff - and has brought Harry along as `bait'. (He has a record of `collecting' talented young witches and wizards - and Dumbledore knows he wouldn't be able to resist Harry). Naturally, he caves in...though a return to Hogwarts would be a great relief to him. Voldemort - who also features in Slughorn's collection of notable past pupils - has desperately been trying to add him to the Death Eaters.

When he arrives back at Hogwarts, however, Harry's surprised to learn Slughorn is taking over as Potions teacher - with Snape finally taking over the Defence Against the Dark Arts job. The shuffle also means that Harry will be able to take both subjects - both are needed for him to become an Auror. (Snape had threatened to keep him out of the NEWT-level Potions class, for not achieving the top grade at OWL Level. Slughorn, on the other hand, is more than happy to accept him). Since he hadn't bought any books for the Potions course in Diagon Alley, Harry borrows an old copy of the textbook from the classroom's store. It puts Harry at an immediate advantage over his classmates, thanks to some very helpful notes made by its previous owner...someone who called himself the 'Half-Blood Prince'. Harry is also getting some additional 'classes' with Dumbledore - where he learns more about Voldemort's past. However, they're not very regular as Dumbledore seems to be spending a lot of time away from Hogwarts....and there is a little homework, that involves working closely with Slughorn.

Unsurprisingly, given the length of the book, not everything makes it into the film. While some of Harry's lessons with Dumbledore are dropped, and there's no mention of Grimmauld Place, the changes and the omissions at the film's climax surprised me most of all...there were a couple of scenes there, I'd have thought, would have been a film-maker's dream. Nevertheless, looking at the film in isolation - rather than comparing it to the book - I did find it very enjoyable. It was very dark and stylish, while Helena Bonham Carter was - once again - outstanding in her far-too-brief appearance as Bellatrix. (I wish something had been done to extend her screen-time. A bit more of Luna would've been welcomed too). Malfoy is no longer the strutting, preening bully, and clearly struggles with what's expected of him throughout the year. Overall, I enjoyed it - while the Potter diehards mightn't be too happy with it, I found it a fun way to pass a couple of hours.",1262217600,,4607,4.963730569948186

The story line made no sense to me and left so many loose ends which can only be tied up by another Harry Potter book/movie, which I hear there won't be.  I for the first time felt I wasted my precious time watching it.  In fact a couple days later I thought maybe it was me so I watched it again, it isn't me, the movie stinks.

Video/Audio:

My copy played flawlessly and the video and audio qualities were both top notch.  I did not notice any of the artifacts and such that others have commented on.

Packaging/Contents:

I'm not a huge fan of the ""sleeves"" that a lot of Blu-Rays (and DVD's for that matter) are packaged in, but the holographic affect on the H.P. cover is well done.  I was extremely happy and satisified that in addition to the BD and the Digital Copy, the DVD is also included.  I wish all Blu-Rays came with the DVD as this is a great thing to have for those of us with DVD in our auto's, or those that vacation to places with DVD players.

As for the movie itself, I'll leave the review of it to the HP experts out there.  I will state that I feel a lot of the books contents are changed and/or missing to make the story more streamlined and for the sake of brevity.",1262131200,2,993,4.295698924731183

Let us forget that this is a hugely popular hit series in book and movie form as a stand alone film I felt robbed of my money and my time. I will not spoil anything, but understand this, MAJOR plot points are just skipped. If they made the movie for people that read the books and knew what was going on, and didn't really want to see the things happen on the big screen, the succeeded. This huge failure succeeds at making me want to get rid of the entire series it is so horrible. Major scenes were missing, and one major event was made to be so lack-luster, that I actually laughed out loud. When the film was over, my wife even went, ""That's it?"" Yes dear, that is the end of 2 and 1/2 hours of the worst rendition of a book to film. Now, do not tell me how movies and books differ, I understand that. But to complete omit major story points is completely unforgivable. And, if you are going to give me 150 minutes of film, do not add things that are not in the story and have nothing to do with the series. Actually, one complete waste of celluloid contradicts the series in a 5 minutes fight scene that is, well, not there in the books. The added scene even creates an issue for the next film. I had to explain everything that ""really"" happened to my wife, who was left completely clueless as to what was going on because this film says nothing about the real story. Just because it says Harry Potter, do not think that the entire world is going to invest their monies into your product. Stephen King made that mistake with his Dark Tower series. Improve these mistakes in the next film, or you will completely lose your audience before the summer of 2011 when the final film is released.

3041441,4,B000ZECQ08,"One difficulty about any Harry Potter film is that the books are far richer,  So it is with the latest in the saga.  The film follows the basic storyline of the book, but some details are perhaps necessarily sidestepped.  Harry's growing attraction toward Ginny Weasley is minimized, as is Harry's struggle with the fact that she's his best friend's sister and how Harry is troubled as to how any budding romance might affect his friendship is mostly missing.  Likewise, the setup for Harry using the beozar is effectively absent, where in the book, it's prominent.  The film does carry the fundamental story along, but some of the things that were in the original are minimized or missing.
The film carries the basic storyline along, but it sheds some important details.  The whole subplot about Mrs. Weasley, Bill Weasley, and Fleur is missing, and that Fleur and Bill's impending weddingis an important element for the final story.  I have read that the final book, ""Deathly Hallows,"" will take more than one film.

Sadly, even the 3 cups of coffee I had today could barely keep me awake for this dreadful, dull  and horribly depicted film.  How it is possible that a franchise with as much going for it as Harry Potter could allow this to happen?

My own two cents:
1.  There was way too much time spent on and with Horace Slugworth.  He had no fire and to watch all his onscreen time was an exercise in patience.
2.  One of my favorite story lines in the book was Tom Riddle's family.  They were so well written and interesting, they could have taken 15 minutes of time from Sluggy and that unfunny running gag of Ron's stalking admirer and invested us in getting to know Tom's people.
3.  I understand the books/films get darker as they progress.  I get this however one of the things I have always loved was the whimsical and magical objects and beings such as Nearly Headless Nick, Moaning Myrtle, moving staircases, howlers and talking paintings.  It's like this was no longer Hogwarts, a school of wizardry but a broken down castle with no element of anything magical.
4.  There are always going to be people who complain about what the film didn't cover and what was in the film but not the book but if you're going to tamper with a book such as HP, MAKE IT INTERESTING.

Let's do this one over.  Can we please?

My older daughter has read the books twice and the younger one finished the last one last May. That being said I will review their reaction to both the movie and the product, since Amazon insists on combining the actual movie content and multiple product format reviews.

BD Live - Blu-ray disc review: I have read the negative product reviews for this disc complaining about the verticle lines running across the screen. We didn't observe any of this in the copy we received. After reading about the problem I went back and played it again to see if I missed something. Our copy is crisp and clear, everything you would expect from Blu-ray. I noted that the originator of one of these negative reviews provided a subsequent comment that Warner Brothers promptly replaced her disc with a good one, so this must have been a batch problem. We were just lucky I guess. I pre-ordered this disc back in early November at a great price of $15.99. It arrived in plenty of time before Chrismas. Well worth the money.

Movie Review: I enjoyed the movie, having never read the books. I thought it was one of the better movies of the series. My daughters also enjoyed it, however they were dissapointed and downright irate at several points when the movie took off on tangents; like substituting the wrong character for certain scenes, leaving out whole sections, and adding entirely new scenes that were not in the book at all. I can sympathize with their frustration. I have never understood why screen writers feel the need to create completely new content scenes for movie adaptations while dropping valid scenes.",1262044800,24,1697,4.749152542372881
3041446,4,B000ZECQ08,"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince was good, as it (most of the time) stayed true to the novels, with some little sit-com like additions (which I personally am not so fond of). A word of warning: If you have very small children (5,6) they may be frightened by some of the more intense scenes. This IS the darkest Harry Potter movie yet, and you have to keep in mind that the movies get progressively darker, so the next two (as the seventh book is being split into to different releases) will only be darker.

A note on the soundtrack:  I found myself turning it the volume up and down at different points in the movie, as win they whisper it trails off into nothi.... and when the yell it GETS REALLY LOUD!!!! It's inevitable that this happens, I've spoken with others who complain of the same problem.

3041448,3,B000ZECQ08,"I'm an avid Harry Potter fan, like so many.  This film is definitely a ""cliff notes"" version of the book; probably best if you've read the book beforehand.  (It would have had to be a miniseries to fit in all that the book covers.)  The tone is extremely dark, as the story goes on.  The film is visually dark itself-especially on a smaller screen.  You'll have to dim the lights for some of the scenes at home just to see what is going on.

When I saw the film in theatres, I was dismayed by many of the cuts from the book, and I didn't like the ""new"" scenes.  I still feel that way to an extent, but over time I think I realize that some changes had to be made for pacing and sheer time.  I do think this is an amazing cast, and it's been a treat to watch the kids grow into their roles along with their characters.  I was especially impressed by Tom Felton-who finally had more of a role than comic relief.

I was disappointed that this DVD has NO extras whatsoever.  I don't need 30 hours of behind the scenes stuff, but buyers of this version should know that there is nothing but the movie on this DVD.  No commentary, no interviews, nada.  It's just the film.  I think that they are starting to ""force"" people to buy the deluxe blue ray versions, and I resent that.

All films adapted from books make changes and this is especially true in the Harry Potter series where so many characters exist and the story is both a coming of age teen book and a minor fantasy epic. The problem with the Half Blood Prince is that it does neither well as a film. They added utterly nonsense scenes like the destruction of the Weasley home while doing away with so much of Harry's interactions with his peers like Luna, Neville and even Ginny. Additionally, the way they filmed the movie it makes an incredibly poor showing on home video as it is very dark, not just in setting and tone but the picture as well. Playing it on my smaller television left me utterly incapable of even seeing the picture at times, something that does not happen with any other movie in my collection. All in all, while Half Blood Prince was one of my favorite of the books it is easily the worst of the series and should really only be purchased if you are, like me, the sort of person who has to have the entire collection.",1261785600,5,1118,4.3798076923076925

I left somewhat thrilled AND disappointed. Why? For a few reasons, just look at the other reviews here and you will see that about half of them are positive and half negative. They left quite a bit of what I would think is important material from the book which is sad and ruined the experience for many fans and it could have been one closer to the book. It's going to be hard to make the last two HP movies because of this. On the good side the special effects were great and the scenes that were present from the book are great and besides HP 6 being very dark it's also very funny at times and the movie looked amazing. The acting was mostly good I've got no complaints here. It seems each year the movies get darker and this one is really dark, I think it's great and it makes a progression from a movie to another. They clearly didn't follow the book enough like a fan would have wanted but I want to make it clear that didn't prevent me from liking this movie and even buying it. When watching the excellent special features, you may notice how some deleted scenes should have made it to the final cut. Besides all that, there is only so much time in a movie that can't include everything they might have wanted to. I'm not only a fan of the books but a fan of the movies as well and I don't think this one is bad at all, it should have stuck more to the book it's true but the result is still a great movie.",1261699200,,1579,4.11326860841424
3041458,3,B000ZECQ08,"With a unique title slapped across it's glossy face, ""Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"" is the sixth movie in the world of adapting the wildly popular book series into blockbusters. I originally saw it in theaters (in a special, chaotic midnight showing, in fact, which will be the first and last one I attend) and thought I loved it. But when I recently purchased it, upon seeing it released into DVD format, and re-watched it, I fluttered down from my cloud and realized it was, sadly, less than perfect.

Being a movie of beautiful cinematography and amazing computer graphics, it is far from being a fail. Do not listen to the parts of the audience who wailed about it being too different from the book- it's called an ""adaption"", not ""an exact replica of the popular book"" for a reason- it is indeed a good movie. And yet I felt it didn't succeed as well as I expected it to, as much as a HP movie should have.

The movie has some definite slow and dry parts; parts that I admit I fast-forwarded through, since my memories from the silver screening in July aren't frayed yet. There was a bit too much dialog; it ran a bit too long; some sequences were, admittedly, twisted a bit too drastically from the book. Not exactly in a bad way, but in a weird way.

For example, they destroy the Weasley's home in this movie. What?! I was baffled as I saw it collapse before me- well, on the screen before me. And the ending, where instead of Dumbledore freezing Harry motionless, Harry is left capable of stopping Draco and Snape, yet stands below and does quite nothing.

But I decided against complaining, because it is still a winning movie. It has some clever, funny parts- parts that are certainly aimed towards it's chunk of the audience that are teens and young adults- and I love how dark it has gotten. It was filmed grainer, too, and I love the feel it shimmers towards the audience. The actors all did well, I thought, and overall, I found myself shutting off the DVD player with a refreshed sense of easiness, yet not completely satisified.

So as I wrap up my review, I think I can easily say this- not the best Harry Potter movie out there, but a far cry from the worst. A very good one to buy, but perhaps not golden enough to slip the brittle words ""classic"" and ""beloved"" over it's cover.",1261699200,,2308,4.446808510638298

The special effects are second to none, and the ""how-it-was-made segments  are amazing! The other features were also very interesting, using the main actors to show us around the sets etc.

I can't wait for the final episode next summer, because this movie has enough possible endings to make it potentially tantalizing!

In case anyone is wondering why I have not divulged any of the movie details, it is because I would like everyone to see the movie. Just make sure you watch all the other movies first to understand the characters and the ongoing plot.

Still, as a movie, it's damned boring and more murky than ""dark"". The characters wander around aimlessly until I reached the point where I not only did not know what was going on, but, more than that, I no longer cared. The principle child actors have not aged well. Daniel Radcliffe mumbles incoherently, Rupert Grint consistently looks like he needs a bath and detox. and Emma Watson, though quite a beauty, appears shallow and clueless. It's now very apparent that these three have no real future as adult actors.

I spent most of the movie gritting my teeth over the horrendous miscasting of Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. I can't believe that they couldn't find anyone who was closer to the style and demeanor of the late Richard Harris. Gambon, who was quoted as saying, ""I just play me"" appears incoherent and senile and apparently doesn't know that no one is really interested in watching him play himself. I suspect that Rowling killed Dumbledore off in the books because it was the only way to get rid of Gambon. He's really that bad!

As said over and over by the one and two star writers... this movie was really not that great- which is really disappointing since the book was amazing. I totally understand editing and transfer but so much was cut out or cut down that to someone who has chosen to watch the movies and not read the books- the movie can be awfully confusing.

I felt like allot of the main and important characters were sort of cut off. This book really gives you insight into both Snape and Voldermont but the movie failed to do so.

Further more the lighting wasn't the greatest - my partner and I literally had to turn off all the lights in order to see everything that was going on.

As stated by another reviewer was by far the best (in my opinion) film so far created from the book.

3041467,4,B000ZECQ08,"Being a Harry Potter fan of the first two movies then moving onto the books, I have to say I am a fan of the books first and the movies second. For those of you that haven't read the books though, the movies are still great if that's the only way for you to get your ""Potter Geek On.""

With that being said, book readers have to realize that there is no way to be 100% true to the books. The movie would be so expensive to do, plus they have to be able to have their ""creative license"" with it. They have to draw people who don't read the books into the theater. I am also one of those haters that get so mad when something was changed completely or not even in the movie, which IMO should have been.

The first movie is still my favorite, the second one I felt was a bit boring, the third was done fairly well considering, the fourth kept me on a ""high"" almost the whole time but was very disappointing with how much they left out (hell-O... I was SO looking forward to the world cup in the beginning, it really set the stage for the rest of the book) I think they slaughtered this one, the fifth wasn't as true as it could have been but it was also one of the most boring books in the series IMO so it was bittersweet, the sixth is probably my second favorite honestly though it too lacked a lot of information that I feel was needed to go into the seventh book.

We book nerds have to realize they can't do it 100% perfect and have take it with a grain of salt, but that doesn't mean we can't pause the movie and fill in the blanks or tell it how it should be!!",1261353600,,1564,4.006410256410256

Plot: kids, evil castle/school, odd teachers, Harry, Ron, a little girl named Hermione, some bad ass dude name Voldemort, a fat dude named Hagrid, etc.  What's great is if you've seen the other films, you can watch this and not pay attention.

There are so many key scenes left out and strange ones put in that make no sense, I wondered at times if the film was of the book I'd read. ""Based on a novel by..."" is only too true. And don't get me started on the 17 minutes of game ads, trailers and other rubbish that are impossible to fast forward over before you are finally allowed to see what you paid for.

However, I will mention that the sound quality on the Blu-ray received was particularly poor, at least through the first 30 minutes or so.  The TV volume had to be cranked up to almost full just to barely be able to hear any dialog.  After a while, the movie volume improved and the TV volume could be lowered a bit.  There were several dark scenes that were too dark, making the viewing quite difficult.  For the most part, I don't see much point in buying the Blu-ray version of this movie, primarly due to the crummy sound reproduction and a dark video making Blu-ray moot.  This version that came from Amazon was missing the digital copy of the movie, but Amazon has recognized the problem and will apparently be sending out a free copy of the widescreen DVD.  Hopefully, the sound quality will be better on the DVD.",1261267200,3,944,4.4476744186046515

3041473,3,B000ZECQ08,"My wife & I are both ""Potter'ites"" and liked the Half Blood Prince a lot.  It was much darker than previous Potter movies both visually and in mood.  The movie lacks nearly all of the humor found in the book (which we've read several times).  My brother, who hasn't read the book, watched the movie and thought, ""HUH?""  It didn't make any sense to him.

In watching the film a second time I can understand his confusion. If you haven't read the book, there are too many gaps.  This book is unique in that Harry is not involved in a single clear-cut mission against Voldermort and his followers.  Instead, the book details a whole host of events that seem intended to tie up loose ends and set the stage for the final one.  In compressing 652 pages into 153 minutes, the movie isn't able to establish a tie between these various situations and events as well as the book: In fact it hardly tries.  It feels more like a 153 minute ""Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"" book teaser... a series of unrelated snippets designed to lure you into buying and reading it.

If you're familiar with the book, you'll fill in the gaps and enjoy the ride. If not, you'll likely have a ""HUH?"" reaction like my brother.",1261267200,2,1205,4.4363636363636365
3041474,1,B000ZECQ08,"The widescreen DVD disc that I bought was so poorly produced that it was dark and faded throughout...up to the point where the disc stuttered, ground to halt, and refused to play any further.  There is nothing wrong with my Sony player: all my other discs play perfectly well.  The disc production had the appearance of an illegal rip-off or some low-bid, over-seas production.  I was offered a refund but not a replacement, leading me to think that I was not the first person who encountered these problems.  Locally, I heard that several other people had returned their discs to the stores where they bought them.

As for the movie itself, it does not stand alone as the earlier films did.  It has the appearance of being merely a transition between the previous film and the next. Despite the problem of the book being long and allotted theater viewing time limited, other reviewers' criticisms about omitted, essential scenes have merit.  Any person caught up in the Harry Potter craze will have to see this film; however, I am not convinced that everyone would care to see it again.",1261180800,2,1087,4.75

3041476,4,B000ZECQ08,"So how is Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince? I thought it was great and worth the delay. It has a few problems, but its good points outweigh its bad ones by far.

The movie vesion of Half-Blood Prince is easily the one of the darkest Potter films (apparently the rating doesn't matter very much) but it is also one of the most humorous. The film features performances from Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson that are all excellent with other great performances by Michael Gambon and Jim Broadbent, as well. The film, particularly the memory scenes, make marvelous use of dark greens and gray colors with plenty of special effects to recreate the grim atmosphere of the book. Frank Dillane is perfect in his performance as the teenage Voldemort during some of the flashbacks, creating a reserved scariness while maintaining the squeaky-clean appearance of Tom Riddle. Yet the movie balances the creepy parts with the funny scenes, mainly involving the relationship between Ron and Lavender Brown. Director David Yates improves his skills since the last film with a more involving and entertaining one here.

What confused me was the choice of what was taken out and what was added to the film. As with all book-based films, some edits were necessary to allow the movie to have a smooth run time (which never feels too long), while others make very little sense at all. Most of the memory scenes were completely removed, leaving only the ""essentials"". I wonder how they will explain a Horcrux such as Hufflepuff's Cup without the part included in book 6 that reveals its significance. I could not figure out why the fight scene at The Burrow was added, but I didn't mind. Perhaps to achieve a run time of about 2 1/2  hours, the film feels as though it were heavily edited in some scenes.

While not completely flawless, the filmmakers achieved what they set out to do very well with the sixth installment in the Harry Potter series. Check it out, this movie is definitely worthwhile!",1261180800,,1981,4.80058651026393

For those people who want to diss the movie for not following the book exactly, lighten up. I doubt you would be able to do any better. This movie was already long. With any more added scences the movie could become TOO long, and people need to understnad that its incredibly unrealistic to think movie producers will follow every step and chapter in the book. If viewers would just watch the movie without all those prejuduces they might actually see what great movies they are and be able to enjoy them!

O.K., this movie was very well produced. It made me laugh, cry, and captivated me throughout. The actors truly shone in this movie!! I would recommend that viewers watch the preceding movies first, to truly capture the whole gist of the plot. So, for those people who left not-so-good comments..... If these movies were meant to be watched out of order the Half blood prince wouldnt be labeled the sixth movie!! Is it really that big of a deal to watch them in chronological order?!

These movies have such an intricate plot and dynamic theme that they stand out among thousands. I highly suggest viewers watch this movie and read the books if you haven't already!!!! =)",1261180800,3,1264,4.638392857142857

Some of the best Tom Riddle's best memories are left out of this one.  Harry's inheritance of Sirius Black's home and house elf, an important part of understanding Regulis Black, is also left out.  Voldemort's own maternal and paternal histories, as well of what he thought of his mother has been left out.  There are so many things left out of this movie that made J.K. Rowling's book so good that I think as fans, we should demand a redo!!!
The one bright spot in this movie, however, is Alan Rickman (Snape).  In his face you could see his concern for all of the students involved in the inner circles of Voldemort and Dumbledore.",1261094400,,806,4.382550335570469

A bluray disk...the end. Where is my DVD version? Where is my digital copy access code? Why is Amazon stealing my money and thinks it is ok? Well, it's not. In my ""Orders"" page, it says the Bluray combo is what I purchased...now this page has changed to what I received -- a Bluray disk. I don't care about BD Live options. I want a DVD to watch in my laptop. According to other review the digital copy only works on media players I do not own, so I'm not too upset over that. I just want what I clearly ordered. Is that too much to ask? That's why I purchase directly from Amazon. I want to avoid receiving wrong products, not purposefully get a random movie.

I have a feeling that because this was available for pre-order for a few weeks, Amazon ran out and just shipped this version.

I still want a DVD version as I paid for one!

UPDATE 12/19/09: I received an email from Amazon that stated some customers purchased the Bluray/DVD combo w/ digital copy during a promotional stage and it was never removed from the website. Since I was one of those customers, they are giving me a promo code to buy the DVD for free and get the Amazon digital copy (you can watch it on your computer w/o an internet connection if you download the Amazon Unbox player, which I did -- we'll see how good it is once the movie finishes) so in a sense, I'm getting what I paid for. I'm glad Amazon rectified the situation within 3 days. That was very nice. Thank you!

UPDATE 01/02/10: I watched the movie. It was alright. Like others have said, the previous movies were better. It was pretty slow for the majority of the film. You could probably just watch the first 20 minutes and then the last 45 and not miss much. I hope the finally is better.

3041482,4,B000ZECQ08,"As the Harry Potter series continued, each story got bigger and bigger. Honestly the first book was a 'juvenile' book, the last book was, well, anything but a juvenile. J.K. Rowling did an wonderful job of 'maturing' the focus and tone of the books as Harry Potter grew up. That is why the series works so well, in my opinion.
But the movies struggled with the 'bigness' of the books all along. The old 'what to leave in, what to leave out' conundrum was evident from the first movie. By 'Goblet', there were solid 'chunks' of the books that were dropped or just touched on - if you had not read the books, it was hard to really follow who and what etc and especially why things were moving the way they were.
The scope of the books was literally staggering, that grandness is not so evident in the movies. Starting with 'Goblet', I would argue that each movie probably could have been much longer or better two movies rather easily - which in fact the approach they are taking with 'Hallows'.
So to review 'Prince', the movie is ok in my opinion - just hard to follow plot-wise especially if you are a big fan of the book. But I think there was just too much left out - really the plot is there, mostly, but no where near as deep and rich as the book. I would like to imagine that there is a 'director's cut' out there somewhere - maybe with 30 or 60 minutes more screen time - which fully displays the true 'magic' of the story itself.
Again, I do not want to be too negative here, this is an epic story and would be a toughie to film, I guess, like LOTR, you have to credit the films for being made in the first place. BY all means, just read the books and then see the films.",1261094400,,1679,4.201238390092879

So I picked it up and from the left side, it looks like Harry and Dumbledore. I know it's trivial but its the little things I try to smile about.

If you've read the book you probably spent a good majority of the movie going ""where did that scene go?"" and yes there is a lot missing. The Half-Blood prince was simply too dense of a book to fit into a 2 hour movie. A lot of the book is building up to what happens and unfolds in the final book, I would have rather seen this film in two parts then leave out scenes (or add scenes like they did). I think for this movie to be fully enjoyed and understood, you would definitely need to read the book.

Spoilers Ahead (actually if you read the book these aren't spoilers, just things you might have noticed are missing): These are just some of the more important scenes that are left out: The final Hogwarts battle, Dumbledore's funeral, Sirius' property being stolen, Harry and Ginny's relationship and its ending, where are the older Weasley boys?. There are other parts that are gone, other reviewers have already touched on them.

I did give this movie four stars because I feel it did deserve it. One star because its a Harry Potter film, I enjoy the series. Another star for the chemistry between everyone.  It was great, especially now since they are coming of age, hormones are running wild and love is blossoming, its a normal part of growing up. It also provided a great balance to the darkness that overtook the movie. Another star for the emotional conflict of Malfoy, it was excellent. He was able to get more screen time and we see his internal battle. And the last star for, the acting. I think everyone did a great job portraying the emotion or lack there of in the film. Except the ending, I felt more emotional reading the book than what came across on the screen.  After a slight let down of this movie, now the wait begins for Nov 2010 for part 1 of the Deathly Hallows (or maybe not since it's the same director).",1261008000,14,2113,4.352791878172589

No such problem with any other DVDs).  It's much too dark and required setting TV brightness and backlight to maximum values; which tends to be a bit washed-out. If you don't, many parts of the movie are black.  Several other sections are actually grainy in HD! Sound is mediocre.  Theatrical release quality was obviously much compromised (maybe the Blu-ray is better?).

The movie attempts to combine multiple plot threads and coming-of-age for the teenagers.  A very poor attempt that comes off with many loose fragments and distractions.  Unlike the other movies in the series, plot coherency is all but lost. Harry Potter fans may be able to put things together from the book, but others will find this movie impossible to follow.  The movie also assumes you've seen the previous movies so you know the characters and will likely buy the next so this one will actually finish.

THe idea that we weren't aware that there was a deep friendship between the trio is laughable.  The HBP is devoted to the discovery that Tom has used items to split his soul and that the mission is to destroy them.  The book has detailed many trips into past memories to learn about Tom's progression to evil and insights into how he got there.  I was shocked and disappointed to watch this be turned into a story that focuses on the obvious and leaves out so many details that made this book fantastic and creates the hurry and anxiety of the 7th book/movie.  This could have been a fantastic movie but I believe that so many of the good reviewers are just in love with the story enough that it hurts them to rate the movie poorly, I know that my instinct tells me that I should give it 2 stars but I can't bring myself to do it.

3041489,4,B000ZECQ08,"""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" was by far the weakest of J.K. Rowling's books, so I didn't have high expectations for the movie. I only hoped that the filmmakers would take this opportunity to correct some of the book's problems with editing and character writing. I wasn't disappointed. Like the book, this film seems more of a segway between Year 5 and Year 7 than an independent adventure. But Harry Potter is not as passive as in the novel, where he seemed to be drained of personality. The students' social lives don't strain credibility, and the scenario is not drowned in filler. There is filler -make no mistake. The film could easily be cut by 40 minutes. But the superfluous scenes give the audience more time to enjoy the wacky wizarding world and to see some familiar characters, so people will probably not complain too much about the length.

As Year 6 at Hogwarts begins, menace is in the air. Wizards and muggles alike are terrorized by Voldemort's Death-Eaters. People are disappearing. Hogwarts has taken security measures to protect the students. Headmaster Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) has convinced Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent) to come out of retirement to teach Potions -or rather he has allowed Harry Potter's (Daniel Radcliffe) presence at the school to influence Slughorn, who prides himself on having taught all the most famous wizards and their children. But Dumbledore wants something more from Slughorn, a secret that he believes essential to defeating the Dark Lord. Young Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), meanwhile, sneaks around Hogwarts in a constant state of anxiety on account of a mysterious mission he has been entrusted to carry out for the Dark Lord.

Not a lot goes on in the ""Half-Blood Prince"". It's primarily a set-up for the finale in Year 7. The pace is slower than usual, but the film manages more suspense than the book. Director David Yates has made it very snowy at Hogwarts for a white-out effect. The palette is appropriately drab as the world teeters on chaos. The book's single strength was the scenes of Voldemort/Tom Riddle's origins and youth. Unfortunately, those receive spare treatment in the film. That's too bad, because we need to know more about Voldemort in order for him to become a full-fledged character before the final showdown. A script for the ""Half-Blood Prince"" is tricky, as the book has multiple plot threads that lead nowhere (for the moment). But Voldemort's past could have been integrated without completely losing cohesion. That's the one major flaw in a film that otherwise is an improvement over the book.",1261008000,,2593,5.0

The first three were excellent in every way - from the scripting to the acting, special effects, character development, etc.  No. 4 (Goblet of Fire) was okay - but gratituous and vivid violence - not a kid's movie.  No. 5 redeemed itself somewhat, but felt sketchy and showed little or no character development.  Alas - my high hopes for #6 were dashed.  Very slow start left me waiting for something - ANYTHING to happen - very disjointed.  As I continued watching, I saw a few small redeeming story lines emerge, but the character development was missing.  Again, the script was disjointed - and the violence still more mature than a 10-year-old should see.  All this movie did was to confirm two of my suspicions about two prominent characters.  No - I won't be a spoiler and tell you what happens.  We're lucky that the script revealed anything at all! Please, Harry - graduate from Hogwarts!",1260835200,4,959,4.72289156626506

I thought it was a lot better than previous movies in the way it progressed the story, and in the acting and dialog. The other movies always seemed to have parts where the acting and dialog were cheesy and corny. Those parts are gone in this movie and as such it seems much more well done and maturer, especially the acting. This movie is also outstanding on blu ray. I HIGHLY recommend getting it in blu ray if you can, it's simply amazing.",1260835200,,530,4.31
3041499,4,B000ZECQ08,"While I would agree with the purists out there who felt somewhat cheated by this film leaving out vital details that are integral to the nature of Voldemort and his motivation while adding in three time consuming scenes that added nothing to the story whatsoever.  I also understand that movies have time constraints and studios don't want movies to be too long because that cuts down on the number of times the movie can be shown thus cutting into profits.  I get it.

*****MILD SPOILERS BE AHEAD******
I would have rather seen the memory of Tom Riddle trying to get on as the Defense against the Dark Arts teacher but being turned away which is the reason the post is now cursed than the Bridge Collapse scene.  Or Maybe the Dursleys at the beginning where Harry inherits Grimauld Place and Kreacher all at once instead of Harry chatting up a waitress at a train station.  Or some explanation as to the fact that the remaining Horcruxes would be tied to the Hogwarts founders because of how important Hogwarts was to Voldemort or maybe Dumbledore's funeral instead of the attack on the burrough.  And Harry not being petrified on the astronomy tower is just unforgiveable.  Lots of stuff that come part 7 isn't going to make a whole lot of sense if it is just dropped in out of nowhere.
*****NO MORE SPOILERS*****

All that being said the movie is still really good and very well made It just seems like they made it because they felt like they had to instead of truly wanting to bridge the gap to the final chapter in the saga.  3+ stars for the actual movie.

Where it gets the extra star is for the amazing bonus features that I haven't even gotten the opportunity to scratch the surface of yet.  The brief but excellent featurette on the Deathly Hallows is outstanding.  The deleted scenes are okay.  A couple that could and probably SHOULD have been left in the final film.  The featurette on the Wizarding World opening up at Universal Orlando next year has me completely geeked to go.  They are outstanding.

So to sum it up.  If you are a Harry Potter fan and enjoyed the movie even a little bit definately pick this up if for nothing else than the extra bonus features.  If you hated the movie but are still a fan see if you can borrow a copy to watch the bonus stuff.  It's worth every minute spent.",1260835200,2,2311,4.485645933014354

What does that mean?  The dark (and moody) scenes that appear shadowed and contrasted on a 30 foot screen show up as a black, blank screen, extremely low-definition as if my 32"" high-resolution television screen had just been turned off.  No, I don't have to change the contrast setting on my television for my other 1600 odd DVDs, and I am not about to change those settings for this one movie!

I am only glad that Walmart started their price war for one singular reason.  I only ended up paying $10 for this all but unwatchable (in parts) DVD.  Unfortunately, Warner Bros. doesn't really care, but you should!  When you pay good money for a DVD movie, you should expect some quality.  You won't find that here.

3041503,1,B000ZECQ08,"What is it about Harry Potter movies that make them so unmemorable?  Obviously it can't be the source material.  The beloved series by J.K. Rowling is pure magic, no pun intended.  Still, as a fan of the books, I watch each film, excited each time around to see the story of Harry Potter unfold on the big screen.  I'm not sure what I'm expecting from these films.  I mean, they are adaptions of a book.  In my opinion, books are always better than their movie counterparts.  The Lord of the Rings trilogy might be the only exception in my mind, but that's another story.

What has frustrated me about the movies are the missed opportunities, and I'm not even talking about scenes from the books that didn't make the films.  Here's an example:

In Order of the Phoenix, the climactic battle at the end of the film between the Death Eaters and The Order culminates in the timely arrival of Dumbledore.  In the book, this is nothing short of a ""Gandalf On A White Horse"" moment.  He arrives as the battle seems lost, and kicks some serious tail. In the film, he walks out of a fireplace like he just woke up from a nap.

In this latest film, The Half-blood Prince, we see more of the same.  Once again, a battle sequence at the end of the book finds all hell breaking loose at Hogwarts, after Dumbledore... well... You know.  Instead the Death Eaters just casually walk out of the school, as if it were a passing period.  What makes this an even greater insult is that the filmmakers decide to add a scene that wasn't in the book, and frankly, serves NO PURPOSE.  The ""Attack On The Burrow"", as it has come to be known, makes no sense.  It accomplishes nothing.  It doesn't advance the plot.

The filmmakers have one more chance to get it right with the Deathly Hallows.

I really hope they do.",1260748800,6,1792,4.418960244648318

At the end of the book, when Severus yells at Harry... ""don't call me coward!""  That is a climactic moment and it was completely left out of the movie!
The whole backstory of Voldemorts mother and childhood  are left out.

I also like the bonus features of this BD, it's so much better than those of other titles.

3041512,4,B000ZECQ08,"I had difficulties with the Bluray disk.  Ultimately I had to download a firmware upgrade (version 2.1) for my early generation Samsung P-1400 player.  Since my player is not connected to the internet, the download was made to a CD and then to the player.  I had trouble with the unzip function and then with transferring the upgrade file to the CD.  The first two attempts produced a CD unrecognizable by the player.  Through trial and error I produced a CD that worked with the player. The actual upgrade took place smoothly with instructions on the TV screen.  The final result allowed me to play the movie but the limitations of the P-1400 could not give me access to all the features of the three disks in the Bluray edition.  Also the effect of dark shading and other artistic aspects of the film diminished the full effect of the 1080p screen image.  I recommend that buyers of the Bluray version who have older players take the time to download the latest firmware updates from their player's manufacturer and install them before taking an hour or so trying to make the Bluray work or to returning them to Amazon.

The negative and positive reviews here of The Half Blood Prince are generally valid depending on what the reviewer expected.  The film's limitations were dependent upon the complexity of the book and the time limitations for a feature film.  Much of The Half Blood Prince is dependent upon the viewers' knowledge of the books and previous Potter movies.  As such,  The Half Blood Prince does not do well as a stand alone feature film.  I am sure time limitations also caused numerous scene deletions and compromises with the story line.  Nonetheless, this movie provides a thoroughly enjoyable next installment in the Potter series.  All of the actors provided excellent performances.  Humor and comic relief were provided by the coming of age mishaps of Potter and crew in an otherwise moody and somber story.  I think the directors could have emphasized suspense more as opposed to fear and the dark mood.

3041513,4,B000ZECQ08,"I've reserved my review of Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince until now for several reasons.  I learned my lesson after first hating the Prisoner of Azkaban and then realizing it was the best of the Potter movie series after seeing it the second time. After three viewings of HFP, I still have some major issues with the altering of the plot but have discovered that it isn't as bad as I first thought when coming out of the movie theater.

Like most Potter fans who have read all the books, I sorely miss the subplots involving Fleur, Bill and Charlie, Tonks and Lupin.  I hate that Tonks wasn't the one to rescue Harry from the train.  I balked at the horrible destruction of the burrows.  I really wanted to see more Alan Rickman--you can never get enough of Alan Rickman.  I wished for more of Maggie Smith, but after realizing her battle with cancer during the filming, I give her props for her courage in going ahead.  Ms. Smith is a giant among actresses with a wonderful list of great films to her credit, but she will always be the one and only Professor McGonagall in my mind and no replacement would be possible.

My greatest beef was the anticlimactic ending--in the book, the fight going on with the death eaters and the Army of Dumbledore, along with death of Dumbledore was much more exciting and emotionally moving.  I sorely missed the grandeur of Dumbledore's funeral--which truly illustrated Dumbledore's greatness and how much he was loved by all creatures.  This was the biggest problem of all, along with the poor musical score (a sad rehashing of the last movie bits along with some forgettable fillers).  Please, oh please, pay John Williams anything he wants--beg him if you have to--to write the score for final two movies!

However, after my third time viewing the movie, I have to admit that the acting was better than ever, the dialogue was great, the chemistry between the actors has matured and solidified delightfully, the actor for Professor Slughorn was superior even to the character in the book, and Michael Gambon has finally filled the great shoes of Richard Harris.  The actors were the best part of the movie--perfect casting!

I give this movie three out of four stars after giving it a real chance and trying to overcome my personal objections to the huge changes from the book (which was simply amazing).  I'm sure in time many Potter fans who were disappointed with this chapter in the series will forgive these mistakes and accept it as it is--a valuable part of the Harry Potter series.",1260662400,2,2536,4.693002257336343

if someome didn't read the books and just saw the movies, he/she probably wouldn't have a problen with the film.  but if someone, like me, who did read the books, would.

it was lacking, done in a rush manner.  like the director took the book or script or whatnot, said, cut this, cut, cut with no thought about it. all done, I imagine, to save time and money which is sad and well stupid.  the movie should have been longer or done into two parts.  if it was done longer, granted, people would have complained about sitting on their butts for a 2 1/2 to 3 hour long movie but they would have done it.

the characters from Harry to hagrid were flat--they all seemed to have the look of boredom (or dissapointment) on their faces.  it was like, they came, mumbled their lines and went.  the only thing that was consistent was that it was dark, as it was in the book.

I thought the first movie was brilliant in every way. The second was very good. Beginning with Azkaban, the movies have gone downhill. I think Michael Gambon, while a fine actor, is horribly miscast as Dumbledore. Where's his twinkling eyes? Where's his mouth twiching when he's amused and trying not to show it? Albus Dumbledore, as we know him in the books, has an almost child-like sense of humor and wonder. Gambon lacks these qualities entirely. The dialogue is terrible. There's almost zero continuity in the film. I agree with Geoff . . this movie is only very loosely based on the book.

3041519,2,B000ZECQ08,"My son and I just re-watched Harry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince.  We had seen it in the theater over the summer and I had forgotten just how disappointing this movie was.  There were many, many important details that were left out from the book and an entirely new scene was inserted that made absolutely no sense.  This movie should've been split into two like Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows will be.  Since we are supposed to be getting clues as to Voldemort's past, the first and most important clue was left out of the movie!  The scene that is missing is how Tom Riddle Sr. met Voldemort's mother and how Voldemort ended up in the orphanage in the first place, and also how Voldemort came to be in the possession of the first horcrux.

The scene that really outraged me was the Christmas scene at the Weasley House.  If the writers of the script had been paying attention to ""A History of Hogwarts"" they would have known that the Weasley's house could not be destroyed like that because it is protected with charms just like Hogwarts is.  In addition, since the characters use the Weasley's house as a safe haven in both book 6 and 7, this scene is utterly ridiculous.  There is, however, a nice moment between Dumbledore and Harry in which Dumbledore realizes that Harry is actually the 8th Horcrux.

I also disliked how the director leached the color out of nearly every scene.  The Harry Potter movies have always been a visual feast, rich with color and detail, but as the story has grown darker, so have the movies - literally.  I miss the splendid colors of the first four movies.

I bought this movie in Blue Ray to complete our set, but it will probably be the Harry Potter movie I will be the least likely to re-watch.",1260576000,2,1742,4.509554140127388

In the Order of the Phoenix there are 2 scenes that epitomize what I am looking for in a movie and what the Half blood prince actually delivers.  In OotP the scene where Sirius dies was devastating, but then it would be very difficult to mess that up.  It is the emotion I am looking for not the exact words or scenes.  Instead this movie compares to the book as the OotP scene at the end where Harry was in Dumbledores office.  In the book it seemed to be the culmination of all the anger Harry had experienced and built up to.  Instead it was if they were reading the words off a page, hey maybe they were.  All the emotion had been stripped from the scene.  Comparably much of the emotion in the HPB have been changed or stripped when transfered to the movie.  I believe this has more to do the with the director than the actors.

Be it a wizard or muggle Voldemort has his sights set one finally completing his mission, but he must eliminate the chosen one. Harry Potter, is about to enter his sixth year at Hogwarts. This time, besides being closely watched over by the watchful and caring Albus Dumbledore Harry must face a new challenge, being a normal teenaged boy with his thoughts fixated on girls. Friendships and dating is swimming all throughout the corridors at Hogwarts and it's much more complicated than any Quidditch match. Still, Harry must stay focused because he can sense that there is a plot afoot to penetrate the walls of Hogwarts and turn the haven of wizarding youth into a spawning ground for Death Eaters. The questions that need to be answered are who is plotting it, whom are they after and who is working with them on the inside. There are many secrets revealed about Voldemorts past in this chapter, but most importantly this is the point in time when Harry Potter finally makes the choice on what he must do to finally take down his nemesis.

There were many mixed reviews about this film, but as a fan who read this book when it was first released this was my favorite installment (Meaning it surpases 'Chamber of Secrets'). What grabbed me the most was this book made things a little lighter after two extremely dark novels. It was a much more human story showing that while there is a classic story of good versus evil in an imaginative world these young witches and wizards are still just ordinary teenagers with ordinary problems. Bringing David Yates back to direct this film was the best choice because in 'Order Of The Phoenix' he brought realism to the characters and deep development within themselves and with one another. Tackling love and heartbreak is a very hard thing to do in a Sci-Fi fantasy film, but Yates nailed it. The story was also very funny as the book was. The characters show fears in the areas on popularity or just manning up to tell a girl how he felt. Tom Felton who has played Draco was finally given a chance to show his acting potential. While there was minimal dialogue until the very end his body language showed true emotional that really worked the crowd. The fact that a boy who has always boasted about being a proud dark wizard can shed tears when he faces his true self was made so believable by Felton. I sure hope that once these films have concluded he is given a chance for more work and many stellar performances.

 If you agree with this review then like me this will be a Harry Potter film you will enjoy. We now look forward to the final chapter going Hoarcrux on us to bring us the entire final book page by page. It looks as though they want to do the finale correctly so expect nothing less than a PG-13 rating.",1260576000,2,2913,4.523719165085389

Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince is a highly entertaining, fantasy adventure that also provides for some very witty humor.
Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Alan Rickman, and the rest of this EXTRAORDINARY cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!

Look at all the past HP movies, always a good blend of story with action. This movie was like a melodrama with minimal action. For 2 and1/2 hours that you expect some long exciting wizardry action you get a lot of dialog. It felt like there were not many action scenes. The only real exciting scenes were at the beginning where the villains known as the Dark Lords are flying around wrecking havoc and the ending with a death of a major character.
There wasn't even some giant monster or beast or any giants to fight...just some dead people coming out of the water entrapping Harry Potter and Dumbledorff.  It was decent, on - re-review, but it just lacked that spark this time around. I felt this lacked a lot of action that made the first ones great.. What gives ?
The only thing I can think of that this is the calm before the storm as obviously this set up the next 2 films which I hope will be full of action suspense, and other fantasy elements that make these films so good.
The story is to uncover the secrets of the Half Blood Prince, who is he, and to find the potion that uncovers the secrets of the prince. Lots of scenes of Harry's facial expressions. For a movie of this length there just was not enough scenes of action. Collectors will get the 2 disc version.",1260576000,,1437,4.361940298507463
3041525,4,B000ZECQ08,"I've read every Harry Potter book in the series, and watched every movie. I've loved every movie (except for PoA, as I can't stand the directing and editing). We pre-ordered the single disc DVD (widescreen) edition, and I'm very pleased with it. I received it on the day of release. Amazon, as usual, was flawless in delivery.

Now, to get on to the movie. As I said before, I loved all of the books, and have loved all of the movies except for #3 (see above). David Yates does a good job handling the wealth of information from the book, although they did take a very liberal license in omitting certain parts of the book (such as Dumbledore's funeral), or flat out changing some parts of the book (such as Luna finding a paralyzed Potter on the train, instead of Tonks). Despite these minor annoyances, the acting is really good from all the characters (especially Alan Rickman in his brilliant interpretation of Snape).

Overall, the movie was very well done. I'm really glad that David Yates has stuck with the franchise, as each movie has been better.

If you are a Potter fan, you will get this movie. If you are on the fence and want a good fantasy movie to watch, then I would recommend getting this as well.",1260576000,3,1216,4.5181818181818185

My biggest beefs with this film... They never explained why Snape is the HBP, those extra scenes, expecially the waitress chick (??!!), and they never told us what the other suspected Horcruxes were! (ie the memories Harry needs in order to find them in Deathly Hallows!) Are they planning to cram all that down our throat in the first 10 min of DH so that we have some clue? ARRGGHHH!
I don't expect it to follow the book completely, but really now, how about getting the important points across before adding all the extra drivel. If they could make HP3 and its complicated time travel plot make sense on film surely they could have made this one better!
The best part as always is ALan Rickman's Snape. God bless him for sticking this out. Hopefully they don't sideline him in DH.",1260489600,,1005,4.651685393258427
3041529,5,B000ZECQ08,"There are some spoilers in this review, so if you haven't watched the movie yet, I recommend that you don't read.

I've read quite a few of these other reviews, good and bad, and I agree with some of both. I think that YES they did leave a little too much IMPORTANT info out of this movie, while I also think they did a good job of getting more of the book into this one. There were VITAL scenes that they left out though, In the scene where Snape kills Dumbledore, he did make impossible for Harry to help him in the book, and I think that should have been kept in the movie. If they HAD to take it out, which I seriously doubt, why did they have to make it look like Harry didn't want to help? That made me mad. Also, one other part of the book that I considered VITAL to the movie was the funeral at the end. This was the most beautiful part of the entire book and it was also a little confirming. I say this because when I read the book, a little part of me kept thinking, ""Maybe Dumbledore's not dead"" and the funeral kinda gave me confirmation, and a beautiful closure.

This movie was rated 5 stars by me because I feel like it is a breath of fresh air compared to the last movie, which was my favorite book, and Phoenix was absolutely butchered. This one however kinda sets the pace a little better in preparing viewers for the last of the series and all the great things to come.

This movie really gives off that sense of urgency that you feel when reading the book when you consider how important it is for Harry to learn all that he can about Valdemort because he IS the ONLY one who can kill him. I just wish that they would have reminded you a little more in this movie WHY he needs to be killed.

But like I said, I did enjoy this one much more than the last, so I have to give it kudos. I read the book twice, and there were details in the movie that I had forgotten were in the book until I saw them on screen.

Five stars from me. Thanks.",1260489600,3,1956,4.043927648578811

The Bonus features on the discs makes this a 5-star product to me.  The movie is engaging, dark, and actually quite amusing.  A well balanced film, in my opinion.  My only gripe is that there are added scenes that weren't in the book (and really aren't necessary at all) while interesting book material was left out.  Still, if you haven't read any of the books but enjoy the movies then you won't have missed any really critical information.",1260403200,3,752,4.102739726027397
3041534,1,B000ZECQ08,"HBP was an inspired, almost impossible-to-put-down story. The movie rendition was not compelling, being completely disappointing as a book adaption.
I was appalled that the story was almost completely rewritten, that scenes were completely changed or missing altogether (thus affecting future story lines).  I am not complaining of the typical rewrites that are mandated through necessity, as translating a piece of literature onto film requires amendments. Instead, what I lament is the complete disregard for the story line altogether.
One of the many things that I admire about Rowling's writing is her ability to increase the level of tension and suspense throughout the book. This development of tension was blatantly missing from the movie. In the book the tension begins with the heightened security throughout the wizarding world, no student is left to wander alone and Harry is watched like a hawk. The presence of the Order of the Phoenix was vital to the literary version; however it is barely evident in the movie. In the movie Harry is allowed to wander at will and later he wanders with Ron and Hermione, no member of the Order hovering nearby for their protection.
Of course, the biggest disappointment, as others have mentioned, is the battle between Dumbledore's Army and the Deatheaters. In the book it was the crisis to which all actions were leading. In the movie, this event never occurs. Dumbledore's death wasn't even provided the emphasis it deserved and to rub it in, his funeral never transpires.
Perhaps the storyline was not paramount for the director of the movie, because those seemingly unimportant scenes that add depth and complexity to any story were also excluded. For example, the scenes that take place at The Burrow over Christmas, the interactions between the characters, would have added richness to the film that it lacked. What we get instead is the ninety-second version of the Christmas gathering, with none of the bickering or banter that occurs within families, like Fleur's imitation of Molly's favorite singer, or Ginny's mocking of Fleur behind her back. We really could have used those moments of levity.  I, of course, don't look forward to the wedding in the next film, as apparently Fleur and Bill are nonexistent. This is probably for the best as The Burrow was blown up in this film, an addition of which I can't see any value as it certainly didn't advance plot.
It was bad enough that the cast of characters that we've grown so fond of over the years are noticeably absent (most members of D.A. for starters); the ones we do see get very little screen time. The halls of Hogwarts are now filled with nameless crowd-fillers rather than characters we remember from previous films.  I also deplore that the actors and actresses that have helped to make these HP films so classically British are rarely seen in this film. Dame Maggie Smith and Robbie Coltrane were barely visible. We got to see Alan Rickman, but not enough, and Mark Williams and Julie Walters were not given sufficient time on screen. I was particularly horrified to see the scene when Ron was in the hospital wing after the accidental poisoning. In that scene there are several of Britain's finest living actors and actresses standing around for little apparent reason except to be upstaged, quite literally, by Jessie Cave playing the role of Lavender Brown. What a waste of great talent.
I could go on to make comments about the monochromatic and unchanging lighting to the ""Les Mis&eacute;rables"" look-alike stage settings, perhaps even making a few comments about the ""phoned-in"" performances by much of the cast, but I'll leave it here. Suffice it to say that I can't recommend this film if you're expecting to see a favorite book to come to life on the screen. If you like the Harry Potter series, don't buy the DVD. Save your money; go out and buy a good hard copy of the book and enjoy it as it was meant to be enjoyed; read it.",1260403200,9,3958,4.886904761904762

I understand cutting out things like the funeral.  This series is really going into a depressing area, and it really doesn't come out of it until the very end.  I think that JKR took a poor path when she darkened the story further than she really needed to.  But this movies bent even further in that direction with pretty much the entire production soaked in sepia toned depression, and the morose tone overshadowing the few remaining exciting parts.
I would not reccommend that anyone buy this movie.  Staring at a wall is less depressing.",1260403200,16,750,4.601503759398496
3041536,3,B000ZECQ08,"This review is difficult because the novel is my favorite in the series. To be fair to the movie producers, this novel is so rich in crucial info from the multiple story lines, it would be impossible to tell them all within the necessary time frame of a single motion picture... which makes it all the more incomprehensible that they would choose to ADD scenes not in the novel! Stupid decision! To leave out the change over of ministers... the relevance of Fenrir Greyback... the attack on Bill (Ron's older brother)... the act of Dumbledore immobilizing Harry, just prior to the end... no they just have Harry skulking underneath like a coward! I don't care that they had Albus tell Harry to do it. No HERO, and that is what Harry is, would just skulk below! These, all these events and more, are simply left out? And why have Greyback in there at all? Nowhere did they even mention his being a werewolf!!! and that he was the reason Remus was turned!!! --- This film is problematic in so many ways but to me, the biggest complaint I have is the almost total lack of COLOUR in the film!

3041538,5,B000ZECQ08,"I've given this product 5 stars for the entire package, and not the movie only.  As a movie, ""Half-Blood Prince"", is the best in the series since ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" and ""Goblet of Fire"".  Granted for the fans who have read the books as well, there are plenty of glaring omissions that take away from the story.  It's safe to say there will be a lot of making up to do in the ""Deathly Hallows"" films.

Still it is a great movie.  David Yates has done an excellent job of directing.  It is much better than his first installment in the series ""Order of ther Phoenix.""  My only quip with him as a director, is that he seems to shy away from the action scenes and go all out on the emotion and feeling.  Emotion is a key element of the series, but so is the action and thrill sequences.

The strongest element of Yates' direction is the acting.  ""Order of the Phoenix"" and ""Half-Blood Prince"" have arguably the best acting in the series, and it is a joy to watch in this film.

My final score for the movie itself is 4 out of 5 stars.

Now on to why the package gets 5 stars.  First of all it is a 3 disc package.  The Blu-Ray movie, the Blu-Ray Special Features disc, and the DVD movie.  So it has very high accesibility.  If you don't have a Blu-Ray at the current moment, you can still watch it on your DVD player while waiting to upgrade.  The Special Features disc, like with most of the Harry Potter DVDs, is PHENOMENAL!  The HP series always seems to hit grandslams with their special features.  One of the features included is a 2 minute preview of the ""Deathly Hallows.""

Finally there is an option for a Digital Copy.  With all of this, it makes ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" one of the best Blu-Ray/DVD packages around.",1260403200,7,1740,4.308641975308642

Once I read them (they were EXCELLENT by the way) I started to understand what others were talking about.

There's not much here to justify that claim and quite a lot that simply does not belong.

Some changes were just stupid, not paralyzing Harry during the climatic scene, for example.  Some make a certain kind of sense, not having the Hogwarts battle in this movie, saving it for the great finale in the last book (movie) and perhaps that is why they added the Burrows fight.  I didn't really mind the Burrows fight for that reason, since it was consistent with the tone of the book, but allowed the BIG Hogwart's fight that is coming to (perhaps) have more of an impact.

Others have detailed the other horrid omissions, so I won't recap them all here.  One that REALLY bugged me was not having the Snape, ""DON'T CALL ME A COWARD!"" Harry scene.

They should have also explained the constant dreary foggy look of the movie, at least a throw away comment from a muggle, or about muggles not understanding the weather.  Hogwarts has always been able to control it's internal weather though, and a few sharp, clearly photographed, colorful scenes would have been a RELIEF to see once or twice during this visually dull movie.

By the time I was ten minutes into the movie I was so distracted by the off-colors, kind of like a very bad ""colorized"" black and white movie, that the plot points escaped me. I really had to concentrate on the story, sometimes looking at the floor so that the muddy picture wouldn't distract me, but finally gave up after an hour.

Maybe it redeemed itself in the last hour and a half, but I doubt it.

I had to add that my wife, who dearly loves the Harry Potter books, and owns both the VHS and DVD copies of the first three films, can't stand watching this either. She now plays it only when she is in bed, back turned towards the TV as she is falling asleep.

Update...02/16/2012

I pre-ordered the complete Harry Potter set on Blu-ray discs (11 discs and the entire 8 movie collection) from AmazonUK in September of  2011 for a delivered price of $46.00 in mid-November of 2011 (30 British Pounds).

Like many of the other reviewers, I was sorely let down by the fight at Hogwarts and the death of Dumbledore. First, how could they have cut out Harry being paralyzed by a spell from Dumbledore to immobilize him from trying to save him?  If Harry wasn't paralyzed into inaction he would have fought to his death to save Dumbledore. That is who Harry is, not some sniveling weakling fretting over the obvious demise of his hero and mentor.  He NEVER would have just stood there, NEVER!

What about the battle that took place between those living at Hogwarts, the auror's, and the death eaters?  That was a pivitol and extremely important part of the book, a defining moment, and they just chopped it right out!  UGH!

How in the name of all that is holy could they even think of cutting out Dumbledore's funeral? What were they thinking?  Here is one of the MOST IMPORTANT characters of the whole series, dead, and they spend no time on it at all!  How could they cut that?! Inconceivable! I truly resent it actually. Talk about ruining it. I swear if they add the funeral at the beginning of movie 7, which results in taking up precious filming time(because it should have been in film 6, not Harry trying to pick up some chick and various other stupid add ins),my head will spin around!

Dear director, could you please NOT ruin film 7 by adding your stupid and pointless point of views? Just stick to the book, give us the funeral IF you still intend to stick to all of the important parts of book 7, tell us the story as Rowling intended(her way is brilliant) or I will write you a real letter cursing your career! We, as fans, have been waiting a long time for the conclusion of this story, please care enough about us to give us the story as Rowling intended it! There is absolutely no need to change or add anything!

What about the love story between Harry and Ginny? How could they change that? It was incredible in the book and so sweet. By the time they got together in the book you were soooo ready for it. Thanks movie, for ruining that too. UGH!
How could you leave out Dobby and Kreacher who have major parts in book 7? Huge disappointment.

Let's pray they do justice to book 7 in the movie adaptation. I truly want it to be epic!  It deserves to be; for us the fans, for J.K. Rowling(whom I hoped complained alot about movie 6), for Daniel Radcliffe and the other actors whom have given their young lives to this project, and for the amazing story itself. Please director do not blow it!

3041547,3,B000ZECQ08,"Somehow the plot seems to have been overlooked in this movie. The book was fantastic but the movie is pretty dull.  I can't imagine why the screenwriter felt so much of the book needed to be changed.  After all, we fans have bought the series because of the story.  Why change it?  And time constraints won't work as an excuse.

 The opening was just ridiculous as was the burning of the Burrow.  Neither lent anything to the story; they were just there.  There is no reason why Dumbledore could not have picked up Harry at the Dursleys.  There was no point to those two incidents.

 A great part of the story is the interplay between the main characters.  This has been botched in this movie.  With every successive book the bond grows tighter between the 3.  Now Ron and Hermione been relegated to a back seat and Harry is kind of listless. Hermione was a smart and strong female figure, now she's a shadow of herself. The books show Ginny as another smart,strong, funny female character akin to Hermione.  Where is this Ginny in the movies? In my opinion the stand out characters in the movie were the always wonderful Alan Rickman and Jim Broadbent. They are consistently believable which brings me to the unhappy characterization of Dumbledore.  I can never reconcile the Dumbledore in the movies (excepting Richards Harris' portrayal) with the Dumbledore in the books.

 Are the director and screen writer so full of themselves that they think these changes are better then the stories we so avidly read?  Seems to me there is a lot of conceit here.

 The musical score is non remarkable and basically adds nothing.

 This is the 1st movie I'm not buying.  The 1st and 2nd movies hit it all right. Movies 3 & 4 were tolerable and then the real downhill slide began. I think the problem is those involved in the movie can't decide what audience they want to cater to; should this be a kids movie or an adult movie?  It ends up being neither.

 Perhaps Harry Potter is not a great piece of literature to those involved in the production of these movies.  However, as a comparison of fantasy, Mr. Jackson treated the Lord of the Rings trilogy with respect and each movie was a gem.

 As I watched the last movie I though of how great it could have been and frankly I'm saddened.  Perhaps those involved in the movies are just over the whole thing.",1260316800,2,2350,4.55023923444976

As such, this movie was a total disappointment: a completely disjointed story, (as someone else here said, if you have not read the books you could not possibly have a clue about what is going on), pathetic acting, with all except for the most experienced actors such as Maggie Smith, Emma Watson and Snape behaving as if they were reading their lines for the first time, at rehearsal, from the script. No emotions, no passion, no excitement, no suspense. Just a series of separate, dispassionate scenes lined up, one after the other. I blame the director and the script writer, not the actors, as all of them are experienced and could not possibly have acted this way except if told to - as my director-to-be daughter put it, they all seem utterly ""over-directed"". And why in the world include scenes that are not even there in the book and do not belong for a second? If the Burrow is burned down, where will they keep the wedding for Bill and Fleur later? My conclusion is that the director already knew that the one and only strength of this poor rendition of the Half Blood Prince would be its special effects - which are good, but cannot make up for the other shortcomings - and therefore added another scene with nothing but special effects, at the cost of the plot. I have seen all the movies, really like no 1 and 2, but I cannot stand this director and how he murders these stories - this one was by far the worst. At my daughter's request I still bought the movie, just to have a complete set, but I 1000 times prefer the book!!",1260316800,4,1610,4.37

Three-quarters of the way through this DVD, I got distracted and started balancing my checkbook.  That mundane task was more captivating than the movie.  I guess my attention wandered in part because the movie seems to take itself very seriously, without giving me a reason to join in that sentiment.  After a while, all the cgi storm clouds and magic mumbo jumbo just began to blend together into a big pile of ""I can't relate to this and I don't much care.""  All the charm, wit, and inventiveness of the early films seems to have been lost, and now the focus is just on the struggle with Voldemort, which is really not very engaging.  In the early films, it just gave the characters something to do while we got to know them and their world.  Now it's nearly all there is.  At least this DVD had some love story to provide human interest, so that was a bright spot.

3041554,4,B000ZECQ08,"This entry in the series literally picks up at the end of the last.  The wizarding world has finally admitted what Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) have been saying for a year - Lord Voldemort is back.  And that leads everyone into a panic.  Ron (Rupert Grint), Hermione (Emma Watson), and Ginny (Bonnie Wright) are barely allowed to go back to Hogwarts by their worried parents, for example.

But back they and everyone else go.  Harry is captain of the Quidditch team this year.  Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) has started teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts, making way for Professor Slughorn (Jim Broadbent) to regain his long ago post of Potions.  And love is in the air as all our main characters seem to struggle with their feelings for the opposite sex.

Below the surface, trouble is still brewing.  Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) has been given a secret mission by Voldemort.  And Dumbledore has some memories and a mission of his own for Harry.  Will these missions mean that good can triumph over evil?

Let's start by being honest.  Odds are if you aren't familiar with the characters, you probably won't get what's happening here.  There are just too many of them and they are introduced too quickly with little to no explanation or back story.  If you have seen the previous movies, you should be fine.  But don't even think about making this your introduction to the Harry Potter world.

The other word of warning is to not go into the movie expecting the book.  You will probably be most disappointed by that here.  Instead of giving us lots of backstory on tom Riddle/Lord Voldemort, the film focuses more on the romantic stories.  I've got to admit, I enjoyed that.  I don't think I have ever laughed so hard at a Harry Potter film.  Plus we really get the return of Quidditch, which also provided some laughs.

However, this emphasis cut down on the amount of time we could focus on the story.  And this story really sets things up for the final book (or final two movies).  I think enough of the pieces were presented that you can just watch the movies and understand what is to come.  But one plot point I thought was important did get dropped.  I guess we'll see how they proceed from here.

I found the PG rating surprising at first, but I think it works.  Even with the romance playing such a key part of the movie, it is still more innocent in tone than the previous two movies.  That's not to say that the climax isn't dark, but it also isn't long and drawn out, which really improves the pacing.  It does leave one character's actions in doubt, but it's a minor point over all.

Frankly, none of the movies have been completely faithful to the books, but this one seems the worst of the lot.  If you haven't read the books, you won't notice the difference.  And if you have, try to let that go and just enjoy what is here.",1260230400,2,2879,4.536964980544747

It is a combo pack that includes a Blu-Ray movie, a DVD movie, and a Digital Copy.  I like that the pack comes in all the flavors of video, and thank goodness:  We only have one blu-ray player and HDTV (in the living room), my wife and daughter watch their movies in SD (DVD) in the bedroom, and I watch on the computer.  I also enjoyed some of the extras that came with this set.  I liked the additional scenes, and the lightning-round Q&A with the cast and crew.  There are also exclusive features for blu-ray viewers, if you have a BD-live enabled player.  I am also looking forward to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Orlando (sneak peek in this set).

""A boy who grew up in a cupboard, not knowing he is a wizard, destined to fight the most evil wizard of all time.""

Having not seen the movie when it came out in the theaters, I was pleasantly surprised with how the movie was put together.  The characters are all coming of age, and henceforth so must the plot.  The movie starts with Harry getting a date with a muggle waitress, while the rest of the characters similarly suffer teenage hormonal rage and sexual tension.  Oh, and they also do magic, battle bad wizards, and plot a way to destroy the evil Lord Voldemort.  If you expect it to be just like the book, be prepared for the disappointment.  However, if you keep an open mind and understand the director's/writer's prerogative, then the movie will surely be a pleasure to watch.  It is a great feel-good movie, but you sort of have to know the entire saga to understand this.  One can see that as the series progressed, so did the dark theme.  This movie is quite gothic, and drips of doom.

My disappointment is in the lag time between the books and the movies.  This movie has drained much of the urgency from the screen adaptation, which seemed to have come across as an afterthought, significantly more so than the previous films.  This is the source of the missing star on the rating.

For the time being, I will not review the movie plot since there are tons of movie reviews for HP 6 and the Half Blood Prince.

A strong 4 out of 5 stars (not fully earning the 5 star rating).",1260144000,3,2491,4.880952380952381
3041558,3,B000ZECQ08,"There was alot to shove into this HBP movie, as with all of the movies, to do some sort of justice to the books. Saw the movie and  I have pre-ordered it to add to my collection, but there isn't as much anticipation with this one. There was plenty to like about this movie,I guess there were pivotal moments in the HBP book that I assumed would have made it into the movie, but didn't. Also there were add ons that didn't quite fit.

Like the prior post, Dumbledore with the Dursleys was absent,and instead it shows Harry in the beginning planning a hook up with a muggle waitress? It would have been enjoyable to see Dumbledore and Vernon Dursley sqare off in Muggleland on the big screen. Then there is Hermoine having a yelling spat with Lavender Brown over an inert Ron Weasley in the sick ward. Again in contrast with the book.  I did not get any romantic connection between Harry and Ginny at all, probably due to the waitress at the beginning of the book, it seems to have dampered that possibility, and made it seem like they were just getting jumbled in together instead of showing a more believable connection. The burning of the Burrow made no sense, and they could have used that waste of time to dedicate to Dumbledore at the end of the movie and try to show a better effort of keeping to the book on that level. It would be in Warner Bros best interest to not switch around the release dates for the last 2 movies like they did to the HBP, due to the fact that the hpye was not justified, and this movie had too many add ons that clashed too much with the book.",1260057600,,1575,4.296296296296297

In the movie he is not even immobilized and he just stands there and does nothing! The Harry Potter I know would in no way have just stood there and let Dumbledore be slaughtered. He would have tried to come out of his hiding place, screamed, tried anything to save him! The entire ending of the book was simply left out, too,as Dumbledore's death is just sort of glossed over. And where were all the questions in Harry's mind as to how Dumbledore could not know that Snape was on Voldemort's side? These questions Harry asks himself are extremely important to what is to come. Finally, is this a Harry Potter story or just a love story? I think the makers of this film wanted to appeal to the teenagers in the audience rather than make a faithful adaptation.

I was incredibly disappointed when i saw Order of the Phoenix. Its my favorite book of the series and they completely butchered it on film. I went to see Half Blood Prince thinking that it was going to be a different experience..and I was right.. it was WORSE! They concentrated too much on things that weren't important to the story (romances are you serious?) and cut scenes that SHOULD have been included (battle in hogwarts). The most disappointment though.. was the ending. Dumbledore death...well.. it wasn't as sad as it was in the book. It was very emotionless to me. What was up with that?

It had some good. The visual affects were amazing... and the acting improved quite a bit. Tom Felton did an incredible job as Draco Molfoy. Kuddos to him!!

3041561,2,B000ZECQ08,"When a movie of a book is made it's understandable that not everything in a 400+ page book is going to end up on the screen. However, I can see no reason why the film can't contain most of the key story elements. The first two films, directed by Chris Columbus, did very well at this. However, subsequent films tended to veer away from Rowling's genius-level storytelling in order to emphasize pet interests of the producers/screenwriters/directors. Whoever was responsible for these messes has a lot to apologize for. Obviously, they are going after market, changing the stories to suit what they perceive as the prime audience for their films, and presumably they conceive of this audience as largely never having read the books. All sorts of extraneous material is introduced and key Rowling settings and subplots are left out. And it's not just a matter of what's left out but of focus. Key gut-wrenching climaxes in the books are breezed by in the film, in order, I suppose, to pack in more teenage angst. Anyone with even a modicum understanding of storytelling ought to be able to come up with a screenplay that preserves the focus of Rowling's storytelling, particularly the breathtaking drive toward the final climax, which is a keynote of her stories and among the best in the biz. It astonishes me that this should be completely ignored by the makers of the Harry Potter films. I am tempted to attribute this to an intentional effort to drive more profit out of the various properties, but a niggling suspicion lingers that they are just inept and clueless, yes, and rather egotistical to imagine they can better stories, which emerge from Rowling's pen, compelling, dynamic, and in every way worthy of the worldwide phenomenon they have created.",1259971200,5,1757,4.899328859060403

3041564,3,B000ZECQ08,"Warner Brothers latched on to a cash cow with the Harry Potter films.  Based on the incredibly popular books by J.K. Rowling, the series has followed the exploits of young Harry from his freshman year at Hogwarts Wizards School through his maturation into both young man and wizard, wary of his powers.  The film series has kept the same three principal actors throughout the series; they have literally grown up before our eyes.  ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" is the latest installment.

We first see Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) in a subway eatery, perusing a newspaper that questions whether Harry Potter is the Chosen One.  Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) mysteriously appears to enlist Harry's assistance in convincing reclusive Prof. Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent), once a teacher at Hogwarts, to return.  His memories about a former student, Tom Riddle -- who grew up to become the dreaded Voldemort -- are needed to help determine how to defend against and banish the evil entity once and for all.

The film spends a lot of time on flirtations between Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) and Harry and Ron's sister, Ginny (Bonnie Wright).  Lavender Brown (Jessie Cave), fellow Hogwarts student, also has eyes for Ron.  These tepid romances don't really go anywhere and are tossed in out of deference to the novel and the fact that the Hogwarts trio are beginning to look pretty old not to have an interest in romance, however chaste.

As with the previous Potter films, this one is visually stunning, even though director David Yates has gone for a more somber palette.  With its combination of spectacular vistas and dazzling CGI work, ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" is one of most beautiful-looking films of the year.  Though we've seen  Quidditch matches before, the one in the current film far surpasses them in terms of energy, excitement, humor, and sheer visual splendor.  It's one of the film's highlights in terms of pure exhilaration.

Mr. Radcliffe, who's spent half his life playing Harry Potter, is OK but doesn't have a heck of a lot of razzle dazzle this time around.  He's not as much fun to watch as in earlier installments.  This may have to do with the movie's darker nature, but the script does have opportunities for lighter moments that never materialize.

I was disappointed that Hermione has been relegated practically to an extra.  She interacts very little with either Harry or Ron, and plays her romantic scenes awkwardly and unconvincingly.  Mr. Grint fares better with screen time, but Ron is never involved fully in the adventure at hand.  He's there for scenes in which Ron and Harry talk about their respective infatuations, but contributes little more.  The romantic -- if you can call them that -- interludes become tedious and slow the action considerably.

Mr. Broadbent is a welcome addition to the new film.  This is an actor who effortlessly conveys the essence of whatever character he's portraying.  His Prof. Slughorn is intelligent, absentminded, guarded, mysterious, troubled, and fearful, as required.  It's fortunate that Broadbent is portraying a major character, since he commands our attention whenever he's on screen.

Many characters from the earlier films chime in with a few bits of dialogue here and there but are otherwise unnecessary to plot.  Prof. McGonagall (Maggie Smith) shows up halfway through as the voice of caution when Harry becomes increasingly involved in elaborate intrigues.  Prof. Severus Snape (Alan Rickman), filmed mostly in close-up, delivers his menacing lines with dramatic pauses you could drive a train through.  Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) pops up, only to fall asleep for most of his screen time, and Prof. Flitwick (Warwick Davis) ambles about more as set dressing than plot ingredient.

Tom Felton's Draco Malfoy has a larger role than in previous Potter films and is seen lurking in dark corners, traveling to cryptic locations, and secretly plotting.  Mr. Felton has the knack for looking evil at all times, playing his role with little dialogue and a disturbing sneer.  The actor who really makes a commanding impression is Frank Dillane as 16-year-old Tom Riddle.  Shot mostly in close-up, Mr. Dillane conveys a maturity and intelligence mixed with malevolence that comes through perfectly.  He appears in only one scene, but he's one of the best things in ""Half-Blood Prince.""

The major problem with ""Half-Blood Price"" is that it's a transitional film, promising but not yet delivering the good stuff.  It is often ponderously talky in an attempt to keep the viewer up to speed, but memories are short.  The script assumes an awful lot of knowledge on the part of the viewer, and only a devoted reader of the books will easily recognizes nuances and foreshadowings.  I was reminded of ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and how disappointed viewers were at the inconclusiveness of that ""Star Wars"" installment.  The same holds true for ""Half-Blood Prince.""  The final scene is really a setup -- even a commercial -- for the upcoming two-part finale, ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,"" to be released in 2010 and 2011.  Don't expect all plot points to be tied with a neat bow.

""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince""  is far too long at two and a half hours plus.  Though it is always visually remarkable, it will likely confuse those who don't know Potter lore, chapter and verse.  For Potter fans, it will be a delight, as they will fill in the blanks left by the screenplay.",1259366400,3,5501,5.015435501653804

3041566,4,B000ZECQ08,"i completely and inequivocally agree with  z hayes (plano,texas)  on every aspect that she touched on.  Book 6 in the Harry Potter series was my absolute favorite and the movie just did not do it justice.  it was a decent movie if you've seen all the movies but never read the books however, if you've read the books it would be hard, if not impossible, to give this movie 5 stars.  really, im stretching it to give it four.  the added scenes add nothing to the movie and most of the scenes from the book that weren't in the movie were vitally important to the plot and progression of the characters and story.  im not going to give anything away, i just need to say that the movie was a disappointment.  the characters are amazing in that the actors portraying them portray them perfectly and with the necessary depth.  my only hope for the final 2 movies is that the directly sticks to the book and doesn't go on about adding more unnecessary and meaningless scenes.  given that the final book is in two installments there is no reason not to lay it all out there and just really go for it.  more action, more depth, more special effects, more everything.  for those of us that have been following the series through 7 books and 6 movies i think it is vitally important to give us what we've been waiting for.  if i may say so, we aren't looking for the directors interpretation of what the book should have been, we are looking for exactly what the book was laid out on screen in all its glory from start to finish.  for me, the whole point of the movie adaptations lays in the success of this last one and by success i mean accuracy, depth, and wow factor.  i want to leave the theater feeling like it was all worth it and in this one i really just didn't and that's not even including the disappointment and irritation that stemmed from the fact that my favorite book was a let down on screen.",1259280000,5,1898,4.337110481586402

What I'd like to point out to all the detractors out there about book to film adaptations, is that you really need to quit complaining that films don't match up to the books, ANY BOOK.

There is no way anybook can be made into a film word for word or plot point to plot point. Movies would be over six hours long. You need to appreciate films for themselves. You will always find something wrong with any film if you look for it.

The fact is you need to be able to sit back relax and let the ""film"" not the ""book"" entertain you. Also most films based in metaphysics or science fiction need you to leave logic and embrace the the notion of suspending belief at the door. So please just take the time to enjoy the films you watch for what they are 90 to 150 mins of escapism, a place to leave the worries and stresses of everyday life and relax to a good story.",1259280000,6,967,4.078947368421052

I was also disappointed when they didn't have Dumbledore's funeral. They pretty much just let him lay dead on the pavement. I thought the cave was exciting and i was really happy that it turned out the way it did in my head when i read the book. I thought it was a bit dark and different for the Harry Potter series.

3041573,5,B000ZECQ08,"Wow, I laugh at the people who rate movies poorly based on what they read in a book. Books don't normally make for a very good film in the first place. The best thing I feel to do is to separate the two ideas of film vs. book. Two different thing and therefore must be viewed in two different ways. It's like comparing apples/oranges, Tupperware/tool boxes, Ford Temp/private jets etc.

I watched this one before I saw the others so I went back and watched 1 all the way up to this (I finally understand it). In comparison to the first 3 the films do get better as they progress; less character development and more of the good stuff. If you're wondering, I'm not much into reading fantasy books. I'd much rather read a physics text, engineering text, or even a dictionary (something educational). I get my fantasy time from watching movies.

After sneeking a view of snippets of this movie online and how ""reserved?"" ""lackluster?"" the emotional content displayed in two of the crescendo parts e.g. Snape's ""mercy"" killing of Dumbledore and the ultrication between Snape and Harry makes me hesitate to order this DVD. I think now I will wait and purchase it second hand and help someone else defray the ""disappointment factor"" cost of this travesy of a movie. The only thing movie producers pay attention to is money. There is a way to get your point across. Borrow it from the library.

Addendum to this review after borrowing the library copy;
OK, giggle..... I watched a library copy of this movie with my husband who was more entertained watching me watch the movie rather than the movie. He is well read and has belonged to literary clubs thoughout his parochial and college level schooling. That being said, the story line was so scattered he could not follow it and began asking logical questions. I spent nearly the entire movie as a ""voice over"" helping him pick up the pieces to where the plot was going (well, supposed to go) and he needed assistance to pay attention to small clues that should have been prominent. (Like Dumbledore's injured hand) that appeared to anyone who had not read the book or listened to the library audio book enroute to work as I did, rather normal looking.
I was at a total loss as to why wasted movie footage showing the Burrows being burned. As if we needed to be shown that Death eaters were really ""bad"" guys. And what is with the scene of Hermione's date thowing up a mouthful of Dragon balls in front of Snape? Did Snape smell alcohol on his breath to warrant a month's detention? I must have missed something here. The emotional climax of the entire book when Harry finds out the true identity of the ""Half Blood Prince""  was such a let-down. In the book, Harry was supposed to be horror stricken and in his ""out of mind"" emotional agony of loss and betrayal, beg Snape for death as a release from it. When that does not work, Harry attempts to taunt Snape into such an frenzied anger he kills him. In this movie, Snape announces he is the Half Blood Prince almost as if he is grudgingly administering another school detention and walks off screen..........""What was that?""  No funeral or noticable tears for Dumbledore. The wands raised aloft prompted my husband to jokingly ask me where the Bic lighters were to flick on for better light at this lame concert.
The movie was far worse than I originally suspected.  I do not know who is most at fault, the screen writer Steve Kloves or director David Yates. I do not hold up hope or interest for the last two installments. This movie series has become progressively worse with each addition. Chris Columbus directing the first two years and Alfonso Curaon with the third movie are far superior in content and story line.  Like I mentioned in the beginning. Do not waste your money on this purchase. Your most enjoyable time will be to buy the audio book and listen to Jim Dale's voice. The movie created in your head while you do something useful like drive or do dishes will be much better. The vocal renditions of nearly all charaters by Jim Dale are far better than this movie. Wonderful voices.. Creature's voice always gets me laughing out loud.......and ""Oh Gawd,"" if Jim Dale could only mimic the deeply sensual, velvety vocal tones of Alan Rickman's Snape then there would be no need to suffer through the bad movie.",1258502400,12,3497,4.632258064516129
3041577,2,B000ZECQ08,"Harry Potter the books I have yet to read... But Harry Potter the movies I have seen and own all so far. I loved most of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire better then most of the other films (what with all the dragons and mermaids! And this was even before I read or saw Twilight and knew of Robert Pattinson - don't judge me, I'm weak and a ""sucker"" for a good vampire romance) And, although (according to my mom who has read all the books) there is apparently so much more then the films can show - I still liked all the films... That is until I saw The Half Blood Prince. It felt short and left me very much confused... To me it should have been either a double feature with the next film or like what they did in Underworld Evolution where you have a bit of a ""prequel"" feeling and then it goes into the next part of the story. I will buy The Half Blood Prince (probably not right away... wait for it to come down in price) as I am a bit of a collector and need to have all of a series, but I don't foresee watching this chapter very often.

Plus Lupin never married Tonks in this book. Didn't live up to the book at all so it only gets 3 stars from me. I only hope they end the last movie how it's supposed to be done.",1258156800,12,507,4.404255319148936
3041579,4,B000ZECQ08,"First off, I gave it 4 stars because compared to the other movies, it was closest to the book, even if they did do some stupid changes to it. Plus, I love Harry Potter, and am a HUGE fan of all books and movies. However, the reasons below are why it did not get 5 stars.

ATTENTION!!! SPOILERS AHEAD!!!

I have to agree, that there were many things about this movie that was really, really disappointing. The scenes left out, most disappointing, can we get a movie that at least sticks to the books entirely? The scenes added...burning the Burrow down, honestly, what the hell was the person who thought that up smoking? It leaves so many open questions as to how well they are going to do the next two movies.

The pensive/Dumbledore's lessons were not given enough time. In the seventh book, the pensive plays an important role in how Harry comes to realize Severus Snape was really on his side, and truly had cared for his mother, which plays a role in the final fight against Voldemort. Not to mention, showing Harry the reasons why Dumbledore did what he did.

Burning down of the Burrow means that they are either NOT going to show the scene where they get Harry from the Dursley's to the Burrow, or they are going to change it. Plus, they will either change or leave out the wedding, which means they will need to change how they show that the ministry has fallen. In turn, that means changing most of the facts from the movie, including how the death eaters catch Harry, Ron and Hermione, since saying ""Lord Voldemort"" made the enchantments break due to the death eaters in the ministry making it so. Not to mention Rufus Scrimgeour (minister of magic) dying and to Harry's surprise, protecting him and not revealing his whereabouts. How in the world are they going to have anything at the Burrow with it burnt down? And if they are going to have the Burrow in the next movie, it means an unnecessary scene of explaining how the damn thing is still there, which they will HAVE to do since putting that scene in. It was entirely unnecessary to have the Burrow burn down, even if they did have the death eaters show up there.... Oh, and at the wedding is when we are first introduced to the deathly hallows, the sign on Xenophilius Lovegood's robes, and Viktor Krum introducing the first of the backround that they find out about it. It does play a role as well in their 'quest' in the 7th movie.

Okay, enough on that scene, what about adding the beginning in like that...he was supposed to be waiting for Professor Dumbledore at the Dursleys..Dumbledore had much, and I mean much to say to the Dursleys, including reprimanding them for not treating Harry as he had asked them to. Plus, he tells Harry of him owning Grimwald place and Kreacher. Hmm, doesn't a big chunk of the 7th book take place at Grimwald palace..I see more unnecessary scenes added in the 7th movie.

Scrimgeour not in the movie at all..not even mentioned...what about when they give Harry, Hermione and Ron the inheritance??? Are they really adding a scene to explain who he freaking is??? Seems like they will be adding a lot more to the 7th to explain things they messed up in the first 6. (Meeting of the muggle minister isn't as important, but I would have liked to see it closer to the books. For some reason, when they make movies, they think completely changing it will make it better, and it never is...when will they learn...)

""Tonks rescuing Harry from the train? Nope, now it's Luna, looking for Wrackspurts, and removing Harry's invisibility cloak with her wand. (As A Deathly Hallow, it should be immune to summoning and/or levitation charms.)"" I quote this because I totally agree, again, mistakes made that true fans are noticing, and it does nothing but discredit the makers of the movies as being egotistical and arrogant enough to think we would like their version so much better when it leaves so many holes.....

Harry and Ginny's first kiss was pathetic and should have been done the way the book shows since Ginny IS Ron's sister, and the consent from Ron, being Harry's best friend, was important. Plus, they left out Harry breaking up with Ginny at the end and that was definitely important. Again, egotistical directors, screen writers, etc...

The Gaunt house memories and Voldemort's reason for the locket becoming a Horcrux are gone....as well as the memories of Helga Hufflepuff's cup and Voldemort asking Dumbledore for a teaching position....

Snape's ""Defense Against the Dark Arts"" lessons...ummm hasn't it been a point in all the other movies that he's wanted this position, and then they don't show it when he has it...IDIOTS!!!

Harry finds Mundungus Fletcher stealing property from grimwald place, and it's important for the next movie because he steals the locket. And they must track it down, which leads us back to Umbridge having Moody's eye on her door and the locket. She also attends Dumbledore's funeral, which they left out. Which would have included Scrimgeor talking to Harry about him helping the ministry. Which they didn't show at all in the movie, and which is very, very important!

Harry finding out that Snape was the one that betrayed his parents to Voldemort by telling him the prophecy was extremely huge... and they don't mention it. In fact, Snape's role is very, very small compared to what his role in the book was. He should have had a little more limelight as trying to help Draco, and Harry and Snape issues and finally Dumbledore and Snape's plans and issues...nothing....

Harry being stupified by Dumbledore in the end to protect him was key as 1)that's why he was disarmed and 2)come on, Harry just sit by and watch them kill Dumbledore...that wasn't believable at all....

The death eaters fighting those at Hogwarts...not one scene....

THEY TOOK OUT DUMBLEDORE'S FUNERAL!!! SERIOUSLY?????

HOWEVER!! As far as comparing to the other movies, it is closest to the book, I must say than the others, just wish some KEY things would not have been skipped or changed.",1258070400,4,6013,4.717826501429934

- the revelation of Snape as the Half Blood Prince
- Dumbledore's death
- Dumbledore's funeral
- the battle scene after the funeral

Ah well. We have Deathly Hallows to look forward to, and though I'm further disappointed that they chose to do it in two films rather than a longer one with an intermission (they used to do that, you know, when attention spans were longer), one can only hope they'll treat the final installment with a little more respect.",1257984000,6,750,4.555555555555555

I hadn't really thought of all the parts they'd taken out, I will say that for every scene they took out, there's another in that _was_ in the book. So in my mind, they couldn't have it all, and it came down to weighing which ones to keep in.

With regards to the two scenes that are causing the most controversy, the burning of the barrows and the waitress scenes, I'm willing to look past. It's a movie, and it's playing towards a movie audience, whether they read the book or not, and these two scenes are overly dramatic/cute as such.

For me, a Harry Potter fan who has only gone through the book(s) once, it was a fun experience. I will say Lavender made me cringe a few times, but I feel like that was the point!

They're splitting the last book into two movies, which really it could fill up by itself easily, but here's hoping they catch us up on some stuff from the last book while they're at it.

David Yates has managed to take a crop of excellent and experienced actors and actresses, a wonderful book, and an inexhaustible budget and come up with a dark (muted colours and dim lighting making it literally dark, not metaphorically dark), confusing and lifeless movie that is frankly boring.  Those who have not read the books will find it very difficult to follow the story in this movie - it leaps inexplicably from setting to setting with no apparent reason.  Those who are familiar with the book will wonder why so much has been missed out, and why Yates has chosen to add to the story with inexplicable and irrelevant new scenes.

The dialogue has a few good moments - in particular the way that the boyfriend/girlfriend scenes are managed and the few appearances made by Luna Lovegood, but on the whole is lifeless and drab.  The irrepressibly awful Helena Bonham Carter dominates all the scenes she is in and is a major distraction.

 Learn like other people have said that movies cannot always be a faithful adaptation of a book.  Dont not judge this movie based on the others but what it was made for and probably how JK Rowling wrote the book for.  The movie and book are made to set the scene for what is to come the final battle.  Yes some things are left out but I feel if people read the books instead of just watching the movies then they will know these things that do not need to be spelled out in every movie.

3041586,1,B000ZECQ08,"Where to begin, where to begin? Well, I guess I'll tell you that there will be spoilers in this review and that this is coming from someone who has read this book over 5 times. Well, I guess I'll start with my reasons for hating this abomination. Nothing in this movie matches up to the book except for SOME of the most basic parts of the plot. They couldn't even put in some of the basic parts of the plot to this movie. I didn't expect an exact replica on the big screen, and I did tone down my expectations after the mess that was Phoenix. However, I did expect to see a Harry Potter movie. Not a teen romance with Malfoy randomly throwing a bird into his magic closet at random intervals. The character's had no emotion whatsoever. In the book, the students and staff are beside themselves crying because of Dumbledore dying. In the movie, they all look at his body with a straight face and shoot some magic light in the air.

If I remember correctly, the book had something at the end... hm... I remember it was the most exciting part... maybe, a fight? Yeah, there was a gigantic battle right after Dumbledore died, as I recall. What I DON'T recall is the deatheaters blowing up the school right underneath the bedrooms and classes, and just calmly walking out the door. I also remember a funeral scene vaguely, where the entire plot was set up for the next book including a wedding. Oh, wait one minute! I forgot. In the movies Fenrir Greyback is a human, Ron's brother Bill doesn't exist to be turned into a werewolf or get married, and the Weasly's home BURNED DOWN. Basically, they have destroyed the end of the movie to the point that the next movie is un-doable.

The entire movie is a crappy teen romantic comedy set in the wizard world. I remember that there was some romance in the book, there was the half blood prince plot, about three or four more flashbacks, an actual explanation of the horcruxes as opposed to dumbledore's ""horcruxes are pieces of a soul in a random piece of crap"" explanation in the movie, there was some of theDursley's, there was some stuff about Sirius, and there was some business with the Order of the Phoenix. Yeah, instead we get, ""I love you more Harry"" ""No I love YOU more Ginny"" and so on with other random characters. I wanted to walk out earlier than halfway through, but was waiting for the battle that never happened. I definitely think that Dobby deserved an appearance after getting cut out of his appearances in 4 and 5, and considering what happens in Hallows.

The acting was pretty mediocre. Rupert Grint was good as Ron with what he was given. Emma Watson was boring as Hermionie. Daniel Radcliffe needs to learn that there's more emotions than pissed off and dead serious. Michael Gambon epically fails as Dumbledore again (Who saw that one coming?), and the rest of the cast was pretty bland.

I felt no emotions other than pure disappointment and boredom coming out of this movie. I felt like an old rag when I came out and that mood lasted for a little while. I nearly laughed at how ridiculous Dumbledore looked falling off the tower in slow motion, and overall felt drained at the end.

Overall, the movie would be a complete waste of time to see, and a waste of money to bother paying for. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.  I would give it less than zero stars if it was possible, and never plan on going anywhere near this abomination ever again. I don't know if I want to bother with Hallows at this point if this clown is going to be directing it. Well, that's all folks.",1257465600,18,3545,4.471406491499227
3041587,4,B000ZECQ08,"*References to spoilers in book!*

It is difficult for me to give less than 5-stars for what I believe is a 6 out of 5 stars book. HBP, in my humble opinion, is one of the greatest of the Rowling series, as it gives a specific insight into the workings of the Dark Lord, and everything in Harry's life starts to make sense. I agree with previous reviewers that this is the darkest book yet, and I think that's one of the drawcards to reading this book. Dumbledore is Harry's protector, mentor, and in the end, the greatest sorcerer of all time; on the other hand, Snape's character is further developed and we are now finally forced to make the decision: is he, or isn't he??

-Good Things-
1) Jim Broadbent is an excellent selection for Slughorn, and his character is as jovial and unique as out of Rowling's novel.

2) I also believe this is the best performance by Michael Gambon as Dumbledore - he appeared too neurotic in the previous films, as Dumbledore is never supposed to be overly-nervous, as he always has an idea of what's going on. The scene in the cave is straight from the book, and we see Dumbledore exactly as Rowling had intended: a vulnerable person, just like everyone else. Plus, the setting was fantastic and very suspenseful.

3) Ron vs. Hermoine! Very enjoyable scenes between these two characters, adding extra humour to a very dark film.

4) Draco Malfoy's character is more prominent in this film, and viewers enjoy seeing a side of the younger Malfoy that perhaps is hinted in the previous films/books - overconfident on the outside, but different on the inside. This scene also shows a side of Harry's character that will further show in the final film.

-Bad Things-
1) For goodness sakes, WHY do they see it as their prerogative to change CRUCIAL sections of the book?? And then add other useless junk?? The waitress - completely unnecessary scene, as we get many glimpses of Harry's developing maturity in other scenes. It made no sense to add it. The fire at the Burrow - this is just plain ridiculous. The Burrow is the place of Harry's salvation, where the Order meet on countless occasions, etc. etc. I don't understand why they chose to burn the place up - where do they propose Ron's family live for the Dealthly Hallows dialogue??!

2) One thing I am really disappointed was removed from the films was the story of Neville's parents. They were NOT killed by Bellatrix Lestrange (as the previous film hinted) - and there was a key scene in this film that gives the background to Neville's determination to prove himself in the final book. Mr. Weasley's attack was removed completely. Moreover, there was what would have been a very funny revival of a glimpse of Lockhart connected with these events - I for one like these references back to earlier books, and am not happy with this exclusion.

3) They also seem to have removed the older Weasley boys from the movies, and this is not acceptible, as Bill, Fleur, and Charley play a key role in battle against the Dark Lord, and Bill's attack by the warewolf gives further credit to their parts to play. The upcoming wedding also sets the scene for the Deathly Hallows and I am sadly thinking perhaps this will be completely removed from the next film.

4) The pensieve scenes, including very interesting flashbacks, were also omitted. They were what makes the Dark Lord's story make sense, and the key flaw in his character. I think more time should have been invested into this story of Tom Riddle, rather than scenes that were not even in the book, and were silly to add.

5) Also, one word: SNAPE! WHY do they cut his role??! Alan Rickman is fantastic, and enjoyable to watch as Snape. They should retain his role, and stop putting his scenes on the cutting room floor.

So, why 4 stars?? Well, it is overall a good enough film, and it is enjoyable to watch. I am nit-picky as someone who has read the books several times, and has really enjoyed the intrigute story behind Harry Potter and Tom Riddle, so perhaps get a bit over-excited about scenes that are not specifically important. It is still a great film to watch, and it will certainly be interesting to see if they retain all the key parts of the final novel - since they're filming the final book in two films, let's hope they're doing this in order to keep all the important content and not simply for revenue raising.",1257465600,27,4370,4.589743589743589

3041589,2,B000ZECQ08,"Although I more or less enjoyed this latest installment in the Harry Potter film franchise, it clearly marks the final divergence of the films from their literary source material. From this point onwards the Harry Potter movies will have very little to do with the core of the Harry Potter novels.

There are a number of reasons for this, many of which can't really be blamed on anything other than the unusual circumstances under which the film series was created. Consider that the first HP film came out before the fifth of the novels had even been written. As a result some of the smaller details in that first film (and the subsequent three films) which at first glance through the pages of the book don't appear to have very much significance were, correctly (based on what the filmmakers knew at the time) cut or deleted from the films. The problem, now that the entire saga has been completed in the books, is that some of those seemingly meaningless details from the earlier books take on tremendous significance, some being absolutely vital for the correct and complete working out of the main story arc. Of course there is no way the filmmakers could have known this as even J.K. herself hadn't yet sat down and ""discovered"" their importance for the latter part of the tale herself.

But the overall effect on the film series is that vast swathes of the story have to either be dropped, clumsily crammed in with hasty and unconvincing supporting exposition that was missed in earlier installments, or totally changed in order to get to a suitable conclusion of the epic in its film version. In other words, the way the books conclude is now virtually impossible to accomplish with the final two films yet to come. (Think trynig to do ""Hamlet"" without Polonius, Ophelia or Laertes. While they might not, in and of themselves, be necessary to the action, without them how does Hamlet maneuver into the position he must occupy in the final show down with the King?)

The other disappointment at this point in the film series is that the ""magic"" is pretty much gone. The sense of wonder has now completely faded and magic is simply another ordinary aspect of the universe where a decidedly grim tale is occurring. In other words, watching this film (and I'm sure the final two yet to come) will be something of a trial. They are setting a tone that is unrelentingly grim, dark, depressing and, perhaps worst of all, rushed and shallow. I doubt if anyone who has never read any of the books or seen any of the other films would look at this installment and enjoy it very much. It now has the overall mood and feel of a cheesy Grade B horror flick. We tend to overlook or forgive that if we've followed every step so far, but in and of itself this latest HP is a weak, grim, sad little mish-mash that has long since left the books far behind.",1257379200,16,2847,4.589390962671906

3041591,5,B000ZECQ08,"I found that this movie was the best to date and the story line was well adapted. Harry and friends are well up to the task of doing what they do. Will everyone quit griping about how much is left in or out of any HP movie, The only thing that I see as a problem is that the horcruxes were not really mentioned and it is assumed that everyone knows what they are. I have read book 7 numerous times so I know what they are and it is facinating to me to see Harry and the gang just pass them by everywhere they go. This is what makes the moview so great. We all know what happens so lets just revel in that fact and move on to number 7 and 8. Lets also keep Mr Yates directing the last 2 OK.I also liked the comedic effect in the Half Blood Prince too. It does not always have to be about Voldemort and what he will do next. Comedy in this film was superb. Thanks for all 6 movies guy2!!!!!",1257292800,3,888,3.8846153846153846
3041592,2,B000ZECQ08,"When I watched the movie felt quite disappointed. I read the book and there was action, laugh, love, mistery, anger, distress, tension, pain... but you won't find any of it in the film, at least not in meaninful quantities. Don't even think of learning something about Voldemort's or the Prince's past or intentions; for that you'll have to read the book, which just happen to be named after the latter caracter, but it seems the producers, directors and script writers didn't know/notice it. I can understand some parts had to be cut in order to fit the movie, but the cut turned into butchery and some important parts didn't receive a good treatment, such as the Unbreakable Vow scene, Dumbledore's pain in the Horcrux Cave, or the final battle in the Castle. Also, olympics jumps from one scene to the other and unnecesary ones such as the burning of the Weasly's family house made this movie not as enjoyable as the previous ones.

We Harry lovers have been waiting through 5 other books and films for that moment, and it was a scene I most looked forward to seeing in the movie.. only to see it replaced with some hideously lame scene about Harry flirting with a girl in a diner. REALLY??????? Guh. I felt robbed by this movie for many reasons, but that was the biggest crime of all.

I'm very worried how underwhelming the next two films will be :(",1257206400,3,581,4.37962962962963
3041594,4,B000ZECQ08,"My main gripe with the previous Harry Potter movie ""Order of the Phoenix"" was that for some strange reason they took the longest of the books and turned it into the shortest Harry Potter movie to date.  The result was that I felt like I was watching the movie fly by on a speeding train, as it rushed from one key event to another without really taking the time to explore anything in detail.

Now we follow up with ""Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"" and....what a difference.  There are plenty of cuts of course, no Harry Potter movie can be free of cuts without being waaaay too long.  But the movie's length was at least comparable to some of the others.  The 3 lead characters were as spot on as ever.  Michael Gambon finally brings a bit more warmth to his portrayal of Albus Dumbledor than he brought to the last few movies.  Tom Felton played Draco Malfoy with all the depth one would hope for in his most important role in the series.  Alan Rickman isn't seen too much as Severus Snape, but when he is he's as wonderful as ever.

I really think this may be the best Harry Potter film yet, and I was really starting to think after the last film that the story had gotten to big for them to manage in film.  Good work guys.",1257120000,53,1235,4.261802575107296

The topics actually covered in the movie are trifling and almost ridiculous (i.e. a group of teachers standing quietly and awkwardly by while two hormone-crazed teens talk about who loves whom...), and the book plot that was disregarded and omitted held so much more depth and detail. This movie is a disappointment for fans of the books I imagine, as it was for me. I find it's treatment of young love insulting not only to teenagers in general, but to the actors and audience as well. I wouldn't avoid this movie as it's a necessary step in the series evolution but it's content is going to be a let down for anyone expecting something with insight or profundity.",1257120000,8,734,4.653846153846154

3041598,2,B000ZECQ08,"First. please let me say that I adore (nay, worship) the Harry Potter stories. So, being a gen-you-wine ""Potter-Head"" I was first in line to see Half-Blood Prince.

It was an interesting movie. Nice special effects.
Disjointed enough however that one MUST have seen all the previous movies and/or read the books to follow the plot.

...Most importantly, it bears little resemblance to the Harry Potter books!!!

Really. I can forgive replacing the actions of one character with another character, to save time, I can even forgive eliminating whole chapters for the sake of brevity, but to change scenes, edit whole parts, and invent whole chapters???

Beware, below, there be SPOILERS! Don't read if you haven't watched!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some examples of lost scenes:

-Dumbledore confronting the Dursley's? Gone.
-The invention of a fight at the burrow, including the destruction of the whole house? Really? Where's Bill & Fleur going to get married next movie? (Oh that's right, in the movies, they AREN'T! Heck, they aren't even in -this- movie!)
-The ""Meeting of the Ministers"" scene? Gone. Heck there's absolutely NO sign of Scrimgeour -anywhere- in the whole movie!
-Tonks rescuing Harry from the train? Nope, now it's Luna, looking for Wrackspurts, and removing Harry's invisibility cloak with her wand. (As A Deathly Hallow, it should be immune to summoning and/or levitation charms.)
-The slow build up leading to the Quiddich victory kiss? Gone. Now just a ""close your eyes"" peck in the Room of Requirement, and this was done horribly!!
-The two months of Harry & Ginny dating? Gone.
-Harry breaking up with Ginny to protect her? Gone!
-Harry's ownership of Grimmauld Place and Kreacher? (Key for the next movie) Gone.
-The Gaunt house flash-backs? Both gone. And with them any mention of Merope, Voldemort's mother. Gone too the mention of her locket by Caractacus Burke.
-The memories of Hokey the house elf, and of Dumbledore's job interview with Voldemort? (Key for the next movie) Gone. In fact, all references to the valuable heirlooms such as Hufflepuff's cup are gone.
-Crabb & Goyle polyjuiceing into girls to stand watch? (would have been funny, but...) Gone.
-Snapes ""Defense Against the Dark Arts"" lessons? Gone.
-Apparition lessons and test? Gone.
-Hermione & Ron's Prefect status? (Well, since it wasn't mentioned LAST film, why mention it now?)
-Harry's appointment as Quiddich captain? (Not mentioned, only implied during the tryouts)
-Mundungus stealing Sirius' property? (KEY for the next movie) Gone.
-Snap's betrayal of Trelawney's prophecy to Voldemort? (HUGE!) Gone!!!
-Harry petrified by Dumbledoor to protect him? GONE!
-The Hogwarts battle between Death Eaters and Order members? (and Bill's disfigurement?) GONE!!
-Dumbledore's funeral? GONE!!!!

...oh sure, we'll probably get to see a few of the minor bits I've mentioned in the ""deleted scenes"" portion of the ""Deluxe"" version of the DVD, but for this screen version, We get such useless add-on scenes as:
-All the trees around the burrow (HP 2/the flying car shot) have been cut down and replaced by a marsh?
-Harry wandering the underground, and chatting up a waitress??
-The aforementioned Burrow fight and subsequent burning??

Not to mention, Harry NOT petrified, but willingly hiding and watching Dumbledore's assassination? (Does anyone besides me see how that fundamentally would change Harry's view of himself?) Yeash!

And WHAT the heck was up with Jessie Cave/Lavender Brown? Worst acting since Brother Sun/Sister Moon! They tested 7000 girls, and they picked a 2nd rate ham? In fact, they tested using the hospital scene, which was single-handedly the worst scene she did in the film!

Ok, ok, on the positive side, the Quidditch tryouts and match were well done, and Dumbledore and Harry's apparition is depicted quite well.

All in all, I am happy they are making Harry Potter movies, but they are -nothing- compared to the books, and THIS one should be prefaced with ""Loosely based on the novel by J. K. Rowling""!!",1256774400,768,4095,5.315301391035549

3041601,1,B000ZECQ08,"Just to give an example of how inadequate this movie is, the title is ""the half-blood prince,"" and it's never fully explained why. They just gloss over it quickly during the rushed finale. Snape says ""by the way, I'm the half blood prince..."" wtf? No battle scene or funeral at the end.  They cut so much fundamental material out of the story, it is just unbelievable. Ends like Monty Python and the holy grail, did they run out of money?",1256688000,22,438,4.475
3041602,4,B000ZECQ08,"I think this is one of the better Harry Potter movies. I liked the humor, especially from Ron (Rupert Grint), who has more to do in this movie and makes the most of his opportunities. The special effects are great and the sense of impending doom is well conveyed via a clever use of muted color- much of the movie is almost sepia. Jim Broadbent, as might be expected, makes Horace Slughorn an interesting addition to the cast. Michael Gambon has not always seemed to find the role of Dumbledore coming naturally to him, but this time round he is at his most convincing. Alan Rickman, as ever, is the creepiest and most mysterious figure in the story, Helena Bonham Carter is the epitome of uncontrolled evil and Daniel Radcliffe brings Harry to life in a way that must now be second nature to him. Emma Watson as Hermione is a little sidelined in this film, but Bonnie Wright as Ginny is now very much a young woman and it's easy to tell why Harry is finally seeing her as something other than Ron's little sister.

The main issue for many people seems to be lack of fidelity to the book. Like most lovers of the books, there are scenes I would have liked to have seen, notably Dumbledore's visit to Privet Drive at the start of the story, but the movie has to be considered on its own merits. The last 4 books are huge and contain far more material than could ever be included in a movie. The director and screenwriter have to consider how to move the story along in order to get to the conclusion; and they have to produce something that will work on the screen. A book can look into people's heads, but a movie needs something to happen to make it watchable. I think they did a good job in this respect and brought the film nicely to the point at which the final showdown can begin. Everything that was included made sense in the context of the story, even though in many respects it wasn't the way the book did it. As other reviewers have said, forget the book and you'll find the movie works very well.

Why only four stars? Simply because the movie is not a complete and self-contained entity. It assumes familiarity with the characters and it leaves the story to be continued. The full set, when it is released in two or three years, will be five stars. This is an instalment in a series- but a very good one.",1256688000,8,2316,4.358796296296297
3041603,5,B000ZECQ08,"I decided to review this movie as I have read reviews of all the Harry Potter movies that have come out. The big thing I notice is that people are upset that they did not follow the book more. Have any of you nerds out there ever seen moveis based on books or comics before? They never follow the book or comic to the letter. I like the Harry Potter films more probably because I have not read the books to have any expectations. But with movies that I have read the book or comic, I don't go into it with the expectation that it will be the book to the letter. You need to go to movies for what they are, entertainment, and try to go and just enjoy them. Unless you are a movie critic, why go so crazy when they didn't make it the way you wanted. These movies are good movies. Film makers will change things from the book to make the movie flow more. Do you realize how long these movies would be if they followed the books to the letter. It would be like ""Gettysburg"" or ""Gods and Generals"", which are 4 to 6 hour movies. They were and are great movies, but they are not the best for theaters because of their length. The film makers are making Harry Potter films for theaters, not for direct to DVD movies. So when the next one comes out, go with no expectations, and see if you just might enjoy the movie more.",1256428800,9,1314,4.116731517509727
3041604,3,B000ZECQ08,"Many of these reviews are spot on. I felt that too much of the book was left out and that the effects were underdone.
My big disappointment is a small thing that just indicates that the care to create the feeling of the magic world was not there in this episode. The pictures in Hogwarts were just, well.... pictures. They did not move, they had no life. This is something that the entire movie lacked.
As far as buying this one, I just hate to do it only to find out there is an extended version coming out in six months. Because this seems to be a pattern for the greedy movie industry I will wait.",1256083200,2,600,4.181034482758621
3041605,5,B000ZECQ08,"Look here's the thing.

Movie and literature are just two completely different mediums. It's hard when you want something to be so faithful to a book without thinking of the big picture that in truth everything doesn't adapt well to the screen. I thought this was the best Harry Potter film effort yet, and those complaining about the ending while I agree it was severely changed I'm sure it's to heighten the suspense for all of the action that is consistant throughout the last book. This film deserves to stand alone as a great film. Not only have all of the students matured acting wise tremendously, but Michael Gambon pulls off really a note-worthy performance and never have I laughed so many times in a Harry Potter film. It paced, and it's best that has come this way.",1255996800,8,777,4.630434782608695
3041606,2,B000ZECQ08,"I have read all the books and seen all the movies to date and I must say I was so disappointed by this movie. My husband, who has not read the books, but seen all the movies, was completely lost in this movie. I had to keep explaining parts to him that were in the book but not in the movie. Or explaining parts that were briefly touched on in the movie, but not explained well enough to make sense to someone who hasn't read the books. They screen writers have really fallen off the wagon in the translation of this book to screen. There were so many things in the movie that needed fleshing out and instead of doing that; the writers threw in scenes in the movie that weren't in the book. I truly hope for the sake of the last two movies that the director reads these reviews and realizes that he needs to find writers who will stay true to the books.

On a separate note, the acting in the movie was excellent. These kids have come quite a long ways in their careers and you can tell. I just watched the HP movies 1 & 2 the other day and it is impressive to see the improvement.

I can only hope for better things in the next two installments. I am seriously considering not adding the last movies to my collection if they continue to go downhill as they have. :(",1255996800,5,1266,4.142276422764228

I will not see the next one at a movie theater.",1255910400,8,334,3.7857142857142856
3041608,4,B000ZECQ08,"As with everything Harry Potter related, I was uber excited to see this film. I was terribly dissapointed with the 5th movie, since it strayed so much from the book. I had high hopes for Half-Blood Prince but I was also a bit nervous. After watching it, I must say as a whole, I was still a bit dissapointed. I know, I really do, that you can't fit everything from a book into a movie. However, what I don't understand is if you have a plot pretty much handed to you on a silver platter, why must you toy with it and destroy it and change it and for what purpose? Yes, 70% of the film was all about romance and heartbreak. Fine, it was very well done and I can deal with that. But when it starts to interfere with the plot, well, then I have issues with that.

This was deemed a 'darker' Potter film and yet, besides the end, I saw nothing of it. The romance aspect really brought things out of balance. And making the film PG did not help matters. Changing characters' personalities did not help matters. And changing the ending certainly didn't score points. Maybe I am being picky but for once I would like to see a Harry Potter film true to the book in tone and plot, like the 3rd film. There is no need to include every minute detail, but please don't CHANGE what is already there. Why mess with perfection? The book was dramatic and it's ending surprising, dark and depressing. The movie's ending was just rushed and seemed to come completely out of nowhere. People that have not read the book would even be confused. Seriously, for those that have not read the book, did you even get the whole 'Half-Blood Prince' thing? Yes, you know who the Prince is, but do you know WHAT it is? There was just no explanation. It was just too rushed. The director and screenplay writer needed to spend less time on romantic scenes, and more on important plot points.

As for the cast, well, it certainly has improved. The 3 principals do a fine job with their roles and they clearly have matured in their acting abilities. I was very impressed. Michael Gambon as Dumbledore does a good job (though in my mind he will never really be Dumbledore), and of course, my favorite actor, Mr Alan Rickman finally has more to do, and yet, though played to utter perfection, still feels underutilized. Sad, really, all things considered...

The special effects are top-notch and flawless and they clearly get better with each film (unlike other things...)

I am giving this film 4 stars regardless of my gripes, because although they changed ALOT, the movie was still enjoyable and well, it IS Harry Potter.",1255651200,2,2589,4.490445859872612
3041609,2,B000ZECQ08,"Okay, so maybe I exaggerated just a wee bit for the sake of a clever title, but for a movie about wizards, Half-Blood Prince sure goes light on the magic. The major plot points and story revelations that made the book so captivating ( i.e. the importance of Horcruxes, the battle leading up to Dumbledore's death, and the mystery of the Half-Blood Prince himself) are reduced to random ""blink and you'll miss it"" moments, if included at all, while the remainder of the 2  hours is padded with unfunny romance blunders aimed at the pre-teen Hannah Montana crowd. Visually stunning as always, yes, but emotionally empty with no climax whatsoever. The director obviously had no vision of where he wanted to take the series and got absolutely nothing accomplished story-wise. I'm not criticizing based solely based on comparisons to the other brilliantly crafted Harry Potter films, or even to the book on which it is (loosely) based, although that is part of it. The bottom line is, it really is an all-around good example of bad film-making in and of itself.",1255564800,18,1056,4.834254143646409
3041610,3,B000ZECQ08,"Warning!  Major spoilers in review!  If you haven't read the books or see the movie, don't read!

The first two Harry Potter movies managed to sum up the contents of the books upon which they were based, but because the books themselves weren't terribly good (the series as a whole is a masterpiece, but not based on the first two books), the movies were terribly good.  There was none of the darkness, danger, and depth of the later novels.  The final three novels in the series turn the Harry Potter series from a merely good series, to what is quite probably the finest long series of books ever written for children (though adults will find them quite as good).  Unfortunately for the films, the books are simply too complex and deep to satisfactorily compress in a film.  At least that is true for THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX and THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE.  We'll see with THE DEATHLY HALLOWS.  Stretching the finale over two novels may make it more successful, but it won't help this film.

I unfortunately made the mistake of seeing this only a few days after rereading THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE.  Had I not, perhaps I wouldn't have been so acutely aware of the tremendous compression taking place in this film.  Huge hunks of the book are eliminated, other hunks are compressed powerfully into rewritten, reimagined sequences.  There are literally hundreds of small alterations, most of them simply to save a few seconds of narrative to get the film to fit the 150 run time.  A few such moments can be forgiven, but the film comes across more as an endless succession of compressions.  Plus there were some odd additions, such as the odd attack at the Weasley's house at Christmas by the Deatheaters.  I didn't mind much seeing the actual attacks by the Deatheaters at the very beginning.  I think that actually gave a nice edge to things.  But by the end of the film I felt like the entire story in the book had been distorted and deformed by the need to force as much of the book's story as possible into a format completely insufficient to contain it.

I didn't actively dislike the movie; I was frustrated by it.  It felt too rushed to provide anything even remotely comparable to the book.  Only the very end of the film had something of the same experience as the book, though even there significant changes were made.  For instance, in the book not even Dumbledore can disapparate from Hogwarts, but instead goes into Hogsmead with Harry to do so.  And in Dumbledore's great death scene, Harry merely hides, not even under his invisibility cloak.  And Snape discovers Harry in the tower before he kills Dumbledore, which sort of signals that Snape's role with regard to Harry is more complex than we might have supposed.  And there is no great battle inside Hogwarts.  This is important because it changes entirely the tone of things.  One of the great things in the battle was the way the other members of Dumbledore's Army come out to fight, with Hermione, Ron, and Ginny engaging in their own acts of bravery.  I could go on and on and on.

Now, I understand as well as anyone that movies are not exact replicas of books.  But I think that film versions shouldn't gratuitously change the book without cessation unless it produces something good in its own right.  The film ended up with some good things, but not as many as it should have.  I liked a lot of individual scenes.  I enjoyed seeing the always enjoyable Jim Broadbent in his role as Slughorn, even though it was as inappropriate for the role as anyone in film (isn't it sad that Leo McKern is no longer living? could anyone have been more perfect for that role than him?).  I loved Alan Rickman, who is possibly the only thing in the movies better than the books, his Snape embodying far more depth than the endlessly one-sided Snape of the books (excepting the final novel).  And it is always great seeing Michael Gambon in anything (THE SINGING DETECTIVE still remains one of the greatest television productions I've ever seen, and while Dennis Potter's amazing script is what made it so great, Gambon is what brought it to life).  I enjoyed the special effects, which were effective without calling too much attention to themselves.  And I've enjoyed watching the group of actors grow and mature in their roles.  Some of them have changed enormously over the years.  Tom Felton (Malfoy) has gotten quite tall, while Bonnie Wright (Ginny) has grown as tall as Daniel Radcliffe.  And Matthew Lewis, who started the series as one of the shorter cast members, is now one of the taller ones. I really like how the main three actors have gotten better as the films in the series have progressed.  I frankly thought Daniel Radcliffe was not very good in the first film, but I think he has become an exceptionally proficient actor.  I think all three will have good post-Harry careers of they want to.

I think fans of the movie may or may not enjoy this.  I always enjoy entering the world of Harry Potter (I'm at this very moment about a third of the way through rereading THE DEATHLY HALLOWS and so had some enjoyment of this film.  But I also found it an enormously irritating experience.  It may be that those who have not read the books might like this more than those that have.  but at this point, has anyone not read the books?",1255478400,19,5300,4.613247863247863

3041613,5,B000ZECQ08,"This is probably the best Harry Potter movie that has been made so far. Even at the beginning of the movie, I was impressed with the graphics and flow.

In general, I found the movie thrilling and suspenseful, the characters easy to care for and an overall success. There were a few points left out which is forgivable due to time constraints as it is already quite a long movie. The only thing that I would have changed is that about half way through the movie, there is a strange scene that was an addition from the book. I won't go into detail as I don't want to ruin it but it seemed unnecessary and also could prevent important events from occurring (or at the very least change them) in the movies to follow. All in all, it's definitely worth watching for even the most casual of HP fans.",1253836800,12,998,4.342245989304812
3041614,4,B000ZECQ08,"First, the flaws.  The waitress scene in the beginning was unnecessary and took away from other elements that should have been included.  More time at the joke shop would have been good.

The fire at The Burrow was well done, and added another dimension to the movie.  However, the only inkling we got of the relationship between Lupin and Tonks was her calling him sweetheart just before the attack.  Very jarring, even for those of us who knew they were a couple.

There were a lot of scenes that were very well done, but what made the movie for me was Dumbledore.  Michael Gambon finally got the character right and just in time.  His interpretation of our beloved headmaster in the previous movies left me cold, and I was concerned that I wouldn't care about the character's final fate.  Not so.  Those final scenes were everything I could have wished.",1253836800,4,856,4.6466666666666665
3041615,3,B000ZECQ08,"I have not read the original books by J. K. Rowling, so my review of the sixth Harry Potter film is purely based on my experience of seeing the film alone, not comparing the adaptation with the original. And my simple impression is this; Harry Potter needs a new director. OK, I know it is too late, but I believe I am not the only one who feels that way about the latest entry.

As you know, there is one crucial episode involving major character(s) at the end of ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince."" Remember, before you actually see this fairly engrossing climax, you have to wait very long. I know the sixth installment of Harry Potter series has to lay the groundwork for the two-film finale - ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part I"" and ""Part II"" - so the film's long running time (153 minutes) is understandable. Still, the wait is very long.

That is because the filmmakers have no idea how to create a compelling narrative. Director David Yeats handles everything in the complicated interactions between characters surrounding Harry as if making a series of formulaic TV shows. The film goes on and on, but doesn't know where it should go. The suspense is half-hearted at best and the film fails to build up any tension toward the climax. The romances of Harry, Ron and Hermione are told without style or nuance. As to the titular ""Prince"" it seems they forget this should be one of the key elements that play an important role at this entry's ending. But what should I expect from the director who in the previous Harry Potter film wasted brilliant Gary Oldman and his intriguing character Sirius Black in such a horrible way?

I am not saying ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" is a terrible disaster. It is not. With the first-rate actors, first-rate production designs (Hogwarts are so beautiful) and first-rate effects, it cannot be. Still this is the weakest link of the series, and I am afraid it is not because of the book itself.",1253491200,9,1965,4.640804597701149
3041616,1,B000ZECQ08,"I'm a great fan of the books and the first four movies.  I was sorely disappointed in David Yates' adaptation of The Order of the Phoenix and afraid he'd do as poorly with The Half Blood Prince.

As a bit of background, I re-read Order of the Phoenix before seeing the movie and was, probably, more disappointed than I might have been had I not been as familiar with the text at the time I saw the movie.  At that point I made a vow not to re-read Half Blood Prince before going to the movie.  Unfortunately, it was a vow I was unable to keep.  I read the book, aloud, with a friend, just before going to the movie.  I should have known something was up when I was able to show up at the theatre on the first weekend of the film's opening and just buy two tickets for the same day (I live in NYC)!

The books get darker as the series progresses and Half Blood Prince is the darkest yet.  There are so many things in the book that serve to set up The Deathly Hallows and so few of them were actually portrayed, or portrayed well, in the film.  I was devastated to learn that David Yates was directing the last two films, as I was so unhappy with Order of the Phoenix, however, ""unhappy"" doesn't come close to the way I felt after actually seeing Half Blood Prince.

I question whether Yates has ever read the books (and if he did, did he like them???) or if he only read the treatment for the scripts?  There are several places in the book that cause me to not just cry, but to weep.  I wondered if I could make it through the movie and not look like a complete dishrag when I left.  I believe this will illustrate my feelings fairly well:  When the credits rolled, I looked at my friend and said, ""So, where do you want to eat?""

I don't believe I shed one tear and I think that says it all.  If you want more: you know how die-hard fans always stay for the credits?  Almost the entire theatre got up and walked out as the credits began to roll.

Will I buy this 1-star DVD?  Yes, I want to complete my collection and I continue to have hopes that the two-part ending will, somehow, be better--although with David Yates at the helm, I very much doubt it.  What a shame.",1253404800,42,2169,4.131264916467781

David Yates has got it right and I am very pleased with his work on Order of the Phoenix and Half-Blood Prince.  I trust Deathly Hallows will be just as good :-)

3041618,1,B000ZECQ08,"The other Potter films told the story badly. THIS one didn't tell the story at ALL. Watching it is like watching a series of random, animated book illustrations. Oh, here's the scene where Slughorn is introduced, here's a scene where some black chick hits on Harry Potter, here's the scene where Ron sucks at Quiddich, here's the scene where Hermione has her feelings hurt for some reason, here's the scene where Dumbledore sets fire to a bunch of zombies, and now Dumbledore is d- I mean, incapacitated. (No spoilers!)

I read the Harry Potter books, and I remember the story. When I see a movie adaptation of a book, I expect to see a story reproduced in movie form. Yeah, maybe the movie's story will not be exactly the same as books story, and maybe the movie will not be as good as the book; but, at the very least, I expect it to be, oh, you know, A MOVIE, with a plot and everything. I don't want to see a character simply walk onto the set, announce that he's Snape, and act out a few random Snape scenes. If I wanted to see a bunch of disconnected characters jumbled together I'd go to a Harry Potter convention or something.

Oh, and by the way, all of these moving illustrations are pretty ugly. You know, just because this movie is supposed to be ""darker"" than past wizard movies, doesn't mean they have to literally film it in black and white, and design the set to look as soul-sucking as possible. Oddly enough, there's actually a scene where Harry Potter stands in front of Hogwarts, which now looks like the bleakest place on earth, and says, ""I forgot how beautiful this place is."" Pffft. Why can't he see the irony?

After I saw this movie I complained the about the bad writing to someone who saw the movie, but never read the book. She claimed I was being too hard on it, she claimed she understood the plot perfectly. So, I asked her who the Half-Blood Prince was. Her response? ""Oh, I thought they were going to explain that in the next movie.""",1252886400,41,1967,4.428176795580111

When the release of Half Blood Prince was delayed I thought I would go crazy waiting. With incredible anticipation I filed in with the masses to see it when it finally hit the theaters and much like the Goblet of Fire, was immediately disappointed by the absence of the Dursleys. And then who would have thunk it, but no Voldamort either. The last thing I was hoping for was a teenaged hormone-ladened skit. Though at times, Harry's humor was semi-entertaining, the only true Potter parts were the scenes with Malfoy. Quite frankly, the entire story line in the movie was irrelavent to the series. And the fact the 7th book had long ago been released ( and read) took all the guess work out of this movie. We already know why Snape killed Dumbledore and that Snape is the unsung hero. It has taken me this long to write a review for the sheer fact I was having trouble admitting the movie was a failure. Even the music score was pieces taken from past movies. Will I buy the DVD when released ? Of course. I own each book and movie and will most likely watch this movie again hoping that since I know it stinks already, I won't be so disappointed.",1252886400,4,1270,4.385593220338983

Gambon is a great actor, but until this installment, I did not think that he adequately portrayed the character that fans of the book hold so dear. He was alternately too gruff, too clueless, and too weak. I think that this must have been due to writing instead of his acting, however, because he was GREAT in Half Blood Prince. Even with the added scenes that were not in the book, I felt that this installment remained truest to the book. I went to see this movie three times- and this is coming from someone who never goes to the movies. I am truley surprised that other reviewers have not given HBP more stars.

While this may be harmless, there are forces at work that are anything but.  The death eaters are growing in strength and becoming more vicious, killing several muggles in a terrorist attack.  Diagon Alley is all but deserted, only Fred and George Weasley's joke shop is thriving.  Hogwarts has increased security, incoming students are being searched and the entire school is surrounded by a magic force field.  Harry is recruited by Dumbledore to convince former Hogwarts professor Horace Slughorn to return to Hogwarts as the new potions teacher.  The task proves simple.  Slughorn is eager to return to Hogwarts, particularly with Harry Potter as a potential student.  Harry will later be required to do things not so simple.  Dumbledore believes Slughorn has valuable information that could be used against Voldermort and hopes Harry can find it out.  Slughorn has taken a definite liking to Harry, who has become one of his better students.  Of course, Harry has some help.  He is using an old potion book with very accurate notes courtesy of ""the half-blood prince"" (whoever he is).  Unfortunately, there is danger.  Despite the security precautions, Dumbledore is the target of assassination attempts.  Harry suspects Draco may be up to something, he has already been seen with wanted criminals.  Later on, death eaters attack and burn the Weasley house to the ground.  Eventually, Harry gets Slughorn to give Dumbledore a memory that confirms Dumbledore's worst fears about Voldermort, and a way to destroy him!  Will Harry and Dumbledore be able to use Voldermort's own strength against him?  Will they uncover the truth about the assassination attempts?  Will they be able to survive a Trojan-horse style invasion of Hogwarts?

Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince reminds me of the start of A Tale of Two Cities - ""It was the best of times, it was the worst times.""  In some ways this is one of the best Harry Potter films made.  In others, though, it lags.  The storyline involving Ron Weasley and quiddich could have easily been done away with, the teenage romance could have been reduced to a couple of minutes.  Fortunately, the movie resolves its teen angst portion in time to get back to the main plot.  That is why Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince has been a success.

3041622,3,B000ZECQ08,"This remarkably well balanced series of wildly successful films based on an equally popular series of novels by J. K. Rowling shows no signs of waning with Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.  Potter veteran director David Yates and keeper of the flame scribe Steve Kloves have kept together a burgeoning franchise that is laying the foundation for a grand finale.

A new school year begins, and Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is coming to terms with being the `chosen one' to do battle against the ultimate in evil wizardry, Lord Voldemort and the evil Death Eaters surrounding Hogwart.  Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) enlists Harry to serve as bait to draw out the supremely evil Voldemort.  An older Professor Slughorn (Jim Broadbent) returns to the school and brings with him a mysterious history of having taught the boy who became Lord Voldemort.  Harry in the meantime discovers a manuscript by the `Half-Blood Prince' and thinks that it is the key to learning the wizardry secret that will enable Harry and his comrades, Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) to defeat the man who killed his parents and godfather, Sirius Black.  Harry's school rival Draco harbors revenge against him for the death of his evil father.  There is the aerial game Quidditch that challenges Ron's mettle, and the blossoming of adolescent romance between Potter and Ron's sister, Ginny and between Ron and  Hermione.  Then there is Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) and some mysterious behavior that questions his allegiance.  As Dumbledore makes Harry promise to do whatever he instructs, the Death Eaters are unleashed within Hogwart with devastating consequences and a shocking betrayal that will forever change the destiny of the school and foreshadow the coming showdown with Voldemort.

This is a more grownup Potter as it explores relationships more thoroughly and some amusing situations arise such as a love triangle that plagues Ron.  It is amusing to see how hormones are thriving amongst the teens and love is in the air.  Growing up was never this hard. There are also surprises of a high order that will send the series on a new, ominous path while raising questions about the loyalty of a major player. The one constant is our beloved trio of maturing wizards who must face an uncertain future without an important character.  The film reinforces the continuous themes of loyalty and friendship among our wizard heroes.  That bond and natural chemistry among the three actors is partly what holds this remarkable series together.

Most of the characters are back from the previous film Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.  It does feel like school has restarted when Professors Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall (venerable Maggie Smith) show up.  Other familiar faces reappear, which greatly help in the continuity and progression of the story.  The filmmakers are wise to introduce a couple new characters here and there without shaking up the status quo too much.  All the Potter films have benefited from a strong focus on storyline in keeping with the novel sources.

Production values are topnotch again, and the dark, moody colored cinematography is an artistic triumph. It is impressive at how mainstream films have pushed the creative aspects of filmmaking without sacrificing popularity; witness the cinematography and art direction of The Dark Knight and the film editing in The Bourne Ultimatum.  It has almost become pass to expect imaginative state of the art special effects in the Potter films, but they are always serving the plot and not merely to draw attention to the spectacle itself.

Since these are British performers, there is a bit of adjusting to their heavy British accents.  This film, perhaps more than any other, assumes that the audience is already well versed on Potter lore, and so it may prove a bit confusing to the uninitiated.  It starts out well and tries one's patience just a tad as it builds a complex narrative that loses steam half-way through and picks up momentum toward the end and never lets up with a devastating payoff which in turn sets up the two part finale in grand fashion.

Though not the best film of the series, The Half-Blood Prince sets the table for the final battle of good versus evil.  This must be a pretty good film because I can't wait for the final installments.",1251590400,,4355,5.004160887656034

3041625,4,B000ZECQ08,"This is the sixth installment of the Harry series, and by now, Harry has grown resigned to the fact that being the Chosen One might put a damper on your love life.  In the opening scene, it looks like he might get lucky, but then Dumbledore shows up with yet another mission.  This time it's to recruit Professor Slughorn (Jim Broadbent) to teach at Hogwarts.  The plot is the same essentially; as Voldemort tries once again to defeat Harry and fails. Throw in some Quidditch footage, wacky hormonal high jinks among the Hogwarts' student body, and some cool special effects, and there's your movie. Only Tom Felton as Draco has replaced Voldemort as the designated sneerer, which is good because he's a lot more photogenic.

As reviewers have noted, you won't understand the title's meaning unless you've also read the book.  It might not matter much now, but could require some more explanation in the next two movies.  Then and again, if you're just seeing it for entertainment and not because you care about the books, it shouldn't matter. If you are familiar with the books, though, you will probably be going, ""Huh?"" at a few scenes.",1250812800,,1139,4.756345177664975

Granted, reducing 650-odd pages into a motion picture that runs in a reasonable amount of time is a daunting task, but forays into totally made up sequences (specifically the visit of Bellatrix LeStrange, Fenrir Greyback, etc to The Burrow), does nothing to advance the plot.

However, I did enjoy the interior of the set of the Hogwarts castle, as they made it seem much more like what I would expect a castle to look like.

Much more could and should have been made of the pensive sequences, especially with regard to Dumbledore's admonition to include Ron and Hermione in what Harry learned, especially given its relevance to the final book.  Much more could also have been made of Harry's obsession with discovering what Draco was up to, although those seemed to lack any real hint of what was going on in those sequences (but I have to admit that I liked Tom Felton's portrayal as well as his costume).

Yes, I'll get the DVD when it becomes available, if only to have the complete collection.  I just hope I don't also find a Draught of Living Death handy when I watch it.  Come to think of it, maybe Steve Kloves was under its influence when he penned this abomination.",1250726400,10,1454,4.65625
3041627,4,B000ZECQ08,"Professor Minerva McGonagall: [to Harry, Ron, & Hermione] Why is it, that whenever anything happens, it's always you three?
Ron Weasley: Believe me, Professor. I've been asking myself that same question for the past six years.

Short attention span summary (SASS):

1. Dark times are at hand for both wizards and muggles, as the Death Eaters wreak a destructive path across both worlds.
2. Draco has a special assignment from you-know-who, which has his mum distressed enough to seek a bodyguard for him.
3.  Hogwarts turns into hormone central as teenagers start getting googly-eyed, and sometimes enlist magical assistance in matters of the heart.
4. Quidditch is always good entertainment, and so is a little walk down memory lane, a hunt for a dark treasure and a dramatic ending.
5. Still not enough Bellatrix Lestrange (the always amazing Helena Bonham Carter) - MORE MORE!!!

This is a rather good interpretation of a book that was largely about young love at Hogwarts (except of course for the ending), and although it was long, it held the interest painlessly.  I never expected much from this one, seeing as it isn't much more than a scene setter for the two grand finales, and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was.

The young actors have settled down well in their roles, and the rest of the cast fit as comfortably as always.  Jim Broadbent makes a perfect Horace Slughorn, and Alan Rickman, Helena Bonham Carter and Dame Maggie Smith (albeit in a small role this time) continue to excel.  Kudos also to Bonnie Wright who plays Ginny Weasley, a character that has finally come into her own on screen.

Highly recommended for all Potter fans, even if only to get your fix before the next movie.

Albus Dumbledore: You must be wondering why I brought you here.
Harry Potter: Actually Sir, after all these years I just sort of go with it.

The film is dark and captures the gravity and seeming hopelessness that accompany the Dark Lord's return; however, the movie also captures the determination of Harry and his friends to fight the emerging evil, no matter the cost.  The actors have come into their own and have really grown into their parts, much as Harry, Ron and Hermoine have grown and matured in the books.

 Scarred by his experience stemming from the events in ""The Order Of The Phoenix"", Harry Potter is reluctant to return for year six at Hogwarts. Professor Dumbledore encourages him to continue on, taking Harry's help in enticing former Potions Professor Horace Slughorn to return to Hogwarts.

 At the school, Harry & Ron borrow textbooks from the school for Slughorn's Potions class. The previous owner of Harry's copy, the ""Half-Blood Prince"", has annotated the book with additional instructions & spellcraft that allow Harry to excel in class & win a vial of liquid luck.

 During private meetings held throughout the year, Dumbledore shows Harry memories of a young Tom Riddle & reveals Slughorn retains a memory critical to Voldemort's defeat. Harry retrieves the memory & it reveals that Voldemort had been seeking information on Horcruxes, devices that safeguard a portion of the creator's soul, thereby granting him immortality until the Horcrux is destroyed. After learning the location of another Horcrux (Voldemort has six of them total), Dumbledore requests Harry's help to retrieve it.

 However, Voldemort has given Draco Malfoy, Harry's rival, an assignment. An assignment that casts a deadly spell over Hogwarts & spells certain doom for the faculty, students, & the school's future.

 The overall power of ""Half-Blood Prince"", is the storm, that the other five films have been fortelling about, has finally arrived & this is the beginning of the end for all things Potter.

This movie sets out to set up for the 7th films and build up the relationships and it succeeds at both.  The most important part of the film is that it is well made, the acting is spectacular, the effects are impressive, and the scenes flow together better than the last few Harry Potters.  To touch on the acting, Jim Broadbent is brilliant as Professor Slughorn, whose facial expressions were hilarious.  Michael Gambon holds his own and gives an impressive performance.  Finally Alan Rickman is given a bigger role and he shines also.  The three main characters go through a lot with their relationships in this one and they handle it well.  I felt the film found the right balance between comedy and action.  If it weren't for the comedy the film would have that Dark Knight feel (loved the film) where it is entertaining but also very dark and depressing.  Overall, although Voldemort does not make an appearance, the film is the darkest and for me was the most entertaining.

Yates nails the romantic relationships (Lavender is especially great), but this film is almost completely humorless.  No chaos, no ghosts, no delight, no madness, no fun.  It's dark, and it's only going to get darker.  Yawn.

The biggest travesty is Jenny and Harry's first kiss.  That was a fantastic moment in the book, which Yates inexplicably made Hollywood ordinary.

Michael Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore, yet again, misses the character.  The actor steadfastly stated that he refused to read the books.  I'm not sure WHY he thought that this would benefit his characterization.  It does not.  I've cringed watching him screw up one of the most important characters.

If you want a GREAT adaption of all of the books, listen to the audio versions by Jim Dale.  Jim Dale single-handedly nails all of the parts.

They make up the beginning of the movie, when Dumbledore pick up Harry; they include quidditch again( what's the point); they make up a sequence where the Burrow is destroyed, but DON'T include important things like the will of Sirius Black, Harry hiding the book, Dumbledore telling Harry what he believes the Horcruxes are( and obviously the memories where these objects are shown), the fight against the death eaters in Hogwarts and the funeral. The story is just incomplete in this movie, even more so than in the Order of the Phoenix, because what they left out in this one are so crucial to the storyline.

Editing: The movie has no flow whatsoever. They jump from one scene to another in fast pace with no transitions, without bothering to properly end one scene before another starts. It makes for a not very enjoyable movie.

Acting: The three main actors make Steven Seagal look like an Oscar winner. Other characters, like Lavender Brown or Ginny are just as poor. The adult actors are better, but still not as good as they would be with more talented youth.

There are some scenes that are good, though. Katie being cursed and Dumbledore fighting off the Inferi are the two most memorable ones, but they just don't make up for the poor writing, editing an acting in the movie.",1249689600,39,1521,4.643122676579925
3041637,2,B000ZECQ08,"I didn't care for this movie.  I found it to be slow and boring.  I think the problem was there was too much TALK (or dialogue) and not enough ACTION.  I just didn't feel this movie moved all that much--like a Jason Bourne or Indiana Jones movie.  I have never fallen asleep during a Harry Potter movie, but I did twice during this movie.  Not recommended.",1249430400,9,356,4.333333333333333
3041638,5,B000ZECQ08,"The first time I hear Harry Potter'books it was by a friend who bought the book to her son. He has enjoyed the books and my friend too. I have to say I was not convinced. Another friend told me she was delighted to read the books that she borrowed from her nephew. She is a contemplative sister and as I know her I was not surprised. But I have waited to watch the first movie. I have liked all the movies til now.
When the last book was published I decided to buy all the books at once. However, if my mother tongue is French but I decided to buy them in English to enjoy more the books as I watched all the movie in English. I read all the books at once. I enjoyed them a lot. I read them again and again. I watch the available movie again too. The main reason makes me enjoyed Harry Potter is how the author offered us the story of a boy who is growing old in each book. In each book I have seen Harry Potter to act according to his age and no more. When I read the seventh book I was amazed to discover that the adult characters had a life outside of the books. I have started thinking to make the movies in these conditions was a big challenge because only the author has known where and how she wanted to lead us till the end of the story.

I understand that to make a movie with so many characters around Harry Potter is very difficult. And also the size of each book growing like Harry Potter growing older was certainly making the writing of the screenplays quite difficult. That is why I appreciate the Half Blood Prince a lot. It is different from the books but the spirit of the books is respected. The movies offer us another perspective of understanding sometimes. But I do not forget that it is movie language and not book language. The quality of the movie narration is very good. It is difficult to forget for a while the seventh book if you already read it and watching the sixth movie. But if you try watching the movie in the perspective of Harry Potter it becomes very dark with some moments of brief light as the movie director wants.

A last piece of advice go and watch the other movies made by each actors playing adult characters. You will realize how wonderful actors they really are. Even Ruppert Grint.

So enjoy Harry Potter'movie like me. Do not forget you are only sixteen this time and you are full of grieves to lose those you love one by one just like Harry Potter.",1249257600,2,2400,4.2017353579175705
3041639,5,B000ZECQ08,"I thought it was the best film rendering of any of the books so far.  It left a lot out but it seemed to layer more information in around the plot proper than any other the others have, without things in the background, newspaper articles, subtleties in the frame...  I must say, the acting for the most part was spot-on.  Emma did the best in this one since Sorcerer's Stone.  She brought a lot more to it than eyebrow posturing, for a change.  Rupert was great, as usual, and Daniel has widely improved his skills.  He has progressively gotten better and better, but he was fabulous in this one.  I like that he gets to explore his comedic side, pincers included.  His potion drunk Harry was a lot like his lecherous celebrity child in Extras, which if you haven't seen is hysterical (Youtube).  Tom Felton really stepped it up as Draco, which in a way seemed to be breaking the wall a bit by revealing so much of his story so quickly, and not through Harry's perspective.  But then I thought that about how the book was written, as well.  Jessie Cave as Lavender was perfect.  She hit it right-on, and that's a big undertaking for a high profile character played by an unknown actress near the end of a huge film franchise.  I actually wanted to be on the bus for HP/GW, but even in the film I just didn't feel it.  Dan and Bonnie had no chemistry whatsoever, and that's too bad considering she's slated for minimal face time in the next installment and we're supposed to buy their relationship 100%.  Rickman, heavenly.  Just superb.  He really stole that film with his understatement of Snape.  The one that I thought and still think just does not capture the essence of the role as she was written is Helena Bonham Carter as Bella.  In the books Bella wasn't punch-nuts crazy.  She was evil and sinister, and Carter has missed that mark from the beginning.  That is a persisting disappointment to me.

This installment brought a lot more to the table, finally.  I'm pleased to see the series slide beyond children's film to a real, complex, plot.  The moments with Katie Bell and the inferi were truly horrifying.  The visits with young Tom were creepy and intensely sad, their correlation with Harry and the potential of both boys sufficiently entwined.  That same thing could be said of Draco, whose objectives are grim and melancholy, as well.  The cave scene sealed Dumbledore's fate for Harry as Harry accepted that rite of passage into his own power by agreeing to do everything he was told without question.  Harry's brush with Tom's ring sent shivers of compatibility through him, leaving the audience cringing and piqued.  Daniel nailed a unique body language for his likeness to Voldemort in the previous film, and he sealed himself as Harry, not just that guy playing him, by reviving it in this one.  Gone was the distracting angst of the last two films.  I still think that the grief over Sirius was never really processed in the books, thus isn't in this film.  Nothing in the story as it was given indicated that Harry had grieved and was past it, or that he had set it aside to push through the tasks ahead.  It just became a nonfactor and that's an oversight in the development of his character that is rarely touched upon in the film.  As well, the progression of the plot through the pensieve was lost in the film.  I don't think that what we saw in the film left viewers with enough appreciation of those memories or why they were relevant, to start with.  The missing funeral at the end was a let down.  I really wanted to see the visual display of that ritual, for the characters as much as for myself.  In light of that and the lack of processing of Sirius' death, the series (book and film) lacks a real ability to deal with death, yet the threat of that we're supposed to believe that is exactly what compels our young cast to save the world.

In all I have high hopes for the remaining film(s) in the series.  If they are done anywhere as well as this one we're in for a riveting treat.",1249171200,4,4018,4.503457814661134
3041640,5,B000ZECQ08,"HP and the Half-blood Prince foreshadows the completing of the series in the 2-part Deathly Hallows.  As such, it does a masterly job of setting the stage of the hunt for the horcruxes and the sorting out of whom ends up with whom.  It also sets the stage, perhaps better than books, for why Harry doesn't become the head of Hogwarts and instead spends his life among the Muggles--he's certainly had enough excitement for a lifetime.  And as the ""famous"" Harry Potter he will also have had his fill of magic, potions, and spells.  Dumbledore would have wanted Harry to have a productive and happy life after such a tempestuous childhood; and if that meant setting aside the magic, well, Dumbledore would have understood.  When you lose everyone who means something to you (Mom, Dad, Sirius, Dumbledore, Hedwig), then being present in the real world to what is left (Ginny, Hermione, and Ron) is all the more important, especially more important than magic.  I've read reviews that fault Daniel Radcliffe for his performance, but I actually think he's done a really amazing job of illuminating the maturing Harry whose life will be more an illustration of his mother's love, than his father's youthful brashness with its streak of meanness.  I like to think that Lily had the same long-term effect upon James as her memory has had upon Harry.",1248998400,,1341,4.829694323144105
3041641,5,B000ZECQ08,"Last night I saw Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince with 2 friends. One had seen (but not read the books) two films, and the other had  not read or seen Harry Potter. They loved the movie. And so did I. The movie is very dark (not just visually), the actors are good, better and superb. The movie script was excellent and kept very nicely with the book. The editing was superb (for a from book to movie). The cuts were so good that you know what happens between one scene and the abrupt move into the next: such as jumping from the inception of some action (as when Prof. Dumbledore tells Harry he will have to come with him to find one of the horcruxes).

I do know that the young actors are older than the characters they are portraying, but each one did an excellent job making their roles work. I may be suspending my disbelief because I want them to be what their characters are. We all suspend our doubts when we go to the movies. Afterall, we know what we're seeing needs the contribution of our imagination to make it work and be enjoyable.

All in all, while it does not have the wonder and liberated happiness of the first 3, 4 films, and I believe is somewhat over the heads of the many young people who love the HP series, it delivers on all aspects of a great evening at the cinema.",1248912000,2,1299,4.229838709677419
3041642,5,B000ZECQ08,"A well written script by Steve Kloves, beautiful cinematography by Bruno Delbonnell, the most emotional score by Nicholas Hooper, and great performances by an ensemble cast, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is the most charming, and magical so far of all the Harry Potter films released so far. David Yates, who's feature film debut was the previous entry Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, outdoes himself in this beautiful adaptation. At 2 hours and 33 minutes, the film's pacing was perfect thanks to the vastly improved editing by Mark Day. Many book fans will miss their favorite scenes, but should be able to appreciate the film staying faithful to the story. To those who have not read the books, its better to watch this film more than once, to let the story sink in, because a lot is going on in this packed film. Watch for an especially wonderful performance by actors Sir Michael Gambon as Professor Dumbledore, the beloved mentor of Harry and Headmaster of Hogwarts, and a hilarious but charming performance by Jim Broadbent as the new Potions Master Horace Slughorn, who will make you laugh and cry.",1248825600,3,1126,4.839378238341969
3041643,3,B000ZECQ08,"I left the midnight showing of `Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince' disappointed. Few critics consider any Harry Potter movie a masterpiece, but I enjoy every one. Understandably, significant scenes in the books must be altered or deleted in the film version. However, the changes made in this movie make the film far more tedious than the methodical but intriguing sixth book. The film's portrayals of some aspects of the story are spot on, but the film fails to build up to a satisfying climax.

The movie begins with a poignant shot of the young wizard Harry Potter being photographed by journalist after the traumatic death of his godfather Sirius Black. Further successfully sinister shots of graying sky ensue as black wisps soar through a skull-shaped cloud.

Unfortunately, this dark mood is never matched during the rest of the film. A sense of danger is never developed, and personal conflicts are far less acutely depicted than the outstanding special effects. Harry (played by Daniel Radcliffe) has even less personality than usual, and his love story with Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright) is ridiculous and unrealistic - even for a story about wizards. Instead of teenage sexual tension and a likeable, bold heroine, we get a temptress who is suddenly in love with Harry because ... the script said so. Ginny whispers lines as though she is some sort of teenage temptress, yet there is no chemistry there.

Hermione (Emma Watson) is yet again made to look very much like a stereotypical girl, weeping over her good friend Ron's (Rupert Grint) apparent rejection of her amorous affections (while she is emotional but far more plucky and resilient in the books). Much more interesting than Ron, Hermione, Harry, and Ginny are the two other love interests, Lavender Brown (Jessie Cave) and Cormack McLaggen (Freddie Stroma). Brown's infatuation with Ron is amusingly over the top, but Stroma's brief role as the boorish Cormack pursuing Hermione is absolutely hysterical.

Michael Gambon's caring portrayal of headmaster Dumbeldore is gently moving, and Jim Broadbent is excellent as Slughorn, giving depth to Harry's well-intended but batty and deeply flawed potions teacher. As Professor Snape, Alan Rickman is as always subtle, but his portrayal differs a bit from the book, arguably giving less impact to the characters ultimate role in the story. The death-eater and werewolf Fenrir Greyback (Dave Legeno) makes an appearance and looks fantastically threatening. Unfortunately, he is not given a single line or action to convey any aspect of his depraved nature. The character of Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) has vastly improved from his previous sniveling incarnations. In nearly every scene Felton and cinematographers convey his isolation, and he is as pitiable and dangerous as any terrified adolescent criminal.

Other highlights of the film include flashbacks about the evil Voldemort, known in the past as Tom Riddle. The two actors who portray him not only greatly resembled each other, but are spot on in their depictions of snakelike evil. The youngest Tom's (Hero Fiennes-Tiffin) subtle expression of delight at a display of power is chilling. The older Tom (Frank Dillane) possesses a sinister intelligence and serpentine manner.

`Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince' was probably the most difficult of the series to adapt because of its lack of a driving plotline, and the movie is thematically unfocused and at best uneven. Though I've read the books, I was frequently confused. There is much potential here, but little payoff.",1248739200,9,3558,5.211538461538462

3041645,2,B000ZECQ08,"My son and I went to see this movie yesterday.  I was so looking forward to it and after watching it I was very disappointed.  They took one of the smaller aspects of the book and focused on it.  The first three chapters of the book were not even in the movie!  I don't know what they were thinking!  The Harry Potter movies started going downhill with the Order of the Phoenix, although that one still wasn't too bad!  HP and the Half Blood Prince was just plain boring.  The movie is 1 hr. 53 minutes long and felt like 4 hours!  What happened to the action? And by the way what happend to the great musical score they had through the first four movies?  Why would they change or eliminate the theme song? The only redeeming factor was the acting was still very good which is why I gave it 2 stars.  They sure missed the mark with this movie.

 Makes me wonder what the final two movies will be like.",1248652800,13,902,4.180232558139535
3041646,5,B000ZECQ08,"You get your money's worth with the new Harry Potter.  We went to the 7:15 show and didn't get out till 10:05.  Well, we sat through 11 previews for films the theater owners must think will appeal to the Harry Potter crowd, but all of them look pretty crummy.  How bad does Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs look!  And what about that movie where the kid goes into the elevator of the Empire State Building at night and the whole elevator cab trembles with white light all the way up?  It looks like Harry Potter USA!  So naturally when the real thing came on it looked even better than it is, and that's saying a lot.

In short it was great.  I have a few nit picks because, well, I didn't reed the books and couldn't figure out half the stuff that was going on.  Luckily we went with a friend and could text back and forth saying, ""Mark, who is that woman with the crazy black hair?"" (Helena Bonham Carter) and ""How about the woman with the white hair?"" (Narcissa, her sister.)  That didn't take us much further.  I have seen the previous 5 movies but I sort of forgot, and when David Thewlis made his appearance at the Burrow I had completely lost trach of who Remus was.  Why didn't they leave him out, he certainly didn't add much to this one, and as for his wife, the poor actress who played her must have eagerly grabbed the script then screamed in despair when she found out she was only going to say one thing and wear one ugly outfit!  As for the family that adopted Harry, they probably were screaming even louder when they realized they had been cut out of the entire movie!

I liked Daniel Radcliffe, who has really grown as an actor, Rupert Grint not so much, but he was OK, but if possible Emma Watson has regressed!  Gone backwards!  Scene after scene left her defenseless, unable to organize even the semblance of a performance.  She's not even as pretty as she used to be.  Oh well, she's still great, but Luna and Lavender trample all over her acting wise.  The adults are just going through their paces.  A few times it looked like Dumbledore was catching forty winks, while talking.  Best performance, the zombie skeleton creatures who swim up out of a lagoon and snatch humans.  Afterwards we agreed it was some sort of allegory about people who are too needy.",1248566400,3,2282,4.39618138424821
3041647,3,B000ZECQ08,"Near the end of the movie, Dumbledore says to Harry Potter, ""I sometimes forget how much you've grown.""  Well, let me tell you, it must be senility, because he's the only one who hasn't noticed.  With Harry's five o'clock shadow and the clear growth shared by Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ronald (Rupert Grint), I half expected a McLovin fake ID subplot.  Either they've extended eligibility by red-shirting a year, or they failed a grade, but at this point they've been attending school longer than anyone except Radio.

As for the movie itself, it's stuck in a Twilight impersonation, with the aging trio gaining more experience with teen angst than wizardy.  Unfortunately, the threesome hasn't mastered an anti-aging spell yet, and they wander the halls of Hogwarts looking like the creepy old guy at the club, clearly years older than everyone else, and awkwardly out of place.

Meanwhile, Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), the pseudo-albino antagonist, is busy growing up into someone who looks like a Die Hard villain; which is ironic considering Professor Snape is played by Alan Rickman, a man who was the original Die Hard enemy for John McClane.  Add David Thewlis as Professor Lupin and the evil Euro-trifecta is complete.

Still battling the legacy of Voldermort is the key issue, with a few of his lackeys - most notably Helena Bonham Carter looking horrible - taking people away, killing others, and causing havoc.  There are also several fanciful potions and concoctions throughout, as Harry, Ron, and Dumbledore end up with reactions similar to the side affects of LSD, Ecstasy, and Meth, respectively.  Both are only minimal side stories, however, because the main point is to introduce drama and relationships into this edition, and inexplicably make a cute blonde like that red-headed train-wreck Ronald, not to mention Hermione's baffling attraction to him.  Too much of the plot was sacrificed, and too many holes are filled in by teen romance.

This is by far the worst of the Harry Potter series.  There are some great sci-fi scenes, wonderful special effects, competent acting, and some incredibly dark imagery.  It's a joy to watch most of the time, but some aspects of the plot are ridiculously lacking (e.g. Dumbledore can turn back time, but nobody can stop a fire?).  Additionally the kids, scratch that, adults, shouldn't be in Hogwarts anymore; they're a little long in the tooth.  Harry and his sycophants should be serving as adjunct faculty at this point, not taking ""Advanced Potions.""  Setting up another in the Harry Potter 90210 series - with obvious cameos for Brandon and Brenda Walsh - the movie ends on a down-note, with a huge spoiler (not for anyone who has heard countless rumors on the internet), and the first incomplete, and completely unsatisfying, ending in the Harry Potter series.",1248566400,7,2824,5.038709677419355
3041648,5,B000ZECQ08,"Out of all the Harry Potter films so far, Half-Blood Prince is my favorite. Why? Well, for one, it is a brilliantly well done film that once again allows the amazing acting to really shine through, and it also throws in subtle references to the previous films in the series as well as different pieces of plot from the books. Half-Blood Prince has it all: humor, style, flawless special effects, great acting, and a plot that is more powerful than any plot told in the films to date.

The villains are especially impressive, and they give performances that are absolutely memorable and chilling all at once. The teenage angst presented by our lovable protagonists is relatable and just as interesting to watch as the cool fight scenes are. Yes, this Potter film does it all in a way that will dazzle, amaze, and astound you.

This film takes place directly after Order of the Phoenix left off, with good 'ole Harry still recovering from his battle with Lord Voldemort. However, he is called back by Albus Dumbledore to aid in a mission to find out more about Voldemort's dark past and to try to stop the evil from becoming as powerful as it had been years ago. Trust me, by the end of the movie, your heart will be wrenched with emotions and your jaw will be slammed through the floorboards. It's really that good.

Everything from the editing to the special effects were done well, and done in a way so that they make you feel exactly what the director had intended you to feel. There are even some pretty jarring thrills sprinkled in with the happy-go-lucky moments and sweet smiles that the film will give you, plus it's laugh out loud funny and jump out of your seat terrifying all at once. This truly is a film for the ages.

The special effects, an area that has really bothered me in previous Potter films, have really been improved with this installment. The use of CGI is even less so than it was in the films prior to Half-Blood Prince, which is a god-send, and the CGI that is used doesn't look as ugly and is rarely the main focus of the screen. The characters become more fleshed out and the stage is set for the grand finale that we will experience within the next couple of years.

Without a doubt, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a film EVERYONE has to see. It has everything you'd want and expect from a Potter film plus it's simply a classic film all together. Potter fans will love it and movie buffs in general will be in awe by the time the ending credits roll. Trust me, you won't regret seeing this one.",1248480000,4,2536,4.468682505399568

3041651,2,B000ZECQ08,"This is exactly the kind of movie that concisely conveys what sort of generation we are raising - overweight, insipid, listless, boring, directionless, and dull. All those expletives still do not do full justice to the abject uselessness that is this film - one that meanders through scene after scene of some of the worst dialog you've ever heard - and the 'performances' are merely afterthoughts. Consider this a lab experiment gone wrong and all the mice are dead. Yet as a viewer, I bravely soldiered on, half-expecting the movie to raise its' bar and 'take off', so to speak. Unfortunately, this never quite happened.

Prime fault lies with the director and the uninspired performances by all the leads - but really, there is only so much they could do with such an over-the-top storyline that gives fantasy fiction a bad name. This wasn't the weakest story in the cannon - in fact, Lord Voldemorts' origins were explained here (in possibly the most interesting segments), and it also does contain Dumbledore's death - which came and went in the space of one minute (even less, I think). Considering the film kills off a major character, it seemed unusual that this was almost clinically filmed, with no interest in actual emotion or depth. A huge failure, all things considered.

The need to portray the children here as 'grown up' was most vile, with hideous love triangles that would test the patience of even an infatuated adolescent. For the rest of us, it was more proof that the series has far outstayed its' welcome, considering that past parts, such as 'Azakaban', were so dark, gothic and beautifully directed. This one is soulless and tepid - and by the time the endless Quidditch matches come your way, its clearly a case of one too many. Daniel Radcliffe sleepwalks throughout the entire proceedings in a performance that can only be called 'mind-numbing'. The same can be said of poor Maggie Smith who looked utterly bored with everything.

Gigantic plotholes seem to permeate the Harry Potter landscape. For example, everytime Hogwarts is under threat by 'dark forces', the combat strategy is to send everyone to bed. ""Off to your rooms, children!"" certainly can't work here, could it? But still, this is what they do. Also, Dumbledore can apparently travel at will to any part of the world in a split second, but at the end of the movie, he is trapped in a cave with Harry, and they use a good half hour of the films time to move from one end of the cave to the other using a boat that they manually pull out of the water. Ridiculous.

That said, it bears reminding that this is a childrens' film, and thus, expectations can never be too high. For what its worth, the first three or four Potter films were enjoyable and had its' moment in the sun. The deja vu you feel while watching this is inescapable, and this is the first Potter movie adaptation where nothing will make sense if you haven't read the book first. The final scenes which consist of Ron, Hermione and Harry gazing at the sky is meant to be 'breathtaking' but it only angers you as they come up with the most repugnant script to accompany this segment - everything is a mismatch, things aren't explained properly, and all of a sudden, the movie ends.

Two Generous Stars. How this made it past the editing table is beyond me.",1248393600,14,3313,4.685567010309279

He needs him to visit some one, an old teacher.  Dumbledore wants him to teach but the teacher always says no.  After Harry talking to him by himself (Dumbledore goes to the bathroom) the teacher still says no.  Then though he decides to do it.  So, now Hogwarts has a new teacher.  The teacher knew Voldemort when he attended Hogwarts.  Harry finds this out when Dumbledore takes a vile with a memory of his and dumps it in some water.  Harry puts his face in and sees the memory.  Dumbledore though, says it is a false memory.  He asks Harry to find out more about the teacher.

So much so that even Hermione can't keep up.  So, Harry tries to figure out who the Half Blood Prince was.  Turns out that it may be a teacher that is at Hogwarts.  One which Harry may not get along with.  So, this person in with whom Harry can't talk to may be helping him out.

Another part of the story, which ads humor, is the romance.  Ron has a girl who likes him very much.  Hermione may have a problem with this girl.  Ron keeps things going with her, always telling Harry about things they do together.  Poor Hermione is there as well.  She gets a little stressed and emotional when she hears him talking.  Something happens to Ron.  He is asleep in the hospital.  Harry and Hermione are standing by his side as well as some others and the girlfriend shows up.  After Hermione and her share some words they hear Ron saying something.  I will not say what it is.  But the girlfriend leaves.  Angry and hurt.  While Hermione remains, with a little added happiness.  Also, Harry starts to see Genie as something he could like.  She already seems to feel this way about harry.  So, what will happen with the two couples of friends?

Then, there is something strange.  Something that is given to a student.  By someone Harry and his friends know.  Malfoy!  The item is a necklace.  When the girl it is given to touches it, she almost dies.  They are able to save her, but she can not remember who gave her the necklace.  Harry figures it out.  Dumbledore tells Harry that the item given to the girl is something very dangerous.  Turns out that the item has something to do with the memory that the teacher has.  The one Harry viewed in which Dumbledore told him was a false memory.  Harry has to convince the new teacher to let him see the real memory.  He does so and finds out that the necklace was a horcrux.  An item that lets someone break their should into parts.  Each part is out into an item and hidden.  Turns out Voldemort has do this.  Seven times!  Harry and Dumbledore decide that they have to find them.  For if they do it will help with the defeat of Voldemort.  Harry and Dumbledore find a place that has one of the pieces of soul.  They go to get it.  Before they do, Dumbledore tells Harry that he must listen to everything he says.  If he says run, run.  If he says leave him their, leave him their.  If Dumbledore screams in pain to stop, then Harry must force him to continue.  Well, something big happens.  I don't want to give it away though, so you will have to watch and see.

In then end Harry tells Ron and Hermione that he cannot go back to school.  He has to find the Horcrux that Dumbledore and he started looking for.  Hermione tells him that sometimes, though brave, can be thick.  She tells him that they will all three go and look.  Thus the movie ends.  The movie flew by.  It was more serious than any of the Potter movies.  In my opinion that is.  You really feel like you have been there with them through it all.  They do a great job of making the characters feel like they grow with you.  It was all great and I can't wait to buy the DVD.",1248307200,,3980,4.277027027027027
3041653,5,B000ZECQ08,"I've read the book and listened to the Stephen Fry narrated audio version.  Films are not meant to duplicate the literal experience of the novel.  This film stunningly succeeds in avoiding that trap.  Whenever it can tell the story visually and artistically rather than through dialogue and linear plotting, it does so.  Its visual style reminds me of Cocteau's ""Beauty and the Beast"", Gilliam's ""Brazil"" and Bergmann's ""The Seventh Seal"". Mesmerizing from the first surreal opening reel to the end, this is every bit deserving of its current box office success.  Harry Potter and friends now live in a world which Lord Voldemort has insidiously penetrated at every level.  Both the magical and mortal worlds are on the verge of collapse.  Harry with Dumbledore's assistance must find the way to defeat Voldemort.  As they explore one memory after another, they discover that Voldemort has split his soul into other, hidden portions and Harry will have to find and destroy each soul.  The scenes  of magic, evil, delving into memories and battles make you feel as if you are there in that other, magical realm.  Dark, foreboding, stunning.

3041654,1,B000ZECQ08,"Because this movie was not the Half Blood Prince by any stretch of the imagination. I have read repeated reviews giving this film 5 stars or A+ ratings and it's ridiculous. 2 stars, even 3, or a C rating I could possibly stomach, but this movie totally butchered the story. They should have just changed the title altogether and not messed up a good thing.

I think that some people feel that the book fans do not like the film because it's not exactly like the original story.  Not liking this film has nothing to do with fans of the story wanting an exact replica on the screen. Would that have been awesome?  Yes, but not expected. I have never expected the movie's to cover every detail of the books, but the important scenes should be included.  That being said, adding in unnecessary scenes that were not in the book is a waste of time. It detracted time from the end battle and the funeral that should have taken place because they are extremely significant to the story. Too much romance and not enough of the noteworthy, serious, or dark points were covered.

I did enjoy the performance of a number of the actors but I can imagine the non-book readers could have left feeling very confused by the lack of information given in this film. I think the reason these movies do so well in the theaters is the fans of the books know the story is over and the movies are nostalgic for them, despite how badly they are often handled. It is a shame that almost all the heart we grew to love from the books was lost in the film.

I could not recommend this movie to a book fan or a newcomer who hasn't read the books, neither one would be satisfied. If you only want to focus on special effects and romance then I am sure you will like the film much better than I did.",1248134400,24,1767,4.307228915662651

I am crushed because despite the anger I have I liked the move but I am crushed because I also hated it!  The story is supposed to be about Voldemort (and the mystery of the half-blood prince), getting harry prepared to face things, in one of these ways letting him get to know his enemy and his origins through memories (the relationships between characters is important  just not as important to the story as EVERYTHING they left out!, and other relationships Harry forms are important too but these characters such as dobby never really appear in the movies after they are introduced in one of them...)The director that did this movie is a MORON, and they should be forced to film all the missing story gaps and a few more memories and re-release the movie and if not that at least film all of the stuff and extend the movie on blu-ray by at LEAST 30 minutes!

I hate that they cut out the battle at the end of the book too, oh yea we'll just strut out  of the castle...

I do not recommend it if you require a plot that makes sense or some mental depth to the script.

3041657,3,B000ZECQ08,"And that quote very neatly sums up the entire movie, HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE. And it's not the boy Wizard and his friends who carry the film on their shoulders. It's three great British actors who do more with their roles than the script ever manages to suggest: namely--JIM BROADBENT, with his hilarious quizzical expression as Professor Slughorn, ALAN RICKMAN as Snapes, seething with intensity no matter how trite his lines are, and MICHAEL GAMBON as Dumbledore, urging Harry to fight the evil forces engulfing Hogwarts.

On a much more superficial level, we have the three young stars giving their usual bland performances as students dealing with raging hormones as well as wizardry--DANIEL RADCLIFFE in his most colorless Potter role to date, EMMA WATSON and RUPERT GRINT. They do furnish the only lighter moments in a film dedicated to the dark side, complete with low-key lighting for all the interior shots and murky skies full of Death Eaters and such.

Technically, all the usual care has gone into creating the dark fantasy world of J.K. Rowling and the background score by Nicholas Hooper adds dimension to the film's many dark moods and action moments.

My impression was that very little seemed to be happening in the way of story development for the first hour-and-a-half with attention drawn more to the love potion moods of the youngsters distracted from their studies by puppy love. RUPERT GRINT, in particular, had some very amusing moments in this vein.

But the overall feeling is that this is simply going over ground already covered in previous Potter outings without any really significant new developments or feats of wizardry we expect in these sort of stories. Not having read the book, I can only say that there was a certain lack of focus on story ingredients that made me think I was missing something.

Nor was it helpful that Radcliffe, Grint and Watson did not have the clear enunciation of the above-mentioned trio of British gentlemen who really carried the film. Their diction was impeccable compared to the young stars who made their lines indistinct at times.

While I've enjoyed the 5th movie a bit more with each viewing, and probably will for the 6th as well, I do not like this director's (same guy for the 5th and 6th movies and, unfortunately, for the remaining two films) handling of the story.  One more thing I haven't seen addressed, unless I missed it--the absolutely horrible music in the 5th and 6th movies by Nicholas Hooper (who most likely will also do the remaining two films)--completely unmemorable, bland, generic movie music, unlike the music of his two predecessors, John Williams and Patrick Doyle, who both contributed outstanding scores.  As a musician myself, I feel the score adds so much to the movie.  This guy missed the boat completely.  What a shame.",1248048000,14,965,4.895705521472393
3041660,1,B000ZECQ08,"First let me start by saying I have NOT read the books so I am not disappointed in any changes from the books. I come to this movie strictly as a movie-lover and expecting another fun Harry Potter movie. I have never been so disappointed and let down in a film where my expectations were not overly exaggerated. This movie was boring, bland, overly hormone-charged, and had hardly any substance what-so-ever. Relationships are awkward, the main three don't seem to have normal interactions, the ending is abrupt, characters randomly show up on camera and then they're gone, things are introduced oddly and seem important and then seemingly forgotten (i.e., Draco's cane and the bugs that ""make your mind fuzzy""), the feelings Harry has for Ginny seemed to have come out of nowhere since the last film and the attraction between Harry and Cho, scenes seem tossed together and the movie as a whole does not flow very well. The lack of emotion is very evident when a certain main character dies. And the way that person dies is quite abrupt and shows Harry as a huge wimp and completely unprepared for what I expect is coming in the next chapter. There are a LOT of things that are not explained in this movie and by a lot I mean I was lost left and right in this movie. I had to talk with people who have read the books to help understand what was not explained but having spoken with them they are much more disappointed than me. The differences they explained from the book to the movie is so great that even I'm questioning how they can make up for it in the final chapter and fix things that truly contradict the story. But like I said, I came to this from strictly a movie-lover's perspective and not knowing if things were changed or omitted. Even still, this is a very, very disappointing movie.

**UPDATE**
I have now read the book and must say the movie actually seems to do a very good job of the book. I was too upset to not be behind a 5-star rating that I had to read the book. Yes, many parts are left out and many really pointless things are added or changed but for the most part this movie did well in my opinion of sticking with the book.

However, I feel because of the things added, the HUGE battle left out, not explaining, at least in part, the break-up between Harry and Cho between the last movie and this one that the movie was still poorly, poorly done. Every other movie alone does well telling a story, flows well with the other movies, and does not require prior knowledge of it's audience but this one almost certainly does. This movie almost seems to have been directed by someone totally different though.

Even in the book there is not much desire to figure out who the Half-Blood Prince is so the movie was not mistaken here. Also, the book also shows a lot of ""hard feelings"" between the main three and not much interaction as a group so the movie showed that well (but doesn't explain it as well as the book [can't believe I'm saying that]). Also, the Wrackspurts, which make your brain go fuzzy, were also only mentioned in the beginning of the book so the movie isn't off here either. However, on that point, that is followed up by Luna's belief about the Auror's later at Slughorn's party which I don't remember in the movie. If it was there it would help paint a better picture of Luna's character and beliefs but if it wasn't then the part about the Wrackspurts seems pointless still.

The funeral, perhaps can be used to start the next movie off in a sad, sombering way to help set things up as it appears there will be no time at Hogwarts and things will start soon after the ending we just saw. Disappointing to not see, but okay with me for now.

So, I no longer believe we are in trouble when it comes to the next films because I do not see how things are too immeasurable to overcome. HOWEVER, unlike the previous movies or any other sequel of any sort that I've seen, this movie is still mostly boring, mostly anti-climactic, confusing from the previous movie (Harry and Cho relationship mostly), and just filled with too much fluff. There's bound to be changes from the book, but there were too many unneccessary additions. Not only did it drag this out (which no doubt adds to the bored sensation), it added to confusion to the audience as to the purpose (i.e., the waitress in the beginning, Draco's cane, and the multiple times we see Draco at the closet).

I would love to increase my star rating, but like I said before, as a pure movie-lover's take on this, this was not higher than a low 3-star movie. But, I will still purchase the movie on DVD when it comes out to continue my collection and hope that it grows on me.",1248048000,31,4673,4.434225844004657
3041661,3,B000ZECQ08,"I have a confession to make: I am 40-something years old, and I love the Harry Potter series. Well, not much of a confession, is it? In fact, as I looked around in the theater arena at the other patrons of this newly-released ""young adult"" blockbuster film, I noticed that the vast majority of them were at least my age and many older than me. And they did NOT have children with them. This alone speaks to the universality of theme that I had recognized myself long ago within the pages of this compelling story. It isn't just for children after all. Beyond any questions of the red herring of ""witchcraft,"" I have found this series to contain quintessential good vs. evil struggles that are presented in realistic fashion, that is, that the players are human (well, roughly anyway) and everyone has deep motivation and logic behind his or her actions. The tale is an expertly woven one. In the book, that is.

I am lucky that I went into the viewing of this film having read the book first, although it has been a few years since I picked it up. Amazingly, the plot points and fabric floated back to me as if I had only just read it. After all, the Half-Blood Prince is my favorite character and this 6th volume my favorite book in the series.  So, why then is there only a tentative thread of curiosity into who the Half-Blood Prince is? I found the dramatic intensity of the books' scenes dampened here and in other ways. I have heard other reviewers call the film ""leisurely"" and harp about all the snogging that goes on. Sure, there is snogging in the book, but there is so much more. I figure we could have done with some of the backstory of the Prince's early life to tie the reminscences of Horace Slughorn for his star pupil Lily Evans together in a suggestive way that would give us more insight into what was going on. Perhaps cut off one of the many, MANY shots of Malfoy looking serious, Malfoy looking worried, Malfoy looking distraught...well, you get the idea.

For all that, I found the snogging scenes pretty well done and Lavender Brown suitably overblown and awful, complete with her purring of ""Won Won"" to a horrified Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint played the man in the lovers' snare to perfection here). Hermione, too, was real ""heart on your sleeve"" when it came to the lovers' game as well and her unwanted suitor McClaggen was pretty good, but I think Lavender takes the cake. Both Grint and Watson were the picture of young, complicated, emotional ""love."") Radcliffe's Potter, however, seemed rather preoccupied and I got none of the feeling that he wanted to pummel Ginny's suitors into the earth as noted in the book. I can see, however, why this is downplayed, since Harry has so much more to worry about. Potter stands upon a knife-edge at this point, and I think Radcliffe played it passing well, coming off as somewhat overwhelmed but well over his own adolescent sufferings as seen in ""Order of the Phoenix.""

Many of the plot points were condensed or modified to tell a leaner story; for instance, Malfoy's grand scheme with the vanishing cabinets entails a mass invasion by many Death Eaters in the book. All the Order of the Phoenix members are fighting in the halls and up the stairs to the Astronomy Tower. In the movie, there are only four people, and it is a quiet, personal affair. No one knows what happened until it is all over. The denouement in the Astronomy Tower seems somehow constricted, like it is even physically blocked by the set itself without the clear, circular space from the book; the good, weakened, facing the bad, in great numbers, waiting for Malfoy to perform. Only when Snape steps in finally does the scene converge with memory. Overall, I got the feeling of an ill-blocked scene, as Harry was completely out of the place I envisioned from the setup in the book. In print it was compelling, thrilling, with the Dark Mark over Hogwarts seen from Hogsmeade, urging our heroes to respond to Malfoy's action. In the movie, all this is blurred and the Dark Mark appears only after all is said and done, as if it is a dramatic recapitulation rather than mad melee challenge. In the end, the quiet tone works well enough, the intimate coup, rather than the overrunning of noisy and haphazard Dark Wizards. It must have been easier to follow for those who have not read the book.

I did feel that there was not enough staff consternation and reaction to the shocking role of Professor Snape, and his final interaction with Harry was also somewhat muffled, the dramatic intensity lessened from the breathless narrative in the book. But, perhaps those of you who are aficionados of the movies without the influence of the books will find this review to be somewhat annoying (uh oh, it's another one of those ""it's not as good as the books"" reviews!). But the movie does have its own sort of internal consistency, and there are suggestive hints dropped throughout that will mean something to those who have read the books but will pass unnoticed to those who haven't.

For instance, after Harry drinks the Felix Felicis potion and goes out the Gryffindor House portal to find Professor Slughorn, he says ""Hi!"" to someone he must have run into. In the book, Harry has bumped between Ginny and Dean Thomas and precipitated the breakup fight that will magically free up Ginny to become HIS girl in the end. Felicity, indeed! But that can't be told in a movie the way it can be told in print. Slughorn's recruitment by Dumbledore and Harry is also diluted by throwing out Harry's show of persuasive power for a less compelling motivation (""he wants to collect you, Harry"".) Another is the very short appearance of Regulus Black (his photo, anyway), Sirius' brother, in a picture of Slughorn's that he is showing to Harry at the beginning. ""I'd have liked to have the set,"" he opines. What this means is lost on the audience, unless they know that Slughorn was the Master of Slytherin House in his days at Hogwarts, and he ""had"" Regulus but didn't have Sirius. This is because Sirius is in Gryffindor House, which might explain his Gryffindor friends, mightn't it? And watch for more on Regulus later, in the next thrilling installment.

Anyway, overall, I found the movie enjoyable, except that, of course, it didn't focus quite so much on the second titular character. I did find enough to keep it together though; the underflow text that begins with Snape's vow with Narcissa and Bellatrix at the beginning is suggested throughout, even if it is often with one of rather too many meaningful glam shots of Malfoy looking put out. (Speaking of Malfoy, it looks as if Tom Felton has grown up rather too quickly; Malfoy looks like a cutthroat corporate exec already. I guess we could put it down to the stresses placed on him in this story. After all, this is really the first time the younger Malfoy gets to be part of the real meat of the story. (The elder Malfoy is only seen in various newspaper clippings that suggest not only disgrace but incarceration and general disfavor. Bad luck, Lucius!) Another shady, unexplained character is Fenrir Grayback, who is seen with Malfoy and Bellatrix several times and is part of the invading party, but somehow we're never let in on the fact that he's a werewolf, and what's more, that he's the very one who turned Remus Lupin into a werewolf when he was but 5 years old. And to top it all off, he's rather ""into"" turning young kids into werewolves. That would have added quite a lot of tension and thrill to the scene where he is pursuing Harry and Ginny outside the Weasley House (which I don't recall having burned down in the book.) One thing that seems to have fallen out ok, though, is the sense that Voldemort is everywhere but here. We are shown young Tom Riddle, whose portrayal by two young actors at different ages comes off as polite evil about to hatch out well enough. The shots of the ring on young Tom's hand and then in Dumbledore's office later is suggestive enough, but these books are becoming more complex as we reach the denouement, and I hardly think a single movie of just over 2-1/2 hours can encompass it all. It is no wonder the last installment has been split into two, or else it might end up as a series of blip images that mean something only to people like me who have devoured the books a few times each.

Ok, so this isn't a tidy review, but perhaps you get the idea from it that it is a passably good film that has tidbits hidden in it that are only revealed properly if you've read the books. I must end up saying yes, the book is better than the movie, but, in the end, this is a feature of the medium. Books have all the time in the world to tell a detailed story, and the quickness of its telling is determined only by how fast you wish to turn the pages. I grow more and more to feel that the Harry Potter series is diminished if one only knows the films but they are still quite enjoyable as far as summer blockbusters go. Just prepare to be confused by many of the unexplained images and stuff that was left out in the translation of book to film.",1247961600,15,9080,4.556031843233313
3041662,2,B000ZECQ08,"They left too much out. Period. And their editing sucks because movies aren't supposed to *feel* too long. I haven't read the book and I watched this thing drag on and on and felt bored. Bored! There is this incredible world of magic, brought to life with dazzling special effects, great costumes, compelling characters and actors with genuine chemistry. And so yeah there IS that! So thumbs-up on all that! But it was like watching half of a story unfold with crucial information and contexts edited out to make room for teenage drama. It is exactly like hearing a great story but you missed a few crucial parts and so it falls flat, and the person telling the story isn't a great story teller...And it reminds of somebody who is, in this case of Harry Potter, Alfonso Cuarn who made the most cinematic film of the series. Yes the movie version must necessarily leave out somethings, but it is the job of the writer and director to get what is essential in there while not bogging things heavily down too much. Since David Yates was chosen to do the last book, I hold out little hope, but at least they did the smart thing, giving that book two movies. Maybe that will save the day?
I guess they think everybody has read the books, but that seems like it would make it worse for those that have. You know every detail that skipped!

I really have enjoyed the *film* series. I'm not a reader of the books, which undoubtedly strikes you as absurd and wrong (so I'm already aware you probably strongly feel that way, so spare me. I do read books.)
The director and screen writers have dragged this adventure series down and zapped it of it's excitement. It is NOT because the books are darker. If anything ""darker"" should mean better.",1247961600,6,1732,4.533546325878595
3041663,3,B000ZECQ08,"And so we all go now, like zombies drawn to raw flesh, or lemmings to the sea, to watch this latest intallment of the Harry Potter Franchise.

So, why do people go in droves to see the Harry Potter movies?  Well, clearly I belong to the category of adults who have never read the books and were drawn in by their children, who did read the books.

And at the end of it all, the only things that are clear to me about the success of the Harry Potter books and movies are:

1. Their fascination for pre-pubescent children has always been in the fact that this is a tale of children, empowered by magic and living in a fantastical world, and able to show their stuff and prove their worth to the adults around them.

2. The series mixes a complex fantasy world with brief interactions with the real world.  Which does create some gigantic plot holes, but it is also, I think one of the attractions of the movie series - that these are modern day British children and teenagers, easy to relate to, and living halfway in the real world, and halfway in this fantasy world.

3. Somehow or another, ""Harry Potter"" managed to stand out enough from the crowd initially to become a Big Success as a book with its core audience of pre-pubescent children.  As everybody piled on top of this success, the first movie ""Sorcerer's Stone"" (""Philosopher's Stone"" outside of the U.S.) also became a resounding success.  Key to this was the casting and the careful shepharding of the storyline, and careful craftsmanship of the movie itself.  Turning a children's fantasy story into a movie goldmine is hardly automatic -as ""Golden Compass"" and ""Inkheart"" have shown.

For me, one of the most pleasant aspects of slogging through all of these Harry Potter movies has been following the growth of the real-life actors and actresses on screen.  I think that this has been one of the main reasons for the success of Harry Potter the Franchise - the initial selection of such a group of healthy, wholesome, and really neat kids to play these characters.  Their natural likeability and talent has always come right out onto the screen, which has not been the case for other child actors (e.g., Jake Lloyd -young Anakin Skywalker, Dakota Richards - ""Golden Compass"").

One wonders what would have happened if Terry Gilliam had been made the director of the first Harry Potter movie (as J.K. Rowling wanted), if the movie series would have developed a more sly and twisted sensibility than what it has become.  I would have loved to see that.

For the movie series has evolved into a well-crafted but ponderous vehicle for decent entertainment.  The book series that it draws from was never as well constructed or well written as a fantasy world in the class of Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"".  And thus the movies reveal their uneven, plot-holed origins from the book.

This particular movie especially required a guidebook, as in nearly every scene, stuff just happened that was never explained.  Of all the Harry Potter movies, this one had the least amount of exposition to it, a pity, since this section deals with the Origin of Voldemort.  I had my daughter with me, who helped explain parts of the movie.

Viewers without a guide, who have never watched a previous Potter movie, and who have never read the book series, would almost certainly be left  completely clueless by the goings on in this movie.",1247961600,6,3382,4.685279187817259
3041664,4,B000ZECQ08,"Briefly, this latest rendition of the Harry Potter saga was quite well done, an above average of the series and could possibly be the best so far.

Not only was it a darker, richer story, but the scriptwriters were surgically precise in cutting out of Rowling's book all the fat and leaving the meat.

They cut out the Dursely's (SP), which is fine with me. Off with the Minister of Magic, including Fudge and his replacement. Away with many of the Tom Riddle memories that were expounded in the book. No Snape detention sentences. No Dobby!

And that's OK. What was left?

Teenage angst in the form of loves lost, loves gained and love POTION! The film concentrated on personalities for the most part and the fun and excitement of Quidditch (kinda like wizard soccer).

The acting was not overdone, but in many ways subdued with was a point of contention with me. Also the ending was much subdued than the book. The book's exciting battle of Hogwarts and the confrontation with Snape and Harry were extremely suppressed to a minor ten minutes. Damn few wizard battles though the attack on London by the dark wizards was fascinating.

The Pensieve and the whole memories smoke thing was intriguing but new viewers who have not read the books may not totally follow.

We're rooting for Harry, Slughorn and wondering about who the Half-Blood Prince is (which revelation was much better done in the book). A character dies, a chapter closes, and hints for the next segment make you want more.

And the soundtrack score at the credits is to die for.

Highly Recommended.

3041665,2,B000ZECQ08,I was very depressed when I saw this movie.  It was absolutely nothing like the book which really sucked.  My kids liked it though but they haven't read any of the books.,1247961600,9,170,4.28125
3041666,3,B000ZECQ08,"I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter series and I think they have done a great job with the movies so far, however I always think the book version is better than any movie version.  I went to see this with two people who had not read the book so I was interested to see how well were able to understand what was going on without the background.  I also re-read the book a couple of weeks ago to refresh my own memory.

A few observations:

- I was disappointed that they started the movie off with a scene that never happened in the book; Harry in a cafe.
- I had been waiting to see how they handled the meeting and conversation between the Muggle prime minister and the minister of Magic but they skipped that part completely.
- the movie Harry never really mentioned Dumbledore's hand and neither did anyone else for that matter.  In the book it was a matter of gossip among all of the students.
- they skipped the first memory that explained Tom Riddle's witch mother and muggle father, how poor and proud they were and the significance of the both the ring and the locket.
- they skipped later memories that explained how Tom Riddle ended up with the ring and the locket.
- Bill and Fleur were both completely missing
- Dobby and Kreacher were both completely missing
- The battle at Hogwarts when the Death Eaters came in was missing
- they left out the whole funeral scene where everyone came to see Dumbledore off; even the mermaid people showed their respect.
- I have no idea why they stuck in the scene where Harry and Ginny were running through the cornfield and Bella burned the Burrows.  That did not happen in the book; in fact the Burrows was well protected.

To me these are some of the important scenes that were left out.  My friends had a hard time understanding what was going on.  I am glad I re read the book recently or I might have had a bit of trouble following it since they seemed to leave so much out.

On the other hand the special effects were great and I have to give credit, coming up with all of the creative things that JK Rowling comes up with for the books has got to be a challenge.

I think the actors all did a pretty good job.  The actor playing Malfoy did a fine job of showing his angst about the job he had to do however the whole story about the two vanishing cabinets being connected was fuzzy.  They did a great job on the scene where Harry finally got the memory from Slughorn but then they followed it pretty closely from the book.  I loved how positive and upbeat Harry was after he had drank the liquid luck.

I gave this three stars because they left so much that was vital out and added a couple of things that were completely unnecessary.  There was much to like however.  I think this movie would have been better if they had made it in two parts as they are planning to do with the last one.  Books 5, 6 & 7 just have so much information that one 2 hour+ movie simply cannot do them justice.",1247875200,31,2946,4.221033868092691
3041667,4,B000ZECQ08,"The sixth installment in the Harry Potter film series, HALF-BLOOD PRINCE, has its moments.  Indeed, there are twists and turns and plenty of romance galore that are threefold.  Consisting first and foremost, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) continues his wizardly quest for good over evil despite the ever-menacing spirit of Lord Voldemort, which left movie viewer's gasping during the ORDER OF THE PHOENIX, second, Harry as possible candidate under the tutelage of Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon)to become his successor, and third, the hyper-sensitive hormones that Harry and his peers, Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) simply cannot escape as part of their stage of adolescence.

The film appears much darker than the previous two and breaths similarities to the cinematography of a LORD OF THE RINGS or Tim Burton film and other epic renderings that have had a medieval-like quality depicting heroism and myth.  With that in mind, there are high and low points of the film that avid Harry Potter movie fans may notice.  Indeed, the lighter moments are exhibited with the giggly somewhat sappy scenes that show new Hogwart's Professor Horace Slughorn concocting magical love potions that get the wizards abuzz.  Ron experiences his first romantic encounter with Gryffindor student, Lavender Brown (Jesse Cave) while at the same time Hermione appears to have a crush on Ron that has her feeling a little left out; Harry is also game with Ron's sister, Ginney (Bonney Wright).  But there are scenes and characters in the film that simply did not have enough of an impact and attempted to put a bit of a punch within the film, such as the conflicting scenes with Professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) and Harry as well as the presence of femme fatale Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham) who looked like something out of Edward Scissorhands with her gothic persona, and the mystery surrounding the Half-Blood Prince and looming suspicions of Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton).  But film-goers will no doubt be looking for the concluding climax of the film that did not appear unpredictable, especially for readers.

For the most part, HALF-BLOOD PRINCE was highly entertaining and clich.  Harry Potter fans will flock to see the film as they see the intensity of the scenes but may also leave one either empty handed or hungry for the next installment.  The film is indeed filled with a mix of emotions and love potions thus earning 3.5 stars.",1247875200,2,2445,5.102756892230577
3041668,5,B000ZECQ08,"Just watched the newest screening. It's amazing. The art direction is stellar, and the story is executed very well. The love stories are nicely fit in. the action is extremely good, though the action in Goblet of Fire is yet to beaten.
Daniel Radcliffe has improved very much, and is not the douche bag he was in ORDER OF THE PHOENIX. In fact, he is the heart if the film. Micheal Gambon is the DUMBLEDORE we wanted in this film. Grint as RON is amazing, and we get to see how he gets rid of his predicament-in the form of Lavender Brown- amusingly. Emma Watson is better than Grint, and her performance is top-notch. She's also extremely gorgeous (I'm 15, I'm allowed to say that).
But the real scene-stealer is Rickman as Snape. He's awesome, and no one else can be Snape. This is MR. Alan's breakthrough performance.
The rest of the actors are magnificent, while Helena B. Carter and Maggie Smith shine. The only complaint is the girl who plays Lavender Brown. She plays her finely, but I hate her character. I guess she did a good job, then.
Bonnie Wright is really good (in acting, she needs to look better like Emma).
The art direction and effects are, as always, incredible.
It surpassed my expectations. As good as Goblet of Fire!

3041669,2,B000ZECQ08,"Here, Potter is shut in a darkened room and tortured by boredom until his backside went to sleep and went painfully numb. Hold on a second, no, that was me. Hells bloody bells, having never read the books and seeing all of the films, this is bogging down into a battle of attrition, much like when the X-Files stopped being good and you just had to force yourself to watch it in case something happened. Well, don't worry, nothing did. Oh, some bloke called Stumblebum fell off a big tower and was possibly killed. Or not Wooohooo. My wife who has read the books tells me he was killed. Ho hum. So, ask yourself this.

1) How is the staff at Hogwarts, apparently the hand picked SAS of magic, totally incompetent and always beholden to incompetent students to get them out of the mire.

2) How come Harry Potter, seemingly the ""Ronaldo"" of magic, always gets his arse kicked by every junior wizard, warlock, witch, etc etc he ever comes across. If he is the best the forces of good have to offer, then we are Royaly boogered.

3) How come Stumblebum always starts off with the line ""Harry, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to do something incredibly dangerous etc etc etc"", why doesn't Potter say, ""Booger off, I'm sick of having to clear up your mess, why don't you grow some and sort it out yourself for a change, why on earth has Hogwarts not burned to the ground with an incompetent fool like you in charge, I will never know.""

4) How come when death and disaster reaches out to Hogwarts, the best civil defence planning they can muster is to send everyone to bed? Dame Maggie Smith says in a faux Jocko accent like that women off the Flash adverts years ago, ""Ooch aye children, North Korea has launched a 100 megaton nuclear strike against Hogwarts, noo, please children off to the dormitories with ye before ye warheads vaporize you all, the staff will light a scented candle and hope for the best while Potter sorts it out we hope"".. Give me strength.

4) There is no way on Gods earth that the lurch like ginger one would get within a country mile of any decent chicks, possibly his own sister might be a goer but I would say his parents had already explored that eventuality.

I am reliably told that this film was the one in which nothing happens setting it up for the next one which probably has helicopter gunships in it or something.,..

3041670,4,B000ZECQ08,"|The 8-Month Wait|
At first, when I heard back in November of last year that Harry Potter's 6th chapter would be postponed for 8 months, I was furious.  I blamed Warner Bros for being greedy and wanting more money. 'Shame on them', I thought, for making fans of the movies wait another 8 months... just so they can get a profit.  And, especially, 'shame', for toying with fans of the books, who want to see their favorite story come to life on the screen - especially now that Rowling has finished the Potter tale in such fine form.

As time went by, I changed my mind.  Warner Bros expressed their deep desire to please the fans, and illustrated this by keeping interests peaked and hunger abated using clips from the movie, and photographs from the set of the 'now-in-production 7th Potter movie'.  I reasoned more time meant more opportunities to tweak/improve the sixth film, and make sure patient fans won't be disappointed come July 15th.

|The First Impression|
I've finally seen the film... twice, as of today.  The first time I saw it, I was dismayed. 'Fans of the films might be shocked', I thought, 'that was such a DARK film... gloomy, a drastic shift in the tone for the movie series.  How will movie-fans adjust to this?  And Fans of the books', I feared, 'would be disappointed.  No...not disappointed, FURIOUS!!! Where are the funny scenes with Fudge and the British Prime Minister? Or a heartbroken Tonks and her brown hair and dog-shaped Patronus?  Where are the remaining flashbacks of Voldemort's parents, or his murderous acts as a child, and then as an adult? Or his chilling, almost casual conversation with Dumbledore, man to man?  And what, WHAT happened to the violent duel between the Death Eaters and the Order of the Phoenix?!?  That tense prelude to the tragic climax at the end of the sixth book?!? And WHERE is the FUNERAL scene?!?'

All these thoughts rushed through my mind after seeing the film the first time.  But then, fan of the Potter story that I am, I began to think:  The director for the sixth film, the cast, AND the producer of HP6 ALL gushed about how proud they were of the finished film, and how much they desired to please fans of both the books AND the movies with their work... were they LYING?  Why say all those things, and then show us a film so different from what any fan of the movies OR books would expect?  I decided to give the film a second look, and tried to view it from a different perspective - not as a movie fan, OR as a book fan, but as a critic - a lover of good movies in general.

|A Parting of the Ways|
The result? Satisfaction from every angle. A 2nd viewing of the film gave me a new found respect for David Yates and the work he has done to elevate the quality of the Potter franchise, and please fans and casual viewers alike.  Yes, this Potter is DARK.  Darker I'd say that the last one, and that was a pretty gloomy viewing as well.  But the Potter story was always supposed to BE darker as Harry got older.  Fans of the books will recall the initial shock they felt at Cedric Diggory's death in Book 4, and the horror of 'Flesh, Blood, and Bone', the chapter which chronicled Voldemort's awful return in gruesome detail.  Many readers closed the 4th Potter book with the stunned realization that evil had just successfully come back into the world, and that the fate of the Wizarding world as we know it, was uncertain.  That shock, more than anything, is what kept us reading through Books 5, 6, and 7. This unexpected twist is what Rowling kept utilizing in her books to keep readers on edge - not knowing what could possibly happen next to Harry and his friends that could make things any more worse for the Wizarding world.

Yates has made this intention clear with this film.  Potter's world is NOT the same anymore. No one is safe any longer, and evil has returned and will strike at any time. The sixth book did not feel as ominous and foreboding as the film, but that is the book - I got to see more of Harry's life outside of the menace of Voldemort, a luxury of insight a 3 hour film can only allow so much of.  And Yates does in fact incorporate some of those joyous moments in this film as well, but he makes the viewer aware those joyful moments will be short and sparse, as something terrible is happening in Potter's world, or is about to happen at any moment.  The movie fans must adjust to this change in tone, just as the fans of the books had to adjust from the 4th book up until Book 7 (which incidentally, feels much, MUCH darker in tone than Book 6, for various, necessary reasons.)

And as for fans of the books?  Well, after a 2nd viewing of this film, I feel this sixth movie is sort of like a 'Parting of the Ways' between the book and film versions of Harry Potter.  Rowling has finished the books and ended the story well. Now Yates knows how the story will end, and - since he will be directing all the remaining movies - has complete control over all the elements of Potter's journey that will lead us to the fateful climax in book 7.  Thus, he can now adjust the flow of the story at will, and tweak its development such that fans still get a visual experience of Harry Potter's world, without casual viewers and critics alike being compromised of an entertaining, intriguing film. If Yates simply continued to recreate what fans read in the sixth book, fans of the book would watch the sixth movie and probably be satisfied, but the movie itself, might be too fragmented in its storytelling, and would probably feel too long for casual viewers.  Yates could have aimed more for movie fans and simplified the sixth book's story so they didn't have to work too hard to figure out hints and clues, but Yates doesn't do that either.  Instead, he carefully balances the amount of back-story included in this film... enough to intrigue and entertain viewers without compromising their need to think about what they are seeing.  This is similar to Rowling's style of storytelling.  As fun as it was in each book to 'come back to Hogwarts with Harry', the pleasure of seeing how characters, hints, and clues fit together, how they led to shocking, exciting revelations, added to the experience of each book and always left me eager to read the next book in the Potter saga.

|The Future of Potter|
In a nutshell? A 'Parting of the Ways' - no more sticking too closely to the books, and no more simplifying too much of what's on the screen for casual viewers - in fact, the Critics might just be the new fans to please.  Not an easy pill to swallow (I myself am still adjusting to the taste), but it speaks a lot about Yates' intentions for the Potter movie franchise.  He wants to end the Potter story with a bang, and do it with style, efficiency, and substance.  As someone who loves Rowling's books and knows how a good film can inspire a person to read more literature (Lord of the Rings, I am looking your way), I commend Yates, AND the actors, AND Warner Bros, for their work with this 6th Harry Potter film.  It's a work of art and storytelling, fun and fantasy, dark horror, love, loss, and sadness.  I trusted Rowling to do justice to the Potter story and bring Harry Potter's tale to an exciting and mind-warping conclusion.  She exceeded my expectations.  I think, when all the movies are done and there is nothing left to do but look back, Yates will have done the same for the Potter film franchise, elevating the visualization of the Potter stories into something more substantial, more meaningful to behold, and creating new fans of the movies and books alike.",1247875200,10,7580,4.4847161572052405
3041671,4,B000ZECQ08,"I have enjoyed all six Harry Potter films, but this one ranks among the  very best in my opinion. There wasn't nearly as much action as I expected and I heard that some major scenes were cut (the final battle and a funeral being the major ones), but the characters and story had me captivated for the nearly 2 and 1/2 hour running time. The CGI was convincing and the music score was much better than expected, though I do miss what John Williams did with the first three movies. They should have at least used his epic theme more than the few seconds at the start. There was also plenty of humor to help balance the mood of the film, because this Potter film is very dark.

All the young actors have gotten better and better with each passing movie. I really enjoyed the addition of the new teacher played brilliantly by Jim Broadbent. He made for quite a fascinating character.  It was also a treat to see more of the great Alan Rickman as Snape, but sadly many characters from previous movies are only given a few lines. At least they have kept all the same actors over the years, no matter how small the role.

Overall, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is one of the better films I've seen this year and is worth the time of anyone, no matter your age. Now I'm really looking forward to the two part finale due out in 2010 and 2011.",1247875200,6,1342,4.313492063492063
3041672,2,B000ZECQ08,"JR reviewer gets it right. As adult fans of both HP books and movies this one just missed it by miles. I think we all need to chant loud enough together to shake the earth under Warner's feet....""WE WANT THE BATTLE>>>>WE WANT THE FUNERAL>>>>WE WANT A WEE BIT MORE ACCURACY to the book. But insulting the fans by not including the great battle at the end closer to the books rendition was most unkind. Not just unthoughtful but down right mean and cruel. I was upset many years ago after Chris Columbus first assured he would make all 7 movies and stay as close to the books as was reasonable.... his ""all actors have to be UK born"" rhetoric& promises to both JKR and...the world viewers. Yet when most are 8-12 year olds and as adult fans we too could care less about the MOVIE BIZ perse which CC was really concerned and posturing to back then. But then what happened....by Movie 3...CC was bored stiff and wanted out & somehow he was allowed to distance himself....so what does CC make of this mess. I would like to see JK Rowling herself step up if she has anything to say these days about the let down of this movie to her fans. And also please Ms. Rowling....please if you have influence rights still make sure the next so called two movie episodes will be done to honor the viewers and readers and all YOUR fans alike...do it right Warners. This missed by a mile. What happened? Warner insulted not just the fans of course but Rowling herself.  I debated on giving it only a 1 star. But there were some redeeming parts. The responsible people behind this sad cut needs to be kicked to the curve. Make the movie longer to tell it right if you need to...kids and adult fans alike would agree. Anyone up for a remake of this one? Send your votes to Warners!",1247875200,16,1760,4.382262996941896
3041673,4,B000ZECQ08,"I never thought I would be disappointed by ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" movie adaptation. My expectations were not high. The book is so great it is simply impossible to spoil the movie. Alas, I was mistaken.

It was surprising how unbalanced the plot was. Seems like too much emphasis was put on the romantic relationships. So much so that we completely lost touch with the main theme of battle of good vs evil. Don't get me wrong, I loved Ron/Hermione/Lavender and Harry/Ginny scenes in the book. But in the movie these scenes overshadowed the main event - Dumbledore's death and Snape's seeming betrayal. I remember crying over this scene while reading the book, I remember despising Snape. No luck here. The crucial scenes went by in the movie so fast that I didn't have a chance to feel anything for anybody. At all.

The love between Harry and Ginny never blossomed, there was no chemistry between the actors unfortunately. Slughorn came off as an old whimp. Where was the Order, where were Death Eaters, where was Voldemort? Forget it, instead we got endless fluffy teenage romance scenes.

The only redeeming scenes in the movie belonged to Draco. I felt his moments, although never written, were brilliant. I thought he totally stole this movie.

Overall, the movie was just too light, too long, too anti-climatic and yes, even boring at times. Where were the darkness, the tragedy, the feeling of an impending doom? Sadly, gone...

I would certainly recommend watching this movie, even just for glorious visuals effects. But ultimately, this movie was a disappointment.",1247788800,10,1590,4.962406015037594

After two years of waiting for the sixth installment of the H.P. series, the Warner Corporation presents us with a lame, unsatisfying, boring and highly dissapointing movie. I second all the previous reviews, like the one from J.R. among others, who have appropriately pinpointed the flaws in this ghastly film.  Come on!!  They totally left out (or changed) crucial parts of the book, like the war in Hogwarts against the Death Eaters, Dumbledore's funeral, vital info about the Horcruxes, Tom Riddle's past, etc, etc, etc.  Never mind, I will not repeat what others have already described in such an accurate way about the reasons why I shall only rate this movie with two stars. How frustrating and dissapointing, indeed! They've shattered all my healthy expectations about it. I expected  much better from this film, after all, it is supposed to be based on the excellent written version of the Half Blood Prince.",1247788800,17,923,5.0130718954248366
3041675,4,B000ZECQ08,"As is typical and probably necessary in this day and age of film making, the special effects and CGI are characters in and of themselves in this terrific, but oddly unsatisfying sixth installment in the 'Harry Potter' series.  I enjoyed it immensely, particularly the superb direction, editing, cinematography and musical score.  It was a joy watching the youthful actors make that leap from kidhood to near adulthood, and with those physical changes, the growth in their acting skills.  Ron, Hermoine, Ginny and most particularly, that villain in the wings, Draco, owing to the greater emotional demands of their characters created by J. K. Rowling, brought the necessary acting skills to their near-adult roles.  Tom Felton, for a notable example, was so much more than the snarling, spoiled, petulant antagonist he was in the previous five movies--here he was clearly committed to the nefarious task towards which he had been inculcated and now ordered to commit and yet conflicted and afraid.  Kudos to him and to the screenplay for providing him with some cinematic meat to chew on.

One wonders why, however, essential parts of the book were left either on the cutting room floor or out of the script entirely.  As long as we dive with Harry into the 'penseive,' why not let us see the growth of young Tom Riddle as he becomes Lord Voldemort?  Or the history of Severus Snape?  Of course, a book is not a film is not a book, ad infinitum, and decisions must be made to bring a movie to acceptable and budgetary length.  But in this case, less teenage durm and strang about burgeoining sexuality (as much fun as that was to watch and from which some gentle humor was derived) and more on the depth of the major motives in this plot line would have been greately appreciated.

I am not a little distressed about the director's permitting such rapid speech.  It may be British to swallow syllables, but in a film where dialogue is meant to convey character, it seems to me to be fairly essential that the words be clearly enunciated to be clearly understood.  But that is a distraction, not a glaring fault.

In terms of cinema qua cinema, plot exclusions aside, this was a wonderful movie.  The director's eye is unerringly 'spot-on,' as the Brits would say.  For example, there is a brief scene terrific scene in which Harry is seemingly alone in a long hallway, but the camera spots Draco Malfoy (let's head back to Marlowe's 'Faery Queen' for such names: it means 'bad faith) half hidden by a column, watching and listening, unknown to Harry.  The suggestion, of course, is clear that Harry is under hidden threat and potential danger.  We are given a glimpse into potential action that the main character is not.  Moreover, Draco is quite alone, not parenthesized by his duo of sycophantic bullies.  As the movie evinces clearly enough, Draco has uniquely been selected to carry out Voldemort's orders and in these few seconds, the camera suggests his capacity for genuine evil on the one hand and solitude on the other.

So, the kids are grown and are venturing into grown-up worlds of darkness merely presaged by the five earlier stories.  Rowling's wonderful manipulation of her story lines make for a thrilling sixth episode.  You will enjoy the movie, I am sure, but the die-hard Potter fans will want more.  The real key to the film as it was for the novels is the affection we are drawn to feel for the triumvirate of main characters and their fellows.  'Half Blood Prince' continues to encourage those affections by giving the characters more human substance, foible, and inner strength.  They are not witches and wizards, they are the stuff that reality is made of behind the facade of supernatural shananigan and circumstance.

In fine, can 'Deathly Hallows' (both parts!) be all that far away, where, one hopes, the poignant funeral of Albus Dumbledore would be inserted.  At least we won't have to wait as long between first screenings as we did between 'Phoenix' and 'Prince.'  Will November 2010 come soon enough?  For most Potter fans, based on this latest filmic endeavor into the non-muggle world, probably not.",1247788800,4,4136,4.833806818181818
3041676,4,B000ZECQ08,"Because I've been a fan of various stories, and know that a serious effort at including every detail in a two or three hour movie is impossible, I sat back to enjoy HP and the HBP. I wasn't disappointed. But I've read all the books at least five times. My wife hasn't read them, at all. I filled in a few items for her, which worked out, well. One thing that I did appreciate was the humanization of the characters. One minor flaw that should have been avoided was when Dumbledore and Harry disapparated from inside Hogwarts. This is a direct inconsistency in the oft mentioned ban of apparation inside Hogwarts(which was the whole point regarding the cabinets in the Room of Requirement and Borgin and Burkes.)

3041677,5,B000ZECQ08,"Since I have never seen a Harry Potter film before, nor read any of the books, I had to agree with Harry Potter when he said to Albus Dumbledore: ""...after all these years I just sort of go with it."" I have four nieces and they are all followers of the Potter phenomenon. They had t-shirts made with their own Potter references and slogans, and wore them to the midnight show opening. One of them went down to wait in line at 6 PM so that we could all get good seats. She was the most passionate Potterite among them and had been interviewed at past openings by the local news wearing a Hogwarts uniform.

So it was that I found myself at a midnight show. The crowd was very excited to see the opening, and I was swept up in the excitement, even though I didn't have a clue about the finer points of the J.K. Rowling story. You could say that it wasn't my bailiwick, and I was eminently unqualified to review this movie, but nevertheless, I came, I saw, and I can't resist weighing in with my two cents..

My first observation was that the audience was mostly the same age as the actors playing Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright), Lavender Brown (Jessie Cave), and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), so they had been growing up with them, and were kind of in sync. They were ALL young and feeling love's keen sting, as Professor Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) so aptly put it. In fact there was so much snogging going on, it was hard to fit in the horcruxes, Death Eaters, and the Quidditch match. I would not be surprised at all if the climax of the entire series revolves around who took who to the Hogswart prom. In fact, if I am not mistaken, there was some kind of prom or dance in Half-blood Prince, and Harry asked the most unlikely of dates, Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch) to attend.

While we are on the subject, according to my sister the relationship between Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger was much better established in the book. She had more motivation for liking Ron in the book, but on screen, we're not buying it. Why aren't Harry Potter and Hermione Granger getting together? Actually, Emma Watson is out of BOTH Harry and Ron's league. They are like the chubby fanboy who tried to give Megan Fox the yellow rose and was completely ignored. She is like the girl next door who overnight morphs into a Super Model. Harry does kiss someone in the latest installment, and I would say who, but I don't want to spoil it. The kiss is a big deal, even overshadowing the death of a main character -- again, I won't say who, but we know it's not Harry Potter, although, Harry might feel a little guilt about standing by and not doing anything.

Enough, already. I am starting to ramble. The next thing I would like to talk about is the villains. Draco Malvoy (Tom Felton) makes a pretty menacing villain, with his hair so blonde it is almost white. Lord Voldemort is not seen at all, but somehow his presence was felt. Kind of think that this movie is just a set up for the movies to come. The final showdown between Harry and Voldemort. They do have scenes of Voldemort as a boy, Tom Riddle at 11, and he is played by Hero Fiennes-Tiffin. He takes that kind of creepy look that Draco has and raises it to the nth magnitude. Our young anti-hero, Hero Fiennes-Tiffin is related to Ralph Fiennes, who plays Voldemort, but he was not only cast because he resembled his Uncle Ralph, he also had that deep and dark look that hinted of the evil to come...

Harry Potter: Did you know, sir? Then?
Albus Dumbledore: Did I know that I just met the most dangerous dark wizard of all time? No.
===============================

Anyway, seeing a Harry Potter movie for the first time, it is easy to see why so many love them. I think the audience may have been split between those who want the films to be exactly like the book, and those who don't mind the film going in a different direction than the book if it could make for a better movie. J.K. Rowling has endorsed the second approach, although she would intervene if the movie veers too far away. For instance, when the script had Dumbledore remembering an episode from his past where he loved a girl, J.K. stepped in and said that could NEVER happen because... well, you'll just have to watch and find out, won't you?

There is a third group, and that is my group, the people who don't care if it follows the book or not, because they haven't read the books. Just looking at it as a movie, without any preconceptions, I would say that there are great special effects and art direction. They really create a world and inhabit it with strange creatures that look right at home. I can see that these movies make a lot of money, and they really go all out, pumping the profits back into the products. The Potter movie I saw was really a great example of movie making craft at its finest. I think the fans will like Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, even if the ending is kind of anticlimactic. It is not the final showdown, but just setting the audience up for the battles to come.

3041678,3,B000ZECQ08,"As Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) begins his sixth year at Hogwarts, the forces of the Dark Lord are wreaking havoc on wizard and Muggle Londoners alike.  Headmaster Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) asks Harry to do a mysterious job for him, while Voldemort has apparently given Draco Malfoy a rather unsavory task.  Amid all this gloom and doom, young love has struck at Hogwarts and Harry, Ron, and Hermione are all under its spell.

I thought the book was bloated and pointless, so I wasn't surprised that the movie was just as tedious, with way too many characters appearing for just seconds doing incomprehensible things.  The much-touted teen romances seemed perfunctory and awkward (but the young people in the theatre audience seemed to enjoy it a lot).  Even though I read the book, I had no idea what was going on with Harry and Draco's assignments (which seemed to drag on and go nowhere); those who haven't read the book will no doubt be completely lost.

The film is way too choppy; most scenes are only seconds long with just  one or two lines of dialogue, then it's off to a completely unrelated scene.  Many much-loved characters (Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Neville, Hagrid, and a frail-looking Professor McGonagal) are reduced to mere walk-on parts and even the title character, sadly, gets too little screen time.  On the plus side, the star of the show, Michael Gambon finally seems likeable and Bonnie Wright (Ginny) is slightly less wooden than in the past.

But if you liked the book, you'll love the movie.",1247702400,2,1513,4.829457364341085
3041679,2,B000ZECQ08,"When I watched the fifth installment in the series, ""The order of the Phoenix"", I was blown away. I was darker, grittier, more spectacular and interesting than any other in the series. Actually, if you ask me, I have vivid memories of something spectacular happening in each and everyone of the previous movies. (The Basilisc in part 2, The dementor's in part 3, voldemort's appearances in 4 and 5, and specially the good vs evil wizard's battle in part 5. Do you know what happened in this one? NOTHING. Yup. nothing whatsoever. And even thou the nmovie was not boring, It could have been SO MUCH MORE. But apparently warner decided the series was turning too dark and grittier and they decided to go back to their roots in this one and make it flimsier childish and stupid. The teen angst factor eclipses the magic factor which is something that ruined the movie.  I want to hear more of the backstory, more of the characters. Like Snape. Which is a character that has intrigued me since part 1. I want to hear more of Dumbledore and his relationship with Tom Riddle. Show me more of each wizard and what makes him tick, how did they become who they are today, take me to the depths of Hogwarts and show me the secrets it conceals and give me a glimpse of all the wonderful things those old walls have witnessed in the lat 1000 years. But but do we get to see any of that? Of course not. All those elements are cut from the movie to be replaced by stupid childish crushes and what not.

There's an excellent review here an amazon by a user called JR. (Is actually voted the most helpful critical review). What he said in his review is basically every single thing I ranted about in the car with my wife when we were driving back from the theater. Read his review. It's way deeper than mine and he actually read the book. (I didn't). Book which by the way, after reading JR's review I just ordered in order to fill in the gaps of everything warner removed from the movie in order to make it look like Hannah Montana.",1247702400,16,2017,4.390374331550802
3041680,5,B000ZECQ08,"That about sums it up.

The whole point of this film, the whole point of the movie as well.

At the hidden entrance to the cave, when Dumbledore cuts his hand to spill his blood in order to open the secret passage, and Harry says he should have done it, where in Dumbledore answers with the aforementioned line, is the whole reason for the film and the book. Not just to discover Voldemorts weakness, or to try and destroy him, but for Harry to try and finally realize just how precious he is.

That is the main point of the film, and I was very glad to see it.  There were alot of changes made to the film, but changes that I felt were warrented and appropriate. We, as Harry Potter movie fans have seen the big huge epic scenes! We had Dumbledore's and Voldemort's duel at the end of Order of the Phoenix, in the same movie we had the duel between the children and the death eaters. In Goblet of Fire we had Dragons, and amazing broom flights, and in all the other films we had fantastic Quidditch games and mesmorizing magic being performed in classrooms.

What I felt the film brought focus on was the relationships of Harry and Dumbledore; Harry, Ron and Hermione; and just the children in general, because as us Potter fans know those relationships are pivotal in the last book, and therefore also in the last films.

The deletions made sense to me, the film was smaller, more self contained. It was a relationship drama, not an epic battle film, that's for ""Deathly Hallows"". We fans have the book to read for the thrill of Dumbledore's army fending off the Death Eater's, and the extra little pieces of information. This film was about finding who you are and doing so with little help from the one person you most rely on.  It was about Harry's journey into realizing what he has to do, and that he can't and ultimately couldn't have Dumbledore's help or protection to get it done.

On the film side: The kids acting has improved leaps and bounds.  Emma Watson and Tom Felton (Hermione and Draco) were both very impressive, particularly Tom as Draco especially in the bathroom sequence and in the clock tower. Rupert Grint as Ron has shown just how great of a comic actor he can be.  Daniel as Harry is phenomenal and has improved leaps and bounds since Goblet of Fire.  The stand out performances for adults were the AMAZING Michael Gambon as Dumbledore who brought tears to my eyes with his powerful and stunningly gut wrenching performance.  Jim Broadbent as Horace Slughorn the new Potions teacher was delightfully funny and also a bit sad as well with his distant and pale sadness.  Helena Bonaham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange was amazingly insane and evil in this one, loved her, and although under used, I always adore every second of time Alan Rickman's Severus Snape is on screen.

The effects were amazing as well, and unlike a few of the previous films the were in no way meant to be a spectacle, in fact most of them seemed rather in the back ground letting the characters be the main attraction.  The cave of the Horocrux sequence was impressive (the infiri were CREEPY!)  And the burning of the burrow was rather impressive even with the saddness of the scene.

The tone of the film all though the films rating was PG rather than PG-13 like Goblet and Order before it, was actually much darker, which allowed the teen romance to give a great balance and needed lift to the whole affair.  I loved the film from start to finish, it was well made, well acted, and well thought through.

I know ALOT of people will fuss at my lack of caring that alot of stuff was changed or that things were added or omitted, I simple feel that the film worked well as a character piece about love and loss, and what is needed to take action and move on and discover your meaning; and this was the purpose of this film, in my opinion.",1247702400,8,3838,4.480631276901004
3041681,5,B000ZECQ08,"As a diehard Harry Potter fan, I really enjoyed HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE.  Yes, there are cuts and edits.  This movie has the same problem that all book-to-film conversions have:  you cannot put all of the detail into the film that a writer puts into a book.  As it is, HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE is nearly 3 hours long.  IMHO, the writers, director, and editors did the best jobs that they could, and this time they succeeded in giving us most of important plot points without making HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE into a multi-night miniseries.

Almost everyone knows or is at least familiar with the 7-book saga of Harry Potter written by J. K. Rowling, so I will not go into a detailed description here.  Suffice it to say, that with the exception of some minor edits and changes, the film is pretty true to the basic plotlines of the book.  Harry is the Chosen One; he must defeat Voldemort.  In HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE, Harry learns more about the history of Tom Riddle, why he became what he is, and what he must do to defeat him.

Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson continue to shine as they bring Harry, Ron, and Hermione to life.  It has been fun watching these kids and their characters change and grow.  This trio has done an unparalleled job in bringing these internationally beloved characters to life...their casting 9 years ago was farsighted and inspired.  They ARE Harry, Ron, and Hermione - exactly as I always imagined them to be.  Of course everyone in the Harry Potter films has become the personification of their characters.  From Dumbledore to Snape, McGonagall to Mrs. Weasley, Hagrid to Filch, Luna to Neville, and Draco to Riddle, these outstanding performers have created a very special and unique world, near and dear to all of our hearts.

One of the best parts of HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE was that the fun and humor are back.  This HARRY POTTER film is not as dark or bleak as the more recent films have been.  The writers and actors do a fantastic job of portraying the angst, goofiness, and raging hormones of teenaged love.  I laughed a lot watching this film, something that was sorely missed in the last film.  To quote Dumbledore, ""That was fun!""  And it was!

Of course, changes and cuts had to be made to the story to keep HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE from turning into a marathon.  While some will moan and groan over these edits, it is important to remember that all the little details, the vivid description, and needed exposition that make this world so real to us just simply cannot make the transition to the big screen.  Instead, we get color, depth, music, voices, facial expressions, body language, scenery, animals, people, and special effects to bring this world to life.  In the case of HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE, it seems to be a very successful trade off.  All the important plot points are made, and the final two films are well set up.  I am also going to hazard a guess that a few of the missing story lines from HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE will be moved into the next film, and that makes good sense to me.

Overall, HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE was fun, funny, and familiar.  The magic is back, and it certainly worked wonders on me.  HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE is MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1247702400,6,3380,4.631932773109244
3041682,4,B000ZECQ08,"Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. As it compares to the other films, it was better than some but not the best. B+  Mainly because I think the changes they made to the climax weren't as good as the original material.

Unlike some fans of the books, I don't automatically think ""sacrilege!"" when material is cut from the book to make the film. Mostly I agree. I think the storyline with Hagrid and his giant brother from Phoenix was fluff in the book and so not needed in the film. Occasionally I disagree. I wasn't too thrilled that they cut Hermione's clever besting of Rita Skeeter in Goblet, but could see why the filmmakers did so - that would have added more time to an already long movie. Film is a different medium for story-telling and I enjoy it on its own merits. But, the cuts/changes they made to ""Half-Blood Prince"" just didn't seem necessary to me.

I'm not talking about the majority of the film (or the fact that the title BARELY got an explanation). My criticism stems from the climactic death scene at the end. STOP HERE IF YOU DON'T ALREADY KNOW WHO DIED! In the book, Dumbledore and Harry return from their mission to find the school under attack from Death Eaters. Dumbledore's Army is holding them off, with some help from a luck potion, until the Order of the Phoenix can arrive to back them up. This was completely cut. We don't get to see the kids in action, which was a big disappointment and made the arrival of the Death Eaters an after-thought. I didn't feel any particular menace or surprise that they were in the school. Then, on top of the tower, Dumbledore has Harry hide under his invisibility cloak and then paralyzes him there. Not so in the film. Harry hides underneath the stairs and ""valiantly"" manages to restrain himself from coming to Dumbledore's aid (which doesn't jive with his character). Then, Dumbledore confronts Draco AND the Death Eaters. They weren't in this scene! I love Bellatrix's character, but it seemed they changed the scene just so she could be in it. It didn't work. Rowling's original set-up was superior. Had they kept it, this would easily have been the best HP film.

Despite this, I did enjoy the movie a lot. Prince, as the penultimate novel, was really more of staging point/set-up for the finale, so it didn't have as much action as the other books, or films. It did have a lot of character development though. The film provoked much more laughter than any other HP film, and still captured the spirit of the book very well. I cried when he died, so I obviously felt connected to the characters, as intended.  This movie was quite good, and I will buy it on DVD so I can watch it again, but it also could have been that much better.",1247702400,4,2705,4.534836065573771

3041684,5,B000ZECQ08,"I loved this movie. It is by far the best of the series.

Anyone who has written a review or will write a review bashing this movie because it isn't just like the book, need to take a step back. If you don't go to these movies expecting big changes, then you, my friend are a complete idiot.
Think of them as two entirely different entities, because they are. If they tried to copy all of the brilliant novel into the movie, it would be a complete mess. Books are beautiful and can take the time to develop smaller story threads and secondary characters, but movies don't have that luxury. They have to be more focused on main characters and the main plot line.
For example, one reviewer was barking mad because the Dumbledore withered hand story thread was, as he put it, ""glossed over"". No offense, but it is pretty glossed over in the book as well. It is mentioned more, but you don't really find out the whole story about it until the seventh book anyway, so why waste screen time on it.

I love the books. They are the most outstanding read on my book shelf, and I continue to pour through them over and over. The books are better than the movies, but then again, when isn't that true???? The books are always better than the movies!!!!! That doesn't mean that the movies can't be enjoyed and loved for what they are.
I for one, admire what the screen writers do. I would hate to try and condense JK's brilliant novels into workable screen scripts.

In short, don't be a moron. Love the books and then go see the movies and love them too!!! You can love both. Just remember they aren't going to be the same!!! If you don't, you are robbing yourself of the pleasure of enjoying some great cinema, BASED ON a bloody brilliant set of books.",1247702400,6,1742,4.37037037037037
3041685,3,B000ZECQ08,"As a huge Harry Potter fan who has read the last two books with excitment and breathlessness, I had come to this film prepared to accept that the film is always different from the book and that I should steel myself. And I did, briefy, till I started to see the glaring omissions in this film that were left on the cutting room floor.  Yes, I am well aware that the whole book cannot be filmed, understandable, but the heart of the book is Tom Riddle and the mystery of the Half blood Prince, anyone who is a true Potter fan should take no issue with that.  So riddle me this with the following glaring holes in this film that are central heart of the story--let's a look at them...

There are a number of flash back scenes that build Tom Riddle's character. We get two. No mention of his affection for Hogwarts, or why Dumbledore was drawn to him. No mention of how he forms the cruxis of the death eaters while he is a student there, which includes Snape.

Our wonderful Wizard's hand- how did it get that way? Harry barely registers any surprise.  Why show his hand if you are not going to explain how he got that way and how crucial it is to the story.  Makes little sense.

The Half Blood Prince.  The whole counter point to Tom Riddle is Snape. It is barely given a glancing blow in the film and Alan Rickman's role is wasted as his entire back story is thrown to the cutting room floor. Why spend so much time with this character if you are going to gut his part in the story.

Silly Teen Romance. Yes we all enjoy the moments of light humor and teen angst, but why amp it up so high for this one and leave all the good stuff on the trash pile.  There is way to much silliness in this film that takes away from the story and all I wanted to do was go back to the real tale each time they deal with this nonsense. Rowling new that these romances have to play a back shadow to much larger issues in the story, the directors decided after all the criticisms that the film was becoming increasingly dark that they'd lighten it up.  Big mistake.

Harry and his connection to Tom Riddle is also given no shrift at all, not even short shrift. Hell, The Dark one himself other then The Tom Riddle flashback, makes no appearence.

The last twenty minutes are from the last part of the book, so how can you forget the dumbledore funeral and battle with the death eaters when malfoy lets them in. gone!!

The heart of this movie is left out, and I fear audiences are embracing it because it is Harry Potter. Please go read the Half blood prince so you can see what you are missing. You won't regret it. It's a masterful book.  It is a shame the directors could not take the proper time and care to give it its due.",1247702400,27,2710,4.204633204633205
3041686,2,B000ZECQ08,"I don't know why some directors feel the need to change the movie adaption unecessarily.  Also with this movie and the last there was no feeling for Dumbledore, I didn't care that he died or that he had to drink the potion.

Why did they make Snape look like a rock-star with flowing clean hair?  Snapes intentions were too obvious as to what he did at the end.

Did the creators even read the book or just base the movie on a synopsis?",1247702400,13,436,4.216867469879518
3041687,2,B000ZECQ08,"I found Half-Blood to be very depressing and even worse, so predictable! There is no greater sin in writing a story, except being boring! The story also made no sense. No, I did not read the books, nor would I ever waste my time. The only strength in the world of Harry Potter is the bond amongst friends. This strong sense of friendship and loyalty is the only reason this annoying film was given two stars instead of one!

I guess that's the reason why I, and many other people, keep going to the theater. Of the six films, only the previous one, ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"" felt enjoyable and made plenty of sense. In Half-Blood, I'm amazed that you can kill off a major character and have even Harry Potter, himself, going around saying: ""It was a waste, it had no meaning. He died for nothing."" How ironic when a story's main character literally sums up the ENTIRE story!

I had high hopes for Half-Blood! I don't like seeing Harry Potter and all the other ""Good Guys"" being so powerless/clueless, or a main character turning into pure evil for absolutely no reason, whatsoever! (I should be able to know what's going on by not having to read the books. I have watched every film in order, but it still made no sense!)

What is obvious to me is that the Harry Potter series has become a commodity like toothpaste and underarm deodorant! Lets stretch a very thin storyline into as many billions of dollars as possible, and see all the star-struck idiots spend their money! Sorry to say, Harry Potter could have easily been condensed into a trilogy and if Half-Blood was never written/filmed it would not have harmed the Harry Potter storyline ONE iota!

Sorry, but when the grand finale(s) (I just heard the ending is being split into two movies! What a surprise) comes out, I'm skipping the theaters and  I'll watch it when I can see it for free. I have spent enough money on Harry Potter movie tickets and I have no intention, whatsoever, to waste another penny on making the writers and filmmakers of Harry Potter, richer!

3041688,5,B000ZECQ08,"I just got back from seeing it a few hours ago and it's very good, it's yet another amazing ""Harry Potter"" movie! I loved it! Just like the book, this movie focuses on Harry and Dumbledore using Voldemort's memories to try to find his seven Horcruxes in order to destroy them all and defeat him. In order to do this, Dumbledore and Harry hire a new teacher for the Potions class, Horace Slughorn, who has the memory of when Voldemort finds out about Horcruxes and decides to make them, which he doesn't want to give up. Also, Voldemort makes Draco Malfoy try to kill Dumbledore and, at the beginning of the film, the Death Eaters destroy a huge bridge in the Muggle world and eventually attack the Weasleys. Finally, there's a lot of stuff about the relationships/love between the characters, such as Lavender Brown falling in love with, and stalking, Ron, Harry eventually falling in love with, and kissing Ginny, and Ron and Hermione falling in love with each other. Eventually, the events of Dumbledore and Harry looking for and finding some of the Horcruxes leads to Dumbledore being killed by Snape, and a very powerful, emotionally moving ending. The storyline includes almost everything from the book, except, unfortunately, Kreacher and Dobby, Winky, and the other house-elves, and some of the scenes are a little bit less dramatic, such as when Harry has to force Dumbledore to drink the pain-inducing potion so they can get a Horcrux and when Harry battles Snape after Snape killed Dumbledore. The special effects are incredible, just like the other ""Harry Potter"" movies, such as when Dumbledore and Harry apparate to the cave where Voldemort's Horcrux is and the computer-animated Inferi. I loved this movie and I'm going to get it on DVD when it comes out! It was another amazing ""Harry Potter"" movie and I can't wait to see ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Parts One and Two"" when they come out in 2010 and 2011 and I'm going to get them on DVD too! After you see this movie, you'll be very excited for the last two movies!",1247616000,4,2043,4.741573033707865
3041689,4,B000ZECQ08,"While the fifth installment provided some of the darkest moments seen in the series, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince displays an even more sinister and morbid approach to the deadly witchcraft and devious wizardry. But with that darkness comes an alleviating light found in the romantic mishaps and jealous tussles between the students. Blending the foreboding presence of encroaching doom with Quidditch practice, schoolwork, and blossoming high school romances, the sixth entry in the legacy of Harry Potter is simultaneously the most mature and the most entertaining, though the days of playful sorcery and lighthearted misadventures are long gone.

In the sixth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry it is dark times indeed. The school itself has become a breeding ground for danger and deception and the surmounting minions of the evil Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) have brought forth destruction even to the innocents of the outside world of muggles. As a new potions teacher, Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent), is recruited for mysterious reasons, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) must contend with ominous missions from Headmaster Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) as well as his growing feelings for Ginny Weasly (Bonnie Wright) and the newfound jealous tension between his best friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson).

If you're willing to make the five-movie investment, the sixth Harry Potter film is well worth the time. Startlingly suspenseful, tenebrous and scarier than the previous films, with a generously lenient PG rating, the characters have finally reached the point where their budding relationships and daunting trials against the dark arts are almost entirely adult. It's a new kind of Harry Potter film with a Tim Burtonesque feel and wondrously foreboding sets and atmospheres (Diagon Alley now resembles the battered, rain-beaten streets in Sweeney Todd). Harry always seems to be covered in blood or unconscious, Hogwart's security has reached the point of a prison, the spells have turned to curses, the charms into hexes, and the potions into deadly black magic. Even the colors appear washed with blackness or drastically muted. By the end of it all, Harry's going to need an extra dose of liquid luck and the audience will need a hearty round of butterbeer with ginger.

Perhaps most appealing about the series is the opportunity to see a group of children become young adults, and to journey with them in their adventurous maturation. Any one year seems inconsequential compared to the larger picture, the grand scheme of mastering fantastical powers and defeating the many avenues of evil. Along the way there are plenty of chances at humor and lightheartedness, especially in the evolving relationships (such as a spirited snogging-filled love triangle) between Harry, Hermione, Ginny, Ron, and newcomer Lavender Brown, as well as several important supporting characters including the many schoolteachers, friends, families and enemies. As the characters become old enough for their interactions and expressions to mean more and for their actions to become more significant, powerful or even fatal, the entertainment is more solid and the story more fulfilling. Even if it plays out like they're all making it up as they go, the tragedies feel authentic and the leads are genuinely sympathetic. Finally the chemistry, adventure, special effects and fantasy can all be taken seriously.

3041690,3,B000ZECQ08,This movie was really slow to me. I have never read the book so I don't have a comparison between the two. I was pretty much bored until about the last 35 to 40 minutes. The movie really picked up around that time frame. The story and a lot of the action come together during this time frame. The special effects and the cinematography were pretty good. It was the story that was a little too slow for me. My 10 year old son read all the series and told me he liked the book better than the movie. This movie is really for hard core Harry Potter fans.,1247616000,2,551,4.064220183486238
3041691,5,B000ZECQ08,"`Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince' was a pretty good movie. Actually, it was better than I expected and one of my favorites. As with the rest of the movie, the plot moves as super speed as entire parts of the book are eliminated. This makes the movie feel a little choppy and dizzying, often. This is definitely not a stand alone film, and if you have not seen the others or read the books, you are going to feel very lost.

The cinematography is amazing; it is the best of all the movies so far. The movie has amazingly breathtaking scenes, a great score and tons of action.

This film follows Harry Potter, a wizard, through his sixth year at Hogwarts, a school for wizards. Harry is the chosen one, he alone has to the power to defeat Voldermont, a dark wizard who terrorized the magic world and killed Harry's parents. This movie centers around Harry learning more about how to defeat Voldermont from Dumbledore, the headmaster. This is also a movie that deals with character's relationships to one another as battle lines are drawn and romantic relationships deepen.

However, tons of things were left out, as always. But, this felt more like they chopped away half of the book. Poof, these parts are no more. And they were important parts: explaining more about the Horcruxes, Slytherin's locket, the funeral, Harry and Ginny's relationship...

And did the Inferi (corpses controlled by dark magic) have to look so much like Gollum?

It was a very good movie. It felt pretty short (even thought it was 153 mins long) as a result of the chopping of many parts of the stories. But, I still liked it. A lot.",1247616000,3,1616,4.616724738675958
3041692,4,B000ZECQ08,"After the utter disaster that was the Clif's Notes movie version of ""Harry Potter and The Order of the Phoenix"" (see my review for that film), I was filled with very great trepidation that this series was entirely doomed.  I went into the theater half expecting that David Yates and Co. would butcher yet another great book.

I must admit that I was wrong.

""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" is a good movie!

There is a lot to like about this film, and the criticisms I have are relatively minor.

Before I discuss details, I'll say this, though:  What is most important is that they got the FEEL of the book right.  There is emotion here, thank goodness!  Laughter, sadness, romance.  Wonderful!  Thank you, Steve Kloves, for writing a good screenplay!  Welcome back!  (Kloves was the screenwriter for every HP movie other than OOTP.)

Now, down to the details...  (I'll put in here *SPOILER ALERT*, but you kinda should expect that.)

Every time a book is converted into a movie, the two main criticisms that lovers of the book have are ones of omission and commission.  That is, the moviemakers either leave out beloved scenes, or choose to add their own scenes that AREN'T in the book.  Being somewhat of a purist myself, I usually prefer that the movie stick as closely to the book as possible, like Lord of the Rings mostly did.  However, a movie is a movie and a book is a book---so the real question in my mind is whether or not the omissions and commissions are basically positive and make a good film.

OOTP did both of these things badly-- it left out really important stuff, and the stuff it added was just bad.

HBP mostly did both of these things well-- it left in most of the important stuff, and (other than one thing) added mostly good additional scenes.

The movie begins with Death Eaters wreaking havoc in Muggle London, and Harry Potter putting the moves on a pretty Muggle waitress.  There is no meeting with the Muggle Prime Minister, like in the book.  (I'm fine with that--- you have to cut SOMETHING.)  Things are looking bad.

Harry and Dumbledore visit a potential new Potions professor, Horace Slughorn. Harry manages to convince him to come back to Hogwarts--- as he learns later, because has something that Dumbledore wants, and he thinks Harry can get it from him.

From there, the movie pretty much follows the plot of the book fairly closely.  Most well-loved scenes from the book are here--- some done better than others, but all are mostly OK.

One thing that the screenwriters added that I think was actually an IMPROVEMENT over the book is that they flesh out the budding romance between Harry and Ginny, and between Ron and Hermione. (To be honest, in my opinion the relationship between Harry and Ginny wasn't given enough development in the books-- one of the few criticisms I had of the books.)  These additional scenes are really done well.  They are heartfelt and subtle, not cheesy at all.  I really loved the scene on the stairs where Harry and Hermione comfort each other because each is in love with someone who is currently with someone else.

I won't parse the rest of the film, since everyone basically knows the plot.  But most things are done well.

Now, onto my several minor criticisms.

First of all, the filmmakers added a scene which I felt was gratuitous and stupid, and which added nothing to the story at all.  In one scene the Death Eaters attack The Burrow and destroy it.  That was just needless and heartless.  The Burrow was the one place where Harry could feel safe, and to destroy it felt like a kick in the gut for no reason.  You know, as long as there is a Shire to go back to, there is always something to fight for.  To destroy the Burrow-- the one place Harry felt most at home--- was a serious misstep as far as I'm concerned, because it just made the whole endeavor now feel hopeless.  Seriously, WHY DO THIS???  This was the one major mistake I feel the filmmakers made.

A couple other minor criticisms are that I felt that the movie Slughorn could have been a little sluggier and and little more pompous.  The movie version was a little too normal for my liking.  Not horrible, still pretty good--- but not great, and not as memorable as the book.

Another thing I think might have been better was the actor who played the teenage Voldemort.  I was a great fan of the actor Christian Coulson who played Tom Riddle in Chamber of Secrets.  He got the teenage Tom Riddle down perfectly--- charismatic, enigmatic, charming, with just a touch of an undercurrent of danger--- and TOTALLY memorable.  The young actor who plays Tom Riddle in this film plays him more creepy, less human, and entirely less charming, charismatic and memorable.  He plays him like those creepy kids who roam the hallways in The Shining--- and kind of looks like them too.

One other things I was a tad bit disappointed in was that the Great Hall in this film is not as great as those in the other films---- I don't know how they did it, but this Great Hall is much SMALLER!

However, let me reemphasize:

Other than those minor complaints, Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince is a GOOD movie, with heart, feeling, romance, action and intrigue.  A worthy contribution to the HP movie canon.

Enjoy!",1247616000,,5259,4.596774193548387
3041693,3,B000ZECQ08,"On a scale of one to five, I only give ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" three stars...and that's being incredbly generous.

I really, really, REALLY wanted to like this film, and there are moments of the movie that are absolutely fantastic. The problem is that all those scenes start off great, and then fizzle out into nothing spectacular. This film also cuts and changes a lot of info from the book, and changes certain things from the novel that had no business being changed. I just don't understand it.

Without giving too much away, here are some of the things that irked me about this movie (if you haven't read the book, though, beware that there are spoilers ahead):

 - The first 20 minutes or so of the film are AWFUL. They are nothing like the opening chapters of the book, which is a huge disappointment. Dumbledore especially bothers me at the beginning of the movie. His dialogue is ridiculous, and the significance of his withered hand are glossed over in an offhand remark to Harry. (Also, that hand looks nothing like it should. In the movie, Dumbledore's hand looks like its owner has merely been outside gardening for a couple of hours. In the book, the hand is supposed to be a black, charred, disgusting mess. Why cut corners on the big screen?)

- Also in regards to the first few minutes of the book, I was disappointed that the Snape/Narcissa/Bellatrix scene was pushed back until later in the film, and was exceptionally brief. It could have been much better.

- Too much of the movie was devoted to silly romance. Don't get me wrong: The Ron/Hermione/Lavender triangle was a big part of Book Six, and the actress playing Lavender in the film was absolutely hysterical. However, too much time was devoted to teenage romance instead of other important plot elements that were completely cut out  of the film altogether.

- Speaking of silly romance, the Harry/Ginny relationship was really shafted in the movie. It started off well, but never really climaxed at all. At the end of the book, Harry and Ginny are officially an item, and there's a very poignant moment where Harry tells Ginny why they can't be together because he'll inadvertently put her in danger and because he needs to fulfill his destiny, etc. That scene was completely omitted from the movie, and in the film, you really don't know if Harry and Ginny are really together or not. It's ridiculous!

- Fenrir Greyback's character in the movie was a MASSIVE disappointment. He appeared in the film, but no one even really knew that he was a werewolf, because the whole scene where he attacks Bill Weasley was omitted from the film! Why include the character at all if they were going to cut that scene? It makes absolutely no sense!

- Too much time was devoted to Draco Malfoy practicing for his ""grand event."" Tom Felton did a great job portraying Draco in this film, but seriously, did the filmmakers really need to include four or five separate scenes of Draco practicing using the vanishing cabinet? I don't think so.

- For me, the last 25 minutes or so of the film were the biggest disappointment of all. The worst part about it is that certain aspects of these scenes were amazing: the visual setting when Dumbledore and Harry arrive at the mouth of the cave, the dialogue between Snape and Dumbledore at the tower, etc. Unfortunately, though, the scenes that started off great ended up sucking. For example, the ""evil souls"" living in the lake were total rip-offs of Gollum from ""The Lord of the Rings,"" and didn't look anything like I imagined that they should. Also, I hated the death scene at the end, which was poorly done and happened way too quickly. The Snape/Harry confrontation at the end of the film also seemed incredibly lackluster. I really wanted Harry to scream at Snape and go nuts on him, but instead Daniel Radcliffe just kind of muttered, ""Coward,"" and that was it.

- The ending of the film was TERRIBLE! After the death, only about 30 people were gathered around the body, and no one was freaking out the way they do in the book. HELLO! One of the most important characters in the series is dead! Doesn't anyone care? All they do is hold their wands up in the air for a few seconds in some sort of pathetic salute. It's awful! It was so subdued. And where was the funeral?! In the book, people travel from all over the world to attend the service, and the coffin goes up in white flames, which would have been a great way to end the movie. Instead, the audience was left with a boring shot of the back of Harry, Ron, and Hermione's heads. It was awful!

I really expected more from this film. Again, I will concede that there were some decent moments, but I think the script and the overall direction were severely lacking. I really hope they don't screw up the final two films in the series. Warner Brothers Execs, if you are reading this, I hereby volunteer to adapt the screenplay for ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,"" and to direct both movies for free just to make sure they are done right!",1247616000,26,5030,4.6067039106145256
3041694,4,B000ZECQ08,"One aspect of this series that consistently impresses me is seeing how the characters grow both in written word and film. ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" is a darker, harsher world than the previous entries leading into the conclusion of the series.

In the very beginning, we see devastating attacks by the death eaters on London in full view of the regular (muggle) population. Albus Dumbledore (Gambon) solicits Harry Potter (Radcliffe) to come with him to convince retired Prof. Slughorn (Broadbent) to come back to Hogwarts to teach Potions. There's more than just filling an empty faculty chair on the cagey wizard's mind, though.  He wants Harry to allow Slughorn to 'capture' him.

Harry returns to the Weasley home to BFF's Ron (Grint) and Hermione (Watson) and the rest of the clan. Disappearances are still happening and many parents do not want their children to return to Hogwarts.  Even Hermoine's muggle family don't want her back.

Next, we move to Severus Snape (Rickman) taking an oath to protect Draco Malfoy (Felton) and help him carry out the mission Voldemort has pressed upon him.

Definitely an excellent setup for a film where a lot has to happen even in a three-hour timespan.  The cast is getting older. Harry and Hermione are both suffering the blues when their respective love interests are turning to others. Dumbledore is relying more and more on Harry who has learned to simply go with it. Of course, there are the usual intrigues and Quidditch games as well.

This is not my favorite HP film, but definitely one I would own and very much worth the time to see it on opening night.  Excellent setup for the final two films in the series.  I will hate to say goodbye to this cast.

3041695,3,B000ZECQ08,"The much touted 6th Harry Potter movie made quite a spectacle, tons of effects, beautiful shots and the old crowd all together.  It filled up a lot of midnight movie screen in my area.  I decided to wait till the next day and was very glad I did.

Harry Potter and the half blood prince was a cute movie about dating and teenage angst, but it really wasn't worth all the fuss.  It seemed like it was trying to be a serious Hanna Montana episode in terms of how it did things.

Individual scenes were interesting, the Broadbent plot was fair, but the whole deatheater bit just didn't seem to have any purpose.

The entire plot surrounding Draco was wasted.  It consisted of ""I'm going to brood over here."", then ""I'm going to brood over here now."" until the climax.  If you are going to have a tortured soul in an interactive medium like movies you need more than just sitting here there and everywhere looking pained.  When the climax came Draco didn't seem like someone torn over what he has to do, he seems like a little git.  That was ok when he was a first or second year but at this point in the series that's not where we should be.

The big three have grown into the characters and where worth seeing but even good performances by them couldn't bail out bad writing.

The plan is to milk the last book by making it two movies, hopefully this will give them enough time to make things work.

For the visuals alone you should see it in a theater but it just isn't any better than average.",1247616000,3,1493,4.308243727598566
3041696,5,B000ZECQ08,"I'm not gonna give too much away, since fans who haven't seen it will be bitching about me giving all the changes away and crap. But anyways, this was an amazing movie... and yes I did read the book.

It was every bit as dark, grim and depressing as the book, and every bit as fun too. The acting was the real highlight- Radcliffe turns in an amazing performance as Harry once again, and Watson's crying scene was one of the most beautiful scenes ever filmed. The quidditch scenes were the amazing too! I'm glad they brought back the Quidditch. Also, the cave scene was brilliant, as it had one of the scariest jump scenes ever.

So overall, this was a fun movie, and a good time at the cinema. The second best movie of the year thus far! I hope to see it again at the IMAX upon IMAX release. And it's definitely The Dark Knight of the year too- bring on Deathly Hallows!",1247616000,2,871,4.2727272727272725
3041697,3,B000ZECQ08,"First of all, I have to say, I love the Harry Potter series, the movies as much as the books. And until now, every movie brought the flair the books had adequately to the big screen, without losing the essential messages and story points.
And now we have Half-Blood Prince.
I was curious how the movie would start, given the various excellent options by Rowling. Maybe the ingenius visit of Dumbledore at the Dursleys? Or the thrilling scene with the Unbreakable Vow? None of those! Of course not! Who would like to have a classic Harry Potter scene as the opener of your movie? The screenwriters flexed their muscles and came up with a brilliant bit of Potter legend: Harry picking up a funky chick at a Diner!

Now a simple question: here you have a book with 600 pages, and you actually choose to come up with THAT, thus bewildering the fans from the very first frame?
I mean, come on! The book has more than enough teenage romance already, what is the damn point of making stuff up?
And this does not remain the only major detour. Really, I have no objection to adding a few bits, as long as they are true to the story and the characters - but what on earth possessed Yates and Kloves to light the Burrow on fire?
This attack by the Death Eaters is THE textbook example of pointless guff, since nothing happens. And it hurts all the more if you consider for a moment that they conceived that scene instead of filming Harry's conversation with Scrimgeour, the new minister of magic.

But speaking of teenage romance, this was obviously a major part of the book, and honestly, it works better here than in textform. It is also quite logical that all the bickering and all the twists between Ron and Hermione, involving Ginny and Harry, simple can't be fleshed out, so consequently their row is not nearly as dramatic as in the book. In the book, Ron was first angry because he watched Ginny kissing Dean, which resulted in Ron being angry at Hermione because she kissed Victor Krum, which he wouldn't tell her, all of that causing Ron to go for Lavender Brown, and that finally pushed Hermione over the edge.
It's already exhausting explaining it, can you blame Yates for not putting ALL that into the film?
The sudden interest between Ron and Hermione, and Harry and Ginny, feel like out of the blue, but the movie can't mend what the book did.

What he substracted from the romance stories, he added to the Snape/Malfoy storyline. And I don't mean scenes, I mean additional layers. And those layers come dangerously close to compromising the point the book tries to make.
To be perfectly clear: Severus Snape is a Death Eater, he always was, he only spied on Dumbledore. He has no remorse, no second doubt. He offers to make the Unbreakable Vow. He is a villain, pure and simple. That's what makes him killing Dumbledore dramatic.
Here, in the film, Snape is pushed by Bellatrix to make the Vow, clearly indicating that he is a man in doubt, pushed to do it. That is wrong, simply.
Plus, by saying verbatim that Katie was supposed to bring the cursed amulet to Dumbledore, by *showing* several times what Malfoy is doing in the Room Of Requirement, by already piecing the puzzle together along the way, the film lacks some surprise, since Dumbledore's death at the hand of Snape does not come as a shock like in the book, it is a natural consequence.
And it isn't even handled properly.
The whole point is that Dumbledore was poisened, weak. Hearing Death Eaters coming, he uses his last chance of defending himself to stun Harry, to protect him. And Snape has Dumbledore at his mercy, he is killing a poisened, defenseless man. The movie is not nearly brutal enough in that regard.
And it does not even make the point explicitly that Dumbledore's trust in Snape was wrong.
Rowling knew what she was writing in those crucial scenes, surely there is no point in completely rewriting it, implicating that it wasn't good.

Why is it so hard for these people to follow simple rules? Cut parts that don't disturb the main story. Use editorial force if following the book word by word takes too long. Make the point the book is trying to make, even if you have to do it in a slightly different way. Don't leave out signature set pieces of the book.
In short, Dumbledore's funeral is not there. That is a no-no. And unforgiveable if you ask me.
And what is that stupid ceremony at the end anyway? All the students standing there, were they rehearsing that collective lightshow in case Dumbledore ever gets killed?

The point is that things were changed for no reason. If you show Harry getting the memory from Slughorn by using Felix Felicis, the for god's sake do it like the book does, and not like THIS. They obviously didn't get the point that the potion causes coincidences leading to your goal.

One other minus point is that Harry's lessons in Dumbledore's office seem to serve no reason. It's just presented like ""here is that little story I want to show you"".
It is simply never explained why those memories are of any importance at all. If they wanted to set up the Horcrux storyline, then surely the story of the House Of Gaunt or the story of the cup and the locket would suit the case better than that short visit at the orphanage.

The visuals are fine, and in fact very moody and atmospheric. It's just obscure to me why a large part of the movie is coloured with that greenish hue, and the only scene in the book that actually mentions the green light - in the cave - does not have it.
The music is terrible. Truly horrid. A string ostinato here, and a string of chords there, that's all there's to it. It's not even atmospheric music, it's Nicholas Hooper desperately hitting random chords.
Often I just thought ""he didn't score THIS?""
Some pieces from the album are not there, and during the Quidditch tryouts, the original score, whatever it was, was replaced by Order of the Phoenix music.

All in all, if you have never read the book, you might enjoy this as much as the other films, but if you read it, prepare to not be overwhelmed.",1247616000,14,6052,4.540788267644363
3041698,5,B000ZECQ08,"I'm not sure anyone will be prepared for the ending of ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince."" Even if, like me, you've already read the book and know what happens, there's something about actually seeing it on screen that thoroughly and devastatingly brings it home. That's the magic of the movies for you. Indeed, this sixth installment may be the most magical yet ... albeit magical in that heavy, sinister sort of way, as if Lord Voldermort himself waved his wand and cast a spell on it. Strange that this is simultaneously the darkest film in the series and the funniest, the sense of humor having matured from innocent and childlike to troubled and adolescent. Stranger still that this is the best ""Harry Potter"" film since the original ""Sorcerer's Stone,"" a brighter and much more whimsical and story in all respects.

When reviewing ""Order of the Phoenix"" a few years ago, I begrudgingly remarked that I had to accept the ever-changing nature of the series, that the wondrous atmosphere of Chris Columbus' original film had developed into something denser and would never go back. I now find myself in the exact same position with ""Half-Blood Prince."" But I can't kid myself--this is a superbly made fantasy, and in spite of increasingly dark material, it retains much of the charm that attracted me to the series in the first place. The performances, even by briefly seen actors like Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, Helena Bonham Carter, David Thewlis, and Warwick Davis, are very good. The set design and cinematography are stunning. The special effects are dazzling. The mystery is engrossing. Just like before, it's all there--it's only gotten a little less bright on the way. Hogwarts, for example, no longer seems like an adventurous labyrinth of surprises but like a gloomy, gothic fortress, and the school grounds are foggier and less colorful.

The first part of the story: After the dreaded Death Eaters attack London in full view of Muggles, our increasingly burdened Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is lead by Headmaster Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) to the home of Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent), a former Hogwarts professor who knew Voldermort when he was a boy still going by the name Tom Riddle. Dumbledore convinces Slughorn to come out of hiding and return to school as the new Potions teacher. He also relies on Harry to get close to join Slughorn's class and get to know him, which shouldn't be too hard since Slughorn loves to play favorites with his students. But why does he want Harry to do this? What does Slughorn have that Dumbledore wants?

More important questions arise. Who is the titular Half-Blood Prince, and why did he add notes and revisions to every potion spell in Harry's textbook? Why is Harry's enemy, Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), spending all his time away from class? He's not the same mean, confrontational boy he used to be; he's seething, withdrawn, and seemingly always on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Why is he guarded so closely by the brooding Severus Snape (Alan Rickman), who is this year's newest Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher?

The second part of the story: Harry and his best friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) are now sixteen years old, which is to say that they're in the thick of teen romances. Hermione is starting to have feelings for Ron, which is why she doesn't take kindly to Ron's new date, an infatuated young girl named Lavender Brown (Jessie Cave). At the same time, Hermione catches the eye of Gryffindor House's newest Quiddich player, a smug young man named Cormac McLaggen (Freddie Stroma). She, however, has absolutely no interest in him. As for Harry, the relationship that bloomed in ""Order of the Phoenix"" between him and Cho Chang has been pushed aside in favor of a relationship between him and Ron's sister, Ginny (Bonnie Wright).

As far as these characters go, I was most impressed with the way Hermione was developed. She's well on her way to womanhood, and as such, she's genuinely jealous of the attention Ron gives to Lavender. This is at times funny, as when she intentionally asks Cormac to a Christmas party. It's also at times surprisingly tender, as when she clings to Harry's arm, silently weeping. Emma Watson has always been good as Hermione, but her range has never been as far-reaching as it is in this film. The same can be said for Rupert Grint, especially during a scene in which he accidentally eats chocolates spiked with a powerful love potion.

The final act begins with Harry and Dumbledore visiting a seaside cave and having a frightening encounter with demon-like water creatures. It only goes downhill from there in terms of tone, and that brings me back to the ending. What an emotionally draining way to finish a ""Harry Potter"" film. Those who have not read J.K. Rowling's original novel may not be prepared for it. But even if that's the case, I can't in good conscience recommend that anyone avoid this film. ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" may be darker than its predecessors, but it's filled to the brim with style and imagination, and it reveals new dimensions to characters we've come to know and love. With only the seventh and eighth films left (the final book being split into two screenplays), we can begin the process of looking back and remembering how great an experience it has been.",1247616000,5,5374,4.87417943107221
3041699,5,B000ZECQ08,"Wide-eyed wonder, a sly sense of humor, a truly disturbing villain... this sixth installment in the Harry Potter series has all this plus a striking visual style. Although Potter newbies will be lost (the movie assumes you know what has gone before and who the characters are), Harry's fans will be thrilled.

The story is complex even for followers of the series. Headmaster Albus Dumbledore, after scolding Harry about being reckless over the summer for riding London subway trains, leads the young wizard on one dangerous adventure after another. The goal is to stop He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, the Dark Lord Voldemort, who is growing in power and murdering people both in and out of the magical world. The secret to stopping the Dark Lord lies with Professor Slughorn, who taught at Hogwarts when Voldemort was simply a student named Tom Riddle. Slughorn has a repressed memory that Harry must observe to understand how to destroy Voldemort. He observes by plunging his face into liquid memories in a glowing bowl called a Pensieve. (Well named, as a ""pensive"" person is quietly reflecting on a memory.)

When Dumbledore says ""That was fun!"" after performing a bit of magic, I agreed with him, and gave myself over to the story. In the last couple of Harry Potter movies, the characters' reaction to their magic has been sort of perfunctory and humdrum. In ""Half-Blood Prince"" the wonder -- and the fun -- is back.

Most of the humor comes from teenage romances, notably involving Harry's best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Grainger, and Ron's sister Ginny. Ron's misadventures with the smitten Lavender Brown -- and Hermione's reaction -- are funny and true-to-life. Ron complains to Harry that he must dump Lavender because of the non-stop kissing: ""My lips are getting chapped!"" And a conversation between the two boys about noticing who has nice skin -- Harry mentions Ginny's skin; Ron Hermione's -- is sweet, and revealing.

The considerable chills in ""Half-Blood Prince"" come courtesy of the evil Voldemort's birth in the young student Tom Riddle. When you first meet the boy in a memory, he is so strange, so creepy and odd, you have compassion for him. What awful thing must have happened to him to make him this way? Voldemort seems scarier here as a quietly evil student than as the freakish monster he turns into.

The cinematography is stunning. The coloring and lighting make scenes seem like works of art. Often the color is bleached from the screen, with only one item in color (usually red). Other shots are infused with silvery light, giving landscapes and objects an otherworldly look. Steep, angular camera angles make scenes dramatic and emotional. It's a visual feast.

One thing I didn't miss was the buffoonish Dursley family, Harry's adoptive relatives, who are absent in ""Half-Blood Prince."" All three seemed too much like cartoons for my taste. The new characters are much more fun, notably loopy Luna with her oddball fashion sense and boy-crazy Lavender Brown.

Give yourself plenty of time for this one: it clocks in at two and a half hours. When it's over, you'll be more than ready for Harry's last chapter.",1247616000,34,3144,4.965779467680608
3041700,4,B000ZECQ08,"Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) enlists Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) to get close to Professor Slughorn, the new Potions teacher. He believes that he has an important memory of Tom Riddle/Lord Voldemort and wants Harry to get it. A used potions book of someone named the Half Blood Prince helps Harry to impress Slughorn and get closer to him. But who's the Half Blood Prince ?

  While Hermione starts to show her true feelings for Ron when he starts dating someone. But he's too clueless to realize she's jealous. He also joins the Quiditch team, but he isn't as bad as he is in the book, but with some help from Harry and Hermione. Harry's last year of Quiditch isn't made into that much of a big deal in the movie as well. But what was done well in the movie is how Draco has a mission from the Dark Lord that Snape (Alan Rickman) has promised to help him with it. While Harry knows Draco is up to something which leads him into more than one confrontation with him.

  I loved the first half of the movie but once it got towards the end, it felt a bit rushed. The Deatheater's battle with Hogwart students from the book was left out when I was looking forward to it. While Bill Weasley I think was totally cut out of the movies. The drama between Persey and his family was also left out. I think the movies would have been stronger if didn't leave out such things though. I liked how the Weaseley mom didn't like Bill's future wife in the book, which led to a good moment in the end. Here, all that was totally left out.

  I liked a lot about the movie though. I originally said that the Harry and Ginny scenes could have been better. Now that I think about it, I loved the scene where Ginny runs to help Harry in a fight with Deatheaters. The flashbacks of Voldermort as a child were also good. While the director David Yates is good at handling the dark side of the story as well as the humor and magic. He's one of the better Potter directors even if he does cut out some things. A lot of people want Chris Columbus back for the last film but he's lucky if he's hired to do a made for dvd Home Alone sequel after doing (I Love You Beth Cooper). David Yates is fine, it's the scripts that just need a little bit more development, other than that he does a good job.",1247616000,2,2265,4.248837209302326
3041701,5,B000ZECQ08,"I was highly impressed and very relieved by my first viewing of Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince.  Impressed because the film is a fine adaptation of the book while relieved that the unfortunate skimping of detail which so marred Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was not as apparent.  The Harry Potter series is a rare exception to the rule that sequels are never as good as the originals.

Naturally any book with as many subplots and characters as Half Blood Prince cannot be completely transferred to film  Some things are cut, like the Dursleys, while others are added, as in an early scene showing Harry at a Muggle diner.  What was cut did not mar the story and the additions were mostly in keeping with the overall tone.  Dark times have come to the wizard world.  Voldemort is extending his power, and even Muggles recognize that dark forces are at work.  Harry is now recognized by his fellow wizards as The Chosen One, and as a typical 16 year old it has gone to his head a bit.  He is torn between his need to be a teenager dealing with his emotions and those of his friends and would be lovers and his inescapable fate as the nemesis of the Dark Lord.

In The Half Blood Prince we learn more about the early history of Lord Voldemort, and these scenes are among the best in the film, showing young Tom Riddle in a Muggle orphanage and later as the most gifted and troubled student at Hogwarts.  We get some hints of what is to come in the final Deathly Hallows movies, but not so much that those who have not yet read the last book will have that experience ruined.  Though the overall tone is dark, there are some supremely hilarious moments, mainly dealing with Harry, Ginny, Ron, and Hermione's personal lives, as well as a very well portrayed Horace Slughorn.  The returning cast members continue to do remarkable job and we get more insights into some of their characters, particularly those of Draco Malfoy and Severus Snape.

The film is greatly enhanced by its fine soundtrack, some of it carryovers from  earlier films (like the overall theme music) including a couple of my favorites from The Order of the Phoenix: Fireworks and Dumbledore's Army.",1247616000,5,2184,4.564102564102564
3041702,5,B000ZECQ08,"When one waits 16 hours in a line to ensure they get good seats to a movie, it'll have to be one darn good film that they are seeing to make it worth it. I can say without a shadow of a doubt that `Half-Blood Prince,' the latest installment in the insanely popular Harry Potter franchise, is one darn good movie and would have been worth another six hours at least.

A long time has passed since Harry and Co. sat around the Great Hall and played wizard chess while worrying about their exams.  As year six dawns for our young heroes, everything, including their beloved Hogwarts, has a dark and menacing existence. Even the muggles are beginning to feel the effects of the rising evil in the wizarding world.

And so begins Year 6.

`Half-Blood Prince' is, despite the times, far and away the funniest of the Potter films.  The excellent writing is sharp, and downright hilarious at times. Steve Kloves really did a wonderful job of balancing the screenplay with a perfect combination of wit and storytelling, the end result being a film that is perfectly paced with not a dull moment to speak of. Superb writing.

The acting is, across the board, near-perfect. The three young stars all shine in their respective rolls. Daniel Radcliffe plays well the reluctant yet determined hero. He also shows his comedic side in an insanely memorable scene featuring Felix Felicius, liquid luck. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, despite not playing as large a roll as Radcliffe, are also excellent. Grint's dead nuts tone and facial expressions absolutely make the awkward romances that permeate the story.  A run in with a love potion gives Grint an opportunity to prove his comedic talents, and, boy, does he deliver.  Watson, on the other hand, is possibly the most improved and probably the best.  She has gotten her eyebrows under control for this one and is charming as Hermione.  While hers is a more serious role, she comes through brilliantly as well, especially in an emotional scene in which she is very convincing.

Also, the supporting cast is phenomenal.  Michael Gambon is excellent as Dumbledore, and Jim Broadbent proves a worthy addition to the cast as Professor Slughorn, a professor returning to teach at Hogwarts.  Bonnie Wright, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, and Helena Bonham-Carter round off the wonderful cast. Special mention to Tom Felton, who steps up to a larger role as the conflicted Draco Malfoy and does a superb job.

By the time you near the end of this movie, you may have trouble believing how it will end. Sure, through the laughs, you learn bits and pieces of the dark and mysterious past of Voldemort, but so far it has not been extremely heavy. Then comes the last half hour, which is perhaps the best part of the film. As Harry and Dumbledore travel to a dark cave in search of a missing piece of Voldemort's past, the tone of the whole film changes dramatically.  This change is handled perfectly, and catapults the viewers to the shocking and ultimately sobering end.

I will admit, it has been a while since I read the novel upon which this film is based. That said, I cannot vouch completely for the quality of the adaption. I can, however, think of several things that were added or taken away, right off the top of my head. Unlike with some of the films, however, these changes seem completely natural and irreprehensible.  I felt that the changes were handled well and for the bettering of the film and the franchise. To watch it without comparing it strictly to the book is how, ultimately, this film will be enjoyed fully.

One such change, at the end, is a funeral that has been removed from the film.  In it's place, however, is a wonderful sentiment by the teachers and students of Hogwarts that is an extremely emotional and a stirring symbolism. Just as the end of the book, it brought tears to my eyes. While it was different from the book, it was still extremely effective, and brought the heart of the novel to the screen.

The very last scene, in which Harry, Ron and Hermione discuss what will happen going forward, speaks to them as well as the audience. Nothing will be the same. They know that everything they have done to this point has been leading up to an epic climax that will decide the fate of the world. Just so, the audience not only sees, but FEELS the epic battle that is looming. And as Harry aptly observes of the school that will never be the same: ""I'm just beginning to realize how beautiful this is.""

The same could be said of the Harry Potter franchise.",1247616000,6,4521,4.640350877192983
3041703,4,B000ZECQ08,"Warner Bros. delayed film version of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince ...it was worth the wait. J.K.Rowling's young wizard enters into his last full year of attending Hogwarts...I initially described the Half-Blood Prince novel as having a distinct post-911 feel to it...as does it's film counterpart...the Dark Lord is back to full strength (as seen in his battle with Dumbledore at the climax of ""Order of the Phoenix""), the wizarding world is now privy to the knowledge of this return and it is a very different place, than it was when we first met Harry back in the Sorcerer's Stone. There is an gloomy atmosphere of fear and foreboding evident even in the brief moments we see of the Muggle's perspective, in an early scene in which Harry reads of disasters impacting both worlds. Even the familiar Diagon Alley is ...well unfamiliar, shopkeepers packed and gone or worst , as we see wandmaker Ollivander abducted following the destruction of his shop ....the only wand casting ""lumos"" on this darkened new world the Weasley twins Joke shop, alas, all too brief. New concepts, like apparitions, Felix Felicis and Horcruxes are introduced and old ones like the memory exposition vehicle of the pensive return to great effect. Also returning is the Director of ""Order of the Phoenix"" David Yates who does a fine job giving the material a real world connection opening with attacks in London. Yates focuses on more matters of heart than any Potter film to date, not just the love potions and love interests. But, Harry and Dumbledore's connection, the bonds of family via the Weasleys, Draco's angst-filled moments all come alive. Yates' vision of Quidditch is the finest yet seen, here the wizard sport really feels like, well, a sport...bone crunching blocks and offensive plays! Great comedic moments, with Ron especially, truly scary moments with Voldemort's undead guardians and the curse-attack Katie Bell, made my hair stand on end (and her's). This is the most adult outing yet for the francise, not just the boy/girl issues of adolescent, but the cast has never been more comfortable in their roles...Ginny sure has come along way...and go re-watch the young neophyte Harry in Sorcerer's Stone if you doubt that.

Like many of the Potter stories/film this one contains it's share of exposition and flashback, but like it's predecessors , unique methods of delivering these ""flashbacks"" are used...this time we get the origin of the Dark Lord Voldemort via Dumbledore's visit to an orphanage to meet his future Nemesis. In addition to this, other answers are given as to how Tom Riddle became the seemingly immortal ""He who must not be named"" and what Harry must do to face him....the beginning of Harry's quest to defeat Voldemort. In addition to this, attacks on students begin and Hogwarts is (again) unsafe, but who is the real target...who is this assassin?. Meanwhile, love is in the air and candies, as Harry only belatedly realizes his would be truelove,...and Ron is still a mess, only this time with imbibed love potion.

Fortunately for the filmmakers ...the cast of the series has aged well and each has grown up to be attractive or at least interesting-looking (Daniel Radcliffe, Bonnie Wright, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint),recasting would have be unfortunate, so we don't really need to suspend disbelief to the level of say Frankie and Annette in a Beach flick, everyone young enough for the big screen vision of the books. Among the returning cast is Tom Felton a Harry's school nemesis Draco Malfoy, given so much more to work with in this one Felton is growing worthy of the adult veterans he shares scenes with (namely Alan Rickman terrifically cast as Prof. Snape)... Dumbledore is again Michael Gambon, who replace the late great Richard Harris, Gambon is much better in this feature than in previous films, but I feel the emotional content greatly diminished by his presence instead of his predecessor, Evanna Lynch again makes with the scene stealing as Luna Lovegood (who replaces the Tonks character for early scenes, to greater effect than the original text), Bellatrix Lestrange  played so wonderfully wicked by Helena Bonham Carter that a completely original  sequence is added at the Burrow.. as some old roles are expanded others are reduced, like scenes with Draco's sidekicks Crabbe & Goyle as little girls, most unfortunately Neville Longbottom has maybe one line...considering his importance to the final moments of the final installment I fear even this will be cut....absent entirely are Harry's horrible non-wizard kin the Dursleys (shame to as the scene with Dumbledore berating their abuse would have been great to see come to screen). New to the series Jim Broadbent's DELIGHTFUL Professor Slughorn this installment's obligatory new teacher to Hogwarts, also new and satisfyingly chilling to watch is Hero Fienn Tiffin as an 11-year-old Tom Riddle in a flashbacks, who is the real nephew of Ralph Fiennes, who plays the adult Voldemort, who is absent from ""Half-blood Prince"" physically, but he's presence surely has weight that is felt in nearly every scene as Dumbledore preps Harry for his final battle with the Dark Lord. Lines about Harry's blood being more precious than his own, really take this notion home.

Overall: ""HALF-BLOOD"" is a way, WAAY abridged and jazzed up Hollywood version of the book for the screen....in many ways better than any of the series to date. The perfect balance of comedy, horror and action that makes the HP films successful...so to the cast and crew I say ""Mischief managed!""

If you have read the book and want to know what was cut and what wasn't......OTHERWISE DON'T READ ON ....SPOILERS BELOW...

The Other Minister and recap of over 5 years of book exposition and  intro to the new Minister of Magic Scrimgeour replaces Fudge...yep it was cut.

Snape Takes the Unbreakable oath to protect Draco on his mission for the Dark Lord...the unedited version is another 5 year (plus) explanation of why he didn't kill Harry and why he is still Voldemort's most faithful servant....this is edited, but kept.

Harry & the Dursley's ....Dumbledore's visit to Privot Drive...exposition on Harry as heir to his Godfather's estate/ the Order's HQ and house elf  Kreacher (who's important to the 7th Book)....also cut, replaced with ""Harry at a Diner flirting with a waitress""...strange.

Harry and Dumbledore's stop over recruitment of Slughorn, is interesting for revealing the atmosphere in the wizarding world as they find the would be Professor hiding out, fearing for his life. I figured this would be cut....but they kept it...rounding out Slughorn nicely.

Things go a lot faster after reaching the Burrow...Wedding subplot? No. Lots less Tonks and no Fleur, thankfully...added at the Burrow is a Xmas action sequence...instead of Harry's confrontation with the new Minister, makes sense, but sort of eliminates the need for the Wedding attack in HP7, or a wedding at all without Bill or Fleur.

Trip to Diagon Alley still includes Joke Shop (didn't seeU-NO-POO?), like a mentioned before, and Malfoy is tailed without any confrontation as clues to his destiny are given in Knockturn Alley..

Trouble on the Hogwarts express is kept, while the Slughorn ""meet and greet"" is altered.
Tonks is cut and swapped out for Luna, which I like better, the Tonks / Lupin stuff in the book seems too contrived, even more so than Harry.

Harry gets his used Textbook, care of the Half-Blood Prince load with tips, ...becomes a potion expert, but the Prince's Levicorpus spell does not appear the film (odd cause it is in the tie-in game), Sectumsempra is as we see when Harry fights Draco again, hides the book, with help from Ginny as a vehicle for their moment alone...

Harry and Dumbledore's private lessons and flashbacks happen minus the story of Voldemort's mother? Both versions of Slughorn's memory, too.

Aragog's funeral is included, while Harry is on ""Luck"" but the closing Funeral of the story isn't included...we do see poor ole Fawkes, fly off into the setting sun.",1247616000,3,8056,5.039819684447783
3041704,1,B000ZECQ08,"Please know there will be SPOILERS in this review regarding the book and the movie versions of the Half-Blood Prince.

I left this movie feeling the most disappointed in any book to movie adaptation I have ever seen in a film.  Many of the past Potter films have left out or reworked parts of the book that really bothered me, but not as much as this film did.  One of my two major issues with this film, and there are many smaller ones, is that there was NO BATTLE at the school!!!  The death eaters waltz in, kill the headmaster, and waltz out??!?!  Are you kidding me?  All the work of the D.A., not the mention the school defenses, and they don't even notice that these guys are blasting out windows, blowing up rooms, and killing their headmaster???  Harry isn't even immobilized by Dumbledore as he is in the book during the death scene, which prevents Harry from coming to his defense.  Instead they make out Harry to be a WIMP who stands around pacing while they kill his beloved headmaster.  Harry would have gotten himself killed in Dumbledore's defense if he had a chance...which was why the headmaster immobilized him with a spell to prevent that from happening!  They didn't even let poor Harry stun a single death eater during the entire chase off the school grounds.  In the book both Harry, his friends, and teachers put up a major fight.  Where was Bill Weasley who was brutally attacked, and Lupin and Tonks who also fought for the school?  A death eater was killed if my memory serves me right!  Harry left Ron, Hermione, and Ginny some of the luck potion, which is what protected them during the battle.  I could go on and on... but onto my next big beef with this film.

They completely skip the funeral!!!! Unbelievable, one of the most important characters dies and they just end the movie!  Why was everyone so calm at the sight of their dead headmaster?  I remember people in the book beside themselves with the pain of his loss.  And why on earth in all of the most emotional scenes do I never see a single tear drop down Daniel Radcliffe's face?  I swear his emotional scenes were completely lacking for me.  I wanted to see a real heart wrenching performance like I felt when reading the book.  And don't even get me started on how they gypped poor Fawkes....

A couple other things...Since when can Dumbledore apparate right into the school?  In the book he had to appear in Hogsmead on his return from the horcrux scene and TRAVEL to the school which already had the dark mark above it....ugh!!  Where on earth was Doby or Kreacher in this film? Considering what happens in the next book/film I think an appearance of Doby would have been justified.  These changes they made were simply unnecessary and serve no purpose other than to make the final film a joke with so much information incorrect or not covered.

I have put up with a lot adaptations from the books to the movies that were grossly changed, but this was simply unacceptable.  The battle they skipped over was extremely important and by skipping over it, and the funeral, they did a great disservice to the memory of Dumbledore.  Those scenes were extremely powerful and they turned it into something rated G (gutless) and ruined the film IMO.  At least an hour of all of the endless focus on the romance in this film could have been cut out to add more of the guts of the book onto the big screen.

The only shining light for me is Evanna Lynch who plays Luna.  I wish I had seen more of her in the film because I love the way she portrays Luna's character, who was one of my favorites from the books.  Oh...and I can't forget Warwick Davis whose character of Filius Flitwick I always look forward to seeing.

I didn't feel there was as much action and suspense that I felt there should be.  The movie is good but not the best of the HP series.  I felt that they dealt too much with the romances and not as much with how they thought was the Half Blood Prince.

  She has done so in each book. No director, or writer should alter this ladies passionate excellence. Let the story be the story and tell it true to the book.

Probably too afraid.  If you read these books you see themes of friendship, loyalty, honesty, compassion for others, persisting against obstacles, standing up for what is right & good, fighting evil, sacrificing self for others, so many admirable themes I can't even list them all.

3273875,3,B000ZECQ08,"""The Half Blood Prince"" should be called ""The Half Cocked Film."" Books aside, the film leaps, jumps and bounces about from darkness to glee in artistic, engaging and dramatically potent form, but in the end may leave the viewer scratching their heads.

Fans of the books KNOW what's going on, moviegoers may be a bit confused as the why things happen. For one, the film opens with Ginny and Harry madly in unspoken love as Ginny snogs Dean Thomas anyway, and Hermione is suddenly infatuated with Ron - sure, there has been tension between hem since puberty, but jealousy seems a bit of a stretch all of a sudden (in the books it's more of a slow brewing issue.)

Without too many spoilers, ask yourself: how and why does Harry know what and for what use a Beazor is and why does his potions master (not Snape now) sit and watch a student die when the solution should be clear to him? Why is there no defenses at the Weasely house if they are in dire danger, why no Order members standing guard, no spells around the property and why do the Death Eaters attack? (hint, it's not in the book at all!!! so there's no answer.) Why does Dumbledore take Harry to the Burrow at the beginning of the film (it makes sense in the book, here, no reason.) Why does Harry take orders from Snape at the end without question? Why does no one challenge four Death Eaters running amok in Hogwarts and setting Hagrid's hut ablaze?

The movie is fast, humorous, entertaining and a wonder to watch, both emotionally and visually. I buy the characters, the motivations, the special effects, everything almost... just not the logical flaws that made me scratch my head all the way home.

 I do hope they shot a lot of scenes that will someday make up an extended DVD /  Blu-Ray version. The film is so close to being the perfect Potter film, but forgets the audience isn't stupid.",1218844800,15,1857,4.4955489614243325

3273901,4,B000ZECQ08,"Superb.

There is a saying,""It's always darkest before the dawn."" In this case the darkness is about to fall. Harry Potter in the last film has incurred a great triumph but at the same time a terrible loss. The wizarding world is no longer living in denial that Lord Voldemort has returned. Voldemort has been denied the knowledge of his prophesied demise and many of his loyal subjects are imprisoned. Harry however has lost family, incurred great pain and now faces the future with more uncertainty.

But life goes on and Harry is reunited with friends and with his cherished life at Hogwarts as Professor Dumbledore begins to teach Harry in something far more vital that schoolwork - the demise of Voldemort. Memories into Dumbledore and Voldemort's past are leading to a secret truth that Harry must find from a brand new professor. All the while various occurrences caused by Voldemort's Death Eaters as well as a mysterious plot that Harry suspects from old rivalries may actually be more than he thinks.

The movie ends with truths revealed as well as terrible tragedies. Still, its a great story, leading up to the final chapters in the Harry Potter saga. I also particularly enjoy stories that reveal more about the villain. I definitely enjoy the Voldemort flashbacks. Though much was missing from the books that could have made it even better.

This movie was great on Blu-Ray and I'm glad I purchased it in time before Warner Bros. stopped giving away its free iTunes Digital Copy. B+",1517529600,,1496,4.83203125

Of all the Harry Potter movies I've watched thus far, I've enjoyed this the most.  It's a dark - physically and mentally - movie.

Harry discovers a spell book previously owned by ""Half-Blood Prince"".  We find out later who that is be a confession.  This book has ""updated"" spells with notes in the margins.  We find out a few new relationships between ""You-Know-Who"" and other characters in the series.  This isn't your feel-good movie.  This delves deeply into the mythology of the series.

3274036,5,B000ZECQ08,"""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" is the set-up to the ""Deathly Hallows"", the two-part finale of the series.  Lord Voldemort and his minions are slowly closing the ring on Harry and his friends and allies.  Even Hogwarts is no longer safe, as it becomes clear there are traitors within the walls.  Harry and Professor Dumbledore will follow a string of clues in the hunt for an ancient memory that may represent Voldemort's vulnerability.  That trail takes Harry and his allies into some very dark country; not all will survive the journey.  And who is the Half-Blood Prince?

The darkness in this movie is delightfully relieved by the happy fact that our favorite Hogwarts students are now teenagers, and in the full throes of the normal hormonal storm.  Friendships will be tested and new relationships formed.  The odd but goodhearted Luna Lovegood will be a friend in need to Harry.  Ron Weasley's younger sister Ginny comes into her own as a witch and as an ally of the trio.  Ron Weasley will discover the dangers of mixing magic and romance.  Hermione will learn to share what she holds most dear, in unexpected ways.

The special effects and the pacing of the movie are excellent.  The location shooting in Scotland is almost distractingly good.  A stream of good actors continue to fill up the screen with good performances.  Very highly recommended to fans of the series.",1485820800,,1388,4.846808510638298

They really don't develop her character well in the films she is such a better character in the books.

Ok, I know it is a play and written that way, but I still was left wanting more detail and in-depth character development.  This book actually could have been two books (maybe more).  The story was too much like a sitcom (you've got  24 minutes to set the story and come to a conclusion); neat and clean and the conclusion seemed forced like they had to finish it to meet a time frame.  (Yea, I know, it's a play stupid, they do have a set time frame to fit it in).  Harry and the rest are like family and the introduction to their children was just too brief.  Like going to a family reunion and only being able to meet the new members of the family for  5 minutes and then having to leave.
Can't wait to compare the actual play to the book though.

3274341,2,B000ZECQ08,"An acceptable ""bridge"" episode (you know this is primarily serving to bridge to the climactic final film) but ultimately it was just pretty dull.  Feels like Harry is moping around the castle most of the time or stalking Draco (and how exactly did he get away with not being punished for sending a bloody laceration spell against Draco and leaving him bleeding to death, as Snape was standing there watching?)  And much like in the book, I was left puzzled by many of Gandalf, I mean, Dumbledore's actions through the film.  For instance, when seeking out a horcrux in a creepy dark ocean cave, perhaps you should, I don't know, bring along a few other experienced wizards as well? If the problem involved drinking stinky old water wouldn't it have made sense to bring along Snape, the potions master, to help reverse the effects?)
I will say that I liked the character of Horace Slughorn and thought he was an enjoyable addition to the series. In fact, his character and mannerism struck me that he's make a fantastic Doctor Who, but that will probably never happen.
Dumbledore's funeral was brief and anticlimactic. I felt the book did a lot more justice to this than a brief ""everyone lift your wand"" gimmick.",1459900800,,1212,4.734597156398104

Even my 11 year old Grandson kept saying that's not the way it happened Gram or why did they have that person do that, what happened to such and such. They left out way too much that leads to the final showdown with voldimort and added in stuff that was so unnecessary as to be ridiculous. It was extremely over acted and the Lavendar Brown character was just plain sickening to watch. This one was poorly directed and the changes they made, made absolutely no sense. I bought it only to have it with the rest of the set. The others I can watch over and over, not this one. The first 2 movies were my favorites'",1454284800,,739,4.24822695035461

3274447,3,B000ZECQ08,"The film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, the sixth in the franchise, follows the lead of the titular installment in the Potter book series by focusing not on Harrys academic life but on his nonacademic pursuits yet fail to convey the importance of items and set the stage for franchises final installments as well as add and remove too much.

Though those in charge of production and direction claim Half-Blood Prince was boiled down to the essential plot and foreshadowing elements needed for future films likes its three predecessors it is untrue.  Throughout the film, as well as in the books, there are two main subplots the revelations of the Voldemorts Horcruxes and Draco Malfoys mission and while the latter was handled perfectly the former was botched with missing scenes that impact future installments.  The addition of Jim Broadbent to the cast as Professor Horace Slughorn was a brilliant selection and the Slughorn secondary plot was handled properly in context to the overall Horcrux discovery.  The climactic scene in the Astronomy Tower between Dumbledore, Draco, and Snape with Harry watching was brilliantly acted and portrayed making it one of the few highlights of the overall film.

Aside from the edition of Broadbent there were no other major cast additions, the younger cast members performed admirably with the material they were given which is not a slight on them but of the script. Of the older returning cast members of the cast both Michael Gambons Dumbledore and Alan Rickmans Severus Snape were excellent given either their primary or major impactful roles in this particular film.

The sixth installment of the Harry Potter franchise is an uneven film, and in my opinion worse than Goblet of Fire.  My assessment of this film for a non-book reader is that they would find the film incomprehensible as to everything going on, while book readers would question why important scenes were ignored in the Horcrux subplot that would be relevant in the Deathly Hallows along with the inclusion of new scenes that did nothing but try to be different from the book.  In all honestly, I would rate this film 2  stars instead of 3 if I had the option.",1450569600,,2196,4.945652173913044

Especially when said final battle could not have been a bigger disappointment. Reading both scenes I was on an emotional roller coaster with such high stakes for characters that readers have seen slowly develop.  The battle of Helms Deep in no way took away from the final battle in LOTR, and that was only 3 films.

3274503,4,B000ZECQ08,"While I enjoy these film adaptations, I want to highly recommend you read the novels first. While the film's are done very well, each novel is filled with such rich detail, you can't help but lose quite a bit of magic in transition from page to screen. Specifically starting with the third novel, ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" and through the end of the series, so much is trimmed for the purpose of the film running time, that whole chunks of story and sometimes even great characters and character development never makes it to the screen.

Harry is returning to his 6th year at Hogwarts, but after the events in ""The Order of the Phoenix"", he finds himself a bigger celebrity than ever. Voldemort is gaining more power and his Death Eaters are bringing havoc to not lonely the Wizarding world, but causing harm to the muggle world as well, killing or kidnapping anyone that gets in their way. Harry, Ron and Hermione suspect that Draco Malfoy has joined the Death Eaters, and suspect that he is plotting with the Dark Lord to overthrow Hogwarts.

I will say that this film seems to change the most from the source material. Yes the basic storyline is the same, but tons of details are swapped around. For instance in the novel, Dumbledore warns Harry against being ""collected"" by Professor Slughorn, when in the film it's said that Dumbledore wants Harry to become part of the ""Slug Club"". Sure it's a small detail, but it the shift changes the characters, and their actions, quite a bit from the page to the screen. There are similar changes throughout the telling of this story, with some fantastic character development surrounding Voldemort that is completely left. out.

This film seems much darker in tone, even in the way it's shot, there are no sweeping shots of the castle or grounds. When Hogwarts is shown,  it's usually in the dark or the sky is murky cloudy. The wonderous, magical quality is toned way down in the film, so that instead of fantasy, you feel uneasy about what has happened in Harry's world. A good film, but bit more morose and melancholy than what's come before it.",1443398400,,2094,4.682065217391305

3274616,4,B000ZECQ08,"Count this installment as yet another transition in the series, a stepping stone or segue from one episode to the next in the continuing saga of the young wizard.  ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,"" the 2009 movie adaptation of J.K. Rowlings's novel, is the next-to-last chapter in the seven-book series but is the sixth movie in a succession of eight, with the seventh book taking up the final two films.  Here in this ""Ultimate Edition"" box set, we have ""The Half-Blood Prince"" in Blu-ray high definition, decked out with an array of new special features.

Although ""The Half-Blood Prince"" is hardly a stand-alone movie as some in the series have been, it is, nevertheless, among the more enjoyable, placing its emphasis not purely on action or adventure but on characterizations and interrelationships.  As such, it is a more mature film than many of the others and a more satisfying one, at least for viewers who respect and appreciate thought and emotion over dynamite thrills.  Be aware, however, that it is also among the darkest installments in the series so far, and as such it isn't quite the high-definition feast for the eyes that some earlier episodes have been.  Still, it looks quite good, with a lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack to match.

Suggesting that ""The Half-Blood Prince"" is a transitional story is not, however, to say it is without its unique twists and revelations.  Indeed, it is the sometimes startling, sometimes poignant new developments that keep the story going:  the circumstances regarding Professor Snape, Professor Dumbledore, Ron Weasley, Ginny Weasley, and Harry himself.  They are often quite surprising circumstances, actually, and the plot uses them to set us up the final two-part segment to come, the climax of the entire saga, ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.""

British director David Yates, who not only directed this film but ""The Order of the Phoenix"" and both installments of ""The Deathly Hallows,"" seems more interested in building mood, atmosphere, and character relationships than in continually hitting the viewer over the head with exciting exploits and whizbang special effects.  For the die-hard action fan, this may be a shortcoming of the Yates installments; for fans of the novels, it may be a major strength.  ""The Half-Blood Prince"" might move along more casually, more leisurely, than some episodes in the series, but in the long run it rewards the viewer with more information and more-satisfying interconnections among the principal players.

We get most of the usual cast back, so I need not mention them again or who is playing whom.  The only new character of interest is Professor Horace Slughorn, played by the ever-dependable Jim Broadbent, who seems to be making a career of playing older, slightly eccentric professor types lately, and doing it nicely (""Harry Potter,"" ""Chronicles of Narnia,"" ""Indiana Jones,"" ""Inkheart"").

OK, here's the rundown:  Voldemort is becoming more powerful than ever, and Hogworts has become a virtual fortress, with guards at the gates and magic spells protecting the perimeter against Deatheaters and Dementors.  Dumbledore has recruited Professor Slughorn ostensibly to teach the potions class at Hogworts, but it's actually because Slughorn knows something about Voldemort that can help to defeat him, and Dumbledore wants Harry to help find it out.  Simultaneously, we learn at the very beginning of the tale that Dumbledore has promoted Professor Snape, always a dubious character, to Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher.  We also learn that Snape is involved in possibly nefarious dealings with the maniacal Bellatrix Lestrange and the mother of the odious Draco Malfoy to protect Draco from harm and ensure the boy carries out some undisclosed evil deed.  Meanwhile, amidst these malevolent goings-on Harry and his friends Ron, Hermione, and Ginny are experiencing growing pains as love blossoms at the school, and they must each determine who they really like.

In addition to all of this, Harry finds a textbook in advanced potions-making containing answers to complex spells written in the margin by one of the book's previous owners of long ago, a mysterious person who signed the book only ""The Half-Blood Prince.""  What's all that about?  We must wait to find out.

Then there's the introduction late in the proceedings of an obscure and powerful piece of magical property known as a Horcrux, a device used by Dark Wizards to extend life even unto immortality.  More sinister yet, Lord Voldemort has apparently hidden away a number of these Horcruxes, which, if he reacquires them, will enable him to become the most-powerful Wizard on the planet, with the goal of conquering the world.  Poor Harry.  So little time; so much to do.

""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" is at least as dark and foreboding as ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" and ""The Order of the Phoenix,"" yet, thankfully (and perhaps ironically), it also contains a good deal more humor, more sweet friendships, and more warm character illuminations than the others.  Parts of ""The Half-Blood Prince"" are more elaborately embroidered, too, more dramatically illustrated, than in the novel--like the segment's ending, to be sure--but for the most part we get a deliberately paced, measured view of the characters, their motivations, and their relationships as they march onward toward the saga's conclusion.

Along the way, we get one of the longest yet most-delightfully entertaining installments in the ""Harry Potter"" series.

Video:
Understand, this is an extremely dark film, one of the darkest films yet in the ""Potter"" series, and as such it has a darkly wrought appearance.  The WB video engineers use a dual-layer BD50 and a VC-1 codec to reproduce the film in its theatrical aspect ratio, 2.40:1, capturing the  gloomy duskiness of the original print pretty well, insofar as I remember it from a movie theater, with healthy black levels and good shadow detail.  The filmmakers shot a majority of the film at nighttime (or simulated nighttime), in simulated storms, and in simulated shadowy passageways, so don't expect the usual, bright visual delights.  Nevertheless, there is good definition throughout, even though the film varies in sharpness from scene to scene from somewhat soft in some parts to beautifully crisp in others.  Different cameras, different lenses, different lighting, different bit rates, etc., produce different results.

In terms of the technical qualities of the Blu-ray 1080p transfer, it's probably as good as it can be, with no signs of edge enhancement, noise or noise filtering, pixilation, color banding, or the like.  While the image doesn't always look great in its near-monotone shades of grays, blues, greens, and sepia browns, it appears to be the way its creators meant it to look.

Audio:
The soundtrack comes via lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, and it is more subtle than you might expect from a ""Potter"" extravaganza, most likely because this is not a usual ""Potter"" extravaganza.  Complementing the nuances of the plot and characterizations, the soundtrack uses the surrounds with delicacy, introducing small, unobtrusive noises into the sound design like the twitter of birds, the creaking of antique objects, and the breeze through the castle towers, accompanied by an attractive musical bloom in composer Nicholas Hooper's score.  The advantage of the lossless track comes across in the midrange, which is smooth and natural, and the bass, which is bold, taut, and robust.  In all, the DTS-HD Master Audio provides refined, evocative sound.

Extras:
Disc one of this two-disc ""Ultimate Edition"" Blu-ray set contains the feature film and a ""Maximum Movie Mode,"" with picture-in-picture commentary from Daniel Radcliffe and many of the cast and crew as they take us behind the scenes while we watch the movie; plus, there's a series of ""Focus Points,"" fourteen brief featurettes that one can view either during the ""Maximum Movie Mode"" or separately.

In addition, the first disc contains thirty scene selections; BD-Live access; English, English descriptive narrative, French, German, Spanish, Dutch, and Portuguese spoken languages; French, Spanish, Dutch, and Portuguese subtitles; and English and German captions for the hearing impaired.

Disc two is also a Blu-ray (BD25) and contains the majority of the special features.  First up is ""Creating the World of Harry Potter, Part 6:  Magical Effects.""  It's sixty-four minutes long and takes us behind the scenes of the special effects in the series with commentary from the cast and crew.

Next is another featurette on special effects, ""Behind the Magic,"" about forty-seven minutes.  Then, there are ""J.K. Rowling:  A Year in the Life,"" about fifty minutes on the author, with spoilers; ""Close-up with the Cast of Harry Potter,"" eight segments with the cast and filmmakers totaling about twenty-eight minutes; ""One-Minute Drills,"" seven minutes with the young actors recalling their roles in the plot; ""What's on Your Mind?,"" about six minutes of questions and answers with the cast; ""The Wizarding World of Harry Potter,"" about eleven minutes on the Universal Orlando Resort; ""First Footage from Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,"" about two minutes promoting the final installments; eight additional scenes at about seven minutes; and five interstitials, one teaser trailer, and three theatrical trailers.

Lastly, because this is an ""Ultimate Edition,"" there are the usual collectibles: a beautifully illustrated, forty-four-page, hardbound book; an attractive lenticular picture; two limited-edition cards:  Draco Malfoy and Albus Dumbledore; and instructions and code for a downloadable digital copy of the film (the offer expiring on June 12, 2012).  Everything comes enclosed in a handsomely embossed, hard-cardboard box, further enclosed in a hard-cardboard slipcover (with the detachable lenticular picture on the front).

Parting Thoughts:
While the movie's only shortcoming is its extreme length, 153 minutes, that may also be a strength for those viewers who value getting their money's worth, especially when it means enjoying the high-definition picture and sound more.  And there is no question the two-and-a-half hours go by entertainingly enough, making ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" one of the most affecting episodes in the ""Potter"" series.  With its powerfully impassioned ending, ""The Half-Blood Prince"" leads Harry and his friends into the greatest adventure of them all in the final segments.",1433548800,,10542,5.3124623720650215

3274722,5,B000ZECQ08,"Seems after his MESS of OOTP, David Yates must have gotten a LOT of hate mail so he redeemed himself a bit. This one is a better adaption of a book and finally longer. About as long as the first film. I actually like the movie better than the book. I feel the book was poorly written, dragged out with mindless detail and Harry, Ron and Hermione were out of character. But in the movie it doesn't drag out.

The movie is indeed dark, but it is supposed to be. There are hilarious scenes involving teen romance and such. I think the reason this movie and book gets hate is because of who dies at the end.

But when I compare this to OOTP, its a NICE refresh and a really good movie.",1423612800,,681,4.112781954887218

3274828,4,B000ZECQ08,"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince

Can you remember the Superman films?  Can you remember how tired they got and how quickly?  It is outstandingly difficult to maintain a franchise.  The characters do what they can and are finished.  The special effects no longer dazzle.  The whole enterprise just slowly deflates and is seen no more.  This is the sixth in the Harry Potter series.  One hopes for the best.
 And one gets it.  Part of the reason is that we are dealing with young actors.  We get to actually watch them grow up physically on the big screen.  The big reason that this Harry Potter effort holds our interest is that it is so different from the others.  There are no scary three headed dogs or body snatching trees.  The magic in the magic world is now taken totally for granted, just part of the back drop.  The focus is on the two plots, one of the dangerous Dark Lord and his evil minions and the other revolves around-what else with teenagers?-romance.
 I expected a fast action adventure and was delighted to discover the slow, careful unfolding of a drama.  Brilliant, in the words of the Brit players.  I greeted the characters like cousins at a family reunion.  They all have bits of story to tell me, and as they become older the stories become more mature and interesting.
 This film runs a good Moneys worth 2hours and 33 minutes.  It has a PG rating but there is no bad language or nudity.  Alan Rickman is measured and subtle as the chief bad guy, a bravo performance.
 World wide, Potter fans are flocking to the film.  The three and a half saw blade movie has already plucked $400 million from movie goers around the globe.  I must now wait for the next Potter film.  I am eager.",1414454400,,1712,4.459546925566343

3274907,3,B000ZECQ08,"This is one of my favorite Harry Potter books. The movie is good but it loses 2 stars because I don't like how they changed parts of the story line unnecessarily. In not opinion, it really takes away from the story. I understand the need to trim things to make it fit in the alloted time, but why change an event completely? For instance, Harry and Jenny's relationship was glossed over and anticlimactic in the end as if an afterthought. Would it have really taken so much to bring them together the way J.K. wrote it? Yet, Ron and Lavender and the dynamic b/t Ron and Hermione was well done. Why cut out Bill and Fleur's engagement, That could have been worked in without adding scenes. There were some other instances as well. It's definitely worth watching, but I was disappointed with some of the choices they made this time around. If you can, read the book too.",1408579200,,868,4.5

This, in and of itself probably is not an issue if the story was so jam-packed and meddled.  Seriously, half the time I don't understand what's happening even though I read the book and I remember the details from it very clearly.  It really is not all that engaging because of it.  One saving grace though, is a character Luna Lovegood.  Luna cuts out distinctively 3-dimensional persona against a backdrop of flat, predictable, and slightly boring characters.",1407196800,,656,4.821428571428571

The shocking conclusion - it still shocks me, no matter how many times I have seen the movie - puts his feet back on the ground.

It never totally froze but it was jerky and slow. It wasn't unwatchable, but it definitely hurt the viewing experience.

To amazon's credit, I got an email about a week later saying that they recognized the quality had been poor and refunded me my money. That was nice and very much appreciated, considering I didn't send any kind of complaint, so maybe they were experiencing some kind of technical trouble that weekend, but it was one of two movies I downloaded with the same kind of experience and I wasn't refunded for the other one.",1395273600,,696,4.4375

3275021,5,B000ZECQ08,"Easily my favorite of all eight movies.

LOVE the Harry Potter series. Never thought I'd say that, being the Christian girl who wrote a scathing paper on the evils of Harry Potter, promoting the occult to youth and blah, blah, blah. I read over that paper I ACTUALLY SUBMITTED TO A COLLEGE PROFESSOR and wanted to go back in time and slap that girl into reality.

A Potterhead friend practically begged me to give the series a chance, and it is easily my favorite book series, next to Chronicles of Narnia. I am awaiting the day my 19 month old son is ready for me to read chapter books with him; because this will be our first! The tale woven throughout each of the seven books (eight movies) is one of true, genuine, sacrifical, loving friendship, not only standing up but also FIGHTING for what you believe in (especially when that belief is on the side of good), wins and losses and giving everything you have because it's the right thing to do. I just cannot praise these books enough. If you're on the fence about whether or not you'd want to bother with a ""young adult/kid"" series... just stop. Crack open a used (but very loved) copy of Sorcerer's Stone and GET. SWEPT. UP. in one of the greatest stories of bravery and perseverance and love and --geez, I should stop-- LIFE ever told. Or watch the first movie. And then the second... and all the rest.

Of course I do still recommend reading the books, before or after seeing the movies, because I still think the book is better than the movie.  But for a younger kid who might not have the patience (or ability) to read the book, your options are (a) read the book to the kid or (b) let it watch the movie until it's old enough to read the book.

However, the most important parts of this book was the background information on Tom Riddle, which is unfortunately barely touched on; there's more reasons to fear He-Who-Should-Not-Be-Named than just a missing nose, and the movie failed to deliver.
From my own personal prejudice: I love the storyline between Harry and Ginny, and the movie goes entirely off-script.  In the movie, their first kiss is alone and in private; in the book, it's in public with everyone watching.  Long live the bold and gorgeous Ginny Weasley.",1383091200,,796,5.061068702290076

3275171,5,B000ZECQ08,"When our grandkids started reading the Harry Potter books I became concerned but put it off and off.  I had found the Hobbit to be dumb until I reread it two more times and finally understood where that author was coming from....that only a Hobbit could turn away from temptation.  Then I endured the entire violent Rings thing.  Well. Okay.

Then I read about this woman who has hard times and writes this stuff about this ordinary boy.  Boy.  Ordinary.  So any kid can identify with him.  Hmmm.

Then I read the books.  Then my husband read the books.  Then we read the books aloud to each other...AGAIN! and AGAIN.
How could anyone create this stuff, even if it did seem as though we had read most of the things in someone else's writing first.  And tears ""leaking from his eyes""  repeatedly used....not artful  But, oh, my gosh, how exquisite, how gripping.
And then out come the movies with these precious kids and these superb adult actors that we often later see in something like Stephen Sondheim's later version of Sweeney Todd:  The Demon of Fleet Street.  What talent.

What direction.  The only criticism would be that the later movies do not have directors insisting on slowing down the kids' dialogues as well as the first two did.
The color, the creativity, the story, the acting, the people.
UNFORGETTABLE.  Everyone ought to get past the ""witch and wizard"" thing  and thinks about platform nine and three-auarters!

What a marvel.  And we woulda missed it if we had been stuffy old people.  Shame, it would have been.

Having read all the HP books and watched all the HP movies, I must say that I am impressed.  Yes, the movies leave a lot of stuff out of them - but think about it - how long would the movies have been had they followed the book exactly?

Given that, the movies, even though a series, can stand on their own individually.  Of course, it does help if you watch them as intended.

The Half-Blood Prince gives the history of Tom Riddle/Lord Voldemort--and the explanations were more interesting and extensive in the book rather than in the movie.  However, the movie gives you enough information so that you will understand the later plots in the following sequels.

However, there is one thing I do like better in the movie than in the book--there are more scenes with Bellatrix Lestrange! For someone who was the Dark Lord's most faithful servant, who went to Azkaban for 14 years because she refused to renounce him, I felt J.K. failed to give her enough scenes and character development.  The movie gave this character more screen time, and Helena Bonham Carter is always the person you should go to to play a lunatic.  She is so good at it, I really question her mental stability in real life.

This movie allows you to see the good side to some characters you thought were bad, and it begins to make you uncertain about characters you thought were good.  It also prepares you for the many deaths of well-loved characters that are to come.",1372809600,2,1129,4.729591836734694

Also, maybe it's just my DVD player, but many of the scenes seemed over-dark visually, not enough light or contrast to even tell what was going on.

For being so long, it seemed there were a fair number of parts that moved pretty slowly.

If someone had not previously had a lot of exposure to the Harry Potter stories, it would be quite confusing.

3275177,5,B000ZECQ08,I bought this movie because I love all of the Harry Potter movies. Me and my brothers and my mom all love harry potter. All of the movies in the series are fantastic. I think everyone should give them a shot.,1372636800,,208,4.097560975609756
3275178,5,B000ZECQ08,"Good price, speedy delivery.  Trying to complete the series so I can watch them in order and perhaps understand them as well as my grandson does.",1372550400,,145,4.576923076923077
3275179,5,B000ZECQ08,"As I have stated before in some of my earlier reviews, its obvious that you cannot take a book that has more pages and words than bees have hives and make a movie. You can however, take a book and make a movie that stays true to form and does its best to keep up with the pace of the original novel. In that category we have: Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince.

The acting in this movie was great. I feel that Alan Rickman, Michael Gambon, and even Tom Felton  (though he is a bit of a cry baby at times in this one) shine in this movie especially.

Harry Potter is growing up rapidly as he is now 16 and set to start another year at Hogwarts. Dumbledore meets Harry outside of the wizarding world and then asks a favor of Harry. From there, we meet a new professor, Horace Slughorn. Not long after these series of events while Harry is on his way to Hogwarts with Ron and Hermione, suspicions arise after seeing Draco and Narcissa talking to what appears to be Death Eaters. And that is only the beginning of the mystery.

Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince deals with issues such as: love, loyalty, and sacrifice. The tone of the movie overall can be described as engagingly humorous, eagerly romantic, but as serious as the book is; some even argue that this is one of the darker stories in the series, I can be inclined to agree tremendously. It is an enjoyable 153 minute movie.

Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince's final score:

5 stars",1372291200,4,1456,4.315018315018315

I've seen all the movies at least once, if not more than that, over the years. I'm now getting my husband to watch the series. He's actually really enjoyed it so far, but he fell asleep during this one. It is just much slower than the others. The action doesn't really start until the last 45 mins of the movie.

3275197,4,B000ZECQ08,Kept my interest throughout the film. Enjoyed the character development and teenage interest in the opposite sex! Remembered that awkward age.,1370390400,,142,5.809523809523809

3275199,5,B000ZECQ08,Totally AWESOME. One of the best franchise movies of all time. Spooky/scarry at times but the action does not stop! Probably not for small children because of the content. I hope they bring it back like the HOBBIT has done and is still going on!,1370304000,,245,4.466666666666667
3275200,5,B000ZECQ08,I already wrote about all of the Harry Potter shows.  They were all very good but a couple of them were too dark to see on the TV.  I also have all of the books as well.,1369785600,,169,3.5405405405405403
3275201,1,B000ZECQ08,"It misses the book by a mile. Which would be fine if the movie itself was any good. Acting, writing, and directing were all terrible.",1369785600,,133,4.36
3275202,5,B000ZECQ08,The Harry Potter books are so detailed that it was hard for me to imagine that the movies would be able to live up to them. But they have and Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was no exception. The actors do an excellent job portraying their characters and keep the viewer on the edge of their seat throughout the film.,1369699200,,324,4.327868852459017
3275203,4,B000ZECQ08,This is the first of the 8 films that I truly loved. They did a great job with all of the last three.,1369699200,,101,3.4347826086956523
3275204,5,B000ZECQ08,"""Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Voldemort is tightening his grip on both the Muggle and wizarding worlds and Hogwarts is no longer the safe haven it once was. Harry suspects that dangers may even lie within the castle, but Dumbledore is more intent upon preparing him for the final battle that he knows is fast approaching. Together they work to find the key to unlock Voldemort's defenses and, to this end, Dumbledore recruits his old friend and colleague, the well-connected and unsuspecting bon vivant Professor Horace Slughorn, whom he believes holds crucial information. Meanwhile, the students are under attack from a very different adversary as teenage hormones rage across the ramparts. Harry finds himself more and more drawn to Ginny, but so is Dean Thomas. And Lavender Brown has decided that Ron is the one for her, only she hadn't counted on Romilda Vane's chocolates! And then there's Hermione, simmering with jealousy but determined not to show her feelings. As romance blossoms, one student remains aloof. He is determined to make his mark, albeit a dark one. Love is in the air, but tragedy lies ahead and Hogwarts may never be the same again.

The cast led by Daniel Radcliffe (as Harry), Rupert Grint (as Ron) & Emma Watson (as Hermione) is excellent! The directing by David Yates (who also directed ""Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix"" (2007), he is also directed the upcoming ""Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Parts I & II"" (2010 & 2011) is excellent! The screenplay (based On J.K. Rowling's novel) by Steve Kloves (who also did the screenplays to ""Wonder Boys"" (2000) & almost all of the Harry Potter movies, with the exception of ""The Order Of The Phoenix"") is excellent!

The music by Nicholas Hooper (who also did the music to ""Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix"") is excellent! The cinematography by Bruno Delbonnel (who also did the cinematography to ""Across The Universe"" (2007) is excellent! The film editing by Mark Day (who also did the film editing to ""Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix"" & ""Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Parts I & II"") is excellent! The casting by Fiona Weir (who also did the casting to ""Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire"" (2005), ""Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix"" & ""Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Parts I & II"") is excellent! The production design by Stuart Craig (who also did the production design to all of the Harry Potter movies) is excellent! The art direction by Andrew Ackland-Snow (senior art director) (who also did the art direction to almost all of the Harry Potter movies, with the exception of the upcoming ""The Deathly Hallows Part II""), Alastair Bullock (who has worked on almost all of the Harry Potter movies, with the exception of ""The Sorcerer's Stone"" (2001), Molly Hughes (who has worked on almost all of the Harry Potter movies, with the exception of ""The Sorcerer's Stone"" & ""The Chamber Of Secrets"" (2002), Tino Schaedler (who also did the art direction to the upcoming ""Prince Of Persia: The Sands Of Time"" (2010) and also worked on ""Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix""), Hattie Storey (who has worked on ""Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire"", ""Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix"" & the upcoming ""Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part I""), Gary Tomkins (who has worked on all of the Harry Potter movies) & Sloane U'Ren is excellent! The set decoration by Stephanie McMillan (who also did the set decoration to all of the Harry Potter movies) is excellent! The costume design by Jany Temime (who also did the costume design to almost all of the Harry Potter movies, with the exception of ""The Chamber Of Secrets"" & ""The Sorcerer's Stone"") is excellent!

This is an excellent sequel to the Harry Potter movies. This is an excellent film that is one of the best movies of the year. It is also one of the best movies of the summer.",1369526400,,3925,4.743777452415813

I love all the movies in the series but this one is my favorite I think because Harry and friends are gettting into their teenage years and it is a bit more mature than they were in the beginning and also there's the epic event of Dumbledore's final movie which he is still living in the film and I think that's a crucial piece/part of the entire series. peace love hp!,1368403200,,412,4.282051282051282

3275222,5,B000ZECQ08,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is the best movie of the entire series.  Every scene, shot and frame is a Gesamtkunstwerk-a complete work of art blending color, myth, story, music, and mood that flows into the viewer's mind.  It is hypnotic.

The movie advances the series story in that Ron and Hermione reveal their feelings for each other and Harry likewise shows his feelings for Ginny.  Additionally, Voldemort appears to triumph over Dumbledore.  As a result the entire movie, from one end to another invokes a dark spirituality that taps into the deepest myths of Western Civilization.  One scene combines the myth of Merlin and Beowulf in a magical showdown in a cave.

Superb acting by all parties-especially Jim Broadbent who plays a delightful Professor Slughorn as well as Tom Fleton's outstanding portrayal of the torn Draco Malfoy

The best movie of the entire series-rich, complex, intense, and satisfying.",1367107200,,927,5.133333333333334
3275223,2,B000ZECQ08,They can't fit the whole book into a movie or even a mini series but they should at least follow the story.  There are scenes that are obviously not in the book that who knows what they are about. If you enjoyed the book save your money. The movie is a huge disappointment.

3275226,3,B000ZECQ08,"I agree with many reviewers that the movie was a faint imitation of a great book.  While the books themselves get darker in theme,the dark and oppressive atmosphere of the movie  and the lackluster recreation of some of the events in the book made for a mediocre and one dimensional viewing experience.",1366243200,,302,4.788461538461538
3275227,3,B000ZECQ08,"I LOVE Harry Potter like the rest of us book nerds out there but this is by far the worst film of the script-to-screen adaptations in this franchise (Order of the Phoenix being the best in my opinion, not counting the ""resolution"" films).

3275229,3,B000ZECQ08,"I had originally watched this movie about a year after it originally came out. As I'm now listening to the audio book (5 stars there, especially for Jim Dale, the narrator), I thought I re-watch it as frankly I couldn't remember much about it except the end.

I now know why. The full book contains so much detail that it's hard to see how to cram it into a 2 hour movie, and it shows. I failed to feel any sense of ""flow"" through the movie. It jumps so quickly from scene to scene that it feels like a montage of vignettes, not a story. This hurts any immersion into it, which is why it ends up being forgettable if you haven't read the books.

I won't quibble with what was cut or changed as such is rather inevitable with trying to condense a large book into what has to be essentially a novella in length for a movie. In fact, it probably needed to be very aggressively trimmed down some more. Now with the hindsight of what the end of the series was, it probably could be done much better now.",1366156800,,998,4.192708333333333

I can generally look at the two separately, but the one thing I dislike about this movie is how they change the reason that Harry does not intervene in the climatic scene.  Although most people have likely seen the movie several times and know how it ends I don't want to give away too much just in case someone reading this does not know the ending.  In the book Harry is stunned and covered with his invisibility cloak.  That makes a far better explanation of why he does not help than hiding in the shadows.

Aside from that, I do like the movie.  Again a lot is cut from the book, but the film (aside from what I mentioned above) does seem to follow it fairly well.  I do like that Draco does get to do a lot more in this movie than just sneer at Harry.  Tom Felton proved himself to be a very good actor, which is not something you would have really known from all the other movies because his job has been just to be a pain in the ass.

As with all the other Ultimate Editions, there are a lot of extras.  It does not have an extended edition of the movie.  The deleted scenes are available in the special features, but they are not incorporated into the movie itself.  For some people that will be a deal killer.  Certainly if you have already purchased the theatrical editions you are not going to get anything more in the movie itself.  If you are interested in getting more extras and you are not double dipping by purchasing this, then it is worth adding to your collection.",1364428800,,1637,4.255663430420712

3275265,2,B000ZECQ08,Why someone would take out whole sections of the book that are necessary to the plot only to insert scenes that add NOTHING to the plot is beyond me. I also would like to know why they have Harry giddy after taking Felixis and making a horrible joke FOR LAUGHS about the pincers of Aragog then sitting kicking his feet back and forth in a chair with a simpering smile on his face.

It's as if just because the leads are growing up, typical muggle romantic angles prevail. Gone are the days of cheery fantasy, and now we must deal with love affairs, growing up, and death. I don't read the books, therefore I miss nothing, but the lead actors are so captivating, they could eat a bowl of rice, & still make it seem worthwhile. Hard  handedness subject matter begin to make this HP a much more dark and sinister of the series. I miss the goblins & ghoulies.",1361577600,,613,4.5636363636363635
3275276,5,B000ZECQ08,"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince is a fantastically well done and richly satisfying movie. Here,we see the darkest and most mature Harry Potter movie of the 1st 6 by far. The charm and innocence of Sorcerer's Stone that so defined Sorcerer's Stone is completely gone now. Harry is growing up and preparing himself to take on his greatest challenges yet. As those who have read the book know,Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince really has 2 important storylines to it. On one hand,Half Blood Prince is a backstory story where we learn more about Voldemort's past. At the same time,Half Blood Prince is also a setup story as the events that occur in Half Blood Prince in real time are setting up the events of Deathly Hallows. The film does a brilliant job of bringing those things to life. I was especially happy with the depiction of the day Dumbledore first met the young Tom riddle. That was a scene the filmmakers nailed. I was also very pleased with the way the circumstances of the Half Blood Prince's book were handled,both in terms of that 1st Potions lessons and in the scene where Harry is forced to get rid of it. Then the acting was superb. Daniel,Rupert,Emma,and Alan have mastered their characters by this movie. And Michael Gambon gives his best performance as Dumbledore in this movie,particularly in the many scenes in which he and Harry are alone together, Finally,I was immensely satisfied with the climax. Apart from the presentation of the events themselves,the emotional aspects of the climax hit the heart for me. Even after many viewings,I get teary eyed when Dumbledore dies and when the students are all raising their wands in tribute to him. This is a very poignant time for Hogwarts. In this movie,Dumbledore is preparing Harry for what lies ahead as events culminate in the climax that sets up the major war in Deathly Hallows. My only criticisms are that they should have included the memory where that witch shows Voldemort the Cup and Locket so they,as Horcruxes that become important in Deathly Hallows, would be properly introduced in this movie. That memory should have been in the movie instead of the Ron-Lavender and Dean-Ginny stuff,which should have been cut from the movie (and the book) because it added NOTHING to the plot.  Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince is a deeply rewarding movie that MUST get 5 stars.",1361491200,,2365,4.796568627450981

The problem is the disc they sent me.  First of all, it was not shrink wrapped. Used?  I don't buy used dvd's.  And it was shipped by Amazon, along with other free shipping items, so it should have been new. When I opened it, there was a large blue blob on the face of the disc.  I tried to remove said blue blob gently, but it did not come off.  Since the disc played okay, I guess IO can't complain about the blue crud.

This disc was priced the same as the TWO Deathly Hallows discs combined.  You'd think it would therefore be twice as good, in condition and in content. Not so.",1360108800,,641,4.112903225806452

3275325,5,B000ZECQ08,"Director David Yates takes us through Harry Potter's (Daniel Radcliffe) pivotal sixth year at Hogwarts, where we see him growing still closer to his final confrontation with the Dark Wizard (Ralph Fiennes), who would quite faciley harm a guy in glasses.
  Still reeling from the aftermath of the Battle of the Ministry of Magic, Hary hasn't spent much time at his relatives' residence in Little Whinging, but has spent much of the summer riding trains to keep his mind off of things.
  At one point, as he is reading his wizarding world newspaper in a Muggle diner in Little Whinging, he enters into a flirtation with a pretty waitress(Elarica Gallander) who takes an interest in the contents of his newspaper. But a promising date with the young lady is aborted by the unexpected arrival of Dumbledore(Michael Gambon), who escorts Harry to the residence of Professor Horace Slughorn(Jim Broadbent) who is hiding from Voldemort and the Death Eaters. This professor, like many, knew Harry's parents, and Dumbledore wishes to have him reinstated at Hogwarts, as his presence there is essential to the defeat of Voldemort. Slughorn, who remembers Harry mother, Lily(Geraldine Sommerville), his former student, with a particular fondness, agrees to do so.
 Spending time with the Weasleys at their home, The Burrow before returning to school, Harry and his best friends, Ron(Rupert Grint)and Hermione(Emma Watson), enjoy each other's company, having a laugh over a wisecrack about Dumbledore's supposed age as they gather round an indoor fire burning from a magically suspended wad of newspaper, in what will be an ironic moment.
 As they leave the new joke shop run by Ron's brothers, twins Fred and George(James and Oliver Phelps), the three friends notice Draco Malfoy(Tom Felton)and his mother, Narcissa( Helen McCrory) going into Borgin and Burkes wandshop in the seedy Knockturn Alley, where they associate with Death Eaters. Voldemort has chosen Draco for a secret mission as the Dark Lord's grip on the wizarding and Muggle worlds tightens. Making an Unbreakable Vow with Narcissa a Bellatrix Lestrande's (Helena Bonham Carter) behest, Severus Snape( Alan Rickman) promises to shield Draco and accept the assignment if Draco fails to carry it out.
  Amid torment from Draco on the Hogwarts Express, Luna Lovegood(Evanna Lynch)rescues Harry.
  Once back on campus, Professor McGonnagal(Maggie Smith) urges Harry and Ron to take Slughorn's Potions class at the last moment, resulting in their having to borrow textbooks for the course, since they don't have their own. The phrase ""Half- Blood Prince"" is on the flypage of Harry's textbook, which features additional information ennabling him to excel in the class, even besting the brilliant Hermione.
 In the meantime, Ron, the new Keeper of the Gryffindor Quidditch team wins a game because Harry psychs him into believing he has been given the potion, Liquid Luck.
 The new sports hero celebrates his new status as well as his budding romance with the ditzy Lavender Brown(Jessie Cave). Hermione is reviled and hurt by this,  turning to Harry for consolation as he admits his own feelings for Ron's sister, Ginny (Bonnie Wright), who is currently dating his roomate, Dean Thomas(Alfie Enoch).
  Among the mysteries Harry and company will deal with besides that of the riddle of the Half-Blood Prince will be the mystery of what Slughorn knows about Voldemort's rise to power,and the curious possesion of student Katie Bell (Georgian Leonidas) after she is exposed to a beautiful necklance in a jewel case outside of Hogsmeade, and the question McGonagall broaches to him, Ron, and Hermione:""Why is it that when something happens, it is always you three?""
  This film will also reveal the loss of one of gamekeeper Hagrid's (Robbie Coltrane) cherished companions,and Harry's use of that opportunity to get Slughorn to reveal the truth about Voldemort's rise to power, as well as Harry's growing relationship with the Weasleys and Professor Lupin's(David Thewlis) and Tonks(Natalia Tena)amid the destruction of the Weasley's home by Bellatrix Lestrange and Fenrir Greyback(Dave Legano).
  Soon, the young James Bond of the Wizarding World will lose his staunchest champion amid a touching tribute led by McGonagall, in which the light of the wands of Hogwarts will drive the Dark Mark from the sky,hopefully symbolic of a favorable outcome for the forces of good in the not-too-distant future.",1356307200,,4446,5.254237288135593

3275379,4,B000ZECQ08,"Ah the Half Blood Prince, we're nearing the end.  This is after all the sixth book/movie in the series.  And if you haven't seen any of the others go do that first, you shouldn't be starting here.  It just doesn't make sense.  Moving on, I was a little more relieved to see that this movie followed the story better than the previous ones, but not nearly as good as the first few movies in the series.

Voldemort is back and the entire wizarding community now knows it.  Still reeling from the loss of Sirius, Harry approaches school with a restlessness that can't seem to settle.  He also realizes he has rising feelings for a classmate and a rising hatred for Draco Malfoy who he suspects is up to no good.  Under the tutelage of Dumbledore he begins to learn about Lord Voldemort and start unraveling the mysteries of how to beat him.  But he's more dangerous than ever, especially with all of his followers free and eager to get at Harry.  Even Hogwarts is weakening in its protection of the students.  And it's hard to concentrate on school let alone learn in that type of environment.

Characters:
Daniel Radcliffe:  Harry Potter
Rupert Grint: Ron Weasley
Emma Watson: Hermione Granger
Helena Bonham Carter: Bellatrix Lestrange
Jim Broadbent: Horace Slughorn
Robbie Coltrane: Rubeus Hagrid
Warwick Davis: Filius Flitwick
Tom Felton: Draco Malfoy
Michael Gambon: Albus Dumbledore
Alan Rickman: Severus Snape
Maggie Smith: Minerva McGonagall
David Thewlis: Remus Lupin

Radcliffe did another fantastic job in this movie.  He really shows the maturity that Harry gets after the events of the previous year and what he's seen.  It was really neat to see him grow that way.  Grint and Watson were also good, just not as good as Radliffe, although they all still work marvelously together.  Carter as Bellatrix is always a hoot to watch, she's got the mad nutter routine down well and you can't help but giggle even if she is a bad guy.  Gambon really stepped it up as Dumbledore as well, he finally had that compassion that I'd come to expect from the books and he really looks after Harry in this one.  That and he is very very brave in the role he has to play.  The rest of the characters were ok, I enjoyed Luna Lovegood again and Ron's girlfriend is a sight to behold as goofy as she is.  But they didn't really take center stage and Radcliffe had the most screentime, as is proper.

This one followed the book a little better, but it was still missing several scenes that really made the story.  But it did include some really good ones, especially the scenes with Dumbledore and Harry.  I appreciated that they took quite a bit of movie time to include those.  But still, there was a little bit of rushing in this story and I kind of wish with some of these books that they would have split them in two like they did with the last book.  I think it would have really made the series better, especially for fans of the books.  Regardless, the movie was still enjoyable and I can definitely see those who haven't read the book enjoying it completely.

The special effects were ok in this one.  The details were missing again, and it seemed that the good special effects were only brought out for the big stuff (with the exception of the beginning in Fred & George's store, that was excellent).  I wish that they would go back to working on the details, it's what made the first two movies so wonderful.  The music was a little less in this one too, and even the starting song was changed slightly.  Not enough to really disappoint me, but enough that I noticed.  Overall, I guess I just have to say I wish they put as much care into this movie as they did the first.

Still a valuable part of the series, and you can't watch the rest without watching this one.  It belongs on the shelf with all the rest.

3275380,4,B000ZECQ08,this is the best of them all. i do love every single book and movie about Harry Potter. I normally read books for an older audience but this still captured my heart. Read it and see it!,1348531200,,185,4.027027027027027
3275381,4,B000ZECQ08,"I'll start this off by saying that I loved the first two Harry Potter movies.  Then they made the unfortunate mistake in their replacements of director, composer, and Dumbledore over the next couple installments and I grew increasingly frustrated with the series.  They cut out important parts of the book to focus on things that didn't even happen!  How could they cut out the Quidditch World Cup in the fourth movie?!

Anyway, the film series has gotten a bit better since then, but it's weird when I'm kinda happy that Dumbledore died in this movie... I really disliked Gambon in the role.

3275387,1,B000ZECQ08,"I found Half-Blood to be very depressing and even worse, so predictable! There is no greater sin in writing a story than being boring! Half-Blood also made no sense. No, I did not read the books, nor would I ever waste my time. The only strength in the world of Harry Potter is the bond amongst friends. This strong sense of friendship and loyalty is the only redeeming element in Harry Potter series!

I guess that's the reason why I, and many other people, keep going to the theater. Of the six films I watched so far only the previous one, film #5, ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"" felt enjoyable and made plenty of sense. In Half-Blood, I'm amazed that you can kill off a major character and have even Harry Potter, himself, going around saying: ""It was a waste, it had no meaning. He died for nothing."" How ironic when a story's main character literally sums up the ENTIRE story!

I had high hopes for Half-Blood! I don't like seeing Harry Potter and all the other ""Good Guys"" being so powerless/clueless, or a main character turning into pure evil for absolutely no reason, whatsoever! (I should be able to know what's going on by not having to read the books. I have watched every film in order, but it still made no sense!)

What is obvious to me is that the Harry Potter series has become a commodity like toothpaste and underarm deodorant! Lets stretch a very thin storyline into as many billions of dollars as possible, and see all the star-struck idiots spend their hard earned money! Sorry to say, Harry Potter could have easily been condensed into a trilogy and if Half-Blood was never written/filmed it would not have harmed the Harry Potter storyline ONE iota!

Sorry, but I refuse to watch the last two (wasn't the grand finale divided into two parts? What a surprise!) Harry Potter films. I have spent enough money on Harry Potter movie tickets and I have no intention, whatsoever, to waste another penny on making the writers and filmmakers of Harry Potter, richer!

3275397,3,B000ZECQ08,"J.K. Rowling's tale is, as always, rife with fresh ideas, and her believable characters continue to endure further challenges in the process of growing-up.  Apart from the story's more fanciful elements, there are also some real-life lessons being learned here (in boy-girl relationships and academic cheating among them).

That said, Rowling's extensive narrative doesn't fit so comfortably into a two-and-a-half hour running time.  Screenwriter Steve Kloves manages to get most of it all to work within the prescribed length (though it is hard to see the point of invented scenes like Harry's flirtation with a muggle girl in the London tube station when that screen-time could have been alloted to more of Rowling's own ideas).

Director David Yates handles the material adroitly, but his style feels more perfunctory than the series' previous directors.  One scene in particular (which I won't spoil), is a major -- and devastating -- turning point in Rowling's tale, but it lacks any dramatic intensity and proves something of a lead balloon.  The film is technically well-photographed (by Bruno Delbonnel) but is awash in low-key, shadowy lighting, and a generally drab, washed-out colour scheme.  While effective in the spookier moments, this look doesn't suit the scenes of intimacy or humor, and tends to cast a dreary pall about the film.  Nicholas Hooper provides a serviceable score, but it too is lacklustre compared to the symphonic grandeur of John Williams' Harry Potter music.

However the performers are (as usual) first rate. The established cast bring ever-more freshness to their parts, while newcomer Hero Fiennes-Tiffin (nephew of Ralph Fiennes) makes for an unnervingly sinister Tom Riddle, and veteran actor Jim Broadbent makes a fine Professor Slughorn.

Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a wonderful story which results in a very good film.  Warner Bros. Blu-ray disc boasts an excellent transfer with crisp detail.  But it does lack the epic sweep of the earlier films and doesn't deliver a satisfying emotional payoff, and so proves one of the less-enjoyable Potter adaptations.",1338595200,,2115,5.318318318318318
3275398,4,B000ZECQ08,"This is a great movie that follows the saga of Harry Potter, teenage wizard. This is one of my favorite movies. It is adventure-packed and includes jut the right amount of drama. If you want to compare the movie to the book, it does alright. The movie does a good job at covering the ""important parts"" of the book in the allotted time. Overall this is a great movie.",1337126400,,366,4.318840579710145
3275399,5,B000ZECQ08,"Once I get over all the things left out between the book and the movie (always a wrench), I can enjoy this movie a great deal. It's darker, although perhaps not darker than the Order of the Phoenix. It's also more involved with the personal lives of our main characters. Oddly, though, the kids have grown up so much that I can't be sure which ones are or are not being played by different actors. Not the main characters, certainly: but is Lavender Brown the same? Neville and Luna may or may not be: they are seen so briefly.

Anyway, the basic story is that the Death Eaters are causing a lot of trouble, even in the muggle world, and Dumbledore seems to have a plan to fight back, although the nature of the fight takes some time to develop. Even for him.

He has asked Horace Slughorn to come out of retirement and be the Potions master, while Severus Snape finally gets the position he has wanted all along: Defense Against the Dark Arts. Why? It turns out Tom Riddle was a favorite of Slughorn's when he was at Hogwarts, and Dumbledore is convinced he has vital information about Riddle. You see, Slughorn is a sort of name-dropping groupie of famous witches and wizards and their children. As Dumbledore puts it, he likes to ""collect"" names for his Slug Club. Of course he wants to collect Harry, and Dumbledore asks Harry to get close to him in the hopes of getting the necessary information. Dumbledore has a bottled memory of Slughorn talking to Tom Riddle, but it has been altered. (You know about the bottled memories; they are put into the pensieve in order to be experienced.) It is Harry's mission to get the truth from Slughorn.

Harry succeeds. It turns out Slughorn told Riddle about horcruxes, very dark magic that allows a magician to divide part of his soul and hide it in an object. So if he is killed, it's just that body that dies; he can still recover the hidden part of his soul from the horcrux. Making just one is bad enough, but apparently Voldemort made seven of them. Potter destroyed one, Riddle's diary, in the Chamber of Secrets. Dumbledore found and destroyed a ring which had been in the family of Riddle's mother for some time, and it blackened his hand in the process.

Now he believes he knows where another is hidden: in a cave by the ocean where he takes Harry with him, first extracting a promise from Harry that he will do as Dumbledore asks, no matter what. Harry promises, but it turns out to be pretty horrible to live up to. And even more horrible is what they confront when they return to Hogwarts.

I've told you too much already, especially if you haven't read the books. But believe me, there's a great deal more. For example, just what is Draco Malfoy up to?",1336867200,,2711,4.479757085020243

3275402,4,B000ZECQ08,"As an avid Harry Potter fan (of both the movies and the books) ""The Half-Blood Prince"" is decidedly darker than its predecessors (let's face it---a lot of dark things are going on with Voldemort having the wizarding community in a stranglehold and Harry and Dumbledore trying desperately to find out what makes the Dark Lord tick) but it is an amazing piece of cinematography.  I tire of individuals claiming a movie is not as well as a book-in this case, the movie would be roughly 10 hours long (although I would probably be one who would happily sit through a 10-hour Harry Potter flick).  My only dislikes are simply a matter of what I envisioned when I read the book-the young Voldemort seen in the pensieve did not meet my mental pic (I had him looking like John F Kennedy Jr. or at least John Mayer) and I felt Snape should have been more involved in the movie instead of merely being on the outskirts until the very end.  I love Alan Rickman's Snape and can't get enough of him.  Other than that, the movie is suitably photographed in dark and ominous tones and the acting is wonderful (I love Ron's girlfriend Lavendar Brown).",1334707200,2,1135,4.549019607843137

Just to taunt you, all of the previews on the disc will run in high definition, showing you what you won't see when the movie starts.

Because, you see, the movie might be stolen if they let you watch it through component, so a message pops up, explaining that video resolution is reduced when viewing through unprotected connections, and the rest of the viewing experience is no better than DVD. Possibly worse than DVD.

3275414,5,B000ZECQ08,"First off, this is a review of the movie, NOT the contents of this edition, partly because Amazon attaches the same review to all versions of the same movie that it offers (so this review will also show on the Instant option, etc. - not just the DVD), and partly because other reviewers have already stated the contents of this DVD set in any case.

Like the prior HP movies, this one does have to cut quite a bit from the book, but I think they did an EXCELLENT job of selecting the plot items that most directly relate to the overall direction of the series. And in the series, Book 6 is when it all becomes clear just what a stunning series this is, IMHO. Things turn distinctly dark in book/movie 5, with an internal battle going on between those that believe Voldemort has returned and those that don't, but now in book/movie 6 it is all out war, and this movie reflects the dark, conflicted feelings this triggers in everyone. Coupled with the increasing complexities of adolescent life - romances and break-ups etc. - this movie is much more grown-up.

I think the main things that need to be conveyed in this film are - Harry's conflicted feelings about being the 'chosen one', Dumbledore's ongoing quest to get to the bottom of what Voldemort is trying to do, and his acceptance that he must include Harry in this, the complexity of Snape's role, and the shifting of feelings amongst Hermione, Ron, Jenny and Harry. These are what drive the series, and they are all conveyed brilliantly, in a movie that never fails to entertain, even with its much darker visuals and tone. So although there's a fair amount of the book left out, what is essential is there, and that is what good book adaptation are all about.",1327881600,,1719,4.541935483870968

Ginny did not accompany Harry there so that he would never find the book again. Actually in the book, Harry went there to hide the book from Snape after the Sectumsempra incident with Malfoy. That was a crucial scene in explaining how Harry finds the diadem of Ravenclaw in the 7th book.

& To those who defend that ""movie's must be adapted,"" well, J.K. Rowling's books were masterpieces that would have been brilliant left alone. They entirely skipped the battle scene and funeral - two huge chunks of the book's ending. I mean, really -- how can you DO that? The editors could have chosen to delete un-needed scenes, but to get rid of some of the most important ones and to add entirely fake scenes that didn't develop the plot in any way was just plain stupid. The movie gets most its viewers from fans of the BOOKS. It's called HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE because it is supposed to represent the BOOK.

The whole movie was extremely dark and gloomy - very gray and dull. Instead of trying to be overly artistic, they should have added more color... it was hard to tell when it was day and night. Undeniably the weakest Harry Potter film.",1324425600,2,1743,4.686274509803922

3275431,4,B000ZECQ08,"Those who know me may be inclined to say that I'm not one who's really in a position to review anything associated with Harry Potter, not the least of which being his sixth installment.

I do acknowledge that my indifference for the franchise has flourished in an age dominated by movies that I believe pay more respect to the fantasy realms.

You may understand me, then, when I say that Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is one of the best films I've reviewed all year, and speaks for itself as a testament to the non-believers like myself that such a late film in the saga has driven me into humble conversion.

Those behind the scenes have finally figured out how to bring the people to the center of attention, as opposed to the magic.  And, ironically, you feel that this is the way it was supposed to have been all along.  The magic is still there; it's in the delightfully comfortable actors and actresses, many of which have come to form elegantly and beautifully.

And elegance is certainly the name of the game, here.  Everything about this film emits a sophisticated, casual eloquence to it that is much easier to appreciate than the anxiety and disjointed flash atmosphere that seemed to coalesce in the past films when there was an intermission between significant events.  Novice David Yates was patient this time around, and it paid off in spades.

Predictably, the Harry Potter universe is getting increasingly more crowded, and it would prove difficult for anyone to keep screen time balanced.  Yates does this with as much precision as one could, all things considered, but it is saddening to see some once-prominent characters now taking solace in the distant background, clearly obstructed by the charming trio, surprisingly solid Draco Malfoy (who just shines, especially considering his very minor roles in the past few installments) and the solemn Dumbledore.

The film is exempt of a great deal of action, and explosion enthusiasts may be turned off by such.  The effects play their part, though, complementing the performances instead of suffocating them, and are as striking as ever.

Ultimately, The Half Blood Prince has made me genuinely excited for what the end of times may hold for Harry and his friends, to the point where, even now, I cant help but feel a haunting and bittersweet twang of the heart that this epic journey is finally coming to an end.  Lord knows that, whatever happens, I'll be in line to witness all of it on day one and, come number seven, you should, too.",1324166400,,2516,4.793981481481482

3275445,4,B000ZECQ08,"While I have seen this ""Potter"" film in theaters, like all of them, it left me satisfied but a bit bewildered. Now that I've seen them all again, including this one out of sequence, things are falling into place. This 6th film seems to be a transition film or as the industry calls it a place setter. We lose much of the action in order to set the stage verbally for what is to come. Only one new major character appears. That of Prof. Slughorn (Jim Broadbent) who is recruited by Dumbledore to return to Hogwarts. Slughorn was instrumental in the development of another student, Tom Riddle who we now know is Lord Voldemort (seen only as a menacing cloud). We also see the conflict within Severus Snape (Alan Rickman who continues to impress). Is he really such a bad guy?? Dumbledore lays it all out for Harry. Specifically Harry is The Chosen One and the only hope against Lord V. (yes they use his name in this film). Harry must find the 7 pieces of the Horcrux that contain Lord V's soul and destroy them. I think they get 3 in this movie but one might be a fake. Never mind, now I'm confused again. In a more frivolous segment, we continue to see our 3 heroes mature. For the first time (I think), Harry kisses Ginny but hey, there's just no chemistry there...sorry. We also see that Hermione has a jealous streak about goofy Ron having a fling with a ""fangirl"". I don't see that relationship either. Still, it's fun and gives a break from the ominous tone of the primary story. While this episode is not the best it is highly suspenseful and may be the most important from a plot perspective. It sets everything up for a great conclusion.",1318896000,,1645,4.432343234323432

I'm disappointed so many reviews declare their loathing of Yates as director. This leads me to question whether they understand what directors actually do... Anyway.

The book to me was rather slow paced and at times tedious (but still enjoyable). I felt the movie could be equally slow paced but I believe that was because of what they chose to add compared to what they got rid of:

Added:
-Cafe scene (aka: Harry is a player... not.)
-Too much Ron/humor time in the beginning (as much as I enjoyed both)
-Bellatrix and Death Eaters attacking the Burrow

Got rid of:
-Dursleys versus Dumbledore
-Snape and Harry's interactions
-Awesome Voldemort/Tom Riddle memories
-Ginny and Harry's relationship development
-Harry being a jerk about Malfoy (while he was correct, I was glad they made Harry's character less of a jerk, to put it nicely)
-Bill and Fleur (and Mrs. Weasley) (When Fleur and Mrs. Weasley make up at the end)
-The original Tom Riddle actor (from CoS) (although, understandable after so many years..)

These changes both helped the movie along and confused the heck out of everyone. I had finished the book about an hour before watching this movie, and I was still a bit unsure of the logic. I give this movie 4 stars, however, because of the quality of the cinematography, special effects, and acting.

3275461,5,B000ZECQ08,"I took a break from the Harry Potter movies after I saw the fourth, which I believe was one of the worst movies I have seen in some time. I find the book itself to be perhaps the weakest of the series (at least in its contribution to the seven-book narrative), and the film adaptation seemed more interested in simply realizing as many scenes in the book as possible rather than creating a coherent story.

After seeing the Deathly Hallows movies, however, I decided to view movies five and six to see if David Yates did as brilliant a job as he did with book seven. He did. With Order of the Phoenix and Half-Blood Prince he was not afforded the luxury of a two-part release, but these films are nevertheless excellent films.

Fans of the series complain that Yates acted as a rather poor surgeon on the book, using a meat cleaver to ineptly amputate scenes from Rowling's book. These fans miss the point. The Harry Potter movies are designed as summer blockbusters, not as realizations of the books. The movies must merely capture the essence of the book, and present the plot as coherently as possible. I believe Yates to be the only Potter director to understand this. When this concept is understood, I think disappointed fans will find that many scenes they thought they lost actually ARE in the film. I will give but one example:

There is no opening scene between the two ministers.

True, but what, really, was the point of this scene? As a Muggle, the Prime Minister offered those readers not obsessed with everything Potter to get a nice crash course in all things Wizard. In a film, we really do not have time to re-explain what has already been covered in five films. The other point of this scene was to show how Voldemort's rising power affects Muggles and Wizards alike. Do we really need Rowling's clunky dialogue between two men in an office to show this? Film is a visual medium, and the collapse of the pedestrian bridge over the Thames brilliantly depicts the terror growing in the non-Wizarding world.

If you're looking for the books, go to your bookshelf and read them. Half-Blood Prince is an excellent movie that not only captures the spirit of the book, but is also re-watchable. Highly recommended.",1313366400,,2226,4.653944020356234

3275471,3,B000ZECQ08,"When I say that I was disappointed in this product, I don't mean that I was disappointed with Amazon's delivery of the product-although they did fib about the look and contents of the package. At first glance I noticed that it was a movie that possibly printed in another country (possibly France) because the front and back covers were printed in French and English.  But luckily, the movie was in English. But the disappointing aspect of this review was the movie itself. A large part of this movie was storyline which I appreciated but as far as special effects and how it was filmed was my least favorite of the Harry Potter films. Of all the Harry Potter films this was my least liked because of the way it was filmed and because of the severe lack of incorporating the context of the book into the film.",1311897600,2,809,4.503401360544218

It's just INSANE that they changed that part :( Harry would have never just stood there, that is why Rowling made Dumbledore petrify him in the first place, it goes against everything in his nature and in the nature of the books & story as a whole.",1311465600,4,752,4.704545454545454
3275473,3,B000ZECQ08,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was directed by David Yates and released in theatres on July 15, 2009. It was released on DVD December 08, 2009. The movie stars Danielle Radcliffe (Harry Potter), Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) and Emma Watson (Hermione Granger) as the young trio of friends attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
Since the murder of Sirius Black and the escape of the Death Eaters from Azcaban Prison, no one is safe. Wizards, witches and muggles alike are being terrorized by the Death Eaters and their seemingly misguided dedication to Lord Voldemort. When professor Albus Dumbledore once again asks Harry Potter for his help, the search begins for a missing memory that is key to Voldemort's existence and also to his destruction.
While searching for the missing memory, Harry inadvertently comes across a 'potions book' once owned by The Half-Blood Prince, but who is he? A series of vicious attacks aimed at the now aging Dumbledore prompt Harry, Hermione and Ron to search out the Half-Blood Prince and try, yet again to uncover the one thing that will rid the wizardry world of Voldemort forever. But they will suffer great loss along the way and no one will be the same after they find what they seek.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is, of course, visually stunning and yet I found myself wanting more as the credits rolled. This is not the Harry PotterI have grown to expect and the supporting character's rolls were dull and lackluster. The lead characters did do their very best to save the film and it is for that reason, and that reason alone that I long to see the two final movies.
I must say that I was slightly disappointed by this film, however my children enjoyed it immensely. I am quite sure that lovers of the Harry Potter series will want to see The Half Blood Prince, as they should, in order to continue on with the series' storyline. I can only hope that the next Harry Potter movie doesn't leave me asking 'What Happened?' and that the story I have grown to love returns to the big screen. I am sadly giving Harry Potter and the Half -Blood Prince a 3-star rating and am doing so in hopes of better things to come. Please Harry, don't let me down!

I didn't hate it either, but there were many changes from the book (emissions & additions) that really upset me and many other fans.
One thing I will say (to people that have read Yates's bashing comments) about the direction & production is:
1-STOP bashing on David Yates (director) people... He did not ruin the movie! He's only the director not the screenwriter (who adapts the book 2 screen version)
2-Too many unnecessary changes to the screen version that omitted the real action of the book
3-Although I'm not a fan of David Yates, he's a decent director and did a great job in the final movies (Deadly Hallows 1 & 2)
4-STOP BASHING ON DAVID YATES... If anything, hate & yell at Steven Kloves who's the one that writes the scripts. Also yell & complaint to JK Rowling for allowing the changes to the book... NOT DAVID YATES!!!

3275480,3,B000ZECQ08,"I have 2 main things to say about this film.  One is a comment on the screenplay/story, basically what the director and screenwriter chose to put on the screen.  The other is about the actual product, that is, the DVD itself.

First, when you have a great story to film, why go to the trouble to create another one?  Of course some things needed to be left out, the book is simply too big to fit into a standard-length film.  A judicious pruning was required.  Which makes it all the more incredible that the writer and director decided to add scenes they invented in their heads that are nowhere in the book, squandering valuable time that could have been used to tell more of the ""real"" story, you know the one that millions of us have read and loved.  About what was left out and what was, inexplicably, added, others have said much and I'm not going to repeat any of that here.  Absolutely baffling.  I can't figure out what the director and writer were thinking.

Meanwhile, I have a beef with what I guess you would call the cinematography, or at least the way the film was transferred to DVD.  Yes, the story is a ""dark"" one, and it's getting darker book by book, but why does the picture have to be so dark that a viewer can barely see what's going on.  Something is wrong here.  This isn't atmospheric; it's claustrophobic.  I would like to be able to SEE what I'm watching, please.

I would love to have rated this DVD 5 stars, and there is much to like, for example, the ending is certainly suitably dramatic, but these issues have forced my rating of the DVD down to the 3 star level.",1310601600,11,1596,4.36271186440678
3275481,4,B000ZECQ08,"If you're a fan of J. K. Rowling's colossal book series then this is a no brainer.  The special feature ""A Year in Life of J. Rowling"" would be worth the extra money spent.  However this edition has so much to offer that even viewers who are not fans of the book will find this version appealing for its variety. The high definition picture and sound are amazing.  The movie iself looks and sounds as good as it did in theaters.  Also most of the special features are in HD as well.  Did I say special features?  This 2 disc set contains over six hours of special features too numerous to list.  Movie lovers that are not necessarily fans of the series will be thrilled with the numerous insights into the film-makers' process.
  For true fans the set contains a fifty page book, two Harry Potter series trading cards and a lenticular card(what used to be called holograms) front cover.  This is one of the most thorough special editions I've seen.  Everything included was of a fine quality and the film comes with the addition of a digital copy, this seems to be the status quo lately thanks to the ipod phenomenon, that can be downloaded to your computer and taken in on the go.

With all the major events in this movie, it makes the 2.5 hour-length pass by quickly.  The special effects are spot on of course, and the soundtrack is quite good with some new music and some from the previous movies.  Following the trend of the previous 2 movies, this one ends in a tragic death, and is probably the most serious of all the movies.

3275503,5,B000ZECQ08,"What people need to understand is that it ISN'T UP TO WARNER BROS or the Company that releases films on DVD/BD to include a director's cut!! They can't just make up an extended version by cobbling togetehr deleted scenes and include it on the disc. The original DIRECTOR of the films has to be commissioned by the Production studio to come back and essentially re-edit the film and create a new transfer, essentially creating a new version.

Most director's don't have time for this process. Chris Columbus was able to because, as of late, he doesn't seem as busy and the subsequent directors. David Yates has been busy creating the momumentally epic conclusion to this series and unfortunately, that didn't allow him the time to come up with director's extended cuts in time for the studio's release dates for 5 and 6.

As for 3 and 4, there NEVER WAS any director's extended cuts, as the director's of those films stated that what was released in theatres was their intended vision. David Yates may have meant to include more, but ultimately he never was able to make time as he has a wonderful final installment to get made.

Read the books, watch the deleted scenes and shut up! These are still ULTIMATE COLLECTOR'S EDITIONS because each contains the ONLY VERSION of 3,4,5 and 6 that exist. If you want extended cuts, become a director, do a remake and then see how easy it is to fight the studio in charge of theatrical distribution. THEY control the money and the decisions.

First two came out, had a few minutes each of extra footage and we were excited for the rest to come out. I wasn't too surprised there was only a little extra in 1 & 2 since the books were tiny as well. I was very disappointed when the release of 3 & 4 had no extra footage. As the books got bigger, more and more of the story was left out. Many of us, undoubtedly were excited about seeing more of the books brought to life. Take ""Goblet of Fire"" for example. We all read the play-by-play of the Quidditch Cup and I, for one, would have loved to have seen more of the game in action. Or how about Quidditch being cancelled in OOTP, maybe when they learn to apparate, etc... Too many things we were anticipating in the extended versions are disheartening to know we'll never see.

I had planned on purchasing the Ultimate Editions for movies 3-8 as they became available but I see no reason to spend the extra money on a little bit more bonus content.  Yes, they will still get my money, but not as much (and I'm sure I'm not the only one that feels this way).

I think it's rather gorgeous myself. The film forsakes some of the finer points of the book in order to keep a more palpable rhythm and mood that make this by far the most emotionally intense of the Potter experiences. The film stands on its own as a great piece, regardless of how close it is to the book. Everything that was abridged was done so with class and reason that only helps to streamline the Potter story into one of greater emotional depth and slightly faster plot development for its transfer into the film medium. Highly Recommended.

3275514,1,B000ZECQ08,"Wow, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, the blu-ray experience, totally sucked.  After fast-forwarding through the Wizard of Oz advertainment (nothing against TWOO, mind you) four times, no combination of 'maximum Experience' options would actually play the movie w/o Rupert Grint popping in
, picture-in-picture, followed shortly by special effects options and a special section from the director about the Millenium Bridge.  This is fine on a rainy Saturday afternoon when I've seen it 6 times already, but I really miss just inserting the disc and watching the movie.

AARGH!

This is only the 2-disc edition; perhaps if I'd sprung for the 3-disc edition there'd be one disc that just worked.

3275516,3,B000ZECQ08,"I love the Potter movies but this one just seemed like a badly abridged version of the book. Maybe it is because Half Blood Prince is the first Potter book I read and the book is bound to be better than the movies, but I don't think that is the case here. Voldemort's childhood and how Dumbledore uses the pensive to travel back in time to see his parents and then meet the young boy at the orphanage himself was just amazingly fleshed out and detailed, capitvating and descriptive in the book. Reading through how Voldemort came to be was fascinating and it allowed the audience to grasp the troubled past he endured, the darkness he exhumed and the demons that haunted him so early on eventually rendering him the person he became. There is suddenly an entire human side to Voldemort never seen before and that was powerful. But the movie missed through all these details and just rushed through it. The lake scene was pretty cool - but again in the book it was just so much more eerie than in the movie. I don't think anyone who hasn't read the book will truly understand the artistic mastery that went into creating this work of art; and it really is a work of art: Rowlings outdid herself on this one. I was captivated until the last word and i don't like fiction books.

They should have made this movie into two parts, just like with The Deathly Hollows. I must I admit I still liked it because I love Harry Potter and the visualization of the world of Harry Potter, but I think they could have done a much better job on this one especially because now, after reading all the Potter books, I believe The Half Blood Prince is THE best book in the series.

The ongoing character development of our familiar friends has come through loud and clear; especially the interactions among Harry, Hermoine, Ron and Ginny. The characterization of Professor Slughorn was spot-on and the usual high caliber acting of all the 'faculty' was quite welcome when you consider the length of this saga and the tendency for actors to become overly familiar with their respective roles. My only criticism of this movie was the fight that lead up to Dumbledore's death...the book was much more exciting and I was somewhat let down by the movie. All in all, I felt that this movie did a great job setting up the Deathly Hallows.

3275524,1,B000ZECQ08,"First of all, I will start by saying that I am usually not the type to go on review boards to slam or bash a product, but Warner Bros. officially screwed up with this as far as I'm concerened!!!

I ABSOLUTELY AGREED 100% WITH EVERYONE ELSE ABOUT THE EXTENDED CUT!

I own every single Harry Potter film on DVD, and when I finally got a Blue Ray Player a few years ago, I decided that if I would update my copies of the Harry Potter films to Blu Ray, that I might as well wait and get the ""Ultimate"" Editions because they would contain the Extended Cuts...  And so I purchased ""Sorcerer's Stone"" and ""Chamber of Secrets"" Ultimate Editions instead of the regular Blu Ray editions (Which are much cheaper) mostly because of the Extended Cuts.  This was the biggest selling point and the main reason to get the Ultimate Editions.

Then they release ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" and ""Goblet of Fire"" in Ultimate Editions but with no Extended Cuts.  They messed up on that because by doing that they are automatically taking away the one incentive that makes it an ""Ultimate"" Edition.  Now you're just ripping people off by giving out the same product in a fancier and more expensive packaging.

When ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" and ""Goblet of Fire"" Ultimate Editions came out last year without the Extended Cuts, Warner Bros. made the excuse that this was supposedly because the original Directors of the films didn't want to go back and re-edit a Director's Cut, and so they decided to respect their wishes.

That said, I was hoping that David Yates, the Director of ""Order of the Phoenix"" and ""Half-Blood Prince"" would be able to do the Extended Cuts since he is technically still working on the films.  So the whole Director excuse to me is complete BS.

Way to go Warner Bros.!!!

The other thing is, what happened to the battle, the producers said that they cut it out to prevent repetiveness.

There's a lot of talk about how fans should be excited about these new releases. But there are two words missing from the descriptions of both these products: Extended Cut.

What sold me and so many other fans was the extended cuts. And so I began collecting the Ultimate Editions. And what excited me even more was the idea of more extended cuts to come, especially for The Order of the Phoenix.

Then Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblit of fire Ultimate Editions came out, and of course, there were no extended cuts. And Warner Bros. spun us a tale of directors and their creative preferences. And so, we all said ""fair enough"" (although I, for one, never quite bought that explanation). Still, I had hopes for Order of the phonex and Half blood prince. Director David Yates is on record talking about having to cut 45 minutes from The Order of the Phoenix. And yet, here we are again with no extended cut to speak of. I'm sure the studio will spin us a tale of how busy Yates has been with the final installment of the franchise, thus making it impossible to return to these previous films and give the fans what they want,AN EXTENDED CUT.

I understand Warner Bros. desire to get these editions on the shelves before the final film hits theaters. As for me, I would gladly wait a year for these editions if it meant getting to see extended cuts of the films. But this is not about the fans. This is about the bottom line. If the WB can get a half-@$$ product onto the shelves sooner, and therefore presumably make more money in the final season of Potter movie mania, then who cares what the fans want?

3275534,5,B000ZECQ08,"Why that title? Because OOP and GOF both left me too many questions about what was going on during the movie since I have not read the books. What I feel were important scenes (for us who have not read all the books) key to understanding the flow of the story were left out in those two movies ... especially in OOP, which left me totally confused.

This, thank goodness, is not the case in HBP. The opening scenes in the film clearly establish its tie to the previous movie (Order of the Phoenex) and all sequences within the story follow upon one another ... although I am a little confused about how Snape's potion's book came to be in the cupboard at school and why it was deemed to be so much of a problem that Harry and Ginny decided to hide it away where no one, including Harry, could ever find it again. The book probably explains this a bit, but then, I haven't read the book.

The acting, as always, is superb and enjoyable. The characterization of Horace Slughorn adds immeasurably to the story. He is complex and yet very simple and easy to understand. He is very human as well .. and has some interesting quirks about him.

I was a little surprised to find out that Snape was the half-blood prince and do not understand the importance of the title or how he manages to have it. But this does not detract from the movie at all. Matter of fact, it's not mentioned until the last minutes of the film and was never really a question to be answered during the length of the flick.

The ending of the movie is certainly a surprise (I won't ruin it here for those who may not have seen the film and haven't read anything on the Internet) and was a bit put out. However, in reading more on the up and coming two part movie, The Deathly Hallows, one finds out that the person they think is a rogue and traitor is not that at all. Anyway, it's a jaw-dropper.

Technically, the DVD is as good as any made today. The picture and colors are clear and bright, the audio is free from noise or hiss and is immently understandable, and there are extras on the DVD for those that like some background to the story itself.

All in all, a fine addition to the ongoing serial of Harry Potter. I shall be very disappointed to see the series end with the release of Deathly Hallows, Part II. But then, the adventures can't go on forever. Additionally, both the concept (by Ms Rowlings) and the films have given us a fine bit of film making and story telling that we may enjoy again and again throughout the years.

Definately recommended for all ages.

Did Warner Bros add neww things to their ultimate HP movie sets? Yes!!! What do you call the eight hour documentary spread all over all eight ultimate editions? This is what clearly sets the Ultimate Editions apart from their standard DVD, and original Blu_Ray DVD releases. In my opinion the eight hour documentary is one of the most original speical features concepts available on Blu_Ray or any DVD for that matter. As a plus you also get most of the bonus material from the standard DVD release of OOTP, along with the material on the original BLu_Ray release, plus some of the bonus material from the long dead HD DVD release. Now, might it have been nice to include a directors cuts of all of the movies? Yes. Is it worth rating the entire Ultimate edition release a low 1 just becasue out of all the special features it does not have a directors cut? Heck No!!! But we live in a society, where every fanboy throws a fit becasue a release does not have everything he/she wanted. On the other hand, we also live in a soceity where all to often movie studios double dip without porting any of the special features from the previous editions onto the new edition. Does HP OOTP UD fall into this trap? Yes and no All of the special features from the previous releases are avaiable, with the exception of the annoying games, and the one hour segment of the eight part documentary is always fun to watch. On the flip side of the coin, extended edditions would be nice, and the price for the Ultimate editions is about $10 or $15.00 to expensive
Now are the movies perfect adaptations of the books? No But overall if you appreicate the films as being a differnt medium then the books, you can understand why some things were cut out. But even though fan favorite scenes may be left out or plot ideas not as well developed, the real treat of the eight HP movies is not how well they convey the story of the books-thats already been done by J.K Rowling-but seeing Daniel, Rupert and Emma mature as actors as their chracters mature in the books is the real treat of the movies and the eight hour documentary conveys this whole aspect of the movies really well<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-Ultimate-Edition-Blu-ray/dp/B004P9FAKW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Ultimate Edition) [Blu-ray</a>].",1299801600,15,2566,4.914746543778802

All right, so I've come to the conclusion that Half Blood Prince is my least favorite of the Harry Potter movies. It's not because of all the stuff that is cut from the book, but simply because it just doesn't ""draw me in"" like the other ones do. I know the first two films aren't perfect, but they both make me so happy whenever I watch them (probably because of the nostalgia). My favorites in the series are Deathly Hallows Part I, Prisoner of Azkaban, and Order of the Phoenix.

That being said, I do like Half Blood Prince. I thought Michael Gambon gave his best Dumbledore performance here, all the young actors were good, Jim Broadbent was good (really, the acting was perfectly fine). The Cave scene is hands down the best scene in the film in my opinion. Overall, though, Half Blood Prince focused too much on the comedy/romantic aspects. I was perfectly fine with the fact that Hogwarts was more ""sexified"", but it felt as though the Tom Riddle (and the Half Blood Prince story) took a back seat to it. But still, this movie has other things to offer, and it has gorgeous cinematography.

The DVD itself is really good. None of the DVDs so far have topped the Goblet of Fire DVD, which is completely stocked with great Bonus features. This DVD has some good ones, and the best one has to be the J.K. Rowling documentary. It really gives fans a deeper insight into how J.K.'s life influenced the books.

Overall, I'd say this is worth the purchase if you're a Harry Potter fan and you want some neat bonus features on your DVD. I bought it primarily to add to my collection of all the other films.",1295827200,,1622,4.469594594594595

3275557,4,B000ZECQ08,"I haven't read this book yet (I'm halfway through The Goblet of Fire), but I saw the movie in the theater and have watched it a couple of times since. Therefore, I can only comment on the film itself and can't compare it to the book. Any comparisons to previous films in the series will be based solely on the films themselves, not the books.

An important thing to know about this film is that it was directed by David Yates, the director of the final four of the eight Harry Potter films (including the forthcoming second part of The Deathly Hallows). The Order of the Phoenix was the first one he directed, and it continued the trend of increasingly darker and more adult-oriented Potter films. That approach is carried through to this film, which is more somber, moody, and dramatic than any of the previous films. Where the first five films were fanciful and fun, containing plenty of big action set pieces, THBP has a tone of sobriety brought on by the ever-growing threat of Voldemort and his Death Eaters to not only the Dumbledore-defended Hogwarts, but the Muggle and wizarding worlds at large. Without launching into a plot synopsis, I will say that the film strikes a solid balance between teen-movie-styled romantic and school drama, the broader saving-the-world mystery epic surrounding Voldemort, and a cloak-and-dagger subplot involving the Death Eaters, Snape and Draco Malfoy, resulting in the death of a certain important character. As always, there is a special-effects laden climax to this film, but it is hardly the spectacular, extensive knock-down, drag-out wizard battle of The Order of the Phoenix. However, you do get to see Dumbledore use some kick-ass magic at the end of a heart-wrenching scene during which he faces perhaps his greatest challenge ever.

If the proverbial s*** was beginning to hit the fan during the previous (TOOTP) film, it was nothing compared to the terror and despair that this film portends for Harry, Ron and Hermoine. As a matter of fact, the excellent, harrowing The Deathly Hallows Part 1 frankly blows this film out of the water in many ways, but THBP remains the best of the first six. By this point, the filmmakers and actors had deeper, more psychologically complex material to work with, not to mention lots of practice working within the logic of J.K. Rowling's world. Therefore, just about everything in this film is a step up from the previous five, which is saying something when you're talking about a film series that consistently achieves a surprisingly high level of quality across the board. The performances this time around are particularly remarkable, especially when it comes to Alan Rickman as Snape.

This review comes with a minor warning, however. If it has not already been made clear, this film is a different beast from the first five, despite it's relatively close adherence to the overall structure of those films. Many people were disappointed by the lack of action and complained that ""not much happened"". Happily, these criticisms simply miss the point - for what it is, this is an excellent film. It's not supposed to be an action blockbuster, however it may have been marketed during the summer leading up to its release. So watch this one and then enjoy the big payoff supplied by The Deathly Hallows Part 1, and, presumably, Part 2.",1293667200,,3324,4.890070921985815

First, I like that the movies are sticking closer to the events in the books.  After the debacle that was Goblet of Fire, this and The Order of the Phoenix were refreshing breaths of fresh air.  The series does take a dark turn (as it has been since the 3rd film).  Without going into the plot and events, suffice to say this film is full of surprises and shockers (for those who haven't read the book).

At $34.99 I might have cringed a bit, but the Blu-Ray transfer is very nice.  I play on a Toshiba 49"" LCD 1080p through my PS3 and it looks great.  If you already own the DVD and want to upgrade to the HD version, then I would recommend it.  Just not for the MSRP.  Wait for a better price like I did!

Movie - 5 stars
Blu-Ray Transfer - 5 stars
Extras - 4 or 5 stars (lots of extra content)

Of note:  I did not see any of the black bands that a few other reviewers mentioned.  It may have been a bad initial batch or something intermittent.

Also, this doesn't really follow the book very well, but the director is trying to pack a lot of content into a finite film length, so sometimes sacrifices must be made.

For one, the acting has not only retained its flawless level, but has risen to new heights! Snape was picked perfectly! The horcruxes, another factor as to why this film is so high in my esteem, are immensely clever! They also explain quite a bit! The reasons behind the power of Tom Riddle's diary and the ring are explained by the horcrux theory. The film starts and ends with a bang, too. {SPOILER AHEAD!!!!!} Dumbledore's death was particularly horrifying and touching; it was quite sad. Something I was glad to see was that Harry, Ron, and Hermione are growing up. Ron and Hermione's affection for each other is by now very obvious, and I, for one, will be immensely joyful when they get married. {ANOTHER SPOILER!} Malfoy appears quite a bit, doing unknown deeds, adding to the suspense of the film. The visuals are great, as always. The film's ending will leave you in shock, but will make you extremely impatient to see the 7th Harry Potter film! When I first saw the film, I was stuck to my seat the entire 153 minutes! I was quite glad quidditch matches were introduced again; I missed them. Slughorn was very funny, as was Hagrid. The inferi were very scary, and young Tom Riddle was chilling. Harry and his friends are becoming more and more real, human, and lovable with each film, and this is no exception. I still think Luna Lovegood steals the show, and wish she could have been in the Half Blood Prince even longer than she was! The identity of the Half Blood Prince was shocking!!!!

3275575,2,B000ZECQ08,"HP & the Half-Blood Prince

This was one of my favorite books in the series and so I especially looked forward to the movie.  BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!  AAUUUGHH!

I waited for YEARS (!) and FIVE books anticipating the day when the Dursleys would receive their long-deserved comeuppance from Dumbledore for their poor treatment of Harry...  And WHAT HAPPENED?!

They actually FILMED the scene, and then decided (after I had anticipated it for YEARS ) that the audience didn't care enough about the books as written  to sit through such a LONG scene, and they cut it, only to replace it with an equally long  scene involving a presumptuous teenaged tart in a greasy-spoon diner: Harry hacks up a foreshortened verbal ejaculation, and she instantly presumes he was going to ask her out?!  Please...! What has been established about his character to make it plausible that he would entertain such an unlikely interest?

And the meeting between the Minister of Magic and the Muggle Minister...? ""(Cough, cough...) AHEM! ""Where did THAT go?!  It was ONLY one of the best, FAR ABOVE & BEYOND, most enjoyable and exquisitely disturbing and creepy...,  of all the scenes in all the books so far. So..., WHERE THE HELL DID IT GO?!

Which EXCESSIVELY INFLUENTIAL PERSON decided that this savory and delicious scene was not worth taking the time to watch?  And WHY do they still have a job?!

But I must say the most offensive change made from the book to the movie involved a violation of HP's character. In the book, HP used the potions book of the Half-Blood Prince to his advantage (no harm there), until he used a spell to harm another student in self-defense. Even though he used the spell innocently in self-defense, author Rowling treated it as an act of evil (with which I disagree).  But the movie takes a turn for the worse:  Harry is so uncertain of his right to self-defense in a threatening situation that he allows Ginny Weasley (portrayed most unattractively by Bonnie Wright) to substitute for his inner moral conscience, and then because he is such a weakly indecisive and spineless ""hero..."" She must take the spellbook from his hands and hide it while his eyes are closed!  This scene, by itself, suggests that Harry Potter is a moral ignoramus and coward.

The spellbook represents Knowledge, which in itself is neither good nor evil, but only as it is applied. So this scene implies that Harry is afraid of knowledge because he does not have the Wisdom and Strength of character to apply it ethically.  However I must admit that this flaw of character originates with the author Rowling, and is only amplified in the movie.

Also, Slughorn was miscast. (An actor  in Deathly Hallows Pt 1 seemed better for the part of Slughorn, but must have been too late).  Slughorn bursting from the armchair was painfully embarrassing!  Not convincing at all!  They should have at least digitized the effect! Barbara Eden smoking out of her bottle was MORE CONVINCING!..., and THAT was 4.5 DECADES ago!  You HAVEN'T come a long way, Baby..., er, Dude!!

It boggles my mind that with so much MONEY and so much TIME, such a POOR job was accomplished!

3275579,5,B000ZECQ08,"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince opens with several Death Eaters, flying through the air while enveloped in plumes of dark mist (like the children of Lost's smoke monster), wreaking havoc in the world of muggles.  Not only do they bust up a magic shop, but they also down a bridge in London, killing untold numbers of pedestrians.  If you had any doubts that The Half Blood Prince would continue the sinister atmosphere of the previous installments, then the first few moments of the film should put those doubts to rest with a swift knock to the head.  This time out Voldemort is at full power and his minions have free reign over their world and ours.

 Each Harry Potter film contributes one piece to the overall puzzle regarding Voldemort's past and Harry's role as his Achilles heel (or would he be the arrow that can pierce the Achilles heel).  In The Half Blood Prince the new Potions professor, Horace Slughorn, holds that next piece.  Dumbledore recruits Slughorn for the upcoming school year in hopes that he will divulge a conversation he once had with Voldemort, known at the time as Tom Riddle, before his transformation into pure evil.  Slughorn views his job as more than just a teacher in a classroom.  He also establishes a coterie of young wizards and wishes who he believes it is his duty to fashion into adults.  Harkening back to an earlier time, Slughron is the type of professor who would call the special something he recognizes in these students as ""character.""  In a bit of espionage, Harry must creep his way underneath Slughorn's wing in hopes to uncover the secret conversation.

This time around, the melodrama of high school dating is pushed to the forefront, but unlike in previous films these aren't moments the viewer must endure to get to the world of magic but rather enjoyable in their own right.  The appeal of the Harry Potter series has always been its marriage of fantastical adventure with the everyday drama of grade school.  But until The Half Blood Prince the quotidian half of that equation has always paled in comparison to the otherworldly.  One of the joys of this lengthy series of films has been the evolution of the three main actors from passable children stars to the ideal embodiment of their characters.  The Half Blood Prince also provides all three actors some great ensemble and individual moments to work with.  Much of the high school plotline stems from a love triangle between Hermione, Ron and Ron's new squeeze Lavender.  Just as Hermione has come to realize her feelings for Ron, he has found someone new.  (Although, I just can't picture those two getting old together.  I imagine Ron wearing a wife beater in front of the television while Hermione fetches him another Natty Light from the fridge).  Harry, likewise, reaches the age where he's ready to start dating, but has yet to recognize Ginny Weasley's longtime crush on him.

Perhaps the most ingenious aspect of The Half Blood Prince is how the minutia of high school life becomes a major plot point.  We all remember the used textbooks that were seemingly passed down from time immemorial and filled with scribbling, often obscene, of different penmanship.  Well, Harry discovers one such used textbook for his Potions class that contains perfections on even the textbook's recipes as well as some other magical tips.  As a reader, I absolutely love the central place books take in the world of Harry Potter, from Tom Riddle's diary to the importance of the library (Hogwarts just wouldn't be Hogwarts if they had the internet).  As a blockbuster children's author, J.K. Rowlings appears to be establishing physical books as objects of value that are just as magical as any spell or potion.

The Half Blood Prince is the film where all of the elements of a Harry Potter film--the ingenious magic spells, the battle between forces of good and evil, the childhood romance--all finally come together, like a supernatural potion, into a perfect brew.  The genius of J.K. Rowling is that, instead of writing sequels for a new wave of eight year olds every other year, she let her books mature with her audience, allowing her characters, plot and prose all grow along with the children who may have read the first book when they were even younger than Harry in his first adventure.  In The Half Blood Prince, for example, the character of Draco Malfoy, who had always been a nasty little pipsqueak, must decide whether he is more loyal to Hogwarts or to the Death Eaters.  In earlier installments it was always clear that Draco served as one of the villains, but as the stakes have risen, even the more wicked characters have trouble contending with the consequences or their actions.

Likewise, with each installment the films have displayed stunning visual complexity to match the emotional density.  And the visuals for The Half Blood Prince are perhaps some of the best of the series.  The director, David Yates, utilizes the byzantine angles of Hogwarts castle to cut and dissect the space between multiple characters, illustrating the levels of intrigue that are simultaneously occurring at the expansive Hogwarts compound.  The framing owes much to Shekhar Kapur's Elizabeth, another film that takes place within the cold confines of a castle.  The color palate of the film mimics a daguerreotype tan, giving the movie an atemoporal timelessness.  The world of Hogwarts has always been a bricolage of differing time periods, combining medieval signifiers, like wizards and castles, with memorabilia from the 1940s.  To move from the world of the muggles to the world of magic is as much a movement in time as it is a movement in space.

It is often cited as a critical truism that The Prisoner of Azkaban is the best of the series (although, this is not necessarily the case for fans of the book).  I can understand why so many critics make this assertion, and The Prisoner of Azkaban is indeed one of the top films of the series, but I truly believe that The Half Blood Prince takes the prize for the best film in the franchise.  Azkaban is a success for two reasons: 1) it was the first instance of a textual and emotional maturation of the series and 2) the film stripped away much of the grade school drama that had gummed up the works in past installments, making the first Harry Potter film that felt like a large scale blockbuster, even if its running time was slightly shorter.  The reason why The Half Blood Prince is an even better film than The Prisoner of Azkaban is because instead of hiding from some of the soap opera elements of past installments, the film chose to strengthen those aspects of the story, making the viewer just as concerned with who Harry might end up dating as they are with whether or not Harry and Dumbledore will find the correct enchanted object to stop Voldemort.  With the sixth film in the series, director David Yates has finally positioned Harry Potter as a fantasy world of cinema to be considered alongside the likes of The Wizard of Oz, The Lord of the Rings, and The Princess Bride.  You might disagree with whether or not these films deserve a place next to these esteemed films, but as the series draws to a close it is impossible to ignore their place within the genre of fantasy.",1290816000,3,7262,4.771382893685052

And although Harry and Dumbledore have managed to convince the wizarding world that Lord Voldemort has indeed returned, that fact alone is enough to make life much more perilous for our young hero.  While Dumbledore tries to discover what Voldemort's weakness may be and provides Harry with special tutoring to prepare him for the inevitable confrontation, Harry struggles to deal with the eternal teenage verities of love and the choice of career--but always with his enemy's lurking presence as his major focus.  A mysterious Potions text labelled ""property of the Half-Blood Prince"" proves pivotal to the story, and as the film approaches its conclusion, changes and revelations come thick and fast.

Like its two immediate predecessors, and probably inevitably, the sixth Harry movie loses something in translation from print, since the increasingly complex books can't be wholly transferred to film.  Indeed, disappointingly, although we do learn the identity of the Prince in the end, there are no details given as to why he called himself that, so curious viewers will definitely have to crack the book if they haven't done so already.

3275582,5,B000ZECQ08,"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince begins on a real somber note. The opening scene, only mentioned but not described in the book, shows Death Eaters causing the destruction of a massive bridge filled with people. What makes this scene unique compared to the rest of the series is that this destruction takes place in the muggle world, not the wizarding one. David Yates, directing his second Harry Potter film, takes great pains to show that there are no safe places now that Voldemort is back and his followers are out in the open. Even some places that were safe havens for Harry in the past, namely the Weasley residence and even Hogwarts itself, are besieged by Death Eaters.

However, the danger surrounding the characters at every turn doesn't keep the teen characters from being teens. Hormones run high through Hogwarts as students pair off and young love blooms. Things may be dark, but in the world of Harry Potter there will always be some light shining through. While some people complained that there was too much young love in this film, I have to admit that I found it interesting that more than ever this film really gave an impression that the teens in Harry Potter are just ordinary (well, for wizards) kids who happen to find themselves in extraordinary situations. As a result, this film is not only the darkest film of the series, it's also the funniest.

While rumors swirled that some cast members would not find their way back for the sixth Potter film (Emma Watson was considering dropping out and Tom Felton, who plays Draco Malfoy, had previously made comments that he would not make it to the end of the series), the cast remained intact for Half Blood Prince. Nine years and six films is a long time for a cast to stay together, especially when they're as young as most of this cast was when the series began, so the fact that they're still together is beyond amazing.

The Harry Potter team continues its casting coup in Half Blood Prince. Royal Shakespeare Company veteran Helen McCrory (Becoming Jane, Enduring Love), who was initially cast as Bellatrix LeStrange in Order of the Phoenix but had to drop out due to pregnancy, joins the cast as Lestrange's sister Narcissa Malfoy. The cast member that everyone was talking about, though, was Oscar winner Jim Broadbent (Iris, Hot Fuzz) as Horace Slughorn. At the time of Half Blood Prince's release everyone expected Broadbent to get at least a nomination for Best Supporting Actor, and, while he didn't get nominated, he delivered the best performance the series has known. In fact, all the actors in the series give their best performance to date in this film. Even Michael Gambon finally gets Dumbledore right!

It's also great to see Quidditch back in the series after being noticeably absent from the last two films and just barely present in Prisoner of Azkaban. The sequences are shot better than in the first two films, and depict the game as much more brutal, having more in common with rugby than it appeared to before. The addition of Ron to Gryffindor's team is brilliant. I'm also glad that we get to see more of Alan Rickman's Severus Snape than in previous installments. In Goblet of Fire, besides a few speaking lines, he was relegated to a moment of physical comedy with Harry and Ron, and he was barely present in Order of the Phoenix.

While Half Blood Prince didn't quite catch up to Order of the Phoenix in box office receipts, it's still the third-highest grossing film in the series and was the second-highest grossing film of 2009 with $936 million earned worldwide. According to Rotten Tomatoes, this installment of Harry Potter is ranked the third highest, critically-speaking. It seems a lot of critics felt as though this film worked more as a placeholder in the series than as a standalone film. That criticism isn't too far from the truth, yet J.K. Rowling said that this is the best film based on her books yet.",1290556800,3,3927,4.743777452415813

3275584,3,B000ZECQ08,"Through five previous films, this title, and two more to go, we've watched our little friends and the actors who portray them grow up before our eyes!  This, in itself, has made the series fun and enjoyable.  I read the books, and enjoyed the previous film adaptations, but this was the first film I left the theater disappointed.

The original film tried to pack every detail from the book into its already lengthy running time, resulting in a breakneck pace that gave the viewer little time to really hone in on the characters.  The following two films, in my opinion the pinnacle of the film series, found just the right beat, with few sacrifices.  The fourth film, based as it was on a book three times longer, still managed to bring a fantastic adaptation, even with drastic amounts of material cut. The fifth film, Order of the Phoenix, was the first I thought should have been better, even while subsequent viewings have made me appreciate it all the more.

But now, the sixth film in the series, I found myself for the first time really feeling disappointed as I left the theater, feeling like the whole thing was a waste of time.  My second viewing, here on DVD, went much better, yet I STILL feel the end of this film is a huge letdown.

The key to enjoying these latter films is divorcing them completely from the books.  If you overlook the glaring amount of material missing and just take them as their own creations, they are quite enjoyable.  Bearing that in mind, for the purpose of this review, I will not be referring to the book anymore - that approach is already done to death here.  The book is the book, the movie is the movie. Yet even with this tactic, HALF-BLOOD PRINCE, comes up short.

The film begins with Harry meeting Horace Slughorn, the new potions professor, who Dumbledore wants Harry to get close to in order to retrieve a secret memory regarding Voldemort's days at Hogwarts.  With this information, Dumbledore hopes to reveal the Dark Lord's weakness to aid in the coming final battle.  This, in a nutshell, is the thrust of the film. The first two-thirds contain all the usual charm and fun we've come to enjoy in the series.  Best of all, the content has matured with the characters, so the humor is not nearly so childish, nor are the themes.  There are some truly terrifying images in this film (particularly a disturbing near death experience encountered by one of the female students midway through).  The majority of the film, in other words, works quite well.

The problem is twofold:  firstly, at this point Ron and Hermione are nearly side characters, whose scenes come and go quickly, as though getting them out of the way.  The story is now focused almost solely on Harry's quest to overcome Voldemort.  This leaves little for Ron and Hermione to do but get embroiled in romance problems in the background. Other beloved characters, such as Hagrid, Crabbe and Goyle, Neville, and the Phoenix members are reduced to mere cameos.  Some, like the Durselys, are wholly absent.

The larger problem, though, comes in the film's final conflict.  Whereas ORDER OF THE PHOENIX built to one of the most jaw-droppingly awesome moments in the entire franchise, the finale of this film was markedly less exciting.  Without giving too much away, we learn that one student's entire year came down to setting one series of events into motion, yet we never really see what was so vital in what he was doing.  When it comes down to it, the deed needing to be done is carried out by someone who was already at Hogwarts all along.

Furthermore, when we learn who the titular ""half-blood prince"" is, it's almost an afterthought.  The character literally says, ""yes, I'm the half-blood prince"" and then walks off the scene.  No follow up, no conversation about what this means and why its important.  It's a tremendously weak moment in an overwhelmingly weak ending.  Worst of all, unlike the previuos films, we are left with no real concluding moment - just more of a ""to be continued"" style ending, much like the FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS ending.  Perhaps the concluding films will make up for this, but as it stands, the film is almost completely undone by this underwhelming ending.

To compound matters, the image quality is horrendous.  The film itself was lit and graded very darkly, but coupled with Warner Bros. typically shoddy transfer, and you are left with a badly artifacted, dark, and dreary image most of the way through.

At the end of the day, even with a lackluster ending, I still enjoyed the film, even if it stands currently as the weakest in the series (to be fair, the book is also my least favorite).  Coupled with the poor image, its hard to endorse this product.  I feel generous giving it three stars, but that is totally due to the quality of the actors, music, effects, and direction.  Thankfully, these areas still stand firm!",1290384000,,4882,4.7
3275585,3,B000ZECQ08,"It's unfortunate that this ended up being such a disappointing installment in the series because at times it's so promising. Director David Yates definitely seems to have been the biggest fan of the books of any director who has made a HP movie, and this is incredibly well made. The amount of detail in here and the way this wizarding world is brought to life is pretty stunning. Half Blood Prince is the 4th shortest book of the series as well, which has given the filmmakers time to include almost all the major events of the book.

...almost. Then you get to the final act, which is as big an example of ""dropping the ball"" I think I've ever seen. But I'll get to that. Half Blood Prince was, in my opinion, one of the least-interesting books of the series. It featured tons and tons of flashbacks and aside from that, not all that much happening. It was loaded with teen romance and honestly I can't stand that stuff. I actually give the filmmakers credit for trimming a lot of this out. We got just the right amount of Voldemort flashbacks, we got ...still a little too much romance, but it was at least not as unbearably annoying as it was in the book. Where the book Half Blood Prince amazed, though, was its ending. The last few chapters were some of the most intense, powerful, and surprising in the entire series. And unfortunately, the filmmakers seemed to have butchered them at every opportunity. Just when scenes like the one inside the cave begin to get even remotely exciting, they abruptly cut away. The scene on top of the tower totally lacked the intensity it needed, and the performances of two key actors in this scene....what were they thinking? The confrontation down at the cabin, same thing....I don't understand what the filmmakers hoped to achieve with this scene as it was shot, but it doesn't make any sense, emotionally. The story's big reveal is then handled so casually (and with no explanation whatsoever) that it's almost laughable.

A main character does die in this film, and the amount of weight this is given is almost mindbogglingly small. Again, what were they thinking?

The entire book built up to its final chapters. The movie attempts to as well, but unfortunately, this ""final part"" was butchered almost to the point of irrelevance. These ""intense"" final moments are so low-key that it almost feels like the actors are sleepwalking. Half Blood Prince is a good movie as you're watching it, and I found myself enjoying it, but then the last 15-20 minutes happen, and the movie just ends and you're left feeling, ""....that's it?""",1290211200,2,2573,4.700665188470066
3275586,4,B000ZECQ08,"Good movie. It should have been done in two parts like, ""The Deathly Hallows"", is being done because sooooo many good parts had to be edited or left out completely.",1290211200,,164,4.5
3275587,2,B000ZECQ08,"Watching Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince, is like listening to a children's choir where all the children are a little off key. Each Harry Potter contains a lot more material then can be put into a movie. The difficulty is choosing what to put into the movie and then sanding over the parts you miss. As the novels have gotten larger, the job of the film makers has gotten more difficult. However, up until this point they have done a reasonably good job of finding a rhythm that works in telling the broader story (even if it is a little different then that of JK Rowlings).
With this film it feels like they didn't know what direction they were going in and ended up trying to do too much, but ended up not doing enough. Characters like Hagrid and Prof Mcgonagall who played larger roles in earlier movies are now just given cameos. It might have been better had they just left the characters out entirely so they could create a less fragmented story line without as many distractions. They also spent way too much time on Quidditch (which JK Rowling even said she only put in for the fans) and the teen romances.
This wouldnt have mattered if they had not glimpsed over key areas. 1) They spent so little time explaining the significance of the potions book, to the point that most of the people that didn't read the book had no idea who the half blood prince was after the movie. 2) They left out most of the lessons that Harry had with Dumbledore and shortened the ones they did show. These lessons are so key to book 7, I hope that the audience will be able to follow along.
There seemed to be some bad casting with the Prof Slughorn and the young Tom Riddle characters. Each year a new colorful character is brought in for the DATDO teacher. Lockhart, Moody, and Umbridge in particular are some of the most colorful characters I know of and have provided ample material for the movies. Slughorn shouldn't be any different. Slughorn should come off as a sort of 19th century politician or aristocrat. He should be round, proud, jolly, but also cunning. Instead he is thin, aloof, and awkward. I wonder if Jim Broadbent has read and loved these books, or if he is simply looking for another notch on the resume and paycheck in the bank account. Then Tom Riddle was played like the kid from the Omen. Noone would ever believe this kid was anything other then trouble and he does not seem that clever. I thought that Christian Coulson in the Chamber of Secrets really captured tom riddle better as charming, handsome, and mature.
Finally, I have to admit that it isn't just the new actors. All of the actors were off key. Even the main trio and seasoned actors like Michael Gambon who have played brilliantly in previous movies felt flat. It is almost like they are tired of the movies. I just hope that the seventh and eighth film show more heart, because these actors will never get another opportunity.",1289779200,,2914,4.510396975425331

Some of the dialogue was also weird and the non-urgency of Hagrid and Snape in the cursed necklace and Sectumsempra scenes, respectively, was off-putting.

But the best acting of the young stars (with the exception of Bonnie Wright) can be found here, particularly: Tom Felton, Dan (especially in the Felix Felicis scene), Rupert (with his comedic timing), and Emma (with the canary scene being a highlight).

The Good:
-Alan Rickman as Snape is just perfect as always
-Cinematography wasn't that bad either

The Bad:
-Harry is a whiny brat
-Hermione is totally useless
-Ron seems to be the focus when it clearly isn't supposed to be
-The Death of Dumbledore isn't done well at all
-Draco Malfoy is a whiny b***h who can't do anything without crying
-The movie is BORING!!!!
-Still have one more book to cover....

This is honestly one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  Almost everything about it just sucks, and the absolute worst part is, there is still two more movies.  Yeah, the last HP book is so damn long that it needed to be split into two movies!  Hate this movie, dreading the next two.",1282435200,4,954,4.448275862068965

3275619,5,B000ZECQ08,"I was not a fan of director David Yates's adaptation of ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"", which was a disjointed mess that got neither the feel nor the substance of the book correct, so I was not optimistic about this sixth film in the Harry Potter series. The return of series scribe Steve Kloves seems to have made a big difference, because this movie does a great job of keeping all of the complex character interplay intact even as large chunks of plot are lost along the way. These characters felt like the characters I'd read in the books, and I care a lot more about that than having every scene from the book reproduced, however fleetingly. This is probably the least action-heavy of the movies so far, but if you don't care about the characters by now, why are you still watching?

The cinematography for the film went through a belaboured process. Cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel originally intended a very dark, very monochrome -- almost black and white -- look for the film. After seeing how far in that direction Delbonnel had gone, they panicked and ordered the unique look scaled back, with the color saturation boosted back up considerably. The result is a beautiful looking film, but NOT a natural looking film. The picture remains very dark, with a lot of detail lost to the shadows that there's no way of getting back. The midranges are anemic, because there simply wasn't that much detail to bring back in the first place. This is how the film looked in theaters and is NOT a fault of the Blu-ray presentation. It's how the movie's supposed to look, even if that look isn't everyone's cup of tea.",1280102400,3,1627,4.649305555555555

3275629,3,B000ZECQ08,"I agree that Half-Blood Prince is by FAR the most boring film in the entire Harry Potter series.  This is because the entire film has a very quiet and uninteresting storyline, a noticeably dull atmosphere, and a familiarity that's getting quite annoying by this point, to be totally honest.  Almost like they're milking the Harry Potter series for all it's worth.  A movie like this makes such a theory seem VERY likely.

In addition to the movie just being boring to watch (among other problems) the majority of the film has a ""been there, done that"" feel to it.  The walking footsteps that appear whenever Harry Potter opens up a map?  Been there, done that.  The images of people moving inside the picture frames?  Yes, we've seen that several times by this point, and yes, at one point it was really cool to witness but now it's just repeating the same old formula that made the Harry Potter series successful in the first place.  The famous broom game?  Yes, it's here (though only seen in brief moments).

Another annoying aspect of Half-Blood Prince is the way Harry Potter and his friends carry on the most pointless conversations imaginable concerning girlfriends and friendships.  The entire first half of the film deals with this, and it's really totally unnecessary.  We're talking about an hour and a half of this specific storyline.  NOT good.

Also, there's hardly any special magical effects that involve Harry Potter and his friends casting bizarre spells. This means the adventure and fun has been almost completely sucked out of it.  Furthermore, there's no really big dramatic finish involving Harry battling some exciting and dangerous creature.  Nope, none of that takes place.

To give one example, Harry and friends stumble upon a huge tarantula.  Instead of something neat taking place possibly involving Harry's magical long list of spells bringing the creature to life, it's just a boring conversation between all the characters and a howling dog.  Incredibly dull.

I shouldn't have to read the books either because I've been following along to the movie series the entire time.  If I have to read the books, that means the movie writers didn't do their job in delivering a satisfying storyline.

You also have to understand that since I've been following the Harry Potter movie series since the very beginning, it makes perfect sense that I should expect a dramatic and exciting conclusion out of each movie in the series because that's the successful formula they've been using.

This film is a really big letdown, and I think it's time for the series to stop for good.  Enough is enough guys.",1276992000,3,2623,4.906818181818182

There's another problem with Half Blood Prince. Though Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson had their English accents from the beginning, I could always understand them. Not this time. They fumfer and mumble and I could not comprehend anything they said. The older Brit actors--Michael Gambon, Alan Rickman, Jim Broadbent, etc.,--are fine in this regard. The acting is terrific, and Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy is genuinely affecting. The big set pieces--attack on The Barrows, ""Inferi Island,"" the--well, this CAN'T be a spoiler by now but look away if you've been hibernating--murder of Dumbledore (though the subsequent chase and splendiferous funeral from the book are missing). The most entertaining parts of the movie are the ones dealing with Ron and Harry's slow realization of which girls they love.

3275637,4,B000ZECQ08,"In the excellent fifth movie in the series, the kids face danger and death for the first time. The sixth movie adds the perils of romance. The best parts of this movie are when the kids are coping with love, be it unrequited or over-affectionate. Radcliffe (Harry) and Watson (Hermione), at least, have really grown into their roles; Grint (Ron) does a pretty good job as well, though he's rather handcuffed by the role of buffoonish sidekick. When called upon for a serious performance, though, he comes through.

The usual cast of regulars are terrific, with the addition of Jim Broadbent as Slugworth fitting in perfectly. The story moves along quickly, leaving out some of the nuances of the book. I would have liked to have seen more of Voldemort's childhood, as is revealed in the book, but the important bits are there.

Sadly, the special features on this DVD set aren't all that special. The additional scenes are mostly filler here and there--they look like they were trimmed off the beginning or end of other scenes rather than being full scenes in their own right. And there's not much else on the disc of interest.

Not such a bargain at $9.99 after all since I now need to go buy a new DVD if I want to watch the movie again without all the problems.

I'd like less lovey dovey, more bone-crushing magical action, please.

Yours in wizarding,

Me

While I found this movie entertaining, I thought it was more of a logistical backflip than a great movie in its own right. I recall that one of the things that impressed me the most about this book in the series was its deft set-up for the final installment. The movie operates in much the same way. Though there is some plot action going on (most notably, Dumbeldore's death), the primary purpose of this part of the tale is to put all the pieces in place for a grand finish.

There was an emphasis on the raging hormones of all the characters in this movie, but I thought it a bit overdone and oversimplified. Less love and more story, please!

Effects were great, with the horcrux scene in a gloomy cave being particularly noteworthy. I was also impressed with the actor who played Voldemort/Tom Riddle at 16, Frank Dillane. Beautiful, with just the right touch of creepy. Worth seeing, but I'm much more excited about the coming two movies. Hope they don't screw them up.",1273449600,,1091,4.65625
3275644,5,B000ZECQ08,"But he does, in the sixth installment of the Harry Potter epic. Once you read the seventh and final book, Dumbledore's death becomes clear in the context of his own story: you could say that he was already dead - just on borrowed time (given to him by Snape, the character we all love to hate). Of course, with such detailed and complex stories it's always a challenge to bring them to the screen in a way that makes sense, and especially for HP and the Half-Blood Prince it's essential to have read all the books up to and including this one before you see the film. The backstories, the build-up, the carefully crafted plots and subplots and all of their twists and turns can become muddled and confusing without having read the books first, but the filmmakers have done a good job delivering the story. There are a few changes which don't seem to make a lot of sense; for instance the burning of the Burrow, and an anti-climactic kiss between Ginny and Harry in the Room of Requirement, but overall the story is as exciting on film as it is in the pages. What's really noteworthy about the climax of HBP is that Harry has all along been saying Snape and Draco are the bad guys, and lo and behold it looks as if he was finally right. But is he really? Look for the upcoming film versions of The Deathly Hallows, but read it first! Two or three times!

I really enjoyed the Harry Potter books, and the audio books(with Jim Dale Narrating) even more. This movie, as well as the previous ones, are simply an attempt by some screenwriter to get his name up in shining lights. The story is quite different from the books. I realize that much has to be cut from the books in order to make it into a reasonable length movie, but there are many parts in the movie that were changed, as if for no other reason but that the screenwriter could get away with it.
For instance:

 The beginning of this movie has Harry in a local shop, (not in the book) and has cut out any reference to #4 Privit Dr. This opening could have been done much better in the time allotted. Quite frankly the beginning of the book is the funniest part in the the whole book.

 The train ride to Hogwarts is changed considerably, with no real apparent reason to do so. This whole section has been reduced to garbage.

 The book has Tonks finding Harry on the train, but the movie has Luna Lovegood doing it. Since Tonks is not cut entirely from the movie, this really doesn't make any sense.

 The Burrow is burned to the ground in the movie, which has nothing whatsoever to do with the book. Stupid.

 All of the battle at Hogwarts has been cut.

 The part in the tower bothers me the most I would say. The book has Harry immobilized through this whole part, unable to do or say anything. The movie however, has Harry just standing there, while Snape and Draco do their thing. Absolutely stupid. It really goes against what Harry's character is all about.

 It seems that none of the students are now required to wear robes. They are all running around in either suits, or jeans and a tee shirt.

None of these changes needed to be made, really. It wouldn't make one bit of difference as far as time or money. It is a dreadful shredding of what is one of the better books in the series, and the changes really just serve to deaden the story line, and set up another two dreadful movies to come. I will not be paying to see those in the theater for sure.

Foolish screenwriters. What a waste. The movies keep getting worse and worse.

The acting has gotten, if anything, worse in Radcliff's case. He always has a stupid grin on his face, as if he finds the whole thing very funny. As he is supposed to be in some very dire circumstances in this movie, it really just ruins the effect completely.

 I did like Rupert Grint's handling of Ron's character. I thought he nailed it.

What bothers me the most, is that all the young fans that made Rowling rich, are expecting a decent representation of the the books put into film. They are all so excited to see these films. Instead what they get is a great disappointment.",1271635200,17,2853,4.375711574952562

Anyway, I did not like this movie as much as the others. There were too many things, important things, which are in the books that did not show up at the movie. For instance, I felt showing Lord Voldemort's past about his family from his mother's side, and his mother's story would have added to the movie. There were more memories in Dumbledore's pensieve that were central to the story that the movie did not show.

Again, I enjoyed the earlier Harry Potter movies more than the recent ones. I am not fond of the director, David Yates, that has been directing (badly) the latest installments.

Also, I missed the portrayal of a young Tom Riddle by Christian Coulson from ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets."" Nothing against the new actor playing a young Lord Voldemort, but I felt that the former was better suited for the role.

Otherwise, great movie. I am very much looking forward to ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.""",1270684800,2,1080,4.556701030927835

I understand not everything can be placed in the films.  However that being said.. The Half Blood Prince film adaptation was the worst... The book was gripping and exciting filled with all the things we have come to expect from the HP universe.. The film strips all that down and takes away a lot of what needed to be seen... and even adds things that either don't happen until later in other books or things that never happened...

3275661,1,B000ZECQ08,"This movie is horrid. I waited so long to watch this movie, and was really excited to see it. I wasn't a big fan of 'The Order of the Phoenix', but even though alot of the story was changed or left out, it wasn't to the extent of this piece of garbage. From the first scene in which Harry was sitting in a diner getting hit on by a waitress, I knew that things were not looking good. What happened to the opening when Dumbeldore picks up Harry from the Dursley's house, and explains about him having to live in their house until he was 17 in order for him to remain safe? Is that not important to the story? What about Dumbeldores blackened hand, and the mystery behind it? And for goodness sakes, why on earth was that man for Slughorn cast? He didn't fit the description of him at all, and in the beginning in which Dumbeldore takes Harry to 'convince' Slughorn to teach at Hogwarts, is so awkward and with no explanation, it was confusing. So much was left out, Fleur and Bill weren't even mentioned or seen in the movie and the next book begins with their wedding. I wonder how that will be explained.. The ending was by far the worst part of the movie ever. You had Harry prowling around while Draco and Snape took care of Dumbeldore and what is really amusing is that nobody seemed to care. Snape strolls out of the school with his Deatheater buddies like they're going out for a cup of tea and Harry reluctantly follows them. The gripping climatic ending was missing, Dumbeldores funeral was bypassed so that all the wizards and witches could hold up their wands like 'candles in the wind' in memory of Dumbeldore. So LAME!

I could go on and on with one scene after the other about how it either wasn't relevant, or was completely changed. Id say that out of a 2 1/2 hour movie, only 10-20 minutes were actual things from the book. I kept on wondering while I was watching this travesty of a film, if I would have liked it if I hadn't read the book; and my conclusion was, NO. The movie was sooo boring, and disjointed with most of the plot left out, jumping from one unexplained scene to the next, and with additions that made absolutely no sense (why was the burrow burned?) Even the characters seemed dull and lifeless. I saw no emotion from anyone, and all the interaction seemed like no one cared.  Maybe they knew that the adapted story was horrendous and they just didn't give a damn. I really don't understand why the movie was vastly different from the book. They really weren't kidding when they said 'based on a novel', 'extremely loosely based' would be a more accurate description. Boo hoo, for the screenwriters and director, this movie was really insulting to Harry Potter fans. If I was able to give it 0 stars I would.",1269388800,6,2743,4.4189723320158105

3275664,5,B000ZECQ08,"Books and movies have different strengths and weaknesses. What works in one medium may very well not work in another. The pacing is also different - books can read at the pace of the reader; movies are watched in one sitting.

I have read the book but it was five years ago when it came out. Frankly, I wouldn't be the best person to ask how well the movie follows the book. I do think the movie captures the essence of the book quite well. The major themes of the book seem to all be there. I think it's only fair to judge the movie by how well it succeeds as a movie.

The movie (like the book) has the difficult task of setting up the grand finale while being entertaining in its own right. This it does brilliantly. New cast member Jim Broadbent is outstanding as the inherently decent but weak Horace Slughorn. The returning cast are also at the top of their game. Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy really shines here. He plays the anguished and conflicted Draco Malfoy for all it's worth. Draco seems to be a lot more sympathetic here than in the book. This is no doubt the filmmaker's intention; we'll have to wait to see how this plays out. Michael Gambon as Dumbledore is also great. The ""three"" effortlessly handle their roles. Radcliffe and Grint are especially good when ""under the influence"".

The only reservation I have about recommending this movie is that the previous five installments should be watched to get the full impact of the film.

3275675,3,B000ZECQ08,"This franchise is one of the few that can safely refute the old adage that sequels are never as good as the original.  Indeed, it's something of an amazement how the Potter franchise has managed to maintain such quality of filmmaking after so many sequels.  I think that's why interest is still so high for these films after so many years and probably why the final book is being split into 2 films, to milk it for all they can - not to imply the story isn't worth it; I'm glad their are two more films to look forward to rather than just one.  But, as with most of the other larger book translations (eg. Goblet of Fire) there was a lot of interesting moments cut from the film rendition that we can only hope may someday be restored in the eventual ultimate BD editions ala the first two films (assuming they were actually shot).

As is, the sixth film in the Potter franchise plays more like a filler to build anticipation for the final installments, than a self-contained story with a unique and notable purpose of its own.  The series has become progressively darker and more mature with each installment and this is no exception.  Gone is much of the innocense and naive wonder that built this esoteric cobblestone world.  But for those of us so enthralled, seeing it visually imagined as capably, dare I say, brilliantly, can be reward enough (assuming the final chapters make up for the story that this one lacks) even if there is little payoff in the end.

As for the BD, I think Warner's authoring has gradually improved over the past couple of years.  The days of their masters being biased for the limitations of the DVD format seems to be drifting further and further behind - at least for new release titles.  Most of their catalog HD offerings still tend to be a little lacking in detail - often more than a little.  But with films that have been recently mastered like this one, there's little reason to complain, based on 1080p/24 projection onto a 100"" screen (smaller displays will no doubt be more foregiving, just as larger projected images could magnify problems I didn't notice or at least didn't find too cumbersome).",1267747200,2,2141,4.593175853018373

I'm not sure why he felt it necessary to not only rewrite the book's story line but to reinvent the environment.  Hogwarts, the Weasley house and their surroundings have no continuity to previous films.  Why?  Like most fans I looked forward to this movie.  I held off until I could get the special edition which I preordered.  I was so disappointed after watching the first hour or so that it took me over two months to finally watch the whole movie.

3275680,3,B000ZECQ08,"I agree with Geoff. I love the Potter series and I love the movies... until this one. I was positively mortified and left hanging with a lifeless conclusion of an almost unrecognizable movie; butchered by Yates.

While I realize things have to be omitted and trimmed for reasons of time and expense, there was no excuse for the butchering this Director Yates did to this movie. He didn't trim... he decided to rewrite the entire book to his own version... as if he thought he could do a better job than a billionaire author? It had nothing to do with saving money either. Did it not occur to him that hundreds of millions of fans had already read the book and were expecting some semblance of similarity between the movie and the book? Did they think they would win brownie points with ANY of us by butchering our story? We don't go to the Potter movies to see something different. We go to see a video version of the books we read because we enjoyed the books... not a hack job by some hack director trying to rewrite the series. Where the heck were the executive controls at WB who should have been watching what Yates was doing? And who did Yates blackmail to get the last 2 movies after what he did to this one? It certainly was not a case of talent on his part.

I had to reread the book to make sure I didn't miss something. The things this director did to butcher this movie did nothing to improve the story or save money and were completely unnecessary. We have to wonder if Yates ever bothered to read the books. I shudder to think what this poor excuse for a director will do to the final two movies. We'll watch it because we have no choice... but I can guarantee, after the Potter films, I will never, ever watch another movie directed by Yates... ever again. I hope everyone else boycotts his future ambitions as well.

Burning down the Weasley's home... what purpose did that serve except to upset all of the fans? It was disrespectful like having someone spit on your family heirlooms. It did nothing to improve the movie or ""move along"" the progress of the movie. It had no useful purpose whatsoever and certainly did not please any of the movie fans and wasted the original Christmas scene... which would not have required as many expensive CGI's as this distorted Yates version used.

Same with the exclusion of the interaction with the Dursely's and Dumbledore... so instead this terrible director has Harry hanging out in the underground metro diner hitting on some waitress while reading the daily profit out in the open... while Dumbledore appears outside the metro station dressed in his usual Wizard robes for all the muggles to see.... Not only was this totally in contradiction with the book, it served no useful purpose except to leave the entire audience wondering if they were watching the right movie. A dud of an opener.

The exclusion of Kreacher and Harry's inheriting Sirius's home made no sense whatsoever. Kreacher is a big part of the final book.
There is no semblance of a relationship between Harry and Ginny. That entire endeavor has fallen flat and nothing they can do will spark that part of the storyline now. There is zero magic between them. In fact, there is much more magic between Neville and Ginny than there is with Harry. Every relationship they have tried with Harry has been a dud. Hermione would have been the only one which might have worked.
The relationship with Lavender and Ron was just terrible. Talk about ""over acting!"" They could have cut that part out and none of us would have missed it.
Neville was almost nonexistent in the movie and that's a shame. He adds a lot to the stories.
Cutting out all of the storyline about Riddle's family was cutting out the heart of why Voldemort is so obsessed about hating muggles and the hypocrisy of it.

Then there was this ridiculous Yates version of the potions book. Like others have commented... Snape didn't even react to Harry nearly killing Malfoy. He didn't even act upset as he calmly healed Malfoy's wounds... and unlike the book, Harry wasn't even punished. Part of that punishment would have given Harry an insight as to how cruel his own father had been toward Snape.

Yet, Yates completely changed the story where Harry put the book in the room of requirement with the Tiara on top of it... which is critical for the ending of the final book. It is substituted with some ridiculous scene with Ginny hiding the book... ending with a flat moment of meaningless intimacy.

The worst moment of the movie by Yates is where Harry remained quietly below, watching while Dumbledore was being accosted and killed... where in the book, he had been paralyzed by Dumbledore and covered with his cloak so he could not interfere. I can't see where changing this scene saved a single penny or a single moment of time. What it did was to be completely out of character for Harry to just stand there gaping while his mentor was killed. This was totally unpalatable for fans.

Then, out of the blue, Snape declares himself to be the Half Blood Prince... when there wasn't any reason given in the movie as to why Snape would even be aware that Harry was familiar with that name or the book... other than the fact that he had used one of his own spells on him... but there was no connecting storyline in the film that made his statement make any sense. It was just blurted totally out of context.

The big let down was the ending. There was no ending. It just faded away without any climax or closure. It ended with a dud.

I don't know what WB is thinking... but they are allowing Yates to make enemies out of millions... hundreds of millions of fans. That is a huge fan base to upset just to protect some hack director who is butchering the most popular series of books ever published. I cannot imagine where their heads are... certainly not anywhere we can describe in public... Just like the idiots who cancelled Star Trek... a billion dollar franchise. Shallow thinking pitbulls who can't leave a good thing alone... and then blame everyone but themselves when they shoot themselves in the foot.

Yes... we go to the Harry Potter movies expecting to see what we read in the book with the understanding that they don't have time to include everything. We do not go to the Harry Potter movies to see the story changed or rewritten.

There is only one thing that all the fans would agree on having rewritten.... and that would be to use the resurrection stone to bring back Sirius, Dumbledore and everyone else who was killed in the series... including Harry's parents and Snape. If WB and Yates want to change something... then change that! That is the one change we would welcome... and it might be enough to salvage WB's reputation from this hack job they allowed to be perpetrated on our movie series.",1266969600,83,6804,4.5855263157894735

3275684,1,B000ZECQ08,"Harry Potter books have captured the hearts and minds of many people around the world for a reason. The further into the story the books delved the more remarkable the characters and the story line became. One would think that the movie would try to capture this spirit; but, alas, not this time. It was extremely disappointing to watch this film. I'm not sure where the director for this film - David Yates - was dug up, but I have never seen anyone mutilate the story as successfully as this man has done. In my opinion the movie didn't show a story, it flashed a bunch of flash cards (episodes) that were quite mediocre in their content. The scenes were a collection of action shots that had very little joining them together.
  The second biggest gripe I have with this director is miscasting of characters. He was a director in previous Harry Potter film and I didn't care for his choice of Dolores Umbridge, but this time he managed to outdo his previous poor choice - the character of Professor Slughorn was completely miscast and misrepresented in comparison to the character shown in the book. Professor Slughorn was one of my favorite characters in this book - his wit, his shrewdness, his talent in potion making, his charisma, his little weaknesses (love of good wine, good food and love of the company of the ""movers and the shakers"") all of it completely gone... No reason, just crossed out from existence. Watching the Slughorn's character in the film, you constantly wonder, why would Dumbledore - the greatest wizard of all - would pick such a feeble excuse for a human being teaching these remarkable kids? Oh, yea, it's just because he had this memory. But then why did this looser teach Harry's parents? According to the film, who knows... If you've read the book you know that Slughorn was extremely talented, and even though he belonged to Slytherin house and had his weaknesses, he had principles and was not going to give them up. That was the reason why Dumbledore chose him - his strength of character and his talent, and of course having a special memory was an ""icing on the cake"". But you'll find none of this information in the film.
  My third huge complain is Snape. Throughout the previous films Alan Rickman has captured the audiences with his Snape - stealthy, quiet, coiled up like a snake, striking like a cobra - you could see the passions and hate shining through his eyes. He held his students in the ""iron fist""; order and discipline reigned in his classroom.  This film however made me constantly think ""Is this Snape? What the heck happened to him?"" (and then I would back up and say ""Oh, yea, 'wonderful' film director, that's what happened to him"").  In the bathroom when Harry cursed Malfoy with Snape's curse and walked away, Snape saw it all and has not done a thing, didn't punish Harry, didn't get other teachers involved as he's done in the past at the slightest hint of Harry's misbehavior (and here, mind you, someone almost got killed), didn't torment him, nothing... Just healed Malfoy as if nothing happened and everyone went on their merry way... And of course the ending - where in the book you see all the passions raging inside the man, in the movie Snape just matter-of-factly tells Harry ""I'm the Half Blood Prince"" and walks away, he might as well told Harry ""Never mind this whole wizard war thing, I'll just go get a sandwich"" Where is the passion, where is the climax????
  The whole Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione love stories were as flat, gray and lifeless as a piece of cardboard. I'm not even sure why they were included in the movie, because after looking closely these scenes didn't seem to serve a purpose. They didn't add any depth to the characters (again due to the 'wonderful' director's skills), didn't add anything new or interesting to the story. Probably they were used in hopes to appease the 'chick flick' lovers.
  Having said all that, I still gave the movie 1 star because of the special effects. They were not bad, I did like the way the pensieve and memories were depicted. However, that alone can't make a film.  Considering that David Yates will film the last 2 films in the series, I don't think I'll be going to see them in the movies; will wait for the dvd to come out and borrow from a friend.",1266796800,8,4286,4.633728590250329
3275685,5,B000ZECQ08,"I am a really big fan of the Harry Potter books as well as the films, and I must say that--although Half-Blood Prince was not my favorite film--it was an incredible film. To this day, Prisoner of Azkaban remains the strongest piece of filmmaking in the series; but this one closely follows. For those who gave this film a negative review, I can sympathize; but people have to realize what it entails to make a film. It will never be the book. Of course, the first few films followed their stories quite accurately, but the size of the book has played a huge role. As the books have become progressively bigger, it has become more of a challenge for the filmmakers to adapt the story. I think Yates and Steve Kloves did an exceptional job adapting this book. The scenes that needed to be left in, were, and the ones that weren't were chopped off. Many people have complained that the film was boring, but I do not think that has anything to do with how the movie was made. If the movie followed the book, word for word, people still would have had the same complaint. If you're looking for the thrills and adventure that you got in Goblet of Fire, you won't find it here; this film has more of a narrowly-focused plot, whereas in GOF, there seemed to be too much going on for one film. Here, in HBP, Yates chooses to focus on and play up the relationships (since they will be essential for the last film); he touches on certain aspects of Voldemort's past that give clear enough evidence of his origins and why he turned out the way he did; and he builds up an obvious tension for a climax that will inevitably occur in the last film. Not only does Yates deliver a more subtle film, but he delivers one of the best looking films in the series. The visual tone and cinematography of this film are top-notch, and cannot be compared to any of the other films, except Prisoner of Azkaban.

Give this movie a chance and appreciate it in its own terms. If possible, don't step into it prepared to compare it to the book, because chances are you will be disappointed. Additionally, don't think it will be like Goblet of Fire; the book wasn't even like Goblet of Fire. Many people I know seem to put all the films on a scale with Goblet of Fire, but Goblet of Fire worked more on an action level on par with films such as Transformers and Spider-Man. These stories, as they progress, become more focused on a universal and political dilemma: that Voldemort has returned; and the relationships, because of it, are enhanced and exhibited more fluently. Yes, the films become more dialogue-driven and less colorful; but so do the books. In changing the tone and pacing of the movie, the audience is allowed to witness the threat Voldemort poses in the Wizarding World.

Let this movie take you in; it's an amazing work of art and filmmaking.",1266796800,,2829,4.48062015503876

It left out way too much of the story and I don't know how anyone who hasn't read the book (which is FANTASTIC) could understand even a fourth of what is going on.

The last book in the series (boo hoo!) is being made into two movies and this book should have been too. The film's story jumps all around and makes little sense. The absolutely worse parts start up to, during and after Dumbledore's death. Good grief! How could they leave out Harry's immobility, Dumbledore's army and wizard friends fighting the death eaters, Bellatrix & company, funeral,especially the phoenix lament, etc., etc., etc.

3275699,5,B000ZECQ08,"I constantly and consistently hear complaints from Harry Potter book fanatics about the film adaptions. Oh they left this out! Oh they left that out! It's the same sorry grumbling time after time. And I wish it would stop. The mediums (literary and theatrical) are not 100% compatible. Period. It will NEVER, EVER happen. This movie alone was 153 minutes long, right in line with the rest of the series in terms of length. But this one stands out quite a bit compared to the others for a couple of reasons...

The first is that this is a mature story. As Harry (Daniel Radcliffe,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter-and-the-Goblet-of-Fire/dp/B000Q6ZG52/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</a>), Hermoine (Emma Watson,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prisoner-of-Azkaban/dp/B000Q6ZG5C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</a>) and Ron (Rupert Grint,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Driving-Lessons/dp/B000PAAJW4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Driving Lessons</a>) continue their natural physical growth, so does the story. With age comes interest in the opposite sex, increasing responsibilities, and increased danger. It is this last one that stands out for the film, too. Dangerous and dark, this story is the most muted in terms of fun that any of us have seen so far. Director David Yates (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Girl-in-the-Cafe/dp/B000A59PL0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Girl in the Cafe</a>) pulls off a stunningly stark and surreal landscape that has altered Hogswart from a place of fun and learning, to one of deception and dread.

The second reason this one stands out is that it never spoonfeeds the viewer. If you don't know what something means, or where you're at, or why someone is interested in someone else, well, you're outta luck. But the connections within the film, if you pay attention, will give you all the answers. I applaud screenwriter Steve Kloves for stepping up and giving us an adult fantasy story that, at times, can make you squirm in your seat or jump out of it. I was actually surprised that the film retained a cool PG rating instead of PG-13.

The third reason this film works is that it touches on relationships in a hard way. Fomenting strong bonds with each other, and sticking to them, is not something that is normal in society, and we see the fraying of friendships as they mutate, and watch how death can affect even the sturdiest of hearts.

HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE outstrips all the other Harry Potter films for these very important reasons. And as for the ending? No complaints on that from me, either. I can't wait to see what Harry and his friends do next.",1266105600,,2886,5.880668257756564

This last one was true to the story but the director has left out all of the things that make Harry Potter books and movies fun. No paintings with moving images, no fantastic beasts, we hardly saw Hagrid, and the beauty of the countryside was totally left out in this movie. The director is filming everything darkly, no beauty at all. I think showing the fun side of things makes the bad things that happen stand out even more, so when you take away the good things everything is just a shade of grey.

3275740,3,B000ZECQ08,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is the next to last in the series about the young wizard who is fated to fight the forces of the dark wizard, Lord Voldemort. Earlier films were closer to the story in the book than is this. I admit that as the books got longer it became more difficult to put everything into a 2 hour or so movie.

But this book does hit the high spots, despite some wasted time in scenes not in the book. If you are not familiar with the books and earlier movies you should probably go watch the earlier movies first to get the necessary background to appreciate what is happening.

Harry is asked to secure a vital memory from one of his teachers, a memory that will help Hogwarts headmaster Dumbledore and Harry find a way to stop the evil Voldemort from renewing his war on the wizarding community. Meanwhile, Harry is given a Potions textbook with extensive notes by someone calling himself the HalfBlood Prince. These notes allow Harry to excel at Potions for the first time in his Hogwarts career, to the annoyance of Hermione Grange, witch without peer at the school.

But the Prince, it seems, is not entirely a good wizard....

But more would spoil the story.

The last Potter film will be out soon and you might want to wait until that is available and get the set of 7 that will most likely have tons of extra material. But if, like me, you missed Half-Blood Prince in the theaters this is worth the money.",1265414400,,1441,4.443181818181818

3275766,4,B000ZECQ08,"I love Harry Potter. I am an adult HP freak.

This film is about average as far as the HP film series is concerned, better than Order of the Phoenix, but not up to the quality of Goblet of Fire or Prisoner of Azkaban. A lot of that has to do with the sometimes inexplicable writing and direction. Plot lines deviate from the book for no apparent reason, and others are created where the plot from the book would have been perfectly fine.

The young actors all do great to ok jobs. Bonnie Wright is especially wonderful in her portrayal of Ginny Weasley; although the budding romance between her and Harry is not developed as it is in the book, it's done sweetly and believably. Dan Radcliffe continues to grow as an actor, and there is no question that he is now capable of carrying a film. Emma Watson gives her best performance as Hermione Granger; she is excellent in the scene where she and Harry commiserate with each other about their unhappy love lives. Rupert Grint is adequate as Ron Weasley.

Technically the film is very good. it's the first one I've watched on Blu-ray, and it's quite enjoyable. I was told, before the Oscar nominations, that it would get a Cinematography nomination, and so it did. The music is ok, nothing special. Special effects are very good. One can only wish that, as I said, the direction and writing had been better.

I think that general audiences will love Half-Blood Prince, but that Harry Potter nerds like me will like it but wish it had remained truer to the book.",1265328000,,1508,4.533088235294118

A bit distracting from the movie itself, it was still a treat to listen to them give behind the scenes secrets and tales of how the actors and actresses are on set. Very magical and only happens once a lifetime. As for the movie itself. It is quite brilliant and the darker these movies get the more Im willing to pay for Blu-Ray copies of this series.

If you have not been keeping up with Harry's exploits, this is not the movie to introduce you to his world.  It feels like the middle of the story.  I realize that this is basically a ""middle story"" in the books, but if you are new to Potterworld then you would not want to start with this movie. It begins almost exactly where the last movie ended; It might be a good idea to watch 'Order of the Phoenix' before watching this movie to avoid feeling a bit lost at the beginnning as I did. The story carries on and the end leaves you feeling as if it were unfinished; not really reaching its own resolution but merely a breathing point before taking off on the next HP adventure.
The effects were enjoyable and the story was good.

I hate it when some books are made into movies and they totally change the whole story plot and just use the title.  Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is not one of those horrible 'book to movie' movie.  Actually it is one of my more favorite Harry Potters from the 6 movies so far.  It isn't EXACTLY like the book, but it doesn't go too far off the path as to where I am hating the movie for messing up a scene.  If you like adventure, and some awkward teen moments, you'll like this movie.

You can tell that the main trio (Harry, Ron Hermione) is growing up because the movies are getting a bit darker and such.  and the acting has gotten better through the 6 movies as well",1264982400,,828,4.061728395061729

So much of the book was omitted, the viewer is left with broad gaps in understanding the overall plot.  The film makes great assumptions in viewer prior knowledge and I think it would be very confusing to anyone who has not read the books.

The film does have a number of interesting digital scenes and good visual effects.  Compared to the other films in this series, I would have to rate this one somewhat disappointing.",1264982400,,626,4.417391304347826

This was a major disappointment for those of us who waited all the extra months to see the movie. However, as a ""stand alone, I didn't read the book"" movie, it was great. I can't take away the fact that the movie really was good, once I separate myself from the book. Rupert's (Ron) performance was excellent...I loved it!

A word to the studio...don't make us wait so long for the last two movies...the popularity is fading and you might find you're making a mistake by dragging this out.

It's an embarassment.  Too bad the writer didn't spend more time writing things into the movie that happened in the book rather than writing things out.  I would say that if you read the book, just be prepared to be let down.  Even if I hadn't read the book, I think I would still only give it about 3 starts.  I purchased the Blu-ray set with the digital copy and I dislike the movie so much that I don't think I will even download the free digital copy.  Such a waste.

Director Yates and screenwriter Kloves have taken one of the more trivial of the entries in Rowling's book series and turned it into one of the better films, with a fairly deft hand at comedy and action alike; though obviously large chunks of the book were excised in the transition to screen, the film version of the Half-Blood Prince transfers the essence of Rowling's work to the screen with grace, eliciting few complaints from this fan of the book.

I spent 153 minutes squinting and craning my neck at the screen trying to see what was happening: the film is so dark it looks like they filmed it by candlelight. Absolutely horrid. Whereas the previous films in this series did a reasonably successful job of encapsulating the stories and filling in the back story, this film left out so much important detail that Snape's key pronouncement at the end, that he is the titular 'half-blood prince,' is a whopping 'So what?' moment that seems almost trivial. Great characters and major thematic elements are entirely marginalised or pushed so far to the periphery that the film feels lifeless and void.
Based on this clumsy adaptation, the fact that David Yates is going to be directing the final instalments does not bode well for the finale, unless he can learn to properly light scenes and not gut the story of its impact. Writer Steve Kloves and Editor Mark Day are to blame as well for robbing this film of all the magic viewers have come to expect from this series.

Us fans don't mind, we go and get it/see it anyway. However, I have to admit that I have my favorites. This latest movie is fast becoming one of them. I liked the way this movie was done. Its unrealistic to expect to see everything you read in the book transferred to the screen but I for one think that the movie is sometimes better off with the less is more approach.

This latest addition was cleaver, quick paced, funny and heart retching. It hit all the right buttons and is a testimony to how far a franchise can go if it has the right tools to get it there.",1263686400,,751,4.033557046979865

When I watched it on DVD the only issue I had was that most of the scenes, especially the action ones, were dark, i.e. night or in none illuminated places. I had to turn off all of my lights and close the window blinds and curtains to bring out the characters and scenery in those dark scenes.

As to the content of the movie, it was and will be the darkest of the HP series. There are one or two liberties taken by the screen adaptation that deviated from the story line and may affect the final movies unless some magical type explanation is brought forth.

All in all, a good movie. Not my favorite of the series but true enough to the book to be lauded as more than abdicate.",1263686400,,778,4.1118421052631575
3275834,3,B000ZECQ08,"As a parent who has not read the books but watched the films with my kids more times than I can count, I was looking forward to this film.  They saw it in the theatre and were very critical of it as omitting so much that it made little sense and was not a good cinema experience.

I think that their criticisms are essentially correct.  It was very difficult for me to understand what exactly was going on - there are many sequences that appear to have been filmed with the assumption that viewers had read the book.  What you get are the actors standing there, implying something significant yet explaining only the basics (e.g. the secret that the new character has in his mind, but not what the new character is doing when she forces Snape, with some ambivalence, to take the unbreakable oath).  That greatly lessens the enjoyment for casual viewers like myself.  Moreover, while there is plenty of action, there are many scenes are low key and quiet, with abrupt shifts to new scenes that are awkward from a storytelling point of view (e.g. Harry suddenly appears in Dumbledore's inner sanctum and they are working on memories stored in these vials).  At one point, the bad guys are in Hogwarts and they destroy some stuff and then that is all you hear from them - they just walk off.  It made little sense to me.

One of the strengths of the film is the advancement of the characters' personal lives, as couples begin to form in young love.  This is quite fun and romantic.

REcommended.  We have to follow this to the end, even peripherally interested parents like myself.  You must get it if HP is a part of the family interest/obsession, however weak this film is on its own.",1263600000,,1683,4.514851485148514

I still enjoyed the movie and I'm still a fan, especially when you see the actors grow mentally and physically in front of you. Maybe the problem is also that i feel it's taking so long to do all the stories, while reading them only takes a matter of weeks or months(depending on what kind of reader you are).Because I'm still a fan and i still liked the movie I give it 3.5 stars;higher if it were longer and truer to the book.

3275840,4,B000ZECQ08,"Realizing that you can't possibly cram every moment from the book into a movie short enough for theater owners to want to show or that most people (especially kids) will sit through I think they did a good enough job. The whole issue of the horcruxes was handled well enough as were the romances and Malfoy's angst over having been ordered to kill Dumbledore. I'm a little hazy on why they burned down the Burrow. Maybe to highlight Molly's growing fear of losing her husband or one of the kids but it seems to me they could have done that without the pyro.

That said I do have a couple of issues to vent. The editing was choppy at best. Certain conversations such as Dumbledore/Riddle at the orphanage seemed to have been cut and reassembled in a sloppy manner. It didn't sound natural. My other complaint lies with the omission of the memory dealing with the cup and locket. They're going to have to find a way for them to discover the existence of the cup in the last two movies although it seems to me it could have been handled here in about 90 seconds. Perhaps they're uncomfortable with the CGI of elves.

Anyway I'm not as big a fanatic as a lot of other reviewers so I'm not as easily frustrated. I started collecting these because of my daughter and have only read the last 3 books. She was 10 at the time and we've seen every episode in the theater since the first one. We had a laugh about how she'll be twenty recently about how she'll be twenty by the time we finish up.",1263340800,,1485,4.338129496402877
3275841,5,B000ZECQ08,"Firstly, I am tired of everyone wanting the movies to be exactly like the books. No movie based on any book is an exact replica. And people should be used to the fact that none of the HP movies have included everything from the book... including the first two shortest books.

I believe the viewer needs to distance themselves from the books before entering the theater or putting any of the HP discs in their home theater. Movies and books are different, and should be treated as such. Now, I am a huge Harry Potter nerd and read at least the book the movie is based on before entering the theater (sometimes I read all the subsequent books) but this is for my own enjoyment. Yes, I compare what is different. But a good movie is a good movie. And Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is that.

Hands down this is the best Harry Potter film, even with the book-slashing changes. The kiddos are growing up not just in the story and real-life, but their acting skills have improved immensely, which makes this film easier for an adult-fan to enjoy. There's a lot of comedy relating to teen romance and crushes. I personally thought Lavender Brown was a great addition and does a great job showing how it feels to be a teen and in love. You delve deeper into the Dark Lord's history through Dumbledoore's memory and experience. And it's action-packed from the beginning. In addition, casting Jim Broadbent as Professor Slughorn was genious--he deserves an oscar nod. Malfoy has a more prominent role, as does Professor Snape.

People who haven't read the books may be confused. I found myself explaining some of the details left out to my younger sisters (after they asked me) who find the books boring. But they would have been fine had I not been there. Honestly, I was shocked by some of the absent book parts, but not anymore shocked than I felt after seeing the other movies.

This is my favorite Harry Potter film (previously the Prisoner of Azkanban had been my favorite). Now, I do wonder how they are going to explain a lot of important stuff in the final installments, but perhaps that is why they finally decided to do two parts--one part for book seven, and the other part to tie all the strings together, but combine them so they work as one? Yes, they should have planned better, but the books were only just finished in the summer 2007.

So go out and enjoy this movie as a movie, not as a movie made from a book.",1263340800,3,2428,4.509090909090909
3275842,2,B000ZECQ08,"It's been a long time since I read the book so I can't comment on the many plot elements left out, so I am judging the movie as a movie.  As such I was not impressed.  I will admit that the visual darkness is appropriate to the darkness of the plot, but this seemed to extend into the very acting; EVERYTHING was overlaid by a blanket of darkness and slowness.  It seemed to me that the actors were all told to deliver their lines like apathetic depressed people.  There were so many pauses in the middle of sentences, lines that seemed not to convey their characters appropriately.  Hogwarts ceased to feel like Hogwarts with the removal of all color and light.  Even the most intense and emotional scenes (Harry and Dumbledore at the underground lake and onwards) felt limp and drained.  I hoped for something truly scary at the lake scene, but the book was more intense than what we got!  (OK, I just lapsed into comparing it to the book!)

Yes it has the typical flaws of being a movie based on a long book that has sold millions of copies all over the world. Just like the Lord Of The Rings trilogy, there is more in the book than in the movie. Who would sit through a 12 hour movie anyway?

I won't nit pic the differences between the book and movie. The movie is Dark, both visually and in content. The characters are strong starting with Harry who is a man child suffering both the typical changes that confront a boy's journey to manhood and the demand to be more than a boy in a dangerous setting. You can't really call Hermione and Ron supporting cast. They are strong characters evolving on their own path sharing the journey with Harry through Hogwarts, OoP, death eaters, Voldemort, the Ministry of Magic etc. In actuality I believe that you would enjoy the movie more if you had read the book and vice versa. In fact I can't imagine not wanting to read the books and see the movies.

The movie is very entertaining with great scenery, excellent performances by the cast, strong visual effects, all based on the best series of fantasy books to come in half a century. Buy it! You wil want to see it again and again.",1262995200,,1281,4.378151260504202

This is something that should be given away for free to see if consumers want to pay for an actual quality copy.  This goes beyond bad quality control, this is about a studio not giving a [you-know-what] and hustling away your hard earned money.

Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince*
Well first let me start off and say I was jonesin' to see this movie, i had rediscovered the wonderful world of HarryPotter, about 6 months before HP6's theatrical release, and was anxiously awaiting, and expecting to see the ORIGINAL release in Nov 08. Only to find out about 2 to 3 months before that they decided to move it forward to Jul 09. I WAS FURIOUS!! My blood was boiling. Their excuse was ""summer movie sales are better"" so they knowingly make their die hard fans wait even LONGER and go into HP withdrawal to see this, all for the lust of the money, playing on people (suckers) who wilingly will throw $ at Harry Potter because its such an epic story, Shows how much these movie goons really care about what their patrons think!! -keep this in mind-
The movie-
So the day came when I got to see this movie. (I read the first 5 chapters of the book out of impatience) I sat down and it was almost like the first 15 just flash before your eyes (really choppy) They changed crap around, added unneccesary Politically Correctness, they all seemed different(persona's), the colors are muted (which is cool in its own right, but not very HP'ish)seemed too ""REAL"" for a fantasy movie, I was soooo confused by what was going on that by the time I could figure anything out the movie was over!! Really short movie. It also had that weird gloomyness and un-magicalness that ""Goblet of fire"" had (which is my least favorite HP movie), but it wasn't enough to completely RUIN the movie because that gloomyness is appropriate for HP6, but not the unmagicalness! They drained the fantasy out of this one, and there is plenty in the book! They ALSO spent WAAAAAAAAAY too much time on the foofy la-la love crap, when THAT could have been cut out instead of important key information (in the book) OKAY Voldemort wants to kill yalls asses but your sitting here whispering sweet nothings and playing footsie! The love crap really bugs me, its a real, to me,distraction & unimportant part of the story, and about 50% of the movie is wrapped up in the trio's love strings. I have no Idea how DYates will pull the 7th one off but im scared. Ive watched the movie 4-6 times, I finally just read the entire book to fully understand whats going on.
I don't understand the reinvisioning being done. JUST DO IT LIKE THE BOOK DAMNIT! I know its a book to movie adaptation, but thats exactly what it is an ADAPTATION, make it adapt to fit into a movie! That doesnt mean REINVISION & REWRITE the story according to the director!!! This goes all back to the lack of respect to the loyal consumer/patron, there is no respect, they know they're getting your money regardless, so WHO CARES?!  Now I hear, there is to be ""Nude scenes"" and added scenes not from the book(WHY ARE YOU ADDING? you need to being tying up the s**t you left out!) in the 7th AND part 1 will ""seem more realistic"" MORE REALISTIC?! ARE YOU KIDDING?!! part 2 will be more ""Operatic"" WHAT THE?!?! so are they going to pull that November to July stunt again too?! I wouldnt doubt it!! I tell ya, after the HP saga is done, and the movies are out and I can complete my DVD collection, im done with the movie world! and Im done with MOVIE trends such as VCR 2 DVD 2 BLU-ray! Its a money making machine that I wash my hands of! I will watch ONLY my personal collection & old movies from now on, screw these new trends and the ""I'll do what I want"" attitude from the movie producers and home movie industry! Honestly the only reason I give these crooks my Harry Potter money is because I believe the story IS leged, and it sucks this moron got his slimey little mits on it. Going into this movie HP6, was like buying weed but getting a bag of oregano- Looks like weed but lacks the substance! I don't understand whats going on in David Yates' pea brain, but I see him taking this Flaming torch of a movie saga and dunking it in cold water.",1262908800,3,4012,4.407008086253369

3275908,1,B000ZECQ08,"While many of the other reviews are noteworthy, I'll just bring up the two reasons I couldn't watch this DVD.

1) it was dark.  Not in the sense of ""evil foreboding"" but dark as in ""you can't see what's going on because it's all so badly lit.""  This movie gave me a headache because I was constantly squinting and trying to make out what was happening in all of those dark shadows.  You'd think with all the money the books made they'd be able to afford more than a single flashlight to light all the sets.

2) the DRM made it impossible to watch the whole movie.  If you want to watch this on you laptop or other computer, forget it.  They got this so wrapped up with a terrible DRM that you can't watch it on a computer.  And because the people in congress care more about collecting bribes that representing the people, they actually made it a law that you can't return a DVD once it's been opened.  So if you buy this and discover you can't play it on your computer, tough, you can't return it.

So really, don't buy this.  Don't tolerate bad lighting and crippling DRM.",1262736000,2,1074,4.293532338308458
3275909,5,B000ZECQ08,"Yes, the movie has holes. Yes, even as a Harry Potter fan some parts of the movie make absolutely zero sense. And the add ons of Harry Potter and the Waitress, Dumbledore going to subway tunnels, and Draco and the Bird were a little over played, but I still loved this movie. Why, because it had a lot of Draco in it! I never noticed how hot Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) was. He grew up!

Why else do I love the movie? The visual effects are stunning. The pace is remarkable and I wasn't bored during any part of the movie (although like I said I was a little confused). This is the only Harry Potter movie I had to watch three times inorder to understand it.

Should you buy it? As a Harry Potter fan, yes. As a movie fan, yes. As a graphic designer, yes. As a nerd, yes. Love the movie. Enjoy the movie. It is epic along with the series.

What I wish was different: There was stuff ""added"" from book seven that shouldnt have been in this movie. If you are a big book fan, you know what I am talking about and I don't want to do any spoilers here.",1262736000,,1045,4.063106796116505
3275910,5,B000ZECQ08,"First of all - for those who complain that the filmakers leave their favorite parts from the HP books out of the movies, that's just part of adapting hundreds of pages of text into a workable screenplay and script. The HP movies and books should never be directly compared, nor were they ever intended to be - even Jo Rowling approves of all the plot licenses taken and modifications made for the film adaptations.

That being said, The Half-Blood Prince is the best HP film since the Prizoner of Azkaban. Director David Yates has really got the feel of the HP world nailed down now - he started to get in Order of the Phoenix, but has really got it now. The production and set design is beautiful, and they managed to use the special effects shots to great advantage in the film - as a compliment to the story, not as the star of the show. This is not a special effects movie, it's a great movie with very good special effects (the cave scene is terrifying). To those complaining about the acting - I couldn't disagree more. The kids (Harry, Ron, Hermione) finally got back the great chemistry they had in Prisoner of Azkaban. Dan Radcliff is also finally maturing and showed some real acting chops and great comic timing in the Felix Felicis scenes. Jim Broadbent's performance as Horace Slughorn is the best REAL acting the HP series has seen to date - exceptional work from him.

Then when it actually did end my kids and I said almost in unison, ""That's the end?!?"" Wow. If ever I've seen a movie that was pure filler until the next installment...Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince was it! What a completely forgettable movie.

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, Chamber of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban, Goblet of Fire & Order of the Phoenix were all at minimum very good. Certainly Sorcerer's Stone, Chamber and Goblet of Fire are as memorable as it gets. Azkaban was relatively slow compared to the others, and Order of the Phoenix, was also a bit drawn out, but still pretty good.

The A-list actors giving A-list performances goes on and on in this series of films....You have Richard Harris (GRHS) who was flawlessly and un-noticeably (no disrespect intended) replaced by Michael Gambon; Miranda Richardson, Gary Oldman, there's Alan Rickman doing his best Jeremy Irons imitation, Ralph Fiennes, John Hurt, Shirley Henderson, John Cleese and of course Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid. I know I'm forgetting more, but you get the idea.

Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber were brilliantly led by the direction of Veteran Chris Columbus (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Home-Alone/dp/B00008N6NQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Home Alone</a>&nbsp;and tons more). And the cast of these films?...How often do three unknowns (Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, Emma Watson as Hermione Granger and Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley) walk into overnight stardom? Not very often. But these three sure did. And it's well deserved. Their characters are well acted and believable; not bad for a bunch of preteens whose debuts now seem so long ago.

Azkaban was really good and certainly an integral part of the Harry Potter progression of stories. But Azkaban was the first hand-off of the director baton from Columbus to the short resumed, mostly-foreign-film-guy Alfonso Cuarn (prior to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Children-of-Men/dp/B000N6TX1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Children of Men</a>). Columbus still had oversight as a producer to Azkaban, so perhaps Cuarn felt intimidated by Columbus' brilliance in Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber...or perhaps Cuarn just held back from doing his own thing. Be that as it may, the change in ""direction"" really showed through. And Cuarn was gone for Goblet.

Goblet comes in with three changes in direction: 1) The director change from Cuarn back to another vet in Mike Newell (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Donnie-Brasco/dp/B000NQPZCO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Donnie Brasco</a>), 2) The exit of Columbus oversight, and 3) A shift from...shall we say...a more famlyish Harry Potter to a more dark Harry Potter (the way it was intended!). And this did not go un-noticed by the MPAA.

The Dirctor's Chair went to a relatively inexperienced David Yates for Order of the Phoenix, but at least Yates stayed the course started by Newell and kept the darkness (and the PG-13) in. Yates' directional talents are clearly inferior to his predecessors, and it really shows in Half Blood Prince. Either the main cast has lost their heart or Yates simply could not get out of his cast what they were once capable of. It is mostly Radcliffe's, Watson's, Grint's and especially Tom Felton's (Malfoy) performances that were blatantly lacking. Maybe now that this crew has grown up, it simply turns out that as adults they can't act. But that's where a more qualified director should have come in to finish off what started as a Class-A series.

It must be tough to make a PG movie these days; it's hard to believe that the MPAA took the Potter series from a PG rating to a PG-13 rating starting with Goblet. Kids 13 and under can see uglier violence and hear more profanity at school recess and at the local playground than they do in Harry Potter movies. How is it that a movie like Goblet without a curse-word or graphic act of violence (by today's standards anyway) gets thrown into the same category as, for example,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien-Vs-Predator/dp/B000K0YLLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien Vs. Predator</a>, that does indeed not only have profanity, but strong violence? Ludicrous. But I won't get started on how unfair the MPAA is and how neurotically insane the pressure is from certain groups on the MPAA to ""protect"" our youth.

I will indeed finish by saying that the Harry Potter releases combined have grossed billions of dollars because--up until Half Blood--they're excellent movies that kids can watch too. So stick that in your pipe and smoke it, MPAA. The fair MPAA rating for Half Blood would be NG. Not as Good.

Yates is on board for the final two...that's right, I said TWO...in the Harry Potter series. Deathly Hallows is announced for 2010 and Deathly Hallows Part 2 for 2011. Way to milk it, buddy. Yates had better step it up several notches and get this series back to form if he expects me to fork over the Blu Ray bucks for Hallows instead of waiting for cable.

3275913,1,B000ZECQ08,"This was absolutely the worst HP movie I have seen so far. One does not have to be familiar with the book to see the many flaws of this adaptation - from storytelling right down to acting.
The 'high-school' romance and all the potions and all - it was absolutely ridiculous to focus this much on them. And while Ron Weasley's character has always annoyed me for being one pi55y sourpuss, he got even more on my nerves when he started acting all happy.
Overall, I felt like there was about 30 mins of important material that was poorly presented and explained, and over 1.5 hrs of filler fluff that was painful to watch.
And you'd think Dan Radcliffe would get better with age, acting-wise - he got worse. I laughed throughout pretty much the whole thing, as the entire production is an absolute travesty and cannot be taken seriously.

3275919,2,B000ZECQ08,"I haven't read any of the Harry Potter books, but I thought the original movie was uniquely wonderful.  Like countless others, I was enchanted by its masterful realization of rich archetypal symbolism drawn from a combination of classic British culture and the world of magic.  It was a movie that simply had to be made.

But the subsequent movies have merely attempted to recycle the ingredients from the original, letting them become increasingly stale in the process while adding no worthwhile new elements.  Moreover, instead of being buoyantly magical, the movies have become rather dark, not just in their plot and characters, but even visually, with the original vivid colors now looking faded as though all the events took place at dusk.

This latest movie exemplifies these weaknesses.  The characters are now stereotyped and flat, the plot is unconvincing and doesn't go anywhere interesting, and the overall emotional range is stunted and narrow.  If they wanted to give up on making a good movie and instead just cash in on their lucrative franchise by resorting to fear and cool special effects, they didn't even accomplish that.  The special effects fell short of the previous movies (lowering cost to increase profit?) and boredom was the main effect I experienced.  I had to struggle just to stay awake.  In a word, this movie was drab.

I can't recommend this movie even for mindless entertainment, and I won't be watching the next one unless they somehow get their act together and garner rave reviews.",1262476800,5,1520,5.01593625498008

I even tried switching from the Blu-ray to standard DVD, and tried the Blu-ray on two different TVs and two different Blu-ray players.  All have horrible quality.  I did not see this movie in the theater, but I can only figure no present-day DP would be this poor at lighting a picture.

3275921,5,B000ZECQ08,"Harry and his friends are just a tad older in this movie. Dumbledore turns up inconveniently to spoil Harry's night out with a waitress. This sets up the beginning of a series of frustrating moments for Harry. While Dumbledore's primary mission is to defeat he who must not be named, Harry and his companions must deal with unrequited love.

I will not go into all the details due to the fact that it is fun to see them unfold as the movie progresses. However, I would say this movie has more spellbinding and snogging.

In the ongoing conflicts between book and movie we have consistently seen these movies could be, just a shadow the book in this movie is no different. Yet once again, Helena Bonham Carter plays a perfect Bellatrix.

However, after the second viewing of this movie you will notice that it is consistent and logical. The clues are all there setting you up for the future action. In addition, there is not a wasted scene or word.

I've actually seen this movie in the theater with popcorn and nachos. However, I suggest that you look at the Blu-Ray version and do not miss the extra DVD features. The main feature which is maximum movie mode is a little frustrating at first, as it requires you to press buttons and pay attention to the whole movie again. However once you get used to this feature you find that it does add to the viewers understanding of what they are trying to accomplish in the short time available for this movie.

For those viewers that are inclined to play with technology more than just being a passive viewer this Blu-Ray version also has a BD-live feature. I personally do not find this very useful.",1262390400,,1643,4.555932203389831

3275929,5,B000ZECQ08,"I enjoyed this film more than any of the other Potter films, with the possible exception of Azkaban. Like that film, it has numerous departures from the book, but viewed as part of the series of films (and NOT as a shoe-in for the book in the series of books), it works very well. I know that Rowling had approved the scripts to these films as they were made, so I'm sure that she always had a clear understanding of the consequences of any omissions (and additions) made to the events in terms of the subsequent films. So far, it has worked just fine. Are the negative Potter diehards worried that all these changes will somehow inevitably add up to a bad movie version of the ""Deathly Hallows""?

I very much enjoyed the humor. Scenes such as the tribute to Aragog were hilarious, as well as the little touches - Ron sitting between Harry and Ginny at the Burrow, and Harry being informed of Vane's love potion plans by Hermione, and the brewing of ""Living Death""! Hermione's comments about Harry ""enjoying his dessert"", and her trying to explain to Ron how he split with Lavender during his recovery from poisoning (""I don't believe it was a particularly long conversation"") are also hilariously low key. Lavender's attentions to Ron are comical, and deliberately pitched as almost painful. The effects are convincing, and the actors have hit their stride.

3275931,4,B000ZECQ08,"Based on the sixth book in J.K Rowling's ""Harry Potter"" series, ""The Half-Blood Prince"" first hit the big screen in 2009.

Orphaned as a baby and subsequently raised (in the loosest possible terms) by his Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, Harry's early years were thoroughly miserable. Although he had been told his parents had died in a car crash, they were actually murdered by an evil wizard called Voldemort. Harry, however, somehow survived this attack and Voldemort subsequently disappeared for many years. Harry learnt of his past when he was eleven, and has since been attending Hogwarts - a very prestigious school for training young witches and wizards. The years in between have provided him with some of the happiest moments of his life : he has made friends for the first time - including Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger - and he has become the Seeker on Gryffindor's Quidditch team. The school's headmaster Albus Dumbledore, considered by many to be the greatest wizard of modern times, has become something of a role model to him. Unfortunately, it has also become apparent that Voldemort's disappearance was only temporary - and, while many in the wizarding world have tried to pretend otherwise, his return cannot now be ignored. Furthermore, Harry has now been identified as the `Chosen One' and is destined to battle with Voldemort again - with only one of the two surviving. Despite the enhanced security at Hogwarts, however, Harry can't feel entirely safe there. Professor Snape, the Potions teacher who has picked on Harry from the day he arrived, was a once noted Death Eater...and, despite Dumbledore's assurances, Harry has never trusted him. Draco Malfoy, Harry's arch-nemesis among the student body, is the son of another noted Death Eater...and Harry believes Draco is now following in his father's footsteps. As it turns out, Harry's suspicions may not be entirely groundless...

The film opens with Dumbledore surprising Harry wait a visit, towards the end of the summer holidays...and taking him onwards, to meet a former colleague called Professor Horace Slughorn. Dumbledore hopes he will return to the teaching staff - and has brought Harry along as `bait'. (He has a record of `collecting' talented young witches and wizards - and Dumbledore knows he wouldn't be able to resist Harry). Naturally, he caves in...though a return to Hogwarts would be a great relief to him. Voldemort - who also features in Slughorn's collection of notable past pupils - has desperately been trying to add him to the Death Eaters.

When he arrives back at Hogwarts, however, Harry's surprised to learn Slughorn is taking over as Potions teacher - with Snape finally taking over the Defence Against the Dark Arts job. The shuffle also means that Harry will be able to take both subjects - both are needed for him to become an Auror. (Snape had threatened to keep him out of the NEWT-level Potions class, for not achieving the top grade at OWL Level. Slughorn, on the other hand, is more than happy to accept him). Since he hadn't bought any books for the Potions course in Diagon Alley, Harry borrows an old copy of the textbook from the classroom's store. It puts Harry at an immediate advantage over his classmates, thanks to some very helpful notes made by its previous owner...someone who called himself the 'Half-Blood Prince'. Harry is also getting some additional 'classes' with Dumbledore - where he learns more about Voldemort's past. However, they're not very regular as Dumbledore seems to be spending a lot of time away from Hogwarts....and there is a little homework, that involves working closely with Slughorn.

Unsurprisingly, given the length of the book, not everything makes it into the film. While some of Harry's lessons with Dumbledore are dropped, and there's no mention of Grimmauld Place, the changes and the omissions at the film's climax surprised me most of all...there were a couple of scenes there, I'd have thought, would have been a film-maker's dream. Nevertheless, looking at the film in isolation - rather than comparing it to the book - I did find it very enjoyable. It was very dark and stylish, while Helena Bonham Carter was - once again - outstanding in her far-too-brief appearance as Bellatrix. (I wish something had been done to extend her screen-time. A bit more of Luna would've been welcomed too). Malfoy is no longer the strutting, preening bully, and clearly struggles with what's expected of him throughout the year. Overall, I enjoyed it - while the Potter diehards mightn't be too happy with it, I found it a fun way to pass a couple of hours.",1262217600,,4607,4.963730569948186

Likewise, the setup for Harry using the beozar is effectively absent, where in the book, it's prominent.  The film does carry the fundamental story along, but some of the things that were in the original are minimized or missing.
The film carries the basic storyline along, but it sheds some important details.

Sadly, even the 3 cups of coffee I had today could barely keep me awake for this dreadful, dull  and horribly depicted film.  How it is possible that a franchise with as much going for it as Harry Potter could allow this to happen?

My own two cents:
1.  There was way too much time spent on and with Horace Slugworth.  He had no fire and to watch all his onscreen time was an exercise in patience.
2.  One of my favorite story lines in the book was Tom Riddle's family.  They were so well written and interesting, they could have taken 15 minutes of time from Sluggy and that unfunny running gag of Ron's stalking admirer and invested us in getting to know Tom's people.
3.  I understand the books/films get darker as they progress.  I get this however one of the things I have always loved was the whimsical and magical objects and beings such as Nearly Headless Nick, Moaning Myrtle, moving staircases, howlers and talking paintings.  It's like this was no longer Hogwarts, a school of wizardry but a broken down castle with no element of anything magical.
4.  There are always going to be people who complain about what the film didn't cover and what was in the film but not the book but if you're going to tamper with a book such as HP, MAKE IT INTERESTING.

Let's do this one over.  Can we please?

3275942,3,B000ZECQ08,"I bought this for my daughters for Christmas. They are dyed in the wool Harry Potter fans. My older daughter has read the books twice and the younger one finished the last one last May. That being said I will review their reaction to both the movie and the product, since Amazon insists on combining the actual movie content and multiple product format reviews.

BD Live - Blu-ray disc review: I have read the negative product reviews for this disc complaining about the verticle lines running across the screen. We didn't observe any of this in the copy we received. After reading about the problem I went back and played it again to see if I missed something. Our copy is crisp and clear, everything you would expect from Blu-ray. I noted that the originator of one of these negative reviews provided a subsequent comment that Warner Brothers promptly replaced her disc with a good one, so this must have been a batch problem. We were just lucky I guess. I pre-ordered this disc back in early November at a great price of $15.99. It arrived in plenty of time before Chrismas. Well worth the money.

Movie Review: I enjoyed the movie, having never read the books. I thought it was one of the better movies of the series. My daughters also enjoyed it, however they were dissapointed and downright irate at several points when the movie took off on tangents; like substituting the wrong character for certain scenes, leaving out whole sections, and adding entirely new scenes that were not in the book at all. I can sympathize with their frustration. I have never understood why screen writers feel the need to create completely new content scenes for movie adaptations while dropping valid scenes.",1262044800,24,1697,4.749152542372881
3275943,4,B000ZECQ08,"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince was good, as it (most of the time) stayed true to the novels, with some little sit-com like additions (which I personally am not so fond of). A word of warning: If you have very small children (5,6) they may be frightened by some of the more intense scenes. This IS the darkest Harry Potter movie yet, and you have to keep in mind that the movies get progressively darker, so the next two (as the seventh book is being split into to different releases) will only be darker.

A note on the soundtrack:  I found myself turning it the volume up and down at different points in the movie, as win they whisper it trails off into nothi.... and when the yell it GETS REALLY LOUD!!!! It's inevitable that this happens, I've spoken with others who complain of the same problem.

Personally this is the only format I would by movies on, as the visuals are just so wonderfully stunning.",1261958400,,914,4.428571428571429

3275945,3,B000ZECQ08,"I'm an avid Harry Potter fan, like so many.  This film is definitely a ""cliff notes"" version of the book; probably best if you've read the book beforehand.  (It would have had to be a miniseries to fit in all that the book covers.)  The tone is extremely dark, as the story goes on.  The film is visually dark itself-especially on a smaller screen.  You'll have to dim the lights for some of the scenes at home just to see what is going on.

When I saw the film in theatres, I was dismayed by many of the cuts from the book, and I didn't like the ""new"" scenes.  I still feel that way to an extent, but over time I think I realize that some changes had to be made for pacing and sheer time.  I do think this is an amazing cast, and it's been a treat to watch the kids grow into their roles along with their characters.  I was especially impressed by Tom Felton-who finally had more of a role than comic relief.

I was disappointed that this DVD has NO extras whatsoever.  I don't need 30 hours of behind the scenes stuff, but buyers of this version should know that there is nothing but the movie on this DVD.  No commentary, no interviews, nada.  It's just the film.  I think that they are starting to ""force"" people to buy the deluxe blue ray versions, and I resent that.

All films adapted from books make changes and this is especially true in the Harry Potter series where so many characters exist and the story is both a coming of age teen book and a minor fantasy epic. The problem with the Half Blood Prince is that it does neither well as a film. They added utterly nonsense scenes like the destruction of the Weasley home while doing away with so much of Harry's interactions with his peers like Luna, Neville and even Ginny. Additionally, the way they filmed the movie it makes an incredibly poor showing on home video as it is very dark, not just in setting and tone but the picture as well. Playing it on my smaller television left me utterly incapable of even seeing the picture at times, something that does not happen with any other movie in my collection. All in all, while Half Blood Prince was one of my favorite of the books it is easily the worst of the series and should really only be purchased if you are, like me, the sort of person who has to have the entire collection.",1261785600,5,1118,4.3798076923076925
3275954,4,B000ZECQ08,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood prince is one of my favorite books in the series and it was with great expectations that I went to see it this in July in theaters. I left somewhat thrilled AND disappointed. Why? For a few reasons, just look at the other reviews here and you will see that about half of them are positive and half negative. They left quite a bit of what I would think is important material from the book which is sad and ruined the experience for many fans and it could have been one closer to the book. It's going to be hard to make the last two HP movies because of this. On the good side the special effects were great and the scenes that were present from the book are great and besides HP 6 being very dark it's also very funny at times and the movie looked amazing. The acting was mostly good I've got no complaints here. It seems each year the movies get darker and this one is really dark, I think it's great and it makes a progression from a movie to another. They clearly didn't follow the book enough like a fan would have wanted but I want to make it clear that didn't prevent me from liking this movie and even buying it. When watching the excellent special features, you may notice how some deleted scenes should have made it to the final cut. Besides all that, there is only so much time in a movie that can't include everything they might have wanted to. I'm not only a fan of the books but a fan of the movies as well and I don't think this one is bad at all, it should have stuck more to the book it's true but the result is still a great movie.",1261699200,,1579,4.11326860841424
3275955,3,B000ZECQ08,"With a unique title slapped across it's glossy face, ""Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"" is the sixth movie in the world of adapting the wildly popular book series into blockbusters. I originally saw it in theaters (in a special, chaotic midnight showing, in fact, which will be the first and last one I attend) and thought I loved it. But when I recently purchased it, upon seeing it released into DVD format, and re-watched it, I fluttered down from my cloud and realized it was, sadly, less than perfect.

Being a movie of beautiful cinematography and amazing computer graphics, it is far from being a fail. Do not listen to the parts of the audience who wailed about it being too different from the book- it's called an ""adaption"", not ""an exact replica of the popular book"" for a reason- it is indeed a good movie. And yet I felt it didn't succeed as well as I expected it to, as much as a HP movie should have.

The movie has some definite slow and dry parts; parts that I admit I fast-forwarded through, since my memories from the silver screening in July aren't frayed yet. There was a bit too much dialog; it ran a bit too long; some sequences were, admittedly, twisted a bit too drastically from the book. Not exactly in a bad way, but in a weird way.

For example, they destroy the Weasley's home in this movie. What?! I was baffled as I saw it collapse before me- well, on the screen before me. And the ending, where instead of Dumbledore freezing Harry motionless, Harry is left capable of stopping Draco and Snape, yet stands below and does quite nothing.

But I decided against complaining, because it is still a winning movie. It has some clever, funny parts- parts that are certainly aimed towards it's chunk of the audience that are teens and young adults- and I love how dark it has gotten. It was filmed grainer, too, and I love the feel it shimmers towards the audience. The actors all did well, I thought, and overall, I found myself shutting off the DVD player with a refreshed sense of easiness, yet not completely satisified.

So as I wrap up my review, I think I can easily say this- not the best Harry Potter movie out there, but a far cry from the worst. A very good one to buy, but perhaps not golden enough to slip the brittle words ""classic"" and ""beloved"" over it's cover.",1261699200,,2308,4.446808510638298
3275956,5,B000ZECQ08,"Bearing in mind that the movie is never as good as the book, (and that I have never read any of the HP books anyway) I found this to be the best Harry Potter movie yet!

The special effects are second to none, and the ""how-it-was-made segments  are amazing! The other features were also very interesting, using the main actors to show us around the sets etc.

I can't wait for the final episode next summer, because this movie has enough possible endings to make it potentially tantalizing!

In case anyone is wondering why I have not divulged any of the movie details, it is because I would like everyone to see the movie. Just make sure you watch all the other movies first to understand the characters and the ongoing plot.

Still, as a movie, it's damned boring and more murky than ""dark"". The characters wander around aimlessly until I reached the point where I not only did not know what was going on, but, more than that, I no longer cared. The principle child actors have not aged well. Daniel Radcliffe mumbles incoherently, Rupert Grint consistently looks like he needs a bath and detox. and Emma Watson, though quite a beauty, appears shallow and clueless. It's now very apparent that these three have no real future as adult actors.

I spent most of the movie gritting my teeth over the horrendous miscasting of Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. I can't believe that they couldn't find anyone who was closer to the style and demeanor of the late Richard Harris. Gambon, who was quoted as saying, ""I just play me"" appears incoherent and senile and apparently doesn't know that no one is really interested in watching him play himself. I suspect that Rowling killed Dumbledore off in the books because it was the only way to get rid of Gambon. He's really that bad!

Even my 10 year-old, who should be within the target demographic couldn't sit through this. I recommend renting this if you're dead set on watching this drivel.",1261699200,5,1346,4.747863247863248

As said over and over by the one and two star writers... this movie was really not that great- which is really disappointing since the book was amazing. I totally understand editing and transfer but so much was cut out or cut down that to someone who has chosen to watch the movies and not read the books- the movie can be awfully confusing.

I felt like allot of the main and important characters were sort of cut off. This book really gives you insight into both Snape and Voldermont but the movie failed to do so.

Further more the lighting wasn't the greatest - my partner and I literally had to turn off all the lights in order to see everything that was going on.

As stated by another reviewer was by far the best (in my opinion) film so far created from the book.

Unfortunately being a fan I do want to see the next (two?) films- I just sincerely hope they use the opportunity they created (cutting the book into two films) and pick up the pace on more of what was left out of the half blood prince film.",1261612800,2,1148,4.176470588235294

With that being said, book readers have to realize that there is no way to be 100% true to the books. The movie would be so expensive to do, plus they have to be able to have their ""creative license"" with it. They have to draw people who don't read the books into the theater. I am also one of those haters that get so mad when something was changed completely or not even in the movie, which IMO should have been.

The first movie is still my favorite, the second one I felt was a bit boring, the third was done fairly well considering, the fourth kept me on a ""high"" almost the whole time but was very disappointing with how much they left out (hell-O... I was SO looking forward to the world cup in the beginning, it really set the stage for the rest of the book) I think they slaughtered this one, the fifth wasn't as true as it could have been but it was also one of the most boring books in the series IMO so it was bittersweet, the sixth is probably my second favorite honestly though it too lacked a lot of information that I feel was needed to go into the seventh book.

It didn't make any sense to him.

In watching the film a second time I can understand his confusion. If you haven't read the book, there are too many gaps.  This book is unique in that Harry is not involved in a single clear-cut mission against Voldermort and his followers.  Instead, the book details a whole host of events that seem intended to tie up loose ends and set the stage for the final one.  In compressing 652 pages into 153 minutes, the movie isn't able to establish a tie between these various situations and events as well as the book: In fact it hardly tries.  It feels more like a 153 minute ""Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"" book teaser... a series of unrelated snippets designed to lure you into buying and reading it.

3275973,4,B000ZECQ08,"So how is Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince? I thought it was great and worth the delay. It has a few problems, but its good points outweigh its bad ones by far.

The movie vesion of Half-Blood Prince is easily the one of the darkest Potter films (apparently the rating doesn't matter very much) but it is also one of the most humorous. The film features performances from Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson that are all excellent with other great performances by Michael Gambon and Jim Broadbent, as well. The film, particularly the memory scenes, make marvelous use of dark greens and gray colors with plenty of special effects to recreate the grim atmosphere of the book. Frank Dillane is perfect in his performance as the teenage Voldemort during some of the flashbacks, creating a reserved scariness while maintaining the squeaky-clean appearance of Tom Riddle. Yet the movie balances the creepy parts with the funny scenes, mainly involving the relationship between Ron and Lavender Brown. Director David Yates improves his skills since the last film with a more involving and entertaining one here.

What confused me was the choice of what was taken out and what was added to the film. As with all book-based films, some edits were necessary to allow the movie to have a smooth run time (which never feels too long), while others make very little sense at all. Most of the memory scenes were completely removed, leaving only the ""essentials"". I wonder how they will explain a Horcrux such as Hufflepuff's Cup without the part included in book 6 that reveals its significance. I could not figure out why the fight scene at The Burrow was added, but I didn't mind. Perhaps to achieve a run time of about 2 1/2  hours, the film feels as though it were heavily edited in some scenes.

While not completely flawless, the filmmakers achieved what they set out to do very well with the sixth installment in the Harry Potter series. Check it out, this movie is definitely worthwhile!",1261180800,,1981,4.80058651026393

For those people who want to diss the movie for not following the book exactly, lighten up. I doubt you would be able to do any better. This movie was already long. With any more added scences the movie could become TOO long, and people need to understnad that its incredibly unrealistic to think movie producers will follow every step and chapter in the book. If viewers would just watch the movie without all those prejuduces they might actually see what great movies they are and be able to enjoy them!

O.K., this movie was very well produced. It made me laugh, cry, and captivated me throughout. The actors truly shone in this movie!! I would recommend that viewers watch the preceding movies first, to truly capture the whole gist of the plot. So, for those people who left not-so-good comments..... If these movies were meant to be watched out of order the Half blood prince wouldnt be labeled the sixth movie!! Is it really that big of a deal to watch them in chronological order?!

These movies have such an intricate plot and dynamic theme that they stand out among thousands. I highly suggest viewers watch this movie and read the books if you haven't already!!!! =)",1261180800,3,1264,4.638392857142857

Some of the best Tom Riddle's best memories are left out of this one.  Harry's inheritance of Sirius Black's home and house elf, an important part of understanding Regulis Black, is also left out.  Voldemort's own maternal and paternal histories, as well of what he thought of his mother has been left out.  There are so many things left out of this movie that made J.K. Rowling's book so good that I think as fans, we should demand a redo!!!
The one bright spot in this movie, however, is Alan Rickman (Snape).  In his face you could see his concern for all of the students involved in the inner circles of Voldemort and Dumbledore.",1261094400,,806,4.382550335570469

A bluray disk...the end. Where is my DVD version? Where is my digital copy access code? Why is Amazon stealing my money and thinks it is ok? Well, it's not. In my ""Orders"" page, it says the Bluray combo is what I purchased...now this page has changed to what I received -- a Bluray disk. I don't care about BD Live options. I want a DVD to watch in my laptop. According to other review the digital copy only works on media players I do not own, so I'm not too upset over that. I just want what I clearly ordered. Is that too much to ask? That's why I purchase directly from Amazon. I want to avoid receiving wrong products, not purposefully get a random movie.

I have a feeling that because this was available for pre-order for a few weeks, Amazon ran out and just shipped this version.

I still want a DVD version as I paid for one!

UPDATE 12/19/09: I received an email from Amazon that stated some customers purchased the Bluray/DVD combo w/ digital copy during a promotional stage and it was never removed from the website. Since I was one of those customers, they are giving me a promo code to buy the DVD for free and get the Amazon digital copy (you can watch it on your computer w/o an internet connection if you download the Amazon Unbox player, which I did -- we'll see how good it is once the movie finishes) so in a sense, I'm getting what I paid for. I'm glad Amazon rectified the situation within 3 days. That was very nice. Thank you!

UPDATE 01/02/10: I watched the movie. It was alright. Like others have said, the previous movies were better. It was pretty slow for the majority of the film. You could probably just watch the first 20 minutes and then the last 45 and not miss much. I hope the finally is better.

3275979,4,B000ZECQ08,"As the Harry Potter series continued, each story got bigger and bigger. Honestly the first book was a 'juvenile' book, the last book was, well, anything but a juvenile. J.K. Rowling did an wonderful job of 'maturing' the focus and tone of the books as Harry Potter grew up. That is why the series works so well, in my opinion.
But the movies struggled with the 'bigness' of the books all along. The old 'what to leave in, what to leave out' conundrum was evident from the first movie. By 'Goblet', there were solid 'chunks' of the books that were dropped or just touched on - if you had not read the books, it was hard to really follow who and what etc and especially why things were moving the way they were.
The scope of the books was literally staggering, that grandness is not so evident in the movies. Starting with 'Goblet', I would argue that each movie probably could have been much longer or better two movies rather easily - which in fact the approach they are taking with 'Hallows'.
So to review 'Prince', the movie is ok in my opinion - just hard to follow plot-wise especially if you are a big fan of the book. But I think there was just too much left out - really the plot is there, mostly, but no where near as deep and rich as the book. I would like to imagine that there is a 'director's cut' out there somewhere - maybe with 30 or 60 minutes more screen time - which fully displays the true 'magic' of the story itself.
Again, I do not want to be too negative here, this is an epic story and would be a toughie to film, I guess, like LOTR, you have to credit the films for being made in the first place. BY all means, just read the books and then see the films.",1261094400,,1679,4.201238390092879

So I picked it up and from the left side, it looks like Harry and Dumbledore. I know it's trivial but its the little things I try to smile about.

If you've read the book you probably spent a good majority of the movie going ""where did that scene go?"" and yes there is a lot missing. The Half-Blood prince was simply too dense of a book to fit into a 2 hour movie. A lot of the book is building up to what happens and unfolds in the final book, I would have rather seen this film in two parts then leave out scenes (or add scenes like they did). I think for this movie to be fully enjoyed and understood, you would definitely need to read the book.

Spoilers Ahead (actually if you read the book these aren't spoilers, just things you might have noticed are missing): These are just some of the more important scenes that are left out: The final Hogwarts battle, Dumbledore's funeral, Sirius' property being stolen, Harry and Ginny's relationship and its ending, where are the older Weasley boys?. There are other parts that are gone, other reviewers have already touched on them.

I did give this movie four stars because I feel it did deserve it. One star because its a Harry Potter film, I enjoy the series. Another star for the chemistry between everyone.  It was great, especially now since they are coming of age, hormones are running wild and love is blossoming, its a normal part of growing up. It also provided a great balance to the darkness that overtook the movie. Another star for the emotional conflict of Malfoy, it was excellent. He was able to get more screen time and we see his internal battle. And the last star for, the acting. I think everyone did a great job portraying the emotion or lack there of in the film. Except the ending, I felt more emotional reading the book than what came across on the screen.  After a slight let down of this movie, now the wait begins for Nov 2010 for part 1 of the Deathly Hallows (or maybe not since it's the same director).",1261008000,14,2113,4.352791878172589

No such problem with any other DVDs).  It's much too dark and required setting TV brightness and backlight to maximum values; which tends to be a bit washed-out. If you don't, many parts of the movie are black.  Several other sections are actually grainy in HD! Sound is mediocre.  Theatrical release quality was obviously much compromised (maybe the Blu-ray is better?).

The movie attempts to combine multiple plot threads and coming-of-age for the teenagers.  A very poor attempt that comes off with many loose fragments and distractions.  Unlike the other movies in the series, plot coherency is all but lost. Harry Potter fans may be able to put things together from the book, but others will find this movie impossible to follow.  The movie also assumes you've seen the previous movies so you know the characters and will likely buy the next so this one will actually finish.

THe idea that we weren't aware that there was a deep friendship between the trio is laughable.  The HBP is devoted to the discovery that Tom has used items to split his soul and that the mission is to destroy them.  The book has detailed many trips into past memories to learn about Tom's progression to evil and insights into how he got there.  I was shocked and disappointed to watch this be turned into a story that focuses on the obvious and leaves out so many details that made this book fantastic and creates the hurry and anxiety of the 7th book/movie.  This could have been a fantastic movie but I believe that so many of the good reviewers are just in love with the story enough that it hurts them to rate the movie poorly, I know that my instinct tells me that I should give it 2 stars but I can't bring myself to do it.

3275986,4,B000ZECQ08,"""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" was by far the weakest of J.K. Rowling's books, so I didn't have high expectations for the movie. I only hoped that the filmmakers would take this opportunity to correct some of the book's problems with editing and character writing. I wasn't disappointed. Like the book, this film seems more of a segway between Year 5 and Year 7 than an independent adventure. But Harry Potter is not as passive as in the novel, where he seemed to be drained of personality. The students' social lives don't strain credibility, and the scenario is not drowned in filler. There is filler -make no mistake. The film could easily be cut by 40 minutes. But the superfluous scenes give the audience more time to enjoy the wacky wizarding world and to see some familiar characters, so people will probably not complain too much about the length.

As Year 6 at Hogwarts begins, menace is in the air. Wizards and muggles alike are terrorized by Voldemort's Death-Eaters. People are disappearing. Hogwarts has taken security measures to protect the students. Headmaster Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) has convinced Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent) to come out of retirement to teach Potions -or rather he has allowed Harry Potter's (Daniel Radcliffe) presence at the school to influence Slughorn, who prides himself on having taught all the most famous wizards and their children. But Dumbledore wants something more from Slughorn, a secret that he believes essential to defeating the Dark Lord. Young Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), meanwhile, sneaks around Hogwarts in a constant state of anxiety on account of a mysterious mission he has been entrusted to carry out for the Dark Lord.

Not a lot goes on in the ""Half-Blood Prince"". It's primarily a set-up for the finale in Year 7. The pace is slower than usual, but the film manages more suspense than the book. Director David Yates has made it very snowy at Hogwarts for a white-out effect. The palette is appropriately drab as the world teeters on chaos. The book's single strength was the scenes of Voldemort/Tom Riddle's origins and youth. Unfortunately, those receive spare treatment in the film. That's too bad, because we need to know more about Voldemort in order for him to become a full-fledged character before the final showdown. A script for the ""Half-Blood Prince"" is tricky, as the book has multiple plot threads that lead nowhere (for the moment). But Voldemort's past could have been integrated without completely losing cohesion. That's the one major flaw in a film that otherwise is an improvement over the book.",1261008000,,2593,5.0

Absolutely no action whatosever.  The Quidish section lasts about 4 minutes and there may be about 15 minutes of action in the title.

I also understand that movies have time constraints and studios don't want movies to be too long because that cuts down on the number of times the movie can be shown thus cutting into profits.  I get it.

*****MILD SPOILERS BE AHEAD******
I would have rather seen the memory of Tom Riddle trying to get on as the Defense against the Dark Arts teacher but being turned away which is the reason the post is now cursed than the Bridge Collapse scene.  Or Maybe the Dursleys at the beginning where Harry inherits Grimauld Place and Kreacher all at once instead of Harry chatting up a waitress at a train station.  Or some explanation as to the fact that the remaining Horcruxes would be tied to the Hogwarts founders because of how important Hogwarts was to Voldemort or maybe Dumbledore's funeral instead of the attack on the burrough.  And Harry not being petrified on the astronomy tower is just unforgiveable.  Lots of stuff that come part 7 isn't going to make a whole lot of sense if it is just dropped in out of nowhere.
*****NO MORE SPOILERS*****

All that being said the movie is still really good and very well made It just seems like they made it because they felt like they had to instead of truly wanting to bridge the gap to the final chapter in the saga.  3+ stars for the actual movie.

Where it gets the extra star is for the amazing bonus features that I haven't even gotten the opportunity to scratch the surface of yet.  The brief but excellent featurette on the Deathly Hallows is outstanding.  The deleted scenes are okay.  A couple that could and probably SHOULD have been left in the final film.  The featurette on the Wizarding World opening up at Universal Orlando next year has me completely geeked to go.  They are outstanding.

So to sum it up.  If you are a Harry Potter fan and enjoyed the movie even a little bit definately pick this up if for nothing else than the extra bonus features.  If you hated the movie but are still a fan see if you can borrow a copy to watch the bonus stuff.  It's worth every minute spent.",1260835200,2,2311,4.485645933014354

3276000,1,B000ZECQ08,"What is it about Harry Potter movies that make them so unmemorable?  Obviously it can't be the source material.  The beloved series by J.K. Rowling is pure magic, no pun intended.  Still, as a fan of the books, I watch each film, excited each time around to see the story of Harry Potter unfold on the big screen.  I'm not sure what I'm expecting from these films.  I mean, they are adaptions of a book.  In my opinion, books are always better than their movie counterparts.  The Lord of the Rings trilogy might be the only exception in my mind, but that's another story.

What has frustrated me about the movies are the missed opportunities, and I'm not even talking about scenes from the books that didn't make the films.  Here's an example:

In Order of the Phoenix, the climactic battle at the end of the film between the Death Eaters and The Order culminates in the timely arrival of Dumbledore.  In the book, this is nothing short of a ""Gandalf On A White Horse"" moment.  He arrives as the battle seems lost, and kicks some serious tail. In the film, he walks out of a fireplace like he just woke up from a nap.

In this latest film, The Half-blood Prince, we see more of the same.  Once again, a battle sequence at the end of the book finds all hell breaking loose at Hogwarts, after Dumbledore... well... You know.  Instead the Death Eaters just casually walk out of the school, as if it were a passing period.  What makes this an even greater insult is that the filmmakers decide to add a scene that wasn't in the book, and frankly, serves NO PURPOSE.  The ""Attack On The Burrow"", as it has come to be known, makes no sense.  It accomplishes nothing.  It doesn't advance the plot.

The filmmakers have one more chance to get it right with the Deathly Hallows.

Acting was stilted.  Too many story changes.  No ""magic"" at all felt during the movie. I know it should be dark because of the story line, but the director and whoever wrote the screenplay totally ruined it for me.

At the end of the book, when Severus yells at Harry... ""don't call me coward!""  That is a climactic moment and it was completely left out of the movie!
The whole backstory of Voldemorts mother and childhood  are left out.

If it was too much movie for one book, then pick up the pace.  It totally dragged. I will not watch it again.

If this same director is doing the next two movies, I won't bother seeing them.  I would give the movie ZERO stars if I could.",1260748800,71,784,4.27891156462585

I also like the bonus features of this BD, it's so much better than those of other titles. But I think I'm not satisfied with the Image Quality of this BD: the image seems a bit fuzzy and foggy, it's just not as clear as other BD titles (for example, Startrek, G.I.Joe...), the average bit rate of Paramount 09 BD is over 30MB/sec, but this Harry Potter BD is only about 20MB/Sec (the Dark Knight is about the same bit rate, but the Image Quality is still much better), I really love this film, so that's why I'm expecting more from Warner Brothers. My conspiracy theory is that they did this intentionally, so that fans would be forced to buy their 2nd release (such like ""ultimate version""...) for a better image quality... sorry, might be a bit drama queen here, but I'm really not satisfied with the image quality.",1260662400,2,949,4.3977272727272725

There was no battle at the school leading up to Dumbledore being confronted by Malfoy. Overall, I was disappointed. This movie is the most faithless adaptation of all the six movies released so far.

3276009,4,B000ZECQ08,"I had difficulties with the Bluray disk.  Ultimately I had to download a firmware upgrade (version 2.1) for my early generation Samsung P-1400 player.  Since my player is not connected to the internet, the download was made to a CD and then to the player.  I had trouble with the unzip function and then with transferring the upgrade file to the CD.  The first two attempts produced a CD unrecognizable by the player.  Through trial and error I produced a CD that worked with the player. The actual upgrade took place smoothly with instructions on the TV screen.  The final result allowed me to play the movie but the limitations of the P-1400 could not give me access to all the features of the three disks in the Bluray edition.  Also the effect of dark shading and other artistic aspects of the film diminished the full effect of the 1080p screen image.  I recommend that buyers of the Bluray version who have older players take the time to download the latest firmware updates from their player's manufacturer and install them before taking an hour or so trying to make the Bluray work or to returning them to Amazon.

The negative and positive reviews here of The Half Blood Prince are generally valid depending on what the reviewer expected.  The film's limitations were dependent upon the complexity of the book and the time limitations for a feature film.  Much of The Half Blood Prince is dependent upon the viewers' knowledge of the books and previous Potter movies.  As such,  The Half Blood Prince does not do well as a stand alone feature film.  I am sure time limitations also caused numerous scene deletions and compromises with the story line.  Nonetheless, this movie provides a thoroughly enjoyable next installment in the Potter series.  All of the actors provided excellent performances.  Humor and comic relief were provided by the coming of age mishaps of Potter and crew in an otherwise moody and somber story.  I think the directors could have emphasized suspense more as opposed to fear and the dark mood.  All this being said, go ahead buy and enjoy the Bluray edition of Harry Potter And The Half Blood Prince.",1260662400,,2137,4.758152173913044
3276010,4,B000ZECQ08,"I've reserved my review of Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince until now for several reasons.  I learned my lesson after first hating the Prisoner of Azkaban and then realizing it was the best of the Potter movie series after seeing it the second time. After three viewings of HFP, I still have some major issues with the altering of the plot but have discovered that it isn't as bad as I first thought when coming out of the movie theater.

Like most Potter fans who have read all the books, I sorely miss the subplots involving Fleur, Bill and Charlie, Tonks and Lupin.  I hate that Tonks wasn't the one to rescue Harry from the train.  I balked at the horrible destruction of the burrows.  I really wanted to see more Alan Rickman--you can never get enough of Alan Rickman.  I wished for more of Maggie Smith, but after realizing her battle with cancer during the filming, I give her props for her courage in going ahead.  Ms. Smith is a giant among actresses with a wonderful list of great films to her credit, but she will always be the one and only Professor McGonagall in my mind and no replacement would be possible.

My greatest beef was the anticlimactic ending--in the book, the fight going on with the death eaters and the Army of Dumbledore, along with death of Dumbledore was much more exciting and emotionally moving.  I sorely missed the grandeur of Dumbledore's funeral--which truly illustrated Dumbledore's greatness and how much he was loved by all creatures.  This was the biggest problem of all, along with the poor musical score (a sad rehashing of the last movie bits along with some forgettable fillers).  Please, oh please, pay John Williams anything he wants--beg him if you have to--to write the score for final two movies!

However, after my third time viewing the movie, I have to admit that the acting was better than ever, the dialogue was great, the chemistry between the actors has matured and solidified delightfully, the actor for Professor Slughorn was superior even to the character in the book, and Michael Gambon has finally filled the great shoes of Richard Harris.  The actors were the best part of the movie--perfect casting!

I give this movie three out of four stars after giving it a real chance and trying to overcome my personal objections to the huge changes from the book (which was simply amazing).  I'm sure in time many Potter fans who were disappointed with this chapter in the series will forgive these mistakes and accept it as it is--a valuable part of the Harry Potter series.",1260662400,2,2536,4.693002257336343

if someome didn't read the books and just saw the movies, he/she probably wouldn't have a problen with the film.  but if someone, like me, who did read the books, would.

it was lacking, done in a rush manner.  like the director took the book or script or whatnot, said, cut this, cut, cut with no thought about it. all done, I imagine, to save time and money which is sad and well stupid.  the movie should have been longer or done into two parts.  if it was done longer, granted, people would have complained about sitting on their butts for a 2 1/2 to 3 hour long movie but they would have done it.

the characters from Harry to hagrid were flat--they all seemed to have the look of boredom (or dissapointment) on their faces.  it was like, they came, mumbled their lines and went.  the only thing that was consistent was that it was dark, as it was in the book.

3276015,2,B000ZECQ08,"This movie is painful to watch. There are many more flaws than even Geoff (another reviewer) points out in his review. I get irritated just by watching it. I thought the first movie was brilliant in every way. The second was very good. Beginning with Azkaban, the movies have gone downhill. I think Michael Gambon, while a fine actor, is horribly miscast as Dumbledore. Where's his twinkling eyes? Where's his mouth twiching when he's amused and trying not to show it? Albus Dumbledore, as we know him in the books, has an almost child-like sense of humor and wonder. Gambon lacks these qualities entirely. The dialogue is terrible. There's almost zero continuity in the film. I agree with Geoff . . this movie is only very loosely based on the book. I bought the DVD because I'm a Harry Potter fanatic and must have all the movies, but I am deeply disappointed.",1260576000,3,862,4.677631578947368
3276016,2,B000ZECQ08,"My son and I just re-watched Harry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince.  We had seen it in the theater over the summer and I had forgotten just how disappointing this movie was.  There were many, many important details that were left out from the book and an entirely new scene was inserted that made absolutely no sense.  This movie should've been split into two like Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows will be.  Since we are supposed to be getting clues as to Voldemort's past, the first and most important clue was left out of the movie!  The scene that is missing is how Tom Riddle Sr. met Voldemort's mother and how Voldemort ended up in the orphanage in the first place, and also how Voldemort came to be in the possession of the first horcrux.

The scene that really outraged me was the Christmas scene at the Weasley House.  If the writers of the script had been paying attention to ""A History of Hogwarts"" they would have known that the Weasley's house could not be destroyed like that because it is protected with charms just like Hogwarts is.  In addition, since the characters use the Weasley's house as a safe haven in both book 6 and 7, this scene is utterly ridiculous.  There is, however, a nice moment between Dumbledore and Harry in which Dumbledore realizes that Harry is actually the 8th Horcrux.

I also disliked how the director leached the color out of nearly every scene.  The Harry Potter movies have always been a visual feast, rich with color and detail, but as the story has grown darker, so have the movies - literally.  I miss the splendid colors of the first four movies.

I bought this movie in Blue Ray to complete our set, but it will probably be the Harry Potter movie I will be the least likely to re-watch.",1260576000,2,1742,4.509554140127388

3276018,3,B000ZECQ08,"I have to say I wasn't disappointed, but then I wasn't expecting much - and it met my expectations.  For those who have read the book it may fall a little flat.  In the Order of the Phoenix there are 2 scenes that epitomize what I am looking for in a movie and what the Half blood prince actually delivers.  In OotP the scene where Sirius dies was devastating, but then it would be very difficult to mess that up.  It is the emotion I am looking for not the exact words or scenes.  Instead this movie compares to the book as the OotP scene at the end where Harry was in Dumbledores office.  In the book it seemed to be the culmination of all the anger Harry had experienced and built up to.  Instead it was if they were reading the words off a page, hey maybe they were.  All the emotion had been stripped from the scene.  Comparably much of the emotion in the HPB have been changed or stripped when transfered to the movie.  I believe this has more to do the with the director than the actors.

Be it a wizard or muggle Voldemort has his sights set one finally completing his mission, but he must eliminate the chosen one. Harry Potter, is about to enter his sixth year at Hogwarts. This time, besides being closely watched over by the watchful and caring Albus Dumbledore Harry must face a new challenge, being a normal teenaged boy with his thoughts fixated on girls. Friendships and dating is swimming all throughout the corridors at Hogwarts and it's much more complicated than any Quidditch match. Still, Harry must stay focused because he can sense that there is a plot afoot to penetrate the walls of Hogwarts and turn the haven of wizarding youth into a spawning ground for Death Eaters. The questions that need to be answered are who is plotting it, whom are they after and who is working with them on the inside. There are many secrets revealed about Voldemorts past in this chapter, but most importantly this is the point in time when Harry Potter finally makes the choice on what he must do to finally take down his nemesis.

There were many mixed reviews about this film, but as a fan who read this book when it was first released this was my favorite installment (Meaning it surpases 'Chamber of Secrets'). What grabbed me the most was this book made things a little lighter after two extremely dark novels. It was a much more human story showing that while there is a classic story of good versus evil in an imaginative world these young witches and wizards are still just ordinary teenagers with ordinary problems. Bringing David Yates back to direct this film was the best choice because in 'Order Of The Phoenix' he brought realism to the characters and deep development within themselves and with one another. Tackling love and heartbreak is a very hard thing to do in a Sci-Fi fantasy film, but Yates nailed it. The story was also very funny as the book was. The characters show fears in the areas on popularity or just manning up to tell a girl how he felt. Tom Felton who has played Draco was finally given a chance to show his acting potential. While there was minimal dialogue until the very end his body language showed true emotional that really worked the crowd. The fact that a boy who has always boasted about being a proud dark wizard can shed tears when he faces his true self was made so believable by Felton. I sure hope that once these films have concluded he is given a chance for more work and many stellar performances.

 If you agree with this review then like me this will be a Harry Potter film you will enjoy. We now look forward to the final chapter going Hoarcrux on us to bring us the entire final book page by page. It looks as though they want to do the finale correctly so expect nothing less than a PG-13 rating.",1260576000,2,2913,4.523719165085389

Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince is a highly entertaining, fantasy adventure that also provides for some very witty humor.
Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Alan Rickman, and the rest of this EXTRAORDINARY cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt one that can be watched over and over again.
The concept, the plot, the setting, the dialogues, the special effects, and the music, are all EXCELLENT!  Though slower than its predecessors action-wise, Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince will still provide a great deal of entertainment.  In addition, it is one of those movies that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over.

Look at all the past HP movies, always a good blend of story with action. This movie was like a melodrama with minimal action. For 2 and1/2 hours that you expect some long exciting wizardry action you get a lot of dialog. It felt like there were not many action scenes. The only real exciting scenes were at the beginning where the villains known as the Dark Lords are flying around wrecking havoc and the ending with a death of a major character.
There wasn't even some giant monster or beast or any giants to fight...just some dead people coming out of the water entrapping Harry Potter and Dumbledorff.  It was decent, on - re-review, but it just lacked that spark this time around. I felt this lacked a lot of action that made the first ones great.. What gives ?
The only thing I can think of that this is the calm before the storm as obviously this set up the next 2 films which I hope will be full of action suspense, and other fantasy elements that make these films so good.
The story is to uncover the secrets of the Half Blood Prince, who is he, and to find the potion that uncovers the secrets of the prince. Lots of scenes of Harry's facial expressions. For a movie of this length there just was not enough scenes of action. Collectors will get the 2 disc version.",1260576000,,1437,4.361940298507463

Now, to get on to the movie. As I said before, I loved all of the books, and have loved all of the movies except for #3 (see above). David Yates does a good job handling the wealth of information from the book, although they did take a very liberal license in omitting certain parts of the book (such as Dumbledore's funeral), or flat out changing some parts of the book (such as Luna finding a paralyzed Potter on the train, instead of Tonks). Despite these minor annoyances, the acting is really good from all the characters (especially Alan Rickman in his brilliant interpretation of Snape).

Overall, the movie was very well done. I'm really glad that David Yates has stuck with the franchise, as each movie has been better.

If you are a Potter fan, you will get this movie. If you are on the fence and want a good fantasy movie to watch, then I would recommend getting this as well.",1260576000,3,1216,4.5181818181818185

My biggest beefs with this film... They never explained why Snape is the HBP, those extra scenes, expecially the waitress chick (??!!), and they never told us what the other suspected Horcruxes were! (ie the memories Harry needs in order to find them in Deathly Hallows!) Are they planning to cram all that down our throat in the first 10 min of DH so that we have some clue? ARRGGHHH!
I don't expect it to follow the book completely, but really now, how about getting the important points across before adding all the extra drivel. If they could make HP3 and its complicated time travel plot make sense on film surely they could have made this one better!

3276026,5,B000ZECQ08,"There are some spoilers in this review, so if you haven't watched the movie yet, I recommend that you don't read.

I've read quite a few of these other reviews, good and bad, and I agree with some of both. I think that YES they did leave a little too much IMPORTANT info out of this movie, while I also think they did a good job of getting more of the book into this one. There were VITAL scenes that they left out though, In the scene where Snape kills Dumbledore, he did make impossible for Harry to help him in the book, and I think that should have been kept in the movie. If they HAD to take it out, which I seriously doubt, why did they have to make it look like Harry didn't want to help? That made me mad. Also, one other part of the book that I considered VITAL to the movie was the funeral at the end. This was the most beautiful part of the entire book and it was also a little confirming. I say this because when I read the book, a little part of me kept thinking, ""Maybe Dumbledore's not dead"" and the funeral kinda gave me confirmation, and a beautiful closure.

This movie was rated 5 stars by me because I feel like it is a breath of fresh air compared to the last movie, which was my favorite book, and Phoenix was absolutely butchered. This one however kinda sets the pace a little better in preparing viewers for the last of the series and all the great things to come.

This movie really gives off that sense of urgency that you feel when reading the book when you consider how important it is for Harry to learn all that he can about Valdemort because he IS the ONLY one who can kill him. I just wish that they would have reminded you a little more in this movie WHY he needs to be killed.

But like I said, I did enjoy this one much more than the last, so I have to give it kudos. I read the book twice, and there were details in the movie that I had forgotten were in the book until I saw them on screen.

Five stars from me. Thanks.",1260489600,3,1956,4.043927648578811

Instead, what I lament is the complete disregard for the story line altogether.
One of the many things that I admire about Rowling's writing is her ability to increase the level of tension and suspense throughout the book. This development of tension was blatantly missing from the movie. In the book the tension begins with the heightened security throughout the wizarding world, no student is left to wander alone and Harry is watched like a hawk. The presence of the Order of the Phoenix was vital to the literary version; however it is barely evident in the movie. In the movie Harry is allowed to wander at will and later he wanders with Ron and Hermione, no member of the Order hovering nearby for their protection.
Of course, the biggest disappointment, as others have mentioned, is the battle between Dumbledore's Army and the Deatheaters. In the book it was the crisis to which all actions were leading. In the movie, this event never occurs. Dumbledore's death wasn't even provided the emphasis it deserved and to rub it in, his funeral never transpires.
Perhaps the storyline was not paramount for the director of the movie, because those seemingly unimportant scenes that add depth and complexity to any story were also excluded. For example, the scenes that take place at The Burrow over Christmas, the interactions between the characters, would have added richness to the film that it lacked. What we get instead is the ninety-second version of the Christmas gathering, with none of the bickering or banter that occurs within families, like Fleur's imitation of Molly's favorite singer, or Ginny's mocking of Fleur behind her back. We really could have used those moments of levity.  I, of course, don't look forward to the wedding in the next film, as apparently Fleur and Bill are nonexistent. This is probably for the best as The Burrow was blown up in this film, an addition of which I can't see any value as it certainly didn't advance plot.
It was bad enough that the cast of characters that we've grown so fond of over the years are noticeably absent (most members of D.A. for starters); the ones we do see get very little screen time. The halls of Hogwarts are now filled with nameless crowd-fillers rather than characters we remember from previous films.  I also deplore that the actors and actresses that have helped to make these HP films so classically British are rarely seen in this film. Dame Maggie Smith and Robbie Coltrane were barely visible. We got to see Alan Rickman, but not enough, and Mark Williams and Julie Walters were not given sufficient time on screen. I was particularly horrified to see the scene when Ron was in the hospital wing after the accidental poisoning. In that scene there are several of Britain's finest living actors and actresses standing around for little apparent reason except to be upstaged, quite literally, by Jessie Cave playing the role of Lavender Brown. What a waste of great talent.
I could go on to make comments about the monochromatic and unchanging lighting to the ""Les Mis&eacute;rables"" look-alike stage settings, perhaps even making a few comments about the ""phoned-in"" performances by much of the cast, but I'll leave it here. Suffice it to say that I can't recommend this film if you're expecting to see a favorite book to come to life on the screen. If you like the Harry Potter series, don't buy the DVD. Save your money; go out and buy a good hard copy of the book and enjoy it as it was meant to be enjoyed; read it.",1260403200,9,3958,4.886904761904762

I understand cutting out things like the funeral.  This series is really going into a depressing area, and it really doesn't come out of it until the very end.  I think that JKR took a poor path when she darkened the story further than she really needed to.  But this movies bent even further in that direction with pretty much the entire production soaked in sepia toned depression, and the morose tone overshadowing the few remaining exciting parts.
I would not reccommend that anyone buy this movie.  Staring at a wall is less depressing.",1260403200,16,750,4.601503759398496

To be fair to the movie producers, this novel is so rich in crucial info from the multiple story lines, it would be impossible to tell them all within the necessary time frame of a single motion picture... which makes it all the more incomprehensible that they would choose to ADD scenes not in the novel! Stupid decision! To leave out the change over of ministers... the relevance of Fenrir Greyback... the attack on Bill (Ron's older brother)... the act of Dumbledore immobilizing Harry, just prior to the end... no they just have Harry skulking underneath like a coward! I don't care that they had Albus tell Harry to do it. No HERO, and that is what Harry is, would just skulk below! These, all these events and more, are simply left out? And why have Greyback in there at all? Nowhere did they even mention his being a werewolf!!! and that he was the reason Remus was turned!!! --- This film is problematic in so many ways but to me, the biggest complaint I have is the almost total lack of COLOUR in the film! This dreadful journey is so depressing with the greys and dingy yellows and off whites and hazy browns... enough already!

3276034,5,B000ZECQ08,"Unlike some other movies that are based on books, the Harry Potter franchise has done a superb job of adapting to film while keeping to the original storyline, especially given the thickness of the books as the series progresses.  I currently own the Blu-ray boxed set of films 1-5 (and am watching Goblet of Fire as I write this), and absolutely LOVE it.  I have not yet watched my new blu-ray copy of the Half-blood Prince yet (will do so as soon as I finish the Order of the Phoenix), but I did watch a low quality version of it several months ago.  I cannot WAIT to finally view it in high quality HD, and I had no idea that the slipcover would be lenticular, which I absolutely LOVE!  That, along with the BEST price of a new release blu-ray that I have EVER seen ($14.99), especially for a film as popular as this one, as well as the much-anticipated exclusive footage from the Deathly Hallows (which is actually rumored to be a two-parter), not to mention all the other awesome special features, is the reason I give this product a 5-star rating!",1260403200,3,1053,4.4404145077720205
3276035,5,B000ZECQ08,"I've given this product 5 stars for the entire package, and not the movie only.  As a movie, ""Half-Blood Prince"", is the best in the series since ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" and ""Goblet of Fire"".  Granted for the fans who have read the books as well, there are plenty of glaring omissions that take away from the story.  It's safe to say there will be a lot of making up to do in the ""Deathly Hallows"" films.

Still it is a great movie.  David Yates has done an excellent job of directing.  It is much better than his first installment in the series ""Order of ther Phoenix.""  My only quip with him as a director, is that he seems to shy away from the action scenes and go all out on the emotion and feeling.  Emotion is a key element of the series, but so is the action and thrill sequences.

The strongest element of Yates' direction is the acting.  ""Order of the Phoenix"" and ""Half-Blood Prince"" have arguably the best acting in the series, and it is a joy to watch in this film.

My final score for the movie itself is 4 out of 5 stars.

Now on to why the package gets 5 stars.  First of all it is a 3 disc package.  The Blu-Ray movie, the Blu-Ray Special Features disc, and the DVD movie.  So it has very high accesibility.  If you don't have a Blu-Ray at the current moment, you can still watch it on your DVD player while waiting to upgrade.  The Special Features disc, like with most of the Harry Potter DVDs, is PHENOMENAL!  The HP series always seems to hit grandslams with their special features.  One of the features included is a 2 minute preview of the ""Deathly Hallows.""

Finally there is an option for a Digital Copy.  With all of this, it makes ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" one of the best Blu-Ray/DVD packages around.",1260403200,7,1740,4.308641975308642

I didn't read any of the books prior to seeing this film, so I initially thought it was pretty good and set the scene for the next one. After seeing it, I was so curious to find out what was going to happen, I went back and read all the books. Once I read them (they were EXCELLENT by the way) I started to understand what others were talking about. There were so many things left out that I would think it will be quite difficult to find a way to write them in the way the book was written.

There's not much here to justify that claim and quite a lot that simply does not belong.

3276040,2,B000ZECQ08,"Luckily, most HP fans read the books, because you would be mislead and lost here trying to figure out the story, present--and most importantly, for the future of the series.

Some changes were just stupid, not paralyzing Harry during the climatic scene, for example.  Some make a certain kind of sense, not having the Hogwarts battle in this movie, saving it for the great finale in the last book (movie) and perhaps that is why they added the Burrows fight.  I didn't really mind the Burrows fight for that reason, since it was consistent with the tone of the book, but allowed the BIG Hogwart's fight that is coming to (perhaps) have more of an impact.

Others have detailed the other horrid omissions, so I won't recap them all here.  One that REALLY bugged me was not having the Snape, ""DON'T CALL ME A COWARD!"" Harry scene.

They should have also explained the constant dreary foggy look of the movie, at least a throw away comment from a muggle, or about muggles not understanding the weather.  Hogwarts has always been able to control it's internal weather though, and a few sharp, clearly photographed, colorful scenes would have been a RELIEF to see once or twice during this visually dull movie.

WAY too much Quiddich!  It's never worth sacrificing story for that crap--and this director did.

Pretty disappointing, but I am FURIOUS that those with DVD players don't get to see the extras!  THAT is marketing at it's worst, and it is infuriating.",1260316800,7,1457,4.742063492063492
3276041,1,B000ZECQ08,"Not only does it bare little resemblance to the main parts of the book, but the director's use of gray and blue filters, meant to covey, I guess, drama and foreboding, just takes away from the watching of this ""thing.""

By the time I was ten minutes into the movie I was so distracted by the off-colors, kind of like a very bad ""colorized"" black and white movie, that the plot points escaped me. I really had to concentrate on the story, sometimes looking at the floor so that the muddy picture wouldn't distract me, but finally gave up after an hour.

Maybe it redeemed itself in the last hour and a half, but I doubt it.

I had to add that my wife, who dearly loves the Harry Potter books, and owns both the VHS and DVD copies of the first three films, can't stand watching this either. She now plays it only when she is in bed, back turned towards the TV as she is falling asleep.

Update...02/16/2012

I pre-ordered the complete Harry Potter set on Blu-ray discs (11 discs and the entire 8 movie collection) from AmazonUK in September of  2011 for a delivered price of $46.00 in mid-November of 2011 (30 British Pounds).

Watching the movies and special discs on Blu-ray, and this one again, It was an enjoyable movie with good lighting. I can only surmise that the single movie, on the DVD disc that I received was an extremely poor transfer and low quality disc. The difference was night and day.",1260316800,5,1402,4.4319066147859925

I own all the others, but won't be adding this one to my library.  IMO, if it weren't produced, it wouldn't be missed.",1260316800,3,406,4.36
3276043,3,B000ZECQ08,"I have to say I was extremely disappointed in the movie adaptation of the Half Blood Prince to say the least! The Burrough burning down! What does that have to do with anything, least of all the story? Nothing, doesn't even make sense.

Like many of the other reviewers, I was sorely let down by the fight at Hogwarts and the death of Dumbledore. First, how could they have cut out Harry being paralyzed by a spell from Dumbledore to immobilize him from trying to save him?  If Harry wasn't paralyzed into inaction he would have fought to his death to save Dumbledore. That is who Harry is, not some sniveling weakling fretting over the obvious demise of his hero and mentor.  He NEVER would have just stood there, NEVER!

What about the battle that took place between those living at Hogwarts, the auror's, and the death eaters?  That was a pivitol and extremely important part of the book, a defining moment, and they just chopped it right out!  UGH!

How in the name of all that is holy could they even think of cutting out Dumbledore's funeral? What were they thinking?  Here is one of the MOST IMPORTANT characters of the whole series, dead, and they spend no time on it at all!  How could they cut that?! Inconceivable! I truly resent it actually. Talk about ruining it. I swear if they add the funeral at the beginning of movie 7, which results in taking up precious filming time(because it should have been in film 6, not Harry trying to pick up some chick and various other stupid add ins),my head will spin around!

Dear director, could you please NOT ruin film 7 by adding your stupid and pointless point of views? Just stick to the book, give us the funeral IF you still intend to stick to all of the important parts of book 7, tell us the story as Rowling intended(her way is brilliant) or I will write you a real letter cursing your career! We, as fans, have been waiting a long time for the conclusion of this story, please care enough about us to give us the story as Rowling intended it! There is absolutely no need to change or add anything!

What about the love story between Harry and Ginny? How could they change that? It was incredible in the book and so sweet. By the time they got together in the book you were soooo ready for it. Thanks movie, for ruining that too. UGH!
How could you leave out Dobby and Kreacher who have major parts in book 7? Huge disappointment.

Let's pray they do justice to book 7 in the movie adaptation. I truly want it to be epic!  It deserves to be; for us the fans, for J.K. Rowling(whom I hoped complained alot about movie 6), for Daniel Radcliffe and the other actors whom have given their young lives to this project, and for the amazing story itself. Please director do not blow it!

Okay I've vented!(at least I still have the books) Thanks for listening.  Here's to the brillant movie for book 7.... I believe! :)",1260316800,2,2873,4.425047438330171
3276044,3,B000ZECQ08,"Somehow the plot seems to have been overlooked in this movie. The book was fantastic but the movie is pretty dull.  I can't imagine why the screenwriter felt so much of the book needed to be changed.  After all, we fans have bought the series because of the story.  Why change it?  And time constraints won't work as an excuse.

 The opening was just ridiculous as was the burning of the Burrow.  Neither lent anything to the story; they were just there.  There is no reason why Dumbledore could not have picked up Harry at the Dursleys.  There was no point to those two incidents.

 A great part of the story is the interplay between the main characters.  This has been botched in this movie.  With every successive book the bond grows tighter between the 3.  Now Ron and Hermione been relegated to a back seat and Harry is kind of listless. Hermione was a smart and strong female figure, now she's a shadow of herself. The books show Ginny as another smart,strong, funny female character akin to Hermione.  Where is this Ginny in the movies? In my opinion the stand out characters in the movie were the always wonderful Alan Rickman and Jim Broadbent. They are consistently believable which brings me to the unhappy characterization of Dumbledore.  I can never reconcile the Dumbledore in the movies (excepting Richards Harris' portrayal) with the Dumbledore in the books.

 Are the director and screen writer so full of themselves that they think these changes are better then the stories we so avidly read?  Seems to me there is a lot of conceit here.

 The musical score is non remarkable and basically adds nothing.

 This is the 1st movie I'm not buying.  The 1st and 2nd movies hit it all right. Movies 3 & 4 were tolerable and then the real downhill slide began. I think the problem is those involved in the movie can't decide what audience they want to cater to; should this be a kids movie or an adult movie?  It ends up being neither.

 Perhaps Harry Potter is not a great piece of literature to those involved in the production of these movies.  However, as a comparison of fantasy, Mr. Jackson treated the Lord of the Rings trilogy with respect and each movie was a gem.

 As I watched the last movie I though of how great it could have been and frankly I'm saddened.  Perhaps those involved in the movies are just over the whole thing.",1260316800,2,2350,4.55023923444976

As such, this movie was a total disappointment: a completely disjointed story, (as someone else here said, if you have not read the books you could not possibly have a clue about what is going on), pathetic acting, with all except for the most experienced actors such as Maggie Smith, Emma Watson and Snape behaving as if they were reading their lines for the first time, at rehearsal, from the script. No emotions, no passion, no excitement, no suspense. Just a series of separate, dispassionate scenes lined up, one after the other. I blame the director and the script writer, not the actors, as all of them are experienced and could not possibly have acted this way except if told to - as my director-to-be daughter put it, they all seem utterly ""over-directed"". And why in the world include scenes that are not even there in the book and do not belong for a second? If the Burrow is burned down, where will they keep the wedding for Bill and Fleur later? My conclusion is that the director already knew that the one and only strength of this poor rendition of the Half Blood Prince would be its special effects - which are good, but cannot make up for the other shortcomings - and therefore added another scene with nothing but special effects, at the cost of the plot. I have seen all the movies, really like no 1 and 2, but I cannot stand this director and how he murders these stories - this one was by far the worst.

After a while, all the cgi storm clouds and magic mumbo jumbo just began to blend together into a big pile of ""I can't relate to this and I don't much care.""  All the charm, wit, and inventiveness of the early films seems to have been lost, and now the focus is just on the struggle with Voldemort, which is really not very engaging.  In the early films, it just gave the characters something to do while we got to know them and their world.  Now it's nearly all there is.

3276051,4,B000ZECQ08,"This entry in the series literally picks up at the end of the last.  The wizarding world has finally admitted what Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) have been saying for a year - Lord Voldemort is back.  And that leads everyone into a panic.  Ron (Rupert Grint), Hermione (Emma Watson), and Ginny (Bonnie Wright) are barely allowed to go back to Hogwarts by their worried parents, for example.

But back they and everyone else go.  Harry is captain of the Quidditch team this year.  Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) has started teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts, making way for Professor Slughorn (Jim Broadbent) to regain his long ago post of Potions.  And love is in the air as all our main characters seem to struggle with their feelings for the opposite sex.

Below the surface, trouble is still brewing.  Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) has been given a secret mission by Voldemort.  And Dumbledore has some memories and a mission of his own for Harry.  Will these missions mean that good can triumph over evil?

Let's start by being honest.  Odds are if you aren't familiar with the characters, you probably won't get what's happening here.  There are just too many of them and they are introduced too quickly with little to no explanation or back story.  If you have seen the previous movies, you should be fine.  But don't even think about making this your introduction to the Harry Potter world.

The other word of warning is to not go into the movie expecting the book.  You will probably be most disappointed by that here.  Instead of giving us lots of backstory on tom Riddle/Lord Voldemort, the film focuses more on the romantic stories.  I've got to admit, I enjoyed that.  I don't think I have ever laughed so hard at a Harry Potter film.  Plus we really get the return of Quidditch, which also provided some laughs.

However, this emphasis cut down on the amount of time we could focus on the story.  And this story really sets things up for the final book (or final two movies).  I think enough of the pieces were presented that you can just watch the movies and understand what is to come.  But one plot point I thought was important did get dropped.  I guess we'll see how they proceed from here.

I found the PG rating surprising at first, but I think it works.  Even with the romance playing such a key part of the movie, it is still more innocent in tone than the previous two movies.  That's not to say that the climax isn't dark, but it also isn't long and drawn out, which really improves the pacing.  It does leave one character's actions in doubt, but it's a minor point over all.

Frankly, none of the movies have been completely faithful to the books, but this one seems the worst of the lot.  If you haven't read the books, you won't notice the difference.  And if you have, try to let that go and just enjoy what is here.",1260230400,2,2879,4.536964980544747

I like that the pack comes in all the flavors of video, and thank goodness:  We only have one blu-ray player and HDTV (in the living room), my wife and daughter watch their movies in SD (DVD) in the bedroom, and I watch on the computer.  I also enjoyed some of the extras that came with this set.  I liked the additional scenes, and the lightning-round Q&A with the cast and crew.  There are also exclusive features for blu-ray viewers, if you have a BD-live enabled player.  I am also looking forward to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Orlando (sneak peek in this set).

""A boy who grew up in a cupboard, not knowing he is a wizard, destined to fight the most evil wizard of all time.""

Having not seen the movie when it came out in the theaters, I was pleasantly surprised with how the movie was put together.  The characters are all coming of age, and henceforth so must the plot.  The movie starts with Harry getting a date with a muggle waitress, while the rest of the characters similarly suffer teenage hormonal rage and sexual tension.  Oh, and they also do magic, battle bad wizards, and plot a way to destroy the evil Lord Voldemort.  If you expect it to be just like the book, be prepared for the disappointment.  However, if you keep an open mind and understand the director's/writer's prerogative, then the movie will surely be a pleasure to watch.  It is a great feel-good movie, but you sort of have to know the entire saga to understand this.  One can see that as the series progressed, so did the dark theme.  This movie is quite gothic, and drips of doom.

My disappointment is in the lag time between the books and the movies.  This movie has drained much of the urgency from the screen adaptation, which seemed to have come across as an afterthought, significantly more so than the previous films.  This is the source of the missing star on the rating.

For the time being, I will not review the movie plot since there are tons of movie reviews for HP 6 and the Half Blood Prince.

A strong 4 out of 5 stars (not fully earning the 5 star rating).",1260144000,3,2491,4.880952380952381
3276055,3,B000ZECQ08,"There was alot to shove into this HBP movie, as with all of the movies, to do some sort of justice to the books. Saw the movie and  I have pre-ordered it to add to my collection, but there isn't as much anticipation with this one. There was plenty to like about this movie,I guess there were pivotal moments in the HBP book that I assumed would have made it into the movie, but didn't. Also there were add ons that didn't quite fit.

Like the prior post, Dumbledore with the Dursleys was absent,and instead it shows Harry in the beginning planning a hook up with a muggle waitress? It would have been enjoyable to see Dumbledore and Vernon Dursley sqare off in Muggleland on the big screen. Then there is Hermoine having a yelling spat with Lavender Brown over an inert Ron Weasley in the sick ward. Again in contrast with the book.  I did not get any romantic connection between Harry and Ginny at all, probably due to the waitress at the beginning of the book, it seems to have dampered that possibility, and made it seem like they were just getting jumbled in together instead of showing a more believable connection. The burning of the Burrow made no sense, and they could have used that waste of time to dedicate to Dumbledore at the end of the movie and try to show a better effort of keeping to the book on that level. It would be in Warner Bros best interest to not switch around the release dates for the last 2 movies like they did to the HBP, due to the fact that the hpye was not justified, and this movie had too many add ons that clashed too much with the book.",1260057600,,1575,4.296296296296297
3276056,2,B000ZECQ08,"Among other disappointments with this movie was the ending. In the book Harry is immobilized and cannot do anything when Dumbledore is killed. In the movie he is not even immobilized and he just stands there and does nothing! The Harry Potter I know would in no way have just stood there and let Dumbledore be slaughtered. He would have tried to come out of his hiding place, screamed, tried anything to save him! The entire ending of the book was simply left out, too,as Dumbledore's death is just sort of glossed over. And where were all the questions in Harry's mind as to how Dumbledore could not know that Snape was on Voldemort's side? These questions Harry asks himself are extremely important to what is to come. Finally, is this a Harry Potter story or just a love story? I think the makers of this film wanted to appeal to the teenagers in the audience rather than make a faithful adaptation. I thought this was the worst of the movies yet.",1259971200,4,950,4.52906976744186
3276057,2,B000ZECQ08,"This review is for the film.. i will updated once i get the DVD.

I was incredibly disappointed when i saw Order of the Phoenix. Its my favorite book of the series and they completely butchered it on film. I went to see Half Blood Prince thinking that it was going to be a different experience..and I was right.. it was WORSE! They concentrated too much on things that weren't important to the story (romances are you serious?) and cut scenes that SHOULD have been included (battle in hogwarts). The most disappointment though.. was the ending. Dumbledore death...well.. it wasn't as sad as it was in the book. It was very emotionless to me. What was up with that?

It had some good. The visual affects were amazing... and the acting improved quite a bit. Tom Felton did an incredible job as Draco Molfoy. Kuddos to him!! Unfortunately it wasn't enough to save the film. I was more bored to tears than anything else. I hope the last installment its worth watching!",1259971200,3,964,4.598837209302325
3276058,2,B000ZECQ08,"When a movie of a book is made it's understandable that not everything in a 400+ page book is going to end up on the screen. However, I can see no reason why the film can't contain most of the key story elements. The first two films, directed by Chris Columbus, did very well at this. However, subsequent films tended to veer away from Rowling's genius-level storytelling in order to emphasize pet interests of the producers/screenwriters/directors. Whoever was responsible for these messes has a lot to apologize for. Obviously, they are going after market, changing the stories to suit what they perceive as the prime audience for their films, and presumably they conceive of this audience as largely never having read the books. All sorts of extraneous material is introduced and key Rowling settings and subplots are left out. And it's not just a matter of what's left out but of focus. Key gut-wrenching climaxes in the books are breezed by in the film, in order, I suppose, to pack in more teenage angst. Anyone with even a modicum understanding of storytelling ought to be able to come up with a screenplay that preserves the focus of Rowling's storytelling, particularly the breathtaking drive toward the final climax, which is a keynote of her stories and among the best in the biz. It astonishes me that this should be completely ignored by the makers of the Harry Potter films. I am tempted to attribute this to an intentional effort to drive more profit out of the various properties, but a niggling suspicion lingers that they are just inept and clueless, yes, and rather egotistical to imagine they can better stories, which emerge from Rowling's pen, compelling, dynamic, and in every way worthy of the worldwide phenomenon they have created.",1259971200,5,1757,4.899328859060403

I realize there are time restrictions for movies, but when I couldn't even explain what some of the scenes or plot was about to a casual fan friend of mine, that left me sad. How about at least giving us fans an ""under edited"" version for the DVD! Come on, the burrow never burned down and Dumbledore died, where's the funeral scene! These last two theatrical installments are miserable! I'm just completing  collections at this point. I just hope they don't flub the final two movies. At this current rate of deviation, they might as well make Harry Potter a vampire in a homosexual love triangle in the deathly hallows movies! My advice would be to read the books for a plot, see the movies for mental imagery then, reread the book to figure out what you just saw. p.s.(the audio books are awesome!)",1259452800,8,844,4.552631578947368

3276061,3,B000ZECQ08,"Warner Brothers latched on to a cash cow with the Harry Potter films.  Based on the incredibly popular books by J.K. Rowling, the series has followed the exploits of young Harry from his freshman year at Hogwarts Wizards School through his maturation into both young man and wizard, wary of his powers.  The film series has kept the same three principal actors throughout the series; they have literally grown up before our eyes.  ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" is the latest installment.

We first see Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) in a subway eatery, perusing a newspaper that questions whether Harry Potter is the Chosen One.  Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) mysteriously appears to enlist Harry's assistance in convincing reclusive Prof. Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent), once a teacher at Hogwarts, to return.  His memories about a former student, Tom Riddle -- who grew up to become the dreaded Voldemort -- are needed to help determine how to defend against and banish the evil entity once and for all.

The film spends a lot of time on flirtations between Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) and Harry and Ron's sister, Ginny (Bonnie Wright).  Lavender Brown (Jessie Cave), fellow Hogwarts student, also has eyes for Ron.  These tepid romances don't really go anywhere and are tossed in out of deference to the novel and the fact that the Hogwarts trio are beginning to look pretty old not to have an interest in romance, however chaste.

As with the previous Potter films, this one is visually stunning, even though director David Yates has gone for a more somber palette.  With its combination of spectacular vistas and dazzling CGI work, ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" is one of most beautiful-looking films of the year.  Though we've seen  Quidditch matches before, the one in the current film far surpasses them in terms of energy, excitement, humor, and sheer visual splendor.  It's one of the film's highlights in terms of pure exhilaration.

Mr. Radcliffe, who's spent half his life playing Harry Potter, is OK but doesn't have a heck of a lot of razzle dazzle this time around.  He's not as much fun to watch as in earlier installments.  This may have to do with the movie's darker nature, but the script does have opportunities for lighter moments that never materialize.

I was disappointed that Hermione has been relegated practically to an extra.  She interacts very little with either Harry or Ron, and plays her romantic scenes awkwardly and unconvincingly.  Mr. Grint fares better with screen time, but Ron is never involved fully in the adventure at hand.  He's there for scenes in which Ron and Harry talk about their respective infatuations, but contributes little more.  The romantic -- if you can call them that -- interludes become tedious and slow the action considerably.

Mr. Broadbent is a welcome addition to the new film.  This is an actor who effortlessly conveys the essence of whatever character he's portraying.  His Prof. Slughorn is intelligent, absentminded, guarded, mysterious, troubled, and fearful, as required.  It's fortunate that Broadbent is portraying a major character, since he commands our attention whenever he's on screen.

Many characters from the earlier films chime in with a few bits of dialogue here and there but are otherwise unnecessary to plot.  Prof. McGonagall (Maggie Smith) shows up halfway through as the voice of caution when Harry becomes increasingly involved in elaborate intrigues.  Prof. Severus Snape (Alan Rickman), filmed mostly in close-up, delivers his menacing lines with dramatic pauses you could drive a train through.  Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) pops up, only to fall asleep for most of his screen time, and Prof. Flitwick (Warwick Davis) ambles about more as set dressing than plot ingredient.

Tom Felton's Draco Malfoy has a larger role than in previous Potter films and is seen lurking in dark corners, traveling to cryptic locations, and secretly plotting.  Mr. Felton has the knack for looking evil at all times, playing his role with little dialogue and a disturbing sneer.  The actor who really makes a commanding impression is Frank Dillane as 16-year-old Tom Riddle.  Shot mostly in close-up, Mr. Dillane conveys a maturity and intelligence mixed with malevolence that comes through perfectly.  He appears in only one scene, but he's one of the best things in ""Half-Blood Prince.""

The major problem with ""Half-Blood Price"" is that it's a transitional film, promising but not yet delivering the good stuff.  It is often ponderously talky in an attempt to keep the viewer up to speed, but memories are short.  The script assumes an awful lot of knowledge on the part of the viewer, and only a devoted reader of the books will easily recognizes nuances and foreshadowings.  I was reminded of ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and how disappointed viewers were at the inconclusiveness of that ""Star Wars"" installment.  The same holds true for ""Half-Blood Prince.""  The final scene is really a setup -- even a commercial -- for the upcoming two-part finale, ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,"" to be released in 2010 and 2011.  Don't expect all plot points to be tied with a neat bow.

""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince""  is far too long at two and a half hours plus.  Though it is always visually remarkable, it will likely confuse those who don't know Potter lore, chapter and verse.  For Potter fans, it will be a delight, as they will fill in the blanks left by the screenplay.",1259366400,3,5501,5.015435501653804

3276063,4,B000ZECQ08,"i completely and inequivocally agree with  z hayes (plano,texas)  on every aspect that she touched on.  Book 6 in the Harry Potter series was my absolute favorite and the movie just did not do it justice.  it was a decent movie if you've seen all the movies but never read the books however, if you've read the books it would be hard, if not impossible, to give this movie 5 stars.  really, im stretching it to give it four.  the added scenes add nothing to the movie and most of the scenes from the book that weren't in the movie were vitally important to the plot and progression of the characters and story.  im not going to give anything away, i just need to say that the movie was a disappointment.  the characters are amazing in that the actors portraying them portray them perfectly and with the necessary depth.  my only hope for the final 2 movies is that the directly sticks to the book and doesn't go on about adding more unnecessary and meaningless scenes.  given that the final book is in two installments there is no reason not to lay it all out there and just really go for it.  more action, more depth, more special effects, more everything.  for those of us that have been following the series through 7 books and 6 movies i think it is vitally important to give us what we've been waiting for.  if i may say so, we aren't looking for the directors interpretation of what the book should have been, we are looking for exactly what the book was laid out on screen in all its glory from start to finish.  for me, the whole point of the movie adaptations lays in the success of this last one and by success i mean accuracy, depth, and wow factor.  i want to leave the theater feeling like it was all worth it and in this one i really just didn't and that's not even including the disappointment and irritation that stemmed from the fact that my favorite book was a let down on screen.",1259280000,5,1898,4.337110481586402
3276064,4,B000ZECQ08,"Mainly I just wanted to point out that I too loved all the books and have seen all the films, many times.

What I'd like to point out to all the detractors out there about book to film adaptations, is that you really need to quit complaining that films don't match up to the books, ANY BOOK.

There is no way anybook can be made into a film word for word or plot point to plot point. Movies would be over six hours long. You need to appreciate films for themselves. You will always find something wrong with any film if you look for it.

The fact is you need to be able to sit back relax and let the ""film"" not the ""book"" entertain you. Also most films based in metaphysics or science fiction need you to leave logic and embrace the the notion of suspending belief at the door. So please just take the time to enjoy the films you watch for what they are 90 to 150 mins of escapism, a place to leave the worries and stresses of everyday life and relax to a good story.",1259280000,6,967,4.078947368421052

I didn't care for the fact that Dumbledore had met Harry at the train station. I was really excited to read in the book that Dumbledore had gone to the Dursley's and took Harry out of there. I was also disappointed when they didn't have Dumbledore's funeral. They pretty much just let him lay dead on the pavement. I thought the cave was exciting and i was really happy that it turned out the way it did in my head when i read the book. I thought it was a bit dark and different for the Harry Potter series. I liked that the writters incorporated the fact that Tonks and Lupin were in a relationship. I thought that it could have had a better ending.

It's like comparing apples/oranges, Tupperware/tool boxes, Ford Temp/private jets etc.

I watched this one before I saw the others so I went back and watched 1 all the way up to this (I finally understand it). In comparison to the first 3 the films do get better as they progress; less character development and more of the good stuff. If you're wondering, I'm not much into reading fantasy books.

After sneeking a view of snippets of this movie online and how ""reserved?"" ""lackluster?"" the emotional content displayed in two of the crescendo parts e.g. Snape's ""mercy"" killing of Dumbledore and the ultrication between Snape and Harry makes me hesitate to order this DVD. I think now I will wait and purchase it second hand and help someone else defray the ""disappointment factor"" cost of this travesy of a movie. The only thing movie producers pay attention to is money. There is a way to get your point across. Borrow it from the library.

Addendum to this review after borrowing the library copy;
OK, giggle..... I watched a library copy of this movie with my husband who was more entertained watching me watch the movie rather than the movie. He is well read and has belonged to literary clubs thoughout his parochial and college level schooling. That being said, the story line was so scattered he could not follow it and began asking logical questions. I spent nearly the entire movie as a ""voice over"" helping him pick up the pieces to where the plot was going (well, supposed to go) and he needed assistance to pay attention to small clues that should have been prominent. (Like Dumbledore's injured hand) that appeared to anyone who had not read the book or listened to the library audio book enroute to work as I did, rather normal looking.
I was at a total loss as to why wasted movie footage showing the Burrows being burned. As if we needed to be shown that Death eaters were really ""bad"" guys. And what is with the scene of Hermione's date thowing up a mouthful of Dragon balls in front of Snape? Did Snape smell alcohol on his breath to warrant a month's detention? I must have missed something here. The emotional climax of the entire book when Harry finds out the true identity of the ""Half Blood Prince""  was such a let-down. In the book, Harry was supposed to be horror stricken and in his ""out of mind"" emotional agony of loss and betrayal, beg Snape for death as a release from it. When that does not work, Harry attempts to taunt Snape into such an frenzied anger he kills him. In this movie, Snape announces he is the Half Blood Prince almost as if he is grudgingly administering another school detention and walks off screen..........""What was that?""  No funeral or noticable tears for Dumbledore. The wands raised aloft prompted my husband to jokingly ask me where the Bic lighters were to flick on for better light at this lame concert.
The movie was far worse than I originally suspected.  I do not know who is most at fault, the screen writer Steve Kloves or director David Yates. I do not hold up hope or interest for the last two installments. This movie series has become progressively worse with each addition. Chris Columbus directing the first two years and Alfonso Curaon with the third movie are far superior in content and story line.  Like I mentioned in the beginning. Do not waste your money on this purchase. Your most enjoyable time will be to buy the audio book and listen to Jim Dale's voice. The movie created in your head while you do something useful like drive or do dishes will be much better. The vocal renditions of nearly all charaters by Jim Dale are far better than this movie. Wonderful voices.. Creature's voice always gets me laughing out loud.......and ""Oh Gawd,"" if Jim Dale could only mimic the deeply sensual, velvety vocal tones of Alan Rickman's Snape then there would be no need to suffer through the bad movie.",1258502400,12,3497,4.632258064516129
3276074,2,B000ZECQ08,"Harry Potter the books I have yet to read... But Harry Potter the movies I have seen and own all so far. I loved most of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire better then most of the other films (what with all the dragons and mermaids! And this was even before I read or saw Twilight and knew of Robert Pattinson - don't judge me, I'm weak and a ""sucker"" for a good vampire romance) And, although (according to my mom who has read all the books) there is apparently so much more then the films can show - I still liked all the films... That is until I saw The Half Blood Prince. It felt short and left me very much confused... To me it should have been either a double feature with the next film or like what they did in Underworld Evolution where you have a bit of a ""prequel"" feeling and then it goes into the next part of the story.

3276076,4,B000ZECQ08,"First off, I gave it 4 stars because compared to the other movies, it was closest to the book, even if they did do some stupid changes to it. Plus, I love Harry Potter, and am a HUGE fan of all books and movies. However, the reasons below are why it did not get 5 stars.

ATTENTION!!! SPOILERS AHEAD!!!

I have to agree, that there were many things about this movie that was really, really disappointing. The scenes left out, most disappointing, can we get a movie that at least sticks to the books entirely? The scenes added...burning the Burrow down, honestly, what the hell was the person who thought that up smoking? It leaves so many open questions as to how well they are going to do the next two movies.

The pensive/Dumbledore's lessons were not given enough time. In the seventh book, the pensive plays an important role in how Harry comes to realize Severus Snape was really on his side, and truly had cared for his mother, which plays a role in the final fight against Voldemort. Not to mention, showing Harry the reasons why Dumbledore did what he did.

Burning down of the Burrow means that they are either NOT going to show the scene where they get Harry from the Dursley's to the Burrow, or they are going to change it. Plus, they will either change or leave out the wedding, which means they will need to change how they show that the ministry has fallen. In turn, that means changing most of the facts from the movie, including how the death eaters catch Harry, Ron and Hermione, since saying ""Lord Voldemort"" made the enchantments break due to the death eaters in the ministry making it so. Not to mention Rufus Scrimgeour (minister of magic) dying and to Harry's surprise, protecting him and not revealing his whereabouts. How in the world are they going to have anything at the Burrow with it burnt down? And if they are going to have the Burrow in the next movie, it means an unnecessary scene of explaining how the damn thing is still there, which they will HAVE to do since putting that scene in. It was entirely unnecessary to have the Burrow burn down, even if they did have the death eaters show up there.... Oh, and at the wedding is when we are first introduced to the deathly hallows, the sign on Xenophilius Lovegood's robes, and Viktor Krum introducing the first of the backround that they find out about it. It does play a role as well in their 'quest' in the 7th movie.

Okay, enough on that scene, what about adding the beginning in like that...he was supposed to be waiting for Professor Dumbledore at the Dursleys..Dumbledore had much, and I mean much to say to the Dursleys, including reprimanding them for not treating Harry as he had asked them to. Plus, he tells Harry of him owning Grimwald place and Kreacher. Hmm, doesn't a big chunk of the 7th book take place at Grimwald palace..I see more unnecessary scenes added in the 7th movie.

Scrimgeour not in the movie at all..not even mentioned...what about when they give Harry, Hermione and Ron the inheritance??? Are they really adding a scene to explain who he freaking is??? Seems like they will be adding a lot more to the 7th to explain things they messed up in the first 6. (Meeting of the muggle minister isn't as important, but I would have liked to see it closer to the books. For some reason, when they make movies, they think completely changing it will make it better, and it never is...when will they learn...)

""Tonks rescuing Harry from the train? Nope, now it's Luna, looking for Wrackspurts, and removing Harry's invisibility cloak with her wand. (As A Deathly Hallow, it should be immune to summoning and/or levitation charms.)"" I quote this because I totally agree, again, mistakes made that true fans are noticing, and it does nothing but discredit the makers of the movies as being egotistical and arrogant enough to think we would like their version so much better when it leaves so many holes.....

Harry and Ginny's first kiss was pathetic and should have been done the way the book shows since Ginny IS Ron's sister, and the consent from Ron, being Harry's best friend, was important. Plus, they left out Harry breaking up with Ginny at the end and that was definitely important. Again, egotistical directors, screen writers, etc...

The Gaunt house memories and Voldemort's reason for the locket becoming a Horcrux are gone....as well as the memories of Helga Hufflepuff's cup and Voldemort asking Dumbledore for a teaching position....

Snape's ""Defense Against the Dark Arts"" lessons...ummm hasn't it been a point in all the other movies that he's wanted this position, and then they don't show it when he has it...IDIOTS!!!

Harry finds Mundungus Fletcher stealing property from grimwald place, and it's important for the next movie because he steals the locket. And they must track it down, which leads us back to Umbridge having Moody's eye on her door and the locket. She also attends Dumbledore's funeral, which they left out. Which would have included Scrimgeor talking to Harry about him helping the ministry. Which they didn't show at all in the movie, and which is very, very important!

Harry finding out that Snape was the one that betrayed his parents to Voldemort by telling him the prophecy was extremely huge... and they don't mention it. In fact, Snape's role is very, very small compared to what his role in the book was. He should have had a little more limelight as trying to help Draco, and Harry and Snape issues and finally Dumbledore and Snape's plans and issues...nothing....

Harry being stupified by Dumbledore in the end to protect him was key as 1)that's why he was disarmed and 2)come on, Harry just sit by and watch them kill Dumbledore...that wasn't believable at all....

The death eaters fighting those at Hogwarts...not one scene....

THEY TOOK OUT DUMBLEDORE'S FUNERAL!!! SERIOUSLY?????

HOWEVER!! As far as comparing to the other movies, it is closest to the book, I must say than the others, just wish some KEY things would not have been skipped or changed.",1258070400,4,6013,4.717826501429934

While the performances and overall look of the movie were well done, I don't understand why the choice was made to give such short shrift to:
- the revelation of Snape as the Half Blood Prince
- Dumbledore's death
- Dumbledore's funeral
- the battle scene after the funeral

Ah well. We have Deathly Hallows to look forward to, and though I'm further disappointed that they chose to do it in two films rather than a longer one with an intermission (they used to do that, you know, when attention spans were longer), one can only hope they'll treat the final installment with a little more respect.",1257984000,6,750,4.555555555555555

I hadn't really thought of all the parts they'd taken out, I will say that for every scene they took out, there's another in that _was_ in the book. So in my mind, they couldn't have it all, and it came down to weighing which ones to keep in.

With regards to the two scenes that are causing the most controversy, the burning of the barrows and the waitress scenes, I'm willing to look past. It's a movie, and it's playing towards a movie audience, whether they read the book or not, and these two scenes are overly dramatic/cute as such.

For me, a Harry Potter fan who has only gone through the book(s) once, it was a fun experience. I will say Lavender made me cringe a few times, but I feel like that was the point!

They're splitting the last book into two movies, which really it could fill up by itself easily, but here's hoping they catch us up on some stuff from the last book while they're at it.

David Yates has managed to take a crop of excellent and experienced actors and actresses, a wonderful book, and an inexhaustible budget and come up with a dark (muted colours and dim lighting making it literally dark, not metaphorically dark), confusing and lifeless movie that is frankly boring.  Those who have not read the books will find it very difficult to follow the story in this movie - it leaps inexplicably from setting to setting with no apparent reason.  Those who are familiar with the book will wonder why so much has been missed out, and why Yates has chosen to add to the story with inexplicable and irrelevant new scenes.

The dialogue has a few good moments - in particular the way that the boyfriend/girlfriend scenes are managed and the few appearances made by Luna Lovegood, but on the whole is lifeless and drab.  The irrepressibly awful Helena Bonham Carter dominates all the scenes she is in and is a major distraction.

Then the shows sould not sell out and real Harry Potter fans can see the movie.  Stay Home next time.  There are enough fans who will go see to make these movies successful.
 Learn like other people have said that movies cannot always be a faithful adaptation of a book.  Dont not judge this movie based on the others but what it was made for and probably how JK Rowling wrote the book for.  The movie and book are made to set the scene for what is to come the final battle.  Yes some things are left out but I feel if people read the books instead of just watching the movies then they will know these things that do not need to be spelled out in every movie.  If you haven't read the books I suggest you do so and you will see what JK was trying to do.

3276083,1,B000ZECQ08,"Where to begin, where to begin? Well, I guess I'll tell you that there will be spoilers in this review and that this is coming from someone who has read this book over 5 times. Well, I guess I'll start with my reasons for hating this abomination. Nothing in this movie matches up to the book except for SOME of the most basic parts of the plot. They couldn't even put in some of the basic parts of the plot to this movie. I didn't expect an exact replica on the big screen, and I did tone down my expectations after the mess that was Phoenix. However, I did expect to see a Harry Potter movie. Not a teen romance with Malfoy randomly throwing a bird into his magic closet at random intervals. The character's had no emotion whatsoever. In the book, the students and staff are beside themselves crying because of Dumbledore dying. In the movie, they all look at his body with a straight face and shoot some magic light in the air.

If I remember correctly, the book had something at the end... hm... I remember it was the most exciting part... maybe, a fight? Yeah, there was a gigantic battle right after Dumbledore died, as I recall. What I DON'T recall is the deatheaters blowing up the school right underneath the bedrooms and classes, and just calmly walking out the door. I also remember a funeral scene vaguely, where the entire plot was set up for the next book including a wedding. Oh, wait one minute! I forgot. In the movies Fenrir Greyback is a human, Ron's brother Bill doesn't exist to be turned into a werewolf or get married, and the Weasly's home BURNED DOWN. Basically, they have destroyed the end of the movie to the point that the next movie is un-doable.

The entire movie is a crappy teen romantic comedy set in the wizard world. I remember that there was some romance in the book, there was the half blood prince plot, about three or four more flashbacks, an actual explanation of the horcruxes as opposed to dumbledore's ""horcruxes are pieces of a soul in a random piece of crap"" explanation in the movie, there was some of theDursley's, there was some stuff about Sirius, and there was some business with the Order of the Phoenix. Yeah, instead we get, ""I love you more Harry"" ""No I love YOU more Ginny"" and so on with other random characters. I wanted to walk out earlier than halfway through, but was waiting for the battle that never happened. I definitely think that Dobby deserved an appearance after getting cut out of his appearances in 4 and 5, and considering what happens in Hallows.

The acting was pretty mediocre. Rupert Grint was good as Ron with what he was given. Emma Watson was boring as Hermionie. Daniel Radcliffe needs to learn that there's more emotions than pissed off and dead serious. Michael Gambon epically fails as Dumbledore again (Who saw that one coming?), and the rest of the cast was pretty bland.

I felt no emotions other than pure disappointment and boredom coming out of this movie. I felt like an old rag when I came out and that mood lasted for a little while. I nearly laughed at how ridiculous Dumbledore looked falling off the tower in slow motion, and overall felt drained at the end.

Overall, the movie would be a complete waste of time to see, and a waste of money to bother paying for. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.  I would give it less than zero stars if it was possible, and never plan on going anywhere near this abomination ever again. I don't know if I want to bother with Hallows at this point if this clown is going to be directing it. Well, that's all folks.",1257465600,18,3545,4.471406491499227
3276084,4,B000ZECQ08,"*References to spoilers in book!*

It is difficult for me to give less than 5-stars for what I believe is a 6 out of 5 stars book. HBP, in my humble opinion, is one of the greatest of the Rowling series, as it gives a specific insight into the workings of the Dark Lord, and everything in Harry's life starts to make sense. I agree with previous reviewers that this is the darkest book yet, and I think that's one of the drawcards to reading this book. Dumbledore is Harry's protector, mentor, and in the end, the greatest sorcerer of all time; on the other hand, Snape's character is further developed and we are now finally forced to make the decision: is he, or isn't he??

-Good Things-
1) Jim Broadbent is an excellent selection for Slughorn, and his character is as jovial and unique as out of Rowling's novel.

2) I also believe this is the best performance by Michael Gambon as Dumbledore - he appeared too neurotic in the previous films, as Dumbledore is never supposed to be overly-nervous, as he always has an idea of what's going on. The scene in the cave is straight from the book, and we see Dumbledore exactly as Rowling had intended: a vulnerable person, just like everyone else. Plus, the setting was fantastic and very suspenseful.

3) Ron vs. Hermoine! Very enjoyable scenes between these two characters, adding extra humour to a very dark film.

4) Draco Malfoy's character is more prominent in this film, and viewers enjoy seeing a side of the younger Malfoy that perhaps is hinted in the previous films/books - overconfident on the outside, but different on the inside. This scene also shows a side of Harry's character that will further show in the final film.

-Bad Things-
1) For goodness sakes, WHY do they see it as their prerogative to change CRUCIAL sections of the book?? And then add other useless junk?? The waitress - completely unnecessary scene, as we get many glimpses of Harry's developing maturity in other scenes. It made no sense to add it. The fire at the Burrow - this is just plain ridiculous. The Burrow is the place of Harry's salvation, where the Order meet on countless occasions, etc. etc. I don't understand why they chose to burn the place up - where do they propose Ron's family live for the Dealthly Hallows dialogue??!

2) One thing I am really disappointed was removed from the films was the story of Neville's parents. They were NOT killed by Bellatrix Lestrange (as the previous film hinted) - and there was a key scene in this film that gives the background to Neville's determination to prove himself in the final book. Mr. Weasley's attack was removed completely. Moreover, there was what would have been a very funny revival of a glimpse of Lockhart connected with these events - I for one like these references back to earlier books, and am not happy with this exclusion.

3) They also seem to have removed the older Weasley boys from the movies, and this is not acceptible, as Bill, Fleur, and Charley play a key role in battle against the Dark Lord, and Bill's attack by the warewolf gives further credit to their parts to play. The upcoming wedding also sets the scene for the Deathly Hallows and I am sadly thinking perhaps this will be completely removed from the next film.

4) The pensieve scenes, including very interesting flashbacks, were also omitted. They were what makes the Dark Lord's story make sense, and the key flaw in his character. I think more time should have been invested into this story of Tom Riddle, rather than scenes that were not even in the book, and were silly to add.

5) Also, one word: SNAPE! WHY do they cut his role??! Alan Rickman is fantastic, and enjoyable to watch as Snape. They should retain his role, and stop putting his scenes on the cutting room floor.

So, why 4 stars?? Well, it is overall a good enough film, and it is enjoyable to watch. I am nit-picky as someone who has read the books several times, and has really enjoyed the intrigute story behind Harry Potter and Tom Riddle, so perhaps get a bit over-excited about scenes that are not specifically important. It is still a great film to watch, and it will certainly be interesting to see if they retain all the key parts of the final novel - since they're filming the final book in two films, let's hope they're doing this in order to keep all the important content and not simply for revenue raising.",1257465600,27,4370,4.589743589743589
3276085,5,B000ZECQ08,"I've been a huge fan of the book series and have loved all the movies thus far. This latest installment is clearly the best: improved acting from the young stars, plenty of humor, romance, and thrills. If you've enjoyed the previous films than this is a MUST!

3276086,2,B000ZECQ08,"Although I more or less enjoyed this latest installment in the Harry Potter film franchise, it clearly marks the final divergence of the films from their literary source material. From this point onwards the Harry Potter movies will have very little to do with the core of the Harry Potter novels.

There are a number of reasons for this, many of which can't really be blamed on anything other than the unusual circumstances under which the film series was created. Consider that the first HP film came out before the fifth of the novels had even been written. As a result some of the smaller details in that first film (and the subsequent three films) which at first glance through the pages of the book don't appear to have very much significance were, correctly (based on what the filmmakers knew at the time) cut or deleted from the films. The problem, now that the entire saga has been completed in the books, is that some of those seemingly meaningless details from the earlier books take on tremendous significance, some being absolutely vital for the correct and complete working out of the main story arc. Of course there is no way the filmmakers could have known this as even J.K. herself hadn't yet sat down and ""discovered"" their importance for the latter part of the tale herself.

But the overall effect on the film series is that vast swathes of the story have to either be dropped, clumsily crammed in with hasty and unconvincing supporting exposition that was missed in earlier installments, or totally changed in order to get to a suitable conclusion of the epic in its film version. In other words, the way the books conclude is now virtually impossible to accomplish with the final two films yet to come. (Think trynig to do ""Hamlet"" without Polonius, Ophelia or Laertes. While they might not, in and of themselves, be necessary to the action, without them how does Hamlet maneuver into the position he must occupy in the final show down with the King?)

The other disappointment at this point in the film series is that the ""magic"" is pretty much gone. The sense of wonder has now completely faded and magic is simply another ordinary aspect of the universe where a decidedly grim tale is occurring. In other words, watching this film (and I'm sure the final two yet to come) will be something of a trial. They are setting a tone that is unrelentingly grim, dark, depressing and, perhaps worst of all, rushed and shallow. I doubt if anyone who has never read any of the books or seen any of the other films would look at this installment and enjoy it very much. It now has the overall mood and feel of a cheesy Grade B horror flick. We tend to overlook or forgive that if we've followed every step so far, but in and of itself this latest HP is a weak, grim, sad little mish-mash that has long since left the books far behind.",1257379200,16,2847,4.589390962671906

I have read book 7 numerous times so I know what they are and it is facinating to me to see Harry and the gang just pass them by everywhere they go. This is what makes the moview so great. We all know what happens so lets just revel in that fact and move on to number 7 and 8. Lets also keep Mr Yates directing the last 2 OK.I also liked the comedic effect in the Half Blood Prince too.

Don't even think of learning something about Voldemort's or the Prince's past or intentions; for that you'll have to read the book, which just happen to be named after the latter caracter, but it seems the producers, directors and script writers didn't know/notice it. I can understand some parts had to be cut in order to fit the movie, but the cut turned into butchery and some important parts didn't receive a good treatment, such as the Unbreakable Vow scene, Dumbledore's pain in the Horcrux Cave, or the final battle in the Castle. Also, olympics jumps from one scene to the other and unnecesary ones such as the burning of the Weasly's family house made this movie not as enjoyable as the previous ones.

REALLY??????? Guh. I felt robbed by this movie for many reasons, but that was the biggest crime of all.

The result was that I felt like I was watching the movie fly by on a speeding train, as it rushed from one key event to another without really taking the time to explore anything in detail.

Now we follow up with ""Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"" and....what a difference.  There are plenty of cuts of course, no Harry Potter movie can be free of cuts without being waaaay too long.  But the movie's length was at least comparable to some of the others.  The 3 lead characters were as spot on as ever.  Michael Gambon finally brings a bit more warmth to his portrayal of Albus Dumbledor than he brought to the last few movies.  Tom Felton played Draco Malfoy with all the depth one would hope for in his most important role in the series.  Alan Rickman isn't seen too much as Severus Snape, but when he is he's as wonderful as ever.

This movie is a disappointment for fans of the books I imagine, as it was for me. I find it's treatment of young love insulting not only to teenagers in general, but to the actors and audience as well.

Disjointed enough however that one MUST have seen all the previous movies and/or read the books to follow the plot.

Really. I can forgive replacing the actions of one character with another character, to save time, I can even forgive eliminating whole chapters for the sake of brevity, but to change scenes, edit whole parts, and invent whole chapters???

Beware, below, there be SPOILERS! Don't read if you haven't watched!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some examples of lost scenes:

-Dumbledore confronting the Dursley's? Gone.
-The invention of a fight at the burrow, including the destruction of the whole house? Really? Where's Bill & Fleur going to get married next movie? (Oh that's right, in the movies, they AREN'T! Heck, they aren't even in -this- movie!)
-The ""Meeting of the Ministers"" scene? Gone. Heck there's absolutely NO sign of Scrimgeour -anywhere- in the whole movie!
-Tonks rescuing Harry from the train? Nope, now it's Luna, looking for Wrackspurts, and removing Harry's invisibility cloak with her wand. (As A Deathly Hallow, it should be immune to summoning and/or levitation charms.)
-The slow build up leading to the Quiddich victory kiss? Gone. Now just a ""close your eyes"" peck in the Room of Requirement, and this was done horribly!!
-The two months of Harry & Ginny dating? Gone.
-Harry breaking up with Ginny to protect her? Gone!
-Harry's ownership of Grimmauld Place and Kreacher? (Key for the next movie) Gone.
-The Gaunt house flash-backs? Both gone. And with them any mention of Merope, Voldemort's mother. Gone too the mention of her locket by Caractacus Burke.
-The memories of Hokey the house elf, and of Dumbledore's job interview with Voldemort? (Key for the next movie) Gone. In fact, all references to the valuable heirlooms such as Hufflepuff's cup are gone.
-Crabb & Goyle polyjuiceing into girls to stand watch? (would have been funny, but...) Gone.
-Snapes ""Defense Against the Dark Arts"" lessons? Gone.
-Apparition lessons and test? Gone.
-Hermione & Ron's Prefect status? (Well, since it wasn't mentioned LAST film, why mention it now?)
-Harry's appointment as Quiddich captain? (Not mentioned, only implied during the tryouts)
-Mundungus stealing Sirius' property? (KEY for the next movie) Gone.
-Snap's betrayal of Trelawney's prophecy to Voldemort? (HUGE!) Gone!!!
-Harry petrified by Dumbledoor to protect him? GONE!
-The Hogwarts battle between Death Eaters and Order members? (and Bill's disfigurement?) GONE!!
-Dumbledore's funeral? GONE!!!!

...oh sure, we'll probably get to see a few of the minor bits I've mentioned in the ""deleted scenes"" portion of the ""Deluxe"" version of the DVD, but for this screen version, We get such useless add-on scenes as:
-All the trees around the burrow (HP 2/the flying car shot) have been cut down and replaced by a marsh?
-Harry wandering the underground, and chatting up a waitress??
-The aforementioned Burrow fight and subsequent burning??

Not to mention, Harry NOT petrified, but willingly hiding and watching Dumbledore's assassination? (Does anyone besides me see how that fundamentally would change Harry's view of himself?) Yeash!

And WHAT the heck was up with Jessie Cave/Lavender Brown? Worst acting since Brother Sun/Sister Moon! They tested 7000 girls, and they picked a 2nd rate ham? In fact, they tested using the hospital scene, which was single-handedly the worst scene she did in the film!

Ok, ok, on the positive side, the Quidditch tryouts and match were well done, and Dumbledore and Harry's apparition is depicted quite well.

All in all, I am happy they are making Harry Potter movies, but they are -nothing- compared to the books, and THIS one should be prefaced with ""Loosely based on the novel by J. K. Rowling""!!",1256774400,768,4095,5.315301391035549

What in heavens name is the point of putting in stuff that don't even happen and leaving out pertinent parts. I can hardly wait to see how they destroy Deathly Hallows. I am so disappointed, the books were SOOOOO good and the movies started out good, Does anyone know what happened to the original Dumbledore and the original director?

3276098,1,B000ZECQ08,"Just to give an example of how inadequate this movie is, the title is ""the half-blood prince,"" and it's never fully explained why. They just gloss over it quickly during the rushed finale. Snape says ""by the way, I'm the half blood prince..."" wtf? No battle scene or funeral at the end.  They cut so much fundamental material out of the story, it is just unbelievable. Ends like Monty Python and the holy grail, did they run out of money?",1256688000,22,438,4.475
3276099,4,B000ZECQ08,"I think this is one of the better Harry Potter movies. I liked the humor, especially from Ron (Rupert Grint), who has more to do in this movie and makes the most of his opportunities. The special effects are great and the sense of impending doom is well conveyed via a clever use of muted color- much of the movie is almost sepia. Jim Broadbent, as might be expected, makes Horace Slughorn an interesting addition to the cast. Michael Gambon has not always seemed to find the role of Dumbledore coming naturally to him, but this time round he is at his most convincing. Alan Rickman, as ever, is the creepiest and most mysterious figure in the story, Helena Bonham Carter is the epitome of uncontrolled evil and Daniel Radcliffe brings Harry to life in a way that must now be second nature to him. Emma Watson as Hermione is a little sidelined in this film, but Bonnie Wright as Ginny is now very much a young woman and it's easy to tell why Harry is finally seeing her as something other than Ron's little sister.

The main issue for many people seems to be lack of fidelity to the book. Like most lovers of the books, there are scenes I would have liked to have seen, notably Dumbledore's visit to Privet Drive at the start of the story, but the movie has to be considered on its own merits. The last 4 books are huge and contain far more material than could ever be included in a movie. The director and screenwriter have to consider how to move the story along in order to get to the conclusion; and they have to produce something that will work on the screen. A book can look into people's heads, but a movie needs something to happen to make it watchable. I think they did a good job in this respect and brought the film nicely to the point at which the final showdown can begin. Everything that was included made sense in the context of the story, even though in many respects it wasn't the way the book did it. As other reviewers have said, forget the book and you'll find the movie works very well.

Why only four stars? Simply because the movie is not a complete and self-contained entity. It assumes familiarity with the characters and it leaves the story to be continued. The full set, when it is released in two or three years, will be five stars. This is an instalment in a series- but a very good one.",1256688000,8,2316,4.358796296296297
3276100,5,B000ZECQ08,"I decided to review this movie as I have read reviews of all the Harry Potter movies that have come out. The big thing I notice is that people are upset that they did not follow the book more. Have any of you nerds out there ever seen moveis based on books or comics before? They never follow the book or comic to the letter. I like the Harry Potter films more probably because I have not read the books to have any expectations. But with movies that I have read the book or comic, I don't go into it with the expectation that it will be the book to the letter. You need to go to movies for what they are, entertainment, and try to go and just enjoy them. Unless you are a movie critic, why go so crazy when they didn't make it the way you wanted. These movies are good movies. Film makers will change things from the book to make the movie flow more. Do you realize how long these movies would be if they followed the books to the letter. It would be like ""Gettysburg"" or ""Gods and Generals"", which are 4 to 6 hour movies. They were and are great movies, but they are not the best for theaters because of their length. The film makers are making Harry Potter films for theaters, not for direct to DVD movies. So when the next one comes out, go with no expectations, and see if you just might enjoy the movie more.",1256428800,9,1314,4.116731517509727
3276101,3,B000ZECQ08,"Many of these reviews are spot on. I felt that too much of the book was left out and that the effects were underdone.
My big disappointment is a small thing that just indicates that the care to create the feeling of the magic world was not there in this episode. The pictures in Hogwarts were just, well.... pictures. They did not move, they had no life. This is something that the entire movie lacked.
As far as buying this one, I just hate to do it only to find out there is an extended version coming out in six months. Because this seems to be a pattern for the greedy movie industry I will wait.",1256083200,2,600,4.181034482758621
3276102,5,B000ZECQ08,"Look here's the thing.

Movie and literature are just two completely different mediums. It's hard when you want something to be so faithful to a book without thinking of the big picture that in truth everything doesn't adapt well to the screen. I thought this was the best Harry Potter film effort yet, and those complaining about the ending while I agree it was severely changed I'm sure it's to heighten the suspense for all of the action that is consistant throughout the last book. This film deserves to stand alone as a great film. Not only have all of the students matured acting wise tremendously, but Michael Gambon pulls off really a note-worthy performance and never have I laughed so many times in a Harry Potter film. It paced, and it's best that has come this way.",1255996800,8,777,4.630434782608695

My husband, who has not read the books, but seen all the movies, was completely lost in this movie. I had to keep explaining parts to him that were in the book but not in the movie. Or explaining parts that were briefly touched on in the movie, but not explained well enough to make sense to someone who hasn't read the books. They screen writers have really fallen off the wagon in the translation of this book to screen. There were so many things in the movie that needed fleshing out and instead of doing that; the writers threw in scenes in the movie that weren't in the book. I truly hope for the sake of the last two movies that the director reads these reviews and realizes that he needs to find writers who will stay true to the books.

On a separate note, the acting in the movie was excellent. These kids have come quite a long ways in their careers and you can tell. I just watched the HP movies 1 & 2 the other day and it is impressive to see the improvement.

I can only hope for better things in the next two installments. I am seriously considering not adding the last movies to my collection if they continue to go downhill as they have. :(",1255996800,5,1266,4.142276422764228

3276105,4,B000ZECQ08,"As with everything Harry Potter related, I was uber excited to see this film. I was terribly dissapointed with the 5th movie, since it strayed so much from the book. I had high hopes for Half-Blood Prince but I was also a bit nervous. After watching it, I must say as a whole, I was still a bit dissapointed. I know, I really do, that you can't fit everything from a book into a movie. However, what I don't understand is if you have a plot pretty much handed to you on a silver platter, why must you toy with it and destroy it and change it and for what purpose? Yes, 70% of the film was all about romance and heartbreak. Fine, it was very well done and I can deal with that. But when it starts to interfere with the plot, well, then I have issues with that.

This was deemed a 'darker' Potter film and yet, besides the end, I saw nothing of it. The romance aspect really brought things out of balance. And making the film PG did not help matters. Changing characters' personalities did not help matters. And changing the ending certainly didn't score points. Maybe I am being picky but for once I would like to see a Harry Potter film true to the book in tone and plot, like the 3rd film. There is no need to include every minute detail, but please don't CHANGE what is already there. Why mess with perfection? The book was dramatic and it's ending surprising, dark and depressing. The movie's ending was just rushed and seemed to come completely out of nowhere. People that have not read the book would even be confused. Seriously, for those that have not read the book, did you even get the whole 'Half-Blood Prince' thing? Yes, you know who the Prince is, but do you know WHAT it is? There was just no explanation. It was just too rushed. The director and screenplay writer needed to spend less time on romantic scenes, and more on important plot points.

As for the cast, well, it certainly has improved. The 3 principals do a fine job with their roles and they clearly have matured in their acting abilities. I was very impressed. Michael Gambon as Dumbledore does a good job (though in my mind he will never really be Dumbledore), and of course, my favorite actor, Mr Alan Rickman finally has more to do, and yet, though played to utter perfection, still feels underutilized. Sad, really, all things considered...

The special effects are top-notch and flawless and they clearly get better with each film (unlike other things...)

I am giving this film 4 stars regardless of my gripes, because although they changed ALOT, the movie was still enjoyable and well, it IS Harry Potter.",1255651200,2,2589,4.490445859872612
3276106,2,B000ZECQ08,"Okay, so maybe I exaggerated just a wee bit for the sake of a clever title, but for a movie about wizards, Half-Blood Prince sure goes light on the magic. The major plot points and story revelations that made the book so captivating ( i.e. the importance of Horcruxes, the battle leading up to Dumbledore's death, and the mystery of the Half-Blood Prince himself) are reduced to random ""blink and you'll miss it"" moments, if included at all, while the remainder of the 2  hours is padded with unfunny romance blunders aimed at the pre-teen Hannah Montana crowd. Visually stunning as always, yes, but emotionally empty with no climax whatsoever. The director obviously had no vision of where he wanted to take the series and got absolutely nothing accomplished story-wise. I'm not criticizing based solely based on comparisons to the other brilliantly crafted Harry Potter films, or even to the book on which it is (loosely) based, although that is part of it. The bottom line is, it really is an all-around good example of bad film-making in and of itself.",1255564800,18,1056,4.834254143646409
3276107,3,B000ZECQ08,"Warning!  Major spoilers in review!  If you haven't read the books or see the movie, don't read!

The first two Harry Potter movies managed to sum up the contents of the books upon which they were based, but because the books themselves weren't terribly good (the series as a whole is a masterpiece, but not based on the first two books), the movies were terribly good.  There was none of the darkness, danger, and depth of the later novels.  The final three novels in the series turn the Harry Potter series from a merely good series, to what is quite probably the finest long series of books ever written for children (though adults will find them quite as good).  Unfortunately for the films, the books are simply too complex and deep to satisfactorily compress in a film.  At least that is true for THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX and THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE.  We'll see with THE DEATHLY HALLOWS.  Stretching the finale over two novels may make it more successful, but it won't help this film.

I unfortunately made the mistake of seeing this only a few days after rereading THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE.  Had I not, perhaps I wouldn't have been so acutely aware of the tremendous compression taking place in this film.  Huge hunks of the book are eliminated, other hunks are compressed powerfully into rewritten, reimagined sequences.  There are literally hundreds of small alterations, most of them simply to save a few seconds of narrative to get the film to fit the 150 run time.  A few such moments can be forgiven, but the film comes across more as an endless succession of compressions.  Plus there were some odd additions, such as the odd attack at the Weasley's house at Christmas by the Deatheaters.  I didn't mind much seeing the actual attacks by the Deatheaters at the very beginning.  I think that actually gave a nice edge to things.  But by the end of the film I felt like the entire story in the book had been distorted and deformed by the need to force as much of the book's story as possible into a format completely insufficient to contain it.

I didn't actively dislike the movie; I was frustrated by it.  It felt too rushed to provide anything even remotely comparable to the book.  Only the very end of the film had something of the same experience as the book, though even there significant changes were made.  For instance, in the book not even Dumbledore can disapparate from Hogwarts, but instead goes into Hogsmead with Harry to do so.  And in Dumbledore's great death scene, Harry merely hides, not even under his invisibility cloak.  And Snape discovers Harry in the tower before he kills Dumbledore, which sort of signals that Snape's role with regard to Harry is more complex than we might have supposed.  And there is no great battle inside Hogwarts.  This is important because it changes entirely the tone of things.  One of the great things in the battle was the way the other members of Dumbledore's Army come out to fight, with Hermione, Ron, and Ginny engaging in their own acts of bravery.  I could go on and on and on.

Now, I understand as well as anyone that movies are not exact replicas of books.  But I think that film versions shouldn't gratuitously change the book without cessation unless it produces something good in its own right.  The film ended up with some good things, but not as many as it should have.  I liked a lot of individual scenes.  I enjoyed seeing the always enjoyable Jim Broadbent in his role as Slughorn, even though it was as inappropriate for the role as anyone in film (isn't it sad that Leo McKern is no longer living? could anyone have been more perfect for that role than him?).  I loved Alan Rickman, who is possibly the only thing in the movies better than the books, his Snape embodying far more depth than the endlessly one-sided Snape of the books (excepting the final novel).  And it is always great seeing Michael Gambon in anything (THE SINGING DETECTIVE still remains one of the greatest television productions I've ever seen, and while Dennis Potter's amazing script is what made it so great, Gambon is what brought it to life).  I enjoyed the special effects, which were effective without calling too much attention to themselves.  And I've enjoyed watching the group of actors grow and mature in their roles.  Some of them have changed enormously over the years.  Tom Felton (Malfoy) has gotten quite tall, while Bonnie Wright (Ginny) has grown as tall as Daniel Radcliffe.  And Matthew Lewis, who started the series as one of the shorter cast members, is now one of the taller ones. I really like how the main three actors have gotten better as the films in the series have progressed.  I frankly thought Daniel Radcliffe was not very good in the first film, but I think he has become an exceptionally proficient actor.  I think all three will have good post-Harry careers of they want to.

I think fans of the movie may or may not enjoy this.  I always enjoy entering the world of Harry Potter (I'm at this very moment about a third of the way through rereading THE DEATHLY HALLOWS and so had some enjoyment of this film.  But I also found it an enormously irritating experience.  It may be that those who have not read the books might like this more than those that have.  but at this point, has anyone not read the books?",1255478400,19,5300,4.613247863247863

In general, I found the movie thrilling and suspenseful, the characters easy to care for and an overall success. There were a few points left out which is forgivable due to time constraints as it is already quite a long movie. The only thing that I would have changed is that about half way through the movie, there is a strange scene that was an addition from the book. I won't go into detail as I don't want to ruin it but it seemed unnecessary and also could prevent important events from occurring (or at the very least change them) in the movies to follow.

The fire at The Burrow was well done, and added another dimension to the movie.  However, the only inkling we got of the relationship between Lupin and Tonks was her calling him sweetheart just before the attack.  Very jarring, even for those of us who knew they were a couple.

There were a lot of scenes that were very well done, but what made the movie for me was Dumbledore.  Michael Gambon finally got the character right and just in time.  His interpretation of our beloved headmaster in the previous movies left me cold, and I was concerned that I wouldn't care about the character's final fate.  Not so.  Those final scenes were everything I could have wished.",1253836800,4,856,4.6466666666666665
3276112,3,B000ZECQ08,"I have not read the original books by J. K. Rowling, so my review of the sixth Harry Potter film is purely based on my experience of seeing the film alone, not comparing the adaptation with the original. And my simple impression is this; Harry Potter needs a new director. OK, I know it is too late, but I believe I am not the only one who feels that way about the latest entry.

As you know, there is one crucial episode involving major character(s) at the end of ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince."" Remember, before you actually see this fairly engrossing climax, you have to wait very long. I know the sixth installment of Harry Potter series has to lay the groundwork for the two-film finale - ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part I"" and ""Part II"" - so the film's long running time (153 minutes) is understandable. Still, the wait is very long.

That is because the filmmakers have no idea how to create a compelling narrative. Director David Yeats handles everything in the complicated interactions between characters surrounding Harry as if making a series of formulaic TV shows. The film goes on and on, but doesn't know where it should go. The suspense is half-hearted at best and the film fails to build up any tension toward the climax. The romances of Harry, Ron and Hermione are told without style or nuance. As to the titular ""Prince"" it seems they forget this should be one of the key elements that play an important role at this entry's ending. But what should I expect from the director who in the previous Harry Potter film wasted brilliant Gary Oldman and his intriguing character Sirius Black in such a horrible way?

I am not saying ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" is a terrible disaster. It is not. With the first-rate actors, first-rate production designs (Hogwarts are so beautiful) and first-rate effects, it cannot be. Still this is the weakest link of the series, and I am afraid it is not because of the book itself.",1253491200,9,1965,4.640804597701149
3276113,1,B000ZECQ08,"I'm a great fan of the books and the first four movies.  I was sorely disappointed in David Yates' adaptation of The Order of the Phoenix and afraid he'd do as poorly with The Half Blood Prince.

As a bit of background, I re-read Order of the Phoenix before seeing the movie and was, probably, more disappointed than I might have been had I not been as familiar with the text at the time I saw the movie.  At that point I made a vow not to re-read Half Blood Prince before going to the movie.  Unfortunately, it was a vow I was unable to keep.  I read the book, aloud, with a friend, just before going to the movie.  I should have known something was up when I was able to show up at the theatre on the first weekend of the film's opening and just buy two tickets for the same day (I live in NYC)!

The books get darker as the series progresses and Half Blood Prince is the darkest yet.  There are so many things in the book that serve to set up The Deathly Hallows and so few of them were actually portrayed, or portrayed well, in the film.  I was devastated to learn that David Yates was directing the last two films, as I was so unhappy with Order of the Phoenix, however, ""unhappy"" doesn't come close to the way I felt after actually seeing Half Blood Prince.

I question whether Yates has ever read the books (and if he did, did he like them???) or if he only read the treatment for the scripts?  There are several places in the book that cause me to not just cry, but to weep.  I wondered if I could make it through the movie and not look like a complete dishrag when I left.  I believe this will illustrate my feelings fairly well:  When the credits rolled, I looked at my friend and said, ""So, where do you want to eat?""

I don't believe I shed one tear and I think that says it all.  If you want more: you know how die-hard fans always stay for the credits?  Almost the entire theatre got up and walked out as the credits began to roll.

Will I buy this 1-star DVD?  Yes, I want to complete my collection and I continue to have hopes that the two-part ending will, somehow, be better--although with David Yates at the helm, I very much doubt it.  What a shame.",1253404800,42,2169,4.131264916467781

3276115,1,B000ZECQ08,"The other Potter films told the story badly. THIS one didn't tell the story at ALL. Watching it is like watching a series of random, animated book illustrations. Oh, here's the scene where Slughorn is introduced, here's a scene where some black chick hits on Harry Potter, here's the scene where Ron sucks at Quiddich, here's the scene where Hermione has her feelings hurt for some reason, here's the scene where Dumbledore sets fire to a bunch of zombies, and now Dumbledore is d- I mean, incapacitated. (No spoilers!)

I read the Harry Potter books, and I remember the story. When I see a movie adaptation of a book, I expect to see a story reproduced in movie form. Yeah, maybe the movie's story will not be exactly the same as books story, and maybe the movie will not be as good as the book; but, at the very least, I expect it to be, oh, you know, A MOVIE, with a plot and everything. I don't want to see a character simply walk onto the set, announce that he's Snape, and act out a few random Snape scenes. If I wanted to see a bunch of disconnected characters jumbled together I'd go to a Harry Potter convention or something.

Oh, and by the way, all of these moving illustrations are pretty ugly. You know, just because this movie is supposed to be ""darker"" than past wizard movies, doesn't mean they have to literally film it in black and white, and design the set to look as soul-sucking as possible. Oddly enough, there's actually a scene where Harry Potter stands in front of Hogwarts, which now looks like the bleakest place on earth, and says, ""I forgot how beautiful this place is."" Pffft. Why can't he see the irony?

After I saw this movie I complained the about the bad writing to someone who saw the movie, but never read the book. She claimed I was being too hard on it, she claimed she understood the plot perfectly. So, I asked her who the Half-Blood Prince was. Her response?

And then who would have thunk it, but no Voldamort either. The last thing I was hoping for was a teenaged hormone-ladened skit. Though at times, Harry's humor was semi-entertaining, the only true Potter parts were the scenes with Malfoy. Quite frankly, the entire story line in the movie was irrelavent to the series. And the fact the 7th book had long ago been released ( and read) took all the guess work out of this movie. We already know why Snape killed Dumbledore and that Snape is the unsung hero. It has taken me this long to write a review for the sheer fact I was having trouble admitting the movie was a failure. Even the music score was pieces taken from past movies. Will I buy the DVD when released ? Of course.

Gambon is a great actor, but until this installment, I did not think that he adequately portrayed the character that fans of the book hold so dear. He was alternately too gruff, too clueless, and too weak. I think that this must have been due to writing instead of his acting, however, because he was GREAT in Half Blood Prince. Even with the added scenes that were not in the book, I felt that this installment remained truest to the book. I went to see this movie three times- and this is coming from someone who never goes to the movies. I am truley surprised that other reviewers have not given HBP more stars. To me, it is obviously the best attempt to remain true to the books to date.",1252713600,12,893,4.385542168674699
3276118,4,B000ZECQ08,"Love is in the air at Hogwarts, as Harry finds himself attracted to Ginny while Hermoine is attracted to the new quiddich sensation Ron who is attracted to someone else and so on.  While this may be harmless, there are forces at work that are anything but.  The death eaters are growing in strength and becoming more vicious, killing several muggles in a terrorist attack.  Diagon Alley is all but deserted, only Fred and George Weasley's joke shop is thriving.  Hogwarts has increased security, incoming students are being searched and the entire school is surrounded by a magic force field.  Harry is recruited by Dumbledore to convince former Hogwarts professor Horace Slughorn to return to Hogwarts as the new potions teacher.  The task proves simple.  Slughorn is eager to return to Hogwarts, particularly with Harry Potter as a potential student.  Harry will later be required to do things not so simple.  Dumbledore believes Slughorn has valuable information that could be used against Voldermort and hopes Harry can find it out.  Slughorn has taken a definite liking to Harry, who has become one of his better students.  Of course, Harry has some help.  He is using an old potion book with very accurate notes courtesy of ""the half-blood prince"" (whoever he is).  Unfortunately, there is danger.  Despite the security precautions, Dumbledore is the target of assassination attempts.  Harry suspects Draco may be up to something, he has already been seen with wanted criminals.  Later on, death eaters attack and burn the Weasley house to the ground.  Eventually, Harry gets Slughorn to give Dumbledore a memory that confirms Dumbledore's worst fears about Voldermort, and a way to destroy him!  Will Harry and Dumbledore be able to use Voldermort's own strength against him?  Will they uncover the truth about the assassination attempts?  Will they be able to survive a Trojan-horse style invasion of Hogwarts?

Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince reminds me of the start of A Tale of Two Cities - ""It was the best of times, it was the worst times.""  In some ways this is one of the best Harry Potter films made.  In others, though, it lags.  The storyline involving Ron Weasley and quiddich could have easily been done away with, the teenage romance could have been reduced to a couple of minutes.  Fortunately, the movie resolves its teen angst portion in time to get back to the main plot.  That is why Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince has been a success.  On the one (forget it!)  to five (excellent!) star scale, I rate this four.",1252281600,,2552,4.899532710280374
3276119,3,B000ZECQ08,"This remarkably well balanced series of wildly successful films based on an equally popular series of novels by J. K. Rowling shows no signs of waning with Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.  Potter veteran director David Yates and keeper of the flame scribe Steve Kloves have kept together a burgeoning franchise that is laying the foundation for a grand finale.

A new school year begins, and Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is coming to terms with being the `chosen one' to do battle against the ultimate in evil wizardry, Lord Voldemort and the evil Death Eaters surrounding Hogwart.  Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) enlists Harry to serve as bait to draw out the supremely evil Voldemort.  An older Professor Slughorn (Jim Broadbent) returns to the school and brings with him a mysterious history of having taught the boy who became Lord Voldemort.  Harry in the meantime discovers a manuscript by the `Half-Blood Prince' and thinks that it is the key to learning the wizardry secret that will enable Harry and his comrades, Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) to defeat the man who killed his parents and godfather, Sirius Black.  Harry's school rival Draco harbors revenge against him for the death of his evil father.  There is the aerial game Quidditch that challenges Ron's mettle, and the blossoming of adolescent romance between Potter and Ron's sister, Ginny and between Ron and  Hermione.  Then there is Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) and some mysterious behavior that questions his allegiance.  As Dumbledore makes Harry promise to do whatever he instructs, the Death Eaters are unleashed within Hogwart with devastating consequences and a shocking betrayal that will forever change the destiny of the school and foreshadow the coming showdown with Voldemort.

This is a more grownup Potter as it explores relationships more thoroughly and some amusing situations arise such as a love triangle that plagues Ron.  It is amusing to see how hormones are thriving amongst the teens and love is in the air.  Growing up was never this hard. There are also surprises of a high order that will send the series on a new, ominous path while raising questions about the loyalty of a major player. The one constant is our beloved trio of maturing wizards who must face an uncertain future without an important character.  The film reinforces the continuous themes of loyalty and friendship among our wizard heroes.  That bond and natural chemistry among the three actors is partly what holds this remarkable series together.

Most of the characters are back from the previous film Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.  It does feel like school has restarted when Professors Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall (venerable Maggie Smith) show up.  Other familiar faces reappear, which greatly help in the continuity and progression of the story.  The filmmakers are wise to introduce a couple new characters here and there without shaking up the status quo too much.  All the Potter films have benefited from a strong focus on storyline in keeping with the novel sources.

Production values are topnotch again, and the dark, moody colored cinematography is an artistic triumph. It is impressive at how mainstream films have pushed the creative aspects of filmmaking without sacrificing popularity; witness the cinematography and art direction of The Dark Knight and the film editing in The Bourne Ultimatum.  It has almost become pass to expect imaginative state of the art special effects in the Potter films, but they are always serving the plot and not merely to draw attention to the spectacle itself.

Since these are British performers, there is a bit of adjusting to their heavy British accents.  This film, perhaps more than any other, assumes that the audience is already well versed on Potter lore, and so it may prove a bit confusing to the uninitiated.  It starts out well and tries one's patience just a tad as it builds a complex narrative that loses steam half-way through and picks up momentum toward the end and never lets up with a devastating payoff which in turn sets up the two part finale in grand fashion.

Though not the best film of the series, The Half-Blood Prince sets the table for the final battle of good versus evil.  This must be a pretty good film because I can't wait for the final installments.",1251590400,,4355,5.004160887656034

3276122,4,B000ZECQ08,"This is the sixth installment of the Harry series, and by now, Harry has grown resigned to the fact that being the Chosen One might put a damper on your love life.  In the opening scene, it looks like he might get lucky, but then Dumbledore shows up with yet another mission.  This time it's to recruit Professor Slughorn (Jim Broadbent) to teach at Hogwarts.  The plot is the same essentially; as Voldemort tries once again to defeat Harry and fails. Throw in some Quidditch footage, wacky hormonal high jinks among the Hogwarts' student body, and some cool special effects, and there's your movie. Only Tom Felton as Draco has replaced Voldemort as the designated sneerer, which is good because he's a lot more photogenic.

As reviewers have noted, you won't understand the title's meaning unless you've also read the book.  It might not matter much now, but could require some more explanation in the next two movies.  Then and again, if you're just seeing it for entertainment and not because you care about the books, it shouldn't matter. If you are familiar with the books, though, you will probably be going, ""Huh?"" at a few scenes.",1250812800,,1139,4.756345177664975

Granted, reducing 650-odd pages into a motion picture that runs in a reasonable amount of time is a daunting task, but forays into totally made up sequences (specifically the visit of Bellatrix LeStrange, Fenrir Greyback, etc to The Burrow), does nothing to advance the plot.

However, I did enjoy the interior of the set of the Hogwarts castle, as they made it seem much more like what I would expect a castle to look like.

Much more could and should have been made of the pensive sequences, especially with regard to Dumbledore's admonition to include Ron and Hermione in what Harry learned, especially given its relevance to the final book.  Much more could also have been made of Harry's obsession with discovering what Draco was up to, although those seemed to lack any real hint of what was going on in those sequences (but I have to admit that I liked Tom Felton's portrayal as well as his costume).

Yes, I'll get the DVD when it becomes available, if only to have the complete collection.  I just hope I don't also find a Draught of Living Death handy when I watch it.  Come to think of it, maybe Steve Kloves was under its influence when he penned this abomination.",1250726400,10,1454,4.65625
3276124,4,B000ZECQ08,"Professor Minerva McGonagall: [to Harry, Ron, & Hermione] Why is it, that whenever anything happens, it's always you three?
Ron Weasley: Believe me, Professor. I've been asking myself that same question for the past six years.

Short attention span summary (SASS):

1. Dark times are at hand for both wizards and muggles, as the Death Eaters wreak a destructive path across both worlds.
2. Draco has a special assignment from you-know-who, which has his mum distressed enough to seek a bodyguard for him.
3.  Hogwarts turns into hormone central as teenagers start getting googly-eyed, and sometimes enlist magical assistance in matters of the heart.
4. Quidditch is always good entertainment, and so is a little walk down memory lane, a hunt for a dark treasure and a dramatic ending.
5. Still not enough Bellatrix Lestrange (the always amazing Helena Bonham Carter) - MORE MORE!!!

This is a rather good interpretation of a book that was largely about young love at Hogwarts (except of course for the ending), and although it was long, it held the interest painlessly.  I never expected much from this one, seeing as it isn't much more than a scene setter for the two grand finales, and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was.

The young actors have settled down well in their roles, and the rest of the cast fit as comfortably as always.  Jim Broadbent makes a perfect Horace Slughorn, and Alan Rickman, Helena Bonham Carter and Dame Maggie Smith (albeit in a small role this time) continue to excel.  Kudos also to Bonnie Wright who plays Ginny Weasley, a character that has finally come into her own on screen.

Highly recommended for all Potter fans, even if only to get your fix before the next movie.

Albus Dumbledore: You must be wondering why I brought you here.
Harry Potter: Actually Sir, after all these years I just sort of go with it.

The Burrow is destroyed (didn't make sense in the movie and wasn't in the book)so where will the wedding take place?  What wedding?  Bill and Fleur weren't in the movie or even mentioned.

The film is dark and captures the gravity and seeming hopelessness that accompany the Dark Lord's return; however, the movie also captures the determination of Harry and his friends to fight the emerging evil, no matter the cost.  The actors have come into their own and have really grown into their parts, much as Harry, Ron and Hermoine have grown and matured in the books.  The biggest quarrel is the liberty taken with the Weasley's home...didn't happen in the book and really unnecessary in the movie (gratuitous at best).

3276128,5,B000ZECQ08,"The Harry Potter saga continues with, argueably, the best installment to date ""The Half-Blood Prince"".

 Scarred by his experience stemming from the events in ""The Order Of The Phoenix"", Harry Potter is reluctant to return for year six at Hogwarts. Professor Dumbledore encourages him to continue on, taking Harry's help in enticing former Potions Professor Horace Slughorn to return to Hogwarts.

 At the school, Harry & Ron borrow textbooks from the school for Slughorn's Potions class. The previous owner of Harry's copy, the ""Half-Blood Prince"", has annotated the book with additional instructions & spellcraft that allow Harry to excel in class & win a vial of liquid luck.

 During private meetings held throughout the year, Dumbledore shows Harry memories of a young Tom Riddle & reveals Slughorn retains a memory critical to Voldemort's defeat. Harry retrieves the memory & it reveals that Voldemort had been seeking information on Horcruxes, devices that safeguard a portion of the creator's soul, thereby granting him immortality until the Horcrux is destroyed. After learning the location of another Horcrux (Voldemort has six of them total), Dumbledore requests Harry's help to retrieve it.

 However, Voldemort has given Draco Malfoy, Harry's rival, an assignment. An assignment that casts a deadly spell over Hogwarts & spells certain doom for the faculty, students, & the school's future.

 The overall power of ""Half-Blood Prince"", is the storm, that the other five films have been fortelling about, has finally arrived & this is the beginning of the end for all things Potter.

3276129,5,B000ZECQ08,"The Half-Blood Prince is so far my favorite Harry Potter movie which I was surprised by because besides the ending there is not much progression in the overall story.  This movie sets out to set up for the 7th films and build up the relationships and it succeeds at both.  The most important part of the film is that it is well made, the acting is spectacular, the effects are impressive, and the scenes flow together better than the last few Harry Potters.  To touch on the acting, Jim Broadbent is brilliant as Professor Slughorn, whose facial expressions were hilarious.  Michael Gambon holds his own and gives an impressive performance.  Finally Alan Rickman is given a bigger role and he shines also.  The three main characters go through a lot with their relationships in this one and they handle it well.  I felt the film found the right balance between comedy and action.  If it weren't for the comedy the film would have that Dark Knight feel (loved the film) where it is entertaining but also very dark and depressing.  Overall, although Voldemort does not make an appearance, the film is the darkest and for me was the most entertaining.  If you liked the other movies (particularly since 3) you should really like this one.  Some things are changed from the book but nothing major.

I gave Yates credit for creating a workable adaption of Order Of The Phoenix.  That was a very difficult book to make into a single film.

The Half Blood Prince lacks heart.

Yates nails the romantic relationships (Lavender is especially great), but this film is almost completely humorless.  No chaos, no ghosts, no delight, no madness, no fun.  It's dark, and it's only going to get darker.  Yawn.

The biggest travesty is Jenny and Harry's first kiss.  That was a fantastic moment in the book, which Yates inexplicably made Hollywood ordinary.

Michael Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore, yet again, misses the character.  The actor steadfastly stated that he refused to read the books.  I'm not sure WHY he thought that this would benefit his characterization.  It does not.  I've cringed watching him screw up one of the most important characters.

If you want a GREAT adaption of all of the books, listen to the audio versions by Jim Dale.  Jim Dale single-handedly nails all of the parts.

Perhaps someone will make great film adaptions of the Harry Potter books in my lifetime.  These films feel like an endurance test, not something be excited about and relish.",1250035200,13,1302,4.836363636363636

3276133,1,B000ZECQ08,"I'm a big Harry Potter fan. I've read all the books at least 3 times, and watched all the movies just as many. This movie is the most disappointing of the lot for several reasons.

Writing: The writers of this movie should be fired. They make up the beginning of the movie, when Dumbledore pick up Harry; they include quidditch again( what's the point); they make up a sequence where the Burrow is destroyed, but DON'T include important things like the will of Sirius Black, Harry hiding the book, Dumbledore telling Harry what he believes the Horcruxes are( and obviously the memories where these objects are shown), the fight against the death eaters in Hogwarts and the funeral. The story is just incomplete in this movie, even more so than in the Order of the Phoenix, because what they left out in this one are so crucial to the storyline.

Editing: The movie has no flow whatsoever. They jump from one scene to another in fast pace with no transitions, without bothering to properly end one scene before another starts. It makes for a not very enjoyable movie.

Acting: The three main actors make Steven Seagal look like an Oscar winner. Other characters, like Lavender Brown or Ginny are just as poor. The adult actors are better, but still not as good as they would be with more talented youth.

There are some scenes that are good, though. Katie being cursed and Dumbledore fighting off the Inferi are the two most memorable ones, but they just don't make up for the poor writing, editing an acting in the movie.",1249689600,39,1521,4.643122676579925

3276135,5,B000ZECQ08,"The first time I hear Harry Potter'books it was by a friend who bought the book to her son. He has enjoyed the books and my friend too. I have to say I was not convinced. Another friend told me she was delighted to read the books that she borrowed from her nephew. She is a contemplative sister and as I know her I was not surprised. But I have waited to watch the first movie. I have liked all the movies til now.
When the last book was published I decided to buy all the books at once. However, if my mother tongue is French but I decided to buy them in English to enjoy more the books as I watched all the movie in English. I read all the books at once. I enjoyed them a lot. I read them again and again. I watch the available movie again too. The main reason makes me enjoyed Harry Potter is how the author offered us the story of a boy who is growing old in each book. In each book I have seen Harry Potter to act according to his age and no more. When I read the seventh book I was amazed to discover that the adult characters had a life outside of the books. I have started thinking to make the movies in these conditions was a big challenge because only the author has known where and how she wanted to lead us till the end of the story.

I understand that to make a movie with so many characters around Harry Potter is very difficult. And also the size of each book growing like Harry Potter growing older was certainly making the writing of the screenplays quite difficult. That is why I appreciate the Half Blood Prince a lot. It is different from the books but the spirit of the books is respected. The movies offer us another perspective of understanding sometimes. But I do not forget that it is movie language and not book language. The quality of the movie narration is very good. It is difficult to forget for a while the seventh book if you already read it and watching the sixth movie. But if you try watching the movie in the perspective of Harry Potter it becomes very dark with some moments of brief light as the movie director wants.

A last piece of advice go and watch the other movies made by each actors playing adult characters. You will realize how wonderful actors they really are. Even Ruppert Grint.

So enjoy Harry Potter'movie like me. Do not forget you are only sixteen this time and you are full of grieves to lose those you love one by one just like Harry Potter.",1249257600,2,2400,4.2017353579175705
3276136,5,B000ZECQ08,"I thought it was the best film rendering of any of the books so far.  It left a lot out but it seemed to layer more information in around the plot proper than any other the others have, without things in the background, newspaper articles, subtleties in the frame...  I must say, the acting for the most part was spot-on.  Emma did the best in this one since Sorcerer's Stone.  She brought a lot more to it than eyebrow posturing, for a change.  Rupert was great, as usual, and Daniel has widely improved his skills.  He has progressively gotten better and better, but he was fabulous in this one.  I like that he gets to explore his comedic side, pincers included.  His potion drunk Harry was a lot like his lecherous celebrity child in Extras, which if you haven't seen is hysterical (Youtube).  Tom Felton really stepped it up as Draco, which in a way seemed to be breaking the wall a bit by revealing so much of his story so quickly, and not through Harry's perspective.  But then I thought that about how the book was written, as well.  Jessie Cave as Lavender was perfect.  She hit it right-on, and that's a big undertaking for a high profile character played by an unknown actress near the end of a huge film franchise.  I actually wanted to be on the bus for HP/GW, but even in the film I just didn't feel it.  Dan and Bonnie had no chemistry whatsoever, and that's too bad considering she's slated for minimal face time in the next installment and we're supposed to buy their relationship 100%.  Rickman, heavenly.  Just superb.  He really stole that film with his understatement of Snape.  The one that I thought and still think just does not capture the essence of the role as she was written is Helena Bonham Carter as Bella.  In the books Bella wasn't punch-nuts crazy.  She was evil and sinister, and Carter has missed that mark from the beginning.  That is a persisting disappointment to me.

This installment brought a lot more to the table, finally.  I'm pleased to see the series slide beyond children's film to a real, complex, plot.  The moments with Katie Bell and the inferi were truly horrifying.  The visits with young Tom were creepy and intensely sad, their correlation with Harry and the potential of both boys sufficiently entwined.  That same thing could be said of Draco, whose objectives are grim and melancholy, as well.  The cave scene sealed Dumbledore's fate for Harry as Harry accepted that rite of passage into his own power by agreeing to do everything he was told without question.  Harry's brush with Tom's ring sent shivers of compatibility through him, leaving the audience cringing and piqued.  Daniel nailed a unique body language for his likeness to Voldemort in the previous film, and he sealed himself as Harry, not just that guy playing him, by reviving it in this one.  Gone was the distracting angst of the last two films.  I still think that the grief over Sirius was never really processed in the books, thus isn't in this film.  Nothing in the story as it was given indicated that Harry had grieved and was past it, or that he had set it aside to push through the tasks ahead.  It just became a nonfactor and that's an oversight in the development of his character that is rarely touched upon in the film.  As well, the progression of the plot through the pensieve was lost in the film.  I don't think that what we saw in the film left viewers with enough appreciation of those memories or why they were relevant, to start with.  The missing funeral at the end was a let down.  I really wanted to see the visual display of that ritual, for the characters as much as for myself.  In light of that and the lack of processing of Sirius' death, the series (book and film) lacks a real ability to deal with death, yet the threat of that we're supposed to believe that is exactly what compels our young cast to save the world.

In all I have high hopes for the remaining film(s) in the series.  If they are done anywhere as well as this one we're in for a riveting treat.",1249171200,4,4018,4.503457814661134

As such, it does a masterly job of setting the stage of the hunt for the horcruxes and the sorting out of whom ends up with whom.  It also sets the stage, perhaps better than books, for why Harry doesn't become the head of Hogwarts and instead spends his life among the Muggles--he's certainly had enough excitement for a lifetime.  And as the ""famous"" Harry Potter he will also have had his fill of magic, potions, and spells.  Dumbledore would have wanted Harry to have a productive and happy life after such a tempestuous childhood; and if that meant setting aside the magic, well, Dumbledore would have understood.  When you lose everyone who means something to you (Mom, Dad, Sirius, Dumbledore, Hedwig), then being present in the real world to what is left (Ginny, Hermione, and Ron) is all the more important, especially more important than magic.  I've read reviews that fault Daniel Radcliffe for his performance, but I actually think he's done a really amazing job of illuminating the maturing Harry whose life will be more an illustration of his mother's love, than his father's youthful brashness with its streak of meanness.

3276138,5,B000ZECQ08,"Last night I saw Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince with 2 friends. One had seen (but not read the books) two films, and the other had  not read or seen Harry Potter. They loved the movie. And so did I. The movie is very dark (not just visually), the actors are good, better and superb. The movie script was excellent and kept very nicely with the book. The editing was superb (for a from book to movie). The cuts were so good that you know what happens between one scene and the abrupt move into the next: such as jumping from the inception of some action (as when Prof. Dumbledore tells Harry he will have to come with him to find one of the horcruxes).

I do know that the young actors are older than the characters they are portraying, but each one did an excellent job making their roles work. I may be suspending my disbelief because I want them to be what their characters are. We all suspend our doubts when we go to the movies. Afterall, we know what we're seeing needs the contribution of our imagination to make it work and be enjoyable.

All in all, while it does not have the wonder and liberated happiness of the first 3, 4 films, and I believe is somewhat over the heads of the many young people who love the HP series, it delivers on all aspects of a great evening at the cinema.",1248912000,2,1299,4.229838709677419
3276139,5,B000ZECQ08,"A well written script by Steve Kloves, beautiful cinematography by Bruno Delbonnell, the most emotional score by Nicholas Hooper, and great performances by an ensemble cast, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is the most charming, and magical so far of all the Harry Potter films released so far. David Yates, who's feature film debut was the previous entry Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, outdoes himself in this beautiful adaptation. At 2 hours and 33 minutes, the film's pacing was perfect thanks to the vastly improved editing by Mark Day. Many book fans will miss their favorite scenes, but should be able to appreciate the film staying faithful to the story. To those who have not read the books, its better to watch this film more than once, to let the story sink in, because a lot is going on in this packed film. Watch for an especially wonderful performance by actors Sir Michael Gambon as Professor Dumbledore, the beloved mentor of Harry and Headmaster of Hogwarts, and a hilarious but charming performance by Jim Broadbent as the new Potions Master Horace Slughorn, who will make you laugh and cry.",1248825600,3,1126,4.839378238341969
3276140,3,B000ZECQ08,"I left the midnight showing of `Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince' disappointed. Few critics consider any Harry Potter movie a masterpiece, but I enjoy every one. Understandably, significant scenes in the books must be altered or deleted in the film version. However, the changes made in this movie make the film far more tedious than the methodical but intriguing sixth book. The film's portrayals of some aspects of the story are spot on, but the film fails to build up to a satisfying climax.

The movie begins with a poignant shot of the young wizard Harry Potter being photographed by journalist after the traumatic death of his godfather Sirius Black. Further successfully sinister shots of graying sky ensue as black wisps soar through a skull-shaped cloud.

Unfortunately, this dark mood is never matched during the rest of the film. A sense of danger is never developed, and personal conflicts are far less acutely depicted than the outstanding special effects. Harry (played by Daniel Radcliffe) has even less personality than usual, and his love story with Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright) is ridiculous and unrealistic - even for a story about wizards. Instead of teenage sexual tension and a likeable, bold heroine, we get a temptress who is suddenly in love with Harry because ... the script said so. Ginny whispers lines as though she is some sort of teenage temptress, yet there is no chemistry there.

Hermione (Emma Watson) is yet again made to look very much like a stereotypical girl, weeping over her good friend Ron's (Rupert Grint) apparent rejection of her amorous affections (while she is emotional but far more plucky and resilient in the books). Much more interesting than Ron, Hermione, Harry, and Ginny are the two other love interests, Lavender Brown (Jessie Cave) and Cormack McLaggen (Freddie Stroma). Brown's infatuation with Ron is amusingly over the top, but Stroma's brief role as the boorish Cormack pursuing Hermione is absolutely hysterical.

Michael Gambon's caring portrayal of headmaster Dumbeldore is gently moving, and Jim Broadbent is excellent as Slughorn, giving depth to Harry's well-intended but batty and deeply flawed potions teacher. As Professor Snape, Alan Rickman is as always subtle, but his portrayal differs a bit from the book, arguably giving less impact to the characters ultimate role in the story. The death-eater and werewolf Fenrir Greyback (Dave Legeno) makes an appearance and looks fantastically threatening. Unfortunately, he is not given a single line or action to convey any aspect of his depraved nature. The character of Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) has vastly improved from his previous sniveling incarnations. In nearly every scene Felton and cinematographers convey his isolation, and he is as pitiable and dangerous as any terrified adolescent criminal.

Other highlights of the film include flashbacks about the evil Voldemort, known in the past as Tom Riddle. The two actors who portray him not only greatly resembled each other, but are spot on in their depictions of snakelike evil. The youngest Tom's (Hero Fiennes-Tiffin) subtle expression of delight at a display of power is chilling. The older Tom (Frank Dillane) possesses a sinister intelligence and serpentine manner.

`Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince' was probably the most difficult of the series to adapt because of its lack of a driving plotline, and the movie is thematically unfocused and at best uneven. Though I've read the books, I was frequently confused. There is much potential here, but little payoff.",1248739200,9,3558,5.211538461538462

It IS the best Harry Potter movie yet! I encourage EVERYONE to see it! Harry Potter is also for all ages....please do not pay ANY attention to the reviewers who say Harry Potter is not for kids - I feel J.K. Rowling made these books for everyone to enjoy!

3276142,2,B000ZECQ08,"My son and I went to see this movie yesterday.  I was so looking forward to it and after watching it I was very disappointed.  They took one of the smaller aspects of the book and focused on it.  The first three chapters of the book were not even in the movie!  I don't know what they were thinking!  The Harry Potter movies started going downhill with the Order of the Phoenix, although that one still wasn't too bad!  HP and the Half Blood Prince was just plain boring.  The movie is 1 hr. 53 minutes long and felt like 4 hours!  What happened to the action? And by the way what happend to the great musical score they had through the first four movies?  Why would they change or eliminate the theme song? The only redeeming factor was the acting was still very good which is why I gave it 2 stars.  They sure missed the mark with this movie.

 Makes me wonder what the final two movies will be like.",1248652800,13,902,4.180232558139535
3276143,5,B000ZECQ08,"You get your money's worth with the new Harry Potter.  We went to the 7:15 show and didn't get out till 10:05.  Well, we sat through 11 previews for films the theater owners must think will appeal to the Harry Potter crowd, but all of them look pretty crummy.  How bad does Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs look!  And what about that movie where the kid goes into the elevator of the Empire State Building at night and the whole elevator cab trembles with white light all the way up?  It looks like Harry Potter USA!  So naturally when the real thing came on it looked even better than it is, and that's saying a lot.

In short it was great.  I have a few nit picks because, well, I didn't reed the books and couldn't figure out half the stuff that was going on.  Luckily we went with a friend and could text back and forth saying, ""Mark, who is that woman with the crazy black hair?"" (Helena Bonham Carter) and ""How about the woman with the white hair?"" (Narcissa, her sister.)  That didn't take us much further.  I have seen the previous 5 movies but I sort of forgot, and when David Thewlis made his appearance at the Burrow I had completely lost trach of who Remus was.  Why didn't they leave him out, he certainly didn't add much to this one, and as for his wife, the poor actress who played her must have eagerly grabbed the script then screamed in despair when she found out she was only going to say one thing and wear one ugly outfit!  As for the family that adopted Harry, they probably were screaming even louder when they realized they had been cut out of the entire movie!

I liked Daniel Radcliffe, who has really grown as an actor, Rupert Grint not so much, but he was OK, but if possible Emma Watson has regressed!  Gone backwards!  Scene after scene left her defenseless, unable to organize even the semblance of a performance.  She's not even as pretty as she used to be.  Oh well, she's still great, but Luna and Lavender trample all over her acting wise.  The adults are just going through their paces.  A few times it looked like Dumbledore was catching forty winks, while talking.  Best performance, the zombie skeleton creatures who swim up out of a lagoon and snatch humans.  Afterwards we agreed it was some sort of allegory about people who are too needy.",1248566400,3,2282,4.39618138424821
3276144,3,B000ZECQ08,"Near the end of the movie, Dumbledore says to Harry Potter, ""I sometimes forget how much you've grown.""  Well, let me tell you, it must be senility, because he's the only one who hasn't noticed.  With Harry's five o'clock shadow and the clear growth shared by Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ronald (Rupert Grint), I half expected a McLovin fake ID subplot.  Either they've extended eligibility by red-shirting a year, or they failed a grade, but at this point they've been attending school longer than anyone except Radio.

As for the movie itself, it's stuck in a Twilight impersonation, with the aging trio gaining more experience with teen angst than wizardy.  Unfortunately, the threesome hasn't mastered an anti-aging spell yet, and they wander the halls of Hogwarts looking like the creepy old guy at the club, clearly years older than everyone else, and awkwardly out of place.

Meanwhile, Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), the pseudo-albino antagonist, is busy growing up into someone who looks like a Die Hard villain; which is ironic considering Professor Snape is played by Alan Rickman, a man who was the original Die Hard enemy for John McClane.  Add David Thewlis as Professor Lupin and the evil Euro-trifecta is complete.

Still battling the legacy of Voldermort is the key issue, with a few of his lackeys - most notably Helena Bonham Carter looking horrible - taking people away, killing others, and causing havoc.  There are also several fanciful potions and concoctions throughout, as Harry, Ron, and Dumbledore end up with reactions similar to the side affects of LSD, Ecstasy, and Meth, respectively.  Both are only minimal side stories, however, because the main point is to introduce drama and relationships into this edition, and inexplicably make a cute blonde like that red-headed train-wreck Ronald, not to mention Hermione's baffling attraction to him.  Too much of the plot was sacrificed, and too many holes are filled in by teen romance.

This is by far the worst of the Harry Potter series.  There are some great sci-fi scenes, wonderful special effects, competent acting, and some incredibly dark imagery.  It's a joy to watch most of the time, but some aspects of the plot are ridiculously lacking (e.g. Dumbledore can turn back time, but nobody can stop a fire?).  Additionally the kids, scratch that, adults, shouldn't be in Hogwarts anymore; they're a little long in the tooth.  Harry and his sycophants should be serving as adjunct faculty at this point, not taking ""Advanced Potions.""  Setting up another in the Harry Potter 90210 series - with obvious cameos for Brandon and Brenda Walsh - the movie ends on a down-note, with a huge spoiler (not for anyone who has heard countless rumors on the internet), and the first incomplete, and completely unsatisfying, ending in the Harry Potter series.",1248566400,7,2824,5.038709677419355
3276145,5,B000ZECQ08,"Out of all the Harry Potter films so far, Half-Blood Prince is my favorite. Why? Well, for one, it is a brilliantly well done film that once again allows the amazing acting to really shine through, and it also throws in subtle references to the previous films in the series as well as different pieces of plot from the books. Half-Blood Prince has it all: humor, style, flawless special effects, great acting, and a plot that is more powerful than any plot told in the films to date.

The villains are especially impressive, and they give performances that are absolutely memorable and chilling all at once. The teenage angst presented by our lovable protagonists is relatable and just as interesting to watch as the cool fight scenes are. Yes, this Potter film does it all in a way that will dazzle, amaze, and astound you.

This film takes place directly after Order of the Phoenix left off, with good 'ole Harry still recovering from his battle with Lord Voldemort. However, he is called back by Albus Dumbledore to aid in a mission to find out more about Voldemort's dark past and to try to stop the evil from becoming as powerful as it had been years ago. Trust me, by the end of the movie, your heart will be wrenched with emotions and your jaw will be slammed through the floorboards. It's really that good.

Everything from the editing to the special effects were done well, and done in a way so that they make you feel exactly what the director had intended you to feel. There are even some pretty jarring thrills sprinkled in with the happy-go-lucky moments and sweet smiles that the film will give you, plus it's laugh out loud funny and jump out of your seat terrifying all at once. This truly is a film for the ages.

The special effects, an area that has really bothered me in previous Potter films, have really been improved with this installment. The use of CGI is even less so than it was in the films prior to Half-Blood Prince, which is a god-send, and the CGI that is used doesn't look as ugly and is rarely the main focus of the screen. The characters become more fleshed out and the stage is set for the grand finale that we will experience within the next couple of years.

Without a doubt, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a film EVERYONE has to see. It has everything you'd want and expect from a Potter film plus it's simply a classic film all together. Potter fans will love it and movie buffs in general will be in awe by the time the ending credits roll. Trust me, you won't regret seeing this one.",1248480000,4,2536,4.468682505399568
3276146,3,B000ZECQ08,"This 6th movie in the Harry Potter series is tough to follow if you haven't seen the previous films.

Professor Snape (Alan Rickman, getting more from this role than ever) gets to slither into his darkness. And finally, Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton, who finally gets to act instead of posture) reveals where his hatred of Harry originates.

With all these ""dark secrets revealed,"" ""The Half Blood Prince"" doesn't answer them. The movie is still dazzling (the river of souls is amazing) and Hogwort's still inspires. The gang is acting their ages and getting up to age appropriate mischeif. But the movie ultimately stalls out...making it the weakest of the series so far.",1248480000,10,1671,6.136752136752137
3276147,1,B000ZECQ08,"Avoid. Dull, boring, and destroys the book. The only thing good about this
so-called film was the cinematography and Alan Rickman's Snape.",1248480000,23,138,5.318181818181818
3276148,2,B000ZECQ08,"This is exactly the kind of movie that concisely conveys what sort of generation we are raising - overweight, insipid, listless, boring, directionless, and dull. All those expletives still do not do full justice to the abject uselessness that is this film - one that meanders through scene after scene of some of the worst dialog you've ever heard - and the 'performances' are merely afterthoughts. Consider this a lab experiment gone wrong and all the mice are dead. Yet as a viewer, I bravely soldiered on, half-expecting the movie to raise its' bar and 'take off', so to speak. Unfortunately, this never quite happened.

Prime fault lies with the director and the uninspired performances by all the leads - but really, there is only so much they could do with such an over-the-top storyline that gives fantasy fiction a bad name. This wasn't the weakest story in the cannon - in fact, Lord Voldemorts' origins were explained here (in possibly the most interesting segments), and it also does contain Dumbledore's death - which came and went in the space of one minute (even less, I think). Considering the film kills off a major character, it seemed unusual that this was almost clinically filmed, with no interest in actual emotion or depth. A huge failure, all things considered.

The need to portray the children here as 'grown up' was most vile, with hideous love triangles that would test the patience of even an infatuated adolescent. For the rest of us, it was more proof that the series has far outstayed its' welcome, considering that past parts, such as 'Azakaban', were so dark, gothic and beautifully directed. This one is soulless and tepid - and by the time the endless Quidditch matches come your way, its clearly a case of one too many. Daniel Radcliffe sleepwalks throughout the entire proceedings in a performance that can only be called 'mind-numbing'. The same can be said of poor Maggie Smith who looked utterly bored with everything.

Gigantic plotholes seem to permeate the Harry Potter landscape. For example, everytime Hogwarts is under threat by 'dark forces', the combat strategy is to send everyone to bed. ""Off to your rooms, children!"" certainly can't work here, could it? But still, this is what they do. Also, Dumbledore can apparently travel at will to any part of the world in a split second, but at the end of the movie, he is trapped in a cave with Harry, and they use a good half hour of the films time to move from one end of the cave to the other using a boat that they manually pull out of the water. Ridiculous.

That said, it bears reminding that this is a childrens' film, and thus, expectations can never be too high. For what its worth, the first three or four Potter films were enjoyable and had its' moment in the sun. The deja vu you feel while watching this is inescapable, and this is the first Potter movie adaptation where nothing will make sense if you haven't read the book first. The final scenes which consist of Ron, Hermione and Harry gazing at the sky is meant to be 'breathtaking' but it only angers you as they come up with the most repugnant script to accompany this segment - everything is a mismatch, things aren't explained properly, and all of a sudden, the movie ends.

Two Generous Stars. How this made it past the editing table is beyond me.",1248393600,14,3313,4.685567010309279
3276149,5,B000ZECQ08,"The movie starts with Harry about to get a date.  Then, out of no where Dumbledore shows up.  (apparition anyone)  He tells Harry that he needs him.  He needs him to visit some one, an old teacher.  Dumbledore wants him to teach but the teacher always says no.  After Harry talking to him by himself (Dumbledore goes to the bathroom) the teacher still says no.  Then though he decides to do it.  So, now Hogwarts has a new teacher.  The teacher knew Voldemort when he attended Hogwarts.  Harry finds this out when Dumbledore takes a vile with a memory of his and dumps it in some water.  Harry puts his face in and sees the memory.  Dumbledore though, says it is a false memory.  He asks Harry to find out more about the teacher.

The second part of the story involves a school book that Harry got.  It says Half Blood Prince.  The book has things written inside that help Harry with his spells.  So much so that even Hermione can't keep up.  So, Harry tries to figure out who the Half Blood Prince was.  Turns out that it may be a teacher that is at Hogwarts.  One which Harry may not get along with.  So, this person in with whom Harry can't talk to may be helping him out.

Another part of the story, which ads humor, is the romance.  Ron has a girl who likes him very much.  Hermione may have a problem with this girl.  Ron keeps things going with her, always telling Harry about things they do together.  Poor Hermione is there as well.  She gets a little stressed and emotional when she hears him talking.  Something happens to Ron.  He is asleep in the hospital.  Harry and Hermione are standing by his side as well as some others and the girlfriend shows up.  After Hermione and her share some words they hear Ron saying something.  I will not say what it is.  But the girlfriend leaves.  Angry and hurt.  While Hermione remains, with a little added happiness.  Also, Harry starts to see Genie as something he could like.  She already seems to feel this way about harry.  So, what will happen with the two couples of friends?

Then, there is something strange.  Something that is given to a student.  By someone Harry and his friends know.  Malfoy!  The item is a necklace.  When the girl it is given to touches it, she almost dies.  They are able to save her, but she can not remember who gave her the necklace.  Harry figures it out.  Dumbledore tells Harry that the item given to the girl is something very dangerous.  Turns out that the item has something to do with the memory that the teacher has.  The one Harry viewed in which Dumbledore told him was a false memory.  Harry has to convince the new teacher to let him see the real memory.  He does so and finds out that the necklace was a horcrux.  An item that lets someone break their should into parts.  Each part is out into an item and hidden.  Turns out Voldemort has do this.  Seven times!  Harry and Dumbledore decide that they have to find them.  For if they do it will help with the defeat of Voldemort.  Harry and Dumbledore find a place that has one of the pieces of soul.  They go to get it.  Before they do, Dumbledore tells Harry that he must listen to everything he says.  If he says run, run.  If he says leave him their, leave him their.  If Dumbledore screams in pain to stop, then Harry must force him to continue.  Well, something big happens.  I don't want to give it away though, so you will have to watch and see.

In then end Harry tells Ron and Hermione that he cannot go back to school.  He has to find the Horcrux that Dumbledore and he started looking for.  Hermione tells him that sometimes, though brave, can be thick.  She tells him that they will all three go and look.  Thus the movie ends.  The movie flew by.  It was more serious than any of the Potter movies.  In my opinion that is.  You really feel like you have been there with them through it all.  They do a great job of making the characters feel like they grow with you.  It was all great and I can't wait to buy the DVD.",1248307200,,3980,4.277027027027027
3276150,5,B000ZECQ08,"I've read the book and listened to the Stephen Fry narrated audio version.  Films are not meant to duplicate the literal experience of the novel.  This film stunningly succeeds in avoiding that trap.  Whenever it can tell the story visually and artistically rather than through dialogue and linear plotting, it does so.  Its visual style reminds me of Cocteau's ""Beauty and the Beast"", Gilliam's ""Brazil"" and Bergmann's ""The Seventh Seal"". Mesmerizing from the first surreal opening reel to the end, this is every bit deserving of its current box office success.  Harry Potter and friends now live in a world which Lord Voldemort has insidiously penetrated at every level.  Both the magical and mortal worlds are on the verge of collapse.  Harry with Dumbledore's assistance must find the way to defeat Voldemort.  As they explore one memory after another, they discover that Voldemort has split his soul into other, hidden portions and Harry will have to find and destroy each soul.

3276151,1,B000ZECQ08,"Because this movie was not the Half Blood Prince by any stretch of the imagination. I have read repeated reviews giving this film 5 stars or A+ ratings and it's ridiculous. 2 stars, even 3, or a C rating I could possibly stomach, but this movie totally butchered the story. They should have just changed the title altogether and not messed up a good thing.

I think that some people feel that the book fans do not like the film because it's not exactly like the original story.  Not liking this film has nothing to do with fans of the story wanting an exact replica on the screen. Would that have been awesome?  Yes, but not expected. I have never expected the movie's to cover every detail of the books, but the important scenes should be included.  That being said, adding in unnecessary scenes that were not in the book is a waste of time. It detracted time from the end battle and the funeral that should have taken place because they are extremely significant to the story. Too much romance and not enough of the noteworthy, serious, or dark points were covered.

I did enjoy the performance of a number of the actors but I can imagine the non-book readers could have left feeling very confused by the lack of information given in this film. I think the reason these movies do so well in the theaters is the fans of the books know the story is over and the movies are nostalgic for them, despite how badly they are often handled. It is a shame that almost all the heart we grew to love from the books was lost in the film.

I could not recommend this movie to a book fan or a newcomer who hasn't read the books, neither one would be satisfied. If you only want to focus on special effects and romance then I am sure you will like the film much better than I did.",1248134400,24,1767,4.307228915662651

3276154,3,B000ZECQ08,"And that quote very neatly sums up the entire movie, HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE. And it's not the boy Wizard and his friends who carry the film on their shoulders. It's three great British actors who do more with their roles than the script ever manages to suggest: namely--JIM BROADBENT, with his hilarious quizzical expression as Professor Slughorn, ALAN RICKMAN as Snapes, seething with intensity no matter how trite his lines are, and MICHAEL GAMBON as Dumbledore, urging Harry to fight the evil forces engulfing Hogwarts.

On a much more superficial level, we have the three young stars giving their usual bland performances as students dealing with raging hormones as well as wizardry--DANIEL RADCLIFFE in his most colorless Potter role to date, EMMA WATSON and RUPERT GRINT. They do furnish the only lighter moments in a film dedicated to the dark side, complete with low-key lighting for all the interior shots and murky skies full of Death Eaters and such.

Technically, all the usual care has gone into creating the dark fantasy world of J.K. Rowling and the background score by Nicholas Hooper adds dimension to the film's many dark moods and action moments.

My impression was that very little seemed to be happening in the way of story development for the first hour-and-a-half with attention drawn more to the love potion moods of the youngsters distracted from their studies by puppy love. RUPERT GRINT, in particular, had some very amusing moments in this vein.

But the overall feeling is that this is simply going over ground already covered in previous Potter outings without any really significant new developments or feats of wizardry we expect in these sort of stories. Not having read the book, I can only say that there was a certain lack of focus on story ingredients that made me think I was missing something.

Nor was it helpful that Radcliffe, Grint and Watson did not have the clear enunciation of the above-mentioned trio of British gentlemen who really carried the film. Their diction was impeccable compared to the young stars who made their lines indistinct at times.

Final verdict: For Potter fans, I'd rate it watchable but not compelling enough to merit such huge box-office grosses",1248048000,8,2232,4.986559139784946

3276156,3,B000ZECQ08,"Agree with some earlier reviewers on too many important things being left out and other scenes that were added that never occurred in the book and did absolutely nothing for the story (Harry with waitress at beginning, burning the Burrow(!)).  While I've enjoyed the 5th movie a bit more with each viewing, and probably will for the 6th as well, I do not like this director's (same guy for the 5th and 6th movies and, unfortunately, for the remaining two films) handling of the story.  One more thing I haven't seen addressed, unless I missed it--the absolutely horrible music in the 5th and 6th movies by Nicholas Hooper (who most likely will also do the remaining two films)--completely unmemorable, bland, generic movie music, unlike the music of his two predecessors, John Williams and Patrick Doyle, who both contributed outstanding scores.  As a musician myself, I feel the score adds so much to the movie.  This guy missed the boat completely.  What a shame.",1248048000,14,965,4.895705521472393
3276157,1,B000ZECQ08,"First let me start by saying I have NOT read the books so I am not disappointed in any changes from the books. I come to this movie strictly as a movie-lover and expecting another fun Harry Potter movie. I have never been so disappointed and let down in a film where my expectations were not overly exaggerated. This movie was boring, bland, overly hormone-charged, and had hardly any substance what-so-ever. Relationships are awkward, the main three don't seem to have normal interactions, the ending is abrupt, characters randomly show up on camera and then they're gone, things are introduced oddly and seem important and then seemingly forgotten (i.e., Draco's cane and the bugs that ""make your mind fuzzy""), the feelings Harry has for Ginny seemed to have come out of nowhere since the last film and the attraction between Harry and Cho, scenes seem tossed together and the movie as a whole does not flow very well. The lack of emotion is very evident when a certain main character dies. And the way that person dies is quite abrupt and shows Harry as a huge wimp and completely unprepared for what I expect is coming in the next chapter. There are a LOT of things that are not explained in this movie and by a lot I mean I was lost left and right in this movie. I had to talk with people who have read the books to help understand what was not explained but having spoken with them they are much more disappointed than me. The differences they explained from the book to the movie is so great that even I'm questioning how they can make up for it in the final chapter and fix things that truly contradict the story. But like I said, I came to this from strictly a movie-lover's perspective and not knowing if things were changed or omitted. Even still, this is a very, very disappointing movie.

**UPDATE**
I have now read the book and must say the movie actually seems to do a very good job of the book. I was too upset to not be behind a 5-star rating that I had to read the book. Yes, many parts are left out and many really pointless things are added or changed but for the most part this movie did well in my opinion of sticking with the book.

However, I feel because of the things added, the HUGE battle left out, not explaining, at least in part, the break-up between Harry and Cho between the last movie and this one that the movie was still poorly, poorly done. Every other movie alone does well telling a story, flows well with the other movies, and does not require prior knowledge of it's audience but this one almost certainly does. This movie almost seems to have been directed by someone totally different though.

Even in the book there is not much desire to figure out who the Half-Blood Prince is so the movie was not mistaken here. Also, the book also shows a lot of ""hard feelings"" between the main three and not much interaction as a group so the movie showed that well (but doesn't explain it as well as the book [can't believe I'm saying that]). Also, the Wrackspurts, which make your brain go fuzzy, were also only mentioned in the beginning of the book so the movie isn't off here either. However, on that point, that is followed up by Luna's belief about the Auror's later at Slughorn's party which I don't remember in the movie. If it was there it would help paint a better picture of Luna's character and beliefs but if it wasn't then the part about the Wrackspurts seems pointless still.

The funeral, perhaps can be used to start the next movie off in a sad, sombering way to help set things up as it appears there will be no time at Hogwarts and things will start soon after the ending we just saw. Disappointing to not see, but okay with me for now.

So, I no longer believe we are in trouble when it comes to the next films because I do not see how things are too immeasurable to overcome. HOWEVER, unlike the previous movies or any other sequel of any sort that I've seen, this movie is still mostly boring, mostly anti-climactic, confusing from the previous movie (Harry and Cho relationship mostly), and just filled with too much fluff. There's bound to be changes from the book, but there were too many unneccessary additions. Not only did it drag this out (which no doubt adds to the bored sensation), it added to confusion to the audience as to the purpose (i.e., the waitress in the beginning, Draco's cane, and the multiple times we see Draco at the closet).

I would love to increase my star rating, but like I said before, as a pure movie-lover's take on this, this was not higher than a low 3-star movie. But, I will still purchase the movie on DVD when it comes out to continue my collection and hope that it grows on me.",1248048000,31,4673,4.434225844004657
3276158,3,B000ZECQ08,"I have a confession to make: I am 40-something years old, and I love the Harry Potter series. Well, not much of a confession, is it? In fact, as I looked around in the theater arena at the other patrons of this newly-released ""young adult"" blockbuster film, I noticed that the vast majority of them were at least my age and many older than me. And they did NOT have children with them. This alone speaks to the universality of theme that I had recognized myself long ago within the pages of this compelling story. It isn't just for children after all. Beyond any questions of the red herring of ""witchcraft,"" I have found this series to contain quintessential good vs. evil struggles that are presented in realistic fashion, that is, that the players are human (well, roughly anyway) and everyone has deep motivation and logic behind his or her actions. The tale is an expertly woven one. In the book, that is.

I am lucky that I went into the viewing of this film having read the book first, although it has been a few years since I picked it up. Amazingly, the plot points and fabric floated back to me as if I had only just read it. After all, the Half-Blood Prince is my favorite character and this 6th volume my favorite book in the series.  So, why then is there only a tentative thread of curiosity into who the Half-Blood Prince is? I found the dramatic intensity of the books' scenes dampened here and in other ways. I have heard other reviewers call the film ""leisurely"" and harp about all the snogging that goes on. Sure, there is snogging in the book, but there is so much more. I figure we could have done with some of the backstory of the Prince's early life to tie the reminscences of Horace Slughorn for his star pupil Lily Evans together in a suggestive way that would give us more insight into what was going on. Perhaps cut off one of the many, MANY shots of Malfoy looking serious, Malfoy looking worried, Malfoy looking distraught...well, you get the idea.

For all that, I found the snogging scenes pretty well done and Lavender Brown suitably overblown and awful, complete with her purring of ""Won Won"" to a horrified Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint played the man in the lovers' snare to perfection here). Hermione, too, was real ""heart on your sleeve"" when it came to the lovers' game as well and her unwanted suitor McClaggen was pretty good, but I think Lavender takes the cake. Both Grint and Watson were the picture of young, complicated, emotional ""love."") Radcliffe's Potter, however, seemed rather preoccupied and I got none of the feeling that he wanted to pummel Ginny's suitors into the earth as noted in the book. I can see, however, why this is downplayed, since Harry has so much more to worry about. Potter stands upon a knife-edge at this point, and I think Radcliffe played it passing well, coming off as somewhat overwhelmed but well over his own adolescent sufferings as seen in ""Order of the Phoenix.""

Many of the plot points were condensed or modified to tell a leaner story; for instance, Malfoy's grand scheme with the vanishing cabinets entails a mass invasion by many Death Eaters in the book. All the Order of the Phoenix members are fighting in the halls and up the stairs to the Astronomy Tower. In the movie, there are only four people, and it is a quiet, personal affair. No one knows what happened until it is all over. The denouement in the Astronomy Tower seems somehow constricted, like it is even physically blocked by the set itself without the clear, circular space from the book; the good, weakened, facing the bad, in great numbers, waiting for Malfoy to perform. Only when Snape steps in finally does the scene converge with memory. Overall, I got the feeling of an ill-blocked scene, as Harry was completely out of the place I envisioned from the setup in the book. In print it was compelling, thrilling, with the Dark Mark over Hogwarts seen from Hogsmeade, urging our heroes to respond to Malfoy's action. In the movie, all this is blurred and the Dark Mark appears only after all is said and done, as if it is a dramatic recapitulation rather than mad melee challenge. In the end, the quiet tone works well enough, the intimate coup, rather than the overrunning of noisy and haphazard Dark Wizards. It must have been easier to follow for those who have not read the book.

I did feel that there was not enough staff consternation and reaction to the shocking role of Professor Snape, and his final interaction with Harry was also somewhat muffled, the dramatic intensity lessened from the breathless narrative in the book. But, perhaps those of you who are aficionados of the movies without the influence of the books will find this review to be somewhat annoying (uh oh, it's another one of those ""it's not as good as the books"" reviews!). But the movie does have its own sort of internal consistency, and there are suggestive hints dropped throughout that will mean something to those who have read the books but will pass unnoticed to those who haven't.

For instance, after Harry drinks the Felix Felicis potion and goes out the Gryffindor House portal to find Professor Slughorn, he says ""Hi!"" to someone he must have run into. In the book, Harry has bumped between Ginny and Dean Thomas and precipitated the breakup fight that will magically free up Ginny to become HIS girl in the end. Felicity, indeed! But that can't be told in a movie the way it can be told in print. Slughorn's recruitment by Dumbledore and Harry is also diluted by throwing out Harry's show of persuasive power for a less compelling motivation (""he wants to collect you, Harry"".) Another is the very short appearance of Regulus Black (his photo, anyway), Sirius' brother, in a picture of Slughorn's that he is showing to Harry at the beginning. ""I'd have liked to have the set,"" he opines. What this means is lost on the audience, unless they know that Slughorn was the Master of Slytherin House in his days at Hogwarts, and he ""had"" Regulus but didn't have Sirius. This is because Sirius is in Gryffindor House, which might explain his Gryffindor friends, mightn't it? And watch for more on Regulus later, in the next thrilling installment.

Anyway, overall, I found the movie enjoyable, except that, of course, it didn't focus quite so much on the second titular character. I did find enough to keep it together though; the underflow text that begins with Snape's vow with Narcissa and Bellatrix at the beginning is suggested throughout, even if it is often with one of rather too many meaningful glam shots of Malfoy looking put out. (Speaking of Malfoy, it looks as if Tom Felton has grown up rather too quickly; Malfoy looks like a cutthroat corporate exec already. I guess we could put it down to the stresses placed on him in this story. After all, this is really the first time the younger Malfoy gets to be part of the real meat of the story. (The elder Malfoy is only seen in various newspaper clippings that suggest not only disgrace but incarceration and general disfavor. Bad luck, Lucius!) Another shady, unexplained character is Fenrir Grayback, who is seen with Malfoy and Bellatrix several times and is part of the invading party, but somehow we're never let in on the fact that he's a werewolf, and what's more, that he's the very one who turned Remus Lupin into a werewolf when he was but 5 years old. And to top it all off, he's rather ""into"" turning young kids into werewolves. That would have added quite a lot of tension and thrill to the scene where he is pursuing Harry and Ginny outside the Weasley House (which I don't recall having burned down in the book.) One thing that seems to have fallen out ok, though, is the sense that Voldemort is everywhere but here. We are shown young Tom Riddle, whose portrayal by two young actors at different ages comes off as polite evil about to hatch out well enough. The shots of the ring on young Tom's hand and then in Dumbledore's office later is suggestive enough, but these books are becoming more complex as we reach the denouement, and I hardly think a single movie of just over 2-1/2 hours can encompass it all. It is no wonder the last installment has been split into two, or else it might end up as a series of blip images that mean something only to people like me who have devoured the books a few times each.

Ok, so this isn't a tidy review, but perhaps you get the idea from it that it is a passably good film that has tidbits hidden in it that are only revealed properly if you've read the books. I must end up saying yes, the book is better than the movie, but, in the end, this is a feature of the medium. Books have all the time in the world to tell a detailed story, and the quickness of its telling is determined only by how fast you wish to turn the pages. I grow more and more to feel that the Harry Potter series is diminished if one only knows the films but they are still quite enjoyable as far as summer blockbusters go. Just prepare to be confused by many of the unexplained images and stuff that was left out in the translation of book to film.",1247961600,15,9080,4.556031843233313
3276159,2,B000ZECQ08,"They left too much out. Period. And their editing sucks because movies aren't supposed to *feel* too long. I haven't read the book and I watched this thing drag on and on and felt bored. Bored! There is this incredible world of magic, brought to life with dazzling special effects, great costumes, compelling characters and actors with genuine chemistry. And so yeah there IS that! So thumbs-up on all that! But it was like watching half of a story unfold with crucial information and contexts edited out to make room for teenage drama. It is exactly like hearing a great story but you missed a few crucial parts and so it falls flat, and the person telling the story isn't a great story teller...And it reminds of somebody who is, in this case of Harry Potter, Alfonso Cuarn who made the most cinematic film of the series. Yes the movie version must necessarily leave out somethings, but it is the job of the writer and director to get what is essential in there while not bogging things heavily down too much. Since David Yates was chosen to do the last book, I hold out little hope, but at least they did the smart thing, giving that book two movies. Maybe that will save the day?
I guess they think everybody has read the books, but that seems like it would make it worse for those that have. You know every detail that skipped!

I really have enjoyed the *film* series. I'm not a reader of the books, which undoubtedly strikes you as absurd and wrong (so I'm already aware you probably strongly feel that way, so spare me. I do read books.)
The director and screen writers have dragged this adventure series down and zapped it of it's excitement. It is NOT because the books are darker. If anything ""darker"" should mean better.",1247961600,6,1732,4.533546325878595
3276160,3,B000ZECQ08,"And so we all go now, like zombies drawn to raw flesh, or lemmings to the sea, to watch this latest intallment of the Harry Potter Franchise.

So, why do people go in droves to see the Harry Potter movies?  Well, clearly I belong to the category of adults who have never read the books and were drawn in by their children, who did read the books.

And at the end of it all, the only things that are clear to me about the success of the Harry Potter books and movies are:

1. Their fascination for pre-pubescent children has always been in the fact that this is a tale of children, empowered by magic and living in a fantastical world, and able to show their stuff and prove their worth to the adults around them.

2. The series mixes a complex fantasy world with brief interactions with the real world.  Which does create some gigantic plot holes, but it is also, I think one of the attractions of the movie series - that these are modern day British children and teenagers, easy to relate to, and living halfway in the real world, and halfway in this fantasy world.

3. Somehow or another, ""Harry Potter"" managed to stand out enough from the crowd initially to become a Big Success as a book with its core audience of pre-pubescent children.  As everybody piled on top of this success, the first movie ""Sorcerer's Stone"" (""Philosopher's Stone"" outside of the U.S.) also became a resounding success.  Key to this was the casting and the careful shepharding of the storyline, and careful craftsmanship of the movie itself.  Turning a children's fantasy story into a movie goldmine is hardly automatic -as ""Golden Compass"" and ""Inkheart"" have shown.

For me, one of the most pleasant aspects of slogging through all of these Harry Potter movies has been following the growth of the real-life actors and actresses on screen.  I think that this has been one of the main reasons for the success of Harry Potter the Franchise - the initial selection of such a group of healthy, wholesome, and really neat kids to play these characters.  Their natural likeability and talent has always come right out onto the screen, which has not been the case for other child actors (e.g., Jake Lloyd -young Anakin Skywalker, Dakota Richards - ""Golden Compass"").

One wonders what would have happened if Terry Gilliam had been made the director of the first Harry Potter movie (as J.K. Rowling wanted), if the movie series would have developed a more sly and twisted sensibility than what it has become.  I would have loved to see that.

For the movie series has evolved into a well-crafted but ponderous vehicle for decent entertainment.  The book series that it draws from was never as well constructed or well written as a fantasy world in the class of Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"".  And thus the movies reveal their uneven, plot-holed origins from the book.

This particular movie especially required a guidebook, as in nearly every scene, stuff just happened that was never explained.  Of all the Harry Potter movies, this one had the least amount of exposition to it, a pity, since this section deals with the Origin of Voldemort.  I had my daughter with me, who helped explain parts of the movie.

Viewers without a guide, who have never watched a previous Potter movie, and who have never read the book series, would almost certainly be left  completely clueless by the goings on in this movie.",1247961600,6,3382,4.685279187817259
3276161,4,B000ZECQ08,"Briefly, this latest rendition of the Harry Potter saga was quite well done, an above average of the series and could possibly be the best so far.

Not only was it a darker, richer story, but the scriptwriters were surgically precise in cutting out of Rowling's book all the fat and leaving the meat.

They cut out the Dursely's (SP), which is fine with me. Off with the Minister of Magic, including Fudge and his replacement. Away with many of the Tom Riddle memories that were expounded in the book. No Snape detention sentences. No Dobby!

And that's OK. What was left?

Teenage angst in the form of loves lost, loves gained and love POTION! The film concentrated on personalities for the most part and the fun and excitement of Quidditch (kinda like wizard soccer).

The acting was not overdone, but in many ways subdued with was a point of contention with me. Also the ending was much subdued than the book. The book's exciting battle of Hogwarts and the confrontation with Snape and Harry were extremely suppressed to a minor ten minutes. Damn few wizard battles though the attack on London by the dark wizards was fascinating.

The Pensieve and the whole memories smoke thing was intriguing but new viewers who have not read the books may not totally follow.

We're rooting for Harry, Slughorn and wondering about who the Half-Blood Prince is (which revelation was much better done in the book). A character dies, a chapter closes, and hints for the next segment make you want more.

And the soundtrack score at the credits is to die for.

Highly Recommended.

3276163,3,B000ZECQ08,"I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter series and I think they have done a great job with the movies so far, however I always think the book version is better than any movie version.  I went to see this with two people who had not read the book so I was interested to see how well were able to understand what was going on without the background.  I also re-read the book a couple of weeks ago to refresh my own memory.

A few observations:

- I was disappointed that they started the movie off with a scene that never happened in the book; Harry in a cafe.
- I had been waiting to see how they handled the meeting and conversation between the Muggle prime minister and the minister of Magic but they skipped that part completely.
- the movie Harry never really mentioned Dumbledore's hand and neither did anyone else for that matter.  In the book it was a matter of gossip among all of the students.
- they skipped the first memory that explained Tom Riddle's witch mother and muggle father, how poor and proud they were and the significance of the both the ring and the locket.
- they skipped later memories that explained how Tom Riddle ended up with the ring and the locket.
- Bill and Fleur were both completely missing
- Dobby and Kreacher were both completely missing
- The battle at Hogwarts when the Death Eaters came in was missing
- they left out the whole funeral scene where everyone came to see Dumbledore off; even the mermaid people showed their respect.
- I have no idea why they stuck in the scene where Harry and Ginny were running through the cornfield and Bella burned the Burrows.  That did not happen in the book; in fact the Burrows was well protected.

To me these are some of the important scenes that were left out.  My friends had a hard time understanding what was going on.  I am glad I re read the book recently or I might have had a bit of trouble following it since they seemed to leave so much out.

On the other hand the special effects were great and I have to give credit, coming up with all of the creative things that JK Rowling comes up with for the books has got to be a challenge.

I think the actors all did a pretty good job.  The actor playing Malfoy did a fine job of showing his angst about the job he had to do however the whole story about the two vanishing cabinets being connected was fuzzy.  They did a great job on the scene where Harry finally got the memory from Slughorn but then they followed it pretty closely from the book.  I loved how positive and upbeat Harry was after he had drank the liquid luck.

I gave this three stars because they left so much that was vital out and added a couple of things that were completely unnecessary.  There was much to like however.  I think this movie would have been better if they had made it in two parts as they are planning to do with the last one.  Books 5, 6 & 7 just have so much information that one 2 hour+ movie simply cannot do them justice.",1247875200,31,2946,4.221033868092691
3276164,4,B000ZECQ08,"The sixth installment in the Harry Potter film series, HALF-BLOOD PRINCE, has its moments.  Indeed, there are twists and turns and plenty of romance galore that are threefold.  Consisting first and foremost, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) continues his wizardly quest for good over evil despite the ever-menacing spirit of Lord Voldemort, which left movie viewer's gasping during the ORDER OF THE PHOENIX, second, Harry as possible candidate under the tutelage of Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon)to become his successor, and third, the hyper-sensitive hormones that Harry and his peers, Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) simply cannot escape as part of their stage of adolescence.

The film appears much darker than the previous two and breaths similarities to the cinematography of a LORD OF THE RINGS or Tim Burton film and other epic renderings that have had a medieval-like quality depicting heroism and myth.  With that in mind, there are high and low points of the film that avid Harry Potter movie fans may notice.  Indeed, the lighter moments are exhibited with the giggly somewhat sappy scenes that show new Hogwart's Professor Horace Slughorn concocting magical love potions that get the wizards abuzz.  Ron experiences his first romantic encounter with Gryffindor student, Lavender Brown (Jesse Cave) while at the same time Hermione appears to have a crush on Ron that has her feeling a little left out; Harry is also game with Ron's sister, Ginney (Bonney Wright).  But there are scenes and characters in the film that simply did not have enough of an impact and attempted to put a bit of a punch within the film, such as the conflicting scenes with Professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) and Harry as well as the presence of femme fatale Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham) who looked like something out of Edward Scissorhands with her gothic persona, and the mystery surrounding the Half-Blood Prince and looming suspicions of Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton).  But film-goers will no doubt be looking for the concluding climax of the film that did not appear unpredictable, especially for readers.

For the most part, HALF-BLOOD PRINCE was highly entertaining and clich.  Harry Potter fans will flock to see the film as they see the intensity of the scenes but may also leave one either empty handed or hungry for the next installment.  The film is indeed filled with a mix of emotions and love potions thus earning 3.5 stars.",1247875200,2,2445,5.102756892230577
3276165,5,B000ZECQ08,"Just watched the newest screening. It's amazing. The art direction is stellar, and the story is executed very well. The love stories are nicely fit in. the action is extremely good, though the action in Goblet of Fire is yet to beaten.
Daniel Radcliffe has improved very much, and is not the douche bag he was in ORDER OF THE PHOENIX. In fact, he is the heart if the film. Micheal Gambon is the DUMBLEDORE we wanted in this film. Grint as RON is amazing, and we get to see how he gets rid of his predicament-in the form of Lavender Brown- amusingly. Emma Watson is better than Grint, and her performance is top-notch. She's also extremely gorgeous (I'm 15, I'm allowed to say that).
But the real scene-stealer is Rickman as Snape. He's awesome, and no one else can be Snape. This is MR. Alan's breakthrough performance.
The rest of the actors are magnificent, while Helena B. Carter and Maggie Smith shine. The only complaint is the girl who plays Lavender Brown. She plays her finely, but I hate her character. I guess she did a good job, then.
Bonnie Wright is really good (in acting, she needs to look better like Emma).
The art direction and effects are, as always, incredible.

3276166,2,B000ZECQ08,"Here, Potter is shut in a darkened room and tortured by boredom until his backside went to sleep and went painfully numb. Hold on a second, no, that was me. Hells bloody bells, having never read the books and seeing all of the films, this is bogging down into a battle of attrition, much like when the X-Files stopped being good and you just had to force yourself to watch it in case something happened. Well, don't worry, nothing did. Oh, some bloke called Stumblebum fell off a big tower and was possibly killed. Or not Wooohooo. My wife who has read the books tells me he was killed. Ho hum. So, ask yourself this.

1) How is the staff at Hogwarts, apparently the hand picked SAS of magic, totally incompetent and always beholden to incompetent students to get them out of the mire.

2) How come Harry Potter, seemingly the ""Ronaldo"" of magic, always gets his arse kicked by every junior wizard, warlock, witch, etc etc he ever comes across. If he is the best the forces of good have to offer, then we are Royaly boogered.

3) How come Stumblebum always starts off with the line ""Harry, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to do something incredibly dangerous etc etc etc"", why doesn't Potter say, ""Booger off, I'm sick of having to clear up your mess, why don't you grow some and sort it out yourself for a change, why on earth has Hogwarts not burned to the ground with an incompetent fool like you in charge, I will never know.""

4) How come when death and disaster reaches out to Hogwarts, the best civil defence planning they can muster is to send everyone to bed? Dame Maggie Smith says in a faux Jocko accent like that women off the Flash adverts years ago, ""Ooch aye children, North Korea has launched a 100 megaton nuclear strike against Hogwarts, noo, please children off to the dormitories with ye before ye warheads vaporize you all, the staff will light a scented candle and hope for the best while Potter sorts it out we hope""..

3276167,4,B000ZECQ08,"|The 8-Month Wait|
At first, when I heard back in November of last year that Harry Potter's 6th chapter would be postponed for 8 months, I was furious.  I blamed Warner Bros for being greedy and wanting more money. 'Shame on them', I thought, for making fans of the movies wait another 8 months... just so they can get a profit.  And, especially, 'shame', for toying with fans of the books, who want to see their favorite story come to life on the screen - especially now that Rowling has finished the Potter tale in such fine form.

As time went by, I changed my mind.  Warner Bros expressed their deep desire to please the fans, and illustrated this by keeping interests peaked and hunger abated using clips from the movie, and photographs from the set of the 'now-in-production 7th Potter movie'.  I reasoned more time meant more opportunities to tweak/improve the sixth film, and make sure patient fans won't be disappointed come July 15th.

|The First Impression|
I've finally seen the film... twice, as of today.  The first time I saw it, I was dismayed. 'Fans of the films might be shocked', I thought, 'that was such a DARK film... gloomy, a drastic shift in the tone for the movie series.  How will movie-fans adjust to this?  And Fans of the books', I feared, 'would be disappointed.  No...not disappointed, FURIOUS!!! Where are the funny scenes with Fudge and the British Prime Minister? Or a heartbroken Tonks and her brown hair and dog-shaped Patronus?  Where are the remaining flashbacks of Voldemort's parents, or his murderous acts as a child, and then as an adult? Or his chilling, almost casual conversation with Dumbledore, man to man?  And what, WHAT happened to the violent duel between the Death Eaters and the Order of the Phoenix?!?  That tense prelude to the tragic climax at the end of the sixth book?!? And WHERE is the FUNERAL scene?!?'

All these thoughts rushed through my mind after seeing the film the first time.  But then, fan of the Potter story that I am, I began to think:  The director for the sixth film, the cast, AND the producer of HP6 ALL gushed about how proud they were of the finished film, and how much they desired to please fans of both the books AND the movies with their work... were they LYING?  Why say all those things, and then show us a film so different from what any fan of the movies OR books would expect?  I decided to give the film a second look, and tried to view it from a different perspective - not as a movie fan, OR as a book fan, but as a critic - a lover of good movies in general.

|A Parting of the Ways|
The result? Satisfaction from every angle. A 2nd viewing of the film gave me a new found respect for David Yates and the work he has done to elevate the quality of the Potter franchise, and please fans and casual viewers alike.  Yes, this Potter is DARK.  Darker I'd say that the last one, and that was a pretty gloomy viewing as well.  But the Potter story was always supposed to BE darker as Harry got older.  Fans of the books will recall the initial shock they felt at Cedric Diggory's death in Book 4, and the horror of 'Flesh, Blood, and Bone', the chapter which chronicled Voldemort's awful return in gruesome detail.  Many readers closed the 4th Potter book with the stunned realization that evil had just successfully come back into the world, and that the fate of the Wizarding world as we know it, was uncertain.  That shock, more than anything, is what kept us reading through Books 5, 6, and 7. This unexpected twist is what Rowling kept utilizing in her books to keep readers on edge - not knowing what could possibly happen next to Harry and his friends that could make things any more worse for the Wizarding world.

Yates has made this intention clear with this film.  Potter's world is NOT the same anymore. No one is safe any longer, and evil has returned and will strike at any time. The sixth book did not feel as ominous and foreboding as the film, but that is the book - I got to see more of Harry's life outside of the menace of Voldemort, a luxury of insight a 3 hour film can only allow so much of.  And Yates does in fact incorporate some of those joyous moments in this film as well, but he makes the viewer aware those joyful moments will be short and sparse, as something terrible is happening in Potter's world, or is about to happen at any moment.  The movie fans must adjust to this change in tone, just as the fans of the books had to adjust from the 4th book up until Book 7 (which incidentally, feels much, MUCH darker in tone than Book 6, for various, necessary reasons.)

And as for fans of the books?  Well, after a 2nd viewing of this film, I feel this sixth movie is sort of like a 'Parting of the Ways' between the book and film versions of Harry Potter.  Rowling has finished the books and ended the story well. Now Yates knows how the story will end, and - since he will be directing all the remaining movies - has complete control over all the elements of Potter's journey that will lead us to the fateful climax in book 7.  Thus, he can now adjust the flow of the story at will, and tweak its development such that fans still get a visual experience of Harry Potter's world, without casual viewers and critics alike being compromised of an entertaining, intriguing film. If Yates simply continued to recreate what fans read in the sixth book, fans of the book would watch the sixth movie and probably be satisfied, but the movie itself, might be too fragmented in its storytelling, and would probably feel too long for casual viewers.  Yates could have aimed more for movie fans and simplified the sixth book's story so they didn't have to work too hard to figure out hints and clues, but Yates doesn't do that either.  Instead, he carefully balances the amount of back-story included in this film... enough to intrigue and entertain viewers without compromising their need to think about what they are seeing.  This is similar to Rowling's style of storytelling.  As fun as it was in each book to 'come back to Hogwarts with Harry', the pleasure of seeing how characters, hints, and clues fit together, how they led to shocking, exciting revelations, added to the experience of each book and always left me eager to read the next book in the Potter saga.

|The Future of Potter|
In a nutshell? A 'Parting of the Ways' - no more sticking too closely to the books, and no more simplifying too much of what's on the screen for casual viewers - in fact, the Critics might just be the new fans to please.  Not an easy pill to swallow (I myself am still adjusting to the taste), but it speaks a lot about Yates' intentions for the Potter movie franchise.  He wants to end the Potter story with a bang, and do it with style, efficiency, and substance.  As someone who loves Rowling's books and knows how a good film can inspire a person to read more literature (Lord of the Rings, I am looking your way), I commend Yates, AND the actors, AND Warner Bros, for their work with this 6th Harry Potter film.  It's a work of art and storytelling, fun and fantasy, dark horror, love, loss, and sadness.  I trusted Rowling to do justice to the Potter story and bring Harry Potter's tale to an exciting and mind-warping conclusion.  She exceeded my expectations.  I think, when all the movies are done and there is nothing left to do but look back, Yates will have done the same for the Potter film franchise, elevating the visualization of the Potter stories into something more substantial, more meaningful to behold, and creating new fans of the movies and books alike.",1247875200,10,7580,4.4847161572052405
3276168,4,B000ZECQ08,"I have enjoyed all six Harry Potter films, but this one ranks among the  very best in my opinion. There wasn't nearly as much action as I expected and I heard that some major scenes were cut (the final battle and a funeral being the major ones), but the characters and story had me captivated for the nearly 2 and 1/2 hour running time. The CGI was convincing and the music score was much better than expected, though I do miss what John Williams did with the first three movies. They should have at least used his epic theme more than the few seconds at the start. There was also plenty of humor to help balance the mood of the film, because this Potter film is very dark.

All the young actors have gotten better and better with each passing movie. I really enjoyed the addition of the new teacher played brilliantly by Jim Broadbent. He made for quite a fascinating character.  It was also a treat to see more of the great Alan Rickman as Snape, but sadly many characters from previous movies are only given a few lines. At least they have kept all the same actors over the years, no matter how small the role.

Overall, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is one of the better films I've seen this year and is worth the time of anyone, no matter your age. Now I'm really looking forward to the two part finale due out in 2010 and 2011.",1247875200,6,1342,4.313492063492063
3276169,2,B000ZECQ08,"JR reviewer gets it right. As adult fans of both HP books and movies this one just missed it by miles. I think we all need to chant loud enough together to shake the earth under Warner's feet....""WE WANT THE BATTLE>>>>WE WANT THE FUNERAL>>>>WE WANT A WEE BIT MORE ACCURACY to the book. But insulting the fans by not including the great battle at the end closer to the books rendition was most unkind. Not just unthoughtful but down right mean and cruel. I was upset many years ago after Chris Columbus first assured he would make all 7 movies and stay as close to the books as was reasonable.... his ""all actors have to be UK born"" rhetoric& promises to both JKR and...the world viewers. Yet when most are 8-12 year olds and as adult fans we too could care less about the MOVIE BIZ perse which CC was really concerned and posturing to back then. But then what happened....by Movie 3...CC was bored stiff and wanted out & somehow he was allowed to distance himself....so what does CC make of this mess. I would like to see JK Rowling herself step up if she has anything to say these days about the let down of this movie to her fans. And also please Ms. Rowling....please if you have influence rights still make sure the next so called two movie episodes will be done to honor the viewers and readers and all YOUR fans alike...do it right Warners. This missed by a mile. What happened? Warner insulted not just the fans of course but Rowling herself.  I debated on giving it only a 1 star. But there were some redeeming parts. The responsible people behind this sad cut needs to be kicked to the curve. Make the movie longer to tell it right if you need to...kids and adult fans alike would agree. Anyone up for a remake of this one? Send your votes to Warners!",1247875200,16,1760,4.382262996941896
3276170,4,B000ZECQ08,"I never thought I would be disappointed by ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" movie adaptation. My expectations were not high. The book is so great it is simply impossible to spoil the movie. Alas, I was mistaken.

It was surprising how unbalanced the plot was. Seems like too much emphasis was put on the romantic relationships. So much so that we completely lost touch with the main theme of battle of good vs evil. Don't get me wrong, I loved Ron/Hermione/Lavender and Harry/Ginny scenes in the book. But in the movie these scenes overshadowed the main event - Dumbledore's death and Snape's seeming betrayal. I remember crying over this scene while reading the book, I remember despising Snape. No luck here. The crucial scenes went by in the movie so fast that I didn't have a chance to feel anything for anybody. At all.

The love between Harry and Ginny never blossomed, there was no chemistry between the actors unfortunately. Slughorn came off as an old whimp. Where was the Order, where were Death Eaters, where was Voldemort? Forget it, instead we got endless fluffy teenage romance scenes.

The only redeeming scenes in the movie belonged to Draco. I felt his moments, although never written, were brilliant. I thought he totally stole this movie.

Overall, the movie was just too light, too long, too anti-climatic and yes, even boring at times. Where were the darkness, the tragedy, the feeling of an impending doom? Sadly, gone...

I would certainly recommend watching this movie, even just for glorious visuals effects. But ultimately, this movie was a disappointment.",1247788800,10,1590,4.962406015037594
3276171,2,B000ZECQ08,"ALAS! After two years of waiting for the sixth installment of the H.P. series, the Warner Corporation presents us with a lame, unsatisfying, boring and highly dissapointing movie. I second all the previous reviews, like the one from J.R. among others, who have appropriately pinpointed the flaws in this ghastly film.  Come on!!  They totally left out (or changed) crucial parts of the book, like the war in Hogwarts against the Death Eaters, Dumbledore's funeral, vital info about the Horcruxes, Tom Riddle's past, etc, etc, etc.  Never mind, I will not repeat what others have already described in such an accurate way about the reasons why I shall only rate this movie with two stars. How frustrating and dissapointing, indeed! They've shattered all my healthy expectations about it. I expected  much better from this film, after all, it is supposed to be based on the excellent written version of the Half Blood Prince.",1247788800,17,923,5.0130718954248366
3276172,4,B000ZECQ08,"As is typical and probably necessary in this day and age of film making, the special effects and CGI are characters in and of themselves in this terrific, but oddly unsatisfying sixth installment in the 'Harry Potter' series.  I enjoyed it immensely, particularly the superb direction, editing, cinematography and musical score.  It was a joy watching the youthful actors make that leap from kidhood to near adulthood, and with those physical changes, the growth in their acting skills.  Ron, Hermoine, Ginny and most particularly, that villain in the wings, Draco, owing to the greater emotional demands of their characters created by J. K. Rowling, brought the necessary acting skills to their near-adult roles.  Tom Felton, for a notable example, was so much more than the snarling, spoiled, petulant antagonist he was in the previous five movies--here he was clearly committed to the nefarious task towards which he had been inculcated and now ordered to commit and yet conflicted and afraid.  Kudos to him and to the screenplay for providing him with some cinematic meat to chew on.

One wonders why, however, essential parts of the book were left either on the cutting room floor or out of the script entirely.  As long as we dive with Harry into the 'penseive,' why not let us see the growth of young Tom Riddle as he becomes Lord Voldemort?  Or the history of Severus Snape?  Of course, a book is not a film is not a book, ad infinitum, and decisions must be made to bring a movie to acceptable and budgetary length.  But in this case, less teenage durm and strang about burgeoining sexuality (as much fun as that was to watch and from which some gentle humor was derived) and more on the depth of the major motives in this plot line would have been greately appreciated.

I am not a little distressed about the director's permitting such rapid speech.  It may be British to swallow syllables, but in a film where dialogue is meant to convey character, it seems to me to be fairly essential that the words be clearly enunciated to be clearly understood.  But that is a distraction, not a glaring fault.

In terms of cinema qua cinema, plot exclusions aside, this was a wonderful movie.  The director's eye is unerringly 'spot-on,' as the Brits would say.  For example, there is a brief scene terrific scene in which Harry is seemingly alone in a long hallway, but the camera spots Draco Malfoy (let's head back to Marlowe's 'Faery Queen' for such names: it means 'bad faith) half hidden by a column, watching and listening, unknown to Harry.  The suggestion, of course, is clear that Harry is under hidden threat and potential danger.  We are given a glimpse into potential action that the main character is not.  Moreover, Draco is quite alone, not parenthesized by his duo of sycophantic bullies.  As the movie evinces clearly enough, Draco has uniquely been selected to carry out Voldemort's orders and in these few seconds, the camera suggests his capacity for genuine evil on the one hand and solitude on the other.

So, the kids are grown and are venturing into grown-up worlds of darkness merely presaged by the five earlier stories.  Rowling's wonderful manipulation of her story lines make for a thrilling sixth episode.  You will enjoy the movie, I am sure, but the die-hard Potter fans will want more.  The real key to the film as it was for the novels is the affection we are drawn to feel for the triumvirate of main characters and their fellows.  'Half Blood Prince' continues to encourage those affections by giving the characters more human substance, foible, and inner strength.  They are not witches and wizards, they are the stuff that reality is made of behind the facade of supernatural shananigan and circumstance.

In fine, can 'Deathly Hallows' (both parts!) be all that far away, where, one hopes, the poignant funeral of Albus Dumbledore would be inserted.  At least we won't have to wait as long between first screenings as we did between 'Phoenix' and 'Prince.'  Will November 2010 come soon enough?  For most Potter fans, based on this latest filmic endeavor into the non-muggle world, probably not.",1247788800,4,4136,4.833806818181818
3276173,4,B000ZECQ08,"Because I've been a fan of various stories, and know that a serious effort at including every detail in a two or three hour movie is impossible, I sat back to enjoy HP and the HBP. I wasn't disappointed. But I've read all the books at least five times. My wife hasn't read them, at all. I filled in a few items for her, which worked out, well. One thing that I did appreciate was the humanization of the characters. One minor flaw that should have been avoided was when Dumbledore and Harry disapparated from inside Hogwarts. This is a direct inconsistency in the oft mentioned ban of apparation inside Hogwarts(which was the whole point regarding the cabinets in the Room of Requirement and Borgin and Burkes.) I'll buy the DVD and watch it many times, I'm sure. Now, when are the other two being released?",1247788800,5,807,4.534246575342466
3276174,5,B000ZECQ08,"Since I have never seen a Harry Potter film before, nor read any of the books, I had to agree with Harry Potter when he said to Albus Dumbledore: ""...after all these years I just sort of go with it."" I have four nieces and they are all followers of the Potter phenomenon. They had t-shirts made with their own Potter references and slogans, and wore them to the midnight show opening. One of them went down to wait in line at 6 PM so that we could all get good seats. She was the most passionate Potterite among them and had been interviewed at past openings by the local news wearing a Hogwarts uniform.

So it was that I found myself at a midnight show. The crowd was very excited to see the opening, and I was swept up in the excitement, even though I didn't have a clue about the finer points of the J.K. Rowling story. You could say that it wasn't my bailiwick, and I was eminently unqualified to review this movie, but nevertheless, I came, I saw, and I can't resist weighing in with my two cents..

My first observation was that the audience was mostly the same age as the actors playing Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright), Lavender Brown (Jessie Cave), and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), so they had been growing up with them, and were kind of in sync. They were ALL young and feeling love's keen sting, as Professor Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) so aptly put it. In fact there was so much snogging going on, it was hard to fit in the horcruxes, Death Eaters, and the Quidditch match. I would not be surprised at all if the climax of the entire series revolves around who took who to the Hogswart prom. In fact, if I am not mistaken, there was some kind of prom or dance in Half-blood Prince, and Harry asked the most unlikely of dates, Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch) to attend.

While we are on the subject, according to my sister the relationship between Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger was much better established in the book. She had more motivation for liking Ron in the book, but on screen, we're not buying it. Why aren't Harry Potter and Hermione Granger getting together? Actually, Emma Watson is out of BOTH Harry and Ron's league. They are like the chubby fanboy who tried to give Megan Fox the yellow rose and was completely ignored. She is like the girl next door who overnight morphs into a Super Model. Harry does kiss someone in the latest installment, and I would say who, but I don't want to spoil it. The kiss is a big deal, even overshadowing the death of a main character -- again, I won't say who, but we know it's not Harry Potter, although, Harry might feel a little guilt about standing by and not doing anything.

Enough, already. I am starting to ramble. The next thing I would like to talk about is the villains. Draco Malvoy (Tom Felton) makes a pretty menacing villain, with his hair so blonde it is almost white. Lord Voldemort is not seen at all, but somehow his presence was felt. Kind of think that this movie is just a set up for the movies to come. The final showdown between Harry and Voldemort. They do have scenes of Voldemort as a boy, Tom Riddle at 11, and he is played by Hero Fiennes-Tiffin. He takes that kind of creepy look that Draco has and raises it to the nth magnitude. Our young anti-hero, Hero Fiennes-Tiffin is related to Ralph Fiennes, who plays Voldemort, but he was not only cast because he resembled his Uncle Ralph, he also had that deep and dark look that hinted of the evil to come...

------------------
Harry Potter: Did you know, sir? Then?
Albus Dumbledore: Did I know that I just met the most dangerous dark wizard of all time? No.
===============================

Anyway, seeing a Harry Potter movie for the first time, it is easy to see why so many love them. I think the audience may have been split between those who want the films to be exactly like the book, and those who don't mind the film going in a different direction than the book if it could make for a better movie. J.K. Rowling has endorsed the second approach, although she would intervene if the movie veers too far away. For instance, when the script had Dumbledore remembering an episode from his past where he loved a girl, J.K. stepped in and said that could NEVER happen because... well, you'll just have to watch and find out, won't you?

There is a third group, and that is my group, the people who don't care if it follows the book or not, because they haven't read the books. Just looking at it as a movie, without any preconceptions, I would say that there are great special effects and art direction. They really create a world and inhabit it with strange creatures that look right at home. I can see that these movies make a lot of money, and they really go all out, pumping the profits back into the products. The Potter movie I saw was really a great example of movie making craft at its finest. I think the fans will like Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, even if the ending is kind of anticlimactic. It is not the final showdown, but just setting the audience up for the battles to come.

Headmaster Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) asks Harry to do a mysterious job for him, while Voldemort has apparently given Draco Malfoy a rather unsavory task.  Amid all this gloom and doom, young love has struck at Hogwarts and Harry, Ron, and Hermione are all under its spell.

I thought the book was bloated and pointless, so I wasn't surprised that the movie was just as tedious, with way too many characters appearing for just seconds doing incomprehensible things.  The much-touted teen romances seemed perfunctory and awkward (but the young people in the theatre audience seemed to enjoy it a lot).  Even though I read the book, I had no idea what was going on with Harry and Draco's assignments (which seemed to drag on and go nowhere); those who haven't read the book will no doubt be completely lost.

The film is way too choppy; most scenes are only seconds long with just  one or two lines of dialogue, then it's off to a completely unrelated scene.  Many much-loved characters (Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Neville, Hagrid, and a frail-looking Professor McGonagal) are reduced to mere walk-on parts and even the title character, sadly, gets too little screen time.  On the plus side, the star of the show, Michael Gambon finally seems likeable and Bonnie Wright (Ginny) is slightly less wooden than in the past.

But apparently warner decided the series was turning too dark and grittier and they decided to go back to their roots in this one and make it flimsier childish and stupid. The teen angst factor eclipses the magic factor which is something that ruined the movie.  I want to hear more of the backstory, more of the characters. Like Snape. Which is a character that has intrigued me since part 1. I want to hear more of Dumbledore and his relationship with Tom Riddle.

At the hidden entrance to the cave, when Dumbledore cuts his hand to spill his blood in order to open the secret passage, and Harry says he should have done it, where in Dumbledore answers with the aforementioned line, is the whole reason for the film and the book. Not just to discover Voldemorts weakness, or to try and destroy him, but for Harry to try and finally realize just how precious he is.

That is the main point of the film, and I was very glad to see it.  There were alot of changes made to the film, but changes that I felt were warrented and appropriate. We, as Harry Potter movie fans have seen the big huge epic scenes! We had Dumbledore's and Voldemort's duel at the end of Order of the Phoenix, in the same movie we had the duel between the children and the death eaters. In Goblet of Fire we had Dragons, and amazing broom flights, and in all the other films we had fantastic Quidditch games and mesmorizing magic being performed in classrooms.

What I felt the film brought focus on was the relationships of Harry and Dumbledore; Harry, Ron and Hermione; and just the children in general, because as us Potter fans know those relationships are pivotal in the last book, and therefore also in the last films.

The deletions made sense to me, the film was smaller, more self contained. It was a relationship drama, not an epic battle film, that's for ""Deathly Hallows"". We fans have the book to read for the thrill of Dumbledore's army fending off the Death Eater's, and the extra little pieces of information. This film was about finding who you are and doing so with little help from the one person you most rely on.  It was about Harry's journey into realizing what he has to do, and that he can't and ultimately couldn't have Dumbledore's help or protection to get it done.

On the film side: The kids acting has improved leaps and bounds.  Emma Watson and Tom Felton (Hermione and Draco) were both very impressive, particularly Tom as Draco especially in the bathroom sequence and in the clock tower. Rupert Grint as Ron has shown just how great of a comic actor he can be.  Daniel as Harry is phenomenal and has improved leaps and bounds since Goblet of Fire.  The stand out performances for adults were the AMAZING Michael Gambon as Dumbledore who brought tears to my eyes with his powerful and stunningly gut wrenching performance.  Jim Broadbent as Horace Slughorn the new Potions teacher was delightfully funny and also a bit sad as well with his distant and pale sadness.  Helena Bonaham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange was amazingly insane and evil in this one, loved her, and although under used, I always adore every second of time Alan Rickman's Severus Snape is on screen.

The effects were amazing as well, and unlike a few of the previous films the were in no way meant to be a spectacle, in fact most of them seemed rather in the back ground letting the characters be the main attraction.  The cave of the Horocrux sequence was impressive (the infiri were CREEPY!)  And the burning of the burrow was rather impressive even with the saddness of the scene.

The tone of the film all though the films rating was PG rather than PG-13 like Goblet and Order before it, was actually much darker, which allowed the teen romance to give a great balance and needed lift to the whole affair.  I loved the film from start to finish, it was well made, well acted, and well thought through.

I know ALOT of people will fuss at my lack of caring that alot of stuff was changed or that things were added or omitted, I simple feel that the film worked well as a character piece about love and loss, and what is needed to take action and move on and discover your meaning; and this was the purpose of this film, in my opinion.",1247702400,8,3838,4.480631276901004
3276178,5,B000ZECQ08,"As a diehard Harry Potter fan, I really enjoyed HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE.  Yes, there are cuts and edits.  This movie has the same problem that all book-to-film conversions have:  you cannot put all of the detail into the film that a writer puts into a book.  As it is, HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE is nearly 3 hours long.  IMHO, the writers, director, and editors did the best jobs that they could, and this time they succeeded in giving us most of important plot points without making HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE into a multi-night miniseries.

Almost everyone knows or is at least familiar with the 7-book saga of Harry Potter written by J. K. Rowling, so I will not go into a detailed description here.  Suffice it to say, that with the exception of some minor edits and changes, the film is pretty true to the basic plotlines of the book.  Harry is the Chosen One; he must defeat Voldemort.  In HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE, Harry learns more about the history of Tom Riddle, why he became what he is, and what he must do to defeat him.

Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson continue to shine as they bring Harry, Ron, and Hermione to life.  It has been fun watching these kids and their characters change and grow.  This trio has done an unparalleled job in bringing these internationally beloved characters to life...their casting 9 years ago was farsighted and inspired.  They ARE Harry, Ron, and Hermione - exactly as I always imagined them to be.  Of course everyone in the Harry Potter films has become the personification of their characters.  From Dumbledore to Snape, McGonagall to Mrs. Weasley, Hagrid to Filch, Luna to Neville, and Draco to Riddle, these outstanding performers have created a very special and unique world, near and dear to all of our hearts.

One of the best parts of HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE was that the fun and humor are back.  This HARRY POTTER film is not as dark or bleak as the more recent films have been.  The writers and actors do a fantastic job of portraying the angst, goofiness, and raging hormones of teenaged love.  I laughed a lot watching this film, something that was sorely missed in the last film.  To quote Dumbledore, ""That was fun!""  And it was!

Of course, changes and cuts had to be made to the story to keep HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE from turning into a marathon.  While some will moan and groan over these edits, it is important to remember that all the little details, the vivid description, and needed exposition that make this world so real to us just simply cannot make the transition to the big screen.  Instead, we get color, depth, music, voices, facial expressions, body language, scenery, animals, people, and special effects to bring this world to life.  In the case of HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE, it seems to be a very successful trade off.  All the important plot points are made, and the final two films are well set up.  I am also going to hazard a guess that a few of the missing story lines from HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE will be moved into the next film, and that makes good sense to me.

Overall, HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE was fun, funny, and familiar.  The magic is back, and it certainly worked wonders on me.  HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE is MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1247702400,6,3380,4.631932773109244
3276179,4,B000ZECQ08,"Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. As it compares to the other films, it was better than some but not the best. B+  Mainly because I think the changes they made to the climax weren't as good as the original material.

Unlike some fans of the books, I don't automatically think ""sacrilege!"" when material is cut from the book to make the film. Mostly I agree. I think the storyline with Hagrid and his giant brother from Phoenix was fluff in the book and so not needed in the film. Occasionally I disagree. I wasn't too thrilled that they cut Hermione's clever besting of Rita Skeeter in Goblet, but could see why the filmmakers did so - that would have added more time to an already long movie. Film is a different medium for story-telling and I enjoy it on its own merits. But, the cuts/changes they made to ""Half-Blood Prince"" just didn't seem necessary to me.

I'm not talking about the majority of the film (or the fact that the title BARELY got an explanation). My criticism stems from the climactic death scene at the end. STOP HERE IF YOU DON'T ALREADY KNOW WHO DIED! In the book, Dumbledore and Harry return from their mission to find the school under attack from Death Eaters. Dumbledore's Army is holding them off, with some help from a luck potion, until the Order of the Phoenix can arrive to back them up. This was completely cut. We don't get to see the kids in action, which was a big disappointment and made the arrival of the Death Eaters an after-thought. I didn't feel any particular menace or surprise that they were in the school. Then, on top of the tower, Dumbledore has Harry hide under his invisibility cloak and then paralyzes him there. Not so in the film. Harry hides underneath the stairs and ""valiantly"" manages to restrain himself from coming to Dumbledore's aid (which doesn't jive with his character). Then, Dumbledore confronts Draco AND the Death Eaters. They weren't in this scene! I love Bellatrix's character, but it seemed they changed the scene just so she could be in it. It didn't work. Rowling's original set-up was superior. Had they kept it, this would easily have been the best HP film.

Despite this, I did enjoy the movie a lot. Prince, as the penultimate novel, was really more of staging point/set-up for the finale, so it didn't have as much action as the other books, or films. It did have a lot of character development though. The film provoked much more laughter than any other HP film, and still captured the spirit of the book very well. I cried when he died, so I obviously felt connected to the characters, as intended.  This movie was quite good, and I will buy it on DVD so I can watch it again, but it also could have been that much better.",1247702400,4,2705,4.534836065573771

3276181,5,B000ZECQ08,"I loved this movie. It is by far the best of the series.

Anyone who has written a review or will write a review bashing this movie because it isn't just like the book, need to take a step back. If you don't go to these movies expecting big changes, then you, my friend are a complete idiot.
Think of them as two entirely different entities, because they are. If they tried to copy all of the brilliant novel into the movie, it would be a complete mess. Books are beautiful and can take the time to develop smaller story threads and secondary characters, but movies don't have that luxury. They have to be more focused on main characters and the main plot line.
For example, one reviewer was barking mad because the Dumbledore withered hand story thread was, as he put it, ""glossed over"". No offense, but it is pretty glossed over in the book as well. It is mentioned more, but you don't really find out the whole story about it until the seventh book anyway, so why waste screen time on it.

I love the books. They are the most outstanding read on my book shelf, and I continue to pour through them over and over. The books are better than the movies, but then again, when isn't that true???? The books are always better than the movies!!!!! That doesn't mean that the movies can't be enjoyed and loved for what they are.
I for one, admire what the screen writers do. I would hate to try and condense JK's brilliant novels into workable screen scripts.

In short, don't be a moron. Love the books and then go see the movies and love them too!!! You can love both. Just remember they aren't going to be the same!!! If you don't, you are robbing yourself of the pleasure of enjoying some great cinema, BASED ON a bloody brilliant set of books.",1247702400,6,1742,4.37037037037037
3276182,3,B000ZECQ08,"As a huge Harry Potter fan who has read the last two books with excitment and breathlessness, I had come to this film prepared to accept that the film is always different from the book and that I should steel myself. And I did, briefy, till I started to see the glaring omissions in this film that were left on the cutting room floor.  Yes, I am well aware that the whole book cannot be filmed, understandable, but the heart of the book is Tom Riddle and the mystery of the Half blood Prince, anyone who is a true Potter fan should take no issue with that.  So riddle me this with the following glaring holes in this film that are central heart of the story--let's a look at them...

There are a number of flash back scenes that build Tom Riddle's character. We get two. No mention of his affection for Hogwarts, or why Dumbledore was drawn to him. No mention of how he forms the cruxis of the death eaters while he is a student there, which includes Snape.

Our wonderful Wizard's hand- how did it get that way? Harry barely registers any surprise.  Why show his hand if you are not going to explain how he got that way and how crucial it is to the story.  Makes little sense.

The Half Blood Prince.  The whole counter point to Tom Riddle is Snape. It is barely given a glancing blow in the film and Alan Rickman's role is wasted as his entire back story is thrown to the cutting room floor. Why spend so much time with this character if you are going to gut his part in the story.

Silly Teen Romance. Yes we all enjoy the moments of light humor and teen angst, but why amp it up so high for this one and leave all the good stuff on the trash pile.  There is way to much silliness in this film that takes away from the story and all I wanted to do was go back to the real tale each time they deal with this nonsense. Rowling new that these romances have to play a back shadow to much larger issues in the story, the directors decided after all the criticisms that the film was becoming increasingly dark that they'd lighten it up.  Big mistake.

Harry and his connection to Tom Riddle is also given no shrift at all, not even short shrift. Hell, The Dark one himself other then The Tom Riddle flashback, makes no appearence.

The last twenty minutes are from the last part of the book, so how can you forget the dumbledore funeral and battle with the death eaters when malfoy lets them in. gone!!

The heart of this movie is left out, and I fear audiences are embracing it because it is Harry Potter. Please go read the Half blood prince so you can see what you are missing. You won't regret it. It's a masterful book.  It is a shame the directors could not take the proper time and care to give it its due.",1247702400,27,2710,4.204633204633205
3276183,2,B000ZECQ08,"I don't know why some directors feel the need to change the movie adaption unecessarily.  Also with this movie and the last there was no feeling for Dumbledore, I didn't care that he died or that he had to drink the potion.

Why did they make Snape look like a rock-star with flowing clean hair?  Snapes intentions were too obvious as to what he did at the end.

Did the creators even read the book or just base the movie on a synopsis?",1247702400,13,436,4.216867469879518
3276184,2,B000ZECQ08,"I found Half-Blood to be very depressing and even worse, so predictable! There is no greater sin in writing a story, except being boring! The story also made no sense. No, I did not read the books, nor would I ever waste my time. The only strength in the world of Harry Potter is the bond amongst friends. This strong sense of friendship and loyalty is the only reason this annoying film was given two stars instead of one!

I guess that's the reason why I, and many other people, keep going to the theater. Of the six films, only the previous one, ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"" felt enjoyable and made plenty of sense. In Half-Blood, I'm amazed that you can kill off a major character and have even Harry Potter, himself, going around saying: ""It was a waste, it had no meaning. He died for nothing."" How ironic when a story's main character literally sums up the ENTIRE story!

I had high hopes for Half-Blood! I don't like seeing Harry Potter and all the other ""Good Guys"" being so powerless/clueless, or a main character turning into pure evil for absolutely no reason, whatsoever! (I should be able to know what's going on by not having to read the books. I have watched every film in order, but it still made no sense!)

What is obvious to me is that the Harry Potter series has become a commodity like toothpaste and underarm deodorant! Lets stretch a very thin storyline into as many billions of dollars as possible, and see all the star-struck idiots spend their money! Sorry to say, Harry Potter could have easily been condensed into a trilogy and if Half-Blood was never written/filmed it would not have harmed the Harry Potter storyline ONE iota!

Sorry, but when the grand finale(s) (I just heard the ending is being split into two movies! What a surprise) comes out, I'm skipping the theaters and  I'll watch it when I can see it for free. I have spent enough money on Harry Potter movie tickets and I have no intention, whatsoever, to waste another penny on making the writers and filmmakers of Harry Potter, richer!

3276185,5,B000ZECQ08,"I just got back from seeing it a few hours ago and it's very good, it's yet another amazing ""Harry Potter"" movie! I loved it! Just like the book, this movie focuses on Harry and Dumbledore using Voldemort's memories to try to find his seven Horcruxes in order to destroy them all and defeat him. In order to do this, Dumbledore and Harry hire a new teacher for the Potions class, Horace Slughorn, who has the memory of when Voldemort finds out about Horcruxes and decides to make them, which he doesn't want to give up. Also, Voldemort makes Draco Malfoy try to kill Dumbledore and, at the beginning of the film, the Death Eaters destroy a huge bridge in the Muggle world and eventually attack the Weasleys. Finally, there's a lot of stuff about the relationships/love between the characters, such as Lavender Brown falling in love with, and stalking, Ron, Harry eventually falling in love with, and kissing Ginny, and Ron and Hermione falling in love with each other. Eventually, the events of Dumbledore and Harry looking for and finding some of the Horcruxes leads to Dumbledore being killed by Snape, and a very powerful, emotionally moving ending. The storyline includes almost everything from the book, except, unfortunately, Kreacher and Dobby, Winky, and the other house-elves, and some of the scenes are a little bit less dramatic, such as when Harry has to force Dumbledore to drink the pain-inducing potion so they can get a Horcrux and when Harry battles Snape after Snape killed Dumbledore. The special effects are incredible, just like the other ""Harry Potter"" movies, such as when Dumbledore and Harry apparate to the cave where Voldemort's Horcrux is and the computer-animated Inferi. I loved this movie and I'm going to get it on DVD when it comes out! It was another amazing ""Harry Potter"" movie and I can't wait to see ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Parts One and Two"" when they come out in 2010 and 2011 and I'm going to get them on DVD too! After you see this movie, you'll be very excited for the last two movies!",1247616000,4,2043,4.741573033707865
3276186,4,B000ZECQ08,"While the fifth installment provided some of the darkest moments seen in the series, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince displays an even more sinister and morbid approach to the deadly witchcraft and devious wizardry. But with that darkness comes an alleviating light found in the romantic mishaps and jealous tussles between the students. Blending the foreboding presence of encroaching doom with Quidditch practice, schoolwork, and blossoming high school romances, the sixth entry in the legacy of Harry Potter is simultaneously the most mature and the most entertaining, though the days of playful sorcery and lighthearted misadventures are long gone.

In the sixth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry it is dark times indeed. The school itself has become a breeding ground for danger and deception and the surmounting minions of the evil Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) have brought forth destruction even to the innocents of the outside world of muggles. As a new potions teacher, Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent), is recruited for mysterious reasons, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) must contend with ominous missions from Headmaster Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) as well as his growing feelings for Ginny Weasly (Bonnie Wright) and the newfound jealous tension between his best friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson).

If you're willing to make the five-movie investment, the sixth Harry Potter film is well worth the time. Startlingly suspenseful, tenebrous and scarier than the previous films, with a generously lenient PG rating, the characters have finally reached the point where their budding relationships and daunting trials against the dark arts are almost entirely adult. It's a new kind of Harry Potter film with a Tim Burtonesque feel and wondrously foreboding sets and atmospheres (Diagon Alley now resembles the battered, rain-beaten streets in Sweeney Todd). Harry always seems to be covered in blood or unconscious, Hogwart's security has reached the point of a prison, the spells have turned to curses, the charms into hexes, and the potions into deadly black magic. Even the colors appear washed with blackness or drastically muted. By the end of it all, Harry's going to need an extra dose of liquid luck and the audience will need a hearty round of butterbeer with ginger.

Perhaps most appealing about the series is the opportunity to see a group of children become young adults, and to journey with them in their adventurous maturation. Any one year seems inconsequential compared to the larger picture, the grand scheme of mastering fantastical powers and defeating the many avenues of evil. Along the way there are plenty of chances at humor and lightheartedness, especially in the evolving relationships (such as a spirited snogging-filled love triangle) between Harry, Hermione, Ginny, Ron, and newcomer Lavender Brown, as well as several important supporting characters including the many schoolteachers, friends, families and enemies. As the characters become old enough for their interactions and expressions to mean more and for their actions to become more significant, powerful or even fatal, the entertainment is more solid and the story more fulfilling. Even if it plays out like they're all making it up as they go, the tragedies feel authentic and the leads are genuinely sympathetic. Finally the chemistry, adventure, special effects and fantasy can all be taken seriously.

3276187,3,B000ZECQ08,This movie was really slow to me. I have never read the book so I don't have a comparison between the two. I was pretty much bored until about the last 35 to 40 minutes. The movie really picked up around that time frame. The story and a lot of the action come together during this time frame. The special effects and the cinematography were pretty good. It was the story that was a little too slow for me. My 10 year old son read all the series and told me he liked the book better than the movie. This movie is really for hard core Harry Potter fans.,1247616000,2,551,4.064220183486238
3276188,5,B000ZECQ08,"`Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince' was a pretty good movie. Actually, it was better than I expected and one of my favorites. As with the rest of the movie, the plot moves as super speed as entire parts of the book are eliminated. This makes the movie feel a little choppy and dizzying, often. This is definitely not a stand alone film, and if you have not seen the others or read the books, you are going to feel very lost.

The cinematography is amazing; it is the best of all the movies so far. The movie has amazingly breathtaking scenes, a great score and tons of action.

This film follows Harry Potter, a wizard, through his sixth year at Hogwarts, a school for wizards. Harry is the chosen one, he alone has to the power to defeat Voldermont, a dark wizard who terrorized the magic world and killed Harry's parents. This movie centers around Harry learning more about how to defeat Voldermont from Dumbledore, the headmaster. This is also a movie that deals with character's relationships to one another as battle lines are drawn and romantic relationships deepen.

However, tons of things were left out, as always. But, this felt more like they chopped away half of the book. Poof, these parts are no more. And they were important parts: explaining more about the Horcruxes, Slytherin's locket, the funeral, Harry and Ginny's relationship...

And did the Inferi (corpses controlled by dark magic) have to look so much like Gollum?

It was a very good movie. It felt pretty short (even thought it was 153 mins long) as a result of the chopping of many parts of the stories. But, I still liked it. A lot.",1247616000,3,1616,4.616724738675958
3276189,4,B000ZECQ08,"After the utter disaster that was the Clif's Notes movie version of ""Harry Potter and The Order of the Phoenix"" (see my review for that film), I was filled with very great trepidation that this series was entirely doomed.  I went into the theater half expecting that David Yates and Co. would butcher yet another great book.

I must admit that I was wrong.

""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" is a good movie!

There is a lot to like about this film, and the criticisms I have are relatively minor.

Before I discuss details, I'll say this, though:  What is most important is that they got the FEEL of the book right.  There is emotion here, thank goodness!  Laughter, sadness, romance.  Wonderful!  Thank you, Steve Kloves, for writing a good screenplay!  Welcome back!  (Kloves was the screenwriter for every HP movie other than OOTP.)

Now, down to the details...  (I'll put in here *SPOILER ALERT*, but you kinda should expect that.)

Every time a book is converted into a movie, the two main criticisms that lovers of the book have are ones of omission and commission.  That is, the moviemakers either leave out beloved scenes, or choose to add their own scenes that AREN'T in the book.  Being somewhat of a purist myself, I usually prefer that the movie stick as closely to the book as possible, like Lord of the Rings mostly did.  However, a movie is a movie and a book is a book---so the real question in my mind is whether or not the omissions and commissions are basically positive and make a good film.

OOTP did both of these things badly-- it left out really important stuff, and the stuff it added was just bad.

HBP mostly did both of these things well-- it left in most of the important stuff, and (other than one thing) added mostly good additional scenes.

The movie begins with Death Eaters wreaking havoc in Muggle London, and Harry Potter putting the moves on a pretty Muggle waitress.  There is no meeting with the Muggle Prime Minister, like in the book.  (I'm fine with that--- you have to cut SOMETHING.)  Things are looking bad.

Harry and Dumbledore visit a potential new Potions professor, Horace Slughorn. Harry manages to convince him to come back to Hogwarts--- as he learns later, because has something that Dumbledore wants, and he thinks Harry can get it from him.

From there, the movie pretty much follows the plot of the book fairly closely.  Most well-loved scenes from the book are here--- some done better than others, but all are mostly OK.

One thing that the screenwriters added that I think was actually an IMPROVEMENT over the book is that they flesh out the budding romance between Harry and Ginny, and between Ron and Hermione. (To be honest, in my opinion the relationship between Harry and Ginny wasn't given enough development in the books-- one of the few criticisms I had of the books.)  These additional scenes are really done well.  They are heartfelt and subtle, not cheesy at all.  I really loved the scene on the stairs where Harry and Hermione comfort each other because each is in love with someone who is currently with someone else.

I won't parse the rest of the film, since everyone basically knows the plot.  But most things are done well.

Now, onto my several minor criticisms.

First of all, the filmmakers added a scene which I felt was gratuitous and stupid, and which added nothing to the story at all.  In one scene the Death Eaters attack The Burrow and destroy it.  That was just needless and heartless.  The Burrow was the one place where Harry could feel safe, and to destroy it felt like a kick in the gut for no reason.  You know, as long as there is a Shire to go back to, there is always something to fight for.  To destroy the Burrow-- the one place Harry felt most at home--- was a serious misstep as far as I'm concerned, because it just made the whole endeavor now feel hopeless.  Seriously, WHY DO THIS???  This was the one major mistake I feel the filmmakers made.

A couple other minor criticisms are that I felt that the movie Slughorn could have been a little sluggier and and little more pompous.  The movie version was a little too normal for my liking.  Not horrible, still pretty good--- but not great, and not as memorable as the book.

Another thing I think might have been better was the actor who played the teenage Voldemort.  I was a great fan of the actor Christian Coulson who played Tom Riddle in Chamber of Secrets.  He got the teenage Tom Riddle down perfectly--- charismatic, enigmatic, charming, with just a touch of an undercurrent of danger--- and TOTALLY memorable.  The young actor who plays Tom Riddle in this film plays him more creepy, less human, and entirely less charming, charismatic and memorable.  He plays him like those creepy kids who roam the hallways in The Shining--- and kind of looks like them too.

One other things I was a tad bit disappointed in was that the Great Hall in this film is not as great as those in the other films---- I don't know how they did it, but this Great Hall is much SMALLER!

However, let me reemphasize:

Other than those minor complaints, Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince is a GOOD movie, with heart, feeling, romance, action and intrigue.  A worthy contribution to the HP movie canon.

Enjoy!",1247616000,,5259,4.596774193548387
3276190,3,B000ZECQ08,"On a scale of one to five, I only give ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" three stars...and that's being incredbly generous.

I really, really, REALLY wanted to like this film, and there are moments of the movie that are absolutely fantastic. The problem is that all those scenes start off great, and then fizzle out into nothing spectacular. This film also cuts and changes a lot of info from the book, and changes certain things from the novel that had no business being changed. I just don't understand it.

Without giving too much away, here are some of the things that irked me about this movie (if you haven't read the book, though, beware that there are spoilers ahead):

 - The first 20 minutes or so of the film are AWFUL. They are nothing like the opening chapters of the book, which is a huge disappointment. Dumbledore especially bothers me at the beginning of the movie. His dialogue is ridiculous, and the significance of his withered hand are glossed over in an offhand remark to Harry. (Also, that hand looks nothing like it should. In the movie, Dumbledore's hand looks like its owner has merely been outside gardening for a couple of hours. In the book, the hand is supposed to be a black, charred, disgusting mess. Why cut corners on the big screen?)

- Also in regards to the first few minutes of the book, I was disappointed that the Snape/Narcissa/Bellatrix scene was pushed back until later in the film, and was exceptionally brief. It could have been much better.

- Too much of the movie was devoted to silly romance. Don't get me wrong: The Ron/Hermione/Lavender triangle was a big part of Book Six, and the actress playing Lavender in the film was absolutely hysterical. However, too much time was devoted to teenage romance instead of other important plot elements that were completely cut out  of the film altogether.

- Speaking of silly romance, the Harry/Ginny relationship was really shafted in the movie. It started off well, but never really climaxed at all. At the end of the book, Harry and Ginny are officially an item, and there's a very poignant moment where Harry tells Ginny why they can't be together because he'll inadvertently put her in danger and because he needs to fulfill his destiny, etc. That scene was completely omitted from the movie, and in the film, you really don't know if Harry and Ginny are really together or not. It's ridiculous!

- Fenrir Greyback's character in the movie was a MASSIVE disappointment. He appeared in the film, but no one even really knew that he was a werewolf, because the whole scene where he attacks Bill Weasley was omitted from the film! Why include the character at all if they were going to cut that scene? It makes absolutely no sense!

- Too much time was devoted to Draco Malfoy practicing for his ""grand event."" Tom Felton did a great job portraying Draco in this film, but seriously, did the filmmakers really need to include four or five separate scenes of Draco practicing using the vanishing cabinet? I don't think so.

- For me, the last 25 minutes or so of the film were the biggest disappointment of all. The worst part about it is that certain aspects of these scenes were amazing: the visual setting when Dumbledore and Harry arrive at the mouth of the cave, the dialogue between Snape and Dumbledore at the tower, etc. Unfortunately, though, the scenes that started off great ended up sucking. For example, the ""evil souls"" living in the lake were total rip-offs of Gollum from ""The Lord of the Rings,"" and didn't look anything like I imagined that they should. Also, I hated the death scene at the end, which was poorly done and happened way too quickly. The Snape/Harry confrontation at the end of the film also seemed incredibly lackluster. I really wanted Harry to scream at Snape and go nuts on him, but instead Daniel Radcliffe just kind of muttered, ""Coward,"" and that was it.

- The ending of the film was TERRIBLE! After the death, only about 30 people were gathered around the body, and no one was freaking out the way they do in the book. HELLO! One of the most important characters in the series is dead! Doesn't anyone care? All they do is hold their wands up in the air for a few seconds in some sort of pathetic salute. It's awful! It was so subdued. And where was the funeral?! In the book, people travel from all over the world to attend the service, and the coffin goes up in white flames, which would have been a great way to end the movie. Instead, the audience was left with a boring shot of the back of Harry, Ron, and Hermione's heads. It was awful!

I really expected more from this film. Again, I will concede that there were some decent moments, but I think the script and the overall direction were severely lacking. I really hope they don't screw up the final two films in the series. Warner Brothers Execs, if you are reading this, I hereby volunteer to adapt the screenplay for ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,"" and to direct both movies for free just to make sure they are done right!",1247616000,26,5030,4.6067039106145256
3276191,4,B000ZECQ08,"One aspect of this series that consistently impresses me is seeing how the characters grow both in written word and film. ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" is a darker, harsher world than the previous entries leading into the conclusion of the series.

In the very beginning, we see devastating attacks by the death eaters on London in full view of the regular (muggle) population. Albus Dumbledore (Gambon) solicits Harry Potter (Radcliffe) to come with him to convince retired Prof. Slughorn (Broadbent) to come back to Hogwarts to teach Potions. There's more than just filling an empty faculty chair on the cagey wizard's mind, though.  He wants Harry to allow Slughorn to 'capture' him.

Harry returns to the Weasley home to BFF's Ron (Grint) and Hermione (Watson) and the rest of the clan. Disappearances are still happening and many parents do not want their children to return to Hogwarts.  Even Hermoine's muggle family don't want her back.

Next, we move to Severus Snape (Rickman) taking an oath to protect Draco Malfoy (Felton) and help him carry out the mission Voldemort has pressed upon him.

Definitely an excellent setup for a film where a lot has to happen even in a three-hour timespan.  The cast is getting older. Harry and Hermione are both suffering the blues when their respective love interests are turning to others. Dumbledore is relying more and more on Harry who has learned to simply go with it. Of course, there are the usual intrigues and Quidditch games as well.

This is not my favorite HP film, but definitely one I would own and very much worth the time to see it on opening night.  Excellent setup for the final two films in the series.  I will hate to say goodbye to this cast.

3276192,3,B000ZECQ08,"The much touted 6th Harry Potter movie made quite a spectacle, tons of effects, beautiful shots and the old crowd all together.  It filled up a lot of midnight movie screen in my area.  I decided to wait till the next day and was very glad I did.

Harry Potter and the half blood prince was a cute movie about dating and teenage angst, but it really wasn't worth all the fuss.  It seemed like it was trying to be a serious Hanna Montana episode in terms of how it did things.

Individual scenes were interesting, the Broadbent plot was fair, but the whole deatheater bit just didn't seem to have any purpose.

The entire plot surrounding Draco was wasted.  It consisted of ""I'm going to brood over here."", then ""I'm going to brood over here now."" until the climax.  If you are going to have a tortured soul in an interactive medium like movies you need more than just sitting here there and everywhere looking pained.  When the climax came Draco didn't seem like someone torn over what he has to do, he seems like a little git.  That was ok when he was a first or second year but at this point in the series that's not where we should be.

The big three have grown into the characters and where worth seeing but even good performances by them couldn't bail out bad writing.

The plan is to milk the last book by making it two movies, hopefully this will give them enough time to make things work.

For the visuals alone you should see it in a theater but it just isn't any better than average.",1247616000,3,1493,4.308243727598566
3276193,5,B000ZECQ08,"I'm not gonna give too much away, since fans who haven't seen it will be bitching about me giving all the changes away and crap. But anyways, this was an amazing movie... and yes I did read the book.

It was every bit as dark, grim and depressing as the book, and every bit as fun too. The acting was the real highlight- Radcliffe turns in an amazing performance as Harry once again, and Watson's crying scene was one of the most beautiful scenes ever filmed. The quidditch scenes were the amazing too! I'm glad they brought back the Quidditch. Also, the cave scene was brilliant, as it had one of the scariest jump scenes ever.

So overall, this was a fun movie, and a good time at the cinema. The second best movie of the year thus far! I hope to see it again at the IMAX upon IMAX release. And it's definitely The Dark Knight of the year too- bring on Deathly Hallows!",1247616000,2,871,4.2727272727272725
3276194,3,B000ZECQ08,"First of all, I have to say, I love the Harry Potter series, the movies as much as the books. And until now, every movie brought the flair the books had adequately to the big screen, without losing the essential messages and story points.
And now we have Half-Blood Prince.
I was curious how the movie would start, given the various excellent options by Rowling. Maybe the ingenius visit of Dumbledore at the Dursleys? Or the thrilling scene with the Unbreakable Vow? None of those! Of course not! Who would like to have a classic Harry Potter scene as the opener of your movie? The screenwriters flexed their muscles and came up with a brilliant bit of Potter legend: Harry picking up a funky chick at a Diner!

Now a simple question: here you have a book with 600 pages, and you actually choose to come up with THAT, thus bewildering the fans from the very first frame?
I mean, come on! The book has more than enough teenage romance already, what is the damn point of making stuff up?
And this does not remain the only major detour. Really, I have no objection to adding a few bits, as long as they are true to the story and the characters - but what on earth possessed Yates and Kloves to light the Burrow on fire?
This attack by the Death Eaters is THE textbook example of pointless guff, since nothing happens. And it hurts all the more if you consider for a moment that they conceived that scene instead of filming Harry's conversation with Scrimgeour, the new minister of magic.

But speaking of teenage romance, this was obviously a major part of the book, and honestly, it works better here than in textform. It is also quite logical that all the bickering and all the twists between Ron and Hermione, involving Ginny and Harry, simple can't be fleshed out, so consequently their row is not nearly as dramatic as in the book. In the book, Ron was first angry because he watched Ginny kissing Dean, which resulted in Ron being angry at Hermione because she kissed Victor Krum, which he wouldn't tell her, all of that causing Ron to go for Lavender Brown, and that finally pushed Hermione over the edge.
It's already exhausting explaining it, can you blame Yates for not putting ALL that into the film?
The sudden interest between Ron and Hermione, and Harry and Ginny, feel like out of the blue, but the movie can't mend what the book did.

What he substracted from the romance stories, he added to the Snape/Malfoy storyline. And I don't mean scenes, I mean additional layers. And those layers come dangerously close to compromising the point the book tries to make.
To be perfectly clear: Severus Snape is a Death Eater, he always was, he only spied on Dumbledore. He has no remorse, no second doubt. He offers to make the Unbreakable Vow. He is a villain, pure and simple. That's what makes him killing Dumbledore dramatic.
Here, in the film, Snape is pushed by Bellatrix to make the Vow, clearly indicating that he is a man in doubt, pushed to do it. That is wrong, simply.
Plus, by saying verbatim that Katie was supposed to bring the cursed amulet to Dumbledore, by *showing* several times what Malfoy is doing in the Room Of Requirement, by already piecing the puzzle together along the way, the film lacks some surprise, since Dumbledore's death at the hand of Snape does not come as a shock like in the book, it is a natural consequence.
And it isn't even handled properly.
The whole point is that Dumbledore was poisened, weak. Hearing Death Eaters coming, he uses his last chance of defending himself to stun Harry, to protect him. And Snape has Dumbledore at his mercy, he is killing a poisened, defenseless man. The movie is not nearly brutal enough in that regard.
And it does not even make the point explicitly that Dumbledore's trust in Snape was wrong.
Rowling knew what she was writing in those crucial scenes, surely there is no point in completely rewriting it, implicating that it wasn't good.

Why is it so hard for these people to follow simple rules? Cut parts that don't disturb the main story. Use editorial force if following the book word by word takes too long. Make the point the book is trying to make, even if you have to do it in a slightly different way. Don't leave out signature set pieces of the book.
In short, Dumbledore's funeral is not there. That is a no-no. And unforgiveable if you ask me.
And what is that stupid ceremony at the end anyway? All the students standing there, were they rehearsing that collective lightshow in case Dumbledore ever gets killed?

The point is that things were changed for no reason. If you show Harry getting the memory from Slughorn by using Felix Felicis, the for god's sake do it like the book does, and not like THIS. They obviously didn't get the point that the potion causes coincidences leading to your goal.

One other minus point is that Harry's lessons in Dumbledore's office seem to serve no reason. It's just presented like ""here is that little story I want to show you"".
It is simply never explained why those memories are of any importance at all. If they wanted to set up the Horcrux storyline, then surely the story of the House Of Gaunt or the story of the cup and the locket would suit the case better than that short visit at the orphanage.

The visuals are fine, and in fact very moody and atmospheric. It's just obscure to me why a large part of the movie is coloured with that greenish hue, and the only scene in the book that actually mentions the green light - in the cave - does not have it.
The music is terrible. Truly horrid. A string ostinato here, and a string of chords there, that's all there's to it. It's not even atmospheric music, it's Nicholas Hooper desperately hitting random chords.
Often I just thought ""he didn't score THIS?""
Some pieces from the album are not there, and during the Quidditch tryouts, the original score, whatever it was, was replaced by Order of the Phoenix music.

All in all, if you have never read the book, you might enjoy this as much as the other films, but if you read it, prepare to not be overwhelmed.",1247616000,14,6052,4.540788267644363
3276195,5,B000ZECQ08,"I'm not sure anyone will be prepared for the ending of ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince."" Even if, like me, you've already read the book and know what happens, there's something about actually seeing it on screen that thoroughly and devastatingly brings it home. That's the magic of the movies for you. Indeed, this sixth installment may be the most magical yet ... albeit magical in that heavy, sinister sort of way, as if Lord Voldermort himself waved his wand and cast a spell on it. Strange that this is simultaneously the darkest film in the series and the funniest, the sense of humor having matured from innocent and childlike to troubled and adolescent. Stranger still that this is the best ""Harry Potter"" film since the original ""Sorcerer's Stone,"" a brighter and much more whimsical and story in all respects.

When reviewing ""Order of the Phoenix"" a few years ago, I begrudgingly remarked that I had to accept the ever-changing nature of the series, that the wondrous atmosphere of Chris Columbus' original film had developed into something denser and would never go back. I now find myself in the exact same position with ""Half-Blood Prince."" But I can't kid myself--this is a superbly made fantasy, and in spite of increasingly dark material, it retains much of the charm that attracted me to the series in the first place. The performances, even by briefly seen actors like Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, Helena Bonham Carter, David Thewlis, and Warwick Davis, are very good. The set design and cinematography are stunning. The special effects are dazzling. The mystery is engrossing. Just like before, it's all there--it's only gotten a little less bright on the way. Hogwarts, for example, no longer seems like an adventurous labyrinth of surprises but like a gloomy, gothic fortress, and the school grounds are foggier and less colorful.

The first part of the story: After the dreaded Death Eaters attack London in full view of Muggles, our increasingly burdened Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is lead by Headmaster Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) to the home of Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent), a former Hogwarts professor who knew Voldermort when he was a boy still going by the name Tom Riddle. Dumbledore convinces Slughorn to come out of hiding and return to school as the new Potions teacher. He also relies on Harry to get close to join Slughorn's class and get to know him, which shouldn't be too hard since Slughorn loves to play favorites with his students. But why does he want Harry to do this? What does Slughorn have that Dumbledore wants?

More important questions arise. Who is the titular Half-Blood Prince, and why did he add notes and revisions to every potion spell in Harry's textbook? Why is Harry's enemy, Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), spending all his time away from class? He's not the same mean, confrontational boy he used to be; he's seething, withdrawn, and seemingly always on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Why is he guarded so closely by the brooding Severus Snape (Alan Rickman), who is this year's newest Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher?

The second part of the story: Harry and his best friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) are now sixteen years old, which is to say that they're in the thick of teen romances. Hermione is starting to have feelings for Ron, which is why she doesn't take kindly to Ron's new date, an infatuated young girl named Lavender Brown (Jessie Cave). At the same time, Hermione catches the eye of Gryffindor House's newest Quiddich player, a smug young man named Cormac McLaggen (Freddie Stroma). She, however, has absolutely no interest in him. As for Harry, the relationship that bloomed in ""Order of the Phoenix"" between him and Cho Chang has been pushed aside in favor of a relationship between him and Ron's sister, Ginny (Bonnie Wright).

As far as these characters go, I was most impressed with the way Hermione was developed. She's well on her way to womanhood, and as such, she's genuinely jealous of the attention Ron gives to Lavender. This is at times funny, as when she intentionally asks Cormac to a Christmas party. It's also at times surprisingly tender, as when she clings to Harry's arm, silently weeping. Emma Watson has always been good as Hermione, but her range has never been as far-reaching as it is in this film. The same can be said for Rupert Grint, especially during a scene in which he accidentally eats chocolates spiked with a powerful love potion.

The final act begins with Harry and Dumbledore visiting a seaside cave and having a frightening encounter with demon-like water creatures. It only goes downhill from there in terms of tone, and that brings me back to the ending. What an emotionally draining way to finish a ""Harry Potter"" film. Those who have not read J.K. Rowling's original novel may not be prepared for it. But even if that's the case, I can't in good conscience recommend that anyone avoid this film. ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" may be darker than its predecessors, but it's filled to the brim with style and imagination, and it reveals new dimensions to characters we've come to know and love. With only the seventh and eighth films left (the final book being split into two screenplays), we can begin the process of looking back and remembering how great an experience it has been.",1247616000,5,5374,4.87417943107221
3276196,5,B000ZECQ08,"Wide-eyed wonder, a sly sense of humor, a truly disturbing villain... this sixth installment in the Harry Potter series has all this plus a striking visual style. Although Potter newbies will be lost (the movie assumes you know what has gone before and who the characters are), Harry's fans will be thrilled.

The story is complex even for followers of the series. Headmaster Albus Dumbledore, after scolding Harry about being reckless over the summer for riding London subway trains, leads the young wizard on one dangerous adventure after another. The goal is to stop He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, the Dark Lord Voldemort, who is growing in power and murdering people both in and out of the magical world. The secret to stopping the Dark Lord lies with Professor Slughorn, who taught at Hogwarts when Voldemort was simply a student named Tom Riddle. Slughorn has a repressed memory that Harry must observe to understand how to destroy Voldemort. He observes by plunging his face into liquid memories in a glowing bowl called a Pensieve. (Well named, as a ""pensive"" person is quietly reflecting on a memory.)

When Dumbledore says ""That was fun!"" after performing a bit of magic, I agreed with him, and gave myself over to the story. In the last couple of Harry Potter movies, the characters' reaction to their magic has been sort of perfunctory and humdrum. In ""Half-Blood Prince"" the wonder -- and the fun -- is back.

Most of the humor comes from teenage romances, notably involving Harry's best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Grainger, and Ron's sister Ginny. Ron's misadventures with the smitten Lavender Brown -- and Hermione's reaction -- are funny and true-to-life. Ron complains to Harry that he must dump Lavender because of the non-stop kissing: ""My lips are getting chapped!"" And a conversation between the two boys about noticing who has nice skin -- Harry mentions Ginny's skin; Ron Hermione's -- is sweet, and revealing.

The considerable chills in ""Half-Blood Prince"" come courtesy of the evil Voldemort's birth in the young student Tom Riddle. When you first meet the boy in a memory, he is so strange, so creepy and odd, you have compassion for him. What awful thing must have happened to him to make him this way? Voldemort seems scarier here as a quietly evil student than as the freakish monster he turns into.

The cinematography is stunning. The coloring and lighting make scenes seem like works of art. Often the color is bleached from the screen, with only one item in color (usually red). Other shots are infused with silvery light, giving landscapes and objects an otherworldly look. Steep, angular camera angles make scenes dramatic and emotional. It's a visual feast.

One thing I didn't miss was the buffoonish Dursley family, Harry's adoptive relatives, who are absent in ""Half-Blood Prince."" All three seemed too much like cartoons for my taste. The new characters are much more fun, notably loopy Luna with her oddball fashion sense and boy-crazy Lavender Brown.

Give yourself plenty of time for this one: it clocks in at two and a half hours. When it's over, you'll be more than ready for Harry's last chapter.",1247616000,34,3144,4.965779467680608
3276197,4,B000ZECQ08,"Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) enlists Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) to get close to Professor Slughorn, the new Potions teacher. He believes that he has an important memory of Tom Riddle/Lord Voldemort and wants Harry to get it. A used potions book of someone named the Half Blood Prince helps Harry to impress Slughorn and get closer to him. But who's the Half Blood Prince ?

  While Hermione starts to show her true feelings for Ron when he starts dating someone. But he's too clueless to realize she's jealous. He also joins the Quiditch team, but he isn't as bad as he is in the book, but with some help from Harry and Hermione. Harry's last year of Quiditch isn't made into that much of a big deal in the movie as well. But what was done well in the movie is how Draco has a mission from the Dark Lord that Snape (Alan Rickman) has promised to help him with it. While Harry knows Draco is up to something which leads him into more than one confrontation with him.

  I loved the first half of the movie but once it got towards the end, it felt a bit rushed. The Deatheater's battle with Hogwart students from the book was left out when I was looking forward to it. While Bill Weasley I think was totally cut out of the movies. The drama between Persey and his family was also left out. I think the movies would have been stronger if didn't leave out such things though. I liked how the Weaseley mom didn't like Bill's future wife in the book, which led to a good moment in the end. Here, all that was totally left out.

  I liked a lot about the movie though. I originally said that the Harry and Ginny scenes could have been better. Now that I think about it, I loved the scene where Ginny runs to help Harry in a fight with Deatheaters. The flashbacks of Voldermort as a child were also good. While the director David Yates is good at handling the dark side of the story as well as the humor and magic. He's one of the better Potter directors even if he does cut out some things. A lot of people want Chris Columbus back for the last film but he's lucky if he's hired to do a made for dvd Home Alone sequel after doing (I Love You Beth Cooper). David Yates is fine, it's the scripts that just need a little bit more development, other than that he does a good job.",1247616000,2,2265,4.248837209302326
3276198,5,B000ZECQ08,"I was highly impressed and very relieved by my first viewing of Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince.  Impressed because the film is a fine adaptation of the book while relieved that the unfortunate skimping of detail which so marred Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was not as apparent.  The Harry Potter series is a rare exception to the rule that sequels are never as good as the originals.

Naturally any book with as many subplots and characters as Half Blood Prince cannot be completely transferred to film  Some things are cut, like the Dursleys, while others are added, as in an early scene showing Harry at a Muggle diner.  What was cut did not mar the story and the additions were mostly in keeping with the overall tone.  Dark times have come to the wizard world.  Voldemort is extending his power, and even Muggles recognize that dark forces are at work.  Harry is now recognized by his fellow wizards as The Chosen One, and as a typical 16 year old it has gone to his head a bit.  He is torn between his need to be a teenager dealing with his emotions and those of his friends and would be lovers and his inescapable fate as the nemesis of the Dark Lord.

In The Half Blood Prince we learn more about the early history of Lord Voldemort, and these scenes are among the best in the film, showing young Tom Riddle in a Muggle orphanage and later as the most gifted and troubled student at Hogwarts.  We get some hints of what is to come in the final Deathly Hallows movies, but not so much that those who have not yet read the last book will have that experience ruined.  Though the overall tone is dark, there are some supremely hilarious moments, mainly dealing with Harry, Ginny, Ron, and Hermione's personal lives, as well as a very well portrayed Horace Slughorn.  The returning cast members continue to do remarkable job and we get more insights into some of their characters, particularly those of Draco Malfoy and Severus Snape.

The film is greatly enhanced by its fine soundtrack, some of it carryovers from  earlier films (like the overall theme music) including a couple of my favorites from The Order of the Phoenix: Fireworks and Dumbledore's Army.",1247616000,5,2184,4.564102564102564
3276199,5,B000ZECQ08,"When one waits 16 hours in a line to ensure they get good seats to a movie, it'll have to be one darn good film that they are seeing to make it worth it. I can say without a shadow of a doubt that `Half-Blood Prince,' the latest installment in the insanely popular Harry Potter franchise, is one darn good movie and would have been worth another six hours at least.

A long time has passed since Harry and Co. sat around the Great Hall and played wizard chess while worrying about their exams.  As year six dawns for our young heroes, everything, including their beloved Hogwarts, has a dark and menacing existence. Even the muggles are beginning to feel the effects of the rising evil in the wizarding world.

And so begins Year 6.

`Half-Blood Prince' is, despite the times, far and away the funniest of the Potter films.  The excellent writing is sharp, and downright hilarious at times. Steve Kloves really did a wonderful job of balancing the screenplay with a perfect combination of wit and storytelling, the end result being a film that is perfectly paced with not a dull moment to speak of. Superb writing.

The acting is, across the board, near-perfect. The three young stars all shine in their respective rolls. Daniel Radcliffe plays well the reluctant yet determined hero. He also shows his comedic side in an insanely memorable scene featuring Felix Felicius, liquid luck. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, despite not playing as large a roll as Radcliffe, are also excellent. Grint's dead nuts tone and facial expressions absolutely make the awkward romances that permeate the story.  A run in with a love potion gives Grint an opportunity to prove his comedic talents, and, boy, does he deliver.  Watson, on the other hand, is possibly the most improved and probably the best.  She has gotten her eyebrows under control for this one and is charming as Hermione.  While hers is a more serious role, she comes through brilliantly as well, especially in an emotional scene in which she is very convincing.

Also, the supporting cast is phenomenal.  Michael Gambon is excellent as Dumbledore, and Jim Broadbent proves a worthy addition to the cast as Professor Slughorn, a professor returning to teach at Hogwarts.  Bonnie Wright, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, and Helena Bonham-Carter round off the wonderful cast. Special mention to Tom Felton, who steps up to a larger role as the conflicted Draco Malfoy and does a superb job.

By the time you near the end of this movie, you may have trouble believing how it will end. Sure, through the laughs, you learn bits and pieces of the dark and mysterious past of Voldemort, but so far it has not been extremely heavy. Then comes the last half hour, which is perhaps the best part of the film. As Harry and Dumbledore travel to a dark cave in search of a missing piece of Voldemort's past, the tone of the whole film changes dramatically.  This change is handled perfectly, and catapults the viewers to the shocking and ultimately sobering end.

I will admit, it has been a while since I read the novel upon which this film is based. That said, I cannot vouch completely for the quality of the adaption. I can, however, think of several things that were added or taken away, right off the top of my head. Unlike with some of the films, however, these changes seem completely natural and irreprehensible.  I felt that the changes were handled well and for the bettering of the film and the franchise. To watch it without comparing it strictly to the book is how, ultimately, this film will be enjoyed fully.

One such change, at the end, is a funeral that has been removed from the film.  In it's place, however, is a wonderful sentiment by the teachers and students of Hogwarts that is an extremely emotional and a stirring symbolism. Just as the end of the book, it brought tears to my eyes. While it was different from the book, it was still extremely effective, and brought the heart of the novel to the screen.

The very last scene, in which Harry, Ron and Hermione discuss what will happen going forward, speaks to them as well as the audience. Nothing will be the same. They know that everything they have done to this point has been leading up to an epic climax that will decide the fate of the world. Just so, the audience not only sees, but FEELS the epic battle that is looming. And as Harry aptly observes of the school that will never be the same: ""I'm just beginning to realize how beautiful this is.""

J.K.Rowling's young wizard enters into his last full year of attending Hogwarts...I initially described the Half-Blood Prince novel as having a distinct post-911 feel to it...as does it's film counterpart...the Dark Lord is back to full strength (as seen in his battle with Dumbledore at the climax of ""Order of the Phoenix""), the wizarding world is now privy to the knowledge of this return and it is a very different place, than it was when we first met Harry back in the Sorcerer's Stone. There is an gloomy atmosphere of fear and foreboding evident even in the brief moments we see of the Muggle's perspective, in an early scene in which Harry reads of disasters impacting both worlds. Even the familiar Diagon Alley is ...well unfamiliar, shopkeepers packed and gone or worst , as we see wandmaker Ollivander abducted following the destruction of his shop ....the only wand casting ""lumos"" on this darkened new world the Weasley twins Joke shop, alas, all too brief. New concepts, like apparitions, Felix Felicis and Horcruxes are introduced and old ones like the memory exposition vehicle of the pensive return to great effect. Also returning is the Director of ""Order of the Phoenix"" David Yates who does a fine job giving the material a real world connection opening with attacks in London. Yates focuses on more matters of heart than any Potter film to date, not just the love potions and love interests. But, Harry and Dumbledore's connection, the bonds of family via the Weasleys, Draco's angst-filled moments all come alive. Yates' vision of Quidditch is the finest yet seen, here the wizard sport really feels like, well, a sport...bone crunching blocks and offensive plays! Great comedic moments, with Ron especially, truly scary moments with Voldemort's undead guardians and the curse-attack Katie Bell, made my hair stand on end (and her's). This is the most adult outing yet for the francise, not just the boy/girl issues of adolescent, but the cast has never been more comfortable in their roles...Ginny sure has come along way...and go re-watch the young neophyte Harry in Sorcerer's Stone if you doubt that.

Like many of the Potter stories/film this one contains it's share of exposition and flashback, but like it's predecessors , unique methods of delivering these ""flashbacks"" are used...this time we get the origin of the Dark Lord Voldemort via Dumbledore's visit to an orphanage to meet his future Nemesis. In addition to this, other answers are given as to how Tom Riddle became the seemingly immortal ""He who must not be named"" and what Harry must do to face him....the beginning of Harry's quest to defeat Voldemort. In addition to this, attacks on students begin and Hogwarts is (again) unsafe, but who is the real target...who is this assassin?. Meanwhile, love is in the air and candies, as Harry only belatedly realizes his would be truelove,...and Ron is still a mess, only this time with imbibed love potion.

Fortunately for the filmmakers ...the cast of the series has aged well and each has grown up to be attractive or at least interesting-looking (Daniel Radcliffe, Bonnie Wright, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint),recasting would have be unfortunate, so we don't really need to suspend disbelief to the level of say Frankie and Annette in a Beach flick, everyone young enough for the big screen vision of the books. Among the returning cast is Tom Felton a Harry's school nemesis Draco Malfoy, given so much more to work with in this one Felton is growing worthy of the adult veterans he shares scenes with (namely Alan Rickman terrifically cast as Prof. Snape)... Dumbledore is again Michael Gambon, who replace the late great Richard Harris, Gambon is much better in this feature than in previous films, but I feel the emotional content greatly diminished by his presence instead of his predecessor, Evanna Lynch again makes with the scene stealing as Luna Lovegood (who replaces the Tonks character for early scenes, to greater effect than the original text), Bellatrix Lestrange  played so wonderfully wicked by Helena Bonham Carter that a completely original  sequence is added at the Burrow.. as some old roles are expanded others are reduced, like scenes with Draco's sidekicks Crabbe & Goyle as little girls, most unfortunately Neville Longbottom has maybe one line...considering his importance to the final moments of the final installment I fear even this will be cut....absent entirely are Harry's horrible non-wizard kin the Dursleys (shame to as the scene with Dumbledore berating their abuse would have been great to see come to screen). New to the series Jim Broadbent's DELIGHTFUL Professor Slughorn this installment's obligatory new teacher to Hogwarts, also new and satisfyingly chilling to watch is Hero Fienn Tiffin as an 11-year-old Tom Riddle in a flashbacks, who is the real nephew of Ralph Fiennes, who plays the adult Voldemort, who is absent from ""Half-blood Prince"" physically, but he's presence surely has weight that is felt in nearly every scene as Dumbledore preps Harry for his final battle with the Dark Lord. Lines about Harry's blood being more precious than his own, really take this notion home.

Overall: ""HALF-BLOOD"" is a way, WAAY abridged and jazzed up Hollywood version of the book for the screen....in many ways better than any of the series to date. The perfect balance of comedy, horror and action that makes the HP films successful...so to the cast and crew I say ""Mischief managed!""

If you have read the book and want to know what was cut and what wasn't......OTHERWISE DON'T READ ON ....SPOILERS BELOW...

The Other Minister and recap of over 5 years of book exposition and  intro to the new Minister of Magic Scrimgeour replaces Fudge...yep it was cut.

Snape Takes the Unbreakable oath to protect Draco on his mission for the Dark Lord...the unedited version is another 5 year (plus) explanation of why he didn't kill Harry and why he is still Voldemort's most faithful servant....this is edited, but kept.

Harry & the Dursley's ....Dumbledore's visit to Privot Drive...exposition on Harry as heir to his Godfather's estate/ the Order's HQ and house elf  Kreacher (who's important to the 7th Book)....also cut, replaced with ""Harry at a Diner flirting with a waitress""...strange.

Harry and Dumbledore's stop over recruitment of Slughorn, is interesting for revealing the atmosphere in the wizarding world as they find the would be Professor hiding out, fearing for his life. I figured this would be cut....but they kept it...rounding out Slughorn nicely.

Things go a lot faster after reaching the Burrow...Wedding subplot? No. Lots less Tonks and no Fleur, thankfully...added at the Burrow is a Xmas action sequence...instead of Harry's confrontation with the new Minister, makes sense, but sort of eliminates the need for the Wedding attack in HP7, or a wedding at all without Bill or Fleur.

Trip to Diagon Alley still includes Joke Shop (didn't seeU-NO-POO?), like a mentioned before, and Malfoy is tailed without any confrontation as clues to his destiny are given in Knockturn Alley..

Trouble on the Hogwarts express is kept, while the Slughorn ""meet and greet"" is altered.
Tonks is cut and swapped out for Luna, which I like better, the Tonks / Lupin stuff in the book seems too contrived, even more so than Harry.

Harry gets his used Textbook, care of the Half-Blood Prince load with tips, ...becomes a potion expert, but the Prince's Levicorpus spell does not appear the film (odd cause it is in the tie-in game), Sectumsempra is as we see when Harry fights Draco again, hides the book, with help from Ginny as a vehicle for their moment alone...

Harry and Dumbledore's private lessons and flashbacks happen minus the story of Voldemort's mother? Both versions of Slughorn's memory, too.

Aragog's funeral is included, while Harry is on ""Luck"" but the closing Funeral of the story isn't included...we do see poor ole Fawkes, fly off into the setting sun.",1247616000,3,8056,5.039819684447783
3276201,1,B000ZECQ08,"Please know there will be SPOILERS in this review regarding the book and the movie versions of the Half-Blood Prince.

I left this movie feeling the most disappointed in any book to movie adaptation I have ever seen in a film.  Many of the past Potter films have left out or reworked parts of the book that really bothered me, but not as much as this film did.  One of my two major issues with this film, and there are many smaller ones, is that there was NO BATTLE at the school!!!  The death eaters waltz in, kill the headmaster, and waltz out??!?!  Are you kidding me?  All the work of the D.A., not the mention the school defenses, and they don't even notice that these guys are blasting out windows, blowing up rooms, and killing their headmaster???  Harry isn't even immobilized by Dumbledore as he is in the book during the death scene, which prevents Harry from coming to his defense.  Instead they make out Harry to be a WIMP who stands around pacing while they kill his beloved headmaster.  Harry would have gotten himself killed in Dumbledore's defense if he had a chance...which was why the headmaster immobilized him with a spell to prevent that from happening!  They didn't even let poor Harry stun a single death eater during the entire chase off the school grounds.  In the book both Harry, his friends, and teachers put up a major fight.  Where was Bill Weasley who was brutally attacked, and Lupin and Tonks who also fought for the school?  A death eater was killed if my memory serves me right!  Harry left Ron, Hermione, and Ginny some of the luck potion, which is what protected them during the battle.  I could go on and on... but onto my next big beef with this film.

They completely skip the funeral!!!! Unbelievable, one of the most important characters dies and they just end the movie!  Why was everyone so calm at the sight of their dead headmaster?  I remember people in the book beside themselves with the pain of his loss.  And why on earth in all of the most emotional scenes do I never see a single tear drop down Daniel Radcliffe's face?  I swear his emotional scenes were completely lacking for me.  I wanted to see a real heart wrenching performance like I felt when reading the book.  And don't even get me started on how they gypped poor Fawkes....

A couple other things...Since when can Dumbledore apparate right into the school?  In the book he had to appear in Hogsmead on his return from the horcrux scene and TRAVEL to the school which already had the dark mark above it....ugh!!  Where on earth was Doby or Kreacher in this film? Considering what happens in the next book/film I think an appearance of Doby would have been justified.  These changes they made were simply unnecessary and serve no purpose other than to make the final film a joke with so much information incorrect or not covered.

I have put up with a lot adaptations from the books to the movies that were grossly changed, but this was simply unacceptable.  The battle they skipped over was extremely important and by skipping over it, and the funeral, they did a great disservice to the memory of Dumbledore.  Those scenes were extremely powerful and they turned it into something rated G (gutless) and ruined the film IMO.  At least an hour of all of the endless focus on the romance in this film could have been cut out to add more of the guts of the book onto the big screen.

The only shining light for me is Evanna Lynch who plays Luna.  I wish I had seen more of her in the film because I love the way she portrays Luna's character, who was one of my favorites from the books.  Oh...and I can't forget Warwick Davis whose character of Filius Flitwick I always look forward to seeing.

Hopefully this review will save a few people from paying good money to see a travesty of a great story.",1247616000,72,3808,4.4949053857350805
3276202,5,B000ZECQ08,"I am a huge Harry Potter fan and have watched every movie at least 3 times when it is first released.  This movie left me with no desire to really see the last movie.  I didn't feel there was as much action and suspense that I felt there should be.  The movie is good but not the best of the HP series.  I felt that they dealt too much with the romances and not as much with how they thought was the Half Blood Prince.

This movie was geared for the younger audience more then for those who have grown up reading the Harry Potter books.  The special extras on the DVD make the purchase of the movie worth while.",1242604800,2,611,4.05
3276203,5,B000ZECQ08,"I am, like many who look forward to another chapter in the Harry Potter adventures. I believe we all hope to see an accurate presentation of what we enjoyed so much in the book. Understanding we can't have a 6 hour movie, there will be some ""cutting"" involved. The author has done a superb job of character developement and created a very detailed world, and then, tells a story that enthralls me.
  She has done so in each book. No director, or writer should alter this ladies passionate excellence. Let the story be the story and tell it true to the book. I saw the books come alive in the J.R.R Tolkin series in a well presented true to the books film series that thrilled millions. Keep your fingers crossed.
