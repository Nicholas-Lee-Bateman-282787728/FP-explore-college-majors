8671290,5,B00MB6OSRW,"This is the definitive DVD release of Ed Wood's ""The Young Marrieds"", Wood's last film. This DVD release is 8 minutes longer for the aforementioned film, compared to another DVD release on a different label! Kudos to Dimitrios Otis for this definitive release, and his brilliant and informative liner notes included with this DVD release!",1421193600,9,338,5.163636363636364
8671291,4,B00MB6OSRW,"This triple treat of Ed Wood movies was released by After Hours Cinema.  ""Nympho Cycler"" (1971) is a poor quality print.  Given the source material, that's not surprising.  The Alpha Blue Archives edition starts with Casey Larrain (credited as Lorraine Casey) in a swimming pool, and Ed Wood sitting poolside. Ed is in drag, wearing a blonde wig and green dress. Ed announces that, ""After all, I am your husband,"" taking off his wig and dress, and joining Casey in the pool.  The After Hours Cinema version starts with Ed and Lorraine already in the pool.  Much of Ed and Lorraine's dialogue seems improvised, as they're laughing it up and kissing.  In a later scene, Ed is taking photographs of his wife for a men's magazine. That scene is very reminiscent of the movie ""Pretty Models All In A Row"" (1969). In that movie, Ed played a cross-dressing photographer, while Casey Larrain played one of the models. In this movie, Lorraine gets tired of Ed exploiting her as a model, and pimping her out to his friends.  She hits the road on her motorcycle, and experiences all sorts of sexual hijinks.  After less than an hour, the movie ends, without Ed Wood making a return appearance.  There's very little of the quirky dialogue that Ed Wood was famous for.

Alice Friedland stars in ""The Young Marrieds"" (1971).  The movie was written by Ed Wood, was the last film that Ed Wood directed, and has been lost for over forty years. The video quality is fair, especially considering the source material.  It's a standard, hardcore porno movie, with occasional narration.  Alice plays a wife whose husband is not sexually satisfied. They go to a swingers' party with two other couples.  Alice's husband eagerly has sex with a bleached-blonde woman.  Alice is reluctant at first, but soon enough is joining in on the fun.  As the orgy intensifies, the movie ends, clocking in at less than an hour.  Again, there's very little of the quirky dialogue that Ed Wood was famous for.  Despite its flaws, it's always a cause for celebration when a lost Ed Wood film has been found, and released on DVD.  The theatrical trailer for ""The Young Marrieds"" is included as a bonus feature, and is not available in the Alpha Blue Archives edition.  According to the informative liner notes, there is some doubt about Ed Wood's involvement with the adult movie ""Shot On Location,"" which was released in January of 1972.  Its movie-within-a-movie, quirky dialogue, and surprise ending, are in the style of Ed Wood, at the very least.  This After Hours Cinema release is a worthwhile purchase for hard core Ed Wood fans like me.",1419552000,13,2603,4.763392857142857
8671292,3,B00MB6OSRW,"After Hours Cinema is one of a group of DVD authoring outfits that appears to be making it their mission to re-acquaint the modern world with the 'joys' of 70's vintage sex flix.  While many of their releases are pretty esoteric in their appeal - THIS collection which purports to provide the viewer with 3 examples of hard-core smut by the legendary Ed Wood would likely garner broader attention simply because of Wood's name and reputation. Looking beyond how 'authentic' these Wood-works might be and/or how much one sees of Wood in the films - how does this package stack up as a work of porn artfulness?!

Well, as one might expect from the Director of what is commonly acknowledged to be one of the 'worst movies ever made' - they're pretty awful. IF the ""Ed Wood' factor was removed from the equation this trio of low budget sex romps would not likely raise an eyebrow of interest from anyone other than those die-hard devotees of 70's period porno - endless examples of similar sinema 'trash' are to be found in the vaults of distributors such as 'Something Weird Cinema' and the ""Alpha Blue Archive"".

Physically speaking - the quality of the film transfers is pretty good - considering the relatively horrible quality of the source material.  This IS classic grindhouse fare and features all the imperfections one has come to expect from that genre: degraded film stock - massive color shifts - poor sound - inexplicable editing... it's all there to be 'enjoyed'. What sorta sets these flix apart, and would seem to identify them as products of Ed Wood's fevered cinema genius, might be the 'scripting'.  One of the more endearing aspects of Wood's stylings is his earnestness in trying to deliver a 'meaningful' film experience - even when the base-line is just a bunch of XXX humping.  This collection contains some hilarious examples of Wood's tendency to 'purple prose' which does much to lift the product above the mundanity of countless other similar cheap sex flix.

Of the 3 offerings, ""The Young Marrieds"" provides the most 'hard-core' XXX action. A simple tale about a guy and his wife - he wishes that his mate would be a little less inhibited (like the strippers he stops in to watch every day after work!) and, after a series of fairly low-key connubial sex scenes, he ultimately convinces his up-tight wife to attend a swingers party where things actually go a little beyond what the young husband is ready to accept into his own sexual realm!  Lotsa 'hair' (everywhere) and gynacological close-up action to be appreciated in this one - the opening and closing sequences of the 'eternal ocean' gives Wood an opportunity to wax philosophical about 'man's condition'- CLASSIC!

""Nympho Cycler"" features a pretty cute girl who is being 'pimped out' by a photographer character (played by Wood himself) until she gets tired of that schtick, hops on her motorcyle, and heads off looking for fun & adventure.  What she finds are: some lesbian hook-ups and a roll in the grass with another bike-riding adventurer - a Nordic sailor whose 'ship is in' in L.A. - they form a bit of a union until meeting a rather abrupt and unexpectedly violent ending. While this is definitely a 'sex flik' - there is not as much XXX material and some poor camera angles suck much of the heat out of most of the carnal action. Again, there are some bits of amusing dialogue that are decidedly Wood-ian, and there's some cool 60's pop inspired jazz music in the soundtrak on this one.

""Shot On Location"" has a bit of the 'film within a film' premise - as a nudey Western is being produced throughout the story line and 'we' follow the various participants as they become involved in the making of the movie (including a classic 'casting couch' scene w/ a '14 yr old' starlette wannabe). Wood appears minimally in a couple of scenes - acting as the Director of the bent cowboy drama.  The females in this film are all fairly attractive - a stand-out being 70's porn hottie Rene Bond - but Ms Bond never actually gets naked in this one! Lotsa nudity and enthusiastic simulated screwing by the other libidinous cast members, but (again) it doesn't provide much truly hard-core action.

All in all - a pretty decent 3 film package.  Other reviewers have mentioned possible substantial 'cuts' to the films - but, for my money, they were plenty LONG enuf!  Personally, I enjoyed this little taste of X-Rated Ed Wood and would recommend it - knowing full well that itz gonna be pretty lame.
Minimal 'extras' on the disk - but there is a nice little booklet of background info included in the box case.",1418774400,7,4592,4.729662077596997
8671293,1,B00MB6OSRW,"Every now and then, I check the internets for new findings in the seemingly endless depths of Ed Wood ephemera.  Since Rudolph Grey first published the reigning authority on all things Wood, ""Nightmare in Ecstasy"", many new discoveries have been unearthed, broadening our understanding of the works of Hollywood's most lovable loser.  As the Tim Burton biopic ignores Ed's forays into adult entertainment entirely (a period of his life which I still maintain deserves its own treatment; think ""Boogie Nights"" meets ""Leaving Las Vegas"" starring Randy Quaid), his efforts in smut films and literature remain largely detached from the legend. To obsessive completists like myself, this only makes us naturally more consumed with studying this side of Wood further.

So, last summer, when I learned of the newly released ""Young Marrieds"", a long-presumed lost film and currently considered Ed Wood's final directorial effort, I was excited.  Even better, an on-screen Wood sighting in the newly-found ""Nympho Cycler"" was too irresistible to ignore.  As I prepared to order the Alpha Blue editions of these films, I caught notice of this release, which had not only the aforementioned two rarities but a THIRD unheard of Wood-related film, ""Shot On Location"" in one package.  Being the completist I am, I opted to pre-order this version from After Hours Cinema back in August. So, patiently I waited...

What I got was beyond disappointing on all fronts.  Firstly, though ""Nympho Cycler"" was unfinished to begin with, the version on this disc cuts at least 15 minutes out from what is left, including a good portion of one of Ed Wood's scenes (where he is in drag).  It eliminates the title credits as well as the theme song (which can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MKq73dap1k), and who knows what else.  Even more infuriating, though, was the deliberate misrepresentation of the third ""feature"", ""Shot On Location"". The item description on Amazon currently reads as such:

""This one-of-a-king collection also includes Ed Wood on-screen in Nympho Cycler and Shot on Location.""

Similar sentiments were expressed in other advance notices of this release, suggesting Wood appears in BOTH films. Not the case.  In fact, the liner notes, which make no mention of ""Nympho Cycler"" at all, even though it would be a great opportunity to clarify that it is in all likelihood an alternate title for Joseph Robertson's elusive ""Misty"" referenced in ""Nightmare in Ecstasy"". Instead, a couple pages are devoted to justifying that ""Shot On Location"" is included because it MIGHT have been written by Wood.  Though several actors associated with other Wood productions of this era (Rene Bond, Rick Lutze, Casey Lorrain), the evidence is flimsy that Wood did much more than contribute to the script without credit.  The only bonuses on the disc are a trailer for ""The Young Marrieds"" and several others for Carter Stevens films.  Personally, I would have preferred  using the disc space for a more complete version of ""Nympho Cycler""/""Misty.""

Sub-par release.  Huge disappointment.  Spend a couple bucks more for the separate Alpha Blue editions.",1416873600,37,3145,5.227091633466135
