I am a professional in this field and I testify in court as an expert witness on these cases, and this curriculum is very informative and to the point. It truly represents the reality of what we see in our field and how children are manipulated by their offender. I HIGHLY recommend this curriculum if you are looking to add a child abuse training program. People really understand this information better and get a better sense of reality and how important it is to protect children. This is a must buy!",1433808000,2,610,4.710280373831775
