8155120,5,B000K8H4LA,"We have precious little Bird, Trane and Pres on film; a national treasure lost forever. But thanks to this wonderful DVD, we can actually hear and SEE the great Heath Brothers playing live. And these guys can talk as well as they play. Their stories and anecdotes--told with inimitable style--will keep you spellbound. The music itself is  well recorded and includes a gorgeous--and rare--cello solo by Percy Heath.

Cameos by Sonny Rollins and Herbie Hancock plus clips of Bird and Diz add  essential historical context. This is a must-own for any serious jazz fan.",1167696000,6,566,5.0
