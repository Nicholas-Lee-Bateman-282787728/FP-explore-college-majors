8267048,4,B0017S48UC,"I purchased this video (my first on keeping) to help my 9 year old who loves Keeping.  This video takes you slowely through multiple basic skills such as stops, throws, coming out of the goal and the ready position so it doesn't captivate the young viewer (thus the boring review by another - no glitz).  I am a non-coach parent just helping and this got me through the basics with my kid. Now I am using drills and skills provided in this video to coach 3 other 9 year olds on the team who are interested in Keeping but have not had any coaching.",1302393600,2,547,4.25
