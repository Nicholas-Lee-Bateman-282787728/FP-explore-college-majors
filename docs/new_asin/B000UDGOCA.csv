2920369,5,B000UDGOCA,"This show was run for 3 weeks by CBS before being cancelled.  The problem was that CBS didn't explain how the show worked.  The show interviews ordinary people about ordinary topics.  The show then put their ordinary words into the mouths of animated animals in funny situations.  Unless you understand that, you think it is just bad professional writing. Example:  A wife says that her husband eats too fast and never talks during meals.  The video shows two boa constrictors, one saying the words and the other with a rat half in his mouth, snake-gorging style.  That's the humor.  Their web page is still open if you want a taste.",1194912000,3,633,4.6909090909090905
2920370,5,B000UDGOCA,"I saw the (too few) episodes that CBS aired and immediately was hooked on this brilliant production.  Normal, everyday Americans were interviewed on a variety of topics (yes, mostly adult subject matter) and the audio from those interviews were then used to build the claymation around using animals.  The end result = brilliance!

Unfortunately, the majority of Americans just did not get it... at least that what CBS thought, so they cancelled the show with at least four other completed episodes to air.

Thank goodness for this DVD.  All seven episodes are there.

From the creative, intelligent minds of Aardman that brought you Wallace & Gromit; Chicken Run, and the Chevron TV ads is this artistic and comedic jewel.

Well worth every penny.",1194220800,6,748,5.032520325203252
2920371,5,B000UDGOCA,"I came to this American version already a fan of the original Nick Park short and the BBC series, so I knew pretty much what to expect.  What surprised me, though, was just how much funnier this American series seemed to me than the BBC version!  I'm a long-time fan of British comedy (everything from Fawlty Towers to Monty Python to Spaced to Mr. Bean to The Office), but for some reason this American edition just kept me laughing the entire time, whereas the British version had more spaced out laughs.

Intact in this version are the hilarious sight-gags in the background, the delightful design of the animals, and the hilarious juxtaposition of human responses coupled with non-human settings.

I watched both of the episodes as they aired, and was so disappointed to hear that the series had been canceled immediately thereafter.  I was very surprised, actually, because a lot of my friends had watched the show on their own and loved it just as much as I had.  I don't know if they didn't advertise it enough or what, but everyone I showed it too later thought it was great, so I wish they'd given it more of a chance.  Oh well.

I'm glad they at least put the whole season out on DVD.  This will make a good present for many family members and friends this year for Christmas.",1192665600,15,1286,4.532467532467533
2920372,5,B000UDGOCA,"I totally agree with Griffin on this one. This show is so great! It is too bad that the American public is so interested in ""reality"" shows and garbage of that nature, that they didn't give a show like this a chance. This is REAL reality! People talking about real things! Plus, all done up in an awesome animation style as well. I highly recommend getting this DVD as well as the British versions of this show. There are just so many good moments in these shows, funny ones as well as tender. My most favorite moment is the first scene when two guys are heard talking about ""wine"" but then cut to the animation and... well, I won't tell you. You will just have to BUY THIS DVD!!!!!",1191974400,8,682,4.294573643410852
2920373,5,B000UDGOCA,I absoulutely loved this show!  Too bad the American public didn't give it a chance.  It was a very smartly done show with so much humor!  That is the way with so many great comedies.  If it isn't about sex it just doesn't sell--and I am NOT a prude.  But I do like to be able to watch a show with my 75 year old Mom and not be horrified by the content.  Thanks for putting this on DVD.,1189987200,2,386,3.8227848101265822
2920374,5,B000UDGOCA,"One evening while surfing the channels on my television, I stumbled on an episode of this show of ""Creature Comforts America"".  Being an extreme fan of the British version of this program, I came to a stop ending my channel surfing for a time.  As a previous reviewer on this board so succinctly wrote, these are NOT really cartoons for the kids; however, they are very funny Claymation cartoons really for GROWNUPS!  In this American version, the creatures have wonderfully varying American accents that are hysterical plus they are being asked questions that could be considered more relevant to our country or more particularly ""American"" questions--some being taken from the news in the USA.  I particularly love the Claymation character of the snake that has just swallowed the cat along with the horny panda bears--all are hysterical.  I am just so very glad that they have released season one on DVD and I am also so very sad that there won't be anymore releases due to the show's cancellation because it is indeed so very funny.",1187827200,16,1036,4.863636363636363
2920375,5,B000UDGOCA,"""Creature Comforts"" comes from the same company that produces the wonderful claymation ""Wallace & Gromit"" shorts and movies like ""Chicken Run."" Episodes consisted of scenes of claymation animals speaking with the voices of regular people talking about their everyday lives.

A British version has become very popular in the UK but unfortunately the American version just didn't catch on. CBS pulled the series after only three weeks on the air due to low ratings.

Why? The show wasn't really intended for kids and I suspect many adults didn't watch it because they thought that it was for children. A producer on the series also shared with me that the length of the show (30 minutes) might have been a problem. The UK episodes are about 10 minutes long which may be the ideal length for something like this.

The project took months and months to complete so it's nice that the fans and general public will now have a chance to see all seven episodes.",1186358400,24,953,4.763636363636364

2920386,5,B000UDGOCA,"This is hilarious, a good time, for certain!!! I've watched it over and over again, and haven't tired of it yet. My only complaint is there is isn't a Second Season. I loved this when it was on network TV, and I am so happy, I can play it any time I wish. I have to recommend this, to every one. Disc two, has outtakes and alternate takes. Well worth the price. Loved it!!!",1431043200,,373,4.054054054054054

2920392,5,B000UDGOCA,I think I own all of the DVDs in the Creature Comforts series - I even have the PSP UMD version of one of them. Anytime I need a good laugh I play these videos. The season 1 of the American edition of the show is one of the funniest of the bunch. I love how the animators interpreted the interviews. I wish the series had not been canceled. Highly recommend this DVD set to everyone regardless of age - young or old would get a kick out of them.,1412899200,,445,3.9555555555555557

2920396,5,B000UDGOCA,This dvd makes me laugh.  The voices are actually recorded interviews with people but used as the voices for the cartoon animals and it is very clever.,1402012800,,151,4.592592592592593

2920398,2,B000UDGOCA,"Very trashy compared to the British series. The language and subject matter were horrible for family entertainment. It's clear they just wanted to portray Americans as witless, swearing neanderthals. They were likely going after the late night audience but even then it was just poorly done. Very disappointing! British series is a million times better!",1395878400,2,353,5.4363636363636365
2920399,4,B000UDGOCA,"You will really have fun watching this series!  It is truly a labor of love by the creators who also made ""Wallace & Gromit""!  It is so funny, smart & sweet that you will watch it again & again!",1394841600,,194,3.948717948717949
2920400,5,B000UDGOCA,Enjoyable DVD of the American version of the English creature comforts show.  The clay animation is great and fun to watch.  Don't forget to watch the background to see what else goes on.  If you enjoyed the English creature comforts you'll enjoy this one too.,1392336000,,260,4.733333333333333
2920401,5,B000UDGOCA,"Taking recorded voices of typical (and sometimes low class) Americans, then applying claymation cortoons to fit is inspired and the results are very funny.  This is adult humor but kids will love it too.",1387756800,,203,4.970588235294118
2920402,5,B000UDGOCA,This show is so funny. Somehow my bf and I stumbled across this on netflix. It was really funny to watch together. I'm suprised they only made one season. I'm going to suggest this show to all my friends ha. Hopefully they make another season. This show is really funny to watch with your bestfriend/ significant other,1384041600,,318,4.5964912280701755
2920403,5,B000UDGOCA,"Everything about this series is fun and silly. I have given it as a gift 4 times, and nothing says a product is awesome like giving it to people over and over. In fact, I honestly feel that this is what really broke the ice between my mother in law and me, we bonded over its awesome humor. Also look up the UK version, it is equally, if not more, incredible.",1383350400,,359,4.070422535211268

2920408,4,B000UDGOCA,"If you saw it when it was on and liked it, even if only one episode, then I guess you would like the rest of them.  I found these shows to be fun and creative although a little weird at times.",1363046400,,192,3.682926829268293
2920409,5,B000UDGOCA,This show was only televised for several episodes.  So funny. I can watch over and over.  Perfect animals for the voices.  Love and miss this show.  Somehow the British version just isn't the same.,1359417600,,197,4.705882352941177
2920410,3,B000UDGOCA,"This American version of Creature Comforts has some funny spots here and there, but doesn't compare to the English version. I would skip this one and buy the other. I must say, I bought this version in error. It wasn't exactly clear to me which version I was getting.",1358208000,,267,4.469387755102041
2920411,5,B000UDGOCA,I love the original Creature Comforts series and was thrilled to find the entire (un-aired) America series for sale! I only wish the series had been more popular state-side.,1357948800,,173,5.0
2920412,4,B000UDGOCA,"This was a fantastic show, that just couldn't find an audience. Unique concepts like this don't always work, but this one did. Shame on CBS for not giving it more of a chance.

My rating of a 4 is because of the special features. Those included are fine, but there are many more that should have been added. Some can be viewed on Y**T***, and were available when Creature Comforts had a full website. Considering the show only lasted seven episodes, they should have made everything available on this disc set.

The feature most missed by me, were videos of the actual interviewees. To put human faces to the voices connected with horses, rats, and chickens, is a blast.",1325376000,,670,4.621848739495798
2920413,5,B000UDGOCA,This show is sooooooo funny! My friends and I found it on Netflix one night and watched it a few times. I loved it so much I had to order it to add to my collection. The characters they put to these interviews are just ridiculous! So random and hilarious. I can't wait to share it with more people!,1300838400,,298,4.067796610169491
2920414,2,B000UDGOCA,"I like this type of animation, especially the way Wallace and Gromit does
it...so when i saw creature comforts i taught it would be the same type
of interesting stories and characters...NOT.
  Ive seen half of season 1 and i think the rest will be the same:
Animals complaining and talking about themselves and the subject depends
on the surrounding themes.  Looks like 5-10 sets per episodes, and they
switch back and forth with the animal interviews.... with minimum movements they yap away....blah blah blah........i was not impressed.",1248220800,,538,5.090909090909091
2920415,4,B000UDGOCA,"I like the Brithish version, which was the first to come out. However, the American version is much better and I can't wait for a second season.",1246838400,,144,4.37037037037037
2920416,5,B000UDGOCA,"Creature Comforts America is hilarious! I had only seen a few episodes on TV and thought they were funny. I had no idea the series was on video. Although young viewers may not get a lot of the humor, many of us who are more mature with broader experiences should get a really big kick in the pants out of this. I have not viewed the British version yet, but can't wait. I would highly recommend this video.",1222819200,,406,4.217948717948718
2920417,4,B000UDGOCA,"I happened to come across Creature Comforts America on a British Airways flight back to London - it was being screened as part of the inflight entertainment.

I'm sad to read it wasn't successful in the US as I thought it gave a brief but fascinating insight into the lives and thoughts of ordinary, every day Americans.

The subtle (and hilarious) expressions on each of the animals are a work of art; I found myself becoming somewhat attached to certain charaters - the cockroaches, the Sharks, the Hippo and the couple of cats on the couch. Oh, and who could forget the simple but genuine mother & daughter pigs.

A shame no future episodes are planned ... I will miss the series.

2920419,5,B000UDGOCA,"I highly recommend Creature Comforts America. If you have seen the British
version, you will possibly like this even more. If you are not familiar with
the British version, the same folks who made Chicken Run and Wallace and
Gromit made this series. People on the street (Americans for the American
version, Brits for the British one) are asked questions and their responses
are put in the mouths of claymation animals. The end result is very witty,
and there are frequently things happening in the background that are noticed
on multiple viewings that add to the humor. This series was on American
television for all of three weeks, but this is the whole season's worth.
Great stuff! Under appreciated by the networks, I highly recommend it.",1211587200,,742,4.896825396825397

2920424,5,B000UDGOCA,"I watched the original DVD set featuring claymation animals with British accents, and it was OK... but what makes the American edition hilarious is that some of us know people who actually talk like the animals in it. The little bird who talked like a Sixties hippie, the two lobsters with Yiddish accents, and the tapir who could barely understand English (I'm not kidding, my boss and I actually nicknamed his assistant ""Fuse"" after watching the tapir), all sound like people I've met. The frustrated gorilla, however, was the crowning touch. DO get this DVD, it will make you laugh.",1196985600,2,585,4.86
