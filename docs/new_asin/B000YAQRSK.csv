8231653,5,B000YAQRSK,"Romain Gary wrote Promise at Dawn about growing up in Russia with an over-the-top mother who was an actress.  The son becomes an aviator and falls in love.  This book was adapted into a play for Broadway by Samuel Taylor, who had written Sabrina Fair (that became the Audrey Hepburn film Sabrina.)  I saw the play in 1960.  Hugh O'Brien, fresh from years of playing Wyatt Earp on a TV series, starred as the son.  Elizabeth Bergner played the mother but quit the show in Boston, and in New York Lily Darvis took over the role.  She was the widow of the famed Hungarian playwright Ferenc Molnar.  The play was directed by Alfred Lunt.  I enjoyed the play although it flopped.  Ten years later Jules Dassin made a film version with his wife  Melina Mercouri as the mother.  The son was played by Assaf Davan, whose father was prime minister of Israel at the time.  A dashing handsome young actor.  In 1960 Dassin had made Never on Sunday with Melina, an international hit, but they were not so lucky with Promise at Dawn, although I loved the film.  There was a VHS version probably in the 1980s, currently unavailable on amazon.  I'm hoping that a DVD version will be released.  It's a marvelous little gem of a film, brilliantly acted and directed and it's a film that should not be forgotten.",1397347200,3,1293,4.532467532467533
