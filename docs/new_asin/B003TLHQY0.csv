8405206,4,B003TLHQY0,"Old western with little known names, at the time anyway.  Oh theres issues with it but over all ""Journey to Shiloh"" is a movie worth watching.  No forced emotions, no timeline to follow, California can not double as the deep south where the action mostly takes place.  Just a story of seven kids wanting to do their part.  Theres a similar story that could be told today with out youth going off to a way they don't understand.  Seemed like the patriotic thing to do, until it gets real and friends start dying for nothing any of them can really put a finger on.  Its a movie.  I lets the time pass at 0200hrs when a body is alone.  When it's all said and done, it font mean nothin'.",1501977600,,683,4.24031007751938
8405207,4,B003TLHQY0,"""Journey to Shiloh"" (1968) details the story of seven youths from Concho County in near-West Texas who travel across the Mississippi to join the Confederate Army and kick some Yankee arse. While they intend to ride to Richmond, Virginia, they end up hooking up with Braxton Bragg's Gulf Coast outfit and fighting in Shiloh, Tennessee. The male ingnues learn a lot on their long journey and their introduction to soldiering and war. Who lives and who dies?

James Caan plays the main protagonist, ""Captain"" Buck Burnett, while the other six ""teens"" (all well into their 20s) are Michael Sarrazin, Don Stroud, Jan-Michael Vincent, Michael Burns, Paul Petersen and, believe it or not Harrison Ford, a full nine years before his breakthrough with Star Wars, but don't get too excited as he gets the least screen time of the bunch.

On the downside, Universal was huge on TV movies at the time and so ""Journey to Shiloh""  looks like a TV movie; in fact, it was directed by one of their TV movie directors. So don't expect the cinematic scope of contemporaneous Westerns, like ""Duel at Diablo,"" ""Bandolero!,"" ""Hang `Em High"" and ""Shalako."" It looks serviceable, but also phony and stale. A big part of the phoniness is due to the fake Southern countryside, as the movie was shot in Agoura and Thousand Oaks, California, but takes place in East Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee and adjoining regions. No matter how you slice it, California doesn't look like the deep South, not to mention the studio sets. Another issue is the movie's cartoony vibe. Things that would ordinarily take much longer occur with the quickness of a comic book.

Despite these glaring flaws, I found myself ignoring them in favor of the story, particularly as it moved along. You feel like you get to know most of the gang by the end of the movie, Harrison's character being the biggest exception. The ""boys"" grow from wide eyed youngsters to hardened men over the course of the movie, the biggest rude awakening of course being their baptism into soldiering and war.

Speaking of which, I really enjoyed the last third of the film that involves the youths joining up with Bragg's brigade, the ensuing warfare, deaths, injuries, possible desertion and aftermath. Although decidedly comic booky the movie offers a unique glimpse of being a Confederate soldier.

The film features no less than four beauties, albeit all relatively short roles: Tisha Sterling as Airybelle Sumner; the un-credited Susanne Benton as the blond saloon girl, Lucy; Brenda Scott as the brunette saloon girl who falls for Buck; and a nurse (Eileen Wesson).

FINAL WORD: Someone criticized ""Journey to Shiloh"" for its obvious low-budgeted faults by pointing out that it's no ""Magnificent Seven"" or ""The Wild Bunch."" While this may be technically true I found myself enjoying ""Journey to Shiloh"" more than these heralded Westerns. Yes, the movie has the unmistakable gloss of one of Universal's factory-made television movies, but it's strong in characters and story, cartoony or not. This is likely because the movie's based on Henry Wilson Allen's excellent novel (aka Will Henry). Some call it an ""anti-war movie,"" but this isn't really true; it's simply a ""showing-soldiering-and-war-the-way-it-really-was"" movie.

The film runs 101 minutes.

8405208,1,B003TLHQY0,It is rare that I cannot find anything good to say about a movie.  I guess that makes this a rare movie.  Even John Doucette as Gen Bragg didn't seem to be acting up to his ability.  The story line was ridiculous. The ladies hairdos were ridiculous. Every one except one gets killed and he gets maimed.

8405209,3,B003TLHQY0,"Somewhere in this 1968 civil war western there's a well-written and poignant story trying to get clear. Perhaps in the right hands, with a bigger budget, and a bit more running time, this could have been a minor classic. As it is, we've got the ex-TV producers of `Wagon Train' and `Laredo' casting a virtually unknown James Caan (in a very dodgy wig) leading a bunch of youngish stars-in waiting (including Harrison Ford) through a rather unevenly paced and episodic tale largely played out on the Universal backlot. The characters don't seem quite as young and innocent as the script suggests, nor are they developed enough for us to fully empathise with them before they meet their often abrupt ends. Once the widescreen titles are over, the DVD infuriatingly goes into full-frame. This loses the impact of some lovely sweeping scenery at the beginning, though as the film progresses; it gives way to lots of very obvious studio `exteriors'. The civil war battle scenes come courtesy of `Shenandoah' and are ill matched to the studio scenes.  `Journey to Shiloh' is worth a look and its certainly a bit more ambitious than the other westerns that Universal was turning out in the late sixties. I'd like to see a remake done with a bit more sensitivity...",1320364800,6,1257,4.846511627906977
8405210,2,B003TLHQY0,"""Journey to Shiloh"" is a western that came out in 1968 and hence, reflected the anti-war sentiment that was prominent at the time. The film is populated with a lot of ""young guns"" and was designed to appeal to the youth culture that was preeminent in the late 60s. Thus we don't have John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart, Randolph Scott, Burt Lancaster, or the usual establishment western stars. Instead we have James Caan, Harrison Ford, Don Stroud, Jan Michael Vincent, Michael Sarrazin, James Gammon, etc. These young guns are called ""boys"" in the film, but the truth is they were all in the mid to late 20s at the time.

As an anti-war western, this film belongs to the ""Who's Gonna Get it Next"" genre (""Bite the Bullet"" has a similar motif). The seven young guns set off from Texas to join their comrades who are fighting in Virginia, but one by one they meet their fates -

* Shot dead in a crooked card game
* Died from pneumonia
* Gut shot during battle
* Blown up by a mortar
* Hit with a miniball between the eyes
* Shot as a deserter

Unfortunately for the film, two meet their fates off screen.

James Caan (1940) is the leader of the group. He is best known as Sonny Corleone, the role for which he received an Oscar nomination in 1973. Over more than 100 roles he's been nominated for a Golden Globe 4 times and for an Emmy once. From 2003 to 2007 he had his own TV series, ""Las Vegas"".

Harrison Ford (1942) has a small part. Ford, of course, is now a film icon, having starred in some of the highest box office films in history. He was nominated once for an Oscar (""Witness"") in 1985

Baby-face Jan Michael Vincent (1944) was a big hit in the 70s with films like ""Tribes"" (1970), ""The Mechanic"" (1972), and ""White Line Fever"" (1975). He had a TV series (""Airwolf"") from 1984-7. In 1996 he was seriously injured in an auto accident and his career slowed. This was his second film.

Tough Don Stroud (1943) alternated between film and TV. His notable film roles include the villain in ""Joe Kidd"" (1972), the murderer in ""Coogan's Bluff"" (1968), and Gary Busey's buddy in ""The Buddy Holly Story"" (1978).

Wide eyed Michael Sarrazin (1940-2011) was nominated for a BAFTA for ""They Shoot Horses, Don't They?"" and a Golden Globe for ""The Sweet Ride"" (1968). I remember him best as one of the sons in ""Sometimes a Great Notion"" (1970).

Gruff looking and sounding James Gammon (1940-2010) made more than 100 films between 1966 and 2009. He's probably best known as Don Johnson's father from the TV series ""Nash Bridges"" (1996-2001) and as the Manager from ""Major League"" (1989).

The boys are offset with a few older guys like Noah Beery Jr., and John Doucette.

John Doucette's chubby face and heavy set frame are familiar to everyone from his 200+ films, usually as a heavy. He was distinguished by his husky voice and being the fastest draw in Hollywood. He was equally at home in film and on TV and was comfortable in Westerns as well as biblical epics. Doucette plays a Confederate General.

Noah Beery Jr. (1913-94) was the son of silent film star Noah Beery and nephew of 30s mega star Wallace Beery. He made more than 100 films but is probably best remembered for his roles on TV as James Garner's father in ""Rockford Files"" (1974-80) and Uncle Joey in ""Circus Boy"" (1956-7). Beery plays a Confederate Sergeant.

The film is directed by William Hale (1940) who was primarily a TV director. He started in TV with the Cheyenne series (1955) and did several more western series (e.g., ""The Virginian"", ""Lancer"")

Westerns were not in vogue in 1968. The big box office winners were ""Funny Girl"", ""2001"", ""Bullitt"", ""Romeo and Juliette"", and ""Rosemary's Baby"". The big Oscar winner was ""Oliver"" (Picture, Director) and ""Charly"" (Actor) and ""The Lion in Winter"" (Actress) each won one. Other notable releases that year were ""Planet of the Apes"", ""Barbarella"", ""Funny Girl"", ""Monterey Pop"", ""The Producers"", ""The Thomas Crown Affair"", and ""The Odd Couple"". A few westerns appeared - Jimmy Stewart in ""Bandolero"" and ""Firecreek"", Glenn Ford in ""Day of the Evil Gun"", Clint Eastwood in ""Hang Em High"". Burt Lancaster in ""The Scalphunters"", and Charlton Heston in ""Will Penny"".

This film is interesting as an anti-war western, but otherwise it is a less than average B western. Examples of anti-war westerns that are better films include ""Drums Along the Mohawk"" (1939), ""Fort Apache"" (1948), ""Cheyenne Autumn"" (1964), and the very best anti-war western -""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" (1976).",1305849600,10,4484,4.708812260536399
