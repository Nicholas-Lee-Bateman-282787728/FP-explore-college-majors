1352569,5,B00004TS0J,"Forget Omen 4 the Awakening, it dosen't even belong in the original set  and story.  Omen 4 is absolute made for tv fodder compared to it's  predecessors, but it's still part of the set.  I guess!  The omen follows  the rise and eventual downfall of the anti-christ, in the biblical sense.  But not really a religious type movie as (THE OMEGA CODE).  With graphic  violence, nudity(THE FINAL CONFLICT), and some foul words about God, The  Omen films are simply not for everyone.
The acting in the firt two THE  OMEN, and DAMIEN OMEN 2, is superb, Gregory Peck, Lee Remick, and William  Holden, are perfectly cast as well as could be.  The Story is totally  engrossing, makeing it seem very plausable that this is really happening in  the world today.  Or will happen.
What I really don't understand is the  story line from Omen 3 The Final Conflict.  The first two followed the  biblical sense almost to the letter or verse for that matter, but Final  Conflict dosen't, which throws the story of the first two off a bit and  dosen't follow the biblical aspect as well.  But the first two have earned  a place in my opinion as probably the two best horror films ever created.  It's hard for a horror picture then or today to compare to the harrowing  score of Jerry Goldsmith, and the absolute most frightning scene ever  filmed,(when Gregory Peck, and photographer David Warner discover what  happened to Peck's real infant, and at the same time discover who Damien's  real mother was).  Never the less if you are easily frightned, it would be  good advise not to watch these films alone.",968976000,2,1588,4.648550724637682
1352570,5,B00004TS0J,"After watching the trilogy on video years ago, i was very happy to hear  that it would released on DVD. And now i have watched the DVD versions of  all 4 movies,i become much more happier!!! What a great collection! Nice  packaging,good sound and vision quality and a lot of great extra's on part  1. From start to finish it are all chilling and thrilling movies,they don't  make them anymore like this!! You can follow Damien from Birth to his  death. And i think this trilogy ( i know there is a part 4, but i don't  think that this part can't beat up against the first three) is one of the  best trilogy ever made in the horror genre, better than the Exorcist  trilogy in mine opinion. If you like great horror movies than this  collection is a must!!!!! BUY IT!!!!!",968889600,4,769,4.352112676056338

1352573,5,B00004TS0J,For every Horror film buff!!! These movies are from the time that stories  were scarey and didn't rely on special effects to cover poor writing  skills. I was a kid when I saw the first three films and can still remember  the exhialrating rush of being shocked.  The last film is made for TV and  it shows.  I intend to buy this set just for the trilogy.,968112000,3,354,4.208955223880597

Also, this set included Omen 4 (shown only on TV) which is not great, but  hey, it completes the collection. ;)  Two thumbs up!",960854400,11,344,4.104477611940299
1352576,5,B00004TS0J,AWESOME MOVIE,1517702400,,13,6.0
1352577,4,B00004TS0J,"Movie 1 of 1976 and 32 overall in my journey through films of my lifetime.

I begun 1976 with ""The Omen"" because it interested me the most. That's not to say that I had high expectations. In fact, I was more interested in it than ""Taxi Driver."" I stated earlier that I have a prejudice against 70's movies. Well, once again, I'm finding my prejudice proven false. I found ""The Omen"" to be a pleasure to watch. I have also noticed an evolution in the quality in film making in just a few short years. Much improved sound effects, music, direction, film stock quality, etc.
I have certain directors that I believe are utilitarian in their approach. They are going to give you a good story and a very smooth viewing experience. Rob Reiner would be a good example of this. Another reason I was most interested in ""The Omen"" above other films from this year was Richard Donner. I have to say that he has proven to me at this point that he had some serious skill at story telling. As of this review he is retired and will be missed. There are few now remaining with his skill.
There is one thing that keeps me from giving this 5 stars: some cheesy moments. I'm not sure how they played to 70's audiences but to me they were laugh inducing. Enjoyable but cheesy just the same. As an example there is a series of family pictures at the beginning that are supposed to make the audience feel for this nuclear family in its infancy. It doesn't work. It's too heavy handed. There are other moments like that throughout the movie that don't hurt the movie as a work of entertainment but keep it from a truly brilliant masterpiece.
Perhaps a problem with many horror films is lack of subtlety.
The nanny  killing herself was shocking and unexpected.  Steven King in his book ""Dance Macabre"" have three tiers to horror: Terror, horror, and disgust. I'm not actually sure that these are comprehensive. If not I'd add one: Shock. This beginning, with its juxtaposition of the kid's party and its music, is a killer (pardon the pun) opening.
A natural limitation to horror films is that you are requested with a God's eye view intact by the nature of the fact that you know it's a horror film going in. This makes the character's seem oblivious and dense. ""The Omen"" really struggles here. In one scene the mother, whom is established as over protective, is bruised from an assault from Damien while she insists everything is just fine with the child. The father (Peck) comes off as almost a dullard as he accepts this interpretation from the battered woman who was in the process of disguising her wound with makeup. It's a strong effort to show these parents in a state of denial and with good reason. That not withstanding,  it cannot cover how silly and pathetic they seem; they are a horror trope, hopeless constituents of a natural limitation of the genre.
I suppose it's generational but I can't help but laugh at a lot of the most terrifying scenes. In the midst of it I see Donner's deft hand at work but I still can't help it. When religious icons are brought up it ramps up the camp level for me. Now I'm still not grading on a curve but despite that I'm enjoying every bit of this. I'm not thinking ""at the time this was made this was original and scarry"" I have no idea if that's true anyway. Judging this as a stand alone film, on its own merits I find it to be very good, despite my ironic laughter. And I find it good for the right reasons. It has tension, it is a scary film. I'm not saying that it is scaring me in all honesty but I can appreciate that it is nonetheless.
I suppose younger actors would have been more appropriate for the main parts. I hate that movies today feature almost exclusively young actors but their nieve approach to life would have hit the right tone for this. Regardless, this is a great movie and I'm glad my prejudices didn't keep me away.

Pros
Donner doing his thing
Good acting
Visually and audibly pleasing
Perfect music
Pitch perfect pacing, never a dull moment
Cons
Unavoidable camp elements

The company that put this out should have done that. Or at least made the cardboard substantial instead of paper thin, especially on the end. That didn't work at all.
The movies are what I remember at the theater on our dates. Very suspensful with the Biblical twist.  Great psychological horror and great acting, especially the original. Just buy it in a better package.",1509062400,2,539,4.39

Today its $12 & while it's worth $10, as a collector of ""full"" boxed sets, I would never pay $12 for it. Lots of people complain about the ""cheap box"". I actually like the box. Like the way it folds out. Like the cardboard sleves. Indiana Jones set was same & I paid good money for that. Overall I'm impressed with the set but without part 4 it's not complete & that sucks for me. Because I will never own 4 on Blu-ray now.

1352644,5,B00004TS0J,"The Omen Collection Blu-ray
Price value: I was lucky to purchase this around Christmas 2014 for only $9.99 which was a great bargain. I think any price below $20 is a great bargain for this product.
Picture/sound quality: Very impressive. I own hundreds of Blu-ray movies and most of the horror movies from this era (or even recent ones) don't have a high quality Blu-ray transfer. The Omen collection is a great exception. The first three movies, even though they are from the 70s, have no blemishes whatsoever and details are great. In certain parts, it appears that they may have used DNR to smooth out the picture but overall, I think the details are there.
Packaging: Unfortunately, the packaging is the weakest aspect of this product. There is nothing wrong with the design, it is just poorly executed due to the cheap material. The paper is too poor quality to be used for a box set and the pockets for the DVD holders are not glued well so they come apart almost instantly. If you use it gently, I think you will be fine (you may have to glue or tape the edges of the pocket holders for the DVDs)

Movies (light spoilers warning): I think all movies are quite entertaining although 2006 remake is probably the weakest of the set and unnecessary. It is almost frame by frame duplicate of the original movie with some not-so-good CGI effects (the scene with dogs attack and the scene where Robert hits Damien's guardian with the car). The first two movies are great and just classics for any horror fan. Omen III surprisingly a decent film despite the fact that it is the third installment (normally movies go downhill after the sequel but not this one) however it does suffer from some poor execution. It is quite unfortunate because it could have been a great movie. There are a couple of scenes that annoy me; first one is the scene where dogs attack Damien's would-be assassin, the dogs and the assassin are never in the same frame together, dogs just seem to gather around and make growling noises, it is a scene that totally lacks credibility (this scene annoys me because there are many movies where the dogs attacking a person is depicted very realistically not sure why they couldn't pull it off here), the other scene is in the beginning where one of the assailants' feet gets tangled up in the cable and he ends up dangling from the ceiling and goes swaying in the air and he catches fire, you can tell that it is a dummy because he doesn't struggle or move his arms (which a person on fire in that position would do), With those said, I still think it wraps up the franchise nicely.",1421712000,,3204,4.814882032667876

The best way, which they've never tried with video discs but which classical music CD makers have been using routinely for disc sets, is to put each disc in its own thin cardboard sleeve. This method reduces the thickness of the package, and it makes each disc easy to get to.

This product is another fold-out package, which is unhelpful, with a separate panel for each disc. The fold-out panel assembly fits into a cardboard box, so the outer container is cardboard and not plastic like all your other BDs.

But Unfortunately doesn't include the ""Omen IV: The Awakening"" that was made for TV in the early 1990's like it was in the DVD Collection of the Omen.

1352664,3,B00004TS0J,"The first is the best and a classic, which I watch almost every Halloween. Classy and well put together, it kick-started Richard Donner's career.

The second Omen is okay, good progression from the first, has a few good set-pieces, some good performances, good anamorphic cinematography and a good score by Jerry Goldsmith. Love the chorale-belch whenever that crow shows up. However, it falls into the formula of the first. Even if it is called the ""Omen"" it doesn't mean that there has to a be an endless series of omen deaths, IE the entire conceit of the ""Final Destination"" series. It's really about the antichrist taking over, so I don't think it's necessary for all these ""accidents"" to happen to his opponents. Even with the third film, things never get overt as you are waiting for them to do.
Sometimes it gets close, like in the second film and the brother's brain-anyeurism, but you never get a fire and brimstone standoff, like you are waiting for.

Third film has great performance from a very young Sam Neil, some good photography, good score again by Goldsmith, but that's about it. It's just the same formula again. Lots of talking, someone gets in the way of Damien's vague plans and boom, fatal ""accident"". Stand out scene is Damien's conversation with a giant crucifix he keeps in his attic.

The remake is not worth repeat visits, it's an exercise in brand-whoring. The filmmakers have no clue on what to do with this material. While there is plenty of opportunity for gothic-supernatural-thriller awesomeness, they find none...at all. It's like a cover of one of your favorite songs. Sometimes it's great, showing you a different side and that the song was just awesome no matter how it's presented. Sometimes it so bad, it not only makes you hate the artist who is doing the cover, it makes you second guess loving the original. This remake does no favors to the Omen series. It is pretty taint-ish, but I love the original so much I have blocked it from being tainted by this ungodly mess. Pun intended.

1352669,5,B00004TS0J,"forget the DVD releases of THE OMEN, DAMIEN-OMEN II, THE OMEN III FINAL CONFLICT that were released in the early 2000's

this Blu-ray collection has it all released in 2008 all 3 OMEN films on Blu-ray plus the remake of THE OMEN
i have watched all 3 Blu-ray's to check the quality except for the OMEN remake which i'm not interested in

the first 2 OMENS are excellent, beautiful Widescreen transfers in High Definition Audio much better quality than the DVD releases
Bright colours on all scenes, Blu-ray brings out the Texture and colour of the first 2 Omens
the Audio quality on both Omens has been enhanced aswell to 5.1 HD master Audio quality there Definitely is a Difference in the Audio quality for sure
the 3rd OMEN film has been given the same treatment beautiful Widescreen transfer in 5.1 HD master audio
the 4th Omen film is not included which i don't care i think the 4th film is pointless
20th century fox only made a 4th sequel to cash in on the other Omen's.
I didn't bother watching the OMEN 2006 release i prefer the old classic version
but i'm assuming the omen remake has an HD transfer anyway it was released in Today's current technology when the other's weren't
so i'm very impressed and blown away by the HD transfers of the 3 OMEN films no doubt about it.

now to the Special features
the extras on the OMEN blu-ray are exactly the same as the Collectors edition release in 2006
you get the 2 Documentaries 666 THE OMEN REVEALED and THE OMEN LEGACY which is incredible 90mins Documentary on all 3 films plus the 4th Omen film
and the featurettes, Jerry Goldsmith Discusses the Omen score
Curse or Coincidence featurette you also get WES CRAVEN opinion on the Omen featurette
you get the 2 Audio commentaries that were already on the Collectors edition release
so the Commentaries are nothing new
there's one Deleted scene that you can watch with-without commentary
plus the Stills Gallery of Photos taken during the filming, some of the Photos are of Holly Palance who played the first Nanny
Production Photos of her Hanging, very interesting to look at

but there's a brand new interview with Richard Donner recorded just for the Blu-ray release goes for 15mins
emotional interview, there's some things he talks about that was not mentioned in the making of Documentary
he also talks about some funny moments that happened during the filming of THE OMEN
very interesting interview i listen to the whole 15mins, Great interview

Unfortunately the special features with Omen II, III have not changed
there's no new interviews with Harvey Bernhard or John scott taylor who played Damien in Omen II
just the Commentary done by Harvey Bernhard from the DVD release
and the Commentary for the 3rd Omen that's all

ofcourse there's extras with the Omen remake
Revelation 666 faeturette, Abbey road sessions featurette and Extended scenes etc.

but the Picture and audio quality with all 3 omen films is amazing better than the DVD releases from years ago
so Definitely time to upgrade and get the blu-ray versions
and get rid of the DVD releases
i gave this collection 5 star rating no doubt about it.",1383264000,4,3121,4.726102941176471

1352671,1,B00004TS0J,"Full disclosure: I have not yet reviewed the quality of the blu-ray discs in this set, but wanted to add a few notes about the horrific packaging.

I received an order with two other blu-rays and the could hear a loose disc before even opening it for the first time. Obviously this happens to everyone now and then and blu-ray discs don't typically scratch easily. That said, I opened the package gently to avoid further damage due to the flimsiness of the thin, tissue-like cardboard holding the set together and found that three of the four discs were completely dislodged (one of which was backwards...somehow). The little circular pegs that hold the discs in place are some kind of squishy material and are basically useless at this point. It is a bit confusing how the discs are labeled for the original and remake versions of The Omen, but I soon figured out that the image of ""666"" was supposed to indicate that it was the remake (they both just have the title ""The Omen""). On the bottom of the outer box, the remake is labeled as The Omen: 666, but I had no clue about this since I only wanted the original trilogy anyway. That's not a big deal, but just further proof that there was zero thought put into the design of this set. Also, the box itself is DVD-sized, but I'm really not sure why - it probably would have been harder to harm the set if it were smaller in size like other blu-ray sets, but I'm certainly not an expert.

Overall, I regret paying the price I did for this set. In the past, many collections that were released with bad packaging ended up getting a major price drop eventually (after word spread) so it may be wise to wait if you must have it. As another reviewer stated, I recommend ordering this item by itself so it doesn't arrived completely flattened.

Hopefully this will be helpful to some of you.",1381190400,3,1837,4.477611940298507
1352672,2,B00004TS0J,"This review is for the Blu Ray collection, NOT the films themselves (which I adore).  The collection differs substantially from the original DVD collection--and not only because the made for television OMEN IV is replaced with the 2006 remake of the original.  The original DVD collection had lots of extras, including trailers and a documentary.  This collection only retains the commentaries.  Obviously the films are crisper, but the first film--either because of the source material or lack of attention, it's not clear--doesn't benefit tremendously from the higher definition (it remains grainy and the sound is uneven).  The hallmark of how ""cheap"" and lazily this collection was put together is the case: a flimsy cardboard foldout; the discs are held precariously on the cardboard with a foam disk.  I've never seen a DVD collection put together so .  . . carelessly.  It's as if Damien's father was forced to put out the DVD.  Don't pay full price for this set.  The films are worth your money, but I wouldn't think more than $15 for the whole lot.",1381017600,2,1057,4.954545454545454
1352673,1,B00004TS0J,"The Omen movies are great, but this is a review of ""The Omen Collection"" Blu-Ray Boxed Set packaging.

I'd like to find whoever designed this box set and slap them.  This is absolute garbage.  Each disc is mounted on a foam spool on card stock folded in 4, which is about as no-frills as it gets right off the bat.  But when folded up to be inserted into the sleeve, there is a huge gap between each 'page'.  In other words, the 'spine' of the set is 2 centimeters wide, but its pages take up about half a centimeter of that width.  Nothing holds the volume of the sleeve, and it is VERY easily damaged.  Mine arrived crushed flat as a pancake.  Shipping damage can happen to any item from time to time, but when a product is put together this flimsily, damage is practically guaranteed.

The set is also about an inch taller than a normal Blu-Ray box for no particular reason, which is more just a pet peeve of mine, but it seems to go hand-in-hand with the unnecessary width of the set, like the makers were trying to make the consumer think big box = big value.

Very unfortunate and disappointing presentation of a classic horror series.

If you do want to order this item, I'd recommend ordering it by itself to avoid any other items being packed on top of it in the same shipping box (given its larger-than-standard size and false impression of volume its likely to be placed on the bottom), and minimize the potential damage to the blu-ray packaging.",1381017600,3,1457,4.43984962406015

It's probably the flimsiest packaging I've ever seen for a Blu-ray set and I don't understand how this could even sell for the current sale price of $20, much less the usual retail asking price. The discs look great and their artwork is pretty cool and the artwork is pretty cool for the whole box but it's just designed so poorly. It literally feels like you are smashing it as you pick it up and hold it in your hands. It has an outer slipcover that is seen on the item description page here on Amazon but when you take the contents out, it becomes apparent that the discs are held in place only by little pieces of foam glued to cardboard. Okay well I could rant on and on about this for quite a while but overall I'd say just know what you're getting yourself into when purchasing this Blu-ray box set. It's October and that means I get to watch horror movies for a whole month so that's what I'm gonna do and I will try to accept this horrible attempt of a product.",1380931200,,1292,4.277551020408163

Omen II shows Damien at a boarding school. In Omen III, Damien is an adult played by the excellent Sam Neill. The Omen remake is fairly faithful to the original. This 4-disc collection released in 2008 has 4 Omen films included. The forgettable Omen IV: The Awakening (1991 TV Movie) and The Omen (1995 TV Movie) are not included. The 60-minute 1995 TV movie spin-off directed by Jack Sholder has never been released on DVD or Blu-ray (not much loss).

We also get some new HD content: Richard Donner interview (15-min), Omen Revelations (Trivia), additional commentary and isolated score track. There is over 4 hours of bonus content plus audio commentaries. The casing and packaging is quite flimsy as many have complained about the cheap over-sized cardboard. The video and audio are average. The advantage to owning this set is having most of the Omen films in one set on Blu-Ray (Damien and Omen III are not available in the US on Blu-Ray so you can get them here). I would rate the films 4 stars and the product 3 stars. If this collection had a little ""more"" I would give it 4 stars (it is good but not deluxe).

Instead of it I would have liked to have had ""omen 4"" but at least we got the first three movies in a fine blu ray package. The movies look pretty good too. The Omen is a horror classic and it looks the weakest but it has been cleaned up thankfully and picture wise it's color is mostly pretty darn close to what it was intended to look like. The next two look a bit better and although they are weaker in storyline , they are still very good horror movies. The newer Omen is just a flat remake and it's ok and it's picture looks the best because it's from 2004. The acting is great , especially in the first one , which was a huge hit movie. The second and third are pretty good and Sam Neil plays a grown up Damien in ""omen 3"" .  He is a high caliber actor by anyones standards.  The newest Omen is pretty good and Julia Styles really does a fine job as the mother here. The first one remains the true classic though with star turns from Gregory Peck ,and Lee Remick and Patrick troughton.

I read negative reviews sometimes on other types of packaging, for things I have ordered, and for the most part it was exaggerated. I should have listened to the reviews for this though. I can see why it was so cheap to buy. Although it was nice getting four of the movies on blu-ray in one box, the cheap paper box they come in is pitiful. It came all bent up and the discs were not in their holders. It really does feel like a thick paper box, as stated by another reviewer, and not a cardboard box. The disc center holders in this box are made of some cheap foam with a thin piece of plastic over it in an attempt to hold in the discs. If you jostle these even a little the discs slide right off. If you are going to order this be prepared to, potentially, receive a damaged disc.

Although, it is drifting from the likeliness of following the tiresome ""Book of Revelation"" biblical writings of the future coming of Satan and Jesus Christ Revisiting, I still thought that ""The Omen IV: The Awakening"" is still a worthy addition to ""The Omen"" series.

If anything, I think the 2006 remake of the original first Omen film was totally pointless.  It actually seems to follow the first story, word for word, and with no surprising new spin on the subject.  Just new actors, but the same written story.

I ordered this collection and it arrived crushed completely flat; the box was actually flat, not just crumpled a bit.  I received a replacement order and the set was boxed and shrink wrapped in the box.  The force of the shrinking plastic wrap was enough to crush the packaging and leave large creases in the packaging.

Upon opening the set I discovered that the reason for the damage was the package that the discs are in. There is absolutely no structural support in the case at all. It is simply a series of folded flaps with disc holders in a box. The box will be crushed with very little force, as there is nothing inside to act against crushing force.

ADVICE: Wait for a re-release if you, like me, are a collector who wants his discs and cases in pristine shape.

However I did have one complaint and that is the quality of the box, I mean come on. The disc holder slides out of the cover box and folds out. The disc holder is crap, its merely a piece of cardboard that has foam buttons that hold the disc in. I mean Ive heard of being eco green but I seriously thinks it ruins the quality of the set.

Overall while one views all the films in succession one realizes, or at least i did at how flimsy the writing is, the screen play... it's just a joke playing off religious fears, biblical nonsense.

When I found out this came out on Blu ray I just had to get it. It has been cleaned up a bit (the picture is sharper and the soundtrack is more defined) but it's still a thrill to watch, even after all of this time.

I quickly opened it up to find one of the dvds sliding freely inside the packaging.  I didn't hear any of the possible little broken bits that usually break off of a hard-case let let loose the dvd.  When I opened the dvd case this is what I found:

The set folds open to show all four dvds (it's all paper-thin paperstock, not one inch of it is plastic).  To my horror, the dvds are attach to the paperstock by (get this...) a FOAM DISC!  You have to press down on the foam and pull-up the dvd.  I'm waiting for the weight of the dvd to eventually pull the foam disc right off the packaging.  No wonder why the dvd came loose in shipment.  NOTHING secures the dvd in its packaging.  This might sound trivial, but the box set is even larger than your normal blu-ray dvd set (it's much taller and really stands out amongst other normal blu-ray dvds).

I checked the quality of the dvds and honestly could not find any difference in the blu-ray films vs. the OMEN 4-disc collection released a few years ago on DVD.  The remake is included in this one, and they could have just left it out...it's terrible.

SO BUYER BEWARE!!!  There's a chance that your blu-ray OMEN dvds will be sliding around in the box when you receive it, due to CHEAP blu-ray packaging.  I would have rather have paid an extra $10 for a normal, durable, hard-plastic blu-ray case for these movies.",1287014400,6,1668,4.384364820846906

For that price you would expect a much better product.  Most bluray sets come with a plastic box that is a little shorter than the regular DVD boxes like how the Die Hard Collection was done just a few years ago.

1352721,4,B00004TS0J,"It's Halloween time so I've been watching more horror then usual, which isn't saying much, and I've watching as much new horror as old ones.  I recently purchased the Blu Ray version of The Omen series.  It's a four disc set that includes The Omen, Damien: The Omen II, The Final Conflict: The Omen III, and The Omen remake(2006).  Nope, for some reason this Blu Ray box set didn't include the fourth Omen picture, which you can buy seperately on DVD, and did come in the DVD version of The Omen box set.  I seriously doubt anyone in their right mind will be crying in their sleep over this ommission.  Sure, if it was included I woudn't have minded,and I might even have popped it in to watch it once more for posterities sake, but I'm okay if I never have the chance to see it again.  It's a pretty bad, Showtime Original Movie.  But I did hear that if the TV movie had done better Showtime had planned on producing an Omen TV series.  Oh well, maybe it's all for the best based on the final result of The Omen IV: The Awakening.  For the first three Omen pictures the special features are all the same.  The Omen actually gets a couple of new special features.  One being a new, third commentary track with film historians including screenwriter Lem Dobbs(The Fugitive).  This new commentary focus's heavily on Jerry Goldsmith's score and the films general influences before and after it was made.  We also get a new picture in picture feature that most Blu Rays seem to have.  The second and third film only come with the previous release's trailers and commentaries.  The remake disc is the same as the previous DVD release, but for some reason it ommitts one of the DVD release's special featurette's Omenisms.  Why, I don't know.  I thought Blu Ray not only made the sound and picture better but also could hold more info on a single disc then DVD.  Whatever.

THE OMEN(1976): This is a landmark horror film.  It, along with Jaws and The Exorcist, help knock Roger Corman and Hammer films out of their markets.  Hollywood took an interst in making genre pictures, films that Corman and Hammer had been doing forever, and doing them on a grand scale with known actors and movie stars.  This film stars Gregor Peck(limited range but great imposing, quiet screen presence), Lee Remick(underrated, never got the credit she deserved in her short career) David Warner(c'mon, if you're a genre fan you know this guy, and if you don't you should be ashamed of yourself).  This film isn't particularly frightening honestly, but it's very entertaining and exciting.  The performances are all grounded and the direction is very stylish but restrained in the vein of Hitchcock.  Richard Donner had directed every Tv show known to man at this point in his career(everything ranging from Maverick, Gilligans Island and Wild, Wild West).  This was the film that legitimised him and its success led him to getting the gig of directing Superman: The movie.  On his commentary track, he has two--one with editor Stuart Baird and one with screenwriter/director Brian Helgeland, he states that the trick to The Omen working is that he never thought the child was the actual son of Satan.  He directed it as if everything in the film was just horrible coincidence, an the guilt of Gregory Peck's character over lying to his wife about the baby swap influences what he thinks and his sanity.  It's a smart move.  It keeps the film honest and not over the top.  Apparently, the original screenplay by David Seltzer(wront John Frankenheimer's underrated horror film The Prophecy) had demon creatures popping into the film.  The film also has a dark sense of humor in its grand gugnol, Rube Goldberg inspired death scenes.  The most famous being how David Warner's head loses touch with his body.  The disc also has retrospective documentaries, interviews one on one with David Seltzer and Richard Donner, and most intersting, a one on one with the late great composer Jerry Goldsmith----who one his only Academy Award for his score in this film.  There's also pictures and stills, and the trailers.  A very good loaded package and if you didn't like the other films this set up would keep you busy for at least a day.
5 out of 5 stars.

DAMIEN: THE OMEN II: Oh boy, what a terrible movie,and an even worse sequel! Not only is this sequel a pale imitation, it's really boring.  Omen producer Harvey Bernhard came up with the story for this sequel and it was rushed into production.  Sure, the deaths, espeically one involving an elevator, are more elaborate, but so what?  Richard Donner's The Omen was so much more then gruesome death scenes.  This sequel seemed to only latch onto that aspect of the original.  The only neat thing this sequel does is set up where Damien is going in the future  and alludes to what Satan's ultimate plan might be.  The disc has the trailer and a commentary track by writer/producer Harvey Bernhard.  Haven't listened to it as I don't care, but one of these days I might give it a spin.  Jerry Goldsmith returns to score the film and supply it with its only admirable trait.  There are scenes in this film involving attacking ravens that are too hyterical to describe and may be worth watching this film for some unintentional humor.
2 out of 5 stars.

THE FINAL CONFLICT: THE OMEN III:  Yes, we're back on track, and it's no surprise as Richard Donner returns to this franchise in an executive producer capacity.  We finally move away from the evil child aspect that was beyond played out anc cliche'd by the time this third installment reached multiplex's.  Sam Neil plays the adult version of Damien Thorn, in one of his first leading film roles.  He is very good in this film.  His portrayal keeps you glued to the screen.  The actual character of Damien has never really been fleshed out in the previous installments.  He was just kind of there and almost an innocent bystander to what was going on around him.  At the end of part II we get to see him sort of accept his role.  This film plays that to full effect and adds in all the politics and corporate endeavors you would assume the Devil would want to be involved in.  The film has the style back from the original, and so sorrowfully lacking int he second.  The ending is sort of abstract and with the new characterization of Damien has a bit of tragedy in it and it totally works even if it's mostly on an abstract level.  Like the second film this one only comes with the trailer and a comentary track by the director.
4 out of 5 stars

THE OMEN(2006): Ah, in the decade of the remake did you really think that The Omen would be ammune?  No way!  The Omen dented into the subculture's zeitgeist and became a brand name, so this was  perfect remake to have on your hands, especially if you want to assure you make some undeserved dough off of it.  Though, out of the many remakes in the last ten years this one isn't awful.  Though, that may have to do with the fact that it follows the original very closely.  Hell, even the remake script was written, or rather re-written, by the original's writer David Seltzer.  There are some obvious modifications in this remake.  First off, Damien seems to be more aware of his evil.  The way he is directed and played in this remake is more as a malevolent presence then the cute innocent in the original.  In the first film we were never sure how much Damien knew until the last shot of him smiling as the film's closing.  In this film director John Moore(Behind Enemy Lines, Max Payne) tips us off pretty early that Damien is aware of his destiny.  The scene in the car when the Thorn's are on the way to the wedding Church, after Damien's freak out, Damien glares at his mother played by Julia Styles.  Also, there scene in the monkey house(a riff on the safari trail scene in the original involving some very mad babboons) Damien glares at the animals and says, ""They're afraid of me"", very coldly.  Also, the cast is made more age appropriate.  I always had trouble with buying Gregory Peck as a new father to be.  Liev Streiber takes over for Peck in this remake and does very well.  He gives a very intricate and subtle peformance in this film.  He helps keep the itnerest invested the whole time.  Julia Styles does well too.  She grounds her character.  Mrs. Thorn is changed in the remake.  She seems to doubt her son sooner and their relationship seems more combative.  The final and most major change this remake does is the fact that it opens with the Vatican already expecting the arrival of the AntiChrist.  They look on counting the signs or omens, if you will, of the coming of the apocalypse.  Though, how tasteful showing and using imagery of 9-11 in a fluffy horror film like this is up for debate. Personally, it made me uncomfortable, but I understood what the filmmakers were trying to do.  They were justifying their remake by making it relevant to the modern times.  It's only half successful.  The problem with this remake is that it's too much like the orignal.  If you've seen the '76 version you'll get nothing new or exciting out of this remake.  Yes, the acting is all quite good from Styles, Streiver to the supporting cast which includes Michael Gambon, Pete Postelwaite, David Thewlis, and the scene stealer Mia Farrow as nanny Ms. Blaylock.  Farrow takes a different approach by playing Blaylock as a Stepford nanny, all smiles with something brewing beneath.  Good casting, cool change, and very fun.  Also, director John Moore over directs every scene like he's doing a big Bruckheimer action film as opposed to a Gothic horror yarn.  All the death scenes are ramped up and over produced so they lack effect and just become spectacle on the level of the later Final Destination films.
3 out of 5 films.

So, this set is worth having.  The picture is brilliant and the sound is even better.  You get a decent amount of extras, especially on the first and best film, and you'll never feel compelled to sit through the ommitted fourth film.  You get two really good films, one bad one, and one mediocre one.  As much as I don't care for the sequel and the remake I will watch them each again so for me it's worth it.  Happy Halloween and good luck at the next Saw film.  My fingers are crossed.....",1256083200,4,10252,4.595920617420066

1352723,4,B00004TS0J,"Packaging:  20th Century Fox should be ashamed of the packaging for this disc set.  I have collected movies for over 25 years.  This included VHS, LaserDisc, DVDs and Blu-Rays.  I currently own over 3500 DVD/Blu-Rays.  I typically don't submit reviews, but the Omen (original) is one of my favorite movies.  Regrettably, the packaging is one of the worst I've seen.  It remindes me of the cheap Warner Brother's cardboard covers.  But worse, this cover doesn't even have standard spindle retainers.  The cover is a thin (too thin) carboard with adhesive circular foam spindles.  On the copy I receive the ""security tag"" was glued to the foam spindle.  In order to remove the disc, I had to pull off the security tag which in turn pulled off the spindle.  I now have a new collection with 1 disc that won't stay in the case.

Move/Transfer:  The movies are great.  The Omen 1 and 2 hold up well and are great movies.  The Omen III is not up to par with the first 2, but completes the series.  The new version does not have the magic of the original Omen (missing the well acted transformation of Gregory Peck).  The video and audio transfers are both very good.

Despite the packaging, I'm happy to see the collection on Blu-Ray.  I may try and purchase each movie seperately in an effort to get the standard Blu-Ray covers. The packaging issue is not limited to The Omen.  The irregular packaging of The Planet of the Apes suffers as well.  When will the studios spend the extra 20 cents and standardize the packaging which will help with disc storage, and with disc protection over time.",1230508800,6,1588,4.616487455197133

The original Omen comes loaded with extra features on Blu-ray.  Omen 2 and 3 however have nothing extra on them that did not appear on the DVD editions.  This was a little disappointing for me.  At least they could have thrown in a trivia track or something.  The Omen remake is the same exact disc that was previously released on Blu.  My one BIG complaint about this set would have to be the packaging.  Considering the price of the set, it comes packaged in a very shoddily made box.  I'm not sure if this is supposed to be ""Earth Friendly"" by not using any plastic housing for the discs, but Fox seriously dropped the ball on the packaging.  The outer case has very cool artwork, but it is not sturdy at all.  The movies are housed on a fold out inner jacket where each movie is simply held in place with a foam rubber hub.  There is no booklet or anything else.  Not only is the box cheaply constructed, it is also waaaay too big for a Blu-ray.  It is about the size of a regular DVD, which causes it to really stick out amongst the rest of my collection.

Bottom Line:  If you love the Omen series as much as I, you won't be disappointed with the actual movies.  However, be warned that the packaging is really not in keeping with other sets in this price range (e.g. The Matrix, The Godfather)",1223942400,48,1415,4.279245283018868

With the music, those scary looks from the little boy, and the shocks of who is pro-Antichrist and who is pro-Jesus, so to speak. The acting is really good, especially the scene when the family is going to church for the wedding. There is a scene where the Mom falls to the floor from a high-up landing which was smartly thought out on how to do it without actually having her fall from too high up. That's where the good stuff ends, with the end of the first movie. The other 3 kinda suck. 'Omen 2' is not as good. There are still the shocks of who is pro-Antichrist and pro-Jesus, but that's it. Damien is older, but not scary, he seems weak. The back says something about him wanting to take over the family buisness, which is sort of a lie, he never really says he wants it, he just kind of kills people. The third one stars Sam Neil, from 'Jurassic Park' fame. SPOILER ALERT: Why did he die? He wasn't stabbed with all the daggers in a cross fashion. [...] . END OF SPOILER ALERT. Sam Neil is actually kind of creepy. The ending is cheesy. The fourth, and final, is a little different. This time, it's a little girl who is the Antichrist. This movie coulda been scary, but it wasn't. The ending makes it seem a little unresolved, which made me think there was gonna be a 5th.",1129852800,,1447,4.2086330935251794

1352735,4,B00004TS0J,"One of the greatest horror movie trilogies ever made the ""Omen"" series started off great and slowly faltered with each of its next three entries. Still, the series had some very devoted followers, so Fox decided to please them by releasing all four of them in a boxed set. How does it measure up?. Here is my review for each film.

""The Omen"" (1976, R) The first entry in the series is a horror classic. UN Ambassador Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck) and his wife Kathy (Lee Remick) have given birth to a stillborn baby. Kathy does not know the child is dead, however, so Robert passes an orphaned infant as the child - unaware of its origins. They name him Damien. The first five years with Damien are more or less fine. The Thorns are a happy family with him in their lives. But on Damien's fifth birthday, something horrible occurs. The family nanny jumps out of window and hangs herself, telling Damien ""it's all for you!"". Then, a priest comes into Robert's office and tries to warn him that Damien is the antichrist. But Robert doesn't listen to him, and the priest is subsequently impaled by a lightning rod. A photographer (David Warner) becomes obsessed with the deaths and their connection to Thorn. He meeets with Thron and shows him photos he took of the deceased. They notice that several objects in the photos hint at their subsequent demise. Meanwhile, Damien and Kathy go to the zoo, where there attacked by monkeys. The Thorns then get a new nanny, the sinister Mrs. Baylock (Billie Whitelaw). Kathy soon learns she is pregnant, adding a sense of joy to the household. But increasingly dark situations overshdow their happiness. Kathy falls from a staircase and has miscarriage. Robert and the photographer are attackd by jackals in a cemetary while searching for Damien's mother's grave. To put the final nail in the coffee, Kathy is killed when Mrs. Baylock pushes her out of a hospital window. Now that he's lost his true love, Robert is fully onvinced that Damien is who everyone says he is. He visits a religious archeologist named Bugenhagen. He tells him that he must kill the boy. Robert is extremely apprehensive about killing the child, so the photographer vows to do it. However, he is killed in one of the best movie deaths ever. Now, it's up to Robert to stop his satanic child from destroying the world. It all adds up to a terrifying climax, nd the last scene of the movie will stay with you forever.

The first film in the series is a horror classic. Peck and Remmick turn in excellent performances as Robert and Kathy. They proved that even in 1976, there was still room for the legends of yesteryeat in Hollywood. David Warner and Billie Whitelaw were great in their supporting roles. And the kid who played Damien was terrifying. And who can forget the Oscar-winning score by Jerry Goldsmith? It is the greatest horror movie music, the music gets stuck in your head and scars the hell out of you. The extras are great. A great start to the series. 5/5.

""Damien: Omen II"" (1978, R) The second chapter in the series has Damien livng with his Uncle (William Holden and his Aunt (Lee Grant). The film starts off a few months after the events of the first film, with Bugenhagen and a friend searching for the knives that are to kill Damien. However, they are killed when a large pile of rocks enclose them in a cave. Seven year go by and we see Damien lving with his wealthy aunt and uncle. One night, Aunt Marion (Sylvia Sidney) visits and warns them to get rid of Damien. That night, she dies mysteriously. Damien and his cousin are soon sent off to a high class school where the Thorn legacy lies. Even stranger events occur. A field trip turns into a disaster. His brother is killed on an ice skating rink. Soon, his uncle learns of Damien's true identity. He tries to kill him, but his aunt kills him, then herself, thus bringing an end to the movie.

While not as good as the first one, this film still turns in some genuine chills and thrills. Holden and Grant gave great performances, and the extras are passable. Overall, about a 4/5.

""Omen III: The Final Conflict"" (1981, R) This is where the series took a massive nosedive. 19 years have passed since the second film's happenings occured, and Damien Thorn (Same Neil) is now 33 years old and planning to take over his father's business - and the world. When he learns that the second coming of Christ is about to happen, he gather his followers to do everything they can stop him. He developes an elaborate plan to kill babies (sickening). The ending is predictable, as we all know Damien won't win.

This film is unbearable. Sam Neil gives an unusually bad performance (he is usually a very good actor) as Damien, and the rest of the cast is awful as well. The commentary is bland, and the only redeeming feature of this film is another creepy Jerry Oldsmith score. 2/5

""Omen IV: The Awakening"". This film is actuallly not as bad as some would make it out to be. It is anything but scary, but it is still a good timekiller. Not as good as parts one or two (it's essentially a remake of part one with a girl instead of a boy), but it's about a 3/5.

I would recommend this boxed set to all fans as well as people interested in the movie. The first three movies are sold separately, but the fourth one is only available here, and it is nice to have all the films in one place.",1122681600,,5365,4.5180226570545825
1352736,5,B00004TS0J,"I am a huge fan of The Omen series and I love everyone of them, I have a review of each below-

The Omen- A truely great movie. In this movie Mrs. Kathy Thorn gives birth to a stillborn child, to sheild her from the truth her Husband Ambassador Robert Thorn adopts a orphan boy, knowing nothing of the boys hellish origins. This legacy of terror begins at little Damien Thorn's 5th birthday, when his nanny hangs her self from the top of the Thorn Mansion. Pretty soon many horrible 'accidents' start to happen and little by little Robert realises his son is the Anti-Christ and must try to stop him...I would give this movie six out of five stars if possible but Ill settle and give it 5 out of 5.

Damien: The Omen II- Damien is now a young man of 13, and has gone to live with his aunt and uncle, he now realizes the great power he has and that he is the Anti-Christ himself. Several gruesome deaths occur to any who oppose him and Uncle Thorn must try to end what his brother started. 5 out of 5 stars

The Final Conflict- In this movie Damien is now a very rich and powerful man of 23. He becomes ambassador following in his adopted fathers footsteps all while continuing to follow in his true fathers footsteps. This movie lacks a factor of the previous two, the fact that it is a child causing all the deaths and chaos, though it is still a great movie. 4 out of 5 stars

The Omen IV: The Awakening- This movie is EXTREAMLY under-rated, it brings the series back to its origins. Little Delia is an adopted child who has trouble making friends in school, but after a few 'accidents' eeriely similar to those in the case of one Damien Thorn, Delia and her adopted mother realize what she really is, the heir of the Anti-Christ. I think this movie is great dispite what anyone else thinks about it I give it a 5 out of 5.

1352739,3,B00004TS0J,"Rarely regarded as one of the great horror movie series, ""The Omen"" movies tell the story of Damien Thorn, the Antichrist (and later his daughter). They range from excellent to shlock, as most horror film trilogies do. This boxed set features all four ""Omen"" films""
1976's ""The Omen"" is the first and best of the series. I think it is better than the grossly overrated ""The Exorcist"", as this one has a more disturbing and realistic plot line. Robert and Kathy Thorn (Gregory Peck and Lee Remick) are an English governmnet official and his wife have given birth to a stillborn child. Kathy doens't know, so Robert adopts one and passes it off as the dead baby. Baby Damien becomes the light of their life. Then when he turns 5, eerie stuff begins to happen. First, his nanny commits suicide. Then a priest comes to see Thorn at his ofice and urges him to kill his son, saying he's the Antichrist, the son of Satan. Soon, a rapid - fire series of coincidences resulting in the deaths of people around Damien make Robert grwo suspicous. He and a photographer David Warner investigate. But it isn't until Warner is killed (in one of the best movie deaths ever) that Robert realizes the truth.
This is a great horror movie. Gregory Peck and Lee Remick turn in their best latter - day performances and prove that there was a place for aging screen vets in Hollywood other than tv movies and ""That's Entertainment"". Jerry Goldsmith's chilling score is the best I've ever heard in a horror film and he deserved the Oscar he won for it. Extras are several excellent documentaries, trailers and audio commentaries.
1978's ""Damien: Omen 2"" takes place 7 years later. Damine is now 12 years old, living with his aunt and uncle (Lee Grant and William Holden). This sequel marks a turning point in the series, as Damien is now aware of who he really is. At first, he's scared but soon grows to enjoy them.
This film is lesser than the first one but provides some genuine jitters, especially the ""Designing Women"" guy stuck in the elevator and the frightening ending. Also, Holden and Grant turn in excllent performances.
""Omen III: The Final Conflict"" is where the series really began to slip. Damien (Sam Neil) is now 32 years old and is intent on world dominaton. Whn he soon realizes Christ is coming back for the final battle between good and evil, he soon becomes more ruthlss than ever, going as far as to kill infants. This made me sick. The only thing I liked in this one was that it had a happy ending. The acting is wooden. It's hard to believe that a 5 - year old (the first one's Harvey Stevens) can do Damien better than Sam Neil. Fortunately, Neil found his voice and became one of the most versatile (and well - known) character actors ever. The only thing here other than the acting is another spooky Jerry Goldsmith score.
""Omen IV: The Awakening"" tried teribly to resurrect the series. Karen and Gene York adopt a baby and the same things that happen in the first one happen here, only here it stinks. That's all I have to say about this movie.
Overall, a good boxed set of classic horror movies that will scare you to death. The first two are worth watching but the last two are horrible. Best to get the first two separately.",1089504000,3,3232,4.545454545454546
1352740,3,B00004TS0J,"OMEN - I'm sure when this movie came out it scared the socks off
  people. There were definately some eerie moments within
  the film. The book of Revelation has always fascinated me
  along with the scriptures that tell about the rise of
  the Antichrist. As for the Omen, it held my interest but
  seemed to drag at times. Despite the slow pace of the
  movie, it was in no way boring. Though you don't get to
  see much of the 5 year old Damien (the Antichrist),
  his character development is still portrayed during the
  film. I give OMEN *** stars.
DAMIEN - Known as OMEN II, this movie is probably the best in
  the series. Here we see 13 year old Damien brilliantly
  portrayed along with his roots of power. Damien is
  smart and cunning. When he learns who he is, Damien
  takes desperate measures to ensure that no one close to
  him betrays his trust. For the most part, there are no
  slow spots within the movie and whether you like the
  first Omen or not I'm sure this sequel is sure to
  please. I give DAMIEN **** stars.
FINAL CONFLICT - The third Omen in the series takes a bit of a
  nose dive from the previous film. Damien is 32
  years old and is now in control of the world
  powers. If you expect this movie to show the
  ruthless reign of the Antichrist, you will be
  sorely disappointed. I won't spoil the movie
  for anyone who hasn't seen it but I do have a
  particular complaint; though this movie gives
  accurate scripture references it does not
  present the audience with accurate events of
  the Antichrist during his reign of power. For
  example, Jesus in not going to be born a second
  time here on earth. Also, the Antichrist is not
  defeated until 3-4 years after he wages a war
  on the nations. (Yes, I am a Christian and if
  someone is going to make a movie that tells
  about the rise and fall of the Antichrist then
  the movie needs to stay in accordance with the
  scriptures of the Bible). Another complaint I
  have is that this movie drags out even more so
  than the first one. Unless you want to see the
  conclusion of what happens to Damien (as I'm
  sure that most people will), this is not a
  movie that I would recommend.
  I give FINAL CONFLICT ** stars.
AWAKENING - As far as I am concerned, this is the last Omen in
  the series that should have never existed. Do I say
  that because this Omen is not related to the
  previous three? To a certain degree, yes. As for the
  movie itself, the fourth Omen was a ""made for TV""
  movie and it shows. Now don't misunderstand me, I'm
  not saying that all TV made movies are bad but this
  one definately had a mediocre script. The girl in
  this movie is the daughter of Damien (the previous
  Antichrist). To sum up the plot, the girl shows her
  evil power in various yet ridiculous ways. The fouth
  Omen is the Halloween III of the series if you will.
  For the most part, it is irrelevent to the preivous
  films that somehow spawned it.
  I give AWAKENING * star due to the last third of the
  movie being interesting.",1089072000,6,3035,4.258992805755396
1352741,5,B00004TS0J,"""The Omen"" saga is one of the most enduring (albeit longest - running) horror movie franchises in film history, spanning over 16 years and feature Gregory Peck, Lee Remick, William Holden, Lee Grant and Sam Neill in top - notch performances.
The first film is undoubtedly the best in the series, and the main sreason why I gave the set five stars. I tend to like this movie more than the grossly overrated ""The Excorcist"" because unlike that one this one has a more realistic storyline, plus it did not feature arguably the greatest and bloodiest beheading sequence ever filmed (just wait til you see it, it's amazing). It also features screen legends Gregory Peck (who unfortuneatley left us in June of last year) and Lee Remick in their latter - day prime, as this film undoubtedly proved that there still was a place for aging screen veterans in cinemas other than ""That's Entertainment"". I also remember being afraid of Jerry Goldsmith's eerie score for the film, especially the gregorian chants (one of them was nominated for an Oscar). All in all, this film is truly scary.
1978's ""Damien: Omen 2"" is a somewhat lesser sequel. It documents Damien going through his adolescent years. It is also odd to learn that in this film that Damien himself realizes he's the son of the devil. And while it's not as good as the first one, it does feature some truly disturbing moments (the scene with the man stuck in the elevator is eerily reminiscent of Part One's beheading sequence) and features about the same level of star power, as Lee Grant and William Holden are very good in their respective roles.
""Omen 3: The Final Conflict"" is when the series begins to slip. It jumps ahead about 19 or so years past the second one. Damien (the usually excellent Sam Neill) is now the U.S. Ambassador awaiting the return of Christ and the final battle between good and evil. Damien then comes up with this rediculous idea of killing babies (how sickening even for a horror movie) before he reaches his last confrontation with The Lord. Unlike the previous two, this chapter of ""The Omen"" has a happy ending, as ...
In 1991, HBO resurrected the ""Omen series with ""Omen 4: The Awakening"". I hated it. It tells the story of Delia, a seemingly harmless girl who lives with rich, wealthy parents who adopted her. But starnge things happen wherever she goes. And just about every single sequence in the film is an obvious copy of everything that happened in the first part, from the nanny falling out of the window to the ending sequencewhen the main character is shot (though in this one, the main character shoots herself). As you watch it, you can't help think if this made - for - tv junk is the work of Satan himself.
Overall, this isn't a really bad set. It does feature the excellent first chapter and the down but not out second part. Maybe parts 3 & 4 are lesser but are needed if you want to learn the full root of Damian's evil ways (and besides, if you are interested in part 4, you have to get the boxed set, as it is not available seperately). So I do think this is an essential set, especially if you are fan of horror movies.",1076112000,9,3125,4.552397868561279
1352742,4,B00004TS0J,"The Omen series is arguably the great trilogy of the horror genre.  Some could argue that Romero's zombie trilogy is superior, but Romero's films are not connected by characters or events while The Omen series is.  Charting the rise and fall of the Antichrist fortold in the book of Revelation, The Omen series certainly lives up (or down, depending on you view) to its reputation.
The series got of to a solid start with The Omen.  Orginally conceived as a stand alone picture, The Omen tells the story of politician Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck), who adopts a mysterious child (whom they name Damien) to spare his wife (Lee Remick) the emotionally devestating news that their child died at birth.  Five years later, strange events and his wife's growing mental unbalance drive Thorn to discover just who Damien is...
Damien Omen II picks up seven years later, with Damien now 12 years old and living with his Aunt Ann (Lee Grant) and Uncle Richard (William Holden).  Again strange tragedies force his foster parents to look closer at Damien.  The sequel has some interesting, albeit underexplored, ideas to offer and even more dramatic accidents.  While not as suspenseful or atmospheric as the first movie, Damien Omen II is still an entertaining sequel.
The Final Conflict has a now grown Damien Thorn poised to rule to world.  Sadly the conflict that had been promised for two movies (i.e. world war, armies of good and of evil, etc.) is pretty much absent.  The movie does feature a few bloodcurdling moments and does deserve a nod for both daring to turn around the biblical story of King Herod's attempt to kill the infant Jesus by having Damien send his disciples on a post messiah birth hunt AND showing the actual Second Coming of Christ.  While that may count for something, the focus of the story is way too underplayed considering just what the movie was supposed to building up to.  As Roger Ebert said when the movie was first released, those expecting Damien Thorn standing atop a cloud and shooting lazer bolts from his hands at approaching armies, or something like that, will be sorely disappointed.  Nonetheless, it brings the series to a conclusion.
Which leaves the set with Omen IV: The Awakening, which is the most illogical of sequel cash-ins.  An up and coming politican and his wife adopt a young girl with decidely mystertious origins, sound familiar?  As strange occurrences and suspicions mount, the adoptive mother begins looking into his daughters past.  Being made for television (and partially directed by the guy that made Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers) it is overly melodramatic and lacking in atmosphere and suspense.  It also takes place in a world where Damien Thorn died, yet Christ did not return.  So was Damien the Antichrist or not?  Omen IV: The Awakening tries to have its cake and eat it to.  It is not surprising that Fox aired the telefilm, but passed on the TV series it was supposed to lead into.  Producers Harvey Bernhard and Mace Neufeld would have been better off just starting from scratch and retelling The Omen as a massive television series.  But they didn't, so the horror genre's best trilogy has a bitter aftertaste.
The actual trilogy is treated rather nicely.  The Omen has a commentary by director Richard Donner and editor Stuart Baird as well as some behind the scenes documentaries.  Damien Omen II has a commentary by Harvey Bernhard (who offers some interesting information on the sequel, but his attention fades in and out as he gets distracted in the middle of a story by the events on screen) and The Final Conflict offers a sporadic commentary by director Graham Baker.  Everybody ignores Omen IV: The Awakening, which is just the treatment it deserves.
The Omen TRILOGY is an essential for horror fans and buying this boxed set is a better way of getting them than purchasing them separately, just be prepared to have that fourth (and pretty much free after the math) taking up unnecessary space, which is just what it has been doing since 1991.",1075507200,,4031,4.834061135371179
1352743,5,B00004TS0J,"I've always loved the Omen since it first appeared on screen. Now I have it on DVD in the entire 4 part series. I feel that although part one is the pace setter and is a great movie, part 2 is the best written story of the 3 originals. Damian's inability to escape who he is and go his own path is excellent.
Part 4 is a branch off the first 3 and has a few good moments but just doesn't quite have the edge that parts 1-3 have. It appeared that the writer was trying too hard to tie in the story with the new age crowd. In all, this series is a must have for the horror, psychological thriller fan in everyone.",1060560000,3,611,3.935483870967742
1352744,5,B00004TS0J,"The Omen
The Devil's childe incarnated here in the form of an adorable little English boy. Born into wealth & prestige, the son of senator destined for the presidency --- it seems that ""Satan"" planned well {of course}, to place ""His"" son in prominance, instead of in some dungheap of a manger {who does that remind you of?}.
One after another, obstacles {human & otherwise} are removed from the path of the Devil's son's path --- whomever dares get in His way.....
This movie draws from JC-mythology from the book of ""Revelation"" of an apocalyptic anti-christ / tyrant born to dominate the earth. He carries the dreaded ""666"" birthmark upon his head --- proof positive he is ""The One"".
In one particularly dramatic scene, Damian refuses to be led into an Episcopal church. Instead, his mother takes him to the zoo, where the resident animals panic & lash out in fear & anger. Small wonder --- he is Thanatos made flesh.
Born of a jackal, Damian is protected by exarchs of Hell --- a good-natured woman, & a strong & beautiful doberman --- erego, the diabolical connection. Damian.....the name has since been the favorite for infernal children.....
Damien Omen 2
The second six in the saga of this classic infernal trinity. Here, in military school, Damian comes to grips with the realization that he is this antichrist character, after being reassured by an official. Damian learns to grasp His power, & even his own brother is annihilated, who threatened to stop Damian's destiny.
Again, his parental guardians get the proverbial axe, as 'The Antichrist' continues on his path to world dominion.
Damien III: The Final Conflict
Damien is all grown up here, & has taken his place as President of 'Thorn Industries', a global conglomerate incorperating everything from product manufacture to food charities, & is firmly allied with the UN {of course}.
In the darkest of plans, children are sacrificed, a politician commits suicide {by the auspice of satanical forces}, & the homicidal efforts of a secret xian order to murder Damien Thorn rotinelt prove to be ineffectual & laughable.
Thorn has his own ""Ritual Chamber"", in which the nazarene is crucified, not inverse as you would expect, but turned around so that his naked posterior shows most humiliatingly. Thorn blasphemously rants at the nazarene in a messe noiresque fashion, & shows what proves to be one of the most powerfully sacriligeous scenes in cinematographic history.
""Nazarene......you have won NOTHING.....""
Omen IV: A New Awakening
Damien Thorn is reborn in his subsequent sister Delia, a dark-haired little girl who is adopted by a politician destined fo the presidency --- sound familiar? The Antichrist is persistent.
A nun turned prostitute then evangelical jesus-freak is tormented with the knowledge of helping to bring 'the evil' into the world; she prays to 'god' for forgiveness that she didn't kill the child when she had the chance. Mother Superior has a heart attack after slapping the holy sheizer out of the pre-nun, & a crucifix inverts during an agonizing supplication.
Very early on, she shows signs of her 'wickedness' --- scratching her mother across the cheek while still but an infant.
As might be expected, her whole childhood is filled with a series of anomeles.
While at school, a ...-disturbing little brat picks on little Delia for some undetermined reason, perhaps as an exercise in masochism. In a particularly memorable scene, the brat makes off with Delia's lunchbox, dumping the contents onto the floor, stamping on it while laughing idiotically. Well, Delia doesn't take kindly to this antagonistic gesture, & forthwith slams her lunchbox square across the brute's ugly mug --- he just sits in the corner crying his little beady eyes out, after managing to strike little Delia. But she gets her revenge --- the next day, during a break, Delia makes off with his lunch, & runs out to mount & climb a ladder leading to the roof. When she gets quite a ways up, the little pigface follows, & begins to climb, but lo & behold, he's afraid of heights!
He ends up urinating all over himself in front of the whole class. Ah, sweet revenge......
Next, babysitter selection comes along, & who manages to get the job, but a new-age flake / weakan type.
One day, Delia comes in from playing, & notices the babysitter sitting in the kitchen with her mother, with a book displayed on the table, entitled, ""The Book of Light""; I paraphrase --- ""It's all about healing, & crystals....."", ""And stupid junk!"" yells Delia, slamming the book on the floor. A truly wonderful scene.
Another scene involves curious Delia inspecting the weakan's crystal necklace. Guess what? It turns black. As do all of the crystals in her drawer.
Another incident involved the babysitter taking a shower, when all of a sudden, she sees an inverted cross appear in the steam on the mirror. Frightened, she finally employs one of her 'wippie' friends to 'feel the vibe' --- well, he promptly becomes quite ill, almost smashing his car into Delia's 'mother's'.
The weakan arranges to trick Delia into attending a weaker - blindlight convention, where all manner of occultnik idiocy is enacted. By & by, as Delia passes the different booths, the practitioners are horrified by her presence, much like rabbits in the face of a stalking predator, until she is finally sabotaged, & forced to take a Kirlian photograph, which develops quite predictably. Swirls of black & red paint, which denotes chaos.
Eventually, one of the flame tossers ignites himself, which catches upon the roof of a booth, & soon, the whole place is a raging inferno, with Delia smirking in its wake.
Eventually, Delia's 'mother' gets the 'xoid cooties', the paranoia bug, consulting priests & pastors about the rise of the Antichrist, the book of Revelations, etc.
Finally, with the help of the 'lambs of god', she manages to justify her paranoia, & makes up her mind for infanticide. Not surprising, actually, considering that the judeo-xian god has been guilty of this atrocity twice {jeezwiz & Ezekiel's son Abraham --- the latter, which was a cruel mind-scrambling joke}.
The Detective helping her gets demolished, amidst a chorus of spechtral dark angels.
The little nun finally finds relief by the fang, & the weaker is destoyed. The 'mother' stalks towards the bedroom, as Delia holds the infant; the 'mother' points her gun, the baby displays the characteristic 'Mark of the Beast', & then.........?
Overall, Omen 4 is very entertaining, without the demoralization. Delia proves herself to be quite a demon-spawn.",1043712000,2,6551,4.989031078610603
1352745,4,B00004TS0J,"Okay, so the Omen IV takes liberties with a stretch from the original plot line.  So what?  I think it was made with attention to detail such as, the way the picture is colorized like the originals, the music score, and the direction of the movie.  I think for a made for tv movie, it's pretty good.  I won't comment on the first three because they've been well covered. My last comment is:  This play acting and these aren't real stories.

they should of done Omen III The Rise to Power, it would of been he of taken control of United Nations and European Union, Omen IV Abomination when he desecrates the church and says he's god and hell breakes loose and then Omen V the Final Conflict when they go and fight on Armageddon and Christ comes and destroys him. that i think they should done that but still is a good trilogy specially i liked the first one and Thrid one with it's haunting soundtrack spooked me out.
in all i liked the whole series but Omen IV.
buy it for the first three but for Omen IV keep it inside the box or your curious see it and then hide it!",1037318400,,1085,4.074766355140187
1352747,4,B00004TS0J,"Unless you're a Hammer Horror Fan, this is THE Horror Collection you were waiting for.
Good acting, mixed with good and chilling stories make these the one to own.
This is a TRILOGY. Unfortunately Fox Studios tried to rehash it for TV a fourth time without even coming near to the first and only three original ones. It is divided like an opera in three acts.
Remember that the Calibre of cast members in the first three ranges from Gregory Peck, Lee Remick, David Warner to William Holden, Lee Grant and finally Sam Neill.
A cast who could never be assembled for a TV movie.
The first act, ""The Omen"", is perhaps the best of the trilogy because it introduces us to the Evil one. The protagonists are as shocked and horrified when they learn, step by step as we do, who and what the Evil one is and is planning to do.
From there on we are involved in an intensive investigation and a race against time to save the world from what is to come, if at all possible...
The second act, ""Damien - Omen II"", is the natural evolution of the first one, in which we follow the growth in strength and power of Lucifer (or Satan if you prefer, although his name is never openly pronounced in all three movies). The interesting part is when the Evil one gets confirmation of who He really is and suddenly has a ""panic attack"" followed by sheer despair!
Act three, ""Omen III - The Final Conflict"", is the Apotheosis of the Trilogy in which Damien is at the top of the world, literally. He is finally ready to take possession of his Kingdom on Earth. People are ready, conditions are ready and it seems there's nothing able to stop him. Nothing, except...
Less gory than the Exorcist, The Omen Trilogy still has vicious and very graphic death scenes. The beauty of them is that there is no direct murder involved, at least not in the first two. They all happen by accident and very conveniently...
The Horror doesn't come in the form of monsters or monstruous beings, but is brought to us by angelic beings and ""natural"" coincidences, which make this even more controversial and eerie than any other Horror movie ever made.
Also consider the haunting Evil Messianic Chants for Choir and Full Symphonic Orchestra composed by Jerry Goldsmith for all three movies. They all are masterpieces in musical composition and if the movies won't scare you, then the music will.
Everything is well balanced. The acting, the stories, the effects and the music, they all promise you a true ride through Hell on Earth.
Definetly not for the faint-hearted. If you're easily scared by a door squeeking or a window lashing then forget all about it.
This trilogy can truly cause you nightmares without end.
Moreover, if you're the religious believer, be advised, this is nothing for you, even though references are just very loosely based on the Scriptures it still might cause you some problems.
For all the others, go ahead, make the Devil's Day!",1027382400,26,2913,4.6146435452793835
1352748,4,B00004TS0J,"I'm writing this review only to confirm what the other reviewers rightly said before me. The first 3 Omen movies in the collection make up a great horror trilogy. ""Omen 3: The Final Conflict"" is slightly disappointing compared to the previous two, but still manages to entertain.
Then comes ""Omen 4:The Awakening"". This made-for-tv horror movie should have never been made; it completely destroyed the whole series. Apart from the movie itself having many limitations, the plot does not even make sense. I mean, wasn't it supposed to be Judgement day at the end of ""Omen 3""? The second coming of Christ meant that Satan would be defintely destroyed; bringing a definite end to darkness and evil and a new beginning for humanity. This was completely ignored in ""Omen 4""; as was duly expected. Having the fourth installment in mind, obvious questions spring up; like ""Where did Christ go after ascending on Earth?"" ""Did he come for a vacation""? ""What actually happened on Judgement day?"" ""Was there even a judgement day""? Questions which certainly remain unanswered even by the creators of ""Omen 4"".
So if you are going to get this box set, don't expect much from no. 4. As a matter of fact, expect nothing from 4. I only bought this box set because of the nice packaging; otherwise I would have purchased Omen 1,2 and 3 seperately. The choice is yours; at least you were warned!",1022198400,5,1377,4.7899159663865545
1352749,4,B00004TS0J,"This collection is one that all those who love gothic style thrillers will enjoy. It features the nineteen seventy six blockbuster, ""The Omen"" and all its progeny.
THE OMEN - ***** STARS
This is the jewel in this collection. It is a first class, gothic thriller with an outstanding cast, a riveting story line, and a musical score that will make the viewer want to sleep with the lights on! A first rate film, it had audiences riveted to the screen when it was first released and has withstood the test of time, as it is as gripping today, as when it was first released.
David Seltzer wrote a terrific screenplay in which an older, affluent, and socially prominent couple, Kathy and Robert Thorn (Lee Remick and Gregory Peck), have a baby, whom they name Damien. The baby turns out to be the Anti-Christ, who ends up causing a lot of trouble. This first class production, which is deftly directed by Richard Donner, is played with straightforward sincerity by its outstanding cast. The casting of Gregory Peck and Lee Remick was pure genius, as their distinguished reputations infused the movie with a believability not thought possible, given the theme of the script. Playing it straight, as a couple caught in a vortex of events over which they have little control, they sweep the viewer along with them. Supported by a fine cast, there are notable performances given by Billie Whitelaw, as the nanny with a mission, David Warner, as the photographer who begins to notice that something odd seems to be going on, and Harvey Stephens, as Damien, whose angelic countenance belies his satanic nature.
This is a riveting, subtle film that, with a few well planned, shocking moments, and an effectively creepy musical score that builds suspense to a crescendo, manages to thoroughly engage the viewer. If one is looking for a blood and gore fest, there is really none of that here. Instead, look to be scared out of the seat of your pants by a superb script, wonderful acting, deft direction, and a musical score that will long linger in one's memory. It is little wonder that Jerry Goldsmith, the composer of the original score for The Omen, won an Academy Award for his efforts.
DAMIEN: OMEN II - **** STARS
This sequel, released two years after the blockbuster success of ""The Omen"", is itself a stylish thriller. Featuring an excellent cast, it attempts to continue the momentum of the original. While having some shortcomings, the film, nonetheless, manages to entertain and shock. This is due in large part to its excellent cast and another chilling musical score by Jerry Goldsmith that is used to great effect.
This film continues the story begun in ""The Omen"". The Antichrist, Damien (Jonathan Scott Taylor), is here on earth and is now twelve, a little older and a little wiser to his true nature. Damien is being raised by his uncle, Richard Thorn (William Holden) and his second wife, Ann (Lee Grant).
William Holden and Lee Grant are terrific. With straightforward, sincere portrayals, they are the linchpins of this movie. Jonathan Scott Taylor is good as Damien but not particularly charismatic. Well nuanced performances are given by Richard Foxworth and Lance Hendriksen, Damien's earthly sentinels. Old timer Lew Ayres is wonderful as the ethical business man, and Sylvia Sidney is terrific as the aunt who knows that there is something wrong with Damien. Lucas Donat is excellent as Damien's cousin Mark.
There is a surprising twist at the end of this film, that is sure to catch the viewer unawares. Still, that is not enough to make this sequel comparable to the original. It lacks the subtlety and deft direction of ""The Omen"". While the director, Don Taylor, does a competent job of directing this sequel, some of the scenes are heavy handed, giving in to special effects that detract from the film, rather than enhance it. The opening scene is a prime example of gratuitous excess. Less is sometimes more, something that the director, Don Taylor, should remember.
OMEN III: THE FINAL CONFLICT - *** STARS
This 1981 film is the second sequel to the oustanding, 1976 gothic thriller ""The Omen"". The Antichrist, Damien Thorn (Sam Neill), is now all grown up and, having inherited the entire Thorn family mega fortune, is now in the process of fulfilling both his destiny and a biblical prophecy of calamitous proportions. Unfortunately for him, however, his very existence is in jeopardy, as the second coming of Christ appears imminent.
Damien is kept busy in this film. As Ambassador to England, as well as spiritual leader to a denizen of devil worshippers, he is the target of an assassination plot by a group of priests led by Father DeCarlo (Rossano Brazzi). Damien keeps busy thwarting his would be assassins, usually by consigning them to a brutal demise. He also carries on a romance that ends badly. Damien is very much aware of who he is and where his destiny lies.
This is a relatively well acted film that suffers from a somewhat weak script. Sam Neill is well cast as the grownup Damien, giving a powerful performance. Rossano Brazzi is excellent as Father DeCarlo, the priest determined to end the stranglehold that the Antichrist has on the world. Composer Jerry Goldsmith contributes to the gothic atmosphere of the film with his chillingly creepy, musical score, just as he did in ""The Omen"" and in the first sequel. Due to its weak script, however, the film pales in comparison to its predecessors.
OMEN IV: THE AWAKENING - ** STARS

This 1991 made for television movie was certainly trying to capitalize on the popularity of the 1976 blockbuster film ""The Omen"" and the two sequels it spawned. It is not really a sequel. It tries to update the original story. This time the Anti-Christ a girl named Delia.
Unfortunately, the reality is that this film ends up being nothing like the original film upon which it is based. The plot becomes convoluted and ridiculous. In updating the story line, the writer brought in some new age gobbledegook that goes nowhere. The story, which starts out promisingly enough, degenerates into total absurdity and becomes unbelievable and downright laughable. Unlike the original, which was believable because of the subtlety that was employed through its straightforward presentation and deft direction, this film is anything but. Ham handedly directed and with a poor script with which to work, the actors cast never even had a chance. Consider this film just to be a bonus feature of this collection. I did not include it in the overall rating I awarded this set.
Only ""The Omen"" DVD in the only DVD in the set that can be said to be a loaded DVD with a lot of interesting features. It provides a forty six minute documetary on the making of the film, which is quite interesting, as well as a director's commentary. There is a also an intriguing, six minute short on some of the pitfalls that beset the cast and crew during the filming of the movie. The composer also has a small segment of his own. The DVD for ""Damien: Omen II"" features a comentary by producer Harvey Bernhard, while the DVD for ""Omen III: The Final Conflict"" has a commentary by the director Graham Baker. All four DVDs provide clarity of picure and sound, theatrical trailers, and subtitles in English and Spanish.",1020470400,84,7256,4.832797427652733
1352750,3,B00004TS0J,"The Omen trilogy (Omen 1, 2, and 3) is a great set of movies.  Even though 3 is a little watered down, it still rounds out the story.
Then the Omen 4 comes along.  Yes I know it was a made for TV thing, but come on, this is crap.
They should rename Omen 4 to ""Upside Down Cross Movie + Rehashed Omen Stuff"", because seriously, it was mainly about the makers of this movie trying to figure out how many times they can show an updside down cross (like it's all spooky and stuff).  They were probably just sitting around and going ""Hey, that stick over there kinda looks like an upside down cross... make the girl play with it and start shooting"".  Besides that all that was done was try to recreate old parts of the earlier Omen movies but with bad actors and without the subtlety that was one of the most important parts of the series.  Also they try to add in this stupid mumbo jumbo New Age crystal rubbing aura crap that is just lame.  The ""satanic"" choir of punk rockers also didn't do anything except make me laugh at the stupidity of it.  This could have been a good movie, but they ruined it.
Get the set for the first 3... it's worth it.  But only watch the last if you're drunk or something.",992390400,16,1199,4.182608695652174
1352751,5,B00004TS0J,"A movie with such a solid fundamental is very rare indeed. In the Omen series if we pay attention we realize the simple fact that when all things has gone wrong and evil seems to be winning there is always our Lord ""Jesus Christ"" who will help us and protect us. The satan have sent his child the ""anti Christ"" to destroy human kind and corrupt their souls with his lies. Many people say that this movie is about the ""anti Christ"" but according to me this movie is actually about ""God"" which means that this movie shows us that through His Son our Lord Jesus Christ God has Delivered us from our sins and He has given us another chance to repent our sins and accept the simple fact that it is from Him that we came from and to Him that we WILL go back to and no one can change that ""Not Even The Devil Himself"". In the Omen 3 - The Final Conflict the BEST scene from the whole movie according to me is the LAST scene of the movie after Damien have been defeated by our Lord Jesus Christ and the scene depicts Christ picking up the dead child and placing him near his mother although there were no dialogue in this scene but according to me this scene actually pictures Christ saying ""Forgive Them Father As They Know Not What They Do"".",981504000,2,1235,4.19327731092437
1352752,5,B00004TS0J,"Well, as another reviewer said, the made for TV Omen 4 does not belong in this set! As for the first three. The first was great, very creepy story about an evil young boy who would become the antichrist, and destroy anyone in his way. The second film was actually quite boring, almost like a slasher film. Long scenes of running around, resulting in a murder, over and over. The Final Conflict, the scene where the antichrist really gets going, was quite good. Especially the scenes where Sam Neil would express his feelings toward Christ in his private chambers. Very creepy and dramatic. One reviewer said the third one was the only one that seemed totally off from the biblical route. I thought that was kind of funny. None of these three movies are right on the biblical route, and Final Conflict was probably closest. To really see a realistic portrayal, rent Tribulation and Revelation, and the first of that trilogy...I don't remember the name because I haven't seen it yet. I HAVE seen Revelation and Tribulation though, and they are EXCELLENT examples of what the Bible predicts will be happening concerning the antichrist, most likely very soon. Also, catch Left Behind. The first and only one released so far, in a new series of movies. It's a bit preachy, but very good. There's also the Omega Code. Biggest budget so far, and once you get past the early bad acting, it gets pretty good. As for the Omen films, they're great antichrist movies, but they're purely fiction. Only a few scenes here and there in Omen 3 might be accurate. THey're best if viewed as horror films, in which case the first comes out on top.",980899200,7,1627,4.672473867595818

The second part is not as good as the first one , however it is above average,The best thing is the casting in the second part the actors and the actresses are really well acting in the movie. The third part is really good. Sam Neil was acting wonderful as The Evil's Son. Besides the ending of the third part is really unique Evil Versus Jesus. Really hot stuff. And the fourth part The Awekining is the worst of all.that part is really boring and bad cause it does not have anything that goes similiar with the first three parts but it worths to watch.
