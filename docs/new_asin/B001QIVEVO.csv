3765007,5,B001QIVEVO,"I could rave on about how much the 90's animated X-Men series did more justice to the X-Men mythos than any other animated interpretation, but doing so would only be a digression.  Instead, what I will say is that the episodes featured here in this second volume of episodes feature were prolific to say the least, including the concluding five-part spectacular The Phoenix Saga, which takes the X-Men on an interstellar trip to save the galaxy.  The team lineup remains the same, as the X-Men find themselves at a loss as Professor Xavier and Magneto are trapped in the Savage Land as Mr. Sinister's plot comes into fruition.  In between all that, Wolverine continues on Morph's trail, and has a run-in with old enemy Omega Red in Russia (during a team-up with Colossus!), and the team also gets trapped in Mojoworld with the demented TV mogul Mojo.  We learn more of various character's histories, including Gambit, Rogue, Beast, and Storm as well.  All in all, like Vol. 1, Vol. 2 of the 90's animated X-Men series is a must-own if you have fond memories of growing up with this series, and it remains the absolute best animated interpretation that Marvel's merry mutants have ever received.",1240617600,,1194,4.804878048780488
3765008,5,B001QIVEVO,So excited that these cartoons are FINALLY coming out on DVD! Truly one of the best cartoons from the 90's.,1239062400,,107,4.4
3765009,5,B001QIVEVO,"I have been waiting a longtime for these Marvel Comics X-Men animated series to be released on DVD! Finally, They will be released on April 28th, 2009!  This Marvel X-Men Volume 2 continues where X-Men Volume 1 left off. It will also have the Dark Phoenix Saga storyline in it. Jean Grey turns into an evil entity known as the Dark Phoenix. Only the X-Men and Professor X can save her. I recommend this DVD along with Marvel X-Men volume 1! If you remember the 1990's X-Men comics and cartoon, I Highly Recommend it!",1238025600,,516,4.48936170212766
3765010,5,B001QIVEVO,"In this one, we pick up where Vol. 1 left off! My rating, by the way, is based on the episodes and not the actual product:

Disc 1
Red Dawn - Omega Red makes his first appearance as he is unleashed to take back the Soviet Union only to turn on his allies! Meanwhile, Colossus recruits Jubilee and Wolverine to help free his family and country from this red menace!

Repo Man - In this mostly Wolverine episode, we get a lot back into his past as we see the experiment that gave him his adamantium claws and skeleton! We also meet Alpha Flight, who is assigned to get Wolverine back to Department H....by any means necessary!

X-Ternally Yours - In this one, we get a look into the past of Gambit as he is called back home to help his brother and the Guild of Thieves in a web of deception with the Guild of Assassins! We also see a past love of Gambit's named Belladonna who is a central part of this conflict and more revelations on his feelings for X-Man Rogue.

Time Fugitives (Parts 1 & 2) - In this one, both Cable and Bishop must travel back to the present day to help the X-Men investigate a mutant virus cooked up by the Friends Of Humanity (Marvel's version of the Klu Klux Klan). However, Cable WANTS the virus to occur while Bishop wants to stop it PERIOD! This brings Cable into conflict with both Bishop and Wolverine but there is a bigger threat than both the virus or even the FOH!

A Rogue's Tale - Ms. Marvel, the woman that Rogue took her powers and memories from, returns and tries to take over Rogue's mind and body forever!

Beauty & The Beast - In this one, Beast falls in love with one of his patients, must to the dismay of her bigoted father! Meanwhile, Wolverine discovers a clue to the leader of The Friends Of Humanity and that is a connection to one of Wolverine's foes!

Mojo Vision - In a wild ride, Cyclops, Wolverine, Jean Grey, Beast, Rogue and Storm are transported to the backwards realm of Mojo! In this one, we get a cameo appearance of The Punisher!

Disc 2
Reunion (Parts 1 & 2) - The X-Men finally find Charles Xavier while searching for Jean Grey! The trail takes them to the Savage Land where, to their horror, they have lost their mutant powers just like Magneto and Xavier himself! This two parter ends with a bang as the X-Men and Magneto (much like in ""The Final Decision"") band together to take on Mr. Sinister and his rogue mutant group.

Out of the Past (Parts 1 & 2) - Another Wolverine character ""comes out of the past"" as Lady Deathstrike (Wolverine's former lover in this version) wants revenge! This two parter also leads into the Phoenix Saga.

The Phoenix Saga (Parts 1-5) - Adapted from the classic series in the comics, The X-Men discover that an alien force called the Shi'ar is coming to earth not to take it over but to destroy both it and the universe in which it presides! To quote Beast ""Parting is all we know of heaven and all we need of hell"" as the ending is rather sad and does effect the series in future episodes.

This sees the first appearances of The Banshee, Black Tom as well as The Shi'ar characters! Also, we see returning is Dr. Moria Magtaggart and The Juggernaut.

Like Volume 1, definitely worth the purchase when it comes out!",1237939200,,3210,4.358458961474037
3765011,5,B001QIVEVO,"How ironic that it's being released days before the solo Wolverine movie!

Can't wait!",1236729600,,86,5.142857142857143
3765012,5,B001QIVEVO,"as others said, tv was just better in the 90's, its a simple fact. cartoons stand out even more. comparing Batman: The Animated Series to The Batman is such a joke its not even fair. they just ran out of ideas around 1999 or so and cartoons haven't had much to offer since.

finally, after waiting how many years, this classic show gets the treatment so many undeserving current shows have. this whole show was pure gold for the entire run, from the writing and art to the voice acting, there isn't one complaint to be had with this show.

3765013,5,B001QIVEVO,"Finally, fans of this show can own the classic episodes we grew up on and enjoyed. It's amazing to me how much more realisticly they tried to ground television series back then. This show imparticular went out of it's way to stick true to the comics it was based on, several major storylines were told in multi-part episodes too which is something I don't see as much anymore. I'm sure any fan will love this second volume as it contains the amazing Pheonix storyline. They tried to pull it off in 'X3: The Last Stand', and though I enjoyed it, for me they didn't manage to top the five parter that told the saga in this animated series. Episodes on this 2 disc volume include:

Red Dawn
Repo Man
X-Ternally Yours

There are no special features on this set and though I'd obviously love special features I'm willing to be happy with just the episodes if that's all they'll give us for now. I'm one of the people who hopes that good sales on these volumes will lead to the release of the others and possible special features in the future. I also hope that good sales on these sets could lead to the release of Marvel's 90's Spider-man series in sets like this.

Having now found the time to watch the DVD I want to say for those wondering that the video quality is near the same as I remember the original broadcast being. Any transfer issues are near unnoticeable to me and I am fairly particular about not being distracted by technical issues while watching my DVD. Obviously the animation quality is from the early nineties but really I find it surprisingly fairly on par with the new Wolverine and the X-men series. I found watching the episodes very nostalgic and find myself enjoying them in a whole new way now than I did when I was younger. I'm happy to see that the ""Previously on X-men"" openings are kept on the episodes and that the opening sequence and classic theme play before every episode unlike some other sets.

I also want to add that the box art is even better looking on the actual set than it is online. It comes with a cardboard slipcover over the DVD with an elevated foil colored version of the artwork on the DVD. At least Disney really made these look professional in the packaging department.

For those still wondering whether these sets are worth it I say buy them or at least the first volume to test it out, it's really only costing you a little more than a dollar an episode for these. Anyways, I'm just glad they're releasing this series and hope they finish releasing the entire 76 episodes this way (hopefully later on with some special features included). After all this time X-Men finally rises from the ashes and is reborn on an official DVD, I can't wait to rewatch the Dark Phoenix episodes that will be on the hopeful 3rd volume. Thanks For Your Time.",1234483200,55,3182,4.4604810996563575
3765014,5,B001QIVEVO,"X-Men is arguably one of the best animated shows based on a comic book series next to Batman the Animated Series and Spider-Man. X-Men debuted on Fox Kids in 1992. Fox Kids had the best shows in the world. X-Men ran for 76 episodes and is the longest show based on a Marvel comics(second was Spider-Man) and it was one of the longest-lasting series on Fox Kids, second only to Batman: The Animated Series.

The show was so ahead of it's time and is widely considered one of the best television adaptations of a comic series ever, often being compared to Batman: The Animated Series in terms of quality. In its prime, X-Men garnered very high ratings for a Saturday morning cartoon, and received wide critical praise for its portrayal of many different storylines from the comics.

IGN ranked X-Men as the 13th greatest animated show of all time in the Top 100 greatest animated TV shows.

The show features an X-Men similar in look and line-up to the early 1990s X-Men drawn by Jim Lee, composed of Cyclops, Wolverine, Rogue, Storm, Beast, Gambit, Jubilee, Jean Grey, Professor X, and as well as an original character, Morph. Though they were not part of the team as featured in the animated series, the following X-Men have all guest-starred in at least one episode: Colossus, Nightcrawler, Emma Frost, Forge, Havok, Polaris, Cannonball, Banshee, Iceman, Archangel, Longshot, Dazzler, Sunfire, Psylocke, Cable, and Bishop. Keen-eyed fans may also spot cameos by other familiar mutants, such as Feral or Rictor. One prominent character, Shadowcat, did not appear in the series in any way. Other lesser knowns characters such as Blink also made cameos. Classic villains such as Magneto, Mr. Sinister, Sabertooth, Sauron, Red Dawn and Apocalypse also made appearances.

A number of famous storylines and events from the comics are loosely adapted in the series, such as the Dark Phoenix Saga, Days of Future Past, the Phalanx Covenant, and the Legacy Virus. The third episode, ""Enter Magneto,"" features a confrontation at a missile base: this is largely based on the X-Men's first battle with Magneto, as told in their 1963 debut X-Men #1. The season four episodes ""Sanctuary, Parts I & II,"" which involve Magneto creating an orbiting haven for mutants, were influenced by several storylines from the comics, chiefly the first three issues of X-Men (Volume 2) and the ""Fatal Attractions"" crossover.

This show has many mature themes that you don't see very often in animated shows such as divorce (""Proteus""), Christianity (""Nightcrawler"" & ""Bloodlines""), the Holocaust (""Enter Magneto,"" ""Deadly Reunions,"" ""Days of Future Past,"" and ""The Phalanx Covenant""), AIDS hysteria (""Time Fugitives""), and even satires of television itself (""Mojovision"" and ""Longshot""). The Friends of Humanity, a prominent anti-mutant group that appears in the second season, bears great resemblance to the Ku Klux Klan and other white-supremacy groups. Adult sexual themes are also explored: in ""Till Death Do Us Part,"" Morph shapeshifts into Rogue to attract Gambit, and in ""Whatever It Takes,"" he morphs into Jean Grey, to manipulate Wolverine's emotions. Likewise, Mystique would often shapeshift into, and flirt with, men and women.

This show is very dark, deep, emotional and very mature. You don't see any of that in any of today's cartoons. If you watch Pokemon, or any of the cartoons pushed out today, you ""stupify"" yourself. But if you watch shows from the 80s/90s like X-Men, you bring yourself up.

But the only thing that bothers me is that Disney released the entire series of the Spider-Man 1967 series and the Fantastic Four 90s animated series. So why can't they do the same thing for X-Men, Spider-Man and the rest of the Marvel shows?

Here's the list of episodes per disc.

Disc. 1.
Red Dawn:Collosus return's to ask the X-Men for help tackling one of Wolverine's old foes in Russia, the diabolical Red Dawn.

Repo Man:Wolverine is kidnapped by Alpha Flight, a group of Government operated superpowered Canadian's whom Wolverine abandoned to join the X-Men. They wish to learn how he survived the procedure which gave him his adamantium skeleton, no matter the cost.

Beauty And The Beast:Beast falls in love with one of his blind patients Carly, who is the daughter of a mutant-hater. Meanwhile, Wolverine infiltrates the Friends of Humanity headquarters.

Mojovision:The X-Men are trapped in an alternate reality and are made to risk their lives as characters of a TV show in an attempt to attract ratings for Mojo.

Disc. 2.
Reunion parts 1 and 2:Morph lures the X-Men into a trap and Jean is kidnapped, whilst Xavier and Magneto meet the new master of the prehistoric Savage Land. In part 2, the X-Men are finally reunited with Xavier, whilst Mr. Sinister finally reveals his plans for them.

The Phoenix Saga Part One, Sacrifice:Xavier sends the X-Men into space on a mission of extreme importance after he begins to suffer from vivid dreams of an alien world.

3765084,4,B001QIVEVO,"While this volume is still great this is some of the least liked episodes in the series before season 5 which was mostly weird, look reunion, I love sinister he's my favorite x-men villain and while they did a good job keeping the continuity for this story, I'm just not a fan, in fact anytime they go to the savage land I just don't like it. While Mojovision does have a good story and the idea is great, none of it matters really if the character your focusing on has an annoying voice, sure that may have been what they were going for, but in Wolverine and the X-men I really liked a voice, so good writing bad voice direction. But besides those this volume is really good with some of my favorite's of the series with Rogue's tale and Beauty and the Beast.

3765109,5,B001QIVEVO,"I will say this, I'm very impressed by the quality of the DVD. I was expect a lot less from something so out dated. They converted the original 4x3 aspect ratio to 16x9 so it looks perfect on you new TV. Even though the show was not originally in HD the re-mastering still shows. The picture looks and sounds great for something that was released in the early 90's.

  I bought all the Volumes to get me hyped for the new X-Men movie. Since I receive my collection I've been watching non-stop. There are more episode than I remember, which is great because I don't think I had a chance to see them all when it was on TV. All the episodes are in order too, that's awesome because that was the biggest problems I had with the show when it was still on TV!

  If you're having a sense of nostalgia, I highly recommend getting this DVD. It brought back so many memories, and lets face facts, we all tried to be Wolverine while sliding three knives between our fingers as a kid. Even if you weren't around for the Animated Series but are a fan of the movies, it's good to see where the X-Men films stem from. It's also good to see what it is that's getting all the older generation so upset every time the movie go off course lol.

  To the parents out there, this show still holds up, it's not like it's in Black and White. I favored the show as a kid, and I still favor it as an adult (I consider myself a cool guy lol). I'm definitely introducing X-Men to my kids too.",1402876800,,1466,4.170212765957447

3765114,5,B001QIVEVO,Growing up in the 90's was awesome. There were so many great cartoons that were out and this X-Men series was one of them. I remember me and my brother used to race downstairs to watch X-Men when Fox aired it on Saturday mornings. The storyline had us hooked every Saturday we had to be back for the next episode. Now as an adult I can go back and reminisce just a little bit with this DVD. All the original episodes are here and the DVD box is cool as hell...

3765131,5,B001QIVEVO,"Volume 2 of my favorite Marvel & superhero show contains rest of the second season, as well as the first 7 episodes of the third season.  The second season is my personal favorite, & the 10 episodes here are precisely why.  All 5 seasons are good, but the overarching storyline as well as some incredibly good spotlight episodes that focus on the other X-Men as well as Wolverine make this season my favorite.  Here's a review of the episodes, with synopsizes from Marvel Animation Age.

17.  Red Dawn:  Omega Red, the ultimate living weapon, is resuscitated by three corrupt generals who want to reclaim and rule the crumbling old Soviet empire.  Colossus approaches the X-Men for help to save his country from these forces of tyranny.  With the help of Darkstar and Colossus, the X-Men must defeat the seemingly unbeatable Omega Red and restore peace in Russia.  Colossus' second episode is even better than his first.  A+

18.  Repo-Man:  Vindicator and Alpha Flight capture Wolverine and demand to know the secret of his Adamantium skeleton.  This is possibly my favorite spotlight on Wolverine.  A+

19.  X-Ternally Yours:  Gambit is forced to return to his southern roots by an ancient tithe, an old family feud and the kidnapping of his brother, Bobby. Bella Donna of the Assassin's Guild uses the kidnapping to lure Gambit into her clutches and force him into completing the aborted marriage.  Gambit's only episode seems to be a really good example of a ""love it or hate it"" episode in a certain fanbase.  Personally, I love it.  A+

20-21.  Time Fugitives:  It's 3999 AD. In New York City Nate Summers, also known as Cable, is leading a war against Apocalypse and his forces. But when a timestorm appears, Cable discovers that the past is being altered by the mutant known as Bishop and that these alterations will cause the destruction of the mutant race.  This is my favorite of the epsiodes with Bishop, particularily since we learn the origin of Cable (as well as who his parents are in this continuity).  A+

22.  A Rogue's Tale:  When Mystique forces Rogue to revisit her own past, Rogue's overpowering flashbacks cause her to relive the encounter with Ms. Marvel and drive her from the X-Men.  Rogue struggles with Ms. Marvel's thoughts which are trapped in her mind and they battle it out on the psychic plane.  My favorite Rogue episode.  I always wondered how she got the ability to fly, & this perfectly answered my question.  A+

23.  Beauty & the Beast:  Beast falls in love with Carly, a blind patient of his.  The two are kept apart by Carly's father who looks down upon the mutant race.  But when the Friends of Humanity kidnap Carly, her father turns to Beast who must now risk his life to try and save her.  Beast's only real spotlight is definitely his best.  This is just a wonderful, touching episode.  A+

24.  Mojovision:  An alien, Mojo, kidnaps and casts the X-Men in his latest all galaxy television hits.  This is a weird episode, but it's also very funny, with a plot very similar to the comics.  A+

25-26.  Reunion:  Xavier and Magneto are held captive by Mister Sinister and are used as bait to the lure the X-Men into an ambush at his Savage Land castle.  This is one of my top 5 stories in the whole series.  It's an awesome finale, and Rogue & Gambit get to kiss each other when they lose their powers!  A+ just for that!

27-28.  Out of the Past:  When Wolverine's former love, a Japanese woman named Yuriko, stumbles into the Morlock tunnels, she discovers that an alien treasure is buried somewhere in the area.  She lures Wolverine and the X-Men into the tunnels with hopes that she can use their abilities to uncover the treasure.  This is another really good Wolverine episode.  A+

29-33.  The Phoenix Saga:  A Shi'ar emissary, Erik the Red, violently takes over the Eagle One space station.  The X-Men race into space to save the astronauts on board and battle Erik the Red.  But on the way back to Earth, an energy wave collides with their aircraft.  With no other options, Jean takes matters into her own hands and pilots the plane while shielding the rest of the X-Men, exposing herself to some strange energy that transforms herself into the Phoenix.  This is one of the best 5-part stories I've seen of any show. The first episode is good though it is a little slow, but after that it gets really good.  A

One of my favorite things about this volume is that I saw all of these episodes on TV, sometimes twice.  By far the best thing about the first movie was that its popularity inspired Fox to rerun this cartoon.  I remember channel surfing one day & then I'm like ""X-Men is back!  OMG!"".  So me & later my whole family (who enjoyed X-Men at the time) & even a friend of my parents who was visiting sat down & watched all the episodes on here.  Some of them I vividly remembered seeing back when they first aired (Repo Men & Out of the Past particularly) whiel others I saw but thought I dreamt up like Reunion.  I remembered seeing an episode where Morph was alive, but Mr. Sinister was so creepy to me I thought it was a nightmare.  This one of the best volumes I have of any TV show.  17 episodes & not even one that I would rank below A (except for the first part of the Phoenix Saga, but still).  If you're an X-Men fan, you must buy this set.",1368835200,,5308,4.531712473572939

Other episodes on Volume 2 range from very good to poor. Volume 2 has 17 episodes in all, spread over 2 discs, and no extra features. Overall, it's not as good as ""X-Men: Vol. 1"". These cartoons feature many of the best X-Men team members, including Wolverine, with great voice actors and character development. They have great stories, many taken from the best X-Men comic books. They also have great action, with battles against some of the best X-Men villains. The animation is just TV quality, but it's still okay. Reviewed 3/12/2009 based on my vivid memories of watching repeatedly on TV when it first aired.",1326758400,,806,4.643356643356643

Again, my personal favorite heroes are now and probably always will be Gambit and Rogue (Morph as well) and I couldn't be happier that these two were given their spotlight episodes in Season 2; especially since both character were tragically underused post-Season 2 (Gambit: ""X-ternally Yours; Rogue: ""A Rogue's Tale."") Similarly, ""Red Dawn"" delved deep into fan favorite, Wolverine's past and spotlighted his spotty relationship with Alpha Flight and Department H. Even Beast was allowed the spotlight episode, ""Beauty & the Beast"" (my personal favorite episode on this volume, along with ""Xternally..."") All of this; and ""The Phoenix Saga!""

It's filled with action, adventure, and incredibly mature story lines that deal with oppression, isolation, and prejudice that made the X-Men Comic books so popular. You almost forget that you're watching a cartoon made for a younger audience.

X-MEN VOL. 2... continues the cliffhanger from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Men-Volume-1-Marvel-DVD-Comic-Book-Collection/dp/B001QIVEVE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X-Men, Volume 1 (Marvel DVD Comic Book Collection)</a>&nbsp;and ends with the five-part ""The Phoenix Saga.""

This volume concludes season 2 and although the last episode isn't necessarily a cliffhanger, you can't help but wonder what's going to happen next.

Can't wait for the remaining seasons!",1241913600,,2194,7.047794117647059
3765183,3,B001QIVEVO,"For most of my thoughts on the release of this show please see my review of the first set.  My score takes into account the DVD's lack of special features and visual quality, but the rest of this written review is for the episodes contained herein.

The first set concluded with the third episode of season 2 (""Whatever it Takes"") and volume 2 picks up from there.  Season 2, like season 1, had episodes that all ran together though here the gap in time between episodes is not always clear.  Connecting them all together is the absence of Professor Xavier and clips of he and Magneto's trials in The Savage Land are found in each episode before the storyline comes to a conclusion in the two-part ""Reunion.""  The villain Mr. Sinister also appears throughout as it becomes clear he has a heavy influence on the happenings of season 2.

Sinister was a relatively new villain at the time of this show's creation and season 2 is pretty topical in that regard.  Omega Red is featured here and he was almost brand new at the time of the episode's creation.  If that displeased some longtime fans, they were rewarded with the five part Phoenix Saga that concludes the set.  The Phoenix Saga here obviously needed to be reworked (after all, a completely different team of X-Men existed at the time in the comics) but it is mostly faithful.  Some other comic book plots are carried over such as The Plague and Wolverine's past dealings with Department H but altered to better fit the animated series continuity.

An interesting trend was also started where a new character each week got his or her own episode.  For characters like Rogue and Gambit, an origin story was presented where their past caught up to them (as opposed to having a flashback episode).  For a character like Beast, the episode ""Beauty and the Beast"" merely serves to give us a better understanding of that character's relationship with the world and his teammates.  They're all nicely done and are effectively dramatic (especially the Rogue and Beast ones).  Wolverine is featured quite heavily ( as always) with him playing a significant role in just about every episode.  For someone who likes Wolverine, even I can get a bit annoyed but at the same time no character feels too neglected save for maybe Jean and Cyclops, but both end up being huge players in The Phoenix Saga so all is forgiven.  And while I enjoy some episodes more than others, there really isn't a bad one here.  If I had to pick a least favorite it would be ""Mojovision"" as I've never cared for the Mojo character, but that episode is a bit slapstick and is a nice break from the heavy serious tone of the other episodes.  My favorite is probably ""Beauty and the Beast"" as it's an easy episode to relate to and puts the show's civil right's issues on stage in a tasteful way.

It should also be noted, the show sees a change in visual quality with the ""Out of the Past"" episodes.  The colors are richer and more black outlines are used giving the show a more ""toon"" quality.  Whether you like the style is a matter of opinion, but the animation itself is of higher quality.  This may have been due to the fact that these two episodes originally aired in prime time and were used to hype the upcoming Phoenix Saga.  The Phoenix Saga episodes seemed to tone down this new look, but the animation remained improved over the first two seasons.

Needless to say, if you bought volume 1 it makes no sense to not get volume 2.  The quality of the episodes is just as good and if you can get past the lack of any kind of bells and whistles with these releases this volume is a good buy.  If you haven't purchased volume 1 yet, I recommend getting them both at the same time through Amazon as you end up paying less than a dollar per episode (if you go with super saver shipping).  This show is still the best animated series from Marvel and deserves a spot in any comic book fan's library.  Now, please Disney, give us the rest of the episodes!",1241827200,10,3974,4.503486750348675
3765194,5,B001QIVEVO,"In 1992, the ""X-Men"" animated series aired on television and suffice to say, the series was a tremendous hit.

Considering what was going on behind-the-scenes at the time, especially on the comic book end of things.  Comics had a resurge in popularity and popular artist Jim Lee would bring new life into the X-Men comic books by giving them new costumes, bringing an edge to the way the characters were drawn and a new comic book spinoff in the X-Men universe.

In fact, the X-Men comic books reached such an all time high in popularity that there were more spinoff series than any super hero title and fans actually bought them all up.

The series was a big hit for FOX KIDS during the Saturday morning block but because the series captured the heart and soul of the comic books (with slight differences in storyline and actual continuity), fans young and old were watching the ""X-MEN"" animated series.

With the first volume, we watched as the X-Men had to face against intolerance towards mutantkind and having to face off against Magneto.  This time around, the storylines now come closer to what is happening on the comic side of things during the early to mid-90's.

This second volume is full of non-stop action and each episode filled with thrilling episodes plus more characters from the Marvel Universe and battles galore!

Here is a summary of what to find on both discs for ""X-MEN"" Volume 2.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""X-MEN"" the animated series is presented in full screen (1:33:1).  One thing that you will notice is that the animation does show its age.  Since the animation was created over 17-years ago, a lot of the animation is hand drawn and compared to many of the digital animated series that are show on television today, the animation doesn't have that digital color vibrancy as newer animations.  But like many older animations from the 80's and the 90's, especially for superhero-based storylines, the strength lies within the storytelling.

At that time, the animation was quite exciting for any of us who were fans of the comic book series but watching it today, you realize that the series does show its age.

As for audio, audio is presented in Dolby Digital Surround Sound and is dialogue-driven.  I wasn't expecting any 5.1 surround sound but audio dialogue is heard quite clearly.  If anything, I have to say that the English dubwork was very good for the series.  From Wolverine's scruffy voice, Rogue's southern accent and Remy Lebeau's Louisiana/French style of talking, I've always felt that the ""X-Men"" was well-cast for the animated series.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

There are no official special features in relation to the X-MEN animated series but trailers for newer releases from Disney.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I was among the big X-Men fans who were highly anticipating the series and just loved it!  As a collector of the X-Men comic books around that time period, to have a series based on Jim Lee's character designs and a series with so much potential of showcasing a variety of enemies and characters, it was always a treat to find out who would be introduced in each episode.

As the first volume was quite exciting at the time, especially how  it took popular storylines from the comic books such as the Mutant Registration Act and Apocalypse Four Horseman chapters, bringing in characters such as Archangel and Cable vs. Bishop.  For an X-Men comic book fan, this was magnificent!

I found the second volume even more exciting as it introduces more villains such as Omega Red, the Canadian superhero team Alpha Flight, more Cable and Bishop and the virus storyline which was a big part of the comic book series at that time, Mojo and Long Shot, the Savage Land storyline featuring Ka-Zar and Shanna the She-Devil and of course, one of the biggest X-Men related storyline, the Phoenix Saga.

This second volume of ""X-MEN"" is absolutely jam packed with action and characters from the X-Men and Marvel universe that this animated series does not disappoint.  Of course, there are differences between the animated version and the comic books but overall, the series stays close to the heart of what the X-Men and its characters are all about.

More action, more battles and more mutant mayhem, ""X-MEN"" the animated series volume 2 is definitely worth checking out!",1241568000,10,7619,4.65990990990991
3765195,5,B001QIVEVO,"1st I don't really mind the DVD being so simple I'm just glad X-Men is out on DVD. Hope the 1990's Spider-Man Animated Series comes out soon! But don't sleep on this DVD, if your a X-Men you have to get it.",1241481600,,206,3.9285714285714284
3765196,3,B001QIVEVO,"Well, it's time for an actual DVD review.  Who's with me?  Ya there?  Good.  Okay, I'm gonna break it down here with a little intro - I'm a little young (15) to remember when this show started, I lived off scattered reruns.  I enjoyed what I saw greatly - while the animation style wasn't stunning like Batman TAS, it felt like watching a comic book come to life - which caught my attention.  So, I'm gonna break it down for ya.

VIDEO: 3/5
Well, this is a mixed bag.  I don't care that there's been no remastering, because I like it when a show retains its retro look (it's something Disney needs to remember for their movies when they ""remaster"" them).  However, bad interlacing causes ""ghosting"" - which is where during high-action scenes the frames seem to blend together in such a way that a brief after-image is often present.  Very distracting, especially when you go from episode-to-episode and find one look great, hope the next will, and get hit with disappointment.  Bitrate is good though, compression seems minimal.

AUDIO: 4/5
Well, it's no remaster.  But it does the job.  3 tracks to select from, English French & Spanish I believe.  Each does its job, and it seems the music is quiet in all of them but the english.

EXTRAS: 0/5
Oh wait, what extras?  I find it hillarious that they put a commentary disclaimer and didn't bother to get anyone do do one - not even on the Phoenix Saga, arguably the series' most famous arc.

DVD ITSELF: 2/5
Well... disc one works in one of three DVD players, and disc 2 works on (as of the ones I've tried) only a PC and a PS3.  This is outright embarrassing for Disney, as it's something I'd expect from a bootleg - not a legitimate product!  Also, it appears that there's over 99 video titles - what a waste of space!  Each episode is spread out into titles rather than chatpers, understandably, but when I examine the VTS files on the DVDs there's just so many that it becomes ridiculous!  And there's only about 8 episodes on each disc, so it makes no sense.  Plus, no one is going to enjoy your Hamster movie Disney, so stop forcing your ads for it on our DVDs.  One last thing - cover art is just as amazing as it appears on the internet.

Then, the last two important questions:

1.  Is the set uncut?
-It appears to be so, other than the fact that they used the edited version of the Lady Deathstrike episode.  For those unfamiliar, the white undershirt was requested by FOX after the episode slipped through with only her outer dress - thus, showing a little too much cleavage for their tastes.  Understandable, and I can't complain; if they'd only made the change now, I'd be going crazy.  Also, the show's pacing seems off a few times, which may make you think it is edited; however, that's just the structure of a few episodes. Another thing is that unless in a large saga (and even in some of the two-parters), the flashbacks seen in ""previously on x-men"" sequences are character-based rather than production-based; so you might see something looking unfamiliar, because it happened more episodes back than the set.

So if you don't wanna read all this, then yes.

2.  Is it worth it?
-A die-hard fan may want to wait and see if Buena Vista decides to come out with another one.  However, for someone looking for a quick nostalgia trip, this is perfect - and the price can't be beat by legitimate means.  The average consumer probably wont' complain.

Hopefully, I've answered some of the common questions.

Also, despite what I say here, buy this set.  Maybe it'll convince Disney to not stop the sets mid-series like they did with Gargoyles.",1241308800,8,3606,4.541925465838509

3765198,4,B001QIVEVO,"I will not spend any time elaborating on the importance of this pivotal superhero animated series since anyone visiting this page undoubtedly knows that already. However, since many DVD sets have been issued in edited form over the years, I felt it necessary to alleviate any concerns of the same being true of this release. The episodes on this set clock in at around 21mins 30secs each, which is the correct full length. A handful of early episodes had incomplete animation that was only seen in the original airing and corrected by the original animation studio ever since, which is what are on these discs.  In addition, these episodes are arranged by production order and not broadcast order, thus the chronology of the storylines are not disjointed.

This series is one of the few where having the original broadcast versions is not better. So many of those early episodes aired initially with incomplete special effects shots, coloring mistakes, dialogue sync errors, poorly animated scenes, and so forth. While such issues were eventually corrected and finalized in subsequent airings, the fear has remained that a studio releasing this series on DVD would issue the flawed original versions. Luckily, Disney seems to have done their homework with this release even though the series was not treated to a full video and audio restoration job or extras (thus, a star deduction).  BOTTOM LINE: Disney has issued the corrected versions of certain episodes that originally aired with animation errors and NOT the edited for time syndicated reruns.",1241222400,7,1551,5.122529644268774
3765199,4,B001QIVEVO,"FINALLY! I've been wanting the forever! but i wish i was released in a better way. like season one style with FEATURES! and maybe an insert for the dates of the releases for the rest of the volumes!!!

also... why is nightcrawler on the cover, he's not in any of these episodes on either disc. That's just dumb to me.",1241136000,2,317,4.283333333333333
3765200,4,B001QIVEVO,long awaiting this set... but is Marvel going to screw us over again and not release the last season of the series like they did with X-men Evolution?,1241049600,,150,4.392857142857143
3765201,1,B001QIVEVO,"As most every fan out there, I have been waiting YEARS for this amazing series to be released in full on DVD, not an episode here and there, but full seasons. Well it's finally been released! Well don't get too excited now like I did, you're in for a BIG disappointment. Although these are the episodes, in correct order, they are EDITED AND CUT! These are NOT the full length original airing of the episodes. These are more like the re-run versions. Just like The Simpsons, the re-run episodes on TV are cut for time length from the original episodes. I guess the ""new episode"" airing time for shows have less commercial time, I do not not. What I know is this, just like when watching other shows on ABC Family, TBS, even FOX and etc, the original airing of each new show has MORE than the re-run version. This brand new DVD set is just like watching the re-runs on TV. So if you simply want (as I did) the 1990s version of the X-Men, go ahead and buy both of these volumes; but if you're looking for the full length 24-26 minute unedited, uncut versions...keep waiting. Maybe one day, SOMEONE will produce this wonderful series the RIGHT WAY!",1240963200,6,1145,4.457142857142857
3765202,1,B001QIVEVO,"The one star rating isn't for this amazing 90's series itself, it is for Disney/Buena Vista for their handling of such a possibly lucrative product. This DVD release is about 6 years past due, and judging by the quality of it and lack of special features I can't see what took them so long to get it released, maybe they were waiting for a deal on DVD-RW's, I'm not entirely sure. Either way, this is a bare bones terrible transfer of a beloved series. After years of online petitioning and e-mails the fans are given this sad excuse for a DVD collection.

The discs contain 8 episodes, yes, 8, thats right, 8! And its not like the saved room on the disc is utilized in a reasonable fashion like a high transfer, stunning special features, commentary, character gallery, or even a post 1990 DVD menu. This DVD release is like buying a burnt copy of the series online or at a convention, however the only difference is those releases at least have an excuse for looking terrible, Buena Vista has no excuse. I am sure that in 4 years there will be a decent release of this awesome series. However, with that said avoid this release at all costs and send a message to Disney/Buena Vista that this low-quality bare bones slap in the face to fans everywhere just won't cut it. By the way, Buena Vista is also holding Spider-Man from the 90's captive as well, which I'm sure when Spider-Man 4 hits theatres will get this same terrible release. Buena Vista should take a page out of Warner Home video in their release/treatment of Batman the Animated Series.

Shame on you Disney/Buena Vista, shame on you.",1240876800,11,1599,4.548611111111111
3765203,5,B001QIVEVO,"At last, one of the finest series ever to hit animation has come home to us. Marvel's X Men the Animated Series Vols 1 & 2 bring to life the comic book as few other series did.  These volumes, especially the second, display the depth of these characters and the fine animation quality that made this series a hit.  I am delighted to add these to my library.

But let us be clear, here.  The first volume finishes into the second season.  The second volume takes us through the rest of season two and into season three.  But the second volume does NOT complete the third season.

And that leaves us with and unfinished season three, PLUS season four and five!  Granted, after the Dark Phoenix Saga the episodes were shown more randomly and few were in order.  However now we should benefit with further DVDS that allow us to see the remaining shows in order.

So I encourage everyone to buy Vol 1&2 but realize there must be more to come.  PLEASE RELEASE THE REMAINING EPISODES.  For us, the X-Men true followers, if you release it, we will buy and thank you.",1240876800,10,1058,4.424870466321243
