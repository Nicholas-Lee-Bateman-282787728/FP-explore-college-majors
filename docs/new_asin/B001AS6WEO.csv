1) (VOICE) ACTING: I thought that the voices were done very well, with the exception of the female character, Jen. I'm guessing that one of the two MALE voice actors did her voice with the aid of a sped up tape recorder(?). It was horrible. Jen's voice was like that of one of Alvin & the Chipmunks, and it just wasn't good at all. I found it difficult to understand what the character was saying at times. I realize that Mr. Sudol wanted to keep a tight rein on control of this project, but in my opinion, a female voice actor should've been hired for the part of Jen.

2) PRODUCTION: The animation has improved from the first feature (City of Rott). I really found nothing to complain about as the sound effects, background music and animation were great.

3) THE CAUSE: You'll have to watch and find out yourself!

4) THE ZOMBIES: Well, as in other movies of its type, (the Evil Dead trilogy, The Demons trilogy) the big debate will continue on. Was it zombies, or was it demon possessed dead people returning from the grave? You decide.

5) NUDITY: None.

FINAL: Overall, this is a fun movie. Dead Fury is filled with enough sarcasm and humor to tickle anyone's funny bone. The director obviously loves the genres that he is parodying, and it shows. In lesser hands, this could have been another spoof gone bad. Other than the character of Jen's voice, I really found little in this movie that I didn't Like.
