8348077,1,B001D2WUBQ,"It's hard to find wholesome movies these days that don't glorify the hook-up mentality promoted in most Hollywood movies, and I thought that this movie, created for Black Christian Movies, would be a breath of fresh air.  It wasn't!

Yes, the heroine prays and quotes thoughts from the Bible, but she never applies those thoughts to her own life.  She's eager and ready to accept gifts from the men who date her, to kiss on the first date, to ""try out"" her true love by inviting him to move in with her (and then agonizing because he won't take the next step to marriage). I guess that's why the box notes describe her as ""sophisticated.""

Her friends were hardly better - her best friend's husband goes along on a pick-up with his two pals and three women they just met in a bar.  Eventually he comes to his senses, but why did he go in the first place?

The movie looks as if it were made in a few days with a hand-held camcorder.  The plot took huge leaps - the hero and heroine must be mind-readers because they discovered their love for each other without speaking a word!  I would give the movie zero stars if Amazon would allow such a rating.

The two subplots about the married friend and the divorced friend appear to be added merely to stretch the movie to 88 minutes.

This movie was a waste of an hour and a half of my family's time that we will never retrieve. Learn from our suffering and do not buy or rent this movie.",1237075200,3,1433,4.313432835820896
