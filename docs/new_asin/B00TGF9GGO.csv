7007213,5,B00TGF9GGO,"I saw this movie on HBO when I was in a hotel.  I was 100% riveted from beginning to end.  It would have been a good movie if it were fiction, but the fact that it's all footage makes it ultra eye opening.  If you followed the Snowden saga from from the perspective of the news media it makes this story ever more interesting.  To me this is the documentary of the century, not just the year.  I will be buying immediately when it is available.",1428969600,100,444,4.116279069767442
7007214,5,B00TGF9GGO,One of the most important films ever made on.life and times of Edwin Snowden who not.exposed the truth but the hypocrisy of NSA and showed what they do to keep him from telling the truth and.let us all know no one is safe. The interview and style.made it seem.like we were there and felt the drama on his venture to stop and protection of all of our rights.,1428364800,7,357,4.264705882352941

7007216,3,B00TGF9GGO,"This video dragged on in his hotel room while Snowden was coming out. He is the second 21st-century prisoner of conscience after Julian Assange. These two men are being hounded out of existence by the US government. I wonder why there are not more people like these two men. More evidence that the United States' government is souring and going bad. It is interesting to see how Snowden is outwitting the authorities and to see the courage of those who are on his side. I imagine that there are a lot of cowards lying about their own activities in this country and elsewhere-a lot. I have to thank Amazon for having this video to freely show our citizens. At great cost, Snowden and Assange are not afraid to speak out for the value of personal freedom, which is now called privacy.",1521158400,,782,4.553191489361702

It seems like half the time he is trying to plant sentences into Edward, so that he will speak them, so that Glenn can say that he spoke them. I support Edward Snowden and the movement he helped start but something about Glenn's journalism style just seemed off, or a bit dishonest, or too agenda driven, I am not sure - but I did not like that - if anything harms the truth.",1506384000,,631,4.096774193548387

But hat he failed to predict is that NO ONE CARES anymore.  While the NSA, etc. may have temporarily stopped the data gathering that Snowden exposed, who's to say they are no still doing it?  And how would you even know?

The first person perspective made me feel like I was a fly on the wall before Edward Snowden made the leaks to the press in Hong Kong. It was exhilarating to see the emotions of everyone from Snowden to the brave journalists publishing stories of the different illegal government programs that were found in the leaks documents.

Thank you Laura Poitras for capturing live footage of the events in Hong Kong that lead to the publication of these illegal programs before Gleen Greenwald went on live news to explain what was going on.

7007264,1,B00TGF9GGO,"Hero-worship of this scoundrel earns people a ticket on the short bus. Snowden was a spy posing as a whistle-blower. Sad that so many buy into the lie. Privacy was never the issue, only the distraction.

For an excellent account of this cheesy weasel's backstory, see Edward Epstein's _How America Lost Its Secrets: Edward Snowden, the Man and the Theft_, available on Amazon. Reading between the lines, one could conjecture that Snowden was ""turned"" as an agent while working in Switzerland, and that his CIA career-ending ""DEROG"" may have come from failing to pass his polygraph test regarding contact with non-American operatives. The official word, as per Epstein, is that Snowden was politely pushed into resignation for messing with computer code. Read and make up your own mind.

In any event, the REAL failure here was that Snowden was allowed a grace period in retaining his security clearance, a measure brought about by Obama's CIA budget cuts that was intended to help former employees find other work. That''s why Dell hired him after he was forced to resign from the CIA.",1492473600,,1085,4.988950276243094

Newsflash: every single thing you do online or with your electronic payment methods or cellphone is recorded and available to US intel agencies or law enforcement.

The film tries to play up this information as being somehow dramatic or amazing, but anyone who has been paying attention for the past 40 years or so won't be surprised. I guess if you haven't been aware of this information the film may seem revelatory, but you could watch a more entertaining version like ""Enemy of the State"" from 1998 or whenever and come away with the same info.",1490227200,,616,4.590909090909091

7007280,5,B00TGF9GGO,"I think this was as good as the movie!
It was very personal and also.very intense!
Will someone come through that Hotel door?
Was very nerve racking and the guy is so sweet.
He certainly changed for the better and at a huge price! To himself. Though I am guessing his girlfriend Beas very proud of him as he seemed to from movie got and gave credit to her for him becoming more liberal and more open minded.
Yet his high morals would have not let him not
Do what he did for all of us!!
I have my on shame while dealing with the legal system that ruined my life though I was diagnosed with Mutiple trauma when it lasted four years turning an accident into a crime and ruined my life but yes I was ""reflexively"" toward the lawyer and powers against me many times.
So now being a Thomas Jefferson lover I have a
Billboard of summer tees to wear and this one by Thomas Jefferson I failed but now recovering from injustice and mental illness caused by traumas and wrongful accusations. This has now become my favorite to fight for.
""When injustice become law. Resistance becomes Duty""
By Thomas Jefferson.
And I am trying my best to use my imagination to
Get the truth publicized cause  I know I am just one person out of probably thousands that were coerced into signing a plea bargain I did not even read! After four years of torture my first time in the supposed legal system!
And I never should have but there were factors that I found my husband was right and that was he told me I was too Naive and too Trusting!! He was right and he died just before I had an accident which up until then I had a clean record.
Imagine the shame that comes with being beaten up by the legal system and my lawyer knew that I was damaged!!  And innocent! And he told me someone was going to get something by making me guilty and I was told it was the proscecutor
But my lawyer got an award for Best defense lawyer though he broke his oath and he dragged me through four years of  court with false hope before turning on me and treating me like I was crazy or guilty!! Both!  And it turned out just as he told me in the beginning that two people who had lied the day before had got away with it. So they planned to scapegoat me to get respect or more back!!
I don't see how anyone could lie over such a serious thing unfortunately I had never been in shock and I had already been let go by first police on scene of this fatal accident I was in.
I was too moral to lie and had no reason too.
But five hours later and not knowing my rights I
Had been bullied by a state cop and finally came time to answer questions so I could go home!
Problem there. I planned to tell the truth as it was my moral duty but I was in shock which I had never been in my life. And I had nothing to hide.
But shockingly I could not answer one question correctly!!! And I falsely incriminated myself on every answer I tried to give and that was all that was needed!  The cop who let me go looked up and I know he thought something is wrong with her!
No one would say what I said!
Anyway he had his accusation and demoted the cop who let me go and all that cooperation still believing my blood he asked for and I gave freely knowing it would vindicate me. Seven months later not the four weeks I was told. Had spent lying on a couch wishing to die! But never hired a lawyer. For my blood was going to vindicate me.
I was wrong!!!!
Yet a specialist I payed for told my lawyer that she is telling the truth!!! It is right where it should be.
It was my legal medication I was prescribed before my husband died and after!  And I was54 years old and did not even know I was addicted to them until after the accident!! I had never ran out before until then.
Plus their were witnesses that had went to police to tell them how they each were almost hit by the guy and he was on a dirt bike and driving like a maniac!!! Bunny hopping? Too.
I am sixty years old now and six years later with lost license to drive for three years and recovered only a few months. Also a felon and I had never had an accident. Had a perfect record. It was sickening that they told a fictitious story of how it happened cause the police shows no picture of the evidence showing a twenty foot skid mark
Which even I thought was wrong somehow.
But the cop who said after looking over scene
Said "" it was clearly an accident "" you are going home. He certainly knew that proved he was flying
At high speed and could not avoid it. Yet it was also told he had plenty of time to do just that!!
Also from investigating but in the end I went from three years of false hope cause prosecutors could not find evidence against me and last year my lawyer as I said above treated me like I was guilty as a prosecutor would and or crazy! My point is
That I know and always knew I could not avioid it cause I was extremely safe only out that day by chance as AAA talked me into driving my husbands car that day to save his tires but in the middle of a nasty probate though not lawful they requested I did not drive his car till it was over. And their cruelty and abandonment of me was
Unconsciouable cause they were billionaires
And I was nothing when my husband died but the trash they left here. My point is I was so careful cause not only was I charging his battery but I was deeply afraid if I had even got a fender bender that they would sue me!!!  And I can only think that it was his unfamiliar car and perhaps it had a blind spot so I had been not that careful in my life! But people who saw it saw he was speeding. Nothing about him was ever mentioned
And the picture from police the evidence was gone which I was not shown until right before coerced to sign a guilty plea I had never read.
Just an hour before and was told to say yes or no
And I said so you want me to lie to the judge?
He said yes and if you don't you might wind up in prison or not get your unsupervised probation.
Even the judge that day offered time served but my lawyer shurnk in his chair and said nothing!
But what I did not know was he had put no appeal
In that and so he did not ever have to send me the files on my case and refused to help me get my husbands new car out of four years impoundment so I lost it!
I lost both cases obviously and I was not guilty of either and was married for 25 years!  That is the
Crumb of all I went through and I had never  a chance. And for the record they did the same to my sister in law. But I wanted to stick with that
Horrible case. Cause I was innocent and I did not know my rights. And I was in shock and I had never been in shock!!  But the case was filled with lies and corruption and his best friend had just took the job three months before the coerced
Plea bargain was given as my only option.
Same lawyer who had told my family member that they had tortured this poor woman for three years!
Well he tortured me the forth!!
Then he was rewarded that best defense lawyer right after my case.
But the corruption was in the no appeal added so I could not see all the things that I had paid for and the talks I payed for cause a person of low character weaselled his way here as my care taker and my lawyer never talked with me only him.
I never had client privacy and that person while I was in a hospital bought himself a new truck and travel live in trailer and  took 200 K out of my bank account with a false forged POA and left when I got out and stuck a knife into my computer so as to hide his talks with my lawyer.
All true story except made as small as possible cause what is important here is that I was sadly easily taken advantage of because of my condition for you never think that you will be in a accident that you at least could not even try to avoid  it but I never saw him coming and I did not know what happened cause there was no machanical that hit me. It was a person!
And I could not live with that! Innocent I was certain but still a man died was all I knew at that time!
Not all I learned after it.
The only thing we had in common was I had never drove my husbands car and he had never drove a bike!!!
Yet I have learned a lot about how that happens
And all of them were speeding is the reason for cars to not see a person is that they most all are speeding. And reckless as I found out he was.
And I was anything but not extremely careful.
I remember telling the first policeman that I learned one thing that day I never believed.
That no matter how careful you know you are that an accident could still happen.
So after I was reflexive on all things that did not make sense. I wound up for my sanity signing a guilty plea I never even read. And I as I said have just begun to recover from  the most horrible thing that can happen to a person!  And no better I feel it is my duty to make certain that no one else makes the same mistakes I did. I really fought over some differences but very few. I am ashamed to write this. But I never was guilty.  I was supposedly scapegoated from the beginning as that was what I was told and that it had nothing to do with the truth or justice!  Absolutely what my lawyer said after he supposedly found out that two people the day before lied.'same fatality! I could not lie so I found out the hard way I could not tell the truth. After five hours of repeated tests and by that compassionless State Cop. Tests I passed only by a miracle cause two weeks later had to go to emergency room and there was no way I should have been capable of walking that foot in front of foot walk.
I had severe whiplash in my neck and back and my shoulder was damaged and hurt ever since and my hair was filled with glass!
I had no idea I was hurt. My only thought was that poor man though that first cop said he was speeding pretty fast! From evidence. Which was why he let me go.

Perhaps I'm mistaken, but we live in times of supreme irony and misrepresentation.... He's not some commie spy, he exposed information, carefully, about our own GUV's shocking misrepresentations...

Perhaps it is because I immersed myself in an isolated environment with laptop with headphones that I found the slow pacing and long silences to be so tense. The words left unsaid often seemed more sinister than those articulated. And despite Snowden wanting to come forward, I could really begin to feel his terror as the comfort of his anonymity and in-charge interviews gave way to the encroaching ""oh crap"" moments as he began preparing for the next steps.

The brief scene of him staring out the hotel window was chilling in its simplicity. It reminded me of films where prisoners of war are dragged outside to the firing squad and the prisoner looks up at the sky, knowing it will be the last time. Ever. When the Chinese human rights lawyer said they didn't have a car, and Snowden made eye contact with the filmmaker, I could almost feel his stomach plummet. I enjoy horror movies, but this quiet documentary really disturbed me.",1482969600,7,1178,4.713592233009709

7007458,4,B00TGF9GGO,"Slow. Interesting because you see footage of Snowden and the reporters as they plan to release the documents, mixed with news footage of the story breaking. He was a kid living some type of tame spy thriller. It's kinda pointless, but good to see a documentary about it.

What is odd is that I got an email asking me to review this. I did not buy this documentary and do not often get requests to review movies I have not bought and only watched on prime. Creepy the NSA and amazon are monitoring people who view this documentary. Do they have nothing better to do? Can't defend our country from foreign hacking or gather helpful intelligence, but have time to waste on this.

I get sick of privacy invasion. It's uncomfortable but wouldn't be so bad if the people invading privacy did something useful and helpful with the information. The people in the documentary say that surveillance suppresses thinking, it also suppresses reporting of observations. And the people in charge often do not think and are not in a position to make useful observations or to make sense of what is going on. And because they don't think, more data is more data to be read wrong.",1482883200,,1162,4.608695652173913

7007500,5,B00TGF9GGO,"From the moment all of this began it has made me uncomfortable.  On the one hand, someone has dared to attack us in our castle and this is war.  Usually our enemies are easy to identify - this is where we live; this is where they live.  But this enemy does not engage our military, they engage us at our weakest link - our freedoms.  Freedom is a double edged sword it gives us the boldness to create and the boldness to express ourselves without fear of reprisals because we think differently than our government would like us to do.  And make no mistake they have used that against us.
Freedom to speak our minds has been under attack like never before in the open if you display a belief that is not popular with crowds on one side or the other you are attacked.  But always before you knew they could only go so far because the great equalizer was our constitution.  What Snowden did, took a lot of courage and if you think he has benefitted from the results look at his face at the end and the dark circles of his eyes.  He is a hunted man and it's not the KGB it is us.  Whether the government was right in what they did or wrong in no circumstances did they have the right to not tell us.  Journalist like to say ""the people have a right to know"" and we do.  We did not give the government permission to take away our right to know.
Another disturbing aspect that seems to be missed is the brutal truth that Snowden understands.  The problem with granting the government this power is getting the power back is nearly impossible and if  your fine with Bush having that power you weren't fine with Obama having that power.  Will anyone feel fine about what's next?

This is a valuable, unvarnished record of Snowden's motives for exposing the depth and breadth of NSA data surveillance as Snowden assumes full responsibility for his actions and explains why mass surveillance of Americans is an egregious violation of every citizen's first amendment rights to free speech. The secrecy under which the documentary was made, all taking place in two hotel rooms, captures in-depth Snowden's personality and character and gives us a rare and  intimate look into the thought processes of this fascinating figure.",1482624000,,917,5.4125874125874125

Yes, in my experience many documentaries are extreme left propaganda, and of course opinions expressed in this film are on his side as its a documentary about him and what he did, but its subtle and well-done.

We live in a surveillance state, and Ed Snowden is a HERO for wanting people to know the extent of this.  He had to leave his country because Obama will NOT pardon him (Presidenet Obama== please pardon this man!).  We have no freedom, and yet people always say, ""I have nothing to hide.""  Uh, that is not the point.  If you want to maintain free speech, you want freedom, not spying.
Your computer, your smart TV, your phone all spy on you.  It is endless.

So... kudos for this documentary.  Very important topic.

It was well-done, although I found the ""music"" (scary snake music), annoying.

BTW, President obama apparently broadened the scope of the spying.  So Trump is going to have all that at his fingertips....  hope I don't give anyone nightmares with that thought.",1482364800,2,906,4.559006211180124

It's as if there is a Shadow Government that functions parallel to the elected government, and answers to no one. I recall the news coverage at the time, but it was too bland to excite me in any way. It did not make me think. It did not impress upon me that total information control is the loss of freedom. Not so with Laura Poitras' well made documentary.

I hope it allows people who do not get involved to ask more questions about what this means to them. There is a small bit of bias. No one ever outlined what injury or harm was done by this surveillance. If the information is kept secret and no actions are taken against a person in any way what is the intrusion? Could it be that the expectation of privacy that is promoted about the internet is in itself a con? Ask questions, there is the way you want it to be and the way that it is.

Citizenfour backed up a lot of info in Snowden which was nice. Dude is a hero.  Our .Gov agencies have over-reached and overstepped ALOT.  Snowden hasn't been the first whistleblower and I hope that he won't be the last.  Checks and balances can be made efficiently so as to not feel the need to say that they get in the way of justice.  I agree that ISIS and their ilk need to be eradicated from the earth but thru due process.  I am not saying bring them to court. I am saying speed up the judicial process so you can act on valuable Intel before it is worthless.  I want them all to eat hellfires.  My biggest issue and the reason his sacrifice was so important is the same .gov agencies using these assets to fight the good fight were using those same programs to spy on the American people.

Snowden back on US soil as the hero that he is will be a good day indeed. Nelson Mandela. A youngster when asked to comment on Mandela stated that he was a black man who went to jail and then went on to be president. Seriously. This was her interpretation of the events in Mandela's life. Someday I am hopeful that the same simplicity is recited concerning the complexity of Snowden's choices. I think we are not being very intelligent to leave this principled individual who is intelligent and has something to offer any society in a nation that does not have US interests at heart. I believe that Snowden does have US interest at heart.

7007733,3,B00TGF9GGO,"Ok; we get it. Nothing is secret and if Uncle Barry wants to find out about us he can. At times a chilling reminder about unchecked power running roughshod over the Constitution.

The movie gets bogged down with too much clandestine BS near the end. Do we really need to see a ten minute ""interview"" where Greenwald and Snowden trade scribbled notes which nobody but they can see and watch the reaction shots of Snowden when he reads these notes?

It almost felt like watching a bad reality show near the end.

That and the omnipresent mood music in the background made this a little more tedious than it needed to be. This could have been a short instead of a full length movie.

The topic and subjects covered are very important and for that I am thankful for the movie. As a documentary it leaves something to be desired.",1481673600,,824,4.473333333333334

7007741,5,B00TGF9GGO,"A must see for any citizen who cares at all about ""freedom."" the film shows how utterly false and misleading the news stories and coverage are.

7007743,5,B00TGF9GGO,"An almost unbelievable story of an American patriot who chooses to fight subversives inside the Federal government to help preserved the personal liberties of American citizens.  The lead character is played by the protagonist himself - Eric Snowden.  Since in real life Snowden is confined to a single hotel in Moscow, scenes for the movie's action and dialog are very limited.  Instead of limiting the value of the story, however, the limitations imposed by the US government's attempts to arrest and silence Snowden simply add credibility and serve to amplify the story's message.  The movie's dialog and photography are of decent quality, although generally unremarkable given the severe production constraints.  The impression I came away with was like witnessing a surreal scene out of George Orwell's 1984.  Actions portrayed in the movie simply cannot happen here because this is America, the land of free and home of the brave.  In the end, it becomes very sobering since everyone in the audience already knows of the true story.  The filling in of all the details surrounding Snowden's story is what makes the movie so captivating and powerful.  Anyone who is interested in liberty, power politics, American history, and social change should consider this movie as a ""must see"".  For all the rest, it's a rare cinematic triumph of a voice crying out in the wilderness in a desperate attempt to defend human freedom and ward off oppression.",1481587200,3,1449,5.101694915254237

Despite th Government's best efforts to make Snowden a traitor, after watching this, you can't help but judge him as a truth teller.  It cost him much to expose the Government, and you can see how they tried to derail him personally and through his fiance and friends and family.  We were also led to believe Snowden was some kind of low level, know-little button pusher.  He was far from that.
The movie does not have car chases or stuff blowing up.  It is a story told to reporters on film.  It is more educational than entertaining, and more than a bit frightening.",1481500800,,707,4.4

It presents his side, the side of a citizen, versus the government and their take. Really makes me think more about how everyone has their reasons for their actions, no matter the backlash they may receive.

This is about an hour and a half into the film;  tedium explodes on the silver screen. She includes a clip of Glenn Greenwalds speech in Portuguese in Brazil and his emotional airport meeting with his partner. Poitras offers no images of what surely was Snowdens tension-filled flight from HK to Moscow or his lengthy ""holiday"" at Sheremetyevo Airport.

Now, we have someone coming into the presidency with no ethics at all, and it is painful to think what that person could do with this type of surveillance. It's interesting that the first thing the pres-elect is trying to do is to intimidate the press, the most powerful people in the news industry whom he called together to harangue about how they cover news about him. Isn't that what despots do? They prevent free speech, free press, and any challenges to their power.

As a progressive, I can understand his misgivings about the scope and techniques of our intelligence agencies, but to reveal that information in the manner in which he did betrayed our nation and the tens of thousands of individuals who sacrifice every day on behalf of protecting our homeland. He accomplished nothing beyond ensuring that security protocols for these intelligence agencies are more stringent.

We are supposed to be the shining example of a democracy.  Not a joke. Snowdon's  whistleblowing was not illegal. it is every citizen's duty to report illegal activities regardless of who the perpetrator is, even a clandestine organization.  It was his duty as a citizen to disclose it And if not for him, we would still be in the dark  or continue to be nave of how vulnerable and unsupported we are by our own government. How much they respect individual  rights to privacy. Are we all just life support for some other entity that in fact has no relationship to the ideals were  told were inalienable since we were born. Was it all a lie? is there someone else using our country's faith and reliance on the protections of the Constitution against  us? Snowden pulled back the curtain on a threat to all of us.

He is no hero. And I believe LITTLE of what he said, beyond the smear of the ""metadata"" which isn't a topic that 99% of the people even understand. The point is, when the NSA or the FBI find a terrorist after the fact, without the  ability to find out who he communicated with is tying the hands of the people that are trying to protect us. The American public has been paranoid about what the government does, and is largely unaware of how dedicated the people who work so hard to keep us safe need these tools.
I thought it was a propaganda piece all the way, with the efforts to convince the viewer of the sinister nature of the government all through the movie.

The interviews with Snowden were laced with crazy spy-scare fright, and I didn't buy a bit of it. If he REALLY wanted to object to what was going on, he could have gone through channels and NOT damaged the agency.",1479600000,6,1102,4.193396226415095

7008138,5,B00TGF9GGO,"I was so disappointed in Obama's press release in the wake of revelations of just how much worse the abuses had become under his administration. Obama seems to expect us to belive that the furtherance, extension and expansion of domestic surveillance taking place WITH HIS EXPLICIT APPROVAL should have been tolerated for an indeterminant period of time while the extensions he signed into law himself could be ""calmly and rationally examined.""

While the talking heads pretend that Snowden's revelations have done irreparable damage to US intelligence, the only damage that has in fact ccurred is the exposure of a continuing criminal enterprise, and treasonous betrayals by our government of our most sacred ideals by those we elected.

7008170,5,B00TGF9GGO,"As an assignment for one of her university classes my daughter was required to research Edward Snowden. We ended up watching this documentary and Snowden's interview with Brian Williams, reading some books of critical essays, collections of various articles written before and after his information release, etc.  This documentary was a wake-up call and made our family ashamed that we hadn't known who Edward Snowden was before the assignment. (We had thought he was involved with WikiLeaks.)

Our family all came to the conclusion that Snowden is a patriot / whistle blower. If you haven't researched Snowden, you should. He was protecting our freedoms and is now stuck in Russia because the US revoked his passport. His efforts caused Congress shut down a program doing bulk collection of information on US citizens (and others); a federal judge said the NSA phone surveillance program is unconstitutional, etc. Well, it's a long list...

The right to privacy in our own homes and communications; the right to face accusers and provide evidence in a trial.

Those - including government workers, military personnel and journalists - who have helped provide evidence that the United States is routinely ignoring these rights and is routinely murdering/torturing US and other citizens,  have been ruthlessly hunted down, imprisoned, forced to flee the country, tortured by lengthy solitary confinement leading to repeated suicide attempts, and, in the case of journalists, threatened with
imprisonment.

""Citizen Four,"" a remarkable documentary by filmmakers/journalists who insist on defying governmental intimidation, is a splendid account of the emergence of a modest young man who had gradually realized through his work the massive extent of our government's intrusion into our private lives and who felt he could not live with himself unless he helped expose these practices to the rest of us.",1479168000,,1209,5.375661375661376

This is most exciting part of the film. We could barely keep ourselves awake during the movie, and shut it off half way through because there was no point continuing.

7008320,5,B00TGF9GGO,"Not a conventional spy thriller for those that like such things, but rather a story about a clear-thinking, highly intelligent young man with very constitutionally-oriented ideas about what was and wasn't permissible by the government. As an employee of NSA in Hawaii (?), he found that the U.S. was intercepting virtually all information that traveled over the internet, cell phone circuits, and anywhere else that was accessible. This was in violation of established law that closely governed the circumstances under which the government could engage in such behavior. The story is about who he contacted to bring about the worldwide notification that this surveillance was active and that data was being collected from people in virtually all countries and at all levels of society and government.

A great story of moral clarity and bravery, brought to you courtesy of Laura Poitras and Glen Greenwald, the photojournalist and reporter responsible for the dissemination of the information and the creation of this film. In another story of another time, Bob Dylan advised ""Bury the rag deep in your face, for now is the time for your tears"". This time, however, it's a time for tears AND for jubilation. Tears at the way our constitution is being abused, and jubilation that some are brave enough to fight back despite the risk. Bravo, bravo,bravo!

7008417,5,B00TGF9GGO,"As a documentary this was an excellent watch. It is strictly documentary - no acting involved. We are being watched, and monitored all the time in every possible way by our government. While I agree that ""whistleblowers"" should be protected by law, and I agree that the government does not have a right to every detail of our personal life - there were other questions this documentary caused me to ask myself. It's hard not to wonder if the information about the drones strikes being flown from a German airforce base (contained in this film) might have been a catalyst for the terror attacks in Germany. That is just one thought that occurred to me while watching this. Terrorism is of course the flip side of this documentary, and the reason we all so willingly seem ready to give over our privacy.

I had many other thoughts while watching this, and I suspect you will too. I think we all now expect that we are being monitored, listened to, and watched by our government all the time. As was mentioned in this documentary ""we actually joke about it."" Snowden really becomes incidental in this documentary (as is what he wanted based on what he says here). It does become clear that Snowden had a real crisis of conscience that led him to divulge these documents. It also seems pretty clear that the journalists involved tried very hard to protect government secrets that could have caused harm to U.S. agents, military etc.

This is absolutely worth your time to watch, and it is really incredible to see Snowden grappling, (in real time) with the decision he has made - he is only 29 here. Whether Snowden will ever be allowed a fair trial, (or trial at all) in the U.S. will be answered in history books. The politics of the matter will never allow any president to let Snowden off the hook. No political party wants to be the one on watch when, and if there is ever a terror event in the U.S., so my guess is Snowden will never be allowed to leave Russia - at least to come back to the U.S. Neither political party wants to look ""soft on terror."" Just look at the political hay that has been made on this subject in this election cycle.

7008437,5,B00TGF9GGO,"Not since Daniel Ellsberg broke the extreme illegality of Americas involvement in the Vietnam War with his release of the Pentagon Papers had any government contractor dared to defy their employers and made public huge government dissembling that affected the lives of every man, woman, and child living inside the boundaries of the United States.  Just before the end of 2012, an individual who identified himself in e-mails as Citizenfour revealed to documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras all-too-convincing evidence that the U.S. intelligence complex, including the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, and most of the major communications conglomerates, were engaged in mass surveillance against the nations own people in the years and decades following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.  As it turned out, Citizenfour would be identified as Edward Joseph Snowden.  In June 2013, Poitras and noted journalist Glenn Greenwald interviewed Snowden at a high-rise hotel in Hong Kong in which he revealed the first huge batch of what he knew.  The end result was Snowden becoming one of the most wanted men in history.  What also resulted was the Oscar-winning, and disturbing, 2014 documentary CITIZENFOUR.

Poitras had already done two documentaries (2006s MY COUNTRY, MY COUNTRY; 2010s THE OATH) that touched on post-9/11 America; and CITIZENFOUR expands on those two films to focus on what the deaths of nearly 3,000 people on that dark late summer day in 2001 unleashed in the bowels of the intelligence community inside the United States.  Poitras, along with Greenwald and MacAskill (the last two of whom worked at the British newspaper The Guardian) went and interviewed Snowden in Hong Kong; and a lot of that interview involves Snowdens chillingly detailed information about how every branch of the intelligence community, and their contractors, including the one (Booz Allen) that Snowden had worked for, used its expertise to monitor the activities of everyone at practically every second of their public and online lives during the day.  The revelations that Snowden allowed Greenwald to make public turned out to be every bit as explosive in the media and to the American public as advertised, and then some.  Not surprisingly, the kind of paranoia that developed among the three of them in that tenth floor Hong Kong hotel room was extraordinary.  And once the first revelations were made public, Snowden was charged with three crimes, two under the U.S. Espionage Act of 1917, basically putting him in the crosshairs of the entire United States government, which was shamed by his revelations, and making him a target for the ultimate charge of Treason.

The revelations that Snowden makes to Poitras, Greenwald, and MacAskill (which director Oliver Stone dramatized in his 2016 film SNOWDEN) in his Hong Kong hotel room, along with the e-mail messages he delivers to Poitras and Greenwald while on the run, reveal a great deal about the things the United States government has been doing, to a great degree because of electronic encryption software that was of Snowdens own design, to track the movements of every American citizen possible.  It is likely that Snowden first identified himself to Poitras as Citizenfour because of his concerns about how the massive bulk-collection program being carried out violates the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution.  This amendment guarantees that the government cannot search and seize a person or his property without proper cause; but the Patriot Act, signed into law just after 9/11 by then-president George W. Bush after being passed by a Congress that read not one single page of it, basically superseded it (with the acquiescence of a fearful American public) in the name of National Security.  In essence, both CITIZENFOUR, and, two years later, SNOWDEN seem not only to indict Bush and, later, Obama in this whole scandal, but to a fair extent We The People in the bargain.

The years following the 9/11 attacks saw a huge explosion in the number of feature-length documentaries being made, including Michael Moores infamous FAHRENHEIT 9/11, and more sober ones like Eugene Jareckis WHY WE FIGHT, and Charles Fergusons NO END IN SIGHT.  CITIZENFOUR, whose Oscar win in 2014 was richly justified, should be considered another essential addition to the number of films which speak the truth against government power and overreach.  It is as darkly spooky as any fictional high-tech espionage thriller, and thanks to its being about contemporary events, even more so.",1476403200,,4562,5.2445054945054945

7008457,5,B00TGF9GGO,"This film is pretty depressing.

We begin watching congressional committee testimony where one major intelligence figure after another gets up and testifies under oath to congress that the United States government is not engaged in massive indiscriminate surveillance of the the American public.

Then comes Snowden, who gives unequivocal proof of such indiscriminate surveillance to journalists. Unlike Bradley Manning who gave classified information to Wikileaks who dumped the information wholesale without regard for particular consequences, the journalists Snowden gives the information to merely report that the U.S. and British governments are in fact spying worldwide on everyone using the internet, without any real judicial oversight. Snowden does this without any expectation of personal gain, knowing that he will very likely either be imprisoned or in political exile for the rest of his life. His goal is not to undermine U.S. security, but to strengthen it.

The Supreme Court has confirmed in places like Griswold v. Connecticut and Roe v. Wade that the American people have an unenumerated right to privacy under the 9th Amendment. The 4th Amendment protects us from indiscriminate surveillance, requiring for example judicial warrants for phone taps.

Edward Snowden is in my opinion a hero for revealing evidence that our right to privacy is under profound threat. I hope that President Obama grants him a pardon for what he has done. I hope too that we the American people wake up, and demand that our intelligence community respect our rights and submit to effective judicial oversight of their activities.

Trust in government is already at a low ebb. Lack of transparency and proper oversight will only make this lack of trust worse.. A consequence we as a body politic can ill afford.",1475280000,,1808,5.329824561403509

Snowden is not the first American to face this dilemma in regard to American foreign policy. Neither was Christopher Boyce (The Falcon and the Snowman). But whilst Boyce may appear to have acted impulsively,  Snowden is cut from a different cloth. Calculating, tactical and strategic, this man has dealt what may yet turn out to be the killer blow. The pen is mightier than the sword, albeit somewhat slower to causation. The invention of the printing press took nigh on a century before its cumulative effects started to topple the once mighty Roman Catholic Churches dominance of Europe. We will have to wait to see how history plays out. But this phenomena is not a one trick pony as Wikileaks, Bradley Manning, The Panama Papers and Snowden's revelations all bear witness to.

In all likelihood, very little of what Snowden says about himself is true. Sad that so many believe his story, simply based on his say so. And now Oliver Stone had made a movie about Snowden.  It shows self-absorbed, attention seeking wanna-bes. Other reviewers have commented on the lack of detail. That is likely because Snowden stumbled across some presentation material on the activities of several three-lettered agencies, and didn't like what he saw. He has no details. He is a traitor. The access he had, not nearly what he claims, he exploited so he could get some attention.

It is inspiring how one rare and brave man can stand against such great power to do what he feels is necessary. Whether you admire him or not, you must admit, that he has sacrificed such a very great deal for his cause. He abhorred what he saw at work and saw a chance to make a difference. The life he knew is gone. Nevertheless, his current situation is the best he was hoping for.
I offer the following list of three human types to help you decide whether or not to buy this DVD.
A. You don't think much about meaning and think that the one who dies with the most toys wins.
B. You do think about having a meaning in your life and struggle to keep hope alive for yourself and others.
C. You have thought about a meaningful life and are absolutely sure it is impossible.

Type A and C: NO. Try another action movie.",1459382400,,916,4.300578034682081

7008668,5,B00TGF9GGO,"This documentary was awesome.

We owe Ed Snowden a great deal of credit for exposing gross violations to the Constitution as it relates to illicit search and the right to privacy.  Those administrators and legislators allowing this to happen and/or failing to prevent it should be sued for violating citizens' civil rights. When the violated citizens win the case, the administrators of said agencies and legislators having knowledge of the violations doing nothing to curb it should loose all their worldly assets including  their social security and retirement benefits.  They deserve to be relegated to homelessness for life as an appropriate punishment.  Those deemed guilty don't deserve a jail cell.

Thank you Mr. Snowden, Glen Greenwald, Wikileaks and all of those who helped expose this travesty of justice.  If we were serious about national security, we'd strengthen our borders.  Spying on citizens is simply an effort to control the population... not protect it.

It also described the tension when Snowden arrive in Russia with the Wiki advisor and the process where he sought amnesty and how he had hid out in the airport for 30 days. One amazing occurrence was when the U.S ordered to land a plane with the Venezuela president on board by authorizing the plane not to cross European air-space so that the plane could land and be searched [for Snowden] after leaving Russia.. something that by-passes the law for international protocol on presidential flights from global leaders which get amnesty from investigation. It illustrates how far the U.S was willing to go in this critical time.

Citizen Four provides additional background and also has more real life footage with Snowden.",1454544000,,955,5.0
7008676,3,B00TGF9GGO,"Citizenfour is a film by Laura Poitras about her own involvement and that of journalist Glenn Greenwald in bringing the information leaked by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden to the public in 2013. The films title is the name that Snowden used to sign e-mails written to Poitras, when he was still anonymous. Judging by the films trailer, poster, and title, one would get the impression that this film is about Mr. Snowden and the information he tried to make public. Actually, Citizenfour does not have a strong focus, but it has a three-act structure.

First, Poitras provides some hazy background information on the NSAs Stellar Wind surveillance program. The central part of the film, lasting about an hour, is the meeting between Snowden, Poitras, and Greenwald in Hong Kong in June 2013, during which Greenwald begins to publish articles based on Snowdens leaks. The third part concerns the journalists ongoing efforts to draw attention to the NSA surveillance programs and halfhearted attempts by various foreign bodies, including the EU parliament, to decide what their positions on mass surveillance might be.

The NSAs surveillance of American citizens, its legal status, cost, benefit, social and political ramifications, and Snowdens leaks are interesting and important subjects. I was eager to hear what Edward Snowden had to say. But Citizenfour doesnt offer much substance. Its not about the substance of the leaks, which are mentioned only in passing. Its not about Snowden, who doesnt have the opportunity to say much. Someone thought it would be a good idea to film him in a white t-shirt against a white headboard, so that he would look angelic.

Someone also thought that it would be interesting to include the fire alarm tests that punctuated the conversation at The Mira Hotel while Poitras filmed Snowden in his room, including Snowdens phone call to the desk to inquire about the noise. It goes without saying that this material is suited only to the cutting room floor. The film is more about Glenn Greenwald than Snowden, though not enough to lend it any focus or empathy. Its ironic that Snowden didn't want to make the leaks about himself, but two journalists have made a film about themselves that is ostensibly about Snowden.

Poitras message that mass surveillance stifles important political discourse- is lost or at least muddled in the films poor structure and bad editing. Snowden was nave to think that his coming forward would make a point. I question Poitras ethics in going along with this plan, when she must have known it would just wreck his life. At least Greenwald suggests the possibility of Snowden not revealing himself. That might have bought him enough time to avoid the Russian sojourn. Very strange that Citizenfour won an Academy Award, as it is thematically weak and poorly made.

Edward Snowden Quotes:
* ""Assume your adversary is capable of one trillion guesses per second.""
* ""We are building the biggest weapon for oppression in the history of mankind.""
* ""You asked why I picked you. I didn't. You did.""
* ""We all have a stake in this, this is our country and the balance of power between the citizenry and the government is becoming that of the ruling and the ruled as opposed to actually, you know, the elected and the electorate.""

7008698,5,B00TGF9GGO,"Laura Poitras 2014 film about NSA whistleblower, Edward Snowden, presents a young, smart, good-humored guy who is incredibly courageous.  He tells of his early passion about the positive potential of the internet and his growing alarm at its use by the U.S. government to spy on its own citizens with no limits or controls.  His well-planned revelations are revealed in a hotel room in Hong Kong to The Guardian journalists Glenn Greenwald and Ewan MacAskill under the watchful eye of Poitras camera.  The film also spends time with William Binney, a government intelligence analyst who turned whistleblower to protest abuses he saw taking place in the governments actions after 9/11.  As a result, Binney was raided by FBI agents who stormed into his house with guns drawn which shows the lie in the claimmade by President Obama and others in the government and mediathat everything would have been fine if Snowden had gone through proper channels to make his revelations to the American public.  We also see Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and Director of the National Security Agency (NSA) Keith Alexander both lying to Congresspresumably under oathabout the extent of the governments spying on American citizens. Poitras was placed on a secret government watch list and thereafter stopped and searched dozens of times as she tried to enter the U.S. This harassment prompted her to move to Berlin. Greenwald lives in Brazil. His partner was detained for hours in a London airport.  Snowden remains in asylum in Moscow where his partner has joined him.

7008699,2,B00TGF9GGO,"The subject matter is interesting, but as a piece of film-making this is not high quality. Visually, most of the movie is people in hotel rooms talking quietly, which is as boring as it sounds. When that fails to communicate some piece of information deemed necessary, the film-makers call on snippets of small-font white text on a black screen to do the job. I didn't learn any more about the spying programs or Snowden's motivations than I knew already, nor did the film really wrestle with the implications, beyond some cartoon-level analysis done by speakers at a conference (more riveting film-making).

Regarding surveillance this is something new that came with the technology and it is adaptation period both for Government and criminals. Maybe Government  went a bit too far ahead of curve but in my opinion it was necessary to prevent some scenarios that could cost us lives. We have to learn from natural systems like for example our immune system. That system is pretty deep into molecular level of information flow intercepting vast quantities of data and once when recognize malicious pattern it goes backwards and spreads information and attacks virus or bacteria an heals system.

7008753,5,B00TGF9GGO,"Theres no real reason to rate this film R, except for a handful of f-words dropped with genuine feeling.  There is no nudity or semi-nudity, and no violence on screen.  Most of you have probably heard of the film and know that its about Edward Snowden and his revelations of US spying nationally and internationally.  Its also just as much some self-promotion by the journalists who assisted him in breaking the story, including Laura Poitras (who gets credits as the lead producer, director and lead cinematographer) and Glenn Greenwald, who features prominently in the film but isn't even listed in the dust jacket credits (though to be fair, his name does appear in the 1-paragraph summary).

This may seem like very old news now, since the story first broke in 2013 and the film won an academy award in 2014 for best documentary.  However, having just watched it (and not yet even touched a second disc which is all bonus features) Id say its the most important film Ive watched this year.  Old though the news may seem, when you hear it laid out step by step (and not everything is laid out, that is also made clear) it still has the power to impress and amaze.

Yes, there are two controversies surrounding the documentary: one between those who view Snowden as a hero or as a traitor; the other a more technical controversy about the style and pacing of the film, which at 113 minutes is longer than the average documentary.  I really think the latter is almost beside the point, and the former is still not quite on point.  The real controversy is about government transparency versus secrecy.  When it comes right down to it, almost everyone agrees that some aspects of government functioning must stay secret in order to catch criminals, not allow the country to be taken advantage of by less scrupulous adversaries and so on.  Almost everyone also recognizes on some level that the more secrets a government keeps, the more it assumes the nature of a police-state and can easily slip right into a totalitarian state.

Besides hearing Snowden speaking for himself, several other experts also speak about the problem and some state quite eloquently how easily this kind of vast, secret power can be abused.  As one put it, What we used to speak of as our liberty and our freedom has now been rephrased as a discussion about our privacybut how much freedom of speech do you really have, if someone is monitoring your every communication and action?

7008761,5,B00TGF9GGO,"No matter what you think of Ed Snowden, every American should view this film. It is so powerful in its simplicity that it changed the course of national security. Laura Poitras the director of the film was also present and part of the group to interview Snowden. At the outset you know that Ed Snowden, Laura Poitras, Glenn Greenwald and Ewen MacAskil, won the Pulitzer Prize for their reporting. This film also won an Oscar for Best Documentary.

Laura Poitras was contacted by Ed Snowden because of who she was. She had made several documentaries, and had been stopped so many times by National Security she was on a secret governmental watch list. She moved to Berlin, Germany to get away from the constant surveillance. Ed Snowden had sent many emails to her that revealed his intent. He asked Laura and Glenn Greenwald to meet him in Hong Kong. It was here that we meet Snowden, and see for ourselves what havoc has been wrought by our government. The blatant lies by our government officials are exposed for all to see. What we have is an Orwellian attempt to prevent our liberty.

In the Hong Kong meetings that take up a good hour of the film we see undramatic testimony but so very absorbing. A group of individuals are discussing the revelations from Snowden, Poitras, Greenwald and Snowden were and are practicing the transparency we want from our government, but will unlikely ever occur. Think what you want about Snowden, but I believe him. He was calm and poised and knew what his future might hold. He seems sane and a good guy, believing in what he was doing. Poitras for her part is not seen in the film, we hear her voice, but never see her. Glenn Greenwald has been a journalist I have followed since his Salon.com days. I believe in him. President Obama comes across several times as misinformed. Thinking that a man who has been charged with treason for publishing secret material would ever stand a chance at a fair trial is laughable.

Please view this film whatever your thoughts are. You need to know the facts. This is a film fir the ages.

7008778,5,B00TGF9GGO,"Citizenfour is a real-life thriller that unfolds in gripping minute-by-minute fashion. Director Laura Poitras and journalist Glenn Greenwald met with whistleblower Edward Snowden in a Hong Kong hotel room as he handed over classified documents that provided evidence of mass, indiscriminate, illegal invasions of privacy by our National Security Agency.

The documentary explores the dangers of unchecked governmental surveillance, revealing how our phones, e-mails, credit cards, and web browsers are not as secure and private as we thought. It reveals how government agencies such as the CIA, FBI, and NSA go through all of our records, looking for certain buzzwords. If they're found in your communications, you get earmarked for scrutiny and possible harassment.

When Poitras and Greenwald first meet with Snowden, they don't even know his name. After Greenwald publishes the story of Snowdens exile with help from media outlets in Great Britain and Brazil, other reporters join the U.S. government in looking for him. Poitras camera captures his evasions and disguises as Snowden searches for a country that will grant him asylum. The documentary plays like a Hollywood spy film as it exposes the lengths to which the United States will go to capture Snowden and put him on trial for treason.

In a post-9/11 world, some may argue that the collection of data on a mass scale is necessary to find and stop potential terrorist threats to American citizens. Others may maintain that government must not circumvent the Constitution. Poitras leaves conclusions to the viewer. The film itself   a testament to First Amendment rights  is the 2014 Academy Award winner for Best Documentary Feature.

Bonus extras on the Blu-ray release include deleted scenes; New York Times talk with Laura Poitras, Glenn Greenwald, Edward Snowden and David Carr; Film Society of Lincoln Center Q & A with Laura Poitras; and The Program, a New York Times Op-Doc by Laura Poitras.",1440374400,10,1961,5.266025641025641

7008788,1,B00TGF9GGO,"The film quality itself was disappointing - it was equivalent to a home movie, nothing like the trailer made you expect it to be.  There were places throughout the film that at times told the story of the director's troubles with previous films, being detained at the airport, etc.  It was clear the director wanted us to empathize with the director's own experiences and perceptions of ""big government"".  That message, however, didn't jive with the film's portrayal of Snowden.  I wasn't sure if I was supposed to empathize with Snowden -- the director portrayed him as a pathetic 23-year old narcissist who had no clear-cut goal or expected outcome in mind when he ran away to two different countries that both embrace internet censorship and monitoring of their own citizens - the very values he acts like he is against in this film.",1438473600,6,836,4.825174825174825

Wikileaks'treatment of my fellow native Icelanders does serve as a warning and as a good example of what happens when people trust people with no real interest in their interests to assert that they are actually representing their interests. When the fact is that our personal interests are our thing and we ought to stay clear of Wikileaks. I stay as far away from Wikileaks as possible and consequently Wikileaks isn't after me. But it's after anybody else who dares to step in their way and speak freely from their own mind in an age when Wikileaks spies on anyone who visits their dying internet bulls*** threads. We don't therefore need Wikileaks and never did. Ergo sum. We therefore never needed any of this Assange, Manning, Snowden crap. We've been fed with such crap of imaginary heroes for centuries and if we want to find another imaginary hero to look up to we can buy another comic or illustrate one ourselves. Wikileaks thus does not need to illustrate comics for us. Much as I love comics.

Snowden's data dump was deeper that I ever thought, and he himself was a more sophisticated player than I understood.  The filmmaker, Laura Poitras, is brilliant, but her decision to have a female narrator as the voiceover of Snowden was an unusual and unsuccessful choice.  I found it distracting and the female narrator seemed to be reading a script without understanding what she was saying.  I hated that part of the film.  It took quite awhile, too long, to get to Snowden himself.  Too much was spent on the Glen Greenwald media tour, too.  Greenwald was too much an actor in this film, and I found that distracting.  It ends on an odd, and to my mind scary note.

7008816,5,B00TGF9GGO,"Well done and scary.  Our civil liberties ARE vanishing and nobody seems to care except a small minority of people.  If Ed Snowden were my son, I would be very proud of him. I am glad there are whistle blowers to shed light on government abuse.  It takes courage, deep conviction, a morality to do what they do.  It is clear Mr. Snowden is not a nut or disgruntled as the government always portrays those who show its duplicity and abuse of power.  I am also glad there are journalist still worthy of that title.  It was a little bit too much focused on Mr. Greenwald and the governments persecution (and I agree that that is the correct term) of him because he comes across a little whiny.  But then again, if I had been through what he had, I would be more than a little whiny, scared and pissed off.  What this along with Will Smith in Enemy of the State and you will really start to be paranoid.  Look at the actual documents that Snowden exposed and you will be terrified. If you watch John Oliver you will be disgusted.  Think what would have happened if the Nazi's had the capabilities that our government now has.  Not one non-arryan or resistance fighter would have lived more than a week.

7008820,5,B00TGF9GGO,"I chanced to watch this film by accident recently. In the film, though the presentation of the momentous facts about mass surveillance across the world by Western democracies is rather matter-of-fact, and devoid of drama, it still left me with the chilling reality of how we have transitioned from a liberal nation into a  Stasi-like state in the brief interval of twenty years. I had been aware of the details narrated in the film as to how Edward Snowden came to inform the world about the deep invasion of our privacy by Western governments. Still, it was  exciting to watch the same events unfold in the film as they actually happened in real time. Whether one thinks Snowden is a traitor or a hero or is undecided about him, this is a must-see film for everyone because it is important to know what has been happening in advanced democratic nations on the question of privacy and personal freedom. Having seen the film, I feel that we cannot trust our corporate media any longer to inform us without its bias towards the government's point-of-view on so-called security matters. Nor could we trust our Congressmen and senators because the film shows them lying under oath on the issue of mass surveillance.

The film's title is 'Citizen Four' because that was the id under which Edward Snowden first started getting into contact with Laura Poitras, the director and producer of the film, and journalist Glenn Greenwald. The contact was made through open-source encrypted channels and anonymous emails so that they can vet each other's bona-fides and gain confidence with each other. Once this was done, they decide to meet in a hotel room in Hong Kong so that Snowden can transfer the disks containing all the explosive material on mass surveillance he has downloaded from the NSA. Much of the details revealed in the film are now public knowledge. We now know that big telecom companies like AT&T and Verizon opened up millions of customers' call records for the NSA; that the notorious PRISM program snaps up all e-mails, text messages, phone calls, and chats of foreigners and US citizens;that the FBI tapped into the customer data held by internet firms like Google, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft etc ; that there are programs called Stellar Wind, XKeyscore and Tempora which carry out mining of voluminous metadata and other stealth functions; that there is an intelligence alliance called 'Five Eyes' consisting of the UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand along with the US which access all our everyday communications, not just meta data but content as well, contrary to what  President Obama would have us believe. Snowden reveals that UK's GCHQ has the most invasive surveillance of its citizens among the 'Five Eyes' countries. He says that NSA officials would love to do the same on US citizens but are afraid of the law that clearly prevents them.

There are eerie moments in the documentary when we see alarm bells ringing in Snowden's hotel room for a fire alarm drill. Suspecting that they were always under watch, Snowden instinctively disconnects his phone in case it is being used as a listening device. While signing on to his online account, Snowden puts on a shroud over his head so that no hidden camera could film him. It might look like deep paranoia, but in my view, it is such a sad indictment of the state of freedom and liberty of Americans that a US citizen like Snowden had to resort to such behavior to uphold what he believes to be his constitutional right. It seems no different from the persecution that Soviet dissidents went through in the USSR during the cold war years.

The government apparatus will have a hard time convincing anyone who has seen the film in their claims that Edward Snowden is a misguided youth or a traitor or driven by personal glory or vendetta. He comes off as a genuine, geeky, soft-spoken technologist and quite smart and committed to his cause of protection of our private lives. The film shows that it is not just Snowden alone in the NSA who was alienated by what was happening on the issue of mass surveillance. William Binney, the mathematician in NSA who was the creator of the program Stellar Wind, says that he also quit the NSA for similar reasons of conscience like Snowden because the NSA turned his program inward to spy on ordinary Americans as well. There is the official barb against Snowden about the irony of him being in a an authoritarian state like Russia while talking about high-sounding values like freedom and surveillance. The fact is that he is in Russia not because he chose to be there but because the US govt invalidated his passport while he was in Moscow airport and as a result, he is not able to leave anywhere now.

Still, I'm glad I made the effort. I remember in 1984 people smirking and laughing about the fact that George Orwell had perhaps been ""premature"" in projecting his bleak, paranoid vision of the future into a time only a few decades removed from his own. Sadly, this film makes it very clear that the laugh (if there is one) is on them. It was ""1984."" And it still is.",1434672000,5,775,4.656934306569343
7008823,4,B00TGF9GGO,"I notice that there are many reviewers here who love this documentary and some others who found it dull as dishwater. That is why this is a hard documentary to review because I can see both points of view. The people who love it are those who are awed by Snowdon's blowing the whistle on the government for ""searching"" American citizens electronically without a warrant. The government was given the power under the Patriot Act to do this to non US citizens in post 9/11. The government abused this power and Snowden blew the whistle on it. He worked for the intelligence agencies and was considered one of the best on computers himself. This is pretty heady stuff and all true. The US government says it wants to try Snowden for espionage but I don't believe it. He reported crimes being committed by his fellow employees against ordinary Americans. He could name so many names of these government criminals that the government would have to try hundreds more. So, yes, fascinating subject matter and the best is when Snowden himself is on camera.

Now for those of you who might hate it. We have gotten used to documentaries which are just as cleverly filmed as fictional movies. The likes of  Ken Burns, Errol Morris and others have really invigorated this genre. However, this film is shot the old way of filming a documentary where there is mostly talking, writing via computer, and sitting in hotel rooms. Time proceeds as it does in the real world. I'd say it is close watching an actual trial proceed, which can be very slow, even if the case itself is fascinating. Had this been shot this way on any less fascinating a subject, it would probably be viewed by no one. So if you can't stand this old way of documentary film making, this is probably not the film for you.",1434499200,139,1777,4.6025236593059935

There is no question that Snowden committed a federal crime when he revealed this information, and that he knew he was committing a crime. He also knew that this would destroy his career and probably result in a long prison sentence.
Exactly what motivated Snowden and why he did this, knowing the consequences, has never before been completely explained. The responses from the US government, while not being exactly lies, have been misleading and incomplete.
What is sure is that most people, including the officials that held hearings on this have only a vestigial understanding of what metadata is and how it can be used. Every American should view this video to see more clearly both sides of this issue in order to make a fully informed judgement.
In spite of the government's accusations, Snowden was very careful that he did not release any information that would compromise any agent or reveal information on US government surveillance except reveal that it was being done. He gave this information to American journalists, not any foreign country and not for any benefit to himself. The tragedy is that while the US government says that he will receive fair due process of law if he comes to the US, the crimes he is charged with are under a law from world war I, long before today's electronic data communication. This law was intended for spies acting for foreign countries and presumes Snowden is such a spy. There is no legal defense against this law, even if the actions of the government he released are judged to be illegal.
Persons buying this video should make sure that it is rated for their region. Region 0 is nowhere and wilt not play on any DVD machine.

7008839,5,B00TGF9GGO,"The most important film you will see all year - possibly ever - is Citizenfour. This is the single-most groundbreaking documentary Ive ever laid eyes on, surpassing some of Michael Moores greatest works. The amount of people that will be affected due to the information in this film is staggering. Every American owes it to themselves to see this. It will undoubtedly change the way you operate and think in more ways than one.

As you may already know, the film centers around Edward Snowden, the much-talked about whistleblower that leaked an enormous amount of top secret information concerning the National Security Agency. It revealed the many ways that the NSA was spying on billions of people, creating a huge political conversation.

However, Citizenfour in no way participates in that conversation. It doesnt try to debate whether it was right or wrong for them to do that, it leaves all of that up to its subject. Thats one of the countless reasons why it succeeds. It isn't a documentary that needs a ton of flare, its actually quite the opposite. It states the facts, lets us decide how we feel about it, and all in the most simplistic and brilliant manner.

The majority of it takes place in one hotel room where Laura Poitras (the director of the film) and Glenn Greenwald (the first journalist to leak the story) listen to everything Snowden has to say. We watch them go over the program files and documents that serve as the evidence of what the NSA has done - scenes that include astounding stats and figures - those being some of the most powerful moments Ive ever witnessed.

7008862,5,B00TGF9GGO,"This will be a tough review to write because no matter how I present it, 50% of you will disagree with me. Is Edward Snowden an irresponsible hacker like Julian Assange with WikiLeaks, or is he a patriotic man who is alarmed to see loss of liberties in democratic nations?

This R-rated documentary is narrated by a woman who had begun receiving encrypted emails offering evidence of illegal covert surveillance programs run by government agencies. They were signed ""Citizenfour."" Five months later she secretly met with him in Hong Kong, along with reporters Glenn Greenwald and Ewen MacAskill of the Guardian. She brought her camera....

Here is what jumped out at me:
  * Snowden's sole thrust is exposure of governmental overkill; it is not to divulge secret operations, endanger intelligence agents or become personally famous.
  * During the early part of the filming (in Hong Kong), he was still anonymous. By the time he gave an example of how monitoring can be done on our phone even when it is in the cradle, we could see that he is careful, not paranoid. He unplugged his phone....
  * Back in the United States, his auto pay for his rent stopped working and his girlfriend had five days to move out; utility vans lined the street where she lived.
  * Under the Patriot Act, our government and others like ours, can harvest all communications: this includes phone calls (both land- line and cell), E-mails, texts, Tweets, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc., etc... Take a look at the enormous new data storage facility under construction in Utah. (BTW: The UK is even more aggressive than the US.)
  * He is angry that Obama made a point of criticizing our government after 9/11, saying that we should never infringe on private citizen's lives unless they were proven security threats, but now, under Obama, surveillance has increased exponentially.
  * As soon as his name was divulged, the government wanted an investigation: NOT to discover why it is monitoring its citizens, but to ascertain WHO LEAKED SNOWDEN'S STORY. He insists that HE is not the story, abuse of power is.
  * The government has a list of over ONE MILLION American citizens who are currently on the Enemy's List. Snowden was shocked.
  * Journalist Glenn Greenwald is at least bilingual. He seems to be sensitive to the security aspects of the project but is also very much an activist when it comes to exposing government surveillance.

This isn't the most thrilling documentary I have ever seen, but it is endlessly fascinating. Director Laura Poitras brings us a personable and intelligent young man who impressed me as a patriot. Plus he looks like one of my relatives who is a former Marine and, I would like to think, brave enough to do something similar.",1431734400,109,2736,4.84516129032258

7008868,5,B00TGF9GGO,"This documentary is well done and worth watching even if you have been following the Snowden saga in the news and on the internet. Poitras' work provides a humanistic view of Snowden and gives him a platform to express his motivations in a way that the mainstream media never did. In his own words, Snowden says that this is about ""state power against the peoples ability to meaningfully oppose that power... if the [government] policy switches, [which is] the only thing that restrain these states, no one can meaningfully opposed the state.""

In other words, the walls have been erected around us, a massive surveillance state designed to vacuum up information on every aspect of our lives. Were highly dependent on technology that most of us have no hope of understanding, and our own government has expended enormous expense to infiltrate that technology in order to be able to monitor us. Why would they do such a thing? As William Binney, former NSA official and whistleblower, says in the film:

""All these programs Edward Snowden has exposed fundamentally are ways of acquiring information. Every dictatorship down through history has always done that. One of the first things they need to do is try to acquire knowledge of their population. That is exactly what these programs do.""

More people need to wake up to the reality of what has been built in the name of the American people, a reality that Snowden sacrificed so much to expose. But even holed up in a hotel room in Hong Kong, facing a highly uncertain future, Snowden expresses a wonderful attitude:

""Im not afraid, and I don't think other people should [be] either... the balance of power between the citizenry and the government is becoming that of the ruling and the ruled, as opposed to the elected and the electorate.""

But it doesnt have to be that way. Watch this documentary and wake up to what has been secretly done in our names behind the veil of national security, never forgetting that we, the people of the world, hold the ultimate power to change things for the better.",1431561600,2,2054,4.790960451977401

It provides context about the events that take place in the film, the documents and the programs they disclose, so I recommend pairing the two.

After so much about this story in the media, with John Oliver cracking jokes with Snowden in Russia, and so on - people might discount the significance of citizenfour: it was filmed BEFORE the documents were leaked.  This point is made explicit when Ewen MacAskill interrupts Snowden to ask, amusingly, ""I'm sorry, I don't even know your name.""

It's the biggest US security breach of all time, being documented in real-time.  We all know now how it played out, but at the time, the gravity of everything must have weighed heavily on the participants.  Personally, I would have been sick.

I also appreciated how Laura Poitras chose scenes to serve as a harbinger of a potential dystopian future.  The act of scrupulously placing a towel over one's head before entering a password, just in case you're being watched.  The civil-rights lawyers putting cell phones in the refrigerator, evoking Orwellian paranoia.  These scenes illustrate what will happen to us if we decide that privacy is not important.

Other appearances by privacy advocates help tie the dialog together, which naturally is in favour of digital rights and freedoms.

The film even has a happy ending, but I won't ""disclose"" it here :)

Regardless of your options, see the film, read books, think, and debate but don't be defiant because you love America and hate terrorism; this film is about neither.",1431388800,2,1738,5.4440298507462686

The film is careful to document the timeline and the decisions made as anticipated and unexpected events occurr and more uncertainty about his fate grows as a media circus descends on Hong Kong and the pundits begin to spin Snowden's story before anyone knows his true agenda. It leaves room to interpret Snowden's actions in however you wish to view them, but none of the negative reviews I've read in here contextualize that, but are instead just right-left talking point condemnations from people that apparently haven't seen the film.

7008899,5,B00TGF9GGO,"As a foreign national, I had a hunch that this was going on. Back around 2002 President GW Bush visited the Charlotte, North Carolina area while I was visiting a friend during time off from work. I'd call it a vacation, but all I did was walk around Durham while my friend was at work. (I was also a temp worker and consultant.) People tell me that I look like a cop or ex/military, so the cops in the Durham started following me around. Maybe, I looked like I was scoping out the town while The President was nearby. I soon left Durham to return to New York City, which was also GWB's next stop. And here I ran into funnily dressed white dudes in Black neighborhoods and cops at ground level when I exited the subway. I could tell that they were avoiding looking at me, so their game was back on from NC. How could they know that I was meeting a client on the Upper East Side? My tech work order had come by e-mail. I promptly sent out a blast message to my friends that my e-mail was being monitored. I have since lost access to my mail archive (marcos@cloud9.net), but I am pretty sure that some friends have my message in their old accounts.

This was also back before Mark Klein & ATT's tap in Room 641A. So I was way ahead with my hunch. I sounded like a loon to my friends then, but all these years later, I turned out to be right.

The US has been good to me and my family after 30 years, but as an old reader of George Orwell, I can say that some things are going down the drain. When the very sci-fi that I read as a boy and teenager, such Asimovs as psychohistory gets picked up by the CIA, NSA, and FBI, you know that the game has turned serious.

7008910,4,B00TGF9GGO,"Laura Poitras is a documentary producer and cinematographer who also gets a director designation for this Oscar winning film.  It features the whistleblower event that rocked the world in 2013.  Earlier that year, she began receiving anonymous messages from someone inside the cyber-spy unit of the National Security Administration.  Eventually the individual sets up a meeting in Hong Kong with Poitras and 2 journalists from the London Guardian, Glenn Greenwald and Ewen MacAskill.  The individual turns out to be Edward Snowden and he has absconded with top secret material, leaving his post in Hawaii where he worked for Booze Allen Hamilton, a consulting firm working with the U. S. Government.

Poitras, essentially films the meetings, held in Snowden's hotel room.  Early on we see footage of Snowden setting the ground rules and working with the journalists, teaching them some of the finer art of decryption.  All of this is seen as it happens and the film suggests that Snowden isn't necessarily looking for glory or fame.  He is basically relying on the journalists to decide what information is to be released.  He has not told his parents or his girlfriends or any of his co-workers what he was going to do.  He rightly feared that they would be tormented by the government.

What comes to light, of course is that the U. S. Government has been gathering metadata on foreigners, foreign governments, including allies and even their own citizens without their knowledge.  And he has the proof.  He attempts to get refugee status in China, but the government is considering an extradition request from the U. S.  Before the matter is resolved, Snowden catches a flight to Russian, arranged by another persona non grata, Julian Assange.  Assange of Wikileaks fame, is actually caught on film talking with Snowden from his room at the Ecuadorian embassy in London where he is ensconced. In the interim, Poitras and her crew focus on Greenwald, the Guardian and Brazil, where it was uncovered that the U. S. was spying on this South American neighbor.

The film moves along nicely for the most part, although much times is spent just watching Snowden, even his grooming habits.  Political documentaries are not necessarily fair and balanced nor do they have to be.  Still the film leaves a lot of questions.  How did Snowden choose Poitras and the journalists?  Other that the stock answer of preventing terrorist attacks, what is the rationale they believe is behind collecting all of this data?  Has the data prevented any attacks?  Do other governments spy on the U. S.?  Regardless of whether you believe Snowden is a hero, a traitor or something in between, one has to admit that he unearthed some embarrassing, enlightening and downright scary facts about our government's clearly unconstitutional tactics.",1430092800,4,2820,5.0562770562770565
7008911,5,B00TGF9GGO,"I purchased through iTunes as I saw it for sale there first. This is the side of the story we were unable to see initially. I was quite saddened to hear President Obama's remark that what Ed did was illegal and that we should have a dialogue,etc. We know how dialogues goes in Washington, especially when money is involved. We should have a dialogue though --- on why the US Government isn't arresting those in places of power for abusing their power. What Ed did was blow the whistle on unconstitutional spying of US Citizens, and the people and governments of this planet. This revelation should be served with investigations and arrests of those committing these acts but instead an old law is used to ensure Ed has no ability to defend himself. Ed is a hero. And his revelations should be a warning to us all that while we spend our days worrying about the latest reality star, the next game on FB, the next selfie or the next tweet from our favorite celeb or sports star, our privacy was being stripped away by our own government. I am thankful to those who took huge risks to bring us this information, this documentary and for those who broke the stories around the world.",1430006400,304,1179,4.514018691588785

Forever preserved is the nuance and detail. We get to watch Ed make his decisions in real time. Even he does not know what exactly will happen next. This is real journalism and human drama.",1531785600,,358,4.790322580645161
8701619,5,B00TGF9GGO,Very informative no matter the political side you fall on. I was shocked in Snowden to learn he was a Bush supporter and conservative but later hoped Obama would get the illegal spying under control as promised. What turned out was it actually got worse under Obama. This is something both sides have dirt on their hands with. As Americans we need to stop this no matter your political beliefs. I consider myself a strong military supporting hawk conservative and went into this thinking the guy was a sale out spy. I could be wrong here and he could be working with the Russians. Who really knows but I believe in the constitution and you should too. We need to get back to it!,1531612800,,678,4.475806451612903
