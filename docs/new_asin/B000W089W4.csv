2960146,5,B000W089W4,"PCU:

The movie has a pretty star studded cast.  Jeremy Piven (Entourage, Rush Hour 2, Smokin' Aces, Cars), Jon Favreau (Swingers, Iron Man, I Love You Man), David Spade (Tommy Boy, SNL, Rules of Engagement), Jessica Walter (Mother in Arrested Development) and Alex Dsert (Swingers, Becker).

The movie is a tight 90 minutes about a Senior in High School (Tom Lawrence, played by Chris Young) who is visiting PCU (Port Chester University) for the day, because he is interested in attending.  Piven's character is signed up, as a prank, by a friend (Alex Dsert) to show around ""the pre-frosh""(Tom) the School.  Piven is in a frat that is dwindling in numbers and has a bad rep.  The school, according to many of the characters, is drowning from being politically correct.  Piven, Young and Dsert cause some trouble and need to get some money to bail them selves out.

The movie is the story of how they do it, things that stop them and has many different good themes, that if I tell you may give away too much of the plot.

The movie is well written, has a lot of heart and has you understanding who the characters are without much explanation.  The movie is from 1994 and it shows, but doesn't take much away from it.  In the end, what you have is a funny, entertaining movie worth watching.  I recommend this movie for anyone who likes Piven or quirky, off beat comedies like Eurotrip.",1312416000,2,1386,4.5894308943089435
