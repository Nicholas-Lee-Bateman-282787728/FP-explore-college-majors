6839444,5,B00Q05H6U6,This is a superb and moving film about a sensitive and oft-overlooked subject -- Hep C as a killer and those who strive mightily to overcome it and their drug addictions.  The story of Junior alone is worth watching the film.  It's brilliantly directed.,1422316800,4,253,4.7272727272727275

6839449,5,B00Q05H6U6,"Heartbreaking and real, yet ultimately hopeful and even triumphant, this sensitive and intelligent documentary tells the poignant stories of a group of men and women in the Bronx struggling with years of drug addiction and facing the additional challenge of living with Hepatitis C.  You will cry and you will laugh and will find yourself rooting for and caring about each one as his or her story unfolds.  Told with compassion and humanity and extremely relevant. Additionally, the recent availability of a cure for Hep C remains inaccessible to most because of its exorbitant cost, and an impossibility for those that live in states that offer no Medicaid to  single males who are a targeted population for Hep C.",1430092800,2,715,4.991596638655462

6839452,5,B00Q05H6U6,"If you are looking for one documentary film to watch, choose THE FIX. I was floored by the creative and artistic expertise of the director, Laura Naylor. The Fix draws you in...completely. With a storyline so honest and artistically captivating, THE FIX depicts  life on life's terms as it shares the reality of heroine addiction and hep c. A true, and much needed story of redemption. Bravo!",1422921600,,392,4.850746268656716

Extraordinary.",1422403200,2,108,7.384615384615385
6839454,5,B00Q05H6U6,"This documentary truly is amazing in so many ways.  The subject matter is very hard for me to watch but at the same time it is important because
this is REAL life and the vision of educating us to Hep-C and the importance of clinics and outreach for those who suffer substance abuse is vital
to making a difference.  The director Laura Naylor nailed it and her documentation of the journey of Junior will leave you sobbing because of his addiction and suffering but also happy that he has found a way to witness to others about help and he is lifting himself up at the same time.",1422403200,,579,4.351851851851852
8689964,3,B00Q05H6U6,"One issue that bothered me, and I've seen this on other addiction documentaries-- While it's great for people to desire to become clean, people shouldn't use their kids as the main excuse to ""get clean"". What happens when these cute children become teenagers? Their parents start abusing them. Their parents devalue them, or just give birth to more ""cute babies"" to fulfill their emotional needs, leaving the older children to raise the younger or to fend for themselves. People shouldn't use children as tools to make themselves ""better"". One should be ""better"" before having kids. It's not the child's job to fix the parent. People shouldn't have babies in order to ""fix"" themselves or to ""make sure someone loves me forever!"", which is also a common excuse. I just finished another documentary where one of the subjects said, ""my cute baby is keeping me clean!"" This kind of thing gives the false impression that having children fixes one's addictions or psychological problems, which is a dangerous message to give.",1518998400,,1019,5.035502958579881

8689968,5,B00Q05H6U6,"I loved it!!!  At last, a positive narrative about the people society wants to toss aside.  We all are worthy of second chances.  I'm overjoyed to know that the recovering addicts profiled in The Fix have earned their sobriety.  It's unbelievably exciting and humbling to see them fight to just simply live, to have more time to make amends and to give back, all the while knowing that this chronic disease of the brain affords very little success.  All this while living with the stigma of methadone maintenance and then heap on top of this already huge uphill climb-their hepC status and in some cases the chronic disease of HIV.  I just loved it-I sobbed and I cheered these brave folks and hope for their continued sobriety and health and everything else they desire !!!!  They earned it all !!!!!!",1489881600,,802,4.685714285714286
8689969,5,B00Q05H6U6,"This is a very powerful story of how a young man was able to take his life of heroin addiction, addiction related illness (HepC), and sadness and turn it into a message of hope, success, and love! Addiction is a very terrible DISEASE, that with time, support, education, and the Lord on your side, that people can make it through...successfully! Junior shows how this was accomplished. Awesome story!!",1488499200,,401,4.911764705882353
