6676499,5,B00NPYKTP4,"This Gamera bundle is the finest in knock off giant monster movies. It's the highest quality version I've come across. While not as enjoyable as the MST3K treatment, it's everything you've ever wanted in giant flying turtle movies.",1423958400,3,231,5.105263157894737

6676502,4,B00NPYKTP4,"This is probably the best way you can watch the Showa and Heisei Gamera Series.  The video quality of the Showa films is probably as good as these movies will likely  become, but the sound is pretty dated (they are B-Movies after all).  My only real complaint is that the menu only allows you to watch the movies in the Show movies.  There is no scene selection nor different audio tracks.",1423094400,13,389,4.436619718309859

6676505,4,B00NPYKTP4,Great to see these movies in their original form on Blu-ray at a low price. My only complaint would be not having an option for an English dub. These movies are all Japanese with English subtitles. That's OK for me but kids won't sit through subtitles.,1418169600,30,252,4.5
6676506,5,B00NPYKTP4,"Great to see another collection, but I'm gonna go ahead and call shenanigans on the 9999 run-time.",1414627200,9,98,4.823529411764706

6676508,3,B00NPYKTP4,"You know what you're getting here -- the first 11 Gamera films, most of which are not dubbed, just subtitles, which I prefer.  No problem here.

I hate the packaging.  The four individual cases are fine, but the slip case is for them is atrocious.  I bought mine new and it arrived torn up and falling apart.  It's the thinnest cardboard I've ever seen, basically a piece of paper folded around the individual cases.  That's my only gripe.",1473897600,5,439,4.564102564102564
6676509,2,B00NPYKTP4,"This set was not what I was expecting.  The first 8 films were not the dubbed versions which do exist.  They are Japanese with subtitles which were not well done.  Only the dialogue was subtitled.  Parts that had Japanese subtitles, did not have an english counterpart.  The last 3 were dubbed and subtitled.  But like the first films, the subtitles were incomplete.  I enjoyed the versions of these films released by Shout Factory, and Section 23 much more and would recommend them instead.",1473724800,6,491,4.843373493975903

6676517,4,B00NPYKTP4,"This is a fantastic collection and a great value. The HD transfer looks fantastic, even in the older entries in the series. Gamera films tend to be a little more kid oriented than Godzilla, but I'm OK with this, they are still loads of fun to watch. My only complaint on these releases (and the -1 star) is that there are no English dubs for the first 8 films. I watched a bunch of these on TV back in the 70's and I KNOW I didn't watch them with subtitles! I really wanted to introduce Gamera to my 8-year old daughter but she has to spend so much time trying to read the subtitles she barely has time to see what's going on the screen! If these had the English dubs this collection would be an easy 5 stars.",1453420800,15,709,4.107913669064748

6676519,4,B00NPYKTP4,"Hands down the best way to watch all the Gamera movies (besides Gamera: The Brave which is not included wtf). This comes with 4 classics on one disc, 4 on another, and each of the Heisei Gamera movies are on their own disc although first 2 Heisei movies share a disc case which is dumb if you want to display the cases on your shelf. Still, 22$ for 11 movies is a crazy good deal.",1452643200,3,380,4.08

8679722,1,B00NPYKTP4,"This review is on August 10, 2017 so the pricing may update in the future.  You can get all 11 movies on blu ray from Mill Creek in three separate sets.  These three sets add up to 4 blu ray discs overall (just like this package).  If you purchase those three sets, you will pay a little over $30.  Why is this bundle of all 11 films priced over $80???  Certain films are in Japanese only with English subtitles (no English dubbing) just like the three individual sets.  It does not appear that there are any additional bonus features in this bundle set, but even if there are, I can't imagine it adding up to $50 in value.  I just don't understand the price......
