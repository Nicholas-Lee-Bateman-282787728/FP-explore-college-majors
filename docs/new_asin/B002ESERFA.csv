8368320,1,B002ESERFA,"I was hoping this film would share information that we may not have known about the Pope along with insights that only a private secretary could have witnessed and be able to share.  There is really nothing new in this film that is worthwhile watching.  Some snippets of film clips that you may not have seen before.  However when you compare it to other documentary films on the life of Pope John Paul II this one is very poor and not worth the money.  I would recommend another film - SAINT FOR OUR TIME - which is much more interesting, far more thorough and often moving.  I am sorry that this film is so poor.

What is also a bit disorienting is how the film makers use 're-inactments' so that you aren't sure what is real footage and what is acted.  And the use of special effects to give you that 'old film quality' is used so often and repeated so often it becomes annoying.  On top of that there is the narration of Michael York, whose beautiful voice is very soothing and then we hear the voice of the Cardinal, who is speaking Polish and there is a voice over placed over the original Polish narration.  Sometimes the sound is not good and the narrator is not clearly heard over the original Polish.  Subtitles should have been used for the Polish narrative of the Cardinal and use only Michael York for the narration.

The film completely dismisses the Popes unusual and strong relationship with the Holy Mother from the time He was a young man and most especially after the death of His mother when the Pope was only 8 years old.  This I found to be very strange.  There was more of a focus on the Holy Spirit rather than the Holy Mother, which is well documented in many other films and books as well.

The film does cover the end of Communism in Poland, which seems to have been the real reason behind this film.  However there is little information regarding many of the important Polish churches which were dear to Pope John Paul II.

All in all this is a poorly made film, with no new information, the DVD cover is even misleading and there are plenty of other films out there that are much better.  I would include the very beautiful SANTO SUBITO in that list.",1277337600,2,2179,4.394014962593516
8368321,5,B002ESERFA,"This documentary provides much new information which was not revealed in some older documentaries. It gives some insights into the great sanctity and heroic virtues of this beloved pontiff as well as interesting facts about him (e.g. he performed an exorcism with great efficacy, and he was stabbed in a second assassination attempt, etc.). Watching this film inspires a greater admiration for Blessed John Paul II. It includes nice extras: a making-of documentary and a slide show with quotes of the late Holy Father. Highly recommended.",1258243200,5,538,5.267441860465116
