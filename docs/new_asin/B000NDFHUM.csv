8176919,5,B000NDFHUM,With the Duke you can not go wrong and this collection is all right,1443571200,,67,3.857142857142857
8176920,4,B000NDFHUM,"Not dukes best but is nice selection of movies of the duke,would recommended if your true duke movie fan !",1361318400,,106,4.35
8176921,5,B000NDFHUM,"I don't have this collection, but I have most of these (public domain) films, so here's my 2 cents worth: 10 discs of John Wayne movies and additional related material for $40, list - if you bought this collection expecting anything in the range of 3 to 5 star movies for that price and were disappointed by what you got, consider this a very inexpensive lesson in reality. You're just not gonna get lots of great movies so inexpensively. However, if you're interested in some of the rest of the Duke's massive output, this is an amazing collection, for almost pocket change, especially if you buy it used.

While most of the movies are flawed low budget quickies, they are typical of the pulp novels I've read from the early 20th century and therefore, nice examples of the origins of the Hollywood western. In other words, they are simple good guy vs. bad guy adventure stories, the kind your grand parents or great grand parents might have grown up with. Not for everyone, but a real treat for those who really love John Wayne, or are curious about B movie history.

The 5 stars are for the value, as much as for the content.",1313798400,2,1128,4.5245098039215685
8176922,4,B000NDFHUM,"I bought this as a gift for my dad who LOVES John Wayne and has seen about every movie he has ever been in...i like the fact that it had unseen footage and it was a very good price.  I wish i had more information to offer, but i have a great dad and he would never tell me if he didn't like a gift his daughter gave him!!!",1297641600,,322,3.6666666666666665
8176923,5,B000NDFHUM,"Believe it or not John Wayne got his training in B pictures and serials ground out by the Poverty Row movie studios such as Mascot and Monogram. This set presents in chronological order his B pictures and one or two A pictures.

The big draw here is all 16 of his Lone Star Westerns that he ground out for Monogram from 1933-35. It was in these early pictures that Duke and another performer/stuntman Enos ""Yakima"" Canutt began revolutionizing screen fighting techniques that would make these early 5 day oaters a part of screen history.

Also in one of the most ludicrous casting decisions in cinematic history, in ""Riders of Destiny"" his very first Lone Star picture cast him as Singin' Sandy Saunders a singing cowboy. If that doesn't make you scratch your head or giggle in disbelief then obviously you have no idea who John Wayne is, let's just say his singing was dubbed and not very convincingly at that. Everytime he goes in for a showdown he begins to sing... that's clasic stuff here folks.

After that things get much better, because by ""Sagebrush Trail"" the second picture they dropped the singing act altogether.

For any western fan these pictures are veritable treasure chest of who's who of B western players. most notable for me are the presence of Earl Dwire, Yakima Canutt, George Hayes and Glenn Strange just to name a few.

As an irrelevant side note, when I originally watched these, they were scattered out of order across numerous Platinum Disc Corporation DVD's and I saw an interesting character development for George Hayes character, first he starts of as a good guy and John Wayne's friend, then in order to clear Duke of murdering him, he shaves off his mustache disguises himself as a woman. Seemingly driven insane by the loss of his mustache he turns bad and tries to Kill John Wayne.

Republic is represented here by both ""Winds of the Wasteland"" and ""Angel and the Badman"". The latter is easily one Duke's best films with the innocent beauty of Gail Russell as the Quaker who reforms Duke. Also notable for the first screen teaming of Duke and Bruce Cabot who would go on to appear together in 12 more movies through Big Jake. And not to be forgotten is John Wayne's boyhood idol, Harry Carey, Sr. as the marshal who doesn't believe that Duke can be reformed.

Winds of the Wasteland involves a stagecoach race for government contracts and of course a corrupt businessman tries to stop Duke and Lane Chandler from winning by any means necessary.

""His Private Secretary"" is an interesting early role for Duke, as he plays a good for nothing Playboy who falls hard for a girl and marries her despite his father's objections. In order to sway his father's opinion of her, she secretly takes a job as the father's secretary.  Watch for Al ""Fuzzy"" St. John in a brief part as the gas station attendant.

The serials are all great fun to watch and for those who never have seen Duke in his cliffhangers the curiosity factor will compel them to at least check them out. The best of the three is ""The Three Musketeers"" with appearances by Lon Chaney, Jr. billed here as Creighton Chaney, and Noah Beery, Jr.

The only negative thing here is the quality of the public domain print of McLintock! but I know you wouldn't buy this set for that movie, especially considering the awesome quality print available from Paramount authorized by the Wayne estate..

As for the bonus disc it's really more of a filler than anything of real importance to Duke fans. They could have slapped on various TV appearances and instead they went for 2 compilations of movie trailers, a really dumb and poorly put together tribute and possibly the only worthwhile bonus feature, ""No Substitute For Victory"".

This set is highly recommended for both the Duke fan and lovers of westerns and serials. And until someone sees fit to release these in fully restored prints this is the set I am going to recommend.

Legend films has released a handful these films restored, but unless you like horrible sounding synthesizer music added to your movies stay away from those.",1288396800,,4071,4.723554301833569
8176924,5,B000NDFHUM,"I AM a John Wayne fan, and I have only a few of these movies on other discs. I used to have some on tape. I WILL watch them more then once and they are some of the best movies you can get. A real John Wayne fan would really appreciate these older movies. The quality of older movies are not of the primary concern for a real fan. The story line, the action, the many aspects of what makes John Wayne, the Duke! His style can still be seen in these early films. I recommend them.",1240012800,5,478,3.9381443298969074

OK, I'm not the biggest John Wayne fan, but I am a fan of good old fashion, good guy, bad guy flicks that you wouldn't be ashamed to let your kids or mother watch.

8176927,1,B000NDFHUM,"Is your husband a John Wayne fan but you have no idea which movies to get him?  Save your money and skip this collection.  Most John Wayne collections consist of forgetable movies from early in John Wayne's career.  Amazon has a good collection of movies from later in his career, so concentrate on those instead.  Yes, they will cost more, but your John Wayne fan will actually watch them repeatedly, unlike the movies in this collection.  Some of my favorites are, The Shootist, The Cowboys, True Grit, The Sons of Katie Elder, Rooster Cogburn, Who Shot Liberty Valence, War Wagon, The Searchers, Rio Bravo, Big Jake, etc.",1180396800,21,624,4.794392523364486
