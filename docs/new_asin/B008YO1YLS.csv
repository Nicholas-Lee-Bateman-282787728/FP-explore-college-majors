8532614,5,B008YO1YLS,"FUNNY FUNNY FUNNY! Two of my favourite Brit actors June Brown (Dot from EastEnders) and Penelope Keith (Neighbours & To The Manor Bourn) in this slapstick farce about mistaken identity. The plot is reminiscent of Thelma & Louise, AbFab, Miranda, etc where gal pals get into all sort of problems that are hysterical. I won't reveal the plot here because it'll spoil the viewing if you purchase this DVD. It is spot on for comedy.",1505001600,,428,4.72
8532615,4,B008YO1YLS,"Extremely funny evening's viewing: Penelope Keith plays a wealthy, recently widowed lady, a pillar of the local neighbourhood watch. But when she thinks she's killed a young intruder, she and her cleaner - the superb June Brown - go on the run. Hilarious scenes abound - the jobsworth post office clerk who won't pay Gladys her pension; Margery's estranged son with his unhealthy interest in cleaning ; the Brummie hitch-hiker. We really enjoyed it.",1471824000,,449,5.081081081081081
8532616,1,B008YO1YLS,I am unable to play it on my DVD player.  It will only play on my computer.  I am trying to figure out how to return it to the states.  I thought I was ordering it from Canada.  Will never order a DVD again.,1438992000,,207,3.6363636363636362
