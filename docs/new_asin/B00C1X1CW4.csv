8576340,5,B00C1X1CW4,"Gloria Swanson is a god of cinema. A beautiful, stunning and master of silent cinema and so much more. She is a true goddess of the word mastery. Four excellent films of the silent era that should be seen, respected and honored.",1427673600,4,228,4.4523809523809526

8576342,3,B00C1X1CW4,"Two of the four DVD's were scratched and scuffed. They played OK, but if I buy something new I don't like it looking ""well used"" even if it's functional. Calling Gloria Swanson's character in ""The Danger Girl"" a ""vamp"" is a bit of a stretch. The movies themselves were interesting and it's probably worth getting the collection if you enjoy old silent movies. Just be aware you may get some scuffed DVD's.",1399420800,6,405,4.638888888888889
8576343,5,B00C1X1CW4,"This collection of Silent Era Vamps is really wonderful - if you love silent movies, you won't want to miss out on this collection! All are good but you definitely don't want to miss out on Theda Bara as the Vamp in A Fool There Was - you absolutely will not be able to deny her talent! Alla Nazimova is also excellent as Salome and truly does not look her age (she was 42 when she played this part). A couple of these films might leave you feeling a little unsettled but that's the power of silent film and a testament to the talented actresses of this era!",1388793600,16,558,4.175925925925926
