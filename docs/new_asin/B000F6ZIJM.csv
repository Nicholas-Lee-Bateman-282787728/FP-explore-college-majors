 This is a wonderful DVD Box Set released onto DVD by Kangaroo Entertainment along with Full Moon. Each one of the five DVD's comes in its very own DVD case with Highly Detailed DVD cover packaging. Special features are very pore on the DVDs. From what I have see. They only come with there original video zones and a mini trailer in the beginning advertising their website and also for their ""Puppet Master"" toys that are way out of print.

 Picture and audio quality is Great. Full Moon and Kangaroo Entertainment really did a great job on this Five Disc DVD Set. This is a must have for any Full Moon and gothic Horror fans.

So I had to throw them away.",1365897600,,357,3.76
2553508,4,B000F6ZIJM,"Okay, so yes as with most full moon productions the fx are cheesy, the stories are sometimes lacking, and in many cases the Subspecies  films are no exception, but Anders Hove who plays Radu is so perfectly sinister and horrifying that he makes these films downright creepy. I don't know weather its his raspy whisper of a voice or his 2ft long clawed fingers but his portrayal of a undead bloodsucker is one of the most frightening since count Orlaf in the 1920's. Along with ""Puppetmaster"" ""Subspecies"" is one of Full Moon finest franchises,  but make no mistake if your looking for ""Gone With The Wind"" go elsewhere. However, if you love good b horror flicks this is an absolute must.",1359244800,,687,4.669421487603306

This is as good as low-budget gets. When I bought this it had just come out and I loved every minute of this purchase. And I really couldn't afford it. But obviously had to have it. Skip to the present. I am now the owner of Subspecies 1,2 and 3 on Blu-Ray AND with 5.1 audio. So now I eagerly await the release of part 4, as well as Vampire Journals, on Blu-Ray. On the Blu-Ray special features they're talking about a part 5 prequel. Very exciting. If you like Vampires I think you'll really enjoy these. Part one is the introduction to Radu so be patient. Parts 2, 3 and 4 are the better of the series. And Vampire Journals is a good Radu side story. You can stream 1 and 2 here on Amazon Instant Video. I'll bet you'll want to see 3, 4 and Vampire Journals afterward. :)",1356739200,,932,4.183333333333334
2553510,5,B000F6ZIJM,"subspecies is by far a wonderful story, Denice Duff and Anders Hove are wonderful on screen together and so are the other actors in this series.

The whole story is mainly about Michelle and Radu a  nosveratu vampire who is suppose to get an ancient relic called the bloodstone but instead of him getting it  radu has a brother named stephan who is the younger and more human like vampire who falls in love with michelle and who by their father is suppose to get this relic. radu in the biginning kills his father and takes the bloodstone. radu is the eldist and the first born he is the rightful owner of the bloodstone. michelle is a human and with her friends go to transyilvania to study up on the legand of vampires. as the story goes on radu bites michelle and changes her into what he is, that of an undead vampires. radu kills is entire family for michelle because he loves her deeply and wants her to love him and be his fledgling. michelle loves stephan but with his death michelle has no choise for her heart has she stives to deal with her vampire nature and bloodcravings. radu contantly gets betrayed by michelle with her stabbing him, shooting him and and running away radu continues to love her and keep her forever with him. michelle and radu's love is completely tragic his love for her is so great that he will do anything for her dispite him being evil and undead.

10/10 this series is wonderful and tragic at the same time love makes you do the waky and for radu's case it really does! for those who love tragic vampire stories this box set is one you will keep in your heart forever!",1355961600,,1606,4.397306397306397

2553512,2,B000F6ZIJM,"I ordered this collection, as a childhood favorite of mine... The movies themselves are great... The packaging had flaws- some of the discs were loose in their cases and were jumbling around as I opened the box... Luckily, no major damage.... My BIGGEST PROBLEM would be that on my first movie,  although there IS sound, there are no voices.... The background music plays, general movement sounds are there, but when the characters talk, their lips move and no sound comes out.... It's baffling to me- I don't know how this is possible, but it  makes the movie practically unwatchable with no dialogue whatsoever... I suspect I may have gotten bootlegs or something? I clearly don't understand how the voices are just GONE.... Pretty disappointed... Luckily, I tested the second movie and the voices are there...",1354233600,,812,5.007407407407407

2553514,3,B000F6ZIJM,"Back in 1986, Ted Nicolaou's movie ""Terror Vision"" was the first horror movie i've watched as a kid. I remember the movie scared the hell out of me and my sister back then. We actually never forgot it and over the years it became some sort of cult classic for us as we kept wondering if one of us knew what it actually was and if we remembered anything from it at all. Do you remember that monster in the indoor pool near the end? Do you remember Medusa ? Do you remember those creatures coming from the TV ? These scenes stayed with us for years and years but sadly, we weren't able to put a name on it. It was not until a year and a half ago that i was finally able to find it by googling the scenes i remembered and visiting horror movie forums to get a name. From there it became easier and i been able to join a lot of dots in horror from the 80's until the present day.

Aside from the sexy Medusa Character, who was a bit like Elvira (mistress of the dark).The subspecies movies never were a big cult-horror hit but they've been on the shelves of video stores in VHS format for years and years from the 80's until the end of the 90's, which made it available for thousands of horror fans in America for over 10 years. We can still buy a Medusa costume for halloween in 2012 !!! You don't see this anymore these days as most older movies with no big success gets sold or damaged and simply never replaced. The first 3 movies are introducing us to the vladislav family, with the king, Radu and his mother. The movies follows three college students, Mara, Michelle (main female lead in the series), and Lillian, as they begin a study on Romanian culture and superstition in an ancient castle located in the small town Prejnar in Romania. At their arrival, the girls will soon realise that this place is not safe and they will have to face the evil that lives in the castle with them. Radu is a very cruel vampire who, aside from trying to gain control over the ""Bloodstone"", has lots of plans for the girls.

Despite the fact that its a B movie from the 90's, the acting here is very good, almost surprising sometimes. The photagraphy is something special here, it is slightly different from a movie to another in the box set because those films have been shot from 1991 until 1998, so there is a lot of different things happening here. The first one's photagraphy reminds us of the 90's but has a very distinct clarity to it, so clear its almost foggy..(does that make any sense?)I think the temperature played a role in the cinematography as well. To a certain extent, the cinematography almost becomes soothing. The 2nd and third installment are better of course as they are more recent, the picture quality is now the standard B horror movie picture, characterised by stronger colors and more effective lighting.

The last 2 installments are not as good as the first 3 ( The story no longer follows Michelle), but still follows some kind of logical pattern with the vampires and the bloodtone. Subspecies is not the ""big"" thing, i don't think its an ""essential"" or a cult horror classic but it still deserved to be known mostly as a tribute to  B movies in the 90's, Vampires, Soft nudity, Gothic Horror and of course, Blood.

ENJOY!!!!",1351382400,2,3244,4.409015025041736
2553515,5,B000F6ZIJM,This subspecies epic collection is awesome no searching for the other movies the second the third the fourth and the fifth movie their all in one package the first subspecies movie is cheesy in the graphics but a new take on the classic the vampires are killed differently by silver blessed bullets and cutting of the head and burning the body after mounting the head on a pole to be destroyed in the sun. This movie is not a classic the lines the actors have are non stonefaced but with natural reactions. I recomend this movie to those who miss the 2000 horror from full moon entertainment its right up there with the puppet master collection.,1341964800,,645,4.568965517241379
2553516,3,B000F6ZIJM,"Ah, vampire B-movie schlock. Not big blockbusters starring Anne Rice vamps or Stephenie Meyer sparklepires, but lower-budget affairs splattered with blood.

One of the best examples of the genre is ""Subspecies,"" a movie series with a genuinely creepy villain and lots of atmosphere. ""Subspecies The Epic Chronicles"" brings together all four ""Subspecies"" movies -- plus a delightfully goofy spinoff film, ""Vampire Journals"" -- following the vampire Radu's pursuit of a pretty but utterly useless American girl.

""Subspecies"" introduces us to the evil, ghoulish Radu (Anders Hove), a vampire who murders his own father to gain the mystical Bloodstone. Three grad students are visiting nearby in a small Romanian village, and Radu takes the opportunity to attack them. But his sensitive brother Stefan and an elderly Romanian man are out to save the day!

""Subspecies II: Bloodstone"" has Michelle (Denise Duff) escaping to Bucharest with the Bloodstone, and calling on her sister Becky (Melanie Shatner) for help. But Radu is determined to find her -- and now he has his dusty ""mummy"" to help him. ""Subspecies III: Bloodlust"" has Michelle back in Radu and Mummy's grasp, transported back to the remote castle. As she's educated in the ways of the vampire, she begins to slip into darkness... and Radu begins to fall in love.

""Subspecies: Bloodstorm"" deposits Michelle in the care of a very creepy doctor who claims to be able to cure her vampirism. Meanwhile, Radu descends on one of his fledglings, the music-loving Ash (Jonathon Morris) at his casino in Bucharest, seeking a place to stay while he reclaims his ""pretty one.""

And ""Vampire Journals"" is TECHNICALLY a spinoff, but except for the character of Ash, it has little in common with the other movies. Tortured vampire Zachary (David Gunn) is determined to kill all vampires of his bloodline, including Ash. But when Ash targets a beautiful pianist, Zachary will risk everything to save her -- including his life.

The ""Subspecies"" series is a pretty cheesy piece of work -- lots of naked boobs, goopy blood and hilarious death scenes (head-stab to death! Dismemberment! Decapitation!) permeate all the movies. However, it's a fun kind of cheesy. It's the kind of cheesy that you want to get popcorn for, rather than scoffing at -- and it's definitely more hardcore than ""Twilight.""

The movies do have their ups and downs, though. ""Subspecies"" is a fun, fun movie; ""Bloodstone"" and ""Bloodlust"" have their flaws (Michelle's total uselessness, mainly), but they are still entertaining little horror movies with the same overall tone. There's lots of Romanian castles and clubs, rural festivals and vampire attacks, and director Ted Nicolaou keeps each movie flowing from one to the next.

The problem is ""Bloodstorm,"" which is an abomination in every way -- continuity, characterization, tone and even makeup are hideously disrupted. What about ""Vampire Journals""? Well... it's pretty awful. But it's fun in its pretentious neo-gothic/romantic Anne-Ricean style.

The characters, however, are a mixed bag. Hove is a deliciously disgusting villain, with his stringy fingers, ghoulish face and drooling mouth. But he also manages to inject some pathos into Radu in ""Bloodlust,"" where we see the vampire starting to grow sad. Shatner is quite good as a strong, independent heroine who just wants to rescue her sister, and Morris is quite elegant as Ash (even if he always sounds like he's swooning).

Sadly, Denise Duff's Michelle does little other than cry, scamper around whining, crying and hanging around Bucharest clubs in increasing gothic clothing. You'll get tired of her fast; the character is much better when played by Laura Tate. Stefan is possibly the wimpiest vampire in existence (he's immobilized by a NET), and ""Mummy"" may actually be a mummy that someone dug up and put on puppet strings.

""Subspecies The Epic Collection"" brings together the good, the bad, and the grotesquely ugly in this series. Three movies are good, one is horrendous, and one is a campy funfest -- definitely worth watching for fans of cheese.",1330128000,2,4087,5.167927382753404

2553522,4,B000F6ZIJM,"I was excited when I first found out about This entire series being put on DVD in hopes that they would be able to update it in every technical sense.  For the most part during the entire series they did.  THe visuals on the DVD's have been remarkably done and the picture is very crisp in viewing.  However, the only downside of the series on DVD was that the Sound could of been a lot better.  There were times whenthe music in the background was very hard to hear and took away from the general atmosphere of the storyline.  Other than that the Technical aspects of the movies have greatly been improved.

The movies themselves have been added to.  There were moments in the movies that were extended and it improved the storyline greatly.  I feel that Michelle's decent into vampirism throughout Subspecies I-IV was a sadding story because it showed how humanity could be corrupted.  Yet could show, in the face of evil,  one can trimph over it and still keep their humanity.  Along with Vampire Jounrals I thought the entire set was a great product and definately worth the price.",1264204800,2,1085,4.598958333333333

2553527,5,B000F6ZIJM,"The locations and sets alone make this direct-to-video series of films really quite extraordinary. Filmed in the city of Bucharest and the Transylvania region of Romania, Subspecies was one of the first films shot in post-Soviet Romania and many of the locations would go on to be used in a number of Full Moon productions. Angus Scrimm has a relatively minor role in the first film. The real star of most of this series is Anders Hove, an extremely talented and meticulous actor who brings a refreshing intensity to all his rolls. In this case, Hove portrays the character Radu, a ""Nosferatu-esque""  type vampire in the Masquerade sense of the word. Ted Nicolaou directs; his masterful use of backlighting and shadows give the films a genuinely gothic feel. If you are a fan of Full Moon this series is one of their best. The DVDs upconvert to widescreen 1080 dpi fairly well, although there is some occasional graininess. The sound is slightly substandard for DVD but still quite good.",1242518400,,987,4.840236686390533

Yes there is a lot of blood drooling from Radu's mouth at times (some may like that); but the reality of the locations and actual Romania people really adds to the feeling of actually being there (the nude scene of William Shatner's daughter is also very nice).

Filmed in ""vampire territory"" Romania, it displays terrifying scenes. Starring Anders Hove as ""Radu"" an evil vampire who's sidekick called ""Mummy"" is brilliantly portrayed by Pamela Gordon. They both do outstanding acting and portraying jobs. Other supporting stars are Angus Scrimm, Denice Duff, Melanie Shatner, Kevin Spirtas and Ion Haiduc as Romanian Police lieutenant Marin. This series is far more scary than anything produced on film of this genre since the early days of ""Nosferatu"". Definitely not to be missed by all horror films fans.

2553533,4,B000F6ZIJM,"I remember seeing the first Subspecies when I was just much younger, some 15 years ago. It was one of the very first vampire movie I had ever seen and it scared me to hell. Also, it made a huge impact on me. Since then I have developed this huge love for vampires and gothic fiction (I actually am doing my post-graduation on the subject...) as a whole.
Still, it had been a long time since I hadn't seen the movie. I had seen it that ONE time and never again. So, now, with this boxset, it was time to revisit the movie and get to see the sequels, which I had never seen before.
To my great surprise, I remembered vividly some of the stuff on the first movie (I was around 7 when I saw it). It has aged a bit, but the Romenian atmosphere of the movie is simply breathtaking. Filming on locations was essential for this movie. Radu, the evil vampire, is also one of the scariest I have ever seen. I was right from the beginning...
As for the sequels, it was very exciting for me to see how the story would continue, after all these years. And in the end, I guess I enjoyed Subspecies II and III even more than I enjoyed the first! These are truly scary movies.
The DVDs include short but effective docummentaries on the making of each one of the movies. This is money spent well.

I was hesitant to buy this box set, sight unseen, but I finally bit the bullet and bought it. And I am not disappointed. The pictures look slightly better than new VHS (ditto with the sound) and there is little for extras, but for fans of these movies who's tapes have long since disintigrated, this box set is more than worthy replacement!",1222732800,,555,4.5049504950495045
2553535,5,B000F6ZIJM,"It was only recently that I saw these films and I was greatly impressed. In my view, many other vampire films have drifted away from the vital essence of the genre, but this series has captured it perfectly. The gothic atmosphere, helped by filming in Romania, is wonderful. The characters are perfect; Anders Hove makes a wonderful villain; evil and yet with a touch of sadness and a bit of madness thrown in. Denice Duff is superb as the heroine struggling to maintain some of her humanity. All the other actors do a superb job as well; their characters really come to life. There are some great moments of suspense, intrigue, atmosphere and of course horror in all the films. There is even just a touch of humour occasionally. The director did a superb job with all these films. Don't miss these films if you like horror films. Of course the stories are far-fetched but they are wonderfully entertaining and perfectly capture everything that is needed for the best vampire films ever. I hope that one day Full Moon productions will make Subspecies V.

2553539,3,B000F6ZIJM,"I recently purchased this box set, because my wife and I both really enjoyed the first  two Subspecies films. When I received the box set, movies 3 & 4 were mislabeled (3 was 4 and vice versa), but the set as a whole was still enjoyable. If you like cheesy vampire films, this is recommended highly.",1211846400,,299,4.339285714285714

The only problem was that the 3rd disk actually plays the 4th movie & vice versa, you just have to change the cases around!",1209340800,2,295,4.345454545454546
2553541,5,B000F6ZIJM,I'm very pleased to have found this movie collection. Just wished it had a little bit more behind the scenes. For any Subspecies fan I would recommend getting this collection.,1205798400,,175,4.866666666666666
2553542,5,B000F6ZIJM,"I was thrilled to find the whole subspecies collection in one package deal. I didn't even realize there had been a 5th movie. The DVDs were of excellent quality. The documentaries accompanying each movie were a real treat for the ""Radu"" fan. I gave this collection to my daughter for her birthday: she used to watch the ""Radu"" movies as a child. We never thought we'd be able find the whole collection to share with her younger siblings. Now that we were able to find these movies through Amazon, Subspecies is again part of our family tradition. Truly a vampire afficionado flick.",1205107200,,581,4.705882352941177
2553543,4,B000F6ZIJM,"This is a great bargain for those that like the series.  The series is generally low budget - but done well enough that you don't notice it.
The disks don't have a lot of extras that come with it and there is no option to view one scene to another.  Overall, I think the first 3 movies are pretty good and I thought that last two movies were somewhat unnecessary and perhaps tried to tap into the fan base wanting for something more.  It's too bad too since most sequels tend to ruin a franchise.

subspecies - 4.5 stars, for a moment there I though the title referred to
humans as the subspecies - but nope - they refer to those little creatures that are born out of radu's blood.
subspecies 2 - 4 stars - titles 2 and 3 were made together and they have a similar feel to them.  The cast, acting, and production were exceptionally good (and also good looking - an important element in certain types of films - especially those that try to set a gothic/dark type of theme).
subspecies 3 - 5 stars - this is the only movie in the title I would consider to be ""great"" and a classic.  Although 1 and 2 were pretty good movies I will admit.  It is ""great"" movies that make you want to see the rest of the series.  You can usually find scenes from this movie on youtube and see if you like it or not.
subspecies 4 - 3.5 stars - the series seems to have lost its focus here and you can see in the interview to some extent why.  It feels like somewhat of a continuation and implausible wrap up of movie 3.  There are a lot of ideas thrown in the movie, but many of them just don't seem to go too well together.  Perhaps the director and producer should have kept to the kiss principle.
vampire cronicles 3.75 stars - this movie has a much different flavor to that of the other series (even series 4 felt somewhat different).  The acting is somewhat uneven - and if you have to think about the acting on a movie - it tells you either that someone didn't have enough money somewhere or someone just didn't care or get it right.  The movie feels like a recycled hash of a ideas from lot of other vampire movies (including the subspecies series itself).  There is also a lot more nudity in this one than the other series.  The movie just didn't captivate my interest even though the ending was actually well done.  Without Radu, you just didn't have the charisma or character presence that you had in the earlier films.",1201219200,5,2408,4.24780701754386
2553544,3,B000F6ZIJM,"Kudos!..on a great epic movies, loved watching it when i was a teen and was very happy to see them as a set and was in a collection box..however, bad film transfers to DVD with only decent audio made this collection a ""so-so""..even though, parts 1 through 3 and vampire journals were a tad ""grainy"" i truly enjoyed them the most..part 4 is where i had the problem of ""stop and go"" and then to barely playing at all..well, it was good while it lasted..lol..anyways, its a decent collection, but, i think anybody that does buy it should buy it for less than its really worth.

2553547,5,B000F6ZIJM,"Vampire movies have been with us throughout the years. Some were good while others were quite bad. The lead vampire has been seen as the king of evil and as a sensous male the woman couldn't resist. Then along comes Radu. Until Subspecies I was mixed about just who was my favorite vampire. Radu is the ultimate evil and someone you love to hate. The movies are all done in the tone of Tales From the Crypt and incorporate all the darkness of the good old horror flicks. Large shadows casted on walls warn you of the approaching evil. Though the acting isn't always the best, my interest was never shaken. I've waited a long time for this collection and have watched it twice already.",1185408000,4,684,4.48

Great picture quality and sound quality and terrific behind the scenes footage. I don't know what that other guy is talking about, they don't come in a single case all crammed together, they come in the standard box set like you would get from Best Buy or wherever...great movies, much better than the more recent Full Moon fare. A bargain at $50.00!",1184198400,4,498,4.8023255813953485
2553549,4,B000F6ZIJM,"I hold my hands up and honestly say i love the Subspecies films,i love the authentisity,i love the atmosphere,i love Radu's long wobbly fingers and messy eating habits,yeah i love these films,cheap,oh so cheap but good.

Its such a shame the film images haven't been cleaned up or remastered at all,they have the look of old video tapes but not even that ruins their spell over me.

Where the Radu Subspecies movies are dirty,squalid (and lovely) the Vampire Chronicles episode is aiming for the oppulance of Interview With A Vampire, it almost hits the mark as well,it has a sumptious quality and style that is the other end of the spectrum to the Radu films but they meet perfectly.

If you're a Goth (like me) if you like vampires (like me) then sink your teeth into this boxset,worth every penny (though the outer box is flimsy)",1176336000,4,832,4.684931506849315
2553550,4,B000F6ZIJM,"ok i will make this quick and painless. I Loved these films and others *like puppetmaster* but these were favorites, but alas seemed impossible to find a good set since the 1 ed set was poorly packaged and had terrible glitches well I am Pleased to announce this shiny New Set that I will summerize:

SubSpecies
Quality 5 star
Sound Very Good but not dolby surround
Extras: Yes *making of etc could have added menu for xtras*
Overall 4 star
there's good attension to detail in this movie in particular watch during the swordfight *you will see something you never see that would be natural in battle with a sword* **Spoiler Warning** yes indeed while his oponent is down he swings his Sword at His Legs! attension to details like this catch my keen eye! also swords bending and chipping also good detail! the ""subspecies"" demons were a great idea but sadly the effects were subpar at the time hence they look badly dated and poorly done.

Subspecies 2 Bloodstone
Quality: Below Average
Sound: very good *still no surround*
Extras: yes *cast & crew making of*
Overall: great movie but some graphical issues make this a 3 star
some flaws in the film and graininess also a little shaking of the picture in a few scenes better ""Bloodstone Prop"" Track 2 theres a half second pause glitch but its Very Minor.
its a great vampire flick slightly dinked by a few graphical problems that you really wouldnt notice unless you were Looking Specificly For Them. 3 star due to probs otherwise a definate 4 star if you can overlook this new editions flaws.

Subspecies 3 Bloodlust
Quality: Good
Sound Very Good as in the 1st movie
Extras yes.
Overall 4 stars
Note: Radu teaching Vampiric Powers in this one really was an excellent idea it's my favorite part. little tired of radu's deaths though

Subspecies 4 Bloodstorm
Quality Very Good as in 1st and 3rd movies
Sound Very Good
Extras yes more of the same
Overall Great. 1-4 do well gong from one into another for both the story and the plot *though nowadays this would have been a 3 part flick max just each being longer* great story, ""Bloodstone Prop ver 3.0 lol"" mr crispy is funny too also see the parts about the bloodstone in this one about it drives vampires into madness yet allows them to never need to feed off a human so long as they possess the Bloodstone cool eh?
ugh radu got bumped off yet again 4th time sheesh he should be dead now.
Still a great vampire flick anyone who loves vampires etc and needs something different to see, well this is it! all kinds of vamps from zombie type and nosferatu *radu* type also even some anne rice types *see 1st movie* Uber for any Major Vampire Fanatic.

Vampire Journals
Quality Very Good
Sound very Good
Extras yep same kind.
Overall a bit dull would have been better as a first movie but they tossed in a few names and lines from the other flicks to connect them together. this one isn't as great. 3 star
Notes: More ""anne Rice"" vampire types, Uber creepy locations throughout romania etc adds to the sinister feel!

Warning! Not sutable for children under 17 this is Mature
Nudity, Violence and Gore. a Must Own For vampire fans of Nosferatu types or standard. Enjoy!

2553551,5,B000F6ZIJM,"I just received my copies of these fabulous movies, and I am quite pleased.  I bought the 1998 redistribution of this box set, and it appears that the video transfer is better than the original DVD box set.  I have only watched one of the DVDs so far, but I am very happy with what I saw.  Sure, in the beginning of Subspecies 1, there is some minor oddities in the video, but the simple fact that these awesome movies are on DVD more than makes up for it.

  I was beginning to think I would have to make copies of my VHS version in order to ensure that I would always have a copy of these movies.  It would have been a shame if these movies would have been lost due to no transfer to modern media.",1173312000,6,699,4.021739130434782

8118329,5,B000F6ZIJM,"amazing movies, ive never seen them before and happened to catch some of part one and knew i had to own all of them...

so far, ive watched the first two parts and gotta say this is hands down my favorite vampire of all time, give it up to Radu!!!! man, he sure can make a entrance...

the best part about these movies is that awesome script, its epic and relentless, air-tight and amazing....the acting is great, the fx are awesome, the direction is awesome, and nothing is sugarcoated....vampires should be horrible creatures, not whiny little babies and this series gets it RIGHT.

awesome series and i recommend for ANY horror fan OR anyone who enjoys a awesome fantasy story. think Phantom of the Opera meets Freddy Kruger....poetically homicidal.

quick note on quality of discs: these are older movies, but i feel the DVDS are very good, at least for me, the picture looks ok, the sound is actually amazing, and the packaging is fine...i def. feel i got my moneys worth here.
