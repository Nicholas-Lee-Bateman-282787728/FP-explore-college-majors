8750331,4,B01BIHWCBI,"""The Sex Trade"" (2015) is a documentary film about the growth of sex work in recent years.  Most of the film is set in Quebec. The film is in English and French, with English subtitles.  Eve Lamont, the director, has been described in a press release as ""an experienced director and camera woman"" and as ""a free spirit who delves into social realities that are often overlooked.""  Lamont has been makiing documentaries since 2001, and in 2003 she won an award for the best Canadian feature documentary.

""The Sex Trade"" offers a close look at the world of paid sex in Quebec.  The film includes extensive, candid interviews with the women, pimps, clients, police, strip club and massage parlor managers and workers, police, and many accessories in the sex trade. The film also includes interviews with journalists, scholars, detectives and other knowledgeable individuals. The film emphasizes the way in which the internet has expanded the scope of sex work, both in terms of offering advertising for services and for allowing clients to form networks of their own to discuss their activities. The eight chapter headings shown for the film give a good idea of the contents:

1. Strip Clubs
2. Massage Parlors
3. The Street
4. Recruiting
5. Pimps
6. Clientele
7. Adult Films
8. At Risk

According to the film, Quebec is a large center for sex work catering both to locals and to people who visit sometimes with the explicit purpose of finding commercial sex. The movie is set in strip clubs,with their glittery, beckoning lights,  massage parlors, hotels, and on the street. The movie explores the desperate, exploited character of the women and the large sums of money that are made by pimps, gangs and the underworld at every level from the street girl to the expensive escort.

There is a lurid fascination to many of the scenes and settings. The film is effective, hard-hitting in tone and sharply critical of the sex work trade, which is portrayed without qualification  as exploitative, criminal, and as ruining the lives of both the women and the customers. Although thoughtful and well-done, ""The Sex Trade"" basically offers insights that are similar to those offered by other films documenting the sex industry and its participants and clients.  Still, this documentary will educate and appeal to viewers interested in the issue.  The film is distributed by First Run Features, which kindly sent me a review copy.

Total Time: 76 minutes
