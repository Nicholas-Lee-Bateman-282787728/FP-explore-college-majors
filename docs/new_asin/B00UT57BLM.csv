7071072,5,B00UT57BLM,"I bought this just for one movie, The Time of Their Lives, which is just as funny as I remembered.  I did watch one other which was very funny too.  The plots of these 1940's movies are silly and have holes one could drive a truck through but they are very very funny.  Much better for children today.",1509494400,5,301,4.155172413793103

8708242,5,B00UT57BLM,"The Best of Abbott and Costello, Volume 2

Bud Abbott and Lou Costello were the best comedy team in the movies of the 1940s and early 1950s. They were the best movie comedy team in 20th century America! There were other series of comic movies: Blondie and Dagwood, Hope and Crosby, Martin and Lewis. Aside from their physical differences, tall and thin versus short and stout (like Laurel and Hardy), their movies had a story that was relevant to society. The stories ranged over various geographic locations. Most of their films aged well. A movie is only as good as its story, so there are variations. The stories tell of the adventures of ordinary people and their interactions with society. [Was this why Jerry Seinfeld chose co-actors who were tall and thin, and short and stout?]

Some of their movies became part of the ""public domain"" and are not in this series. Perhaps someday we will see these collected on a new volume. One reason for their success is that movie audiences peaked during their time. There are no recurring comedy series today. Talent seems to have gone into TV shows since the 1950s. There were comedy TV shows in the 1950s that were also funny (Red Skelton, ""I Love Lucy"", ""The Honeymooners"", etc.), but few comedy shows since the 1960s. The corporate media prefers dramas that stress crime and punishment. Does this produce a fear that best sells products? This lists the eight films on two double-sided DVDs. You can find detailed descriptions of each movie elsewhere.

8708246,5,B00UT57BLM,"It is wonderful to have this as it includes my two favorite movies from this great Duo. ""The Time of Their Lives' was so wonderful to me when I was a child and my love for it has never waivered. I just had to have it and my joy in possessing it is indescribable. In his book, Leonard Maltin says this is the best of their movies and I'm glad to be supported by a good critic. The movie begins in 1780 during the Revolutionary War. Lou is a travelling tinker who wanders to raise money to buy the freedom of his love (an indentured servant to a man who, is a consort of Benedict Arnold). Marjorie Reynold, (""Holiday Inn"" and TV's, ""Life Of Riley""), the fianc of said traitor, overhears his plot against Washington. She and Lou set off to warm Washington, but are killed by a mistake in identity. Thinking they are traitors, the commander has their corpses thrown into  a well and curses them to be bound to the property, ""unless some evidence proves us wrong, with only one name to identify your rotting bones: traitors."" 1946: the two ghosts set out to prove they aren't traitors so they can go to their heavenly reward. This movie alone is worth the money",1526688000,,1156,4.376744186046512
8708247,4,B00UT57BLM,"I like ""The Time of Their Lives"" and ""Little Giant"" the best.

Lou Costello always makes me laugh but I especially enjoy the films in which he and Bud Abbott are not partners.",1522800000,,175,4.303030303030303
