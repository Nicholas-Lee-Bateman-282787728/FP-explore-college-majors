1398509,5,B000056N8C,"This film was good. I should say that it was a great aportunity for me to see this because Joanne Whalley(the mother),Sean Patrick Flanery(the stranger) has developed a very close friendship while the husband was in the war. I would recommend everyone to watch this film in order to spend some ""Emotionnally"" great time.",984787200,,320,4.944444444444445

I have, at times, stumbled across gems of movies that receive far too little credit. For some reason, they are brushed aside in the film world, to make way for some garbage or another.

I saw this movie several years ago, probably on T.V. It won me over with its warmth, setting, characters, and story. It's a sweet, family movie that only needs a bowl of popcorn, and maybe a tissue or two.

Joanne Whalley is a timeless, stunning woman who commands the attention of the audience in her roles. I first saw her in Willow, and was happy to see that she's just as talented and lovely years later in this subtle love story. Sean Patrick Flannery is as good-a-looking man as you'll ever want to see as the hero of this flick. If his looks alone don't win you over, his character will. And then there is Miss Alexa Vega-- ""Pug""--, the adorable, sassy daughter of Joanne Whalley's character. The atmosphere of this movie hangs in the air, trailing the onset of WWII with the foggy, tail end memories of the years during the Great Depression. And while it may not be the most mysterious, or pulse-racing film out there, it's a character driven story about the war-time home front that is more engaging and realistic than any car chaser with a weak storyline and weaker characterization.",1335657600,3,1394,4.480314960629921
1398511,5,B000056N8C,Outstanding performance by Sean Patrick Flanery. Set in the mid 1940's this tale of love moves one to tears. Letting go of the one you love. Doing the tight thing. Self sacrifice and moral integrity are at the core of this movie.,1311292800,4,229,4.476190476190476

1398513,5,B000056N8C,"I'm a big fan of movies that are simple in story, yet profound in emotion and meaning.  This is one of those movies.  Beautifully written and photographed, Run the Wild Fields is devoid, (happily so), of the extracurricular elements seen in a lot of movies today (usually at the expense of a substantial story)and focuses on the essence of the characters and the emotional simmering of the plot beneath the surface. It is a love story in general, but also dives into other sense of life elements that we can all relate to such as self-forgiveness, re-discovery of pride, productivity, purpose, and unrelenting hope.  The story reflects how love is a reflection of your values mirrored in someone else and how those connections could happen at any time in one's life.  All of the actors in this movie are strong and play their characters very believably.  Bravo!",1296518400,2,861,4.829931972789115

1398515,5,B000056N8C,"I loved this movie! I highly recommend it! It is about a little girl named Opal, and her mother Ruby, who had a very special man named Tom, that came into their life!

 Ruby's husband was a soldier in the war (WWII), and he had been missing in action for three years! Some people thought that he could be dead by now! But Ruby and Opal tried not to give up hope, that one day he'd would return!

 Tom came at a time ,when Ruby and Opal needed a man in their life to help them in so many wonderful ways!
Opal found Tom hurt in a field, and her and her mother helped care for him! Ruby noticed that he was a kind and thoughful man, so she let him stay and help her with the farm, but the town folk and Silas (a man who wanted Ruby), was very against Tom staying with Ruby and Opal. Lies and town rumors and gossip, and a jealous hate, caused trouble for Tom and Ruby and Opal! Especially for Ruby and Tom, because they where starting to fall in love with each other!

When a fire occurs at a town celebration, the town finds out what kind of man ,Tom really is! And things change when Opal receives an amazing letter from overseas! I loved this wonderful story!",1242518400,,1159,4.0881057268722465
1398516,4,B000056N8C,I usually come to Hallmark movies with high hopes but expectations that they'll be dashed. This is one Hallmark movie that I wanted to run out an buy once I saw. It's well-written and poetic. I would definitely recommend it.,1153440000,5,224,4.625
1398517,5,B000056N8C,"I finished watching this movie last night and I have to say it is an absolutely lovely film. The story line may have been attempted by other film makers...but Run the Wild Fields really is a winner. Exceptional portrayals by Joanne Walley, Sean Patrick Flanery and Alexa Vega.

Run the Wild Fields is set during WWII. Ruby Miller(Joanne Walley) and her daughter Pug(Alexa Vega)are awaiting the return of Frank(husband and father) from the Pacific battle front.

Three years go by and no word from Frank. Ruby and Pug's hopes for Frank's safe return, is all that have kept them going for three years. Then one day Pug happens across an injured and mysterious drifter named Tom Walker(Sean Patrick Flanery).

They help Tom recover from his wounds and in a series of events he ends up working on their farm.

Tom and Pug's relationship grows from Pug's insatiable curiosity about Tom's mysterious past...into a father daughter type of relationship. Also in the process Ruby and Tom form a wife and husband dynamic.

Throughout the movie, details of Tom's mysterious past gets leaked out.

Alas a letter from Frank arrives saying he is safe and on is way home. Beautiful and touching heart ache ensues...yet this movie leaves the viewer with a sense that every thing works out as it needs to.",1151798400,8,1288,4.831818181818182
1398518,5,B000056N8C,"This has got to be one of my favorite movies. It is a sweet tale of a family in the ww2 period. A lady name Ruby and her daughter, Opal. Ruby's husband has been missing in action for three years, when a man named Tom comes and startes to work for her and fix up the long out of repare farm. It is a great story.",1133654400,2,311,3.727272727272727
1398519,3,B000056N8C,"Run the Wild Fields is about a woman[Whalley] whose husband is gone, fighting in WWII, and has been missing in action for some time. She's bringing up her daughter by herself on the family farm, when a mysterious stranger shows up and enters their lives. This is a familiar premise, the drama set before us being: 1.what will we learn about the stranger, and 2. how will the stranger affect his hosts? And of course, in a typical Hollywood film, you expect lust-driven sparks to fly.

Yes, things do happen, but not what you might expect. Maybe this particular story is a useful corrective, in its own way, to Adrian Lyne-style melodramatic excesseses, of which you certainly can't accuse the makers of this picture. Still the kid [Alex Vega] is pretty good, in what could've been a treacly, insuffrably sweet role. The adults are ok too.

a slight revision 9/2005: I first reviewed this in 2004. I saw RTWF a 2nd time recently, and  it grows on you-- still no melodrama, but  Joanne Whalley and Sean Patrick Flanery are better as the romantic leads than I first allowed for. Both performances have a sort of antidramatic calm about them-- as if the characters simply ""are,"" and you have to go to them, watching perhaps a bit more intently for shadings and nuance than you might be accustomed to, participating in the unfolding of the narrative, as it were.

 I guess, over the years, I've grown accustomed to allowing for that sort of minimalism in Asian and European pictures, but not American ones.",1076457600,8,1501,4.709923664122138

7932275,4,B000056N8C,"This is a rich, thought-provoking movie, though it can be hard to keep track of the details (such as who knows what when).

The backbone of the movie may be found in the last two lines of the poem Pug is memorizing for school:  ""I could not love thee, Dear, so much / Loved I not honour more.""

Honor, for most of the people in the movie, is about the war and the men in the war.  They attend church, but they don't talk much about faithfulness, sin, and God's forgiveness.  Only Ruby reaches out to Tom.

The story turns around Opal ""Pug"" Miller, who is ten years old as the story begins.  An adult Pug looks back and acts as narrator, providing a framework for the story.  Pug and her mother Ruby are memorable characters, but the cream of the movie is the drifter Tom.  The shifting relationship between Ruby and Tom is fascinating.

[SPOILER:]  Tom is gentle, secretive, loveable, admirable, in need of home, and in need of forgiveness without seeing where to find it.

There are a number of symbols in the movie.  One works very well indeed, a few others much less; but that doesn't much matter.  What matters is Pug, and her mother, and Tom, and  honor.

The reality of life's temptations and the integrity to do the right thing regardless of how excusable you could make it!
