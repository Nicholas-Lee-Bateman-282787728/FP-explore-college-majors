As a Greek-American I am constantly practice my Greek language skills through Greek movies. This movie had English subtitles and seemed like a likely candidate to add to my vocabulary. Ive seen quite a few Greeks movies of various qualities. This is truly one of the most compelling, atmospheric and engrossing movies  Greek or otherwise   Ive ever seen.

This is a psychological character study of the main protagonist, Stratos. Stratos has just recently been released from jail and works at a bakery. He is, in a word, a completely changed, but  broken man. Wanting to leave his life of crime, but not quite knowing how, he continually works as a contract killer to finance the escape of his friend from jail, only to learn he has been used and taken advantage of all down the line.

While in a lesser movie this last paragraph might be considered a spoiler, this is not the case here. The true enjoyment of this film is watching the high quality of their acting of the cast in their portrayal of its characters. The emphasis in this movie is given to character development. Vangelis Mourikis is perfect at personifying Stratos lost soul. Under the expert direction of Yiannis Economides, the desperation of Stratoss soul is captured on film without becoming maudlin or exaggerated, and he conveys that bleakness in sweeping, yet gorgeous, panoramas of Greek countryside and urban landscapes.

It is the best type of movie you will want to see. The plot and characters are not just explained to you. Instead, it requires you to carefully pay attention to what is said, how the characters react, and how the story develops. Packed with innuendo and shadows, Stratos, To Micro Psari, combines craft of a movie made in the 70s with the foreboding of a film noir movie from the 50s.

Oh, and as to the language in the movie, it is a treasure trove of Greek slang. Stratos is full of the street slang as it is spoken on the street. It is extremely salty, earthy language, but language one hears everyday.

You must see this movie. You will not be disappointed.",1488240000,,2168,4.699208443271768
8698502,5,B00SJ9VCTM,"Don't let the ugly poster of ""The Small Fish"" (aka ""Stratos"") fool you. It is an intense and dramatic portrait of contemporary Greece, seen through the eyes of Stratos, a contract killer who works during the day in a bakery, where he silently and passively witnesses the exploitation of workers. His life though acquires another meaning when he is behind his car wheel, with a gun in his pocket and a mission to accomplish. But do not think that the movie is executed in correpondence with the dramatic intensity of his criminal life. Not that ""The Little Fish"" is a bland film either. The point is that director Yannis Economides opted to tell the story from the other side of Stratos' personality. It is really a problem for Stratos, that he has a very soft heart: he is giving all his money to Yorgos, the brother of a guy called Leonidas, who once saved his life, so that Yorgos can execute a plan to free Leonidas from a maximum security prison; and Stratos also sees after a family that lives across his apartment building, that includes a dying grandfather, a little daughter, a disabled father and a very young prostitute mother -who in fact could be the little girl's sister, but who knows... everything about Stratos' concerns is dark or faint, while those who surround him are screaming, bullying or abusing everybody. He has a violent past and after many years in jail two mob factions want his services. This is just an idea of the plot elements but there are more, and it takes 133 minutes to reach a fine resolution. Without pointing out the national crisis, unemployment, breaking of moral codes, or unethical actions, ""The Small Fish"" gives a rich panorama of what a great empire as Greece has become in the 21st century, which should also serve as a warning to the empire of the day and its citizens. And yes, the Greek title ""To mikro sari"" (that is, the small fish) refers to the popular saying, ""Big fish eat small fish"".",1429401600,2,1942,4.631884057971014
