2593334,2,B000FZETUM,"This DVD was just OK.  I have been attending yoga classes for the last 6 months and wanted something short to do at home and thought this might fit the bill.  The biggest flaw is that they don't name the positions.  If you are in ""cobra"" say you are in ""cobra"" so a beginner can associate the position with the name.  A beginner going from this DVD to a class might have a hard time because they wouldn't know the names of the positions.  Also they spent an awful lot of time in the ""downward dog"" position for my taste and the flow from one position to the next was awkward at times.  You were constantly watching the TV rather than relaxing into the poses.  Music wasn't very relaxing either.  I think I am going have to pass on this one.",1201132800,16,740,4.198581560283688
2593335,2,B000FZETUM,the music alone is a reason to turn off this dvd before it even begins. if you are looking for power yoga- stick to rodney yee. this would probably be ok for a beginner- if you could mute it.,1198972800,2,191,3.923076923076923
2593336,3,B000FZETUM,"I absolutely love all of The Firm workout videos, so I ordered The Firm: Power Yoga.  However, I'm not that impressed.  It's not a bad video, but some of the moves were a bit awkward and I didn't really feel like I got a good workout.  The instructor does not use regular yoga terms to describe the moves (like ""downward dog""), so you just have to watch her to see what she is doing.  Although I am not a Yoga guru, I have a couple of yoga DVDs and have gone to several classes to supplement by mostly cardio & weights workouts.  My favorite yoga DVDs so far are the Rodney Yee Power Yoga series, but I am always looking for something even better.",1173484800,9,647,4.185483870967742
2593337,5,B000FZETUM,I LIKE THIS DVD A LOT.IT IS 35 MINUTES LONG AND YOU GET A GOOD WORKOUT IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME.THEY USE YOGA MOVES BUT IT DOES SEEM MORE LIKE AN EXCERCISE TAPE.,1168473600,2,162,3.7941176470588234
2593358,5,B000FZETUM,"Great yoga workout! She explains the moves well and takes it at a workable pace. I don't like feeling like I am doing aerobics during a yoga workout. This power yoga doesn't leave me out of breath, but it does have me sore and feeling it the next day. Good buy that will definitely be used for years to come.",1426291200,2,308,4.15
2593359,2,B000FZETUM,"Poor cueing, vague instruction.  No improvement over doing it by yourself.",1425340800,,74,5.7272727272727275
2593360,5,B000FZETUM,Great workout that I've enjoyed for years! I had this on VHS & then transferred to my computer. But still wanted the DVD as well & it has everything that the original does. I highly recommend this workout to anyone!,1421020800,,215,4.4
2593361,5,B000FZETUM,The One!  Only 30 min & i feel relaxed & rejuvenating after a tough day!,1413072000,,72,3.8
2593362,4,B000FZETUM,"I have to agree with some of the reviews, the lack of yoga terms, and ""yogi"" approach is what I love about this DVD. The stretches are great for my post jog mornings, or even on a rest day when I want something to keep me active but not a full blown workout. It took sometime to know the routine, but now I automatically flow into it without looking at the TV. I'm not a yoga person. I've tried, but that bandwagon I just could never really jump on. This video improves my flexibility, is a great stretch post jog, and is short enough that I don't feel overwhelmed when I'm done. I really like it. It's a happy medium for those of us who want yoga flexibility workouts but not really into, nor want to be into yoga.",1410912000,,715,4.151079136690647
2593363,5,B000FZETUM,I love it. I happened to try this at a friends house and liked the format and instructor. I went to Amazon and located one to purchase for myself and am enjoying following it immensely.,1409788800,,185,4.314285714285714
2593364,4,B000FZETUM,"I like the fact that it's exercise using Yoga moves. I don't like the Yoga as a religion mentality, just not for me. I am over 50 and love this DVD for stretching and balance. It is a tape that should be used as an addition to your exercise routine (she states that in the beginning of the tape!). I am ordering a new one since the one I bought over 4 years ago is beat!",1408320000,,370,3.8815789473684212
2593365,5,B000FZETUM,I have used this DVD for myself for years!  It's wonderful!  It's only an half hour and it's very effective.  I buy this for gifts.  I have given at least 10 for gifts.,1389139200,,168,4.0
2593366,3,B000FZETUM,Not bad but not exceptional.  Video is too short in my opinion for a serious yoga workout but is good for non-cardio days when one has a different focus/goal.  Most positions were not advanced and modifications are shown briefly so this could appeal to many fitness or experience levels.  I was expecting a bit more from the Firm series...,1384819200,,339,4.711864406779661
2593367,5,B000FZETUM,"The Firm has been the best since back in the 80's and the hits keep coming. I love all types of yoga and have about 10 favorite DVDs, each with its own special appeal, but in 35 min. The Firm gives us yoga that's aerobic too. Perfect for me and I was fluent in the  routine by the third time I used it. Some reviews touted that it has no ""mystical"" aspect and doesn't use the standard names for positions. It was kind of fun and different to have a serious yoga routine that doesn't have the jargon, altho it's a first for me..",1366502400,,527,4.0673076923076925
2593382,5,B000FZETUM,Great video just what I was looking for I like all the Firm videos tho I'd like another one for my daughter,1366156800,,107,3.909090909090909
2593383,3,B000FZETUM,"If you're looking for energizing yoga, this is it. Its not exactly the calm relaxing type. You can do it on your off days from regular work outs and still feel you got a work out in. You don't have to be an experienced yoga student, its easy for beginners.",1362528000,,256,4.14
2593384,3,B000FZETUM,"For me, this is a good routine because I am new at Yoga and I was looking for something relaxing but with certain level of demand. Like all The Firm routines, this is a good one!!.",1361923200,,180,4.027777777777778
2593385,4,B000FZETUM,"I really enjoy this yoga workout when I am short on time.  It has a nice progression of poses for the beginner to intermediate level.  I do not like the instructor, her voice can get a little annoying.  Only other negative is that they do not use the terms for the yoga poses, but the instructor just explains how to get in and out of them.  This can be a little distracting.  Overall great to do in a small living room when you only have a half an hour to do yoga.",1359936000,,465,4.010869565217392
2593386,5,B000FZETUM,Love this yoga dvd my mom had it and wouldn't let me have it when i got married and moved and i have been on the hunt everywhere and ding ding! Duh! check amazon and whah la! i found it!! Love it,1358812800,,195,3.6666666666666665
2593387,1,B000FZETUM,Half as good as the original Firm tapes. Gaian is a huge horrible corporation and I do not recommend anything by them,1353974400,,117,4.363636363636363
2593388,4,B000FZETUM,I really loved this dvd when i first started doing yoga. It is a very good dvd for a beginner and it does relax you alot. I would only use this dvd to help me relieve stress in my muscle and clear my mind. at the ending of it all i feel refreshed and calm.,1343001600,,256,3.672727272727273
2593389,5,B000FZETUM,My yoga video came to me quickly. It is in excellent shape. I am extremely happy with my purchase. Best yoga video I've tried so far.,1324425600,,133,4.153846153846154
2593390,4,B000FZETUM,"This was my first yoga video. I've worked out with several different yoga dvds since first buying this one a long time ago. I recommend it for anyone who is interested in yoga. This dvd is good for beginners because it has modified versions of the more challenging poses. It's also good for any advanced ""yogini"". For 30 minutes, you get a quick workout that stretches and strengthens while flowing through poses at a pretty steady and moderate pace. The names of the poses are not a focus in this video, but a beginner should focus more on getting into the poses correctly than what they are called anyway, right? Check it out. :) I also love yoga videos by Gaiam and Crunch, who have pilates workout videos as well.",1313193600,,717,4.523076923076923
2593391,3,B000FZETUM,"I bought this video a couple of years ago and thought it was a pretty good video when I was new to yoga. However, now that I have been taking Fitness Yoga classes at my local YMCA I have definately realized there is a lot lacking from this video.

I liked the instructor and the flow of the workout, but I really wish she would have used actual yoga terms so I didn't have to watch the TV for the entire workout. I think the moves that are used in the video are pretty basic yoga moves and would be good for someone who is in a pinch and needs a workout but doesn't have time to go to a real class.

The intensity of this video is really going to vary based on your experience. I remember it being pretty difficult when I was brand new to yoga. Now, I would say even with the more challenging options it is probably a mild to moderate (only in some parts) workout.

I've actually only began practicing yoga on a regular basis for about a month or two- taking two to three classes per week- and I feel like I have graduated from this video and will probably only use it when I am short on time or when I want a lower intensity practice.

I would recommend this video to beginners who want to supplement their studio or gym yoga practice. I think it is important for all beginners to take a real yoga class so that you have the oportunity to ask questions, and get help from the instructor.",1309910400,2,1388,4.12962962962963
2593415,3,B000FZETUM,"Its an ok yoga video, only 30mins long so that is kind of nice if you are in a hurry. I personally didn't find it challenging enough, I'm in pretty good shape but by no means a fanatic or fitness buff. The only time I really like to do this video is after I run for some good stretching. There are also a few parts that are hard to follow and don't flow well and she never uses the names of the poses so you have to stop and look at the screen more than i would like.",1298160000,3,467,3.7755102040816326
2593416,5,B000FZETUM,"This is a very enjoyable yoga workout. Just like the people of the FIRM know how to do it, this DVD is great, and to the point.
If you want results in fitness and resistance, GO FOR IT!",1294704000,,185,3.8947368421052633
2593417,2,B000FZETUM,"I love the Firm series and I love doing yoga. I thought this video would be a perfect fit. Nope. She doesn't use pose names, which in unhelpful and it felt a bit cheesy. Plus, I didn't feel like I got a workout or stretched out. I would try other Firm workouts because they are great! For a good yoga video try, The Biggest Loser: Weight Loss Yoga, with Bob.",1294099200,2,358,4.128571428571429
2593418,4,B000FZETUM,"I really hate yoga, but I'm a FIRM BELIEVER, so I gave this a try. I wanted a stretching workout for my rest days. The reviews were split between people that like yoga but hate this video or people that hate yoga but love this video. That was reason enough for me to give it a try.

The thing I don't like about yoga is all the talk about ""finding your center"" and the insanely weird names for the poses. I get bored and irritated long before I feel the benefits of the stretches.

This video was different from any yoga that I had tried before, and I really enjoyed it! I didn't have to listen to a bunch of ""mind and spirit"" crap, and I found the pace to be easy to follow. The instructor takes you from beginner to more advanced, instead of the other way around. She calls the poses names that make sense instead of weird animal or object names.

I think that this is a great video for people that don't like all the yoga mumbo jumbo, but they want to experience the deep, cleansing stretches that this workout provides.",1291248000,,1023,4.235897435897436
2593419,4,B000FZETUM,"I have just added Yoga to my daily routine.  this is a not so time consuming workout 30 mnutes.
the first time i tried this i had been waterskiing a couple days and my lower back was like mush.  i thought i was done skiing for the week.  I tried this yoga routine and low and behold my back felt great.  i was sold on yoga.",1285372800,,323,3.8484848484848486
2593420,4,B000FZETUM,This yoga workout is both relaxing and challenging.  My only criticism is that they do not name the poses.  The flow of poses is smooth and she does a good job at describing how your form should look.,1276041600,,200,4.2368421052631575
2593421,2,B000FZETUM,"I'm not sure what inspired Ms. Strohecker to make this DVD. I don't consider myself a yoga guru but I know enough and I think I could do a better job leading a yoga session! I've been a long-time FIRM DVD user (since 1997) but this FIRM's DVD just doesn't cut it. Kristen's flexibility is minimal. Her queue is off, her flow is awkward and her posture is poor. I don't know what the FIRM was thinking allowing her to do this yoga DVD! (Then again, they have had some pretty bad cardio + weight instructors too!) For ""Power Yoga"" your heart rate should go up and you should start to sweat after just 10-15 minutes of doing it. This DVD lasts about 35 minutes and I didn't break any sweat after doing it. So if you're a beginner and think oh, great, it'll be perfect for me. Not so fast! You would learn nothing about yoga from this DVD because the instructor doesn't name any of the poses! You will not know what a Cobra, a Child or a Downward Facing Dog pose is. She tells you nothing! To me, this just shows that she has absolutely no respect for the founding yogis who have made yoga what it is. It seems as though she wanted to create a new ""break-through workout"" of her own. If so, she shouldn't have associated the word ""yoga"" with ther DVD. She should have just named her DVD ""my own made-up workout"", something like that. Don't buy this DVD.",1271376000,6,1349,4.2734375
2593422,2,B000FZETUM,"I did not like this workout. It was very simple and I think the hardest move in it was a deep lunge. After 40 minutes I did not even break a sweat or have a single sip of my water.

It also moved very fast so you never really felt your muscles stretch or burn from holding the position. Also, it was filled with somewhat cheesy workout expressions like: ""c'mon, you can do it!"" and ""look how hard you've worked!!"" Which I find annoying.

Lastly -- it was based around yoga moves, such as downward dogs and lunges, but it did  not have any of the yoga mentality. If you are looking for peace and calmness of mind (which yoga often brings) along with a good workout, I'd suggest looking elsewhere.  If you are looking for a quick, low impact workout and you aren't flexible or muscular (and maybe have bad joints) then you might like this DVD.",1271116800,2,841,4.30379746835443
2593423,2,B000FZETUM,"I decided not to renew my gym membership and asked for some Yoga DVDs for Christmas and received this one.  I expected more from the ""The Firm"" group.  It's just so-so.

The video does offer beginner and more experienced variations to a lot of the poses.  I do mostly the experienced ones, but for some poses the beginner ones are challenging enough.  One of the ladies on the video shows the beginner move while the other 4 do the experienced one.  But if you were trying to follow the beginner version, they don't show the beginner lady near enough.  And I've noticed the background participants (fellow Firm ""master instructors"") sometimes goof up.  Which I totally don't understand with editting.  There are multiple cameras - show someone else at that moment.

The total workout it about 30 minutes.  But before you get to that, you have to go through 2:30 min of junk (intro-stuff).  That's fine the first time, but I don't need to hear it over and over.  There are no chapters, so you can't just fast forward to the next segment to get to the actual workout.  That's annoying.  Then there's the instructor - I think she's kinda annoying.  And as another reviewer mentioned, they don't use any yoga names for the moves (downward dog, child's pose, warrior 1).

So... it's good with stretching and it's short.  It's worthwhile to do on an ""easy"" day or in the morning before work, but disappointing in the production (camera shots, music, DVD chapters) and isn't a ""power"" workout as they claim.  Therefore, my ""so-so"" rating.  I'll continue doing this video, but if I had rented it from the library first, I wouldn't have bought it.",1262736000,,1638,4.700704225352113
2593424,4,B000FZETUM,"I like to use this workout in combination with a more difficult video (e.g. an hour of cardio then this). Its not long enoug to be a full workout but it definitely stretches each muscle and you can get some good ab toning in as well. I workout hard most days and my joints always feel better after this video. Having said that, its definitely not enough of a workout on its own, the firm should have combined it with a cardio sculpt to make a double set. Otherwise, the instructor does a good of explaining form but I wish she had used yoga terms.",1258934400,,547,4.219047619047619
2593470,4,B000FZETUM,"Being new to Yoga and exercizing late inlife - this video is great for beginners; however, the camera focuses on the advanced and intermediate views more than the beginner mode....that's my only complaint.",1249862400,,205,5.242424242424242
2593471,3,B000FZETUM,Interesting sequence of poses to shake up my routine. Good music too but too short and not challenging enough to get a great workout. The girl's loud voice constantly talking does nothing to promote relaxation either. I'll use it for doing right before bed on days I do a harder workout earlier in the day. I did not even sweat and I don't feel as relaxed as say with Shiva Rhea's Yoga Shakti. If you're in a hurry or a beginner this might work or like I said if you did a strenuous workout in the afternoon and need to loosen up. It's just OKAY. I could make a better dvd.,1239667200,,573,4.171171171171171
2593472,5,B000FZETUM,"As a stay at home Mom, I love this 30 minute yoga video. On days that I can't squeeze in an outdoor workout, this is a great alternative. Sure, it's probably not as extreme as other Power Yoga videos and it may not contain all of the proper yoga terms, but for me, it serves its purpose. At the end, I feel more stretched and more relaxed. And as a runner, I notice that it has definitely improved my strength and enhanced my running workouts. I was originally taking this video out of the library and continually renewing it. I'm very thankful that I now own it.",1233964800,,563,4.271028037383178
2593473,5,B000FZETUM,"I consider myself to be in pretty good shape, but I had never tried yoga before.  On the reccomendation of a friend I ordered this DVD.  I really love it.

Being new to yoga I knew nothing about any poses, how to get into them or out of them.  The instructor in this dvd walks you through every single pose as you are doing it.  I could close my eyes and get into every position just by following the instructor's voice.  Having done a few other yoga dvd's now, I really appreciated how this one all flows together.  Each pose flows into the next pose with a shift of weight and/turn of the body.  You also get the beginners pose BEFORE the instructor moves into the more difficult position.  This is different from every other dvd I have done where the instructor moves into the more difficult pose and then after a few seconds says something like ""if this position is too challenging then try this"" .. I learned modifications on this dvd that i have been able to apply to other dvds.

I am not sure what ""power"" yoga is supposed to be.  I can tell you that this dvd is a full body work out.  If you aren't feeling it then you aren't stretching yourself into the poses.  I do agree with other posters though, this really a stretching yoga dvd.  The poses are not difficult, they are effective.  I really feel wonderful after doing this dvd and I use it at least once a week in combination with other yoga dvd's that I have.  This one leaves me feeling limber, warm and refreshed.

That being said, if you are looking for a dvd with advanced poses and a high difficulty level, this is not the dvd for you.  If you are a beginner, this is the perfect dvd for you.",1223251200,29,1662,4.255591054313099
2593474,5,B000FZETUM,"It's been almost 15 years since I exercised regularly, and when I first tried yoga, finally trying to get into shape, I was bored by the slow pace but couldn't keep up with other cardio videos. With yoga, I felt like was breathing awkwardly and that I wasn't getting a workout at all.

But after experiencing years of chronic back pain with no relief despite physical therapy, heavy prescription drugs, and thousands of dollars in chiropractic visits, I was driven to try yoga again.

It was this video that got me hooked. When I concentrated on my stretches and following the techniques Kirsten (yoga master in this video) suggests, I was amazed by the almost immediate effect I felt. After just two workouts, my lower back pain lessened, and I began to feel more limber. My muscles began to tone up, and my body seemed to come alive. I could feel bones, tendons, and muscles that had been dormant for years!

Although I still have pain from time to time in my sacrum, this video has helped me feel better than I have in years! It is awesome!",1218931200,3,1043,4.537234042553192

It was actually pretty good for a beginner....but I do have to say, I probably wouldnt categorize it as power yoga. I did get a great workout with it. It gives you options for beginners, and then harder moves so you set your standards. I do have to say, there is a little too much talking in it but its only 34 minutes and it flys by. They constantly keep you moving into different positions. I would definitely give it a try if you are into yoga as an option, especially if you're new to yoga in general.",1207440000,2,604,4.127118644067797

I actually like the fact that the moderator talks you through the poses rather than simply calling them by their formal title. I take a hot yoga class and they do the same. If you're looking for a 30 minute stretch and relaxation to work your form, I would highly recommend this DVD as a great tool.

The improvement I've notice the first week on my back was unreal the flexibility and the balance in just 2 week after I started has improved and is improving even more. This is a simple well explain and only 35 min dvd.,1446249600,,398,4.025316455696203
