5256563,5,B0093U6XVI,"Lots of information for tying Tenkara Flies both classic and contemporary. Tips on materials needed, hooks and how to fish the flies. Also shows underwater examples of each fly and it's action.",1362268800,2,193,5.0625
5256564,5,B0093U6XVI,"This was a great instructional video for the Japanese tenkara flies!  Istructions are clear, sound is good, and camera quality was excellent!  A nice addition is the examples of how they move in the water.",1360972800,2,205,4.828571428571428
8535413,4,B0093U6XVI,"It's a decent video. Picture was clear and the instruction was pretty good. I'll admit I expected a bit more variety on flies. Mostly it's just slight variations of the same basic pattern, or even the same pattern tied by different people just to show personal differences. Most of the flies shown are also available on Youtube videos or in tutorials on Chris Stewart's page, so there was not a lot of 'new' content for me. If a Volume 2 is ever made, I'd like to see more varieties of the flies used in Japan. As Daniel stated in the beginning of the video, many of Japan's master anglers' flies are like business cards in their uniqueness, such that they are easily recognizable. I'd like to see more examples of them than just Ishigaki and Amano.

The in-water video of the flies could have been a bit better. None of them actually showed the flies' characteristic 'pulsating' hackles, just drifting along in a slow current (or maybe it was an aquarium). A couple in-water examples had hackles stuck in the barb, or the line attached to the eye off-center which was a bit off-putting as well.",1419033600,,1095,4.586734693877551
8535414,5,B0093U6XVI,"Fantastic video, very well done, great explanations and video. It really explains a lot and shows step by step how to make the different Tenkara flies. I am extremely happy with this video. I was able to make flies right along with the video",1412035200,,241,4.5
8535415,5,B0093U6XVI,Quality video. Very good instruction on tying Tenkara Flies.,1410307200,,60,5.777777777777778
8535416,5,B0093U6XVI,New concept in fly tying. I personally got alot out of it. Shows several different styles to a basic concept. Having several different tyers showing their personal favorite was a great angle to the DVD instructional style. I tied a few of the flies shown in the video and took them to me local lake and they work just a well if not better than other flies I spend 3 times as long tying and the Tankara flies are sooo simple to tie. Feather and thread and some peacock hearl on a couple just to break things up a bit all worked great. Another plus is that when you snag one and lose it your really not to heart broken. Very good DVD. I will be giving this out as Christmas presents to a few good fishing buddies that tie their own flies as well.,1405382400,2,744,4.137931034482759
8535417,5,B0093U6XVI,Like this book a lot.  I bought a Tenkara rod and now tying flies.,1405123200,,66,3.7142857142857144
8535418,5,B0093U6XVI,For a beginner I wish I had this before buying equipment/supplies.  Easy to follow step by step instructions that allowed me to tie good looking flies.,1397088000,,151,4.8076923076923075
8535419,5,B0093U6XVI,"Simple, concise, and well put together. I have tied and fished with these patterns and enjoy them. Easy to tie and effective.",1385683200,,125,4.7272727272727275
8535420,5,B0093U6XVI,I thought this dvd was really well put together. I watched it a number of times. There is one bad review saying it's the same fly tied over and over. That's what tenkara is all about it takes all the nonsense out of fly fishing you don't need to waste time tying hundreds of flies and stacks of materials. Every fly you'll ever need and material is on this dvd. A breathe of fresh air.,1382486400,2,385,4.1466666666666665
8535421,5,B0093U6XVI,"I have seen a lot of You Tube videos and for-sale fly tying videos, but never one as clearly and concisely presented as this one. Several fly tying experts show how to tie the same patterns so you can choose whichever ""style"" you feel most comfortable with. Yes, these are tenkara patterns, but they are simple & effective patterns for any style of fly fishing. This is especially great for beginning fly tyers. A+++ video!",1366156800,5,423,4.653333333333333
8535422,1,B0093U6XVI,This is a waste of time and money. It shows one fly tyed multiple times with different materials. I wanted something but got a simple fly tyed over and over. If you tye more than once a year you will be let down. I learned nothing and if you spend just a little time on your skills neither will you.,1364774400,,299,4.0
