2111377,2,B0002OXUPG,"I have used other body ball dvd's and this one is really to boring compared to all of them. If you give it time, the workouts do test you a little bit, but thats if you don't fall asleep first! But if your the calm type that dosent like to much of action in a workout then get this dvd. Its soothing for that matter.",1137974400,9,316,3.876923076923077
2111378,1,B0002OXUPG,"I love Gaiam products. I especailly love working out on my balance ball. What I don't like is this video. I can't watch more than 5 minutes of it, it's far too boring and doesn't even catch my interests, let alone keep them. I don't feel worked out after I do suffer through the entire thing. Do yourself a favor, use the money you were going to spend on this video and buy the Balance Ball for Beginners. It's slighty more interesting and you will feel like you've worked out the next day.",1119312000,28,490,4.279569892473118
2111379,2,B0002OXUPG,"I love my new stability ball and I love to exercise. I do not, however, love this DVD. I tolerate it and that's about it!

The best aspect of the DVD is that it is easy to navigate. There is an introduction, a section of fundamentals, and three pilates-based exercise routines (warm-up, core, upper body). I do like that you can select the sections you want to do in order to create your own workout.

I like to be lead through instruction. That way it feels like you are in an exercise class and is more ""personal"". In this video, the instructor used voice-over after the fact to give the instructions. I just find it a bit eery to watch an stone-faced instructor while a disembodied voice tells me to inhale and exhale!

I also find the title a bit misleading. I don't think you would lose a lot of weight doing this video alone as it is toning and not cardio at all. It also has a bit of a ""New Age"" vibe to it, which is a turn-off to me.

If you are a beginning exerciser and the above problems don't both you, this DVD may be appropriate for you.",1104710400,54,1051,4.188118811881188
2111380,5,B0002OXUPG,"This is a fun workout! The best part is you can choose several different short 10-15 min. routines and put them in any order through the menu interface! Wow, what a lovely way to do it. You choose the sequence. It's not choppy like some of the other DVD's I've tried with this function.

I love ball workouts. I'm not a big lover of pilates, but this one is great! Most of it is fairly easy, but you make it what you will like any exersize routines. Some of her bridge poses are a bit difficult, so it does have some challenges.

Well worth the money if you're looking for a good balance ball routine. Check my other reviews on ball DVD's, yoga, mediation, etc.",1097020800,66,661,4.28

2111386,4,B0002OXUPG,"I was a little surprised that it was an instructional video, but it was very easy to understand. Each section contains workouts that are challenging yet easy for someone to do. The video's music is a little slow and some parts are a little dry and boring but all in all this is a good video for someone just learning to use the balance ball.",1397174400,2,341,4.2615384615384615
2111387,1,B0002OXUPG,Do not like this video.  It's out of date and very slow.  Suzanne Deason's movements are robotic and her verbal prompts are whispery and annoying.  I didn't feel like I got a good workout at all.,1396483200,,195,4.361111111111111
2111388,4,B0002OXUPG,This exercise really hits several spots. The DVD is divided into 3 sections and you can select which section you would like to work on . Each exercise flows smoothly and it feels like you are quickly done.,1390089600,,205,4.421052631578948
2111389,5,B0002OXUPG,I really enjoy this workout. It works your core and total body and most the moves can be done by beginners. A good workout.,1381708800,3,123,4.166666666666667
2111390,5,B0002OXUPG,"I had used this workout in the past but had given it away, so I needed to buy another one for myself. This is a more advanced workout than the ""Balance Ball for Beginners"", it is also very good, but something that you definitely have to work up too.",1373414400,3,249,4.1020408163265305

2111392,3,B0002OXUPG,"I am not certain this is rigorous enough for me.  It is very slowly paced but thorough. I would recommend it as a great workout for someone new to exercise, recovering from an injury, or even seniors. It is an excellent video, focused on proper technique and flow.  Its just not a great workout for someone that is on a rigorous workout plan, unless you are using this as a recovery day workout.  It certainly won't provide a lot of weight loss benefits for someone who works out at a moderate to high intensity level.",1355702400,2,518,4.431578947368421
2111393,5,B0002OXUPG,"I have trouble with tension and migraine headaches. This video has helped me to relax while building my core and upper body muscles, helping to alleviate some of the pain.",1355011200,,171,4.733333333333333
2111394,4,B0002OXUPG,"This video is excellent, but if you're a beginner, it may be tough.  I am an overweight runner with a foot injury, so I thought strengthening my core would help.  I love Suzanne Deason's Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss video, so I thought she'd be great for my first balance ball video.

She did not disappoint when it comes to her soothing voice.  Her cues in this video were a bit more awkward, though.  Although accurate, the 'inhale, move, exhale, inhale, exhale, move, inhale,"" cues came flooding at me so fast at times, I really felt overwhelmed to try to keep up.  That said, I'm sure if I did this video regularly, I'd have an easier time following, and a much stronger, leaner body.

The main problem I had with this video was the difficulty level.  My core is very weak, which is part of how I injured my foot.  Because it's so weak, many of the moves (especially in Section Two) were impossible for me to do with correct form (I found myself straining my neck even though I was trying not to).  Generally, when doing an exercise video, once I have to ""sit out"" on a couple moves, I feel frustrated and defeated, so I quit.  She said to just sit out on the moves you can't do, but I think this video would have been better for beginners or overweight people if there were some modifications shown.  In the yoga video I mentioned before, there were 3 versions of each exercise shown, and without those modifications, I would not have been able to do the moves with correct form.  This video falls short of that expectation, with only Suzanne Deason performing the exercises; there was no one there with her.

The production values are high, so it's tolerable, but this video is filmed inside, which is a bit of a negative for me as well.

There is an intro section where Suzanne speaks about the Pilates theory, which influenced the routines in the video.  Then, even though all the sections work your core, they do so by focusing on different body parts, with 4 sections of workouts:
1) Fundamentals of Pilates and Balance Ball Work
2) Core Warm-up
3) Lower Body (Legs, Hips, Butt, and Thighs)
4) Upper Body (Arms, Chest, and Back)

Pros:
1) Quality instructor, soothing voice
2) Quality moves
3) Can customize workout by choosing which sections and in what order
4) Great production values

Cons:
1) Cues are fast and tough to follow
2) Difficult moves, no modifications shown
3) Indoor scenery",1325462400,18,2407,4.571095571095571
2111395,5,B0002OXUPG,"TERRIFIC! Best dvd for a workout I have ever purchased. I bought this after my 2nd baby was born years ago and I used it for several months, and it helped me tone up without feeling overexerted- and every single time I did it I'd finish feeling wonderful. My body felt more alive, not drained, and it's all set to a very relaxing pace and mellow, zen-like music. It's a gentle, yet effective, workout. Added with some good long walks or hikes 1-2 times/wk and I lost weight easily, plus I love how it lengthened my muscles, and strengthened and toned my core. I have just started using it again after the long winter, I wished I'd rediscovered it months ago- I already feel better, after 1 workout! I LOVE THIS DVD.",1300665600,3,715,4.424242424242424
2111396,3,B0002OXUPG,It's a good tape...just very basic. The moves are all explained very well and you feel very relaxed when you are done. I would say this tape is for a beginner who has not exercised for 20+ years like I have. I did the tape once and do not feel compelled to do it again..yet. It will stay in my collection for light days:),1289865600,,321,4.03125
2111397,3,B0002OXUPG,I have just started to use this DVD and have found it very easy to use and follow.  Great DVD for those people that want to use an exercise ball at home.,1287360000,,153,3.78125
2111398,5,B0002OXUPG,This is such an awesome ab video!!  Not all the exercises are geared for your abs however because you need to use your abs to stay balanced all the exercises work them.  This is the only video i've found that i really see a difference and my husband sees the difference too so its not just wishful thinking on my part.,1287187200,,318,4.19672131147541
2111399,5,B0002OXUPG,"I've never worked on a balanceball before, so thought I'd pick this dvd up.  I have to be real careful to not use wts, as I have chronic myofascial pain, I also have fibro, for anyone considering if they should try this or not.  I really love it!  I stretch as much, or sometimes NOt as much as I can, whatever suits me at that time.  I always feel so good about myself and my  balance after doing this workout.  I know that out of all my video's, this is my favorite.  It's 50 min, which if someone told me that, I wouldn't even bother, but it's very relaxed and slow stretches.  At this time and point, I think this is the best exercise for me. Kathy Smith was my all time favorite and 'The Firm', but I can no longer do those anymore,.  I no longer feel that I'm 'missing out' of my workouts, this one is great and I can actually keep up with it!  I hope you try this, it may be the best for you too.  Thank-you Suzanne for helping me to feel good again.",1273104000,15,957,4.01058201058201
2111400,5,B0002OXUPG,"I have to laugh when people say this isn't a good workout-CLEARLY YOU ARE NOT ENGAGING YOUR MUSCLES PROPERLY!!!!  Anytime anyone says ""a workout is too easy"", it is usually because they are doing it incorrectly. I've been an avid excerciser in many disciplines for over 20 years and am definitely lean and fit.  This one leaves me feeling ""worked out""-kind of like how you feel after swimming a bunch of laps after not having swam for a while. I could see if you didn't keep your hips high when leaning back on the ball, or lose your focus on tightening all of your muscles and really reaching, this could seem pointless. A good understanding of pilates principles is important in order to get the most out of this workout. In a nutshell-totally worth it if you want long sculpted muscles and good flexibility, and it's a decent calorie burner too if the effort is truly there.",1268697600,19,877,4.579617834394904
2111401,5,B0002OXUPG,"I like how you can pick what parts of the body you want to workout. Very easy exercise, but at the same time very effective. I love Suzanne. She's my favorite instructor as far as exercise DVDs goes. I try to do her Pilates conditioning for weight loss every day, but if I am running late and want a shorter workout, I do this one.",1246060800,2,331,4.107692307692307
2111402,4,B0002OXUPG,"I tried this out yesterday.  I was surprised that it really is a Pilates workout on the ball.  Susan's cuing is excellent, the breathing is very important and you first have to get the hang of it, and I think the workout will be even more effective once you have the breathing down pat.  Its not an exciting video, but if I had wanted that I would've purchased something else.  This is my third Susan Deason DVD and the background music is always lovely during her workouts, her voice is very soothing, and her instruction is excellent.",1242000000,2,536,4.494845360824742

2111407,5,B0002OXUPG,"I really love this workout.  I have fibromyalgia and since I've discovered the exercise ball, it has changed my workouts for the better.  I like all the ball workouts from Gaiam that I've tried.  This DVD is no exception.  It provides clear, concise instructions.  The exercises flow from one to the other.  I've found that I feel invigorated and toned after finishing this workout although it is also gentle due to the nature of the exercise ball supporting the body in every aspect.  It is more challenging than a basic workout and you can adjust the intensity of the exercises.  One thing I've found very convenient about this particular DVD is that each exercise is its own chapter.  Therefore if you want to skip an exercise you can just go to the next chapter instead of scanning through the current exercise.  Also you can pick and choose which sections you want to do by choosing the ""Custom"" option on the main menu.  There are three sections, the first concentrating on abs and upper body, the second on the lower body and various Pilates moves using the ball, and the last section a combination of allover body workout and stretching.  There is also a ""fundamentals"" section at the beginning to show correct placement on the ball and the basics of positioning, etc.  If you do the whole thing it takes about 45 minutes.",1179360000,46,1330,4.681034482758621
2111408,5,B0002OXUPG,"I am very pleased with this DVD.  Susan has a very calming quality to her voice, gives just enough instruction without being chatty.  I have been using the DVD less than a month and am already seeing and feeling results.  The moves are easy enough as not to be intimidating but challenging enough that I have to work.  All moves are doable -except for the ""teaser"", but can definitely feel that I have worked my core muscles.",1170115200,7,425,4.48051948051948
2111409,1,B0002OXUPG,"I am a huge pilates fan, so when my husband picked up this video for me I thought using a balance ball would give me an extra workout.  While I do love my balance ball, this video was so slow, and not challenging one bit.  There was maybe one or two excercises that I found challenging.

If you are not a regular excerciser, maybe this is a good starting point, but for me, I felt like I wasted an hour of my day without getting a workout.  Skip it if you are looking for a challenging video.",1153094400,11,492,4.041237113402062
2111410,5,B0002OXUPG,"If you've ever taken yoga or pilates, or have any idea at all what these things might entail, you know that one could comfortably refer to these as the subtle excercise arts.  It simply is not cardio.  It isn't step.  This is a toning workout, as pilates and yoga often are.

The narration on the video is very soothing, and thus may be listened to over and over again--very convenient as this is an excercise video.  The narration contains no repetitive catch phrases, no yee-haws and aerobic woopings.  Simple, calming, relaxing instruction, period.

True to its pilates roots, this tape encourages the use and development of the core muscles to stabalize the body while working all the major muscle groups.  Many of the moves are challenging for a first-timer, but this just means that the tape will continue to be beneficial over a long period of time.

If you're looking for something Paula Abdul-ish, an early 90's step aerobics with lots of cardio, shouting, loud techno beats, garish outfits and fake tans, please don't buy this very relaxing yet physically challenging video.",1141257600,67,1084,4.912087912087912
