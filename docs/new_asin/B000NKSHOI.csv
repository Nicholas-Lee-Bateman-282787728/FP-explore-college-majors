Comedy sketches from The Committee and Kentucky Fried Theatre

This volume has some great performances but seems lacking.  A couple of more goodies such as a blues or a harder rock band could have rounded it out, making me only give it 3 stars.  Sound & video quality is pretty good, and no lip-synching.

Strong on mellow rock, vocal pop, and soul, but at least the songs themselves are nearly all strong, even for artists I normally wouldn't like, it's enough to keep me interested.  I can't say that for most of the other volumes in the series.

The Kinks are in pretty good form here, and Brownsville Station is a hoot, bringing back memories of Jr. High for me when Smokin' came out.  Bill Withers sounds great.  Steve Miller does NOT play the song exactly like it sounds on the record but actually a bit more psychedelic, technical and awesome. Main reason to own this disc and the first 7 songs.  Also the comedy sketch by ""The Committee"" features a politically incorrect funny pre-WKRP Howard Hesseman playing the alpha male.

All in all, consistently enjoyable, even if some of the artists are not normally my cup of tea.

I recommend for the MS series, stick with the first 2 volumes of the 1973 & 1974 years, the Million Sellers, then after that, you're on your own.

Why can't they make the individual shows available so we can choose the artists we like best?",1245024000,4,2087,4.554959785522788

8179106,3,B000NKSHOI,"It's ok, it, but I remember as a child, it being more of like a family show, they cut it up into sections, I really didn't expect that, too technical for me.

8179108,1,B000NKSHOI,The Aerosmith cover for this More 1974 volume is wrong. It's from the same year but contained mostly rock and R&B acts while the real cover was Rufus and more of a combination. Very misleading. Surprised that no one else caught it.,1408406400,,231,4.523809523809524

Wolfman is here.
Mine came from Ebay.

Note:Brownsville Station sound better in the studio than live on some things.

What stands out for me on this particular volume is:

The Committee-8m-Excellent+Under Special Features.
The Steve Miller Band : Fly Like An Eagle
Olivia Newton-John ; If You Love Me,Let Me Know--Knows how to play up to the camera.
Gordon Lightfoot ; If You Could Read My Mine-voice.
Melissa Manchester : Midnight Blue--Her very cool voice.
Al Green : Tired of Being Alone--When he starts out with that very distinctive voice he has,the audience goes wild.
Billy Swan : I Can Help
Ace : How Long--Drummer

I like it when the bands pretty much match their studio recordings,that's what blows me away.

I still would recommend this one especially for what i listed that i liked.",1372204800,2,822,4.927536231884058
