8309569,4,B001HTAN6E,"Not bad Italian-made, English-dubbed sword-and-sandal adventure.  Goliath battles against sea monsters, angry Amazons, an evil usurper, hairy, brutish giants, and land monsters in order to right wrongs and save his beloved princess.  I ordered the DVD-R (pictured below) available from Movies Unlimited and that is the one to get.  The picture is sharp and clear and the color and overall quality is perfect.  Highly recommended for fans of the genre.",1422057600,,451,5.4
