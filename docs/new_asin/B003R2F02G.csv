8402989,5,B003R2F02G,"I haven't been doing this long enough to talk results, but this is an excellent dvd. I'm an intermediate exerciser and I have tons of fitness dvds. You will get an excellent total body workout in 25mins a day, and that is exactly what I like.

Pros:
Quick, full body workouts + no weights!
<30mins
Strength and cardio

Cons:
The music isn't the greatest, but once you're working you hardly notice it.
Very basic (that's not necessarily a bad thing, but this isn't a flashy/fun/party workout)
No rotation/calendar",1396656000,2,512,4.806818181818182
8402990,4,B003R2F02G,"This DVD has 3 20-minute workouts, or you can choose to play all at once.  I really like these workouts. She shows an easier variation of a move, then shows the more advanced version. She calls them circuit workouts, but in my opinion, they are not really circuits because there is a break between each move. They are basically full-body bodyweight strength workouts. Intermediate level. Marta doesn't talk much, she mostly just talks to instruct without a lot of extra chatter.",1333670400,6,478,4.901234567901234
8402991,1,B003R2F02G,"Maybe I'm just not in good enough shape for this, but I found this extremely difficult to do, plus it was boring.  It seemed to be more a showcase of how in-shape this lady is, and to show off her cleavage, than helpful in it being used to shape up.",1323907200,,249,3.98
8402992,4,B003R2F02G,"There are 3 workouts on the endurance dvd. They are a little bit over 21 minutes each. Each workout is made up of 3 circuits that include squats, lunges, planks, mountain climbers, & kicks.  There are variations of each of those movements. I just listed the basic movements, I promise, she makes them much more difficult & will get your heart pumping!  I am impressed how tough the workout gets, by the end of one workout....I am drenched.

The reason for four stars is lack of warm up & cool down.  Marta means well, however, maybe because english is not her native language....everything she says is monotone. A little enthusiasm would of helped me a little, sometimes I need that to keep thinking positive during the pain.  Those are my only complaints.

I recommend this to high intermediate to advanced level exercisers.  There is a modifier, still it is intense.  Definately efficient, to the point workout!  I plan on getting her other workouts because they are so efficient & intense =)",1281398400,5,994,4.766081871345029
8402993,4,B003R2F02G,"I received a set of the Montenegro Method DVDs for review.

These DVDs promise 21 minutes 21 days to a healthier life and I can't disagree.  Anything you do will help you to be healthier if you do it consistently - The Montenegro Method DVDs are no exception.  Keep in mind that you will need dumbbells for the MM21 Strength DVD - though I opted to use my 25 lbs infant for most of the workout and that was a challenge.

The MM21 Endurance was by far my favorite DVD and why I titled my post great for trainers.  If you are a trainer looking for some complex and challenging moves to share with your clients or classes, this is perfect for you.  There are great circuits given, you can incorporate these into Bootcamp and other group fitness classes.",1280361600,7,750,4.359712230215828
