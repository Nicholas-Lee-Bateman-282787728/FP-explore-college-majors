4983751,5,B006CR2P58,"The writing is genius.  People who love playing with words will enjoy the visual and spoken puns and twists.  The acting and directing are great.  The movie is very engaging and relate-able, and (spoiler alert) there is no cliche Hollywood ending.  A superb indie.",1329264000,,264,4.931818181818182
4983752,4,B006CR2P58,Silly dudes doing stupid stuff. What a great movie! Suggest you have a beer of three wile watching the flick.,1329264000,,109,4.5
4983753,5,B006CR2P58,"Stags is an exceptionally poignant film in the way it deals with both the specifics of relationships in today's youth culture and the universality of commitment issues for people of all ages.  Sophisticated and funny, the characters unfold, each unique in his own way, adding different aspects to this dilemma.  The film is well written, entertaining, and thought provoking.",1329264000,,374,5.322033898305085
4983754,5,B006CR2P58,"This is a sophisticated, exceptionally well written and directed comedy that deals with the dilemma of today's youth culture where ' serious emotional committments' are put on the back burner and superficial relationships and 'fun' are the order of the day for too many years.

Hats off to Jaime Greenberg for his talented approach to this subject.",1329264000,,348,5.105263157894737
4983755,5,B006CR2P58,Saw this gem at tribeca film fest and have been waiting for it to reach stores. Glad to finally see it available.,1329177600,,113,4.181818181818182
4983756,5,B006CR2P58,"Saw the movie at a NY screening, thought it was great! It's wonderful that there are indie films like this one out there that aren't all about cheap jokes and big budget, but smart and clever and imaginative like this one! Would always recommend this movie!!!!",1329177600,,260,4.673913043478261
4983757,5,B006CR2P58,"This film is fantastic - funny, poignant, nostalgic.  It's Swingers meets Annie Hall - highly, highly recommended!  One of the great undiscovered independent gems of the new millennium.",1329091200,,185,5.571428571428571
4983758,5,B006CR2P58,"Greenberg has a distinct voice. He's really doing something with this filmmaking thing that you don't often see! Especially when it comes to dudes. He's got them down. Watch this movie, you'll have a good time.",1329091200,,210,4.861111111111111
4983759,5,B006CR2P58,"A new and young  Woody Allen language. Sharp, sophisticated and snottily unforgiving ""
Very Urban humor , psychological insightful into the mind set and dynamics of our ""singles"" culture.",1328918400,,187,5.448275862068965
8496576,4,B006CR2P58,"The tag is about right, ""Swingers"" like and ""Diner"" like, but not quite on the same level.  I debated between 3 and 4 stars, but chose 4, gave it the benefit of the doubt.
Worth a watch if you like ""Swiingers"", but not quite as polished.",1488240000,,237,4.1521739130434785
8496577,5,B006CR2P58,Four friends in their late 30's at a cusp- remain childish or finally become adults. A modern coming of age story for a generation that faced little to challenge them and much to subvert them from living a courageous life. Stags is sweet and quirky and I loved watching the boys find their faltering and misguided way towards a more meaningful and challenging life. This film is very funny and the acting is excellent.,1428710400,,418,4.662162162162162
8496578,4,B006CR2P58,"Full disclosure - I went to College with Mark Giordano, one of the stars of the movie, and a really great stand up comic and actor in NYC.  You can catch parts of his act if you google it.  I watched this on a plane flight.  There is a decent amount of nudity, so you have to be a little bit careful there.  Other than that, the movie is hilarious.  If you like movies like Caddyshack, or Theres something about Mary, or farrelly brothers comedies, you will think this is hilarious.  Totally worth a watch.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is I didn't think anybody would believe it.",1393372800,,592,4.232142857142857
8496579,5,B006CR2P58,"I have not yet seen the film, but have seen some previous work of Jamie Greenberg. Great comic sensibility and whip-smart. Can't wait to see STAGS!",1335312000,,147,4.6923076923076925
8496580,5,B006CR2P58,"This movie was bar none one of the most entertaining movies I have seen this year.  I am not even beginning to kid on this.  The script was tight, the humor poignant and deliberate while still being uproarious as well as meaningful.  There were times I wondered if the protagonist, I'll call him Frank, didn't wonder a bit more about his role as a ninja.  I mean they didn't even mention the fact he was a ninja once in the movie!  If the film has one flaw, it would be that they not once addressed the fact that Frank, I'll call him Bill, that Bill was a ninja with super powers kinda like Sub Zero in Mortal Kombat [sic].  So Bill has this other life as a ninja named Doshie.  Doshie runs around saving peoples lives but at the same time, struggling with his own past.  You see Doshie, also known as Mariah, is actually the three headed daughter of the god Namoramicon, the deity in charge of children who sell wrapping paper door to door.  Mariah has to come to terms with her own past, which is actually made worse by the fact that Mariah works by day as a garbage man named Frank who, every Boxing Day has to bear witness to the veritable tons of wrapping paper thrown away, which brings him to an existential crisis of Talmudic proportions.  And how does Frank deal with this, he takes it out on the evil vampires that have, up to this point, been dominating the wrapping paper, tissue and associated ribbon industry in Detroit.

But they don't even mention this once.

But other than that, it was an exceptional film!  Buy this now!!!",1335312000,,1541,4.383802816901408
8496581,5,B006CR2P58,"Saw this at last year's Tribeca Film Festival and am glad to see it's been picked up for DVD release. Very funny cast, writing and story. Was solidly entertaining with ton's of great one-liners!",1335312000,,194,4.735294117647059
8496582,4,B006CR2P58,"Unlike all of the other 15 people who have ""reviewed"" this film so far, I am actually an objective reviewer who is not affiliated with the movie.
I checked all of the other 15 ""reviews,"" and all of them are written by people who are obviously affiliated with the movie (since, if you click on ""See all my reviews"" for each of them, this is the only thing they have ever reviewed on Amazon). That's a dead giveaway. One of them even admits to being affiliated with the movie.
Yet, despite these 15 other meaningless reviews, this actually is a really good movie. I wasn't expecting much, given that it was obviously a low-budget production. However, I was pleasantly surprised. It was authentic, fast-paced, and smartly written. The characters were likeable, and virtually everything in the movie was realistic. The writer/director also obviously has some unique creativity, which he wove into the story in some interesting ways.
If this guy could get funded with a larger budget, he could really make a name for himself with some high-quality, innovative, and entertaining movies.
The only problem with the movie (other than the somewhat dark, grainy, and slightly ""washed out"" color quality that is common with film in low-budget movies) is that two of the four main characters look so much alike that it took me about half of the movie to distinguish between them, causing me to miss some of the plot advances for each of these characters.",1330041600,4,1441,4.838056680161944
8496583,3,B006CR2P58,Must see Indie. It was an audience hit at the VisionFest in Tribeca this past year. Film by rising New York based director-writer Jamie Greenberg,1329955200,,145,4.84
8496584,5,B006CR2P58,"I saw this film at the Tribeca film festival and I loved it.  Great cast and story.  Josh Weinstein is hysterical as Morty and
