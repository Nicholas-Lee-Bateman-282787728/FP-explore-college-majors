2828130,5,B000PUAIOI,"While looking for new Yoga DVD's, I stumbled on the Ana Bret & Ravi ones and thought I would try one because of all the raving reviews.... I think I am addicted. I've been doing traditional yoga for a few years now. I do not exercise at night, (I'm more of a early bird) but I find myself loving to do this anytime, even past my bed time! I want to do it every day.
When I first put it on to try it , I thought it was all a little weird, but after doing it, I love it, love the music and just the fun of it. I just purchased 3 more of their tapes ""Dr house call"", ""Fat free yoga"" and ""Kundalini Yoga for beginners and beyond""
It's different, fun, energizing and relaxing...",1194393600,9,673,3.9558823529411766
2828131,5,B000PUAIOI,"I am a 40 something year-old man who has never done yoga.  I am not very limber and assumed that yoga was not for me.  I tried it as a last resort for my back pain--I felt like someone was stabbing me in the back with each step that I took.  After reading all of the five star reviews, I decided to give this DVD a shot.  Getting out of bed used to be a chore--I would wake up all stiff and sore.  After doing a morning stretch and the sciatica (back pain) section of this DVD for three days, the pain was all but gone.  I have now been using the DVD for a week.  I have been trying other sections of the DVD, and I have to say that I feel much more energized, centered, and happy, not to mention that my back is almost completely pain-free.  Ana and Ravi give modifications for bending-challenged people like me, and I can actually do them!  This DVD is certainly worth the money.  I feel good about healing my body without medication or surgery.  Thank you, Ana and Ravi, for making me feel ten years younger.",1194220800,22,1011,4.133333333333334
2828132,5,B000PUAIOI,"Being an absolute newbie to yoga with chronic hip pain and headaches, I can attest to the effectiveness of this tape. The poses are easy enough for an absolute beginner to attempt and do, and the results are immediate and astonishing. The tape targets various topics, such as ""energy to burn,"" ""flexibility & strength,"" ""digestible you,"" ""delete depression,"" ""soothe stress - free fatigue"" and more.  Since the first time I tried this tape, my pain has been eased or, more often,  just plain gone, and my tight muscles loosened significantly. Nothing else I have ever experienced seems to work as well as the sequences on this tape. It came to me highly recommended, and I am passing on that recommendation. ""Yoga Quick Fixes,"" as well as the other one ""Yoga House Call""  is worth every penny. Now I never start or end my day without some of their style of yoga. I plan to buy more of their DVD's. They are absolutely the best.",1193270400,4,927,4.640243902439025
2828133,5,B000PUAIOI,"Yoga Quick Fixes is one of the latest offerings from the husband/wife team of Ravi Singh/Ana Brett.  In the same style as their previous videos, Quick Fixes features Ana alone on screen, practicing on a small rug in an all-white room, while she and Ravi take turns providing voiceover instruction.  You'll recognize some of the music and yoga sequences from their previous videos, but there's plenty that's brand new here as well.

Quick Fixes has over 3 hours of footage, which felt a bit overwhelming to me at first!  The Main Menu offers the following options:
*Play DVD
*Tune In
*Breath Primer
*Power Surge Warm-Ups (14 minutes)
*Yoga Quick Fixes
*Yoga Quick Sets
*Deep Relaxation
*3 Amazing Meditations
*Closing Prayer

The Main Menu leads to several sub-menus as described below.

Quick Fixes:  Positive PMS (10m), So Long Sciatica (7m), Delete Depression (16m), Digestible You (9m), Asthma No More (5m), Soothe Stress  Free Fatigue (8m), Maximize Memory (6m), Headache Helper (6m), Anxiety Antidote (10m), On the Spot Addiction Alternative (16m), Sleep Easy (6m)

Yoga Quick Sets:  Energy to Burn (12m), Flexibility & Strength (12m), All Systems Go! (17m), Balance & Joy (16m), Kundalini Yoga Superset (22m)

3 Amazing Meditations:  Amazing Minute Breath (6m), So Darshan Chakra Kriya (3.5m), Sa-Ta-Na-Ma Meditation (14m) [These same meditation sequences also appear on Ravi and Ana's other new release, Dr. Yoga House Call.]

On their website and elsewhere, Ravi and Ana recommend that you begin with the Tune-Up and Breath Primer (optional), do the Warm-Ups, and then select from amongst the Quick Fixes and Quick Sets (these shorter sequences are meant to stand alone as well).  There is some overlap amongst the segments--for example, some of the Warm-Ups and Quick Fix sequences appear as part of some of the Quick Sets.  However, the transitions are virtually seamless, and all of the practices flow very well.  Ravi and Ana frequently make statements about what the exercises are designed to do for you (eg, ""according to yoga, this will give you _____""), although they generally don't describe exactly how this process works.

If you've never done yoga before, this DVD might not be the best place to start, as Kundalini yoga is fairly distinct from the more traditional forms of hatha yoga with which most people are familiar.  Similarly, if you've practiced yoga but are new to Kundalini, be prepared for something a little different--i.e., most of the exercises will not be recognizable as classic postures, there is a lot more movement, and different breathing techniques are used, particularly the Breath of Fire (although I found that BOF was used a little less here than in some of Ravi and Ana's other videos).

Overall, this is an extremely well-produced, well-organized Kundalini yoga video that is a must-have for Ravi/Ana fans.",1190851200,96,2854,5.138528138528138
2828134,5,B000PUAIOI,"I absolutely love this DVD and feel the absolute need to some part of this DVD on a daily basis.  This is the second DVD I now own by Ana and Ravi.  I have just ordered the ""House Calls"" DVD and cannot wait until it arrives.  The first DVD I ordered by these two was the beginner's practice and I wasn't crazy about it so I wasn't sure what I would think about this DVD but I LOVE it!  It wakes me up and gets me going for the day.  It's even great for winding down at night!  Buy it.....you can't go wrong!!!!",1190764800,6,510,3.9029126213592233
2828135,5,B000PUAIOI,"Along with their other DVD's Ravi and Ana make a statement of peace and contentment at the same time as showing us how to move not only our body, but our minds to a better place.  Another DVD to have in a super collection.  They are for anyone.  Beginners do not fear, but enjoy and modify without feeling you are not meeting a certain expectation.  This is truly a whole body and mind exercise.",1190073600,4,395,4.297297297297297
2828136,5,B000PUAIOI,"There were days where I had been up and running around for 20 hours straight where I felt like going to bed without my Kundalini Yoga but then I'd think about the quick effect it seems to have on my energy and endurance and happiness levels and decide to hit the mat even if for only 15-20 minutes. I thought I was going to wear out the 25 minute sets on Kundalini Yoga for Beginners & Beyond (and the 20 minute set of Yoga Bliss Hips) before I got the new Ravi and Ana dvds. They quickly went from being a ""want"" to being a ""need"" when I started my new job .My job is demanding mentally, physically and time-wise and the new dvds have really helped me stay on an even keel through out the last 4 weeks. Anyway, thanks again!",1188000000,7,725,4.112676056338028
2828137,5,B000PUAIOI,"I love this DVD and Yoga House Calls.  I have completed most of the individual sets.  I start with the Tune In and then complete a Warm-Up. After the Warm-Up, I just let the DVD go until I have to stop to relax and meditate.  Sometimes I practice for 30 minutes sometimes for 90 minues and this is the flexiblity that you would have with these DVD's.  Aside from the convenience, the exercises, meditations and relaxation leave you feeling like you can start the day on a very positive note!  I have most of this series and I will continue to rotate these two new DVD's in and out of my rotations.  Great job Ravi and Ana.

2828138,5,B000PUAIOI,"Okay, it's official.  Ravi Singh and Ana Brett are the official King and Queen of kundalini yoga dvd's.  The two new ones are wonderful!  Others have written detailed reviews so all I can add at this point is that both dvds have the same 3 meditations: 1 minute breath,sodarshan chakra kriya and kirtan kriya.  One little thing was that I was expecting 6 new meditations instead of just 3 meditations. For whatever reason, the same meditations are on both dvds.  I especially love the sa ta na ma (kirtan kriya) meditation.  You get the full 11 minute version (normally done for 31 minutes).  Yogi Bhajan said that this is the most important meditation in all of kundalini yoga and if you only do one meditation, this one is it.  Thank you raviana, now I can do this meditation for 40 days using your dvd.
I would have liked it if they had given us 11 minutes of sodarshan charkra kriya, as such they just give 2 1/2 minutes.  All in all great set for just about everything that ails you in today's modern, fast paced, toxic life. Sat Nam",1185321600,5,1038,4.449735449735449

It adds great circulation to the head and neck areas.",1388793600,3,382,4.394366197183099
2828152,4,B000PUAIOI,"This review will have a two-part format. In the first part, I'll describe the contents of the DVD as well as my thoughts on them. In the second part, I'll say some more general things about Ana and Ravi and kundalini yoga. It seems the negative reviews of their DVDs come mainly from people who didn't know what to expect when ordering kundalini yoga DVDs -- because they ARE a little bit different from what you're used to, if you've only practiced hatha yoga in the past. I am unabashedly an Ana and Ravi fan, but hopefully my evaluation will help you make the correct decision for yourself, even if your opinion happens not to be the same as mine.

----------
Part I
----------

Unlike most of Ana and Ravi's DVDs, Yoga Quick Fixes does not have the matrix menu which normally allows you to customize the length of your workout. You will need to keep your DVD remote handy if you want to do more than one segment in a sitting.  All exercises in this DVD are done equally on both sides of the body.

Tune In (2:16): This segment is similar/the same in many of Ana's and Ravi's DVDs; you sit cross-legged, focus on your breathing, and chant ""ong namo guru dev namo"" three times.

Breath Primer (4:35): If you are not familiar with kundalini yoga, you will definitely want to follow along here. It's actually a pretty good refresher for anyone who has practiced for awhile, as well. You learn how to do long deep breathing, a panting breath that serves as an introduction to breath of fire, and then a standard breath of fire technique.

Power Surge Warm-Ups (14): This is a long warm-up for one of Anas and Ravis DVDs.  This segment consists of the following exercises.

*Sit cross-legged and grind your stomach in a circle
*Flex your spine back and forth; first hold your shins and then later hold your knees
*Circle your head around
*With your legs extended along the ground, extend your arms parallel to the ground and lean forward and back
*With your legs extended along the ground, lean forward, hold your ankles, and do a static stretch (breath of fire)
*Do table or bridge with breath of fire
*Lying on your back, alternate lifting your opposite arm and leg

Yoga Quick Fixes: These segments claim to be helpful with a variety of ailments.  Take the health claims with a grain of salt (the DVD does start with a disclaimer about health claims coming from traditional sources).  I find Ana and Ravi to be spot on when it comes to skeletal issues (so the sciatica segment is WONDERFUL for me).  However, I am not sure how much I believe when they talk about the glands, for example.  Also, please do not use this DVD as a substitute for seeing a doctor, especially for problems like depression and addiction.  That being said, the program in this DVD should not be harmful when used as a supplement to other medical treatment.

I believe the point of these short segments is to do whatever one you need at the time.  I will warn you, though, that most of them do not constitute full yoga workouts (with warm-up, deep relaxation, etc.) with the possible exception of Delete Depression.  On the one hand, this is a great time saver.  On the other hand, please be careful and don't overextend yourself.  Do the warm-up segment if you need it!

Positive PMS (10): This segment is good for the legs and lower back, in general, and consists of the following exercises.

*With the soles of your feet together, rock back and forward (make sure you have room; I slide across the floor when I do this one!)
*Stretch forward over your legs (soles of your feet still together)
*Lie on back, lift hips into bridge, then come back down
*Lie on stomach, push up into cobra, then back down
*Stretch pose (on back, head and heels raised 6 inches) with long deep breathing

So Long Sciatica (7): I love the deep stretch this gives to my legs, hips, and thighs.  This segment consists of the following exercises.

*With your legs in front of you on the floor, pull one foot into the opposite thigh, lean down over the extended leg
*Cross legs with one shin over the other, lean forward (this is a static stretch)
*Shoulderstand with your legs 30 degrees apart

Delete Depression (16): This segment, as mentioned above, is almost a complete workout on its own.  It consists of the following exercises.

*Hold your shins, flex your spine back and forth
*From frog, straighten your legs, then go back down into frog
*Camel pose (several modifications offered)
*Sat kriya (Google it, since Im not allowed to provide links here)
*Stretch pose (see above) with breath of fire
*With your hands in a mudra (hand position) at temple level, say the following mantra (wha wha hay hay wha wha hay hay wha wha hay hay guru) moving your hands forward at each sound until the last, when you extend your hands fully

Digestible You (9): Parts of this one are a challenge for me.  In particular, I have trouble doing all the breath work in the last exercise.  That might be a good goal to work towards.  This segment consists of the following exercises.

*Inhale through puckered lips (16 parts), then hold breath and grind your stomach in a circle
*With your right fist pressed into your navel and your other hand over it, sit on your heels and bow your head to the floor
*Lie on your back, move your legs alternately to 60 degrees, knees to chest, 60 degrees, and back down to the floor, in conjunction with holding the breath in and out

Asthma No More (5): This segment consists of the following exercises.

*Stand, hook your thumbs, raise your arms, lean back as far as you can, and do breath of fire
*With your hands in fists and your thumbs pointing out, hold your arms at 60 degrees
*Sit and do long, light breathing through your nose (theres some visualization here, too)

Soothe Stress Free Fatigue (8): This segment consists of the following exercises.

*With your elbows against your ribs and one palm up, the other down, move your forearms up and down
*Do long deep breathing through your nose
*Interlace hands first over your sternum, then your navel, then your solar plexus, inhaling and exhaling each time

Maximize Memory (6): Please note: too much cat/cow can be hard on the wrists.  If you have wrist issues, you may not want to do this one every day.  This segment consists of the following exercises.

*Alternating cat/cow stretches
*Kneeling and head bowed to floor, interlace hands behind back, inhale your arms up in three parts, exhale down in one part
*Seated, hook your fingertips together and pull

Headache Helper (6): This segment consists of the following exercises.

*Hook your palms at throat level, twist your elbows right and left with your head also twisting (i.e., head left, elbows right, etc.)
*Inhale shoulders up, exhale shoulders down
*Roll your head in circles
*Lie on your back, lift your head, do long deep breathing
*Rub the fatty part of your palm under your thumb with the opposite hand

Anxiety Antidote (10): This segment consists of the following exercises.

*Curl your ring and little finger under your thumb, put your elbows at your ribs, inhale and move your hands close to your body; exhale and move your hands away
*Relax on your back; inhale through your nose, hold your breath, exhale with your mouth; then inhale mouth, hold, exhale nose; repeat

On the Spot Addiction Alternative (16): This segment consists of the following exercises.

*With your hands in a mudra (hand position) and your elbows at your ribs, do breath of fire
*Hold your breath, put the underside of your tongue on the roof of your mouth, swallow
*Interlace hands over your diaphragm, inhale through puckered lips, exhale through your nose
*With your hands in fists, press your thumbs into your temples, grind your teeth side to side, and say sa ta na ma silently in your head

Sleep Easy (6): This segment consists of the following exercises.

*In bridge (also called table in other peoples DVDs), do long deep breathing
*Block your right nostril; inhale in 4 parts; block your left nostril; exhale in 1 part; repeat

Yoga Quick Sets: These are accessible from the main menu and are somewhat comparable to the pre-set selections that appear on some of Ravis and Anas other DVDs.  These are combinations of moves from other segments on the DVD and are intended to be short, complete kundalini yoga workouts.  I won't go over them again since the content has already been described elsewhere.  If youd rather not keep your DVD remote handy, these might be a good solution to the issue of combining exercises from shorter segments on the DVD.

Deep Relaxation (6): This is similar in many of Ravi's and Ana's DVDs. Lie on your back, slow your breathing, and listen to Ravi.

3 Amazing Meditations: You get three different meditation sections to choose from on this DVD.  All of them are classics that youll hear discussed elsewhere, especially if you buy more of Anas and Ravis DVDs or subscribe to their e-mail newsletter.

Amazing Minute Breath (6:14): Inhale, hold your breath, and exhale.  The goal is to work up to each inhalation, hold, and exhalation taking 20 seconds (for a total of one minute per breath).

So Darshan Chakra Kriya (3:36): Block your right nostril, inhale with your left.  Pump your stomach to the rhythm wahay guru (spoken by Ravi).  Exhale with your right nostril.  Repeat.

Sa-Ta-Na-Ma Meditation (6:30): Press your thumbs to your index finger, middle finger, ring finger, and little finger, in turn, while saying sa ta na ma (one sound per finger touch).  You start out singing, then whispering, then finally just thinking sa ta na ma in your head.  The music in this section leaves a little to be desired.  Its just a synthesizer (or something along those lines) and its not very good.  This is the only segment where I have a complaint about the music, though.

Closing Prayer (2:16): This is similar to what appears in other Ravi/Ana DVDs.

For those of you familiar with Ravi's and Ana's DVDs, this is one of the ones with the pink circle rug and flower pattern on the floor, the white background, and dark-haired Ana. I've noticed a lot of the music in those overlaps, as do some of Ana's outfits. Youll recognize a handful of the exercises from other dark-haired Ana DVDs, as well.  Much of the music is Ana singing different mantras, and I generally like it quite a bit (exceptions noted above). This DVD does not involve a fair amount of mantra chanting (performed by the participants at home as well as on the part of the narrators) as described above.

If you have plantar fasciitis and sciatica, do the warm-ups, positive PMS, and so long sciatica segments to work the hamstrings, inner thighs, and psoas muscle. These exercises are great to get rid of stiffness, first thing in the morning.

If you like breath work, you get all types here.  Its great to see the range of what can be incorporated into a kundalini yoga practice, when it comes to breathing.  The camera work is OK but not great (too many fades in and out and too much focusing on sometimes odd parts of Anas body).  The sound is usually quite good but there are a few times when Ravis voiceover sounds tinny, for lack of a better word.

Ana and Ravi do offer some suggestions for modifications of certain poses. And don't forget -- you don't have to keep up with Ana. Work at your own pace.  (I have to slow down in the delete depression segment when it comes to frog pose -- I cant do it anywhere near as fast as Ana can.  And also, I often modify camel pose and/or shoulderstand.)

----------
Part II
----------

Now, on to a more general discussion of kundalini yoga in general, and Ana's and Ravi's DVDs in particular.

Most of the yoga that people are familiar with falls under the umbrella of hatha yoga. Perhaps you've done a series of static poses, or some vinyasa/flow yoga. Kundalini yoga is not exactly like either of these, although Ana's and Ravi's DVDs do incorporate elements of hatha yoga (e.g., this DVD has camel pose in it). However, kundalini yoga is also what I would consider to be a very active form of yoga, consisting of some repeated movements and a lot more work with the breath than you may be used to. It can be difficult to keep up with at first, but can be very rewarding if you stick with it. If you are bored of holding static poses all the time, or if you want a bit more movement but hate vinyasa (sorry, but I am not a fan of flow yoga), kundalini might really work well for you. And, as I said earlier, use the modifications Ana and Ravi discuss if you need to use them. Yes, Ana is fit (and this makes her an excellent demonstrator for the poses), but this is not a competition. Don't strain yourself, and don't try to keep up with her. Just try to improve a little bit every time!

Kundalini yoga also involves a lot of meditation. Sometimes this is quiet and involves breathing either in a sitting position or lying down, occasionally with your hands in a mudra (hand position). Sometimes it involves chanting a mantra. This DVD does have a lot of chanting.  If you are uncomfortable with mantras for religious reasons, check out Ana's and Ravi's website (can't post links in reviews but they're easy to find through Google) for alternatives.

With respect to calorie-burning, this is probably not the sort of program that will make you shed a ton of weight. What it is good for, is improving your mood and your flexibility. And as a physical activity, it does burn some calories and strengthen some parts of your body. But kundalini yoga works on your inner self as well as your outer self, and so some parts are a little less ""active"" than others. For my own part, I still do plenty of pretty intense cardio at other times of the day.

Ana's outfits are a bit skimpy, but certainly nothing less than you would see at the beach. And the reason she dresses like she does is so that you can really see her performing the movements and asanas. That way you know exactly how to position yourself for maximum benefit. (Most of the time, kundalini yoga is done with the eyes closed, anyway.) There is not a lot in the way of initial instruction in this DVD. If you are familiar with Ana's and Ravi's work, you can jump right in. But if you are new to kundalini yoga, watch it first. Observe Ana, listen to the cues, make sure you understand. You'll be glad for the lack of excessive instruction later -- you don't want to be told on the 20th time you do a DVD how to do camel; you know it by this point!

If you are struggling with a pose, or don't feel there's an adequate explanation, Ravi and Ana are very accessible and quite nice. They have contact information on their website (the URL is on the DVD case) and usually get back to you in a couple of days. They also have a monthly e-mail newsletter that I enjoy.",1386547200,7,14757,4.579087452471483
2828153,4,B000PUAIOI,"I held off on purchasing this DVD for quite a while.  I wasn't sure that tiny, short quick fixes were going to do the job and I wanted a well-balanced, practice.  Well, I admit that I did not find the ""quick fixes"" in themselves to be of that great a benefit.  If I was feeling nervous, simply doing the Anxiety Antidote did little to nothing for me.  I was also puzzled while no matrix has ever been created for this DVD as I felt it would have been really beneficial although the DVD is extremely well chaptered.  However, I found the pre-sets very helpful as Ravi and Ana help you set up mini-practices.  For me, the Joy & Balance pre-set, followed by the Sa-Ta-Na-Ma meditation, was alone worth the price of the DVD. There was one time when I was feel very nervous and out of balance for 10 days in a row; my appetite was down quite a bit, too.  I did the aforementioned pre-set and meditation and it immediately set me right.  Thank you, Ravi and Ana!",1360540800,4,956,4.301675977653631
2828154,1,B000PUAIOI,"I love the stretching and relaxational benefits of yoga, but this is this way too weird for me.  Not my cup of tea.",1358640000,,115,4.0
2828155,5,B000PUAIOI,"I've suffered with intense migraine headaches for most of my adult life. A friend suggested that I try the Headache Helper sequence on this tape. After about 3 weeks of doing it about 4-5 times per week I am happy to announce that my migraines are much less severe and happen much less often. I've also tried many of the other segments and pre-sets on this tape and I love them. I'm thrilled with this and plan to purchase many more of Ravi & Ana's DVD's. This is a completely novel type of yoga, much more emphasis on breathing along with the exercises, and it works!",1346976000,3,568,4.367924528301887
2828156,4,B000PUAIOI,"This is a great dvd for someone interested in kundalini yoga.  The menu is easy to use and Ana demonstrates the actions clearly.  My only issue with this dvd is that it bills itself as 3 hours of kundalini exercises, but the reality is that most sets are made up of the same exercises, in a different order or with slightly different breaths.  When I want a quick 15-30 minute workout, I'll go to this, but I get bored if I use it too many days in a row, since even if I am selecting different sets, I'm still doing the same exercises.  I'm glad I bought it and I'll definitely use it, but I'm glad it's not the only dvd in my yoga collection.  This is not the first Ana and Ravi dvd I would recommend.  I would also add the familiar kundalini yoga caviate.  Kundalini yoga is different from hatha and vinyasa yoga, so if before you buy a kundalini yoga dvd, read up on it and make sure that's the type of yoga you are really looking for.  (It's my favorite kind, if that makes a difference.)",1332806400,3,992,4.184210526315789
2828157,5,B000PUAIOI,"I own this and the Dr Yoga House Calls. I can't decide which is my favorite. I use both equally. There are some great workouts on this DVD that can really make a difference in life.

Thank you Ana and Ravi for saving my life.",1316649600,,242,4.020833333333333
2828158,4,B000PUAIOI,"I have to admit the DVD is a bit eccentric. Ana is the only person on the set on some funky colored rugs and demonstrates the Yoga moves. There are voice overs from Ravi and Ana. I find the fixes effective, though, I do believe with Yoga there is no such thing as a quick fix. That is our Western society speaking.

I like this DVD as a supplement to my other work out DVDs.",1305244800,,374,3.986666666666667
2828159,5,B000PUAIOI,"This is an must have DVD for any yogi whether beginner or advanced! If you don't think yoga can give you an amazing and thorough workout get ready for a big surprise with Ana & Ravis Kundalini Yoga! YQF is not matrixed like the others, but I just pop it in and do as much as time allows. This is one of my go-to workouts because with the number of different workouts - you never get bored. You can start the workout later on into the disc and just go for 10 or 20 or 30 or 40 minutes and always get an awesome workout! There are specifics - I love the So long sciatica for a stretchy relaxing workout, the PMS set is energizing, hip opening, flowing and fun - perfect. The Headache Helper I have used often - it works!!! Amazing. This DVD is pure magic! The music is awesome, the yoga is so energizing and I can feel it getting into and waking up my body on a very cellular level.",1293148800,3,880,4.063218390804598

- the 'sets' cannot be combined, so you're stuck doing yoga with the remote next to you, having to pick each section when one is finished (not like 10 minute solutions dvds), which really does not help with the flow
- the actual yoga parts are not what i would typically call yoga.. i really don't know how some of the moves 'help digestion' or 'help headaches', and honestly not only do i feel like it is a waste of time when i could be doing another form of actual exercise/relaxation, but i feel incredibly silly doing it
- ana's outfit is REALLY distracting. i personally find her shorts to be too tight, and it makes for a very distracting yoga session
- there is constant change in the voice overs with little to no flow

i should have stuck with my Rodnee Yee yoga dvds, and if you are looking for a good yoga dvd then i would suggest that one.",1292889600,3,1063,4.205882352941177
2828161,5,B000PUAIOI,"I seem to be buying all the Raviana DVDs, I got hooked wiht Beginners & Beyond (still one of my favorites because of the simplicity). This one is perfect if you have a headache and want a quick remedy. It also has a great on-the-spot addiction section. Also, this happens to be my favorite Kundalini Yoga DVD in terms of the music, so I do it often. I have actually done the entire DVD which runs for a very long time. However the Kundalini superset is kind of choppy. So 5 stars for what this DVD tries to do (i.e. offer yogic remedies for common ailments), but 3 stars for the superset workout.",1285372800,3,596,4.283185840707965
2828162,5,B000PUAIOI,"This is my new Ana & Ravi dvd and I love it, I have the beginner dvd of theirs and I like that too but became bored after doing it for 4 months. I do it 3-4x a week and last week I did it 7 days in a row. I leave my sessions feeling renewed, calm and energized. On this dvd I start with the 14 min warm up and then move into a series of the quick fixes. It's hard for me to do anything less than 70 minutes because I love the moves so well. My core is becoming stronger and the flexibility in my hips and legs definitely improved. My upper body strength is enjoying has also increased since starting a regular practice and I feel I move more gracefully. My appetite is curbed and my responses to stressful situations is more balanced.

At the end of my session I do the downward dog/up dog move that I learned in their beginners dvd along with a leg stretch move from Rodney Lee's Yoga Burn for a complete yoga workout.

I never thought I could keep up with a regular practice of yoga due to price for classes here in NYC and time limits. I've been taking off an on over the years so although not in yogi shape I know the moves and how to have patience with more difficult poses. And & Ravi are fantastic yoga teachers and I could not be happier with their style of teaching. When I feel like I need company and change of scenery I take my dvds and mat to  friend house and do yoga with them.

The moves may seem a bit odd at first but this is a dvd for both men and women. If you can drum up the courage to do something different you will not be disappointed.",1284854400,5,1560,3.97444089456869

2828164,5,B000PUAIOI,I do this one every morning lately and am loving the strength and ease with which it propels me into my day!  Since discovering Ana Brett & Ravi Singhs wonderful teaching style I have gotten almost every one of their programs. THEY ARE LITERALLY LIFE CHANGING! The changes in my life have been so profound and so swift yet graceful. It is nothing short of amazing that an ancient yogic practice could do so much for one from the physical to the emotional to the spiritual aspect. I can't recommend this or any of their dvds highly enough. There are numerous options here and you really can't go wrong with any of them. Enjoy!,1281484800,3,625,4.482456140350878
2828165,3,B000PUAIOI,"This wasn't one of my favorite Ravi and Ana Kundalini yoga DVDs (and I have most of their DVDs). I appreciate that Ravi and Ana want to bring yoga to the mainstream and they do so by addressing modern maladies.  Personally, I'm so grateful to have discovered the healing power of yoga.  However, I have philosophical problem with selling `quick fixes.'  Yoga to me is about balance and being slow and steady.

That being said, there were several things I liked about this workout:

**the clean, white set.

**the versatility of this DVD.  It's easily chaptered so you can pick and choose which sections you want to do.  You can choose individual sections, e.g. so long sciatica, delete depression, sleep ease, or you can choose the mini-workouts, e.g. energy to burn, balance and joy etc.  There is over 2  hours of material on this DVD.

**easy to pick and choose which sections you want to do.  I most often do the tune in, breath primer and power-up warm-ups for a quick pick me-up. This runs about 20 minutes.

**the explanations of what body parts were worked by each move.

What I didn't like about this workout:

**there's very little new material here.  This is just re-edited sections from prior workouts like Fat Free Yoga.

**the workout doesn't flow.  It's more like a series of exercises for different maladies.  I like my yoga to flow.

This is a good, versatile workout if you have specific problem areas you want to address.  I wouldn't recommend starting with this DVD if you want an introduction to traditional Kundalini yoga.",1280188800,19,1544,4.7293233082706765
2828166,3,B000PUAIOI,I'm not sure if it's just the type of yoga or the instructors but I found this dvd just too strange.  Some of the movements were not safe for my back and I'm in pretty good shape.  I do like the breathing and meditative focus but just found it strange to see this young woman doing these gyrations with a fixed smile and hearing the male voice...I'm going to keep trying it but like more down to earth types like Rodney Yee.,1276905600,,424,4.158536585365853
2828167,5,B000PUAIOI,"I love this yoga DVD.  I always enjoy watching Ana exercise, she is so young and sweet looking.  I love the music on this DVD, it is fun and I hum it even after. The meditations are especially relaxing. I have problems with tension and sleeplessness.  This is a fun and easy fix. Can't wait for their meditation DVD soon to come out.  Thank you Ravi and Ana",1256083200,,357,4.205882352941177
2828168,5,B000PUAIOI,"Quick Fixes, like all the Raviana dvds, is most excellent.  I totally enjoy starting at the beginning and just following through the entire dvd, because I don't want to miss any of the various segments, although picking and choosing the sets you want to follow is also a great option. When I finish following this or any one of their dvds, my spirits are lifted, I feel healthier and energetic, and yet I also feel relaxed and at peace, as it should be.  The work is challenging, yet playful and fun, and both Ravi and Ana come across as very sincere and ""real.""",1253059200,,562,4.446601941747573
2828174,5,B000PUAIOI,"A wonderful dvd to add to your yoga collection.  Ana & Ravi do it again with another great total body workout dvd.  This one is one of my favorite yoga dvd's because you can mix up your workouts and with over three hours of workouts, you'll never get bored.  The workouts are energizing, uplifting and I always feel very relaxed and energized after I do them.  You really feel like you've done a total body workout once you do any of Ana or Ravi's yoga workouts.  If you've never done this type of yoga before, I highly recommend it.  You will notice a difference in your body after just a few days and you will really feel the burn.  Yoga Quick Fixes is definitely a must-have and perfect for anyone, even beginners.  Thank you Ana & Ravi!",1252540800,,740,4.350364963503649
2828175,5,B000PUAIOI,"Ana and Ravi have done an amazing job with giving us a natural way to deal with our everyday issues. I am someone whom gets headaches often and I find when I do Headache Helper I feel so much better in such a short time.
I normally just hit play and go through the workout until I run out of time.
I only wish that it had the matrix menu like their other ones. No complaints though- I just love all their workouts and their caring nature.",1236297600,,438,4.045977011494253

I've been doing for quite some time and have seen an incredible difference in my flexibility.  Enjoy.",1234483200,2,363,4.609375
2828177,5,B000PUAIOI,"This is such a rich DVD. I want to memorize nearly all of it for use as needed. But it's a great workout, too. The meditations go deep. Ravi and Ana present health as common sense so that you want to do these exercises. The music and rhythm keep you going. They are gentle in their lifestyle suggestions so you don't feel pushed to do it their way, but supported in trying these excercises to see if they work.",1228176000,2,410,4.2025316455696204

I have done the first 3 at least a dozen times each, and was going to move to new ones. I was a bit disappointed in that the Yoga Quick Fixes is very similar to some of the other 2 DVDs - Fat Free Yoga - and I was really looking for new moves. I admit I have only done 25 minutes into the DVD......still, Kundalini by Ana and Ravi is the best home practice.",1226448000,2,453,3.778947368421053
2828179,5,B000PUAIOI,"This is a great DVD. It has something for everyone.  The main warm up is one of my favorites.  Ravi and Ana provide great voice overs and perfect timing.  My only problem is that once I put the dvd in the player , I often want to do the entire dvd instead of 1 or 2 segments!! It is certainly a keeper~ being a 2 year Kundalini yogi, I feel it has poses that everyone beginner to advanced can do! Edited to add: I did the So Long Sciatica set for 40 days in a row. I improved tremendously at being able to sit with one leg on top of the other and bending forward. It is a great set for opening your hips.",1226016000,3,604,3.8548387096774195
2828180,5,B000PUAIOI,"I discovered Kundalini Yoga about a year ago.  I went with a friend to a class after work one evening.  I have been hooked ever since.  I don't have the time to go to classes every day, but I knew I had to find a way to make Kundalini Yoga a daily commitment. I discoverd Ana and Ravi!  I have almost all of their DVD's now! I particularly like Yoga Quick Fixes because I can make my practice as long or as short as I want. The only thing I would change about it is for it to have the matrix, it makes it so much easier to customize and maximize my time.

The first hour of my day is devoted to Kundalini Yoga.  I rise just before dawn and spend at least thirty minutes on myself before I leave for my job as a therapist in the Jail. The calm I feel when I have finished my practice stays with me throughout the day and has helped me deal with many difficult situations at work. It has become more to me than just exercise,its about being in touch with my mind, body and spirit, and feeling that peace first thing in the morning.  Whenever I need a quick pick-me-up. I do breath of fire, my mind clears, and I can focus again.  So Darshan Chakra Kria, is my favorite breathing exercise.  When I started I could only manage about two sets, now I am up to eight! and I can do the whole sixteen counts!

When I get home, I belly dance, and I have noticed that my movements are much more fluid.  My sciatica has gone! my posture has improved, my A1C count is down, and I feel ALIVE! Everyone should be exposed to this healing artform! Thank you Ana and Ravi, for making these DVD's accessible and affordable. That first hour of the day between waking and Dawn is my favorite hour of the day!  ""May the long time sun shine upon you, may ALL love surround you, and the pure light within you, guide your way on!  Satnam.",1225843200,12,1813,4.1164772727272725
2828181,5,B000PUAIOI,"This one is just as amazing as all the others, but it has the added bonus of giving you quick and effective workouts! For those of us who sometimes find ourselves short on time, this is a must have!!!",1225756800,3,200,4.153846153846154
2828182,5,B000PUAIOI,"This video is great because it breaks the workouts into manageable pieces.  Try to fit a small 5-25 minute workout into your day when you first wake up or get home from work in the evening and begin to experience an amazing difference in your life!!  The video also contains segments that concentrate on specific issues such as anxiety or depression which is nice.  There are over 3 hours of mini-sets to choose from!!!

Ana & Ravi are sincere in their instructor and extremely knowledgeable.  You will find yourself transformed after a few short sessions.  A+ review from a satisfied customer!  I'll have this DVD for years to come!!!!!",1225584000,2,637,4.7889908256880735
2828183,5,B000PUAIOI,"This was the first Ravi and Ana DVD I purchased, so if you're just beginning Kundalini yoga, have no fear!  After doing traditional yoga for two years, I became bored and decided to try this DVD based solely on the reviews.  At first I was skeptical and wondered how these exercises could possibly benefit me.  However, it didn't take long for me to realize that this type of yoga is amazing!  I've never felt better in my life, and I actually look forward to practicing yoga each day again.

I especially love how this DVD, like some of their others, is broken into chapters.  Positive PMS, Delete Depression, and Balance & Joy are a few of my favorite segments.  I now own 4 other Ravi and Ana DVDs, including AM & PM, Yoga Beauty Body, Yoga Hips Bliss, and Dr. Yoga House Call.  Be assured that no matter which one you try, you will not be disappointed!",1220832000,5,856,4.407643312101911
2828209,5,B000PUAIOI,"I just started buying their DVD's.  I have done hatha yoga for years and had slipped away from a daily practice, then slipped into no practice at all.  I stumbled into kundalini a few years ago and stumbled again into this couple just recently. I started out by laying down watching it and just doing the breathing and whatever else I could do with almost no effort.  I'm not kidding.

Then I cleared out a spot to do it.  Then decided I needed a better, bigger, quieter spot.

I pulled my back a little this week and I forced myself into my better, bigger, quieter spot to actually do some of this DVD---and it worked so well I couldn't believe it. I slept like a rock.  I definitely did not do the whole DVD, just a couple of sections and the easiest, easiest ones in those sections.  It's a little bit of magic.

I'm getting all their DVD's.  I want to see everything.",1216080000,11,871,4.288343558282208
2828210,5,B000PUAIOI,This DVD is Awesome using tecniques that date back to when there weren't any quick fix pills. The antiquated chiropractor and pharmacist were Yogis and people forget that.

Keep them coming!,1213228800,5,377,4.7272727272727275
2828211,5,B000PUAIOI,"I enjoy this dvd for its versatility. I try to do yoga each morning for 25-40 minutes. This morning I woke up late and didn't have as much time as normal, so I tried one of the segments from the Yoga Quick Sets (Energy to Burn) at 12 minutes. I honestly feel that I got nearly as much out of it as I do the longer segments. The other set from that menu I have tried is the Kundalini Superset which is about 22 minutes and a good overall workout. Usually with this DVD I do the 14-minute energy set on the main menu, which includes exercises that should be done every day according to the dvd, followed by one or two specific yoga quick fixes. The PMS quick fix really seemend to help me last month, and I also particularly like the ones for depression, digestion, and headaches. I think my favorite Ravi and Ana dvd so far is still Fat-free Yoga, but this is a close second. I also own Kundalini Yoga for Beginners and Beyond and Dance the Chakras -- all are wonderful and rotated regularly with this one.",1210723200,7,1005,4.239583333333333
2828212,5,B000PUAIOI,"I have about seven of Ravi & Ana's DVDs which I've been using for almost four years, and I LOVE Yoga Quick Fixes. It's probably my favorite of all, (and I love Warrior Workout, New/Improved Fat Free Yoga, Yoga Beauty Body, and Yoga Cleanse). With Yoga Quick Fixes, I particularly enjoy how you can customize your own workout, a feature I know they've updated using their matrix system on previously released DVDs. I've been doing Yoga Quick Fixes primarily in the morning (empty stomach, right after I wake up), and the customizing feature, in particular, is fantastically useful for establishing your own pre-work morning routines-- putting me in a truly positive frame of mind for starting my day.

One of the other things I enjoy most about Yoga Quick Fixes is how specific Ravi & Ana target various ailments, delineating how each exercise addresses specific issues. It's edifying to know how the digestive exercises also address deep fears, for example. I also love learning new variations for previously familiar exercises like grinding your stomach clockwise and counter clockwise using sipping breaths to address balancing stomach lining. Ironically, though the exercises may target particular issues, I find so many additional benefits in them. The memory cat/cow exercises are just fantastic, overall, promoting such well-being, results I feel during and after the exercise. I also love many of the headache exercises. All of the exercises just contribute to a much deeper and richer sense of physical and mental peace and well-being. The delete depression meditation is really cool, too.

All of Yoga Quick Fixes is great, including many of the Quick Workouts. Try it out. You can't be disappointed! I feel more gratified using this DVD than several of the others. And one of my favorites exercises in past DVDs is Eagle from the Improved Fat Free Yoga.",1210118400,11,1863,5.084967320261438

They include: PMS, depression, digestion, stress, asthma, headache, addiction, insomnia, anxiety. Also included, a warm up set, 3 meditiations, a section for strength and flexability, and a 22 minute Yoga ""super set"".  The total running time is about 3 hours. I loved the music too.",1207180800,6,406,4.970588235294118
2828214,5,B000PUAIOI,"Yoga Quick Fixes is the latest offering by Ana Brett and Ravi Singh  and I have to say, their production values keep getting better and better. The music on this one is great, and really helps to keep me engaged.

This is a very unique Yoga DVD. It is made up of numerous short chapters that can be arranged in any sequence you like.  I love the catchy titles of the chapters and the topics they address. Some examples are:""Delete Depression,""""Energy to Burn,"" ""Flexibility & Strength,"" ""Digestible You,"" ""Soothe Stress - Free Fatigue"" and more.  Even doing just 10 - 15 mintues of Kundalini Yoga can really make a difference in my day.

Also, Yoga Quick Fixes and the other one, Yoga House Call are huge!, packed with material, over 3 hours worth of each I think. They are worth every penny, a lot of 'Bang for your Buck' as they say. I plan to buy any new DVD's by Ana & Ravi as soon as they come out. They are simply the best.",1206230400,2,929,4.316091954022989

I own Navel Power and the Warrior Workout, which I actually purchased out of simple curiosity. Well it turned to be  the most fulfilling exercise I ever tried. Now these Yoga quik Fixes are actually delicious! I'm normaly healthy but no stranger to the aches and pains asociated to emotional ups and downs and stress, so believe me, these workouts will give the body what it realy needs, which is not always reps, going for the burn, ab blasting and stuff like that. When exhausted and burned out I believe these routines deliver what we all want: energy!

2828217,4,B000PUAIOI,"I enjoy this video alot.  It is actually the only yoga I have ever done.  It is easy enough for a beginner-even if you are a little out of shape.  You can use the modifications they give for more difficult poses.
  To start out with, I am 30 with a toddler.  In the last 2 yrs, I have been on bed rest for 8 months.  I also am an ex-smoker and need to lose some weight.  I have purchased this dvd to help with my sciatic nerve problems and cravings(each has a seperate section).  I enjoy these 2 sections very much.
  The section for addiction is very helpful as a past smoker.  I quit smoking 4 years ago and still crave it.  I have always missed the deep breating that I did as a smoker.  This is the only place I have found and connection.  Ana and Ravi suggest that smoking is ""dirty breathing"" and the breath is part of the high. They invite you to renew yourself with the real deep breathing free from all the bad toxins to reach a ""better high"".  I will be doing this anytime and anywhere when I crave a smoke.  Thanks guys!
  I feel like the addiction section will also help with my overeating.  There are serveral tecniques that they use that are wonderful.  Again after these are learned(very easy to do) you will be able to do them whenever and where ever you need to.
  As a christian, there are several areas that I am uncomfortable doing.  The sciatica and addiction are pretty much free from most all the chanting.  Other sections do have chanting.  I skip these sections or meditate on Jesus or scriptures. There is a book on amazon I have ordered; Yoga for Christians: A Christ-Centered Approach to Physical and Spiritual Health through Yoga by Susan Bordenkircher.  I am looking forward to using the ideas in this book.  I feel western medicine has so much to learn from the eastern way of life.  Yoga being one of them.  It just makes since to be proactive instead of reactive.
  I was not trying to offend anyone with this review, but give other people like myself and idea of what this dvd was like. I have ordered 2 other of there DVDs-one for me and one for my sister, so I reccomend this series of dvds.  Hope this review helps.",1198022400,27,2152,4.31328320802005

As other reviewers have mentioned, the music is fantastic and Ravi and Ana are excellent instructors. The poses are demonstrated by Ana while both Ravi and Ana alternatively do the voiceovers. Their voices are very soothing and they come across as genuine and very supportive.

One criticism I have is that Ravi and Ana do not indicate in what circumstances certain postures are contraindicated. For example, the shoulder stand, which is part of the So Long Sciatica and Energy to Burn set, should not be done while you are menstruating. Another downside is that they do not really cover proper form, which is important for those of us with bad posture!

I think this DVD is suitable for people of all levels (modifications are given for beginners), especially those who do not have the time to devote an hour to daily yoga practice. If you are having trouble deciding which Ravi-Ana DVD to purchase, this is the one I'd suggest. Highly recommended!",1196380800,41,1983,4.84070796460177

Yes I feel good doing it, especially the warm up, then PMS section and Sciatica and others BUT I don't feel the ""Quick Sets"" are that great. Why? Because they repeat many of the Warm Up exercises in the Quick Sets.  I did ""Kundalini Superset"" today and that is what happened. So during those times I have to do other exercises...which I don't mind because I know a lot of them and I know what makes me feel good...but why the repeat?
