4127981,5,B003IRUFCU,"""THE PATTY DUKE SHOW"" is an exceptional TV classic,which i'd encourage serious TV fans and viewers to invest in! the 1963-1966 ABC series from United Artists Television was an unforgettable classic,starring the Academy award winning actress,shortly after her award winning United Artists movie,""THE MIRACLE WORKER"" in 1962. playing Twins in this Family sitcom,was an amusing,but pleasant TV viewing each week on the ABC Network,until its demise by the end of the 1965-66 TV season. the series has been highly popular in syndication for the decades that past,and has not lost its charm,in the time that has past!  the DVD releases by Shout! Factory,has been First Class,both in its video quality,and its content! the series,which was created by Sidney Sheldon and William Asher,both,who went on to establish the TV classics,""I DREAM OF JEANNIE"" and ""BEWITCHED"" at Screen Gems. CBS had aired a 1999 reunion movie of the series,,but please spare yourselves the time,because like all reunions and remakes,this one
was absolutely HORRIBLE! Metro Goldwyn Mayer,another disaster in its own right,which owns the original TV series and huge library of great vintage TV,with
shows like ""SEA HUNT"",""HIGHWAY PATROL"",""RIPCORD"" and ""EVERGLADES"",did such an injustice to the PATTY DUKE special,,so please-spare yourselves the disappointment,and enjoy the original TV series,which is highly valuble,and worth the TV viewing!!",1423094400,,1409,5.64622641509434

4127999,4,B003IRUFCU,"Shows about teenagers usually only have about 3 good years.  This show was starting to wear thin.  I agree, to much Patty and no enough Cathy.  And I like Ross, to bad there wrent a few more episodes centered around him.  It was a good thing it ended.  I still love it and it's still far better then the crap on tv today, but most shows about teens that don't end after about year three, die a horrible death.  Example. My Three Sons  and Happy Days.  Dragged out for far to long.",1314403200,,480,4.141304347826087
4128000,3,B003IRUFCU,"This is the weakest season of ""The Patty Duke Show"".  Why?  Because the premise between two identical cousins is almost non-existent.  Cathy is relegated to the background in most of the episodes and she is not even seen in some.  Personally I liked the character of Cathy much better than the hyper-active narcissistic Patty.  Patty isn't always like this but she can be pretty annoying.  Cathy keeps her grounded.  But Cathy is rarely seen in this season and I'm guessing that is why the ratings continued to slide and dropped out of the top 30.  There are some great episodes in here..like ""Do you Trust Your Daughter"", ""Poppo's Birthday"" but with most of the episodes centered on Patty and not on both characters, its hit or miss.  Patty Duke is always wonderful but she herself admitted in an interview that she liked the character of Cathy much more than Patty.  I agree with her.  But if you like Patty Lane then this is the season for you.  For me, its a disappointing season but still better than any of the television that is out there today.",1311206400,6,1052,4.596774193548387
4128001,4,B003IRUFCU,"I loved the Patty Duke Show and even though the third season I felt is a little less than the previous two seasons, I find that I am enjoying this show as well. I liked the fact that the first two shows were based in New York City and even though the third season purports this, it is in fact done in California with some generic New York scenes added. It is still a good show and I'm glad to own it.",1297641600,2,400,3.8902439024390243

this has to be the funniest show out there.",1294185600,2,98,3.95
4128003,4,B003IRUFCU,"Apart from two episodes the third season is not as funny or entertaining. What happened to Cathy's and Patty's hair? And since when did the Lanes live in a McMansion? Cathy doesn't get much of a look-in in this series and Natalie's trying to be an aging sex symbol. Boring William Schallert gets to play his own identical cousin, and he plays it badly. Patty and Cathy deserved better scripts.",1288483200,,393,4.628571428571429
4128004,5,B003IRUFCU,"i love this show, Patty Duke in my own opinion is a very good actress.  She was Excellent in this Show, especially when she had a Duel Role to Play.",1285804800,2,148,3.933333333333333
4128005,5,B003IRUFCU,"Well, this had to the be the last season of Patty Duke, because there's no way she could have gone on playing a high school student, she's definitely looking like a full adult here.  But I've never seen the Reunion Movie, and I have to say it's the best I've seen that reunites an old cast.  Still Rockin' in Brooklyn Heights is superb--the whole cast captures the spirit and flavor of the original, and they used some interspersed old footage to good effect.  I wouldn't rate the third season quite as high as the second, but it's still excellent, and as I said--the Reunion Movie makes the whole package worth the price of admission.",1285286400,4,635,4.552631578947368
4128006,4,B003IRUFCU,"I loved all the seasons of ""The Patty Duke Show"" and all of the transfers are great with crisp, clear images and the extras given.
The only thing I greatly miss is the announcer saying ""The Patty Duke Show brought to you by....Clairol."" You can see the opening credits were faded out right before the announcer would say this and I used to rememmber hearing it on the syndicated re-runs except they'd cut out the sponsers name.  The Shout Factory could have done what CBS/Paramount did with ""The Lucy Show"" (seasons one and two) and give us an option to watch in Vintage or Normal format.  My only gripe.",1285113600,2,604,4.532110091743119
4128007,5,B003IRUFCU,I'm glad all 3 seasons have been released on DVD now. I just wish the sets included the original commercials.,1283904000,2,109,4.5
4128008,5,B003IRUFCU,"The third season of ""The Patty Duke Show"" marked a few noticeable changes from the first two.

The show's production began in New York in 1963, rather than L.A., because labour laws for child actors were not as strict in NYC as on the Coast, allowing the producers to use Duke on-camera for more hours per day.

When Patty Duke turned 18, these rules no longer applied so the decision to move production to Los Angeles was carried through.

Due to the move, The Lanes' get new digs this season. While their Brooklyn Heights home will remain more prominent in viewers' memories, I liked the more modern surroundings of Season Three.

Another change in the show this season is that Cathy disappears into the woodwork for much of the season. Some viewers may complain that this was a mistake and deflated the entire premise of the show, but for those of us who found the Cathy character too much of a 'goody-two-shoes', the reprieve was a welcome change. Patty Lane was always the more fun, upbeat character of the two, and free of Cathy, this season is allowed much more interaction with Ross and the other characters, which makes for a slightly different, but still interesting and highly entertaining show.

The guest star quotient remains high as ever with memorable appearances by Troy Donahue, Frankie Avalon (in the episode from the opening credits where Patty gets her head stuck under the sink), James Brolin, Steve Franken, Dick Gautier, Judy Carne, Kathy Garver, Elvia Allman and even singer Kim ""Bette Davis Eyes"" Carnes in a small role.

While the series peak may have been in Season Two (the show produced nearly 40 episodes each of its first two seasons), these episodes still hold up and are as enjoyable as those that came before them.

It would have been interesting to see the series continue on into 1967 in color, just to witness how the show would have handled Patty experiencing the Flower Power movement, wearing love beads, mod outfits, and rocking out to Jefferson Airplane and The Doors. Who knows what wild musical guests they could have had in Season Four?

Aside from all 32 episodes, the 1999 TV reunion movie ""Still Rockin' in Brooklyn Heights"" is included. It's a nice bonus for completists, but it is kind of depressing to watch since everyone had aged 35 years. If the movie had been made about 15-20 years earlier, it may have been easier to take. Still, many fans will be delighted to have it included here. The more recent public servicements announcements for Social Security are also included.

I love the graphics and fonts used on the menus. They really evoke a retro mid-60s feel!

Back in 2009, it was nice surprise to learn Shout! Factory had acquired the DVD rights to this wonderful '60s series. They deserve kudos for bringing out the seasons in a timely manner, finishing the entire show in less than a year.

For anyone who loves the old black-and-white sitcoms of the early-mid '60s, this one is a must-have.",1280275200,11,2956,4.742690058479532
4128009,5,B003IRUFCU,"Sadly, as all good shows must come to an end, The Patty Duke Show's Season 3 turned out to be the last for the Lane Family. For the 1966-67 Season, NBC, ABC and CBS were all buying shows that were being filmed in color. The old black and white television shows were now a thing of the past and the networks were always competing for the top spots in the ratings for the biggest advertising sponsor's money. In it's first season, The Patty Duke Show was #18 in the top 30. In Season 2, Patty dropped to #28 and in Season 3, it was not in the top 30. The top 30 shows was where the big money was spent by the networks, and so when negotiations were being made for United Artists to produce Season 4 of The Patty Duke Show in color, they refused without more money from ABC, and of course ABC would not give more money for a show that slipped out of the top 30 shows.

In the sixties, ABC was always at the bottom of the list on the top 30 shows in the network ratings. They were lucky to have 4 or 5 shows in the top 30, where NBC always took the number one spot with Bonanza year after year, and CBS ruled with the greatest number of top 30 shows, including shows like Red Skelton, Andy Griffith, Lucy, Jackie Gleason and The Beverly Hillbillies. ABC didn't have the money that the other networks had, to keep successful shows for too long, when the prices became too high. Sadly, this is the case for The Patty Duke Show. ABC instead bought 2 new shows for very reasonable- That Girl and Batman. Batman was an instant hit with merchandising in every store. At this time, Bewitched and Lawrence Welk were ABC's biggest hits in the top 30, and this is where they spent their money for color film. Perhaps if The Patty Duke Show had been on CBS, it would have gone on for another season with better financial backing.

This last season of The Patty Duke Show starts off with a bang and ends very quietly. The first 3 shows have big guest stars Frankie Avalon, Troy Donahue and The Shindog Band from the popular Shindig Show. Patty sings I'm Henry The Eighth I Am, with the band. A few other guest stars are in some of the shows, but they are not big stars at this time, but under contract to other ABC shows, that would eventually propell them to future stardom, like James Brolin (Marcus Welby, M.D.), Kathy Garver (Family Affair) and Judy Carne (Love On A Rooftop and Laugh-In).

The show explained that cousins Patty and Cathy looked alike because their fathers were identical twins Martin and Kenneth Lane, but the look alikes never ceased to amaze the viewers, when Patty played her southern blonde cousin in season 2, and in this last season Patty plays her own daughter Patricia in a dream sequence. The buck teeth on the poor daughter Patricia are too funny for words! Patty can barely speak with them! In 2008, Patty Duke remains as the youngest child star to have her own television show in her own name, and it's just so nice that we have the last of this series finally on dvd to always enjoy!

The quality of the first 2 seasons is excellent. This is one of my childhood favourites and will be a welcome addition to our TV library.",1272067200,13,286,4.314814814814815

8397680,3,B003IRUFCU,"The 3rd and Final Season of this fabulous show is such a letdown.

First off, they switched the house and neighborhood they lived in.  I really liked the first season as I was born and raised in Brooklyn, and live not too far from Brooklyn heights.  The exterior shots around Brooklyn Heights and the promenade really fascinated me, seeing the area many many years before I would see it for myself.

Season 2 seemed to changed the exterior of the house. In season 1 when the front door was open, you see the fence of the promenade. Season 2 changed that and there was now a house across the street and a front gate to the Lane house.  But season 3, they're now in a sprawling hi-class neighborhood that does not look like any part of Brooklyn I have ever seen, and the exterior shots of the high school have palm trees. In Brooklyn?

But this isn't the worst part for me.  The shows in season 3 just lack that special ""something"" that was there in seasons 1 and 2. Part of it is the very different house they lived in, part of it was much less of Cathy, but the plots and situations for the most part were not as good as the first 2 seasons.

I understand that the show moved from New York to California near the end of the 2nd season, but season 3 just does not have that Brooklyn feel, like seasons 1 and 2 had.

I would never fault Miss Duke for this, she was always a professional who put her best foot forward in everything she did. It was the production teams that failed the show in season 3, and perhaps it's better that it was not renewed for a fourth season.  I watched seasons 1 and 2 continually over the last 3 weeks, and am near the middle of season 3, but I think I'll stop there. It's not enjoyable any more.",1501372800,,1724,4.196969696969697

8397688,5,B003IRUFCU,"Season three was wonderful. I was quite young when season three aired but I remembered some episodes, like the one about the kittens.
  If anyone says Patty Duke was a comedienne and not to their liking then they need to watch the episode Do You Trust Your Daughter? That episode was amazing. Not just from the standpoint of Patty, but from the standpoint of William Schallert as well. That is, for me, the best episode of the entire season three. Bravo.",1470268800,,454,4.592592592592593
