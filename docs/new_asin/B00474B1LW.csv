8417681,5,B00474B1LW,This is a great DVD by the late Liam Clancy live at The Olympia Theatre in Dublin (1992).  If you love Liam you can't go wrong with this DVD of his concert. His does 27 songs and one song is better than the other.  Grab this DVD before it goes out of existence.  There are not many concerts of Liam's that were recorded so get this one fast.,1426204800,,341,3.985294117647059
8417682,5,B00474B1LW,"Even though the last of the Clancy brothers have now passed on into Eternity, their special blend
of Irish folk songs lives on in their albums.  Tommy Makem joined them many times in their concerts,
also.  Look them up on You Tube, so you can see what I mean!!
