168734,3,0800139062,"But the jokes often fall shy of the mark. I mean really, how many intercourse and scatology gags can a person take in two hours? The novel was ribald, to say the least, but the cinmatic realization goes beyond necessary. I don't remember so many bodily functions in the novel. While this is the film's own particular problem, the movie does share some faults with the book, too - they're both overly long for the available subject matter, they're both a bit too wordy, and the subject that they share - whatever it is- is a little muddled.  On the plus side, good costumes and period reconstructions; good music. No doubt the director meant well, but his point seems to have got lost along the way.",994982400,3,698,4.5396825396825395
168735,4,0800139062,"Granted, THE ROAD TO WELLVILLE may not be one of my absolute favorites, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.  Considering some of the quasi-medical gadgets and assorted ""cures"" that are still being peddled to people today, this movie was quite refreshing.  While the scatological references might have been a bit too much, they nonetheless reflected the obsessions and fetishes of many health gurus of the period with surprising accuracy.  Although fiction, THE ROAD TO WELLVILLE was based a true story, which makes the whole tale a bit more disturbing - but also a bit more humorous.
NOTE: For those who saw the movie, the Texas town of Glen Rose might have had its own version of Dr. Spitzvogel in the person of one Dr. Milling, a ""magnetic rubbing"" practitioner who was gunned down by a female patient's husband - possibly out of jealousy.

168738,1,0800139062,"After enjoying T. Coraghessan Boyle's hilarious novel, I was extremely disappointed by this awful film version.  While the book's humor had at least some element of subtlety -- and the mannerisms and mores of  turn-of-the-century America provided humor on their own -- Alan Parker has  turned Boyle's story into an overly-broad, over-the-top farce.  The  cleverness of Boyle's writing is completely lost; what's left is some  usually-talented (or at least sometimes-talented) actors competing to see  who can ham it up the most.

168767,5,0800139062,"Despite a low IMDb rating (5.5), director Alan Parker's THE ROAD TO WELLVILLE (1994), is most definitely worth seeing. A movie that's bawdy in places and always witty, it's backed by Rachel Portman's amusing music score. Also has a great cast.

Anthony Hopkins portrays Dr. John Kellogg as a buck-toothed nut who ""cures"" his patients by various forms of torture, like yogurt enemas or surgical excision of intestinal ""kinks."" Dana Carvey is Kellogg's demented adopted son (all his dozen or more kids were adopted),

Matthew Broderick and Bridget Fonda are a couple with bedroom problems (plus Broderick can't keep food down), Camryn Manheim (from THE PRACTCE) is a real sex fiend, Colm Meaney's the quack who treats women patients by laying them, and Lara Flynn Boyle (of THE PRACTICE) is the woman Broderick gets involved with while his wife undergoes Meaney's upclose brand of therapy. By the way, Boyle looks bulimic in this film. When we see her naked body I'm sure it's some other woman's-- a composite shot.

Best of all is John Cusack, who's borrowed a grand from a maiden aunt and has come to Battle Creek hoping to duplicate Kellogg's successful Corn Flakes cereal with a knock-off brand of his own. His scenes with Carvey, who'll do anything to sabotage the ""father"" that was so cruel to him as a child, are some of the funniest in the film.

They try to set up a cereal factory in a filthy barn adjacent to a pig sty. Carvey's there to lend his last name to the product. A man is hired who supposedly baked corn flakes for Kellogg, but the stuff he turns out is ghastly; green or gray in color and so unappetizing even the pigs won't eat it.

At the Battle Creek Sanitarium (Wellville), people are dying of various causes: from electrocution in one of Kellogg's contraptions, of a heart attack or simply of starvation. Broderick realizes this but his wife is unconvinced, and now Dr. Kellogg intends to operate on Broderick to remove a portion of his intestine....",1367971200,6,1975,4.746355685131196

My son was eating oysters, and he said to his two sisters something like the wife character in Wellville, telling her sick husband while they were eating a meal, that the liquid in the oyster shell is pee.  When the server heard my son say that, she told us that she was actually in that movie at around age 10.  She was in the scene where they were in church singing and Kellogg's adopted son was expelling gas.  It was a quick scene and she told us that she laughed in that scene.

Its plot, based on a fictionalized version of Dr. Kellogg's Battle Creek Sanitarium, is uneven, goes too much for comedy slapstick, and has too many gratuitous references to sex, as well as unnecessary nudity.  This film could have been made with no overall difference to the final effect without the bare breasts and locker-room humor.  They probably threw this stuff in just to spice up an otherwise 'dog' of a movie.  However, perhaps because the flick is so bad it is good, like Plan 9 from Outer Space (well, nothing's THAT bad...), or perhaps the nostalgic atmosphere harkening to a simpler time when spas and Victorian health resorts actually fooled people into thinking they'd 'get healthy' by eating cardboard and drinking nasty-tasting mineral water (""it tastes so bad it has to be good!""), whatever the reason, I found this movie highly entertaining.  Who knew that of all things corn flakes were the source of a Victorian mini-economic-bubble?

The otherwise not-so-remarkable Alan Parker will almost certainly never top this rollicking masterpiece of situational absurdity. It is a particular variety of humor, to be sure, but to dismiss it as ""scatological"" is just blunder.

While consistently outrageous throughout, and potentially difficult to follow at times, owing to the dizzying number of parallel story lines and fast pace, the movie is an elaborate, blatant mockery of health/wellness zealotry, and especially vegetarianism.

Cusack is particularly excellent, and gives his funniest performance ever (yes, better than Better Off Dead), as do Carvey and Hopkins. There are so many precious scenes that no one who sees the movie will ever be able to forget, least of all Cusack's side-splitting anti-vegetarian tirade towards the movie's conclusion, the all-too-glib Englishman with a preference for electrified bathwater, or the Kellogg family's fiery, yogurt-covered reconciliation.

I feel pretty ripped off as this movie was 18 bucks, pretty expensive for a standard full screen DVD. What's odd is the movie doesn't seem to be released in the U.S. on DVD in widescreen.

168788,5,0800139062,"This is not a review based on the DVD as I own the VHS.  I will more then likely order the DVD in the near future.

The movie is based on the happenings of the Battle Creek sanitarium - a sort of 'health spa' for the elite.  Kellogg - a devout Seventh-Day Adventist - believed that the key to health was a vegitarian diet, fresh air, exercise, enemas, and abstinence (unless one is trying to procreate).

While this film had a bit of flare added, it does a good job of demonstrating the activities that took place at the sanitarium. All of the 'treatments' shown in the movie were performed at the sanitarium as they were also performed by many doctors during the Victorian era... not exactly a time known for its medical ingenuity.

Very entertaining and hilarious.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes slightly off the wall comedy or simply laughing at crazy healthnut Victorians.

If you enjoy this film, you may want to check out the movie The Cat's Meow which is about the murder that happened in 1924 aboard William Randolf Hearst's private yaht.",1212969600,2,1068,4.589473684210526

168790,4,0800139062,"Based on the novel by T.C. Boyle, THE ROAD TO WELLVILLE is a delightful lark of a film that wickedly spoofs the health fads of the early 1900s--and in particular those set forth by Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, co-inventor of the famous Kellogg cornflake and proponet of numerous ""healthful"" ideas that seem calculated to make moderns squirm.

The film presents a triple story line.  William and Eleanor Lightbody (Matthew Broderick and Bridget Fonda) are a young married couple in trouble: Eleanor has accidentally poisoned William and hopes a trip to Dr. Kellogg's sanitorium can set him right.  Charles Ossining (John Cusack) has come to Battle Creek in the hope of striking it rich by creating a breakfast ceral to cash in on America's fitness craze--only to find himself involved with various thieves and scoundrels.  These include George Kellogg (Dana Carvey), who seems to live to make the life of his adoptive father Dr. Kellogg (Anthony Hopkins) unmitigated hell.

The various stories are extremely entertaining as they intertwine--but most of the laughs come at Dr. Kellogg's expense as he advocates yogurt enemas, electric baths, and other bizarre treatments that seem to arise primarily from his idea that sex ""is the sewer drain of a healthy body.""  Patients are humiliated, harrassed, and haranged about their sex lives even as they remain largely ignorant of their own sexual natures, which was typical of many Americans in this era.  Much of it is crude, bad taste, bathroom humor--but it is expertly, hilariously handled.  Any one who can sit through THE ROAD TO WELLVILLE without hooting out loud doesn't simply lack a sense of humor: they're probably dead.

The performances are sharp, clever, and make the most of the various outlandish situations into the characters are forced.  Broderick carries the film with tremendous charm and Fonda follows suit, but the real acting awards go to Anthony Hopkins, Dana Carvey, and a supporting cast that includes outrageously funny performances by the likes of Camryn Manheim, Traci Lind, Colm Meaney, and John Neville.  The DVD has nothing in the way of bonus features and is, alas, only available in pan-and-scan, but don't let that stop you.  Laugh your way to health the Kellogg way!

168791,4,0800139062,"The Road to Wellville is a movie that's kinda slipped through the cracks.  It didn't play long at the theater(I actually took a date to this movie!), and the reviews weren't favorable.  Not alot of people know about this film, but those who do are split into two camps: Those who wish they hadn't heard of it and those who think it's hilarious.  I think the biggest problem with this movie is that it didn't attract any audience of any kind.  I mean, what crowd was this film directed towards?  A lot of the humor is very below the belt stuff consisting of endless enema/fart/poop, and sex humor.  Basically the kind of humor you would expect from an American Pie or Larry the Cable Guy kind of movie.  Needless to say this is a crowd that wouldn't get within ten feet of a film that was a period piece set at the turn of the century.  More high falootin filmgoers who like costume dramas and films set at the turn of the century probably wouldn't be too hot on the toilet humor.  So, who was it aimed at?  Apparently the small population of folks who like films set in the 19th century and get a chuckle out of massive amounts of yogurt being administered anally.  The plot is simple, consisting of a married couple going to John Kellog's wacky health spa and being subjected to his insane philosophies and bowel obsessions, and ridiculous and pointless contraptions and ""cures""(one of my favorites consists of a vertical wooden pole, fixed with either rubber or leather straps, that rotates around and seemingly has no other purpose than to slap you silly.  Broderick is pretty funny as he walks around the pole covering his face as he's slapped by the contraption).  Meanwhile, John Cusack is trying to get a cereal company up and running with a con man(Michael Lerner is great) and Kellog's son.  It turns into a case of Murphy's law.  Sex at the sanitarium is taboo and it's only a matter of time until a few folks succumb to their urges.  The arrival of Colm Meany as a nudist/vegeterian/free love advocate doesn't help.  To be honest, I'm not sure what the point actually is to this movie, but I find it very funny.  It's bizarre to see this many high profile actors engaging in such goofiness, especially Hopkins.  The film was directed by Alan Parker who's career has included many films very different from one another.  He did the excellent Midnight Express, the musicals Pink Floyd The Wall and Evita, Mississippi Burning, and the supernatural thriller Angel Heart(you know, the one where Robert Deniro plays the devil and Mickey Rourke has sex with Lisa Bonet with all the chicken blood dripping on them) to name a few.  Parker also wrote the script.  I've read the book and I must say that Parker really adapted from this pretty freely.  I don't know what his reasons were for so many changes and additions(the book is considerably less sexual), but I guess he had his reasons.  So, if there is indeed such a thing as intelligent or classy toilet humor, I guess this is the example.  I would certainly recommend it if you're looking for something a bit different, or just to see A-list actors doing stuff you probably won't ever see them doing again.",1192838400,4,3164,4.607142857142857
168792,5,0800139062,"If you have seen the A&E BIOGRAPHY THE KELLOGG BROTHERS,CORN FLAKES KINGS, then you will all the more appreciate the hilarity of THE ROAD TO WELLVILLE, a comedic but also very sobering look at the wealthy person's search for illness cures and the seemingly bizarre and revolutionary medical practices of Dr. John Kellogg ( a bucktoothed Anthony Hopkins in a rare comedic role!) of Battle Creek, Michigan. The late nineteenth century was  positively a time of ""anything goes"" fads that swept this country. The wealthy flocked to every new word on the wind. People wanted answers about life after death and medical cures for their ills (enter husband and wife played by Matthew Broderick and Bridget Fonda). Thus we come to the enigmatic John Kellogg whose Battle Creek Sanitarium became the Mecca for the upper classes to spend their money and brag that they were in on the latest craze; laughing cures, enemas,no meat, electrical shock, fresh air rest cures and all done in grand style and at exorbitant prices!

Kellogg founded the corn flake as the miracle food of his Sanitarium. This started a mad rush for other entrepreneurs to cash in on this new fad. Battle Creek became a nuthouse of self seekers seeking honest patrons waiting to be victimized.(Here enters a scheming John Cusack with excellent comic timing!)

THE ROAD TO WELLVILLE examines this odd piece of American history with great comic relief and accuracy. If the movie seems silly that is because  the whole Battle Creek craze WAS SILLY! It was full of eccentric and self absorbed people willing to try anything. This is nothing new as history is full of ""revolutionary thinkers"" who got some things right and got many things wrong! The unfortunate thing is that well meaning people got caught in the crossfire through blind trust.

This is a fascinating and very interesting,accurate and downright funny film. Who else but soundtrack composer great Rachel Portman could add her notes of genius to such a film of a quirky subject matter.

The plots all take place during the turn of the last century at Dr. Kellogg's health sanitarium in Battle Creek, Michigan.

My favorites in this movie were the good doctor who is a product of his time believing that only procreational sex is good, and any loss of bodily fluids by other means saps the body of strength. I was in lust at first sight with the character of Ms. Munse. She is one of the reasons this comedy is for adults only; The facial expressions of the young and grown-up character of George Kellogg Jr. and pigs refusing to eat the experimental cereal ""Perfo"" kept me laughing constantly. I also enjoyed the music score which ranged from classical to delightfully silly. (I keep replaying the ""Laughing Song"" in my head.)

Anthony Hopkins is good as always, outfitted with some fake buck teeth, playing the very eccentric Dr. John H. Kellogg. The movie as the book it is taken from is a very fictionalized version of the real life Dr. Kellogg and his vegetarian ""sanitarium"" at Battle Creek, Michigan. You may wonder why a movie about a vegetarian health spa in Michigan in the late 1800's needs to be rated R.  Trust me there is more than enough nudity and frank sexual and scatological talk to justify the rating. Many famous and familiar performers have parts in this movie including Bridget Fonda, Matthew Broderick, Camryn Manheim, Dana Carvey, and John Cusack. The costumes and sets are lovely but the movie doesn't seem to know where it is going and is not a must see unless you are a true fan of one or more of the actors.",1163894400,,920,4.508982035928144

I thought that Anthony Hopkins was wonderful as Dr. John Kellogg - what a fabulous accent and set of false teeth - I've never laughed at anything Hopkins did before, but this definitely made me laugh.

I haven't read the book on which this picture is based, so I don't have anything to compare it to. However, I don't mind nudity and I don't mind people talking about their bowels or their diets, so I don't have the complaints of some of the other posters here.  In fact, I can't really  think of any other film that has this one's theme of health-fads and their many oddball incarnations.  Really, truly oddball.  Seeing Colm Meany (Chief O'Brien from Star Trek) doing god-knows-what to himself while watching some German doctor do god-knows-what to Briget Fonda and Camryn Mannheim was sort of a shocker, though.  Luckily, they were behind some bushes.  Made me wonder what Keiko would think.  But I'm mixing my pictures, here.

The movie features excellent performances from a talented ensemble cast - I particularly enjoyed Anthony Hopkin's rendition of the eccentric, self righteous Dr. John Kellogg, and Matthew Broderick's terminally bewildered Will Lightbody.  Lightbody's many encounters with the San's crackpot medical devices are great fun and reveal Broderick's talent as a physical comedian.

The production design is outstanding and the director has a real sympathy for the quirky elegance of this period of American history.  The luxurious lakeside San complex, with its many gymnasia, lecture halls, dining rooms and boudoirs, is almost a character in itself.

The film is full of crude humor as well as some nice gratuitous nudity, so the buyer should beware if these things offend him / her.

The film is set in 1903, the year the Battle Creek Health Sanitarium was burned to the ground.  The building I work in now (nowadays the Battle Creek Federal Center) used to be the 2nd Health Sanitarium, and it was built on the very spot where the original burned down.

Much of the depiction of what went on is quite authentic, from Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of the highy eccentric Dr. J.H. Kellogg to the marvelous ""health"" contraptions that he concocted for his patients.  A few of these machines are still on display in the history room of the Federal Center.

The turn of the century was a dynamic time in the cereal industry.  There were nearly 100 cereal companies in Battle Creek (admittedly most were very small) and quite a few shady characters trying to turn a buck - such as the one in the film depicted by John Cusack.

I think it would be less forgiving if I had watched the movie first, then read the book, but the inconsistencies in the movie vs. the text are so blaring that I just lost all interest in the movie.
The screenwriter took many liberties with the text to make this movie a more ""adult"" film, and I found this really disheartening since this is not what T.C. Boyle intended it to be.  I'm not against ""adult"" movies (i.e. nudity), but there a few things that occur in the movie that do not occur in the book at all.
The ending of the movie was to most ""let's tie this up real quick-like"" ending I've seen in awhile, and in fact, the ending (where all the main characters meet to watch the ""san"" burn down and then slowly walk away) didn't even happen like that.

168811,3,0800139062,"The Road to Wellville (Alan Parker, 1994)
I have thought for years that the novel upon which The Road to Wellville was based was written by the loathsome Garrison Keillor. Well, my copy showed up in the mail the other day, and I found out the novel was written by the far more easily-digested T. Coraghessan Boyle, so I decided I wouldn't exile the wife to the living room to watch this alone as I had planned.
What a horrible mistake.
The Road to Wellville chronicles, supposedly, the doings of a number of folks in the late nineteenth-century, all presided over by cornflake inventor John Harvey Kellogg (Anthony Hopkins). The story centers, if there can be said to be a center, around the Lightbodies, Eleanor (Bridget Fonda) and Will (Matthew Broderick), who come to Kellogg's sanitarium in order to recover from an unspecified disease of Will's (his wife confides in someone later what it is, and it's something of a major plot point). Also weaving through the tale is that of Charles Ossining (John Cusack), who gets involved with Kellogg's outcast adopted son George (Dana Carvey) and a crook named Bender (Michael Lerner, the ""lost another loan to Ditech!"" guy). And we haven't even begun to cover the principal actors yet, much less the cameos.
You may already be able to see where I'm going with this. If so, feel free to skip to the end of the review.
I've always considered Alan Parker an inconsistent director, but while mulling this travesty of a film over, I realized why. The movies he made early in his career that worked so very well (Midnight Express, Fame, The Wall, etc.) are movies where a lot of stuff is going on, and the viewer is being bombarded by stuff from every direction at all times. That's how the movies are written, and they succeed very well.
The movies he's made since then have had scripts that are more focused (or, in the case of The Road to Wellville, were in desperate need of more focus), but Parker is still using the same technique. And we're still getting bombarded when we require focus. Simply put, there's too much going on in any two hours of Alan Parker celluloid, and whether or not it works has to do with the material rather than the director or the actors. After all, Parker has a history of getting fantastic actors to work on his films (perhaps another thing; in every movie Parker made until Birdy, he was working with a cast of unknowns. Starting with Mississippi Burning, he started getting the A-list) and do things that could very well destroy their careers. I'm amazed that, after this mess, Hopkins, Broderick, Cusack, and a number of others survived with their careers intact.
Yes, this is a mess. Provides a few good one-liners here and there, but is basically the grown-up version of the unfunny teen sex comedy (and I can never say that without saying ""American Pie and its sequels are not funny, and if you think they are, you're wrong""). Will probably be enjoyed by those who thought Scary Movie was a laff riot. Everyone else can safely stay away without feeling like they've missed anything. **",1074038400,7,3066,4.67962962962963

168814,3,0800139062,"It's off-beat, and full of tongue-in-cheek humor, and I'd consider it more 'adult-oriented'...  but it's funny. I've seen the editied version on TV, and decided to buy the 'full' version...  I'm glad I did.
Note: You'll like it if you have a slightly twisted sense of humor.",1039305600,6,274,4.808510638297872
168815,2,0800139062,"A friend I really respect showed me this film.  I can see how a bright person may like the film: it is a look at a semi-interesting topic, the wellness cults of Kellog's day, and in the right hands could have been an interesting commentary on health nazis of today.  Instead the film becomes a scatological nightmare, with incredibly uneven pacing and confused plot(s) that end in a very dissapointing ending.  The performances range from mildly interesting (Hopkins as Kellog) to pathetic (Dana Carvey as Kellogs adopted ne'er do well son).  If you like endless poop jokes, the film is for you.  If you think fanantics are wacky you'll like it too.  Then again, even if you fit in the above categories you probably still will not like this flop.",1038182400,2,746,4.7
168816,4,0800139062,"Quite simply, this movie is hysterically funny.  Well written, evenly paced and contains one of the most catchy soundtracks ever recorded.  Chances are, if you're looking at this page for the DVD, you've seen the movie.  If not, you can read the other reviews for the particulars because I'm going to focus on the technical aspects of the DVD.  Besides, this is my second-favorite movie of all time, so any attempt to review the plot would be extremely biased and I know this movie isn't everyone's cup of tea.
First of all, the movie itself looks beautiful.  They did a great job on the digital transfer... the compression isn't all that noticeable and everything is crisp and clear.  Audio is par for the course.  Nothing too special here, but nothing lacking.
However, one question begs to be asked: why, in these days of ""Enhanced for 16:9 televisions,"" is a DVD being released containing ONLY a full screen version?  The fact that they have ""Full Screen Presentation"" bulleted as a special feature shows just how far Columbia/Tristar missed the boat.  The lack of widescreen is the only reason I've deducted a star from my rating.  As for the other special features, don't be fooled by the ""Bonus Trailers,"" which are all for other movies.
Should you get the DVD?  Certainly!  If you love this movie, you'll enjoy watching it with a clean digital picture (especially if you've had the tape for years and it's getting worn out.)  But if you've been waiting all these years for a widescreen version, you're going to have to keep waiting.  This DVD can only be described as a visual and audio upgrade from the videotape, but not a definitive version of the film.",1032220800,26,1664,4.732638888888889
168817,4,0800139062,"The film itself is hilariously funny, for those who have an open mind and heart on the subject of body functions.  However -- beware!  This DVD boasts as one of its ""special features"" the fact that it's a FULL SCREEN version, not a letterboxed version.  I doubt there will ever be another DVD edition, so pick it up, anyway.  The film wasn't shot in 'scope, so it's hard to tell how much you're missing -- either you're losing a small amount from the sides, or you're actually gaining a little on the top and bottom.  Anyway, a five-star feature goes down to four because of the unwise choice of a ""full screen"" presentation.",1031702400,11,625,4.495575221238938
168818,4,0800139062,"This movie is a ribald and hilarious send-up of late nineteenth century ideas regarding health and how to maintain it.  The unrelenting focus on exercise, clean bowels, vegetarianism, and holier-than-thou dogma propagators like Hopkins' Dr. Kellogg are eerily mirrored by today's focus on exercise, fiber, phytochemicals, and the ""infomercial experts"" propagating the diet and exercise culture of late-night cable TV. Watch this movie and think of it as the start of a great national industry.  And eat a pork chop while you do it.",1027900800,5,531,5.309523809523809

168820,1,0800139062,"This movie looked really great when I saw it in the video rental store.  It had a great cast and seemed like a great plot too.  Well, apparently a great cast can't save an awful film.  All the movie contained was people getting enemas, people talking about enemas, and people trying to be celebant.  I don't reccomend this movie, and trust me, no matter how good it may looks, ""The Road to Wellville"" is very bad. Don't waste you time or money.",1026345600,2,444,4.378048780487805
168821,2,0800139062,"'Road To Wellville' is possibly one of the biggest misfires of recent years.  It charts the later years of Dr. Kellogs (Hopkins) and his health spa, visited by unhappy couple Broderick and Fonda alongside the misadventures of would-be tycoon Cusack.  Just imagine a period comedy with plenty of farcical moments and crude jokes about enemas.
With such a fine cast, a person would be forgiven for having high expectations of this movie.  However, about ten minutes in you know exactly what you've got in store, basically a juvenile comedy where any moments of depth (such as the subplot involving Kellog's children) seem pointless.  The main problem is that the audience who the humour is aimed at aren't the typical audience who would want to see a period piece.
Still, there's still a few points of interest, although this is nearly all in the exceptional performances all round.  Plus there's a certain novelty in seeing Hopkins play the eccentric rather than his more chilling roles that he is better known for.",1026086400,2,1014,4.9411764705882355
168822,5,0800139062,"If you like your movies to be a series of throughly masticated one liners, then the ""Road to Wellville"" is not for you.  If you are looking for a movie that has incredible depth of history, and understanding of how the wealthy people tried to buy their way to good health and fitness, with a light touch of humor, than this is a movie for you.  ""The Road to Wellville"" is like going fishing.  Patience and sublety are the rules of the day when absorbing the lessons in this movie.  Are rich people really this stupid?  Will some people pay ANY price for good health?  The answers in this movie are YES!  Bottom line, if you are a lowbrow, you will definetly NOT like this movie.  And, in order to get the full effect, you must watch it more than once.
I grew up no more than 25 miles from Battle Creek, and went to a school that was built and paid for by the Kellogg foundation.  The commitment that the Kellogg family has made to West Michigan life is enormous.  Dr. Kellogg and his Sanitarium in Battle Creek was long gone by the time I was born, but there are many stories that still float around about the ""San"".  I am glad that someone actually had the foresight to record it for future posterity.",1010102400,6,1202,4.297777777777778
