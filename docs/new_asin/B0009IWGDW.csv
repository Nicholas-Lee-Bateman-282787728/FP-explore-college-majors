8061505,5,B0009IWGDW,I love the Beverly Hillbillies and the shows are great for the entire family...unlike the new shows on television. I wish they had the theme song at that start of the episodes instead of the banjo music only...but they are still great fun.,1400112000,,239,4.5813953488372094
8061506,1,B0009IWGDW,"All episodes of the first season and many episodes of the second season are in the public domain because CBS bought the rights to the series shortly after its cancellation and forgot(!) to renew their copyrights.

As a result, these episodes have been unofficially released on DVD by many low-budget labels and rerun on budget networks on 16mm prints. It is very obvious that this DVD set was made from the inferior 16mm prints. There are annoying scratches, lines and skips throughout every episode.

The original theme music has also been replaced by hokey-sounding generic music due to copyright issues. After watching 3 or 4 episodes in a row, this music will really grate on your nerves.

Save your hard earned money and watch for Paramount/Viacom to eventually release the ""official"" versions.",1224028800,13,799,5.037878787878788
