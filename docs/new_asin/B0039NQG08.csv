8392118,4,B0039NQG08,"While this video does not include a verbatim presentation of the AKC breed standard, it is an excellent resource for anyone interested in learning about akita conformation.  Particularly helpful, this video provides a comparison between akitas which do meet standards to those which do not meet the standard.  A video analysis of gait and movement, which is one of the highlights of this video, is so much more helpful than books on the subject.

The Standard presented in this video is 1972. Thus, it is curious that the advertisement here announces that this is a brand new video. There have been some changes in the Akita breed standard.  The most current breed standard was made effective July 1, 2009, a copy of which can be found on the Akita Club of America website.",1287273600,,773,4.7894736842105265
