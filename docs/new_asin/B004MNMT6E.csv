Despite the burden, there is no sign of pressure as he plays the challenging role of a man without an identity with utmost ease. He uses his body language, mannerisms and expressions to create a man with no identity, gets your attention from the very first frame and manages to hold it till the end.  Despite being a semi-thriller, the film has romance as its core: the husband who goes against all odds to win back his wife; the wife's dilemma of whether she should choose the man she married or the one who broke her heart; and the ex-boyfriend who desperately hopes to revive his shattered relationship. The climax plays out skillfully between the trio, leading to an unpredictable end. Sandeep Patil's camera work is brilliant; the soundtrack with the opening track 'mera yahan hai kaun' is hauntingly raw and mesmerising.

Soch Lo is an honest effort. It's makers have taken the risk to be truly different and need to be applauded.",1300579200,,1017,4.707865168539326
