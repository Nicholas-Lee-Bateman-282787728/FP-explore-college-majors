6208046,5,B00HSVNV6O,I love this series! I do not get HBO and i am glad that i was able to purchase this-my daughters and I couldn't wait to get started!,1400889600,3,132,3.75
6208047,2,B00HSVNV6O,"After watching Season 3, I think I'm done with ""Girls"". Season 1 was great and very addicting, Season 2 was ok yet disappointing, and Season 3 just made me say WTF?! With each new episode I realized exactly how loathsome and pathetic Hannah, Marnie and Jessa truly are; refusing to learn from past mistakes yet acting like they're entitled to glamorous, charmed lives made possible by the hard work of others. The constant causing of drama just for the sake of getting attention is childish and so unappealing to watch that I was actually hoping one or all of them would get a serious ass kicking.  Surprisingly, Shoshanna and Adam, who's characters I used to hate most of all, have matured into responsible, goal-oriented and caring people, thus being the only reasons I made it through this season. They too have lost patience with the idiotic behavior of the others and seem to be distancing themselves from the group. Adam even tells Hannah bluntly that he will be temporarily moving in with Ray while preparing for his role in the play because ""The constant drama is too much of a distraction."" ""What do you mean drama?"",Hannah asks. ""It's just me."" Adam replies with annoyance, ""Exactly.""  I can't even imagine how much lower this show is going to try and go for Season 4 but I'm sure there will be the same formula for each episode: whining, someone loses a job, someone has unemotional sex, Hannah is naked, Jessa screws someone over and then they all go see someone singing in a club. Nope. I'm done. Yeah, the show makes me feel so much better about my own life, but when the characters and plots have gotten so unrealistically ridiculous it's time to stop watching.",1400544000,7,1676,4.697278911564626
6208048,5,B00HSVNV6O,"I love Girls because it's a show that pushes the limits of tv shows airing nowadays. The writing is perfection down to every sarcastic, rude and hilarious comment. The acting is brilliant and the characters are so different from everyone else in the show it's accurate. This season didn't have much darkness towards it which is what I liked about the first two seasons but every episode was gold in its own way. The story line is very relevant to how it is out there to many people close to the characters' age, their passions, the struggles, love and hate, selfishness, lust, desperation, loath and despair. We all look for something to hang on, we try to achieve greatness in everything or fail at life in the process. Our relationships with our friends and lovers surrounds us when we are trying to find ourselves and that's what Girls is all about. The humor is to die for and if you're looking for some Gossip Girl drama, sorry but this ain't for you.",1398988800,8,956,4.563953488372093
6208049,4,B00HSVNV6O,"Yes, this series is a very hip look at twenty something year old girls in New York. But it is actually a much deeper character driven piece about their lives. When I was their age everything centered around Manhattan. Now the young and stylish flock to Brooklyn, which provides a vivid backdrop for these stories. And though I am no longer a twenty five year old, and not a woman, this show, for me, gives a brilliant insight into the mind of one. The third season finds Hannah (brilliantly played and sometimes written by Lenah Dunham) living in domestic bliss with her intense boyfriend Adam. Their relationship is strained by the arrival of Adam's even crazier sister, Caroline. Hannah's career takes a turn when her publisher suddenly dies, leaving her e-book project in limbo and tied up in contract. She goes to work for GQ where another unique group comes into play. Her once best friend Marnie (Allison Williams) struggles with a seemingly final break-up with Charlie. She often falls flat on her face while busy redefining herself, and while vulnerable, she is hilarious to watch. Jessa calls finally out of the blue and in her selfish way insists that Hannah drive out to the middle of nowhere to pick her up she's been kicked out of rehab for fraternization. Hannah muses over if she is in fact old enough to even rent a car and is infuriated to find out that Jessamine could easily have taken the train. All the characters including Sosh (so funny) are working on fully developing themselves and learning that part of growing up is lowering one's expectations. This series strikes a good balance between the poignant and the comedic every season.",1393027200,8,1658,4.780487804878049
6208050,3,B00HSVNV6O,"I started watching the show ever since it aired and while there were times when I completely loathed Hannah's character and couldn't stand her and the things that she would say or do that would just make a person wonder why on earth would anyone in their own mind say/do that! Considering the show pretty much revolves around her, I came to accept her character over time, no judgment.

I understand many people have been either praising this show or bashing it with little middle ground in between. That alone could give you the sense that Girls is either a hit or a mess for most of the audience out there. For me it wasn't a horrid experience, more like a surprisingly pleasant one mainly because I started watching the show with less expectations and found it better than I had imagined or thought it would be. The first season was amazing, it was refreshing, dramatic but not overly so, the relationship between the characters felt genuine and sweet. Adam and Hannah were awkward and frustrating to watch at first but their romance grew on me by the time the season ended, it all made sense at the end. I couldn't care less for Marnie's relationship with Charlie but it wasn't that annoying to watch. The girls interaction within themselves and the outside world was interesting enough. I understand many people do not get the humour of this show as it's more dark and twisted but I have no issue or problems with it at all. I do find the show funny probably because this is my idea of what funny is?

Point is, season one was wonderful. Season two unfortunately was a step down from one. It was lacking the spark one had. It lacked the heart as well. The characters were acting outside of their nature. They felt like different people rather than the once we got introduced to at season one and thus just seemed distracted and uninteresting. That made it hard to watch but I finished watching it at the hopes it would get better.

I had hopes season three was going to make up for the disappointments of last season and so far so good however it still doesn't catch up to the first season. The reason I give it three stars, is because this season compared to the previous two is a bit dull and slow. Also, the focus seems to be on Hannah and the rest of the characters hardly if ever get screening time so we don't really get a closure on what's going on in their lives although they are considered to be in the spotlight as well. Of course there's a portion of time dedicated to the rest of the cast but it's hardly enough so they seem to be very much lost in the Background. Also, characters like Charlie and Elijah are completely erased from this season.

Hannah, this season is loathsome as usual. She's just a character that you get used to but at the same time cannot understand. I know that Lena Dunham is trying to portray how hard life might be to people post college. How not everyone knows what they want to be even if they have a degree. However, this thing with Hannah throwing around job opportunities like it's nothing season after season after season is getting repetitive and over the top. I would love to see Hannah be more responsible and hold a steady paying job for once longer than two weeks. We understand that she's ambitious and she's looking to be a successful writer, that's totally fine but she can still manage to hold a regular job that pays her well and support her while she's pursuing her dream. That would make more sense and would be more realistic even. It shows character development and shows she's more mature and is looking for security in her life.

Overall, I will continue to watch this series because although it has an unlikable main character and self absorbed minor characters, it does hold a sense of realism that other Tv shows lacked. For example, it is really refreshing and comforting to see that not everyone has a beach body, also that not everyone lives in a fancy apartment or a ten bedroom mansion. Not everyone has a well paying job or a hot boyfriend. I've seen many people complain about how the characters on this set are self absorbed and shallow. I think that everyone in their 20s has been self absorbed for at least a period in their life. Everyone is selfish, some less, some more and the age group of 20s is when people are at their most selfish time. I say this with confidence because I am 20 years old and I know a lot of people in my age group either boys or girls and the majority of them are oblivious to the first world problems and rarely if ever focus on anything that does not involve them in a way.

To me the struggles these characters go through of self discovery and what not finding their place in this world on their own. Separating themselves from their parents financially and finding an identity seem to be pretty much real and relatable. All I'm saying is it's nice to see a show about people who don't have it all together and aren't offered everything on a silver platter.",1392163200,6,4967,4.464757709251101
6208051,3,B00HSVNV6O,"While I really like the show, I find it to be a bore how she's nude in every episode. Lena Dunham recently said in an interview something along the lines of (while cruelly making fun of a reporter) ""If you don't like my body, that's your problem."" Well actually, I don't like seeing you naked, and it's not a problem for me.
Like I said, I like the show but constant graphic sex and nudity is not necessary. I'm not a prude whatsoever but I could go episodes without seeing it and not have the plot taken away from me.
Another problem I have with this season is that all the characters grow except for her! The others grow and change from their experiences for good and bad. She stays stagnant in the same self-absorbed, whiney, dependent way that she always has. It works for the show, unfortunately, but as the others seem to have a lot more going on they need to how a MUCH larger appearance in this season and I hope they do!
Lena Dunham is one of those people that I love to hate! Her character generally makes me sick and she's one of those friends I'd dumped along the way a long time ago, but that's probably why I watch the show! I love hating her while loving the other characters.
Give the show a try, but start with the first season, not the third.",1391212800,3,1260,4.254166666666666
6208052,1,B00HSVNV6O,"I couldn't believe how bad this show was. The people in it are boring, if not idiotic, it is perhaps the saddest reflection of our times that I have seen, second only to New Girl, at least that one is supposed to be slapstick",1390521600,6,225,4.136363636363637
6208053,5,B00HSVNV6O,"I am not a girl, this show isn't just for girls. This show is for everyone. I have watched this since the first episode aired, my girlfriend and I watch it together and we both enjoy it. People complain about the girls on the show being rich, white elitists, I don't see it that way. In fact Lena Dunham's character is usually pretty poor, having to ask her parents for money. And the rich girls on this show are kind of sad, and I think that's the point. You probably don't want to be any of these girls, you may not even want to be friends with any of them. But I'd certainly like to hang out with them because I do enjoy watching their lives unfold/fall apart. This show is essentially about the human condition, and how hard it can be to balance friendships and relationships with a partner or your parents or even coworkers. While I may not be thrilled with Hannah's choices throughout this season and especially the season finale, it fits her character and makes for great television. This maybe one of GIRLS strongest seasons, if not the strongest.

Season 3 picks up right about where we left season 2. Though due to creative differences between creator Lena Dunham and Christopher Abbott (who played Charlie in the last 2 seasons), his character has been written out of the show and we find out that he and Marnie (Allison Williams) had a bad break up. While Marnie picks up the pieces of her life after having moved in with her mother, Hannah (Lena Dunham) and Adam (Adam Driver) are back together and making a real go of it. Now they both live in Hannah's apartment together. Shoshanna (Zosia Mamet) continues to be fun loving and care free, having not been in touch with Ray (Alex Karpovsky) since they split last season. Ray now manages two coffee shops as he attempts to be more mature and grown up. Jessa (Jemima Kirke) disappeared last season only to reappear in a rather unlikely place, though not too unexpected. I always enjoy scenes when the girls are all together since they play off one another very well, and in episode 7 ""Beach House"" we get a very good dose of all 4 girls airing out their dirty laundry. Without ruining anything, one of my favorite characters makes a surprise appearance.

People complain about this show being too ""hipster"", complain about ""too much nudity"" (I don't believe in such nonsense, there is no such thing as ""too much nudity"" to me, maybe because I am a guy) and about there only being white people on this show. To me it sounds like people make opinions based off of having never seen the show, or just reading articles about it. I enjoy this show immensely, my girlfriend loves it, we love it. This show is smart, relevant, funny, true to life, has heart and meaning and purpose, just as art should. The characters are brilliantly written and brilliantly acted and the show is always entertaining. This show has everything you want out of television, and season 3, is just as great as the last 2.

6208084,3,B00HSVNV6O,"I was really impressed with season 1 and 2 and eagerly awaited more of Lena Dunham's unique style. I believe that she is pure magic from head to toe but this season seemed rushed. It's almost as if there were 2 great episodes stretched out to fill the space of an entire season.

Since I don't subscribe to Dish or Cable, I am forced to wait for the discs to be released. I'm hoping season 4 will be better than this one.

Lena, you're a fantastic writer with a great imagination! Take your time and write stories worth telling just like you did for seasons 1 and 2.",1424822400,2,566,4.231481481481482
6208085,4,B00HSVNV6O,"Unlikely HBO's other big hit, Game of Thrones, which started collapsing under it's own weight in it's 3rd season, Girls shows 'em how it's done by simply hitting it out of the park the third time out!  No self-conscious attempt to recapture the magic here.  TV doesn't get much better this, never resting on it's laurels, surprising and delighting all the time.  I came real close to going 5 stars here.  But unlike other Amazon reviewers I try to keep the rating system meaningful and not always going 5 star/1 star. But I'd give them that last star if they could reign in the occasional raunch just for raunch's sake only.  Sometimes the raunchy stuff is integral to the story and very funny, other times it's gratuitous. It's not nearly as much of a drain on the proceedings as on Game of Thrones, where you might as well get up and get a snack when they start going at it, but it gets old and dull fast and let's out just enough air to keep the show floating under the 5 star bar.  Sometimes less is more and although Lena Dunham is a great enough talent to be able walk that line of making a show that is consistently brilliant yet also consistently gutter-minded enough for HBO, I'd like to see what she'd be able to do within the limitations of network TV sometime.

I loved that girl up there and thought she was adorable and was intrigued.  She was Lena and the show was GIRLS.  I tried it and liked it.  I think it is an honest show and shows people warts and all.  I think SOME people don't like it because it is like looking in a mirror, and people don't like what they see.

8635614,5,B00HSVNV6O,"For those who must live without cable, finally finding this AMAZING series on dvd is literally a GodSend. I am not kidding. Especially for anyone who: a. Always wanted to be a successful writer living in the Big Apple and b. Having a Wonderful and not so Wonderful time of living in the Big Apple.

I ADORE these women and the relationship merry-go-round they are riding on.

The Beach House episode is a true classic, especially the ""honesty"" segment with Shoshanna as Jemma puts it, ""going sane"" for once, and then they all tell each other exactly what they think of one another. And poor Elijah tells his new partner he loves him, only to experience the cold heartbreaking reality, that his partner totally does not even come close to loving him back.

Adam Driver is stellar as Hannah's go-to Mister Man, and then he finally gets a decent acting gig and their togetherness has to be re-defined.

You can climb into these episodes and lose your worries and cares for just a little while, and just almost pretend that maybe just maybe these people could almost be your friends.
So incredibly lovely. Many giant thanks to Lena Dunham and Judd Apatow and Jenni Konner for this brilliant series!",1484352000,,1194,4.698564593301436
