The dash provides real time information to dial in your workout including cadence, heart rate and resistance. Plus other features of the dash keeps the video interesting, informative and a lot of fun! This is a short video that teaches you the components of the dash and how to use it.

8375949,5,B002ODBLUE,"This was my first (cycling videos online) dvd. In fact it might have been my first cycling/training specific dvd period. I love Paul's videos because they are obviously made by someone who loves cycling. I am not a techy guy by nature but I have come to appreciate everything that is on the dashboard of these dvds. In fact it is fun to see how they have evolved over the years. This dvd in paticular, if you follow the gear chart and the rpm gauge when you get to the end you really feel like you have just climbed a mountain. I enjoy the 3 soundtracks that are offered sometimes I enjoy the conversations, they help break up the monotony and other times I just put my head down and zone out to the music. I own at least 8 of Paul's videos and use them all equally. There are other bike dvds out there and some are good. I have never been disappointed with any of the (cycling videos online) these are simply the real deal. If your not sweating then you are not doing it right.",1417392000,,978,4.207446808510638

8375951,5,B002ODBLUE,"I bought this for training indoors this winter and love it. I'm not a very good climber (yet!) and this pushes me to improve in that area.  The visuals are good and make you feel like you're really there.  The superimposed data helps you understand what gearing, level of effort, heartrate, and level of incline is appropriate.",1347494400,,327,4.719298245614035
8375952,3,B002ODBLUE,"This is my second ""Behind the Bars with Paul"" virtual reality video and probably my last. Previous  purchase was the Evergreen/Red Rock virtual ride.  I give Paul Gallas and his production team a lot of credit for the realistic road feel of the video, but the drawbacks outweight the plusses in my view.  Here's why:

1. The video dashboard that's on display during the ride is information and sensory overload. 15 minutes into the ride and my eyes are wandering all over the screen to this or that little kernel of data - rolling course map, elevation, crank rpms, speed, level of perceived exertion, gear ratio (I may have missed two or three other gauges).  I play this on a 42"" plasma tv and ride my trainer about six feet away from the screen. The data boxes are not sharp at all. Not illegible exactly, but difficult to pick up quickly and make sense of. I can't imagine trying to pick up the data blocks on a smaller tv or computer screen.

2.  I found it difficult to get my bearings from the start of the disc until about 15 minutes into the workout when the ride actually begins.  Before that point, you're given an explanation of what all the on-screen gauges and meters mean. I've covered just how useful (or not useful) those are in point 1.  Then you get snippets of other rides (Evergreen Colorado and another Rocky Mountain foothills ride  in this case).  You're just thrown into these rides with the on screen rider turning the cranks at a high cadence.  If you're like me and, on the second or third viewing, would rather skip the intro, there's no way to skip ahead to the start of the ""real"" ride.  Can't do it by searching chapters as you can with a movie video. You just have to fast forward. Clunky and tedious.

3.  Probably the main flaw in this video series for me is that there's no time display on the screen -- neither running/elapsed time, nor a countdown. I would have preferred one or the other, but maybe it was just a matter of the screen being jammed with so much other data that there wasn't room.

4. You may be on the ride with Paul, but Paul has got nothing to say to you. I got these ""Riding with Paul"" videos in order to try something different from Coach Troy Jacobsen's ""Spinervals"" training series. I've got a half dozen of his in-studio workout DVDs and two of his on the road videos -- Tucson/Saguaro/Mount Lemmon and the Tempe Tri Course.  It sounds corny, I know, but Troy's approach in his virtual ride videos makes me feel like I'm taking an up tempo ride with an engaging and encouraging coach. Think I'll stick with Coach Troy in the future.",1336089600,5,2593,4.4482029598308666
8375953,5,B002ODBLUE,I am enjoying this set so much! I haven't made it to disc #4 yet - but I am having fun getting there! I love the narration and pointers along the way! Makes an inside workout so much more fun!,1328659200,,192,3.825
8375954,5,B002ODBLUE,"I hold you folks completely responsible for my biking addiction.

I am a 66 year old criminal defense attorney and Law Professor in the Chicago Metropolitan area. Though we don't have any mountains (and only a few hills) we do have some impressive-for-the-area Rails to Trails pathways, but lousy weather winters. However, I have a son who has a mountain guide ,skiing, climbing business in Durango, Colorado (Klingmountainguides.com) whom I try to visit at least a couple of time /year. His wife is the HR person at Durango Purgatory Ski Resort. Of passing interest is that when my son Josh, now 30, was 15 he and a group of kids biked from Virginia to Los Angeles which is where we discovered Durango en route.

Through a number of trips to Durango and surrounding areas I began looking on line for biking videos in the region and found you folks. The rest is history. I have either purchased or been given as presents ""Indian to Girdwood,"" ""Evergreen to Red Rocks,"" ""E Rock Rocks,"" ""Training to Climb, Rattlesnake Bite,"" ""Laying Down the Hammer,"" ""Training to Endure, Front Range...."" and ""Bay Area Backroads."" I assure you my orders for the rest of your Colorado and the High Country videos are only a paycheck away.

I hold you completely responsible for my significant diversion from work and family, spending extra money for the videos, not to mention phenomenally better emotional and physical health and outlook and enjoyment of life in an otherwise flat topographically boring environment. I really appreciate your attention to detail, especially enjoy the narrated videos, and look forward to a long relationship. Have a great year.",1327276800,,1643,4.967272727272727

8375956,5,B002ODBLUE,"We are totally hooked on Paul's cycling videos and now own about seven of them.  They are a great way to get in a hard ride during the winter, or (in the case of West Texas) when it's so windy that riding outside is miserable.  These videos are infinitely better, and way more fun, than spinning videos.  You actually do feel like you are out on the road doing the ride and by using the information provided on the screen you ARE going to get a great workout.  If you are sweating by the end of the BtBoP videos, you aren't using the graphics and challenging yourself.  There's no one screaming at you to push - it's all up to you.  I keep a log of my rides, both outdoors and on the trainer, and I have definitely improved over the course winter by using Paul's cycling videos.

The scenery in this one is great!  Oh yeah - and it will kick your butt and have your legs screaming by the time you reach the summit.

Thanks for another great ride, Paul!",1268697600,,952,4.186813186813187
8375957,5,B002ODBLUE,"I have purchased several of the virtual reality videos from ""Behind the Bars with Paul"" and this is by far the ""Very Best Virtual Trainer Workout Video Ever"".  The workout is plenty long enough and the heart and legs feel it big time.  The virtual reality of the ride brings you into the ride and you can forget you are not actually out on the road.  If you use the heads up information that is supplied on the screen and keep it honest, this workout will kick your butt.  This video climbs until your legs fall off and your heart is pounding out of your chest.  I would highly recommend any of Paul's videos wanting a great way to workout or just get in some indoor miles.",1261526400,2,673,4.267716535433071
8375958,5,B002ODBLUE,"I've bought just about every one of this cycling video series.  I train mostly on a stationary trainer for Triathlons.  Kind of freaked out of traveling on the road after being hit by cars and getting major damage (broken bones, road rash, lacerations, etc) from inattentive and impaired car drivers.  These videos give me a feeling of being on the road without the danger.  Plus, they are darn fun to do and the training time goes by really quick.",1261440000,3,448,4.632911392405063
