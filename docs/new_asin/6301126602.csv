7809584,1,6301126602,"The item I paid for never showed up. It's a good thing that the seller didn't show up at my front door to steal my money. Things would have been alot different.
This is the second review I've done about this, I guess Amazon.com doesn't even read them. The seller is from New York, so I guess it's ok to steal from people there.
Here in Oregon this kind of crap is not seen that much.",1245974400,,383,4.052631578947368
7809585,3,6301126602,"I'm a little disappointed that the DVD had less material than the VHS tape I used to own. I bought the DVD because I thought they'd put more content on it, not less. They left a whole lot of wasted space. I'm not happy.",1182816000,3,219,4.0
7809586,5,6301126602,"Don't let the title fool you, in this HBO Comedy Showcase everything went right.  All the comedians were hilarious albeit short.  If only they were able to do full sets, but I guess that's what a great show leaves you with-always wanting more.  One thing this show made me realize is that as a society we've become entirely too sensitive.  A few of the topics are a bit off kilter, but at that day and age it was all fair game and still entirely hilarious.",1164931200,2,456,4.329411764705882
7809587,4,6301126602,"Rodney Dangerfield played host to seven comedians, filmed live at Dangerfield's nightclub in New York City. Lenny Clarke, who co-starred with Dennis Leary in the TV series The Job, goes over well with the crowd. The notorious Andrew Dice Clay has never been funnier, especially when he does his off-color nursery rhymes. Dom Irrera, who played a prop comedian in an episode of Seinfeld, teaches Italians the finer points of being Italian. Rodney always had an eye for comedic talent, and all of the stand-up comedians in this video range from very funny to absolutely hilarious.",1021680000,3,578,5.03125
