855380,2,6304362498,"I have read 1984 the book several times and I just finished watching the movie. In my opinion the movie left much to be desired. At least it didn't gang-rape the book -- it followed the plot and even the ending -- but the  movie left too many things out and I get the impression that unless you've  read the book you wouldn't be able to understand it. You can't really make  a decent movie out of 1984 anyway. I do like the movie for being able to  capture the setting of Oceania so well, though, that's why I give it two  stars not one.",921456000,2,537,4.076190476190476
855381,5,6304362498,"This movie, a favorite of mine, is one of the best film adaptations of a novel I've ever seen. While a film of roughly two hours can only hope to scratch the surface of a novel as complex as ""1984"", this movie  provides a good distillation of the book. It's all here, from the book's  oppressive atmosphere of hopelessness and paranoia, to its timeless theme  of the individual against the system. 1984 is a visually stunning movie you  won't want to miss, particularly if you liked the book. (WARNING: Several  people I know who hadn't read the book prior to seeing the movie found it  confusing and boring, so if you haven't read the book yet, you may want to  put off watching the movie until you've done so.)

The acting is first  rate. John Hurt does an excellent job as the protagonist, Winston Smith  (?), who wages a futile yet heroic battle against Big Brother. And Richard  Burton is masterful as the cold, sadistic party leader who interrogates and  eventually breaks Winston.  (Incidentally, this was Richard Burton's last  film role, and the movie is dedicated to his memory.)

The music, composed  in part by the Eurythmics (get the soundtrack; it's some of their best  work), is haunting, and stays with you long after viewing the movie  (Juuulllliiiiiaaaaa.....).

One interesting note: the movie was filmed in  the year 1984, in and around London, the exact time period and setting of  the novel.

Don't miss this movie. It's a modern classic!

855560,2,6304362498,"Given that so much of Orwell's novel is internalized and philosophical, one can see how it might be a hard one to bring to the screen. But this version sinks itself by making bad decisions from the start, coming off like a very long and tedious music video. Few of the points Orwell made about totalitarianism and the complicity-or-resistance of the individual citizen come through in this bleak, blank rendition. Winston and Julia's dangerous affair is reduced to a few eye-catching but soulless nude scenes, and the tense politics of it are bleached out. Ditto Winston's terrified love-hate relationship with O'Brien. For an adaptation of one of the most important novel-of-ideas of the 20th century, it's curiously clueless. Yeah, it looks good, in its music video way, and John Hurt could have made a perfect Winston Smith in a better movie. But really, as no doubt others have said, Brazil is a better 1984 than this 1984. If you've read the book, stick with that. And if not, why not?",1523318400,,990,4.829411764705882

855728,4,6304362498,"If you truly want the full 1984 experience, I can't recommend the actual novel enough. While the film (more or less) gets the job done, there are some points either glanced over, or completely removed.
One point the film doesn't portray properly is the ultimate intention of the party, complete anihination of Oceania's humanity/empathy. In the novel, this point is presented more subtely, which makes me think the writters either didn't quite pick up on it, or just didn't have the time to include it in the script.
Another point of contention is how Winston's thoughts are vocalized. In the novel, this is handled primarily through inner dialogue from Winston, which does a good job saying exactly how he feels in a particular situation. The film obviously couldn't do this, so some points are lost in translation

TLDR: It does enough to bring Orwell's vision to the big screen, but completely misses some vital points",1522454400,,921,4.941935483870968

855730,5,6304362498,"This movie is Scary. Not in the way that a film by John Carpenter or David Cronenberg would scare you.

This movie is scary because it seems real, likely to happen, as it has happened. the fear that a government that works for you or meant to be advocating for you might be the biggest threat to your life and lively hood as an authoritarian government will see you as a tool, a worker, something that can be disposed of when it has outlived its use.

1984 is a great film that covers everything wrong with Big Government, Authoritarian Government, and Fascism.
 This film IS a political piece, and its meant to be one.

This film goes over the reality of a government that has the collective right to violate your rights as an individual for the greater collective good of the people. Usually this is done to keep power from changing hands, keep the people ignorant and oppressed so that the Collectivist system can benefit those only at the top.

1984 has to be the best film on Oligarchical Collectivism and its one of the best criticisms Ive seen of collectivist systems of government (such as Proper Socialism and Communism) whose power stems from the surrender of rights and limits on the government. (ie surrendering rights and liberties for short term safety and security). Ive studied history, governments and economic theory for a while now and this film is spot on with the reality of such a government, even tho the film starts off with the story taking place within the already fascist system, the film contains many subtlety's that show how the leaders and ones in power had gotten their power and how they keep it.

This is not a film that Knocks on Democratic Socialism (as its not collectivism, its a democracy and still capitalism, not socialism). Nor does it knock on the left right spectrum, it goes after the thing we all hate the most, Fascism & Authoritarianism.

The acting is brilliant, and every actor gives their best in this film. This has to be one of the best performances by John Hurt that I have ever seen.

if a picture is worth a thousand words, than this film is worth billions of words. its timeless and a great film everyone should see along with Animal Farm (another by Orson Wells).",1522281600,4,2221,4.60506329113924

This is the ultimate Progressive Liberal (PL) totalitarian (idea of Utopia) which is in a fact the total control over mankind, because without this (Big brother) we cannot control ourselves (the swamp). Big Big Big (I am sure meant Big Brother, i.e. big government). Comrade.  We are already experiencing this today, NSA's spying program on all of us, our Free Speech has been limited, as has the illusion that we are totally free here in America, nothing could be further from the truth. While the socialized all powerful Public education system (PL) is influencing our future generations on what is acceptable behaviors and thoughts (Comrades) so you do not offend on a certain gender. I wish that someone would do an updated remake, because in 1984 this film seemed a wee bit far fetched or Sci-Fi, whereas today, not so much. It is happening. Ou children are being taught that there are 8 to 9 genders??? So brother and sister is gone to be replaced with Comrade for its neutrality. (just my guess).",1521331200,3,1104,4.810526315789474

856156,2,6304362498,"People who've read Orwell's 1984 dislike this adaptation because it leaves out the most important part--the book within the book. For a brief moment, you see the title page, the Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism by Emanuel Goldstein, but then the thought police come crashing in and it's on to the third act. They actually blocked the scene for writing in the diary with Winston (Hurt) narrating earlier in the picture, so it would have been easy to paraphrase ""the Book"" in a similar manner, with Hurt narrating Winston reading some passages from the treatise. The choice to leave this out of the film will chap the hide of anyone who's recently read the book. The film is actually quite well done save for this criticism. It's faithful to the original in its depressing tone and drab depiction, their clothes, their sickly appearance, etc. It's not a happy read and arguably, the world's not a happy place.

In this case we are lucky because both the basic story and the basic philosophy were transmitted in this movie. An added plus, you could say double plus good, was the portraying the environment as a period piece as described in the book and not as some modern version. The story 1984 was envisioned in 1948.

-------------------------------------------

In a society that has eliminated many imbalances, surplus goods, and even class struggle, there are bound to be deviates; Winston Smith (John Hurt) is one of those. He starts out, due to his inability to doublethink, with thoughtcrime. This is in a society that believes a thought is as real as the deed. Eventually he graduates through a series of misdemeanors to illicit sex (Suzanna Hamilton) and with the help of an encouraging inter party member (Richard Burton) even plans to overthrow the very government that took him in as an orphan.

If he gets caught, he will be sent to the ""Ministry of Love"" where they have a record of 100% cures for this sort of insanity. They will even forgive his past indiscretions.

856264,5,6304362498,"This is a fantastic movie, but not really a criticism of socialism at all. It's a criticism of fascism, the bourgeoisie, and liberalism. This movie is a great example of the effete bourgeoisie, flopping around like degenerated fish, until they become totally fascist and dependent on the fascist state. If this is what the producers were aiming for, they definitely did a good job. Westerners naturally and due to propaganda have difficulty grasping the hardening effects of the life or death Russian or Chinese revolutions for example, and the kind of martial law environment that this would naturally create, yet culturally, it's honestly like the opposite of this. There was no weird bourgeois sexual stuff, or behavior outside of what would be considered the norm, and these weird and discomforting sexual revolutions were a Western invention.

I like this movie a lot, and it's prophetic of the symbiotic sharpening edge of liberalism, the bourgeoisie, and fascism, and the natural progression, into an utterly irrational system, all under the cover of supreme power and authority - That is exactly what fascism was. The bourgeoisie become too weak to function and devolve into a groveling fascist mess. I admit, some historical periods of socialism were imperfect, or misguided, with Stalin as an example becoming paranoid and probably suffering from illness. Yet socialism was never scary, degenerate, and biologically terroristic like this is- an interesting modern prophecy about modern fascism, with mass scale hatred, degeneracy, sexual pathology, biological pseudo-science; this obsession with sex in an unhealthy way, either total pornography, or unhealthy and sterilized families and relationships on the other end. That's really much more like the West today too, and after Snowden, Bush, Patriot Act -  The West is coming close to this book - With our ridiculous ""Goldsteins,"" but with the fully opaque facade of a Western bourgeois fascist state and the opacity of that kind of money, and generations raised on nothing but lackluster TV shows and slick but controlled news. - National Socialism, or English Socialism, is the topic of this film, and not international socialism, or real socialist groups. We're close to spiraling into this fascist mess, with Snowden level double-think and much worse than Snowden too in reality and over the decades. Fascist Germany was just an angle of the greater capitalist decaying fascist beast.",1505606400,,2450,5.311855670103093

I recommend this movie and the other two above to everyone; they are a necessary reality check; especially for people like me who have spent so much time seeking a comfortable, materialistic life, blocking out society at large. Because I have lived such a life, I felt a bit deceived as I viewed this movie. Like I have been doing just what I was programmed to do....

This movie has some religious overtones, especially if you are following some man-made religion. Or if you are a humanist; or are socialist; or are depending on your government to make everything right, as though it is god....

Since I was lost in eastern religions for a couple of decades followed by a decade of disillusionment, those religious parallels stood out to me. But I have to say that after I was born-again at age 53, I could see how lost I had previously been. And my reading through the Bible several times and studying it and praying for obedience have enabled me to see many of the lies that previously held me captive. I believe that God's truth will liberate me as I continue to abide in it...that is hope that no man-made system can offer. Those systems offer oppression, deception....",1493856000,,1389,4.548

Winston, the main character played by John Hurt, has an unfortunate plight. He is like a leftover attempt to change this tyranny of Big Brother who is demonstrated well in the movie as 'always watching you'. So many of the new dictionary ""Newspeak"" terms growing in use in this cruel place shape everyone's thinking and the fanatical O'Brien, who is played by Richard Burton, believes in them but these terms and definitions are stifling and inhibiting instead of liberating.  Winston dares to hope for the something better which seems never to have existed. The props and atmosphere, also including the loneliness, put into this future society drama are well created and developed.  It is seriously, but entertainingly so, depressing to us the viewers given what every citizen in their tough life faces as cold, stark reality concocted from lies.

If you do ever happen to stumble upon important ""Truth"" passed down from some great mind or insider it will never be found in the form of a movie. This movie is no exception.

If you would like to know the mind of George Orwell you must read his work. Here's some of what I got from the book 1984.

Is it possible that through the techniques described by Orwell in ""1984"" that ""free"" systems of government like those in the UK and the U.S. could be subverted and overthrown gradually over time by a powerful oligarchy without the vast majority of the population even realizing what had happened? If that ""oligarchy"" that Orwell described controlled our currency, elected officials, courts, military, police, schools, virtually all electronic media and mainstream print could they control our minds as well?

I think that Orwell knew that this had already happened in the supposed ""free world"" and he was trying to warn us.

""From the proletarians nothing is to be feared. Left to themselves, they will continue from generation to generation and from century to century, working, breeding, and dying, not only without any impulse to rebel, but without the power of grasping that the world could be other than it is. They could only be dangerous if the advance of industrial technique made it necessary to educate them more highly; but, since military and commercial rivalry are no longer important, the level of popular education is actually declining. What opinions the masses hold, or do not hold, is looked upon as a matter of indifference. They can be granted intellectual liberty because they have no intellect.""
-George Orwell, 1984

""Don't you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought? In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible, because there will be no words in which to express it.""
-George Orwell, 1984

In a time of mass literacy, when citizen's are educated in state controlled schools for thirteen years or more, here is a demonstration of Newspeak that you can easily verify for yourself:

Just ask any number of average adults on the street if they can tell you how to determine if a deductive argument is both valid and sound. Ask them if they know the difference between a formal and an informal fallacy; or the difference between deductive and inductive reasoning.

I've been asking for many years and found that virtually no one in the general population knows these most basic things about formal classical logic. Why? This stuff goes back to ancient Greece circa 350 B.C.. Classical logic and rhetoric are the true tools of government, our leaders are obvious masters, and yet the general population has virtually no knowledge of these ancient sciences.

If you do not appreciate the dramtic increase in reasoning power that an effective understanding of classical logic and rhetoric can convey, then the modern policy of Newspeak has been successful in your case.

The performances are excellent.  John Hurt and Richard Burton bring Orwell's nightmare vision to life and the sets and photography are outstanding.  This is surely the best rendering of Orwell's masterpiece.  If you are feeling down and want a reason to feel up, this movie will do the trick by showing you how much more messed up a life can be.

I'm deliberately withholding too much analysis to keep from spoiling it for others.

It's the future year of 1984 (the book was written a long time ago) and England has become part of a larger totalitarian state called Oceania.  The government exercises absolute control over everything and demands complete and utter love and obedience of its citizens to a leader known only as Big Brother.  In this society the very thought of rebellion, of not absolutely loving the state is a crime in itself known as ""thoughtcrime"".  This is the story of a thought criminal and the woman he becomes involved with.

858218,4,6304362498,"I consider the novel to be utterly brilliant, though deeply disturbing.  I won't comment further on the novel, since countless others have already done so, and the Wikipedia article in particular is quite good.

As an adaptation of the novel, the movie is decent, but of course it also leaves a lot out, in this case feeling more like a 'sketch' of the novel.  The primary aim seems to be to create visual images to accompany and amplify the novel.  In that regard, I think the movie succeeds, and the acting is also top notch.

But because the movie isn't really self-contained, I do strongly recommend reading the novel first.  The movie will then serve as a chilling reminder of what can happen if too few people acquire too much power (for its own sake), beyond what the masses can counteract.  And lest we think that the masses can't be manipulated to that extent, let's not forget what happened with the Germans during Nazism.",1416700800,2,932,4.646341463414634

John Hurt was magnificent in the movie.  He played Winston so well, I was sure I was reading the book again instead of watching the movie.  His falling in love with Julia (a young Suzanna Hamilton) was both tragic and wonderful.  Hamilton played both her part and Winston well.

In this world, not only saying things as they are is unimaginable but even thinking them through is a crime as the citizenry needs to be dumbed down into a servile and mindless horde. Knowledge is power and it must be destroyed so that the perceived reality can be more easily shaped by oppressors who will settle for nothing less than blind devotion from people to perpetuate their own rule.

858562,5,6304362498,"George Orwell's dystopian classic NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR drew film offers like sugar draws flies--but Orwell's widow, Sonia Brownell, was not enthusiastic.  She agreed only on the condition that no ""futuristic effects"" be used in the film, and signed the contracts a few days before her death in 1980.  After a difficult casting process, the project began filming in England in 1984, in the very months specified by Orwell in the book itself.  It was rushed to release in October of that year in order to take advantage of being released in its title year.

The film is necessarily simplified from the novel, but even so it captures Orwell's totalitarian society extremely well.  In the aftermath of a great war, England has become a part of a superstate known as Oceania.  The nation is constantly at war with other superstates and constantly under attack by rebels.  The state is sophistocated enough to be able to monitor all of its citizens, and is particularly concerned with ""thoughtcrime,"" which occurs when one questions or thinks differently than others.  It actively seeks to manipulate its citizens through fear of war and terrorism, through reduction of the language, and through destruction of the family unit.  Winston Smith (John Hurt) is a minor beauocrat on the fringe of the ruling party, and he has come to hate the party--and he knows that this will inevitably discovered and he will likely be killed.  He meets and falls in love with Julia (Suzanna Hamilton), and the two begin an affair, know that their relationship is both ""thoughtcrime"" and ""sexcrime,"" knowing they must ultimately be detected.  And they are.

The novel is very dark and the film no less so, particularly in the portion of the film that follows Winston and Julia's arrest.  It offers no easy answers and no easy way out for its characters; even so, the conclusion is not entirely what one might expect.  The film is beautifully performed, with notable supporting performances from Richard Burton and Cyril Cusack.  The color palatte, created by a special process, is remarkable, and the sets, costumes, and details are memorable throughout.  There has been some controversy about the soundtrack.  I am a fan of the Eurythmics soundtrack for the film, I own a copy of it, and it is true that the film has been largely shorn of it--but quite frankly, NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR is not a movie that calls out for an elaborate soundtrack, and I was fine with the occasional echos of music the film uses.

If I have a complaint about the film, it is that it seems every so slightly slow at points.  More particularly, I found the way in which the film overlaps the endless announcements with the characters' dialogue made the film hard to follow in spots.  Nonetheless, this is a powerful movie, disturbing, memorable, and like the novel a warning against the twists and turns society can take.  We have seen a number of such societies--from Nazi Germany to North Korea--visited upon the earth, and NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR reminds us of the need for eternal vigilance.  Recommended.

858735,2,6304362498,"1984 stands as one of the best novels of its time, maybe of all time. The story in its literary conception is brilliant, with its symmetries, use of songs to link characters across class and time, and uncanny satirical allegory. This film followed the story quite closely, unlike many novel adaptations. What is thought provoking and memorable on the page, however, is not quite so engaging on the screen. The fascinating part of Nineteen Eighty-four is Winston's internal dialog, which when turned into narration or spoken dialog is too compressed in time to have the same effect. In film, acting should show, not tell, what characters are feeling. Unfortunately, it is part of Orwell's tale that no one is allowed to show emotions, and in the film, they don't. Orwell's imagined world, while faithfully rendered, is just more sinister in the mind's eye. On screen, Orwell's oppressive grey drudgery is drab and monotonous, two qualities that do not an interesting film make. Even Winston's greatest fear, rats, is scarier to him in his mind than it is to us viewers watching. I have tried to watch this film through on five separate occasions and fallen asleep every time. I've been kept up late reading and re-reading the novel. Here we see the reason most (good) adaptations stray rather far from the source material.  A different medium makes for different tools for communicating, especially in such a psychological tale as 1984. This film failed to use its medium's strengths. Where it did stray, such as calling Big Brother ""BB"" inventing the silly overhead ""V"" sign, and giving Big Brother a little, almost Hitlerian moustache instead of a huge dominating Stalin version, the film actually subtracted from the story's power. Skip this one. Try Gattaca instead, which gets at least 3.5 stars. Better yet, City Of Lost Children or Delicatessen.",1400371200,2,1851,5.009740259740259

The beautiful bleach bypass processing (seen in the streaming Amazon Prime version) is not used on this transfer. Instead, this DVD, taken from a film inter-positive, is garish and looks like video with cardboard sets. See the example I posted under photos. On his website, Roger Deakins, cinematographer of the film stated--

""We used a bleach bypass process for all the prints of '1984'. It was the first time that this particular process was used on a feature film, as far as I know, and was created by Kay's lab in the UK. The process adds contrast as well as desaturates the image due to the retention of the developed silver in the emulsion. It gives the projected image a kind of luminous quality. Sadly, some of the latest DVDs do not reflect our original intentions as the distributer has not matched to a print but just taken a transfer from an IP, which, of course, is in full colour. That's more than annoying as some of the costumes and sets were actually over saturated in order to compensate for the kind of processing we were using.""",1398643200,23,1118,4.618090452261306

858819,5,6304362498,"It is tragically disconcerting how rapidly reality has caught up with prophesy in the case of this novel that I would place among the 10 greatest in all languages in all time to the present. Everyone with no more than a modest interest in history, literature, and politics will be aware of its themes of oppression, deception, distortion, and destruction, wreaked upon an entire nation by a governing cabal that writes not only the present and the future, but the past as well. The country is at war, but not actually at war. Its economy is expanding exponentially, but actually contracting. Its citizens are free, but actually fettered by the forces of those that run the country in their name. All its citizens are equal to each other, but not to those who rule and control them. The myriad concepts and ideas that were born between its pages ----- Big Brother, Doublespeak, Thought Police, continuous electronic monitoring of speech and behavior, and so many others ----- are all alive and well in our modern world, and not just in our totalitarian states. There is as much in our so-called democracies. Even ""waterboarding"", described as an interrogational tool and illustrated in one of the many horrific scenes in the film, is used to defend certain modern democratic states.
The first thing to say is that this novel is as unpromising for translation to the Silver Screen as Joyce's ""Ulysses"". Yet just as Joseph Strick astonished us with the latter work, Michael Radford does an equally good job here. In both efforts, the caliber of the actors was the key to success: Milo O'Shea, Maurice Roeves, Barbara Jefford and TP McKenna in ""Ulysses""; John Hurt, Richard Burton, Cyril Cusack and Suzanna Hamilton in ""1984"". Both directors managed to assemble superb production teams that provided a final set of photographic images in which you could not only see, but also smell, taste and feel every building, street  and quarter of the city in which the action is centred. There are already 414 reviews of this great artistic accomplishment. Why on earth is Amazon continuing to solicit yet more? The recent examples I have read are pathetic. Rather than adding to their number, I would admonish you to go right back to the beginning -----2003, and spend your time reading the first three reviews ------ by The Sentinel, Jeffrey Leach, and Claude Avary. The 411 scribes who followed them added nothing of note, and their scribbles are just a blockade preventing immediate access to the three most useful critiques of the movie. I just want to address one important plea to those who manufacture and those who sell DVDs: why on earth is it so difficult to obtain an affordable copy of one of the most important movies ever made?",1397347200,,2729,4.856223175965665

He is one of those actors who can class up anything you put in front of him. Richard Burton is terrifying as O'Brien. Orwell meant his tale to be a warning against centralized government.

Control simply for the sake of control, where neither side actually gains form it, seems to pointless to be beleivable.

He is utterly convincing in this role as the advocate of ""political conformity"", but at the same time conveying an element of political cynicism inherent in his role. Torture and cruelty are simply tools used as a means to an end. No contradiction in terms for O'Brien and any method employed to extract loyalty and conformity in thought from his victims seems to be justified.

I spent the entire movie, and several hours thereafter, explaining everything. *Everything*.  Everyone was bored to tears, me included, and everyone but me was confused as they possibly could be.

However, I was more than bored: I was irate!  This movie does not do the book justice.  Indeed, I haven't found many movies that are worse adaptations than 1984.  The let-down was so great that I still remember it 30 years later.  You might compare the movie to the book as a malfunctioning sparkler to a fireworks grand finale.

859711,3,6304362498,"I would say this is my favorite version of George Orwell's amazing novel 1984. 4 reasons: 1) John Hurt 2) great soundtrack from Eurythmics, 3) it was Richard Burton's final feature film and 4) it was filmed in the exact time and setting as George Orwell imagined it in his novel (1984 England). 1984 is about a government worker in the future who yearns for freedom. He meets a woman along the way but is under constant surveillance in this frightening police-state setting with class systems, war, starvation and other maladies pushing humans to the edge. The film is very faithful to the novel, effective at creating mood, very interesting and relevant to today's society. If you like the book I think you will be stunned by the overwhelmingly moody, dark and depressing visuals complemented by great performances from everyone. In other words, they captured the theme perfectly in the film. This is not a feel good movie. It's a powerful, captivating and shocking film. Some may consider it an intellectual version of Saw.

My only complaints are the VHS release had more music from the Eurythmics that seems to be removed on the digital releases but otherwise it is complete. Also, no extras or special features are provided. That's a damn shame for such an iconic book and film! There is also an older 1956 version of 1984 that is equally devoid of extras. I would be willing to rate it 5 stars otherwise because a bare bones release of this classic doesn't do it justice. Alas there has never been a deluxe release of this film. A Blu-ray loaded with hours of special features, a making of documentary and music options would be terrific.

  Those not familiar with Orwell's book or interested in politics might find the film depressing.",1376438400,,426,5.461538461538462

859778,3,6304362498,"First of all, I must say that the LOOK and ATMOSPHERE of this movie is very UN-""80s""...the movie looks like it was made in the ""40's""....yes, I understand the BOOK was written in the ""40s"", but maybe someone should make an UPDATED version of the movie...might be a thought.

Second of all, the movie is weird, dismal, dreary....no attractive people to look at, fair warning...and a bit CONFUSING to watch!  That was the FIRST time I watched it.  By the second viewing, I had started putting things together and the movie made more sense. So be patient...if you are a bit confused by things after your initial viewing, give the movie another chance.  Things will click.  As for the dark dreary atmosphere?  Well, I guess that's the look they were going for!

The message of the movie is disturbing.  You realize just how awful it would be to live in a country where your every move is determined by ""Big Brother"" (i.e., the government).  You also realize that the government has the ability to lie to you and brainwash you.  You can't even have your own thoughts, or you will be accused of ""thought crime!""  No individuality; no difference of opinion...no personal life, even (because that takes time away from your support of ""the government"" and love of ""big brother"")...and horror of horrors, you can' even enjoy sex!

Yes, speaking of which, there is plenty of odd nudity in this movie....you have been warned!  Full frontal (and ""backal"") nudity of a young girl....(yes, something else that is disturbing...the main guy in the movie, although supposedly in his thirties, appears to be in his late forties or fifties, whereas his love interest appears to be 17 -18...again...you have been warned)!

The love story is a priority in the plot....

All in all, I feel this is a movie worth seeing due to the important message of what can happen if big government is allowed to take over every aspect of our lives...a world is created that you would never EVER want to be a part of......however, this is no upbeat la-di-da type flick...and do NOT view with young children!",1376006400,,2070,4.743016759776537

859894,1,6304362498,"If you are familiar with this particular movie, and you are one of those people who are sensitive to speed and pitch, then you should definitely not buy this Korean edition. I have watched this movie dozens of times before, and I also have the original Dominic Muldowney soundtrack on CD. I noticed immediately that something was wrong. The movie runs slightly faster than it is supposed to run. It is especially noticeable when the Muldowney parts of the soundtrack music are playing, and it is even noticeable during the dialogue. Everything is too fast, and therefore at a higher pitch than it should be. I know a lot of people could get past this, and some people may not even notice it, but it is so distracting to me that I want to return it. However, Amazon's return policy states that they will only refund 50% of a DVD purchase if it has been opened. I guess asking how you are supposed to know whether or not there is something wrong with a DVD without opening the box is a stupid question. As I said before, I'm sure some people will not even notice the speed error, but others will, so I think it's best to avoid buying this Korean version. In this high-tech world of digital precision, it is difficult to understand why this transfer could not be done at the exact speed as the original release.

The entire film has a dreary, unhappy, but very interesting plot as it describes a time when an iron-fisted Socialist government, led by ""Big Brother,"" has absolute, 24/7 control of every activity of its citizens.  The gloomy atmosphere is enhanced by the use of mainly dull black, gray,  brown, and blue colors throughout.  There is rarely a day when the sun shines.

Nothing is added to Orwell's book and very little is deleted or re-sequenced except what is necessary to make this very cerebral story coherent on film. Much of the script is drawn directly from the text of the novel. Visually, the movie is notable for its drab colors and shabby, dilapidated sets which is exactly what one should expect if they've read the novel. Even the set decoration in Winston's row of cubicles in the Ministry Of Truth is exactly what one would expect. The acting is exceptional with a pall of ""Orwellian"" fatalism hanging over all of the characters except for the mindlessly menacing Outer Party drones amongst whom Winston works in Minitrue. Richard Burton is perfect in what would turn out to be his final role as O'brien, the treacherous Inner Party agent of the Thought Police and Winston's calmly sadistic inquisitor. The only aspect of the film that may be difficult for the non-reader of the novel will be the surreal depictions of Winston's premonitions of his own fate and disjointed flashbacks of his own childhood.

Because the 'telescreens'  are now anywhere, and probably in form of pc and t.v...Orwell said WW II has influenced  him towrite this novel, and maybe you could see why...With  also the
character description of Mao, nowadays Chave and back in the 40's-Hitler. George Orwell had them inspiring him to write this novel (also because of dominant parties those leaders must uphold ""for the benefit of many"")which makes it very  well spoken of in intellectual circles and political parties(especially anarchists). Orwell made no love  with this world but he presented our leader-the media.  as sustainable and how it feeds our minds.
It''s complex film for those who haven't read the book, but it's never too late to read the novel :)

George Orwell's life affected his way of writing 1984 and other books. He stands in the same line with Albert Camus and Aldous Huxley, for me, because the 3 have written about social reform and one novel that fits '1984' is Animal Farm too... But Orwell had a way of capturing his audience by giving real life facts and reference to a future we are now part of!

As you read a novel, you come to picture in your mind the characters the author has created.  The characters played on the screen by John Hurt, Richard Burton and Suzanna Hamilton are the 100% embodiment of what Orwell intended.  The novel is not compromised in plot, dialogue, or character portrayal whatsoever.

The finite movie run time of 113 min. did not allow the movie to deliver all the miserable detail of a limitless novel.  E.g., the novel devoted much time into detailing ""Newspeak"", which was the devolution of the English language into a dumbed down simplified version of itself in step with the dumbing down of it's citizenry into a mindless mob.  But in defense of the movie, that detail does not readily lend itself to the screen because it requires no characters or dialogue.

It remains a mystery to me why Orwell (real name Eric Blair), who was a devout socialist, would portray the outcome of socialism in the honest manner that he did.  Nevertheless, my bottom line critical analysis is that the movie = the novel.  If that's what you're looking for in a novel based movie, you will give ""1984"" a `5 stars' also",1342310400,2,1323,4.717391304347826

860435,3,6304362498,"Of course it's depressing. It's supposed to be depressing. Still, it is a well-crafted production of a very dark story.

John Hurt plays Winston Smith, an outer party hack whose job it is to ""correct"" history. When something happens today that is contradictory to what happened in the past, the records from the past must all be edited. That's Winston's job, along with a room full of other outer party hacks.

We learn a little bit about the way IngSoc (English Socialism) works, but not much. A lot of the talk is in Newspeak, and you can follow it a great deal better in the book than you can in a movie. Still, it is clear that Big Brother is the figurehead leader, and reality is manipulated any way the party wants to.

Suzanna Hamilton plays Julia, a 25-year-old outer party functionary who is active in the anti-sex league but loves sex privately. Needless to say, she has to seduce the rabbit-scared Smith. We get a few nude scenes, where she is lean but attractive, and he is a stringy scarecrow. They rent a room above a curio shop where they can be alone. Even if you've never read the book or seen the earlier movie, you can guess how that works out.

The real casting triumph is Richard Burton as O'Brien, the inner party functionary who suckers Smith and Julia into betraying themselves. He's the one who delivers the famous line: ""If you would like to know the future, Winston, think of a boot crushing the face of a man forever.""

""Who controls the present controls the future."" The people of Oceania are warned against the people of Eurasia, and an arch-traitor. The crowd reacts with emotion (like some TV show audiences). The banner if ""Ingsoc"" flies for adoration. We see people working in cubicles. Big Brother is watching you! One man works at rewriting history (what newspapers and magazines usually do). [The coughing of Winston Smith must symbolize the tuberculosis of George Orwell, a disease that can arise from a poor diet due to war-time rationing.] Society is very regimented. Production statistics are faked; there are shortages. [Another reference to wartime rationing.] People are entertained by public hangings [like some current reality shows], and news about increased rations (really a decrease). The confessions of the condemned may reference Stalin's purge trials (a successor of Byzantine intrigues). Winston Smith finds a used goods store.

""War is Peace. Ignorance is Strength."" Crowds cheer the executions of prisoners. [Most people find happiness in other people's suffering.] The ""V"" sign is a national symbol. A couple meet in the woods where it is safer. Does the existence of families threaten Ingsoc? [Or corporate power?] Real food is highly valued (as in wartime Europe). Smith is offered a newer dictionary with up-to-date definitions. Are old nursery rhymes outlawed as ""politically incorrect""? Smith changes the history books. ""Eurasia has always been our ally."" A flashback tells of Winston's past. [Note the rats.] O'Brien lectures Smith about ""thought criminals"". They spread knowledge from generation to generation. Winston finds a secret in that new book. Essays on the workings of society sound radical, or real. There is a shocking surprise! Another man in jail is a ""thought criminal"" even if he didn't know it. Will he be sent to a labor camp?

Smith is tortured for the sake of torture. The questions are like religious dogma, where the wrong answer brings damnation. ""How many fingers?"" ""Reality is in the human mind."" Collective memory is immortal. ""I don't know."" Breaking the will? O'Brien explains their method of annihilation. ""You do not exist."" Power exists by inflicting pain.

""1984"" was a satire of England and the world of 1948. The wartime Allies became enemies in the Cold War. The British, Dutch, and French lost their colonies.

I think ""The Darkness at Noon"" was a better story (based on actual events). Could ""television"" be used to control the thinking of people? [Yes, its working now.]

860488,5,6304362498,"The film is gray and drab, setting an atmosphere of hopelessness and despair...for those awake to the true reality. Others among the Sheeple wouldn't know any different. The film does a good job of sticking to Orwell's novel, but I came away wanting more. More of the inner workings of the Party and more of Winston's daily life of meager existence. If you've read the book, you'll be able to fill in the pieces. You are required to use your imagination a bit and this is where having read the book will help immensely. I once read that one page in a script translates into one minute on screen. To do Orwell's nightmare justice another thirty minutes would have been welcomed. All in all, this is a great movie. Ever try to find it for sale? Wonder why it's so hard to get...

What's scary is the parallels to today's times. In the book Orwell states that the war is never meant to be won, but all that matters is that it be indefinite. War on Terror anyone? Goldstein was the Party's favorite whipping boy. Osama Bin Laden perhaps? Quite a useful tool these past ten years, but even the political string pullers knew his usefulness had come to an end - He either died in Tora Bora or shortly thereafter of renal failure. The ever present telescreens with Big Brothers face? Cameras everywhere we turn these days recording our every move, and not to mention the proles all to eager to give every bit of their personal information away on Facebook. And yet they randomly complain about privacy settings. Ever watch Wag The Dog? How easy is it to pull off a hoax and get the brain dead public to believe a lie?

What didn't exist before 9/11? The DHS and the Patriot Act. But you didn't really need those Constitutional rights and freedoms anyway. Did you? The ever present and never ending War on Terror was born. Ever since there's been a high profile botched terror attempt here and there...that we somehow magically stop in the nick of time! Let's all cheer and agree we need to lose more of our freedoms in support of this war. The book parallel? That female voice once again telling us about some small victory won in the latest battle. Here's an excerpt from the book that fits. Think of this every time there is a staged attack or attempt:

""Once when he happened in some connection to mention the war against Eurasia, She startled him by saying casually that in her opinion the rocket bombs which fell daily on London were probably fired by the Government of Oceania itself, `just to keep people frightened.'"" Anything to keep the public school graduates believing the lie.

Recently the crowds gathered outside the White House to cheer Osama's killing. Reminded me of the Two Minutes Hate for Goldstein and his associates. And what about Big Sis Napolitano's plan to use Facebook and text messages to keep us informed about how scared we should be as well as how glad we are that our freedoms are rapidly vanishing? Just like the omnipresent female voice blaring out of the telescreen. Just visit a Wal Mart and you'll see the telescreen.

No need to think for yourself in these times. The public school system has taken care of that. Just vote for one of the two major parties. They're both bought and paid for and voting for one is really a vote for the other. At the end of the day, they're the same. It's all a card game with a stacked deck not in our favor.

False Flag attacks have been a tool used for a long time. Hitler burning the Reichstag; Johnson sinking the USS Liberty, Operation AJAX, Gulf of Tonkin, and Operation Gladio to name a few.

Read the book, watch the movie and think about these times we're living in. Ask yourself who profits and what is the reaction by the government after these staged attempts.

Wake up people. The TSA will soon be at the mall and train and bus stations. It won't be long before we have to go through a scanner at every major sporting event. I guess the reasoning is violating non-Middle Eastern descent American citizens' Constitutional rights prevents Islamic terror?

Orwell's vision is a warning where we are headed...it's just too bad that message is lost on those more interested in American Idol and Dancing with the Stars.",1304380800,6,4189,4.574666666666666

It is in English audio and you can just turn the subtitles ""off"".  (For whatever the reason, you still can't get it at Netflix.)  Also problematic is that the DVD price has been climbing needlessly high, and I feel lucky to have, recently, found a reasonably priced copy from Amazon Marketplace.  While some viewers might feel that the society Orwell presents, ""can't happen or is unrealistic"", the fact is, that it already has happened and continues to take place from religious fanatics who would burn our books and films that they find sinful, to and the daily, ""propaganda"" of Rupert Murdoch's news empire and the global corporations that dominate our world.",1298073600,6,1377,4.973799126637554

860496,5,6304362498,"Orwell's classic depiction of a totalitarian government oppressing society to the brink of stupidity, and the disheartening tale of Winston Smith's defeat in his fight against the system, is depicted in this enlightening film, with John Hurt portraying a demure, sullen Smith.

The film's plot follows suit to the novel's quite religiously, with only minor changes made to suit the traversal from the mind's eye to the big screen; Big Brother is as you would expect: menacing, imposing, consuming. Smith also fits one's mental picture: tired, repressed, possessing only a few glimmers of hope enveloped in a thick blue fabric of depression.

The scenario, costuming, and effects are fitting to the book. While not overpowering the viewer, they communicate the atmosphere that the Party has created, from the dark alleys in the prole section to the foreboding building, the Ministry of Truth, that Winston is tortured in.

The film only falls short of its mark in the field of intensity. At times, Orwell stresses his characters in situations almost unimaginable to the mind's eye; in the film, these same situations are portrayed rather apathetically. Artistic rights aside, the depiction could have included more of Orwell's original thematic interplay with Winston's torturous ordeals after being captured. Nevertheless, the film is an excellent depiction of the novel, and is an artistic work of its own merit. END",1287360000,3,1417,5.288888888888889
860497,5,6304362498,"As the owner of the four adaptations of the Orwellian classic ""1984"" brought to the screen, this version is the second to the perfect adaptation of the 'Utopia Gone Sour' novel written by George Orwell.

The first version, ""1984"" was produced in 1954 by the BBC for English television.  It is a fair version, bringing the novel to the light of the small screen.  It added a lot of details of conversation that the book had, although in the end, it was rather cheesy.

The second version, ""1984"" was produced in 1956 in England.  This was the version a lot of us in High School saw at political assemblies, and it introduced us to Orwellian concepts.  In the earlier version, Big Brother was made to look like a heavyset mean bully.  In this version, Big Brother was made to look like  Jack Webb's ""Joe Friday"" in the Dragnet television series- a truly disturbing and frightening countenance.  This version also tried to remain true to the Orwellian vision, although it was infused with 50's moral values superimposed in a Big Brother society.  In both the versions mentioned so far, Donald Pleasance of ""Halloween"" fame delivers  outstanding performances.  These versions are worthy of finding and purchasing for the viewing of Pleasance's performances.

The third version ""1984"" was produced in 1984 by Radford.  This version is the quintessential version that is more Orwellian than Orwell!  This version is far more subtle and menacing than the previous versions.  Even the picture of this Big Brother is so subtle and frightening!  By the time of the movie's ending, we know what kind of smile is hidden under Big Brother's mustache!  John Hurt is the perfect Winston Smith, even to his similar appearance to George Orwell!  Richard Burton's role as O'brien is the crown jewel of his entire acting career.  Ever so soft spoken, ever so patronizing, ever so menacing and ever so cruel.  This movie was filmed in desaturated colors, faithfully replicating the mood of Orwell's novel.  And the soundtrack performed by the Eurythmics was the perfect marriage.  Those fortunate enough to have purchased this version on VHS tape should hold on to that tape, because it is a valuable contribution to the art of movie making.

The fourth version ""1984"" was made in the early 2000's by MGM.  It is the Radford version made in 1984, sans the desaturated colors and sans the Eurythmics.  It is disappointing for several reasons.  The original Radford vision is ruined by the saturated colors, that alone destroys the mood of the film.  Also missed is the Eurythmics soundtrack.  Also there are few bonuses on this DVD version for the USA.  What a disappointment.  Yet it is still worth having, because the Orwellian vision remains intact.

If you want choices in the DVD, purchase the English PAL version at the English Amazon site.  Then purchase an all format DVD player so you can view PAL formatted DVD's.  Until MGM decides to upgrade their USA version, this is the only true option you have.",1282953600,8,2990,4.867063492063492

860549,4,6304362498,"After having seen this version more than 4 times, I find that it is the truest attempt to portray the intended Orwellian atmosphere. No film can adequately translate all of the innuendoes of a book, but this--like the 1951 version of ""Christmas Carol""--very nearly succeeds.

John Hurt is a perfect Winston: A man both living and dead. He is a frail, near-empty shell of a man, filled only with repressed anger and unsated emotional needs in a mechanistic world.

Richard Burton's O'Brien is a refreshing coupe de gras for his final film. Understated, superficially caring and almost a subtle kindness in his tone, he too is devoid of humanity.

Hurt's need for recognition as an individual is found in meeting Julia (Suzanna Hamilton). Initially, an attraction first based on hate--a distortion of love, they are lonely creatures embedded in the monolithic society who affirm each's need for individuality so widely crushed by Big Brother and the Inner Party.

Most paradoxical and appealing is Burton's relationship to Hurt when the latter is caught and tortured. With a soothing, almost caring for Winston, O'Brian guides Winston through brainwashing in pain and fear. Most fascinating is Winston's admonition of love for O'Brien, an eruption of his need for love despite the traumas inflicted on him and one that essentially kills off the love of Julia.

The dismal finale, shows Winston and Julia in an unemotional, unattached interaction. She is replaced in the same scene by his love of the State and Big Brother, the missing father figure first filled by O'Brien, then Big Brother himself.

860557,5,6304362498,"1984 (Nineteen Eighty Four): 8 out of 10: Most films simply don't age all that well. Philadelphia with Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington for example simply doesn't have the same impact today that it did in 1993. (Both gay people in general and AIDS in particular are simply less scary today.) In another example we have seen both technology and fashion move so fast that the futuristic phones in many a seventies sci-fi movie look positively ancient today not to mention the burnt orange and avocado green color scheme of the future that so many seventies sci-fi are stuck with. (I'm looking your way Rollerball.)

So how has a film, released when people outside of American colleges actually believed communism worked, aged today?

Brilliantly. If I say so myself. If anything the film works better today than it did in 1985.

For starters the film itself is timeless. Nothing about the film gives away the date that it was made. Only the fact I know who John Hurt and Richard Burton are gives a hint to time period. The film itself could have been released in theaters last week.

Since the film comments heavily on torture in its last act and on 'Big Brotherism' throughout, if released today it undoubtly would be seen as a direct attack on both the Bush administration and the British Labor government. In fact many scenes are a clear attack on the Bush administrations torture policy and the endless war on 'Terrorism'. One could almost never believe the film was about Communism at all. Modern audiences today would laugh at such a quaint notion.

With few exceptions I have never known a film so timeless. Heck it is one better than simple timelessness. It is actually more relevant today than when it was made. The idea of government using an endless indefinable and unwinnable war to curtail its subject's freedoms is right from today's headlines; whether you are discussing the war on drugs, terrorism, or global warming the results are the same. All the good intentions in the world simply mean less freedom for you and your children. 'For the greater good' no less.

Orwell would be shocked at the creativity governments today would use to curtail peoples freedoms and lives. Or perhaps he wouldn't and that is why his story is so timeless and most remarkably the film based on it is as well.

Oh and the film is fun with a brilliant and perfectly cast John Hurt in the primary role as the put upon and tortured everyman. Richard Burton, not chewing scenery for once, in a role with gravitas; his last I believe. Also super cute and believable Suzanna Hamilton who looks like a real woman both in and out of her clothes as the love interest and the catalyst for desire of change. And a special kudos to a fantastic direction by Michael Radford and production design by Allan Cameron. The really capture a place and time that as I have said before is timeless.

860614,1,6304362498,"In many respects, this adaptation of George Orwell's ""1984"" should stand out as an example of how you don't adapt a novel for the big screen. No film version can ever match the depth and detail of the original novel upon which it is based, but when a film is done this badly it demands an answer the obvious question, ""What was the director thinking?""

To be fair, I like director Michael Radford's treatment of the external world of London as bleak and almost lifeless, although I think that the neighborhoods of the proletariat should have been much darker and more foreboding. Their environment seemed poor, but didn't evoke the same emotions as Orwell's well-written descriptions of dark alleys and the myriad of pubs that are filled with the down-trodden masses of non-party members. And with that same thought in mind we begin to see the first of many departures from the novel - aside from the antique shop and Winston's prostitute encounter there are no portrayals of any of the other scenes that make up more of the surrounding story in the proletariat world.

I realize that a director only has so much time to work with when creating a movie, but this director left out large chunks of the story in order to make it fit the time frame, and I feel sorry for anyone that hasn't read the book because so much of the movie won't mean anything. This movie could almost represent a condensed version of the original, except that it shows scenes out of order, it doesn't explain why so much of the story is actually occurring, and it changes a great deal of the detail in ways that are unforgivable. Here are just a few examples: In the novel Winston worked for Minitrue (Ministry of Truth), although in the film it mentions Winston working for Minirec (Ministry of Records). In the novel Winston does not exclaim that he hates Julia before discovering that she secretly loves him. In the film, Winston's vision of Julia undressing in a field occurs just before their first romantic encounter, not some weeks earlier in a dream as in the novel. I could go on and on, but there are a great number of these scenes that are not simply errors or a failure of attention to detail, they are the director's deliberate attempts to place his stamp on someone else's work. I believe in artistic expression, but if you want to make your own mark - create your own story; don't create a hatchet-job of someone else's work.

One of my largest complaints is the deliberate omission of a great detail of information surrounding the Socialism and Communism themes that are so prevalent in the novel; Ingsoc is never explained as a newspeak amalgamation of English Socialism, everyone is called brother or sister instead of comrade, and the recurring treatment of society's failed attempts to obtain even the most basic of necessities of life due to the government's ineptitude at production are missing. What's more infuriating is the portrayal of Winston's day-to-day activities at Minitrue/Minirec - you're vaguely aware that he is doing SOMETHING, but the film version manages to omit what that actually is. Having read the book we know that he was altering the past, but the film doesn't convey that. In fact, the film conveys very little - if you have read the book then the film simply gives you fleeting images to go along with the story line that you already know, but in most respects the film's failure to align with the novel begins to interfere with what you remember about the story.

Much like ""Animal Farm"", which is George Orwell's other treatment of communism, ""1984"" is supposed to be a sharp arrow piercing through the utopian vision of a communism by portraying a world where a corrupt government cannot live up to its promises, but this adaptation completely misses the target. At the time this movie was created the Cold War was still raging, and I can only surmise that the director toned down the communist-themed overtones in order to appease the Soviet Union; if that's the case - that's a really weak argument.

I truly feel sorry for someone that sees this film and has never read the book. After watching this movie I got the feeling that the director, Michael Radford, was trying to create a visual masterpiece like Stanley Kubrick did with ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", but unfortunately Michael Radford is NOT Stanley Kubrick, and as a result he created a film that is little more than an insult to the original novel, and my only take-away from this film is the feeling that I have lost two hours of my life.",1243468800,9,4524,4.699873896595208

860616,5,6304362498,"1984 is simply one of the best filmed adaptions of any novel.  This particular version filmed in 1984 works so well on so many levels that one is led from one scene to another in a manner that leaves one breathless even for those familiar with the book by George Orwell.  Let me begin with a rarely mentioned level of criticism--the quality of the film itself.  Though shot in color, director Michael Radford was careful to mute the colors such that what the audience sees seems more black and white, thus intensifying the crushingly grim reality of life in Oceania. London itself is presented as a city in disrepair, with cracked paint and corrosive rust ubiquitous.  And in the midst of this urban miasma is the protagonist Winston Smith (John Hurt), one who is Everyman for the 1980s.  There is absolutely nothing special about him. Even his last name reinforces his anonymity, though his first name implies a reaching out for that which is just beyond reach.  Smith works as a history re-writer, a job that well enables him to see up close one of the Party's most sacred rules: ""Those who control the Present control the Past.  Those who control the Past control the Future."" He knows by rote these and similar rules, but to him they are verbal effluvium, phrases that do not touch his essence.  Everyone else in Oceania is similarly verbally constructed.

Into his life enters Julia (Suzanna Hamilton), a sex-obsessed female who instinctively recognizes the nihilistic emptiness of English Socialism (Ingsoc). She seduces him, knowing all the while that in their common agreement that ""They are the Dead,"" and must suffer the inevitable fate of exposure by the Thought Police. O'Brien, supremely played by Richard Burton in his last role, seduces Winston psychologically, though in the book he confronts both.  In the film, he uses his softly modulated voice to seem the very pinnacle of reason, never more reasonable than in the torture scenes when he positions himself as Winston's pseudo-father figure who wants only to return Winston to a politically correct right reason.

1984 in both book and film considers a host of issues that resonate as well today as back in the 1940s when first it hit print: what is an individual, how can we trust, what is common sense, and ultimately what is it that Winston refers to in Room 101 as that evanescent Spirit of Man that will triumph over brute dictatorship? When Orwell has O'Brien intone that man is infinitely malleable, he wanted O'Brien to suggest that man's spirit can be shaped and reshaped in any manner the interrogator wishes. But on some deep and buried level in Winston, Orwell also implies that this malleability need not be permanent.  If Winston and Julia could sin before their conversion, then it is only a matter of time before they relearn that their inner natures are truly malleable and that they can ""snap back"" with a sheer act of will.  The closing scene where Julia suggests that they must meet again is an ironic commentary on their ultimate ability to do just that no matter what viciousness O'Brien heaped on both of them.  1984 is a stark yet unforgettable punctuation that the Spirit of Man will live on after all.",1237680000,3,3196,4.8083941605839415

860668,5,6304362498,"Michael Radford's adaptation of the well-known novel by Orwell is very faithful to its source material and very impressive. The cast is perfect in its leading trio: John Hurt as Winston Smith, Suzanna Hamilton as Julia and last but certainly not least in his last movie performance Richard Burton as O'Brien.

Orwell's dystopian vision of the future will be well known to most of us.
Winston Smith, the central character, lives in a totalitarian world, in which all pay homage to the ominous ever present ""Big Brother"" and, To sort of keep birth rates at an acceptable level, war is continually waged against some kind of enemy, that seems to change as much as wind direction whatever the fear mongers deem appropriate.

Inhabitants of this world are continually bombarded with propaganda through a kind of two-way TV screens that are present in both the private as well as the public domain. The screens also serve as a way of keeping continuous watch on people as it is forbidden to switch them off

Through the destruction of any sense of history and knowledge that might be identity reinforcing, the masses are being ""educated"" into being mindless canon fodder.

Love, never mind sex, is forbidden, as it sabotages the goal mentioned above and aside from that all that penned up sexual frustration can be used as a reservoir to tap into and turn into boundless aggression and almost erotic admiration for ""Big Brother"".

In this mob Winston is consumed and invisible, until he meets Julia and they start an affair, half out of love, half as an act of rebellion against the state. However, from the outside they know their eventual fate and admit to each other ""We are the Dead"".

The third figure O'Brien comes into the picture when Smith and Julia want to contact a supposed underground resistance movement and they contact him as being a key figure in it. The truth is both shocking and revealing.

Contrary to what some people think, the book was not meant as a criticism of communism per se, but against any form of dictatorship, there are plenty of comments made by Orwell on this subject.

The movie does a wonderful job in bringing not so much uplifting as shockingly hypnotic and intriguing story to life. Orwell envisioned as a location a post-WWII London and Radford very much stayed true to this idea. His city quite obviously is in decay and full of ruins shown in murky colors like WW II archive documentary images. The cinematography is wonderful.

John Hurt is perfect as the worn out Winston Smith being in a state of hopeless and irreversible decay.
Burton as O'Brien is equally unforgettable and merciless; his eyes that offer nothing but the hopelessness of self-awareness, the realization of the insignificance of the individual being grinded down under the boot of the state.

The movie is as merciless as the book, thank God. I consider it the most faithful book adaptation. It was exactly as I imagined it while reading the book.

A masterpiece, still underrated.",1219968000,2,2990,4.8317025440313115

I wish this was widely in print; I keep searching for it every few years hoping it will be made available at some point, but it seems not to be.

860670,3,6304362498,"3.5/5 - Beautifully crafted sets and spectacular acting are marred by an inability to grasp some of the most important concepts in the novel. Particularily the Novels final, perhaps most crucial chapter.

***Be forewarned I will deal with spoilers of the novel from here-out to illustrate my point.***

I will begin with the single most important concept this film does not deal with, and that is the novels final and most important Chapter. Nineteen Eighty-Four the film almost completely ignores this final chapter. The Bookdoes far more to explain the aftermath of winstons treatment, and this is crucial to our understanding. Granted, the Books end can be perceived very different between individuals. I personally found it redeeming and hopeful of the future. The party meant to stamp the emotion, cognitive ability, and love right out of winston. Instead, they taught him how to really love, think about the world around him, and feel good natured emotion. To become a better man. The Ministry of Love had created in all their efforts exactly what they were trying to destroy. The party was falliable. It might fall, but Winston felt great gratitude towards Big Brother for teaching him these things. Winston loved Big Brother for it. Not in the way the party intended, but would he rise up against them? I do not know. The film did little to express the ideas of this chapter, and I would have had no way of formulating this idea of the novels conclusion based on it. I do not believe any viewer could come to an accurate conclusion of their personal theories of the novels final chapter based on the film. Some changes may always be necessary, even if just for keeping the running length below 3 hours, but this final chapter IMO needed to be shot word for word, scene for scene, in order, with every action maticulously displayed. The film even leaves out the crucial 'I betrayed you' comments by Winston and Julia to each other.

Many other small situational contexts were changed throughout, such as the timing of events, and characters involved. George Orwell set out events in the Book in a particular order for a reason. The changing of the timing of these events blurs the ideas a little, but not to the point of serious detrement. The film does however, botch up dealing with the Brotherhood. Little mention is ever made in the film about the Brotherhood. It was my interpretation that the Brotherhood was organised and controlled by the party. An ultimate form of control. Consider the line in the book referring that the party makes the revolution to establish the dictatorship. None of this was touched upon in the film. Winston does not bring Julia to see O' Brian, and the conversation between the three does not take place in the context of the Book. In fact, a viewer who has not read the Book may not even grasp that O' Brian is claiming to be part of the Brotherhood at all.

There are numerous other little changes I will not touch on. These two are the most important, and most detremental to a film that is among the greatest ever made in the fields of acting and cinematography/directing. The scenes involving a crowd watching the telescreen are classics of cinema.

So my verdict? Do not see this movie if you have not read the book. You will not get an acurate representation of the most important concepts with which to formulate an understanding of the material. Even Winstons time in the Ministry of Love is portrayed on a level minimal to the length of coverage given in the book. Read the book, then see the movie for it's artistic merits and to understand from what direction it was made, filling in the various holes from your previous reading. As a film not based on prior material, it would be one of the greatest films ever made, but it is based on a book, with ideas that crucially must be represented here. Some of the most important, are not.",1212624000,2,3886,4.700440528634362
860671,5,6304362498,"If there was any one single book I would peg for being inaccessible to a successful film adaptation, it would be George Orwell's ""1984"".  How could any director bring to life Orwell's cautionary, almost unbearably nightmarish literary dystopia to the screen without screwing up even in the tiniest way?  Orwell's body of work is remarkable not only for the scope of his political imagination, but the tiny idiosyncrasies of imagination which make the reader uncomfortable.

Well, kudos to Michael Radford, because he did exactly that, and then some.  This is perfect.  And I mean perfect in the classical sense; without flaw.  I remember first seeing it on the Sci-fi channel as a kid and it lodged in my memory like a tick; the scenes with Winston (played with a kind of wounded, vulnerable purity by Jonn Hurt) and the melancholy monster O' Brien (played with a chillingly resigned, Shakespearean delicacy by Richard Burton) in the party's interrogation/toture chamber are absolutely unforgettable.  Despite being his last role while dying of liver cancer, this has to be one of Burton's best performances.

The future is not some paradise filled with new invetions or moving sidewalks.  It is an impoverished, shrapnel ridden hell where Winston narrowly navigates his way to something like life, at least inside.  His job as a member of Oceania's Party is to destroy the past; he scratches out newspapers, discards photographs of party members (or not), and against his own will takes place in the gigantic Crime Against Humanity that the world has become.  Radford's aesthetic sensibilities were perfectly surreal; the telescreen of Big Brother is still, beige and illuminated, and you actually feel as though he is ""watching"".  Orwell obviously took a lot of inspiration from Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Russia; as Winston and Julia (played wonderfully by Suzanna Hamilton) stand and cheer, the man on the telescreen looks a great deal like Rudolph Hess.

Winston and Julia lose, just as in the book, and badly.  Everyone is a traitor (sound familiar?).  Burton easily takes Winston in, betrays, tortures and successfully brainwashes him.  ""Humanity is the Party"".

I cannot believe that some of the reviewers here have the guts to claim there are no parallels between this film and our world.  Just as in the movie, we are continually lied to about war, who we are fighting, and as O'Brien tells Winston, we are drugged on notions of false ""victory"".  An obvious parallel is that during one week in Winston's Oceania the country is at war with Eastasia, then Eurasia: at one period of time we are at war with Iran, the next Iraq, then as an afterthought perhaps, Afghanistan.

860753,3,6304362498,"Just coming off reading the essentialy Orwell (1984 and Animal Farm), I decided I could finally check out the film without any guilt of not having read the book already.
I have to admit, I was disapointed in alot of ways, and not just in the ""it can't match the book sense"".  First off, I was glad that the person I was watching with, and myself had both read the book in the not too distant past, or both of us would of probably been at a great loss on a number of subjects.  Many details, and elements of the 1984 world, while shown, are not adaquately explained, and would just serve to confuse the viewer more.  Elements such as the background history of the world, the thought police, newspeak, the Ministry's, the characters and their thoughts on each other, are all only touched on by minor scenes, if at all.
  In all frankness, the movie probably needed to be twice the length, with alot of narration to explain the world.  The movie often felt rushed, and the scenes at points butchered and the storyline brought to its most skeletal elements.  How they felt they would be able to bring the true horror and suspense of 1984 without Winston's thoughts, I can't fathom.
  Hopefully this will be made again, and it will get a proper full length that the classic novel deserves.  With age of fashionable radicalism in a political era thats garnered more than a few comparisions to Orwell's ""Big Brother"", its amazing that the time hasn't been taken to give this classic its proper film due.",1183766400,,1496,4.548507462686567

860755,4,6304362498,"Like most reviewers, I read Orwell's novel long before I watched this film, and I think this is the crucial point.  This is a film that clearly stands on the shoulders of the book, a film that lends visual authority and power, really, to many of the themes (and overall mood) developed in the book.  If you watch this movie without first making any headway against the novel, I am afraid you will walk away with the impression that you have just watched a rather peculiar, (but on the whole) rather forgettable film about a time-worn man searching for a way out of an absolutely pulverizing totalitarian state.  But if you watch this movie with the cheater's advantage of knowing what to look for, then the film, in my opinion, rates much better, because then you will be able to use it to sharpen and refine your appreciation of certain Orwellian themes.

What stands out about this film?  To start, I was mesmerized by the film's masterful rendering of the tone and appearance of a totalitarian state.  The air is cold and caustic, the buildings gray, cracked, and obliterated, the entire scene a rubble, like a society that awakens one day to nuclear fall-out.  The only signs of human life in this smashed landscape are the ever-present telescreens that dispense state news alerts or triumphant reports of production goals for raw materials being met.  Main character Winston Smith reflects the wider, societal degradation and decay in his deeply-lined face and burned out gaze, a twiggish man who coughs and hacks his way through daily, state-mandated calisthenics.  In short, the visual aspect of the film was, to me, the obvious highlight.

Second, I think that, thematically, the film is rich and provoking.  As with any film adaptation of a classic novel, the film has to condense its menu of ideas and its analysis of those ideas, and it is for this reason that people often mistakenly criticize a film for falling short of the book's grandeur.  But the filmmakers here raise a bundle of interesting questions, and certainly they raise the questions that deserved to be raised.  The film asks us to ponder 'By what means and measures does the state maintain its crushing grip on power?'  'How are people and society warped, physically and psychologically, when denied the power to choose?' 'How is the effort to preserve one's language and history relevant to the effort to sustain freedom and opportunity?'  'Are there any fissures in the edifice of the state, or any escape routes that provide hope for a different future?'  'Could this happen anywhere today?'  Etc.

In the end, the film provides suitable depth for most of these themes but falters with others.  Terrifyingly, the film suggests no route of escape for Winston Smith, nor anyone else.  The school-age children are indoctrinated with the lies and false logic of the state, and their youthful, bouyant loyalty surpasses even that of their parents, some of whom seem to sense somewhere in the farthest recesses of their minds that they've been made to worship a false idol, though they will never admit it.  And for those like Winston Smith, who suspect just this, the state employs ruthless techniques of coercion and re-conditioning.

One final note.  I've read many reviews of the novel and of the film, and for some reason, many people feel compelled to discern striking similarities between what Orwell wrote and what the world looks like today.  ""Look at what's happening in the US right now,"" they'll say, or ""This stuff is already happening"" etc.  Nonsense.  Orwell's warnings demand our attention, sure, but I notice today that in the good old USA, I got up at a time of my choosing, ate what I wanted for breakfast, decided not to run in a local 5k race, booted up my computer instead, checked a baseball box score, then typed a review of a film about autocratic rule.

I remember I was every excited when it showed up because I was just finished reading the book and the concepts of ""thought police"", Big Brother, totaliatarian state, etc  were developing in my mind.. I read in the paper that Orwell's window was very much into the production seeing that the true spirit of the book was held at all times... and the movie does that at perfection level.

In 1948 Orwell wrote the book to exptrapolate a world where fascism, comunism and other totalitarian forces gradually swept the world to create this dystopia... your thoughts are your own worst enemies.. they must be controlled by the message of the big-brothers and their sect of leaders in a hierarchical scale where beong a common citizen is the worst you can be .. uhmm any similarities with present state is purely coincidential

That 90% of the world's population has lived in a state no different than the medival ages, that concepts such as freedom, civility are completly alien, that the few nations that upheld such values are becoming totalitarian, this alone will tell you that we humans are build to live in a primitive state, that scientific progress has nothing to do with enlightment of the soul... that this progress can be ruthfully exploited to make harder conditions on this primitive state...those are the thoughts that this marvel of cinema show us, it is a perfect parallel to what is happening today, of our legacy to our grandchildren.

recursiveness, this is a theme xplored by Orwell that just barely now I have been able to see. The meticulous investigation into the control, manipulation and influence of human behaviour is a formidable task, yet, it is  here that no resources are wasted to carry out this at unimaginable levels, this experiment works, the brutal repression is over the point of corporal punishment for those who deviate, it has evolved into a ""humanitarian"" method of assimilation.. at the end, we can be like Winston at the end of the movie, frighten, concerned at what is being shown in the tv, wondering if as a society we are able to come through, and then the barman, comes up to us and offers us a shot of gin, it will be alright brother-

I can understand why this movie is not available now; again call me a ""conspiracy paranoid"", but now is not the best time to question status-quo, now that hey are so focused on finding the enemy of terrorism within and abroad... I thought I never see the day that the USA would give up their freedom over to a group of neo-fascist, christian puritans to convert it gradually in a totalitarian state.. they go out agaist the taliban just as we are converting to a new talibanism... no civil rights if any suspision arises, I wait 4 hours in line trying to get in the US to spend my vacations there, to be considered; just by  being a foreigner, as a terrorist threat.. while at the same time in my country the whole systems marches to a Castro like state..  Is there a place in the world for free thought now?? Is anyone out there??? helloooo... sure hope Australia is still a land of free thought.... terrorist indeed won over, they have taken away by our consent our right to freedom

(Think in terms of the controlled media and political correctness, and the Patriot Act.)History is being rewritten as we speak.

The cast is perfect: Burton, Cusack, Hamilton, Hurt seem to fit their parts exactly. It was a shock to be told that the location shots were filmed in areas of London that actually were in existence in 1984. I recognized Battersea Power Station, and London University Senate House. Those places reflect the totalitarianism of the 1930s, the decade that produced WWII. The book was written in 1948 (obviously), which was only 3 years after the ending of the war. The fact is that conditions in post-war Britain were almost worse than during the war itself. Austerity was the watchword. Rationing prevailed. Bombsite rubble was everywhere in London. Russia, the former ally, was now the enemy. Orwell was working for the BBC, and he must have developed a sensitivity to the potential ways in which the public could be deceived and manipulated. It didn't take much projecting to imagine how things threatened to develop, especially with the history of the pre-war Communist show-trials and executions, and rantings of Nazi oratory to draw on. All this is very well depicted in the film. The warning of the book was that these things weren't happening in Eurasia (Nazi Germany) or Eastasia (Russia) but in Oceania (US and UK). Airstrip One was the UK re-named: a place for transatlantic bombers to land and take off from. The national anthem was titled: Oceania,'Tis of thee. So Orwell's satire was targeting home territory. The threat of an everchanging enemy meant a way to keep the home population under control. The vision is utterly bleak. However, if the film has a flaw, it is that the visual shabbiness is almost too much. It's just a little over the top: and if the settings had been a fraction less threadbare and brutal, then thoughtcrime and its cure could perhaps have been even more chilling. Difficult to tell.

John Hurt and Richard Burton turn in solid performances, and everything about the production -- set design, costumes, etc. -- looks just as it should.  But there is something lacking in this adaptation that makes it pale compared to the book.

Orwell's _Nineteen Eighty-Four_ was, largely, _about_ reading and writing, and the power they give to people.  As such, it is a thrilling novel, and a great pleasure to read.  Seeing John Hurt writing in Winston Smith's diary doesn't quite cut it for me; the essential spirit is lost in the translation to film.

Beyond this, there are also some more mundane elements of the plot and characters that were cut to fit the screening time.  What I missed most was Smith's growing frustration with Julia being ""only a revolutionary from the waist down"" and his schoolboyish admiration (affection, really) for O'Brien.

The only real highlight of the movie is the constant voiceovers coming from the telescreens regarding the progress of the war and the rooting out of traitors.  Orwell's vision is captured perfectly here, and the woman who read the ""news"" voiceovers gets the tone exactly right.

All in all, the movie is nowhere nearly as compelling as the book, and isn't really worth the trouble.  In the time it takes you to procure and watch the movie, you could be halfway through the book.",1152835200,4,1409,4.804979253112033

According to one reviewer it was on the insistence of the Director, now grant it I do also like Muldowney's score (and own that particular s-track) and feel the newly replaced tracks work well in maintaining a bleak a-tonal atmosphere, I still sorely miss the eurythmics music and feel Radford should have left it as it is or at least made SURE MGM included a 2nd audio track version.

This could be another unusual case of an artist not being the best judge of his own work, at least in my opinion I feel the eurythmics' added a unique flavor and spirit to the film. I can understand at the time Radford may have had studio pressure to use them as was overly common practice for just about any film made in the 80's to have a slapped on pop tune soundtrack from whoever the hottest flavor of the year was. Still i think this film was an unusual exception, interesting coincidence in the same year another pop group (Toto) surprised many with a great score for Dune.",1144454400,6,1090,4.396039603960396
860844,5,6304362498,"I read the powerful and compelling novel ""1984"" in the late 1970s and I eagerly welcomed the film adaptation of the book. Watching the movie in 1984, I was thrilled by the way it brought to life the dark and grim story of life in Oceania.

The movie relates the story of Winston Smith (wonderfully played by John Hurt) who is unfortunate enough to live in the London of Oceania. For convinience, he is a member of the ruling party. He has to go through the motions to survive in a country where the party has total monopoly of power. He is daily exposed (and unwillingly participates) to the lies that are the daily bread for the people. His job at the Ministry of Information involves tampering with history and changing facts to fit the will of the party with absolutely no regard to reality.

This is a deeply disturbing film especially in view of the fact that there are people to this very day who live in circumstances not too far removed from that depicted in the movie, where Big Brother is always watching and where people are not expected to think for themselves and the umwritten party slogan is ""Ignorance is Strength; Freedom is Slavery"".

The atmosphere in the film is stiff to reflect the dark story in a stinky and dingy London. One sees bombed out builbings creating a desolate and hopeless atmosphere. The constant shortages of basic necessities of life and endless propaganda seal the misery and doom for the hapless people of Oceania.

In summary, an outstanding film with excellent acting and powerful and compelling message about the evils of communism and fascism.",1143590400,10,1587,4.697841726618705
860845,5,6304362498,"I was finally able to find this for rental and gave it a look with great enthusiasm as this is one of my favorite novels.  As this is a most talked about and studied novel what I say may not be news to anyone.  This is a great story about the evils of controlled media, the consequences of chaos in society, and the defiance of enforced solidarity.  Everyone knows the story of Winston Smith, a clerk serving in the Ministry of Truth whose function is the fabrication of propaganda that is broadcast throughout the land of Oceania.  Ironically, as Winston weaves the yarns of the ever refining past, he remembers that the facts were quite different at one time.  This is thought-crime, a newspeak term for remembering past events.  One must overide thought-crime with doublethink, to forget the past and accept the facts being told, but Winston struggles with this concept.  Winston also realizes that his struggle is not only known to himself as the dread thought police and citezenry are quick to pick up on the unorthodox actions one perpetuates in thought-crime.  Even his visits to the prole quarters would furrow the brow of any thought-police agent.  His suspicions become paramount when a young woman keeps appearing in his wayward whereabouts.  One day she ""trips"" and he helps her up.  When he takes her hand she slyly slips a love note into his hand.  This begins a secret relationship between the two that Oceanic society is working hard to abolish through the anti-sex league and community meetings.  This is the crime of ""own-life"", or the act of forming personal relationships outside of the solidarity of society.  After many lusty and secretive meetings above a junk shop in the prole area, the two are busted by means of a hidden telescreen behind an engraved picture on the wall.  A trip to the Ministry of Love, where all concept of time is dissolved and a cure rate of clients is boasted at a 100% rate, brutally dissolves their relationship of one another and re-establishes their devotion to society and the love of ""Big Brother"" (the benevolent leader wich no one is sure lives, but worship him anyway!).  All throughout the film you will understand the super media saturation in Oceania as nobody is not within earshot of the increasing lies broadcast via telescreen.  You almost feel the oppression of it all as the scenarios are all filthy and delapitated, save for the beutiful meadows of the forests of Oceania that constantly find their way into Winstons dreams and imaginations.  This film encompassed all the good points of the book but it's still wise to read the novel first.  As contradictary as 2+2=5 and that four fingers is five, this movie will definetely leave an impression (as a boot stamping on a human face forever) that the truth shall enslave you.......",1142121600,4,2799,4.8058455114822545
860846,5,6304362498,"Yeah, a masterpiece. As noted by many, 1984 is a brilliant screen adaptation of a seminal text. Most impressive is its incisive attention to detail (the film exhibits some of most masterfully created sets and costuming ever - Winston's coveralls say it all - soundtrack, editing, et al.). Further, the film is devoutly faithful to its terrifyingly prescient source. No paltry feat. Further, the acting is not merely uniformly excellent, but notable.  Richard Burton's swan song performance as O'Brien was worthy of a posthumous Oscar - capturing the duplicitous depths - and Hurt is perfectly cast as Winston.
Well, then?  How many people actually have seen the film - which - in my opinion was the best of the crop that year (I actually saw it within weeks of its release in Los Angeles on the big screen, on an evening where it played to a half-empty theatre). I thought it was great.  But then, again, I voted against Reagan.
I was amazed how short 1984's actual run in the theatres was.  The loud and brassy Terminator was a much bigger hit.  I am as yet amazed at the overwhelming price tag on the DVD. But . . . I am since better educated. No mistake why the film was made in 1984 . . . it simply happened to coincide with the period when John Poindexter and other extremists in the American intelligence community were laying the foundations for the controversial programs of the NSA and CIA as they are today.  My claim is that the film has been supressed - on the assumption that most Americans who haven't read the book - and actually, unfortunately that is most - won't.

860906,4,6304362498,"I have to admit that I was one of the few people who saw this film without having first read the book. (Most British students get this opportunity at secondary school.) The lack of a feel-good ending, coupled with all the controversy over the Eurythmic's soundtrack vs. the original orchestral score, made it a less than satisfying experience.

Since then, I have read the book a couple of times, and it is now one of my all-time favourite novels. Orwell invents an entire political system which is utterly believable in every detail. However, in the novel, the 'proles' clearly have a better time of it than party members; despite official neglect, they are allowed to have a much more natural life-style ... and death. The film virtually ignores the proles entirely.

In the novel, Winston has many dark subconscious urges -- e.g. wanting to smash the skull of the dark-haired girl, and thinking about pushing his wife off the cliff. He discovers memory fragments in his subconscious, of a time before IngSoc. In the film, these elements aren't really there. John Hurt portrays a rather agening but innocent 39-year-old, without any dark thoughts, or any leg ulcers or varicose veins. Instead we get a curious recurring dream where he is escorted by Richard Burton's O'Brien along a tunnel leading to a green landscape.

The surprising aspect is how well the Eurythmic's soundtrack stands up after 20 years. It's a muted, ambient mix that anticipates an era of treated pop music by nearly ten years.

Fortunately most societies have turned away from the totalitarian state that Orwell envisaged. The uniformity and utter obedience required, coupled with the 7x24 monitoring of our every move, now seems closer to the existence many of us experience in large institutions and corporations.",1128384000,6,1790,5.016835016835016

As a previous reviewer pointed out, this is going to lead to big gaps for someone who doesn't have a clue as to what the characters are referring to in the movie.

The film did a so-so job of bringing to life the picture of the totalitarian world of Oceania and of Winston Smith's love affair and his thoughtcrimes of actually remembering bits and pieces of his childhood and trying to find who *he* was and not who Big Brother wanted him to be.

In Richard Burton's last film, he played a wicked O'Brien but you could feel the lack of chemistry between him and John Hurt.  This was especially evident during Smith's ""reeducation"" in the Ministry of Love of the ways of Big Brother and who Oceania was at war with (which kept changing every 5 seconds).

Well, I have good news for you.  The British DVD from MGM features the Eurythmics/Muldowney score as you fondly remember it!  In my opinion, the slip cover art and menu design on the British MGM DVD is also far superior to MGM's North American release.

The only catch, however, is that the British DVD release is of course in Region 2 PAL format, so you will require a DVD player which supports that particular region-coding and PAL format (I bought a multi-region DVD player from an online vendor over a year ago for under $100 and it works like a charm!).

The differences between the North American and British MGM DVD releases of ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"" are as follows:

* The North American MGM DVD is widescreen with an anamorphically enhanced 1.85: 1 aspect ratio; the color is brighter and more saturated.

* The British MGM DVD is also widescreen with an anamorphically enhanced 1.85: 1 aspect ratio; the color is desaturated to give the movie a decidedly gloomier tone.

* The North American MGM DVD features 20 chapter stops and runs 110 minutes in total.

* The British MGM DVD features 16 chapter stops and runs 106 minutes in total (I did not notice any cuts or scenes missing from the movie itself, perhaps the shorter length on this DVD is simply due to fewer credits tacked on at the beginning and the end).

* The North American MGM DVD has only one audio track: original English-language with the Muldowney-only soundtrack in MONO.

* The British MGM DVD includes an option of FOUR different spoken-language audio tracks to choose from: the Eurythmics/Muldowney soundtrack is featured on the original English-language and French-language audio tracks; it uses the Muldowney-only soundtrack for the German-language and Spanish-language audio tracks.  All audio tracks on this DVD are MONO.

* The North American MGM DVD includes optional English, French and Spanish subtitles.

* The British MGM DVD includes optional English, French, German, Spanish, Dutch, Swedish, Finnish, Portuguese, and Turkish subtitles.

* The theatrical trailer on the North American MGM DVD is more subdued and features the soporific Muldowney score with a British announcer advertising the movie.

* The theatrical trailer on the British MGM DVD is flashier with the Eurythmics song ""Sexcrime"" blaring throughout and features an American announcer advertising the movie as ""coming to a theater near you"".

860910,4,6304362498,"This adaptation of George Orwell's 1984 is relatively faithful to the novel, and creates the same type of pessimistic and frightening view of the future. Winston Smith, who is played aptly by John Hurt, works in the Ministry of Truth editing the past and present by eliminating and retracting facts from news articles. The citizens of Oceania live in constant surveillance under the authority of Big Brother. The ideals of Big Brother shun individualism and free thought; uniformity and totalitarianism rule. Winston feels a need to keep a part of his individualism, so he secretly does acts that would violate the laws of Big Brother. For instance, he secretly goes into a store and buys a journal so he can record his thoughts despite his thought that he might get caught by the Thought Police. He eventually meets and has a dangerous affair with a woman named Julia, who also rejects the notions of Big Brother. Together they try to maintain independence while living in this totalitarian society. Eventually Winston has a meeting with O'Brien, one of the men who also works in the Ministry of Truth. However, Winston does not know everything about O'Brien, and this will eventually lead to his downfall.

Overall, this movie brings to life the image of a negative future that Orwell was trying to depict in his work. The city is not the rosy picture that we often see for the future; it is bleak, filled with a depressing atmosphere and people who are under the constant strain of ""fitting into"" the roles of citizens. John Hurt does a commendable job of bringing Winston's character to life, especially the last part of the film where his ""transformation"" of character is complete.

860912,5,6304362498,"This version of Orwell's world captures all that made the book so memorable. The translation from the book's verbal form to the movie's visual one succeeds at every level.

The city is still deep in the rubble of some past war. Its population is ant-like, dark uniform figures scurrying across a landscape too big for them, shaped by totalitarian forces that are also too big for them. Everywhere, every day, voices blare. Every place, even homes are subject to video surveillance. Everywhere, except the the slums of the lower classes. Those are the places for prostitution, grey-market exchanges, and guilty trysts.

Winston, the central character, is willingly seduced by Julia. In a world trying to stamp out the family and even the body's innate pleasures, this is the worst of crimes. No wonder, when Julia first strips off her uniform coverall, that she seems to undress as an act of defiance, even aggression. They are drawn to each other, and try to figure out what affection means. It is incredibly sad - Julia, in an antique print dress, with inept lipstick and makeup, trying to reconstruct what romance might have been.

The couple is captured. There is no trial, no interrogation. There is no execution - the crime of being human is too severe to punish with mere death. Instead, Winston's mind is crushed under torture, and he is remade as a loyal citizen.

The fact that this movie was released in the acutal year 1984 is certainly no accident. It's a bleak vision, and was all too believable when Orwell first wrote it. It's still believable today, even though the literal 1984 has come and gone.

Thankfully, America was riding the crest of the Reagan Revolution with Bruce Springsteen's ""Born in the USA"" playing on the radios (for a few older hippies, that WAS ""1984"" to them!), so I think the film has found its audience in the years since, and rightly so.

It is decentralization of power from the human being, in all aspects of one's life, to a higher power, a bigger cause, communism called the great Lucifer because all was given to the collective body and not to God, now God is the great Lucifer because we give ourselves to the collective body of something that we can not prove, so Science is the great Lucifer, producing weapons to kill the world a million times over, toxins to poison us a million times over, are all forms of giving to a collective body the nature of death? Is it the giving to a collective body that robs the soul of its power? Is it giving oneself wholly and utterly to something other than one's own self the conduit of decent into the investment of despair. 1984 sees men and women working their themselves to skin and bone to achieve a greater good that never emerges, the ultimate failings masked by a strict authoritative regime, BIG BROTHER, the power all seeing and ever controlling, rewriting history, editing the world around them, at war with this nation one minute and switching to another the next, neighbours up and vanish and protagonists invest in each other for but a fleeting glimpse of love only to be captured by the THOUGHT POLICE for engaging in illegal activity, men at the top of this society using torture and mind control to enforce a pathology of unquestionable and undeniable supremacy of all the power to the BIG BROTHER system, and that this is the system and that is why they are alive at all, at which point we question if it is worth living at all to which Orwell delivers a resounding, no, of course it is not worth living this life, why bother at all, and that this is a piece of work that must be understood by everyone and anyone who can read and is certainly mandatory reading for anyone in least bit interested in politics or political science.

Unfortunately however we tend to vote in military commanders, lawyers and extreme capitalists into government and then ask why it is all going down hill.

The problem is there is no terminology in the English language to describe the act of one human being killing their unborn future children by process of setting up a bad management system with a legal body incorporated into that system before they die.

860981,5,6304362498,"I saw this film when it first came out in 1984 and was very impressed with it. It is probably the best film adaptation of a novel, ever. It captures all of the gloom, claustrophobia, and paranoia of Orwell's world perfectly. Each scene seems to jump right off the pages of the book. The casting was particularly good: John Hurt, Richard Burton, and Suzanna Hamilton each fit their roles like a glove. In fact, I recall reading the book for the first time in the early 1970's and imagining Richard Burton in the role of O'Brien: the role that he later played.

Having said this, I purchased the DVD version with some trepidation, as many of the Amazon.com reviews I had read complained about the substitution of a classical score for the original Eurythmics score, at the request of the director, Michael Radford. Having now seen both versions, I can say that I liked the Eurythmics score a little better. It created an edgy, surreal atmosphere which fit the story well, as everything in this world which Orwell created is a lie. However, the difference is minor: both scores are rather muted and subdued. Don't let the score substitution stop you from buying the DVD. I have always believed that this film has been underrated by critics and filmgoers alike. The principal criticism is that the film (especially the second half) is very bleak and depressing. As Orwell's story is about the dehumanization of individuals living under a Totalitarian Communist regime, I don't see how it could be anything but bleak! I applaud Michael Radford for staying true to Orwell's vision, and creating this great film. Imagine if 1984 were remade by Hollywood, today. Winston Smith would be played by Brad Pitt or perhaps Denzel Washington. Julia would be played by (who else?) Julia Roberts (No nudity: this would violate the actors contracts, earn an  NC-17 rating, and offend the largely American audience).

I guess that the movie was faithful to the original work of Orwell. there is no doubt that Orwell wrote the book to attack the totalitarian governments. During his lifetime Orwell saw such governments in USSR and aimed at criticizing the ploicies of totalitarian states. 1984 was a book to be pointed at if you liked to tell people to read something that highlights the individual as a helpless creature facing the tyranny of the state. But after USSR dissolved and USA became the only power in the world one can't help thinking about Lord Acton's words ""power tends to corrupt; absolute power corrupts absoluetly."" The systematic process of brainwashing that is depicted in Orwell's 1984 is paralleled by the USA today:information distorted; American ideology justified (wars in the name of Christ and human rights); media is herded and is herding the masses..etc. The irony is that Orwell's 1984 was once used by capitalists and Americans to attack USSR and communism.

Take this movie for what it is, an exceptional adaptation and piece of filmmaking.

The only complaint that I have agaisnt the film is that it might be a little confusing to a viewer who hasn't read the book.  However, I truly mean that that's my only complaint about the film.  John Hurt is spectacular as Winston Smith, perfectly displaying Winston's inner turmoil and gaunt appearance.  Eqaully spectacular is Richard Burton, in his final film role, as the enigmatic O'Brien.  Suzanna Hamilton is decent as Julia, not unrealistically beautiful and with a flippant sense of rebellion that is her charm.  The sets of a bombed out London are extremely convincing: never does the viewer question this decrepit and depressing dystopia.

Although some of the things added to the film were surprising (the physical crossing of the arms to make a ""V""), some actually improved on the novel, an example being the set-up of Winston's deep fear for rats.  The physical likeness of Big Brother, an amalgam of historical tyrants, is well done, and the soundtrack (done by Eurythmics of all people) perfectly suits the film.

The story goes that when Eurythmics attended the London preview which featured the now DVD version of the soundtrack, they thought it was a joke. Sadly, this was in fact the director's vision of what might otherwise have been a really powerful realization of Orwell's famous novel. After a legal suit, Eurythmics won out and director Michael Radford was forced to honor his own advance publicity and include Eurythmics soundtrack for the public release of the film. Because he had never intended to use the soundtrack at all, the original cut of the film (available on VHS) is hauntingly silent, devoid of music except for the very odd and occassional moment where Eurhtymics soundtrack makes an appearence. This is the film I remembered, a retro-futuristic examination of Orwell's work. Eurythmics' music was powerful and unsettling and really stands on its own as a studio recording (for those who are fans of 80s techno-pop)- keeping in mind that the lp release of the sound track was sooped up for the dance-floor. All in all, Radford's original/DVD vision of this story was hoakey and uninspired. Had he stuck with the material Eurythmics brought to the film, he might have had a real daring film on his hands.

861015,2,6304362498,"A film by Michael Radford
Clever.  Very clever.  This movie was filmed in 1984 during the months that were specified in George Orwell's novel.  It was also released in 1984.  This fit perfectly with the title and gave a nice contrast between Orwell's vision of the future and what the world was like at that very time.  The question, however, is: Is ""1984"" any good as a movie?  Well, yes and no, and it has everything to do with what was included in the movie.
The year is 1984 and the setting is London.  At least, the city used to be London.  Now it is just a city in Oceania.  Oceania is a communist style society where propaganda rules the day and history is re-written daily to reflect the views of ""The Party"".  One day Oceania may be at war with Eurasia, and the next Oceania is at war with East Asia and has always been at war with East Asia.  History is changed and officially, the past never happened if ""The Party"" says that it didn't happen.  Winston Smith (John Hurt) is a worker.  It is his job to change history's headlines.  Through Winston's eyes we see ""The Party"" outlaw personal relationships, emotional attachment, and even thought that does not mirror the party line.  The latter is called ""thought crime"".
Winston is a thought criminal.  He secretly writes in a journal about the revisionist policies and he visits a store that sells (on the sly) items that are older than Oceania (one piece is said to be 100 years old).  Winston is secretly seditious and he meets Julia (Suzanna Hamilton), who, like Winston, is defying Oceania as she can.  Her method is sex.  Sex for pleasure is highly illegal and this is the foundation of their relationship.  We know that a movie set in a world with this sort of a society, they have to be caught because we have to no what the repercussions of their actions will be.
The main difference between this film and the novel is simply that in the film we are seeing what Orwell described, and in the book all we have is the words of George Orwell.  The reason this is a difference is that in the movie we know what a thing looks like, but not what it is.  One example of this is the ""two minute hate"".  Orwell describes several scenes in which the workers are given a forum where they must vent and scream and express their hatred for the enemies of Oceania.  It is a form of social control.  We get a sense of what is going on, and why.  In the movie, we see what happens and how it affects the workers, but the detail which makes the scene meaningful is missing.  This is fairly typical of the film and is the biggest flaw.  If I hadn't read the novel, the film would be confusing and meaningless.  It is only because I have read the source material that I know what these scenes are and why they are important.  We do get a good sense of the type of society that Orwell envisioned as a potential future, and the visualization of the characters and the world is excellent.  It is just lacking the meaning that is available in Orwell's text.  Film is a different medium than a novel and a movie should not be dependant on the novel to make it comprehensible and meaningful.  Unfortunately, ""1984"" fails in this regard.  It is faithful to the source material, but the film can't succeed without the novel.

Even the phrase ""Big Brother is watching!"" is commonly used.
  Winston Smith's (John Hurt) daily routine is getting up by an alarm, exercise, go to work, listen to ""Big Brother"", go home and more ""Big Brother"".  Inside your home, you must be in sight of the big screen.  Big Brother's face is constantly there, but no one as ever met him or seen him anywhere.  You must listen to what Big Brother is saying at all times even when you are outside his voice is heard.  If you are not in sight of your screen, you will be told to get back in sight. There are no drama or comedy programs.  Just real life.  You can exercise live and you can see an arrest made live. No music programs.  At work, Winston has a little t.v. on his desk because Big Brother must be seen and heard.  Winston's job is to re-write and proofread past and present history.  Articles are condensed in one sentence if possible.  ""Doublespeak"" is used.  Words and other information is altered.  Even two words can be condensed.  When Winston is finished, the original, historical and valuable piece of information is destroyed forever.  Similar to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Logan-s-Run/dp/B0013LL2Z2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Logan's Run</a>&nbsp;(1972), book published in 1967)], everyone must gather into a giant room, there is a big screen of Big Brother there.  People usually scream at the screen with ""his face"".  Others are quite serious and quiet.  You must live by Big Brother's orders or else.  Winston wants to get out. To see if an outside exists.  He has once heard of a land without Big Brother.
  Richard Burton plays ""O'Brien"".  This was Burton's last film role and he died during production, ironically in 1984.  Bob Flag is the face of ""Big Brother"".  After viewing this film, you might realize how close we might be to Orwell's story.
  As long as their is a President of the United States, a Queen or King of England, and His Holiness the Pope, this ""1984"" story will never fully happen.

861019,5,6304362498,"This movie/DVD captures the spirit of Orwell's novel more perfectly than almost any movie I have ever seen that was derived from a book.  The film perfectly captures the sense of dispair, the dingy physical lives of the people, the omnipresence of a malevolent Government, all of which constitute the main theme of the story.
William Hurt turns in quite literally a perfect performance as Winston Smith, the main protagonist of the story.  The cinamatography of the film is brilliant, and perfectly captures the dingy, ratty existence of life in the ultimate totalitarian/socialist state.  The constant background harangue of the Party via the telescreens is perfectly done.  If Orwell had lived to see this film I believe that he would find little or nothing to criticize.  It brilliantly captures the novel for the silver screen.
Without giving anything away, this is the story of one Winston Smith, a citizen of ""Oceania"" which is one of three superstates that dominate the world.  (Oceania is comprised of Britain, the Americas, and Australasia; its adversaries Eurasia and Eastasia are of similar size and power).  The Government dominates and controls everything through the ""Party"" which promotes the doctrine ""Ingsoc"" (derived from ""English Socialism"").  Everyone, even the elite, live in a ramshackle dingy world in which shortages of everything is the norm--it is a world in which ""nothing is cheap and plentiful.""  (Basically your socialist state taken to the nth degree).  Winston works in a pointless job that involves constantly re-writing old archives to conform to present ""realities"" as defined by the Party.  Love is forbidden other than love of the Party and its leader (""Big Brother"") and the ""Thought Police"" ruthlessly root out anyone who fails to conform to the requirement of strict orthodoxy and Party loyalty.  The fact that Winston is such a one is the central theme to the story.  When he falls in love with a beautiful young woman, his troubles begin in earnest.
To properly appreciate this film, the viewer should of course first read the book.  I would imagine that the film would be somewhat bewildering to one who was not familiar at least with the novel's basic theme and premise--the dispair of life under the ultimate totalitarian state.
This is not a film for the whole family to enjoy together.  It is intense and depressing.  The final portion of the movie, involving Winston Smith and O'Brian (Richard Burton in his final role) is long, unhappy, and downright dreary.  Although utterly necessary as an essential component of the story, it both drags and depresses.
1984 is essentially the story of the ultimate result of allowing Government (any Government) to run our lives, and what will happen if the people substitute trust in Big Government for the love of liberty and freedom.",1083456000,8,2822,5.073593073593074
861020,4,6304362498,"I have only seen the VHS version, and am looking forward to seeing the DVD in light of the reviews here. Having seen the film over a dozen times, I feel safe sharing a few observations.
1. As others have pointed out: If you've never read Orwell's 1984, READ IT FIRST. If you don't enjoy - if ""enjoy"" is the right word - or understand the book (your loss), the movie likely will do little except baffle and annoy you.
2. If you have read the book and ""enjoyed"" it, see the film. Be warned: the script is not word-for-word Orwell. That'd be impossible short of a Masterpiece Theater-type miniseries (not a bad idea).
As it is, crucial and not-so-crucial elements of the novel have been compressed, altered, combined or deleted. The worst example of this probably is the novel's portrayal of Winston's entrapment by O'Brian. This potentially powerful, emotionally charged scene (which includes Julia) is inexcusably shortened and muted in the film, involving only Hurt and Burton. The movie suffers, and that's why I give it a 4 out of 5.
And it is true that the affair between Winston and Julia - while very physical - is not entirely warm, as one reviewer laments. Yet what should we expect from people born into this universe? These are world-weary individuals living with the constant dread of sure detection and destruction; they agree it must happen sooner or later. And it does. So the melancholy, futile mood of their relationship (especially on Winston's part) is reasonable and entirely appropriate, given the reality the characters inhabit. All along they're expecting to happen that which we can only hope, for their sakes, doesn't have to be. So for me, the performances work.
Despite drawbacks, the basic story IS there and would be valuable in a classroom setting to supplement (not replace!) the book.
3. Even those who read the book and hate the film must admit the cinematography captures the bleak, hopeless mood of the novel as well as any filmed version of a book ever has. No one who really ""gets"" the book will deny that, and it's worth seeing for that reason alone. I personally can't recall another movie that so consistently mirrors the look and feel of its source novel.
4. The soundtrack: I admit it's all I've known, but I enjoy the original. Yes, it gets in the way here and there. But think about it - the synthesizer-based music is so subtly mechanized (even the vocals) that it actually fits. Everything about the 1984 universe is false, doomed or both. And everything is soaked in hopelessness. So I agree with other reviewers that the Eurythmics' music makes for a dreamlike, surreal vibe that on the surface does not seem to fit at all...but does.
Incidentally...I've often wondered what the film would be like with no music at all, save the Party's broadcasted anthems, marches and whatnot. Think about it!
Also...the way the plaintive ""Julia"" plays over the final blackout of the end credits (vhs) is nothing less haunting. Some of you know what I mean. If not, listen to the lyrics - they  mesh perfectly with the final winter scene of the book (how I wish they'd shot the final conversation between Julia and Winston outside in the cold, gray wind where it should be, instead of inside the cafe...imagine THAT scene!). Still, that song - more than anything else in the film - is what's stuck with me ever since I first saw this movie. Knowing it's gone from the DVD gives me the hunch that I'll end up voting for the VHS.
Still, I look forward to seeing the disc...who knows, I may prefer it. They told me I'd hate the so-called ""director's cut"" of Blade Runner, which removed Decker's running commentary and that tacked-on, sunny epilogue. But they were wrong!
So if you've not seen 1984...read and familiarize yourself with the book, THEN see the movie. If you can't get into the book, the film probably will waste your time. If you can see both the DVD and the original VHS, do so - it should make for an interesting comparison.
And if you end up depressed after seeing the film, it will have done its job. It's 1984 more and more all the time, you know.",1079740800,5,4094,4.662517289073306

The film is about a government called ""The Party"" that uses the media coverage of a war as a way to manipulate the past, present and future of mankind as a form of control. Those who question the ""reality"" (the media) are called ""traitors"".  For some this film may require a second viewing not because it is not comprehensive, but because the film its self purposely manipulates the viewer.

861022,5,6304362498,"""Nineteen Eighty-Four"" (the actual on-screen title) is a rare example of a film adaptation of a book that faithfully transfers the visions and theme of the book's author, right down to even filming on the dates that the author specified (April-June 1984). George Orwell's frightening, hellish novel of a future where freedom has vanished, even from the minds of human beings, has been turned into an equally frightening film version. Its tale of a government that seeks to utterly crush the human spirit through propaganda, language, and fear, turning human beings into programmed machines, has never been more frightening than today. It is a book and movie for all times, as long as governments lie, tyrannies exist, and people surrender their freedoms in the name of fears, both real and imagined.
The casting couldn't be more perfect. John Hurt, looking worn and stretched past his years, is the ideal actor to play ""little rebel"" Winston Smith, who dares to think against the mysterious Big Brother and to fall in love. In his last film role, Richard Burton is like a glaring Greek Statue, stern and unflappable and scary. It's an unnerving and great performance. As for Suzanna Hamilton, Winston's love Julia, I was shocked when I first saw the movie: she matched exactly the image of Julia I had in my head when I read the book.
Director Michael Radford (who also directed ""Il Postino"") imagines the world of George Orwell exactly as the author would have if he had directed the film: as a wrecked vision of late-40s Britain if it had lost World War II. The set design is stunning, combing some high technology (video screens and computers) with rusty mid-forties technology (pneumatic tubes, rotary phones). Everywhere is decay and deprivation. Nothing really works, everything is bland and ugly in that awful, gray-stone block style that dominated Soviet and Chinese government architecture of the 1940s and 1950s. No doubt about it, the director understood where Orwell was coming from, and the models he was using.
Just like the book, ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"" is a film that will utterly devastate you, get under your skin, and change the way you look at the world. It is a masterpiece.
(A note on the disc: Although they receive credit, the music by the Eurythmics has been completely removed, as per the wishes of the director. Since this is a no-frills DVD without much in the way of extras, there is no alternate music track to let people hear the original theatrical soundtrack. However, the film is much much better without the Eurythmics; they don't fit the style and feel of the film or the wonderful original music. Also, the washed-out photographic style of the original released has been changed to a more natural look; but this has been true of every version since the theatrical release. None of this should prevent you from getting hold of this wonderful movie.)",1076025600,136,2884,4.924024640657084

The look and feel of the technology is also tangible and authentic.  The film's original weak point, as others have noted, wass the soundtrack.

861075,5,6304362498,"This chilling analogy, given by Party Member ""O'Brian,"" describes the ongoing relationship between the ""Party"" and the proletariat, in this breathtaking film version of George Orwells ""1984.""
Filmed in and around the locations described in the novel, this is the definitive screen version of Orwell's terrifying future history - aptly enough, it was filmed ""in"" 1984. Britain, or ""Airstrip One,"" has become part of the ultimate totalitarian super-state, ""Oceania"" - a place in which even Hitler or Stalin would feel uncomfortable! - and is ruled with an iron fist by a nameless bureaucrat, ""Big Brother.""
In this nightmare dystopia the proletariat lives in grinding, hopeless poverty, it has been crushed and brutalized into mindless unthinking conformity and acceptance of anything Big Brother desires. Every waking moment, thought, action and deed is controlled and directed by the State... ""War is Peace. Freedom is Slavery. Ignorance is Strength."" These are the guiding principles of the Party.
Oceania is in a constant state of war with either one of two other super-states, Eurasia or Eastasia. Traitors confess their sins publicly on huge view-screens, and are then executed in public, by either hanging or a bullet in the head in front of baying hysterical crowds; children inform on their parents, friends and lovers on each other.
In this dismal world exists ""Winston Smith,"" a low-level functionary in the ""Ministry of Truth."" The Ministry's business is, obviously, anything but ""truth;"" Winston spends his days in a drab and soulless ""cubical farm,"" altering the past to make it conform to the Party's vision of the present. ""Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past,"" is the Ministry's slogan.
Winston's problem, of course, is that he KNOWS much around him is a lie, because he helps to WRITE those lies! As well as the official ""Truth,"" he also writes THE truth, HIS truth, in a diary he hides in his decrepit rat-hole apartment... just one of an endless litany of forbidden acts. In this small way, Winston starts to rebel against the State; something he knows could lead to his destruction. Events start to snowball out of control when he meets a girl, Julia, and the two of them engage in ""Sex Crime,"" a none-state sanctioned union, punishable by the severest measures.
In a world of constant surveillance and betrayal, there's a heartbreaking inevitability to the lover's discovery and arrest, which moves the film into truly horrifying territory. Up `til now the story has been broadly concerned with how the State controls ""society"" as a whole, but now we see how the full might and machinery of the State is used to break the individual... the boot stamping on a human face. The film now becomes a two-hander, Winston and his interrogator, O'Brian, played by John Hurt and Richard Burton respectively.
It is almost impossible to over-praise the performances of the two actors! Hurt, as Winston, is so believable, so right for the part, both physically and in his acting abilities; he makes the character come alive, so you really CARE about his fate. And Burton, as O'Brian, is a revelation. Burton was an actor who had a tendency to chew the scenery - which is not a bad thing! - and could so easily have created a monstrous, Nazi style caricature. But instead he gives a controlled and restrained performance, letting his sonorous voice create the character, and in a wondrous performance, we see the banality of true evil. In one chilling scene he even offers the hope of release to his wretched victim, telling him with a smile that, ""...in the end, we will shoot you."" This was Richard Burton's last film role, and as a swan song, I don't think he could have wished for a better part.
So much of ""1984"" has become part of popular consciousness, ""Big Brother"" style surveillance, ""Thought Police,"" ""Thought Crime,"" ""Newspeak,"" ""Doublethink,"" and the ultimate horror of ""Room 101,"" that I'm sure many people think they know the story even if they've never read the book or seen the film. This film is quite possibly the best screen adaptation of a novel ever, just don't expect a happy-happy joy-joy Hollywood ending! Like its source material, the film is grim and disturbing... and I would recommend it without reservation!!!",1073779200,2,4295,5.0
861076,4,6304362498,"As a film designed to warn audiences about a bad-case scenerio, 1984 (like the Orwell book it was based on) is an excellent instance of what Aristotle called ""deliberative rhetoric""--a piece meant to urge people to consider what they should do (a) to achieve future happiness and/or (b) to avoid future misery. Orwell, who was dying of cancer while he wrote the book, was NOT writing science fiction to entertain people, nor was he attempting to ""predict"" the future. Following World War II, he saw disturbing trends in England and the other victorious nations: sophisticated techniques were being used to manipulate the masses to react in ways desired by politicians and businessmen. Orwell feared that the Allies' governments and businesses would become the new enemies of their own citizens. Writing in 1947, Orwell chose the date 1948 and merely reversed the last two numbers to set his tale of despair and disillusionment in the near future, 1984, hoping that common people would wake up and AVOID any similar unhappy fate. Winston Smith (well played by John Hurt in this version) is a kind of generic good person we are meant to root for as he rebels in little ways against the control of Big Brother. Orwell's strategy is to horrify us by having Smith and his lover get caught and have their spirits totally crushed. When evil triumphs (and Richard Burton does an excellent job here), we, the audience, are supposed to react with anger and indignation: in this case, back in 1984 (the year this film was released) we were meant to go out of the movie theaters and take action to FIX what is wrong in our society. Alas, as Aristotle says, no persuasive technique is foolproof. Neither the original book nor any film version of it has done much to wake up most people to the dangers of the wide-spread deception and manipulation that are still with us. (Other films/novels that use this same shock strategy to try to give us different wake-up calls are COOL HAND LUKE, ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS, and FAHRENHEIT 451.)",1072483200,2,2050,4.777464788732394
861077,5,6304362498,"Almost everyone is familiar with George Orwell's novel NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR--either you read it of your own volition, or you had to read it in a high-school or college literature class--so it would be redundant to recount the basic plot here. Two major theatrical versions of the novel have been proffered to the English-speaking public: Michael Anderson's 1984, released in 1956, and Michael Radford's NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR, released (appropriately) in 1984.  Anderson's 1950s edition is rather dull and lacks the severity of the novel, but Radford's more recent film is about as close as one could possibly get to directly translating Orwell's literary vision to the silver screen.
The novel is meant as a warning about how the human spirit, and therefore humanity's future, degrades and deteriorates under strict, ruthless totalitarianism.  Orwell's description of life under a strong-fisted dictatorship is bleak, drab, and colorless, and the novel's protagonist, Winston Smith, and his fellow citizens are described as being barely more than animate skeletons.  Radford creates the visual equivalent by peopling his NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR with reflections of the victims of Nazi concentration camps, and the quality of life in his Oceania is hardly much better.  Even the architecture is severe and cold, the clothes that people wear are rag-like and virtually colorless, and the homes and offices of even government employees like Smith look old and unhealtfully dirty.
John Hurt is perfectly cast as Winston Smith.  Not only does he look thin and gaunt, but his superb acting skills allow him to portray Orwell's antihero with an inner despair that the audience can actually feel through his face and physical bearing.  Suzanna Hamilton is also a good choice for Smith's love (or lust?) interest, Julia.  She is attractive enough to make it believable that Hurt's Smith would desire her, yet she is also able to bring to life Orwell's vision of Julia as a hedonistic anti-establishment rebel.  Best of all, though, is the casting of Richard Burton as O'Brien, the Ingsoc Inner Party official who ultimately betrays Smith.  Burton maintains a stoic air throughout the film, remaining calm and mild even as his character tortures Smith, and his O'Brien, as in Orwell's novel, is eerily unsettling.
The DVD from MGM offers an anamorphic widescreen digital transfer from a quality print, but it is short on extras (theatrical trailer only).  However, this is such an outstanding film version of a literary great that the lack of extras should not deter film buffs or Orwell fans from adding the DVD to their collections.",1070236800,4,2620,5.246411483253588

I am rather disappointed with the DVD, however. Earlier on in DVD production, this would have been a fine edition. But that was then, and this is now, and there's no reason or excuse for a DVD to be this shallow, especially with a movie like this. Im sure they will re-release it in a better version with two or three discs and all that stuff, but until then, making a DVD with a trailer for the special feature and a MONO SOUNDTRACK - MONO FOR CHRISSAKE!! Where are the edited scenes, commentaries, documentaries, and all that good stuff?? If they had no time to make it, or no access to it, they SHOULD HAVE WAITED before they released this.
They can do better than that. This movie deserves it, and the current version does not do the film any justice. They did the same thing with Alien 3, Clockwork Orange (although those are in for being changed), etc. There's no excuse for it these days.",1069372800,13,1168,4.387096774193548

The fact that most Americans had no problem giving away their allegedly cherished Bill of Rights, in exchange for some vague promises of protection against the number one hundred something cause of death, is a reason for an urgent alarm, I believe, and resonates the warnings of 1984 in a truly eerie way. The movie 1984 depicts the horrors of the orwellian vision of upcoming totalitarianism with no mercy shown to the viewers: it is stunningly realistic and cruel. While not a pleasant movie to watch, it leaves a lasting impression, as it is the ultimate masterpiece with moral and political messages of the utmost importance, therefore highly recommended to anyone not planning to emmigrate to another planet or galaxy in the near future.

The music is good, but could have been better if done in Dutch as to bring the taste of WWII into this. Well acted, but I didn't like the actress(forgot her name) since she could have lived her role better than this. The movie is not long, though its very precise and there's not one minute wasted on nothing. I'd expected more personal scenes for the main guy, to remind you of the book.

The sounds reflect a feeling of seperation; a feeling of becoming disengaged!  We unfortunately do not get to hear this orginal score.  For a movie as wonderfully made as this one and considering the fans of the Eurithmics original sountrack, I feel MGM needs to be more considerate of this work of art and give people the option to hear both versions of the film.  This can be easily achieved with the DVD format, yet this very important option was left out.  Watching this DVD with the altered sountrack is like eating a vinyl sushi window display.

861082,4,6304362498,"Michael Radford's production of ""1984"" is not a typical Hollwood/bastardization of George Orwell's classic novel--thank the Lord that Radford was not forced, as was Terry Gilliam with ""Brazil,"" to alter this bleak picture of a posssible future world as seen from 1948--the year Orwell wrote the novel.
  In this version--there have been a few others--care was taken to be faithful to the novel, and the producers appeared to have a freehand to shock the audience with both the novel's sexual aspects & the inhumanity of O'Brien and the other members of the Inner Party.  (Note--the film is worthy of its rating and might have gotten an X or NC17 in a more puritan society.)  The acting of John Hurt is outstanding and Richard Burton's last tole proves to the viewer how good an actor Burton was when given a good script and a good director.
  There has been some some complaints about the lack of the music by the Eurythmics.  Having seen both versions of the film and owning a cassette of the Eurythmics contribution, I feel that the film works better without the additional music.  (Note--their work was fine and ""Julia"" was a haunting song.)  I say this because in such a world as Orwell and Radford depict, I feel that the only music that fits is the music that the Party allows--songs written by machines and the song of the children, the telescreen's fanfare and the Oceania anthem.  These small pices of music tell the whole story and thie limited use helps to create the bleakness of a society based upon a boot continually striking a human's face and the need to worship Big Brother.

861115,4,6304362498,"1984 is an exceptionally successful adaptation of a well known novel, which is perhaps the best way of understanding its qualities. Brilliantly designed, directed, shot and edited, the film brings Orwell's nightmare vision of a decaying Oceania to tangible life. It is difficult to decide which to praise more, the film's technical achievements, the concisely condensed script that economically dramatizes most of Orwell's themes, or the superb performances. John Hurt manages the difficult task of taking Everyman Winston Smith beyond a literary abstraction into a fully rounded human being. Outstanding as his achievement is, however, the real kudos should go to Richard Burton's utterly soulless O'Brien, the embodiment of velvety, degenerate power hunger. Burton's last performance, it is also probably his best on film.
1984 certainly is not a movie for everyone, however. Its relentlessly downbeat tone, understated horror and slow, quiet pace are likely to turn off most viewers. The film's extreme success in conveying a sense of dank and disintegration are likely to make you want to take a shower afterwards. The torture scenes are harrowingly affective, and forget the possibility of being spared any of it. (Readers of Orwell's novel can at least get some satisfaction from reading the postscript about Newspeak, written in a reassuring past tense that establishes some distance between the story's events and the present. The film offers no such relief.)
The American theatrical release of 1984 included a score by the Eurythmics. This edition uses the original orchestral score of strings and English horn, which is considerably more understated and moody. While the orchestral score is almost *too* perfect for the film's hushed mood, the Eurythimcs track has always struck me as a little inappropriate. (Viewers interested in seeing the film with the Eurythmics score should track down a copy of the laserdisc issued a few years back.) Forced to choose, I'd opt for the orchestral score, if for no other reason than it was what was originally intended. Both scores bring different pluses and minuses, however.
If you haven't read Orwell's novel in a while, you might want to watch this film, then go back to the book to see just how much of its mood, texture and thematic sophistication the film makers have captured. 1984 is literary cinema at its best.",1056931200,2,2370,5.223097112860892

With all due respect for the director Michael Radford, the Eurythmics soundtrack is what makes this movie very, very good, in a disturbing way. I agree with other reviewers that MGM should have provided the option to choose the soundtrack. And frankly, I don't think customers should have to read about others disappointments in DVD purchases before clicking the BUY button. If the Eurythmics were not going to be featured on the soundtrack it should have been made very obvious in the ad. In fact the DVD case and the movie titles say music by Eurythmics and Dominic Muldowney! This seems to be happening a lot with DVD's. Movies hit the theaters, people fall in love with them as they are originally seen, then DVD's are sold with changes from the way they were first seen and remembered. This becomes infuriating given the cost of DVD's especially when replacing VHS tapes and getting stuck with a changed movie. I purchased this ""1984"" DVD for the Eurythmics musical score, as well as the movie itself and it's two great actors Richard Burton and John Hurt. I understand the VHS tape version has the Eurythmics soundtrack, therefore I recommend it over the DVD.
Aside from that, having read the book several times, the movie is an excellent adaptation that follows the original story in feeling and bewilderment, with only minor changes that comes with making a movie from a great novel. I urge everyone who sees this movie for the first time to read the book for many more interesting little details, all of which makes this story a very frightening one since it could become very real someday.

Orwell's 1984 contains a message for us all, and on the day this film is banned - worry.
This is one of my staple films that I like to come back to every year or so, and it's an excellent adaptation of Orwell's novel (unlike the 1954 version that I once purchased out of curiousity).
Everything in Winston Smith's London has a poverty that rival's Moscow's during the Cold War, and the element of dread of the opressive INGSOC government and the Thought Police is conveyed perfectly!
I was quite pleased that this film had finally made it to DVD, but discovered much to my chagrin that the soundtrack wasn't the same one that I had been accustomed to hearing in all these years of seeing this film.
The soundtrack that is on the VHS and premium-cable version of the film was performed by the Eurythmics, and in my opinion enhanced the surreal feeling of dread and hopelessness that is at the core of this film.
On the disc, however, is the score that the director originally wanted - in the 80's it was replaced with the Eurythmics soundtrack in the American theatrical and video releases to make it more ""marketable"".
I could understand if perhaps the disc could have contained alternate soundtrack options - since this is a bare-bones disc that wouldn't have been too difficult, I imagine, but unfortunately we don't get a choice.
I'm not saying the score the director preferred is necessarily inferior - simply that, after years and years of watching this film, my mind associates certain scenes with certain scores, and now that all that is changed...well, I guess the only thing I can do is play my VHS recording of the film while watching the DVD picture.

861177,5,6304362498,"Attention: For those who did not read George Orwell's classic dystopian novel ""1984"" in high school, college, or through personal initiative, please take the time to do so before diving into the soul shattering experience of the film version of this book, aptly titled ""1984."" I imagine that many viewers could experience lapses of extreme boredom if they do not have a sufficient understanding of newspeak, thoughtcrime, and the political dynamics of Oceania/Eastasia/Eurasia before experiencing this soul shattering film. You might even want to read a few items about communism and fascism before watching the movie. In any event, the book and film are chilling in their presentation of a world in the grip of pure totalitarianism.
Originally released in 1984, ""1984"" tells the story of Winston Smith. Smith lives and works in what used to be the city of London, before an atomic war swept away the world as we know it and ushered in the dark gloom of Big Brother. Smith spends his days working away in a booth at the Ministry of Information, constantly updating and rewriting the party organs in order to make history fit with present realities. In the course of a day's work, Winston routinely changes rationing promises, removes people labeled as ""non-persons"" from articles, and burns records. During his off hours, he sits in his ratty apartment under the constant surveillance of the state, which keeps an eye on him through a giant monitor in his living room and with hovering helicopters outside his window. Occasionally, Winston gets to attend giant party rallies where he and other members of INGSOC watch televised propaganda tapes about the endless war with Eastasia (or is it Eurasia?). Each day is bleak, filled with consumer shortages, the endless nattering of propaganda in the background (""War is Peace, Ignorance is Strength, Freedom is Slavery""), and dreams about his life as a child or a place in the countryside.
Unfortunately for Winston, he just cannot make himself accept the prevailing view, namely that one need only give oneself up to the party and never question anything INGSOC pronounces as truth. His job reconstructing history makes him acutely aware that the party lies incessantly, and in Winston's world losing faith in the party means losing one's life after visiting Room 101 in the Ministry of Love. To make matters worse, Winston catches the eye of the lovely Julia and quickly becomes embroiled in seditious activities that Big Brother more than frowns upon. After Winston falls in with a high party official named O'Brien, the downward spiral begins in earnest, leading to an interrogation that is definitely an upsetting viewing experience.
This film is by necessity an intensely character driven vehicle. Thankfully, director Michael Radford obtained the services of John Hurt and Richard Burton to play Winston and O'Brien. Hurt shines as the tortured Winston, looking as though he's on death's door while he trudges through another bland day in Oceania. Burton is properly menacing as the enigmatic O'Brien, playing his role of party thug with equal parts compassion (oddly enough) and threat. I know less about Suzanna Hamilton, the actress who plays Julia, although she does an admirable job working between two great film stars. Incidentally, this was Burton's last film role.
I loved the atmosphere of this film. Radford creates a dank, dingy London I wouldn't even think about strolling through without a full body protection suit. The ubiquitous audio and visual propaganda is a nice touch as well, creating a sense of total immersion in Winston's world. As Winston slogs through the bombed out backdrop of London on his way to work, the viewer becomes aware of the party's total grip on the people through the canard of total war. The omnipresent image of Big Brother should certainly bring a smirk to anyone familiar with Russian history, since the guy looks a lot like Lenin.
I noticed that the Eurythmics soundtrack, while advertised on the case and in the credits, is missing from the film. This did not bother me much since I first saw the film years ago and do not remember much about the soundtrack other than the excellent score by Dominic Muldowney... I feel sorry for those who looked forward to having that part of the soundtrack included in their purchase. Despite this omission, the film is very much worth the money.
Great imagery, great acting, and a great message about the evils of 20th century fascism and communism make ""1984"" a must have for any film lover. I'll watch John Hurt in nearly anything, but he really turns in a powerful performance here. Pick up this movie and watch for the warning signs!",1049760000,290,4676,5.00385109114249

It was one of the better-done film adaptations of a book that Id seen.  I was really taken with the martial music of Dominic Muldowney so I rushed out and bought  The Soundtrack  by the Eurythmics.  Well, no martial music, no nothing; just Eurythmics.  When the Muldowney soundtrack became available a few years ago I purchased it and tried to envision the film with Mr. Radfords original choice attached.  I even wrote the director to ask if it was going to be different than the 84 release (I never heard back from him).
So whats all this about soundtracks and the Eurythmics and Muldowney you ask?  When my copy of this DVD came in March 2003 I was more than pleasantly surprised with a number of things.  First, the picture quality is plusgood.  Secondly, and even though they are credited, there is not a hint of the Eurythmics on this DVD!  Thats doubleplus-phenomenal!  The film has a different feel to it, almost a nostalgic feel, that the original didn't have and that I credit to the soundtrack changes.  I know there are some that think the film should have been tampered with, but having followed the history of this film and the conflict Mr. Radford encountered with Virgin, Im very pleased that its been released in this format.  I would have liked to have seen the Eurythmics soundtrack added as an option, but it was not.
As someone said earlier; this is not the book.  It is a well-written, well-adapted, film that captures (for me) the essence of Orwells work.  I highly recommend it.",1049414400,5,1897,4.523529411764706
861179,3,6304362498,"1984 was my sophomore year in high school, so I read the book, and made a point of seeing the film when it was originally released in theaters.
The film itself is very well done and it doesn't necessarily bother me that the Eurythmics score is missing, although Julia's theme was a haunting classic as I remember it.  It was also interesting to look at Allan Cameron's production design years before he moved on to such features as Starship Troopers and Tomorrow Never Dies.  My real complaint is the lack of supplemental features.
I remember a slew of television documentaries and news reports from the year 1984 that explored the anniversary of the novel and used it as a touchstone to examine whether or not our society, government, and technologies were leading us down a similar path.  I'm sure a few of these or an original feature could have been added to the disc offering a snapshot of how things are in the 21st century compared to Orwell's vision.  There wasn't even a booklet inside the DVD package.  It also would have been nice if there had been a commentary.  If Foxy Brown can contain a commentary from director Jack Hill, then Mr. Radford could have spent an afternoon making one for this disc!
An interesting comparison disc to view with 1984 might be Minority Report.  That movie does offer a very forseeable future where technology has enabled not just the government, but advertisers to invade practially every aspect of our life.",1048118400,2,1451,4.734126984126984

A word of warning :  In an incredibly Orwellian manipulation - any remaining vestige of the original Eurythmics film score [which had been severly edited for the theatrical release] has been eliminated.  Extremely ironic in light of one of the underlying messages of the work ""Who contols the past controls the future,who controls the present controls the past.""  The absence of the Eurythmics score ultimately deflates the scenes they had been initially included in - which now have no underscore at all.",1047168000,7,768,5.169354838709677
861182,5,6304362498,"I saw this film when it was first released and was blown away by how great it was, having known the novel since I was a young boy in the 1970s and never completely grasping it until I saw this film, and having grown up a bit by then, it hit home HARD.
John Hurt makes the perfect Winston Smith, Richard Burton the perfect O'Brien.  Someone earlier in these pages makes mention that some find this film too dark, too depressing.  I think we all should be forced to watch this film at some point in our lives BECAUSE it's so dark and depressing.  First of all, 1984 the novel was George Orwell not predicting THE future but predicting one POSSIBLE future.  If you can't grasp this you might as well not bother with the novel or this film version.  Given 9/11 and recent events in our own United States (indeed ""EastAsia"" as well) if you don't get the message of this film, God help you is all I have to say.  You'll find no happy endings here if that's what you're searching for.  1984 is about loss of freedom, loss of the individual, the intellectual, and the total annihilation of human culture, ultimately.  It's about what COULD happen, not what WILL happen for certain.  I can never understand why people
can't get the message in a film like 1984 (or the novel), and realize it's George Orwell warning us of possibilities, NOT
of current or future realities.  Thus, the newly minted Patriot Act in the USA COULD become The Ministry of Truth if we let it become so.  The people who are too dim to understand this book or the film would be the first to succumb to Big Brother.
It's not just surveillance that's the issue for Orwell, it's
the government destroying all individual thought until only
servile robots remain. If that's the future you want, complain that this film is too dark, depressing and disturbing: at least you still have time, hopefully, for the message here to sink in your dim brain and maybe, just maybe, you WON'T end up like Winston Smith or Julia.  People can turn away at this film or book, can turn away from realizing the Holocaust happened, that the Khmer Rouge happened in Cambodia, etc., but if you turn away from these cruel facts you will NEVER get the message, and you are therefore in grave danger of ending up living the reality 1984 portrays.",1046908800,7,2281,4.49636803874092

However, and this infuriates me, the soundtrack of the Eurythmics which complemented the orchestral soundtrack and the visuals of the movie is completely missing!!
If you are going to put out a DVD, do it right and don't butcher it!! The DVD is ruined in my opinion. For those of you who have this on VHS and plan on getting the DVD version, you should hang onto your VHS copy if you enjoy the TRUE soundtrack.",1046822400,17,681,4.246153846153846

When the film came out on VHS the next year I was blown away by the powerful visuals.  Also I really liked the Eurythmics score. Over the years this film  became one of the most watched in my collection.
  About 7 years ago at Cinequest in San Jose I finnaly got a chance to see it on the big screen, as well as introduction and Q&A by the director.  The print was good, and the discussion excellent but there was one thing missing: the Eurythmics soundtrack!  When I asked Mr. Radford about this he stated that this copy was his own personal print and they (Eurythmics) were late in submitting the score.  Watching the DVD I noticed the score was missing on the DVD as well.  A Tad dissapointed but this film is still fantastic if different (more a sense of quiet disperation) so get it but save that old VHS copy (was it ever released in LD?).",1046390400,10,963,4.276243093922652

From the air of defeat in the bombed out streets and buildings most people would call 'ruins' to the characters played by such great actors as John Hurt and Richard Burton, Michael Radford REALLY brings the work of literature to the big screen. Filmed during the same time period as the events in the novel it is a story about freedoms, fears and love.
Still, the book IS better.
NOTE: Have now seen the DVD version.  The music from Euryhmics has been removed, which would not be bad if it had been replaced by silence, but it was replaced by a soundtrack that is bland and feels almost lazy.  Like an after thought.  Book is still better.",1045958400,4,705,4.434108527131783
861205,5,6304362498,"I have seen this film on VHS and it is perfect in every way. Not only is Hurt stellar in his portrayal of Winston Smith, but Richard Burton gives his final hurrah as the Minister of Love in George Orwell's classic. The Eurythmics add to the mix with the great title track of ""sex crime"" which is one of their best singles.
When the VHS stopped being distributed, I was devastated. You could not find this flick except at rental stores. I tried several times to find sellers of the VHS on the web with no success. Now that this forgotten movie has come out on DVD, I am in heaven. The cinematography, the acting, the whole feel of the movie are a spot on match for Orwell's dark novel of a dysfunctional future.

Complaining that this movie is too dark and depressing misses the point.  ""1984"" is not a happy novel.  I remember seeing an animated production of  ""Animal Farm"" made in 1950's that ruined that novel's intent by putting in a ""happy"" end.  Film is more than mere ""entertainment"" when it is done correctly film can illuminate the human condition or give us pause for thought.  While the bard wrote numerous comedies, (the popcorn movies of his time) he also wrote some of the greatest tragedies of western literature. A more recent example was the film ""Gattaca"" its' bittersweet ending made it a standout film.  It did not try to ""entertain"" but it was still great cinema.
This movie is almost the exact opposite of the typical Hollywood movie, especially the over-hyped action-fests that are par for the course these days. While ""MI 2"" and its' ilk are good popcorn movies a steady diet of popcorn will leave you malnourished. This film will fill your MDR of thoughtfulness and gravis for at least the next six months. Even if this movie is nothing more than a transfer of the VHS to DVD I would still recommend it. I'm buying this DVD sight unseen, which is something I rarely do. Few movies deserve to get the DVD treatment. That dreck like ""Battlefield Earth"" or ""Barbwire"" got shipped out on DVD while ""1984"" laid in cinematic limbo is proof positive that Hollywood has its' priorities screwed up.",1044921600,10,2114,4.591511936339523
861206,5,6304362498,"I have followed the career of John Hurt (one reviewer erroneously credited the lead performance in this film to William Hurt) since his brilliant performance as Quentin Crisp in THE NAKED CIVIL SERVANT.  His turn as Winston Smith in NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR ranks as one of his two all-time best film roles.  As Winston Smith, he fully communicates both the necessity and the futility of maintaining a struggle against a dehumanizing government that spends all of its resources to monitor its subjects in every aspect of their lives.  Truly brilliant work.
Richard Burton, in his last screen role, is perfectly cast as O'Brien, a high-ranking Inner Party member.  It is chilling to watch this unaffected performance, which, in my opinion, ranks as one of his all-time best, as well.
Now for the story.  Written in 1948 (last two digits of the year transposed for the title) and published the following year, NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR has a disturbingly realistic resonance to it.  There are obvious parallels between INGSOC (the ruling party) and both the German Nazi Party and the Soviet Communists, both of which were fresh in the minds of Europeans in the late 1940s.  Also, the fact that all of the action takes place in the aftermath of atomic war (again, a seemingly very real possibility at the time the book was written) lends a sense of negative prophecy to the whole affair.  In this post-war society, the individual has no value.  In fact, anything that might contribute to one's individuality is criminalized and investigated by the Gestapo-like Thought Police.  This includes private reflection and interpersonal relationships.  And that sets the stage for the rest of the story to unfold.
Early on, Winston meets a beautiful young woman named Julia.  Try as he might, he cannot resist her.  After all, he is only human--a fact which will ultimately be his undoing.  Julia, on the other hand, revels in her sexuality and feelings of love.  As time passes, they develop a relationship that seems to be based not only on sex, but genuine love and affection.  It is disturbingly touching when Winston, while holding Julia, asks if there were ever a time when what they were doing seemed ordinary.
Of course, they are eventually caught and arrested.  Winston is taken to the Ministry of Love to be interrogated and tortured by O'Brien.  Richard Burton's portrayal is profoundly unsettling because he plays it without even a hint of irony or emotion of any kind.  In fact, the only evidence of compassion in his character comes when he pats Winston on the shoulder and tells him not to give up hope because "". . .in the end, we shall shoot you.""
There is no Hollywood happy ending in this film.  No reason for hope, even.  The final words of dialog (spoken as thought in a voice-over) are truly heartbreaking.
As others have mentioned, the set decoration and photography are brilliant and lend to the realism of the film.  And the soundtrack by Eurythmics does not seem at all out of place.  In fact, the song ""Julia"", played over the end credits is especially beautiful.
I recommend this film very highly.  It is relentlessly depressing, to be sure.  But it is also quite rewarding on many levels.  Give this one a chance.",1044662400,2,3222,4.855311355311355

I was, like others in this review, both surprised and appalled to find that this landmark piece was not readilly available. For anyone who has every read the book, one must question this for it would seem that this movie was itself put in to a ""memory hole""! With the recent attacks on our freedom in the USA from our own big brother, (Bush, Ashcroft, Rumsfeld, & co.)you would think that this movie would be in great demand.
I recommend this movie,( and the book for that matter!) to any person who is concerned about recent developments in our society and about the constant erosion of our most basic freedoms.",1037577600,5,882,4.41717791411043
861208,5,6304362498,"Orwell's 1984 is a masterpiece of dystopian literature. A truly frightening look at a world that very well could have been and may still be yet to come. Michael Radford's movie is a nearly perfect adaptation, so much so that if you haven't read the book, it would probably help in understanding the complex nature of this movie. If you have read the book, you are in for a treat as the movie literally brings to life a perfect window view of the world described by Orwell.
The movie, along with the book, is a bleak look at a world dominated by the ultimate extreme of totalitarian regimes. Every aspect of people's daily life is controlled and monitored by the ever present INGSOC (English Socialist Party) and its masthead, Big Brother. The story is set in a decimated but recognizable London and revolves around the central character of Winston Smith. The basic premise is the will of one man to maintain his humanity against the overwhelming force of an inhuman system. I will avoid saying more about the story except to warn that if you are looking for light entertainment, this movie is not for you.
In short, this movie is brilliant in it own right, with riveting performances by both Richard Burton and William Hurt. The sets, cinematography and direction bring to life a fictional world in such perfect detail that I have no doubt that Orwell himself would have been astonished. Not since BladeRunner has a world been so convincingly portrayed in a movie. This movies imagery will haunt you and its story will stun you. 1984 is mesmerizing, terribly disturbing and utterly believable.",1034726400,11,1593,4.77536231884058
861209,5,6304362498,"Being one of the late Richard Burton's last fims, I was surprised this has yet to be released on DVD.. Even MORE surprised the VHS tape is out-of-print! This is an essential movie, certainly a counterpiece to Terry Gilliam's ""Brazil"", which was also released in 1985, and is drawn from the same mold as ""1984""- as a Criterion Collection volume on three DVD discs, no less...
Also, if this does get to DVD (PLEASEPLEASEDOUBLEPLUSPLEASE!), one treatment it must have, in my opinion, is that it MUST have _BOTH_ scores- Both the original orchestral score the movie was released with, and the Eurythmics' score (which the CD for has been finally reissued- Probably the Eurythmics' best album ever, and essential 1980s album, again, in my opnion), which the orchestral score replaced. One of the beauties of DVD is multiple audio tracks, and a DVD issue of ""1984"" would certainly benefit the full restoration- Perhaps with as many as 4, maybe 5 audio tracks: movie with orchestral score; movie with Eurythmics score, orchestral score only; Eurythmics score only, and audio commentary.
It is doubleplustime for ""1984"".
(Note: I have only seen portions of this movie- I've never had an opportunity to see this ever since it came out lo those many years ago, although I _do_ have the Eurythmics CD (I never did find the orchestral score on CD- odd), but what I _have_ seen, and know about this movie, I think this movie is very much an essential movie, and deserves reissue- Especisally in this day and age- 2002- it's more relevant than ever.)",1031356800,5,1536,4.844106463878327
861210,4,6304362498,"This was a peerless adaptation of Orwell's 1984.  The visuals of a London crushed under the pressures of war and a war-economy perfectly match the leads.  Here, John Hurt plays the hero, Winston Smith, looking as if he hasn't had a good night's sleep or a decent in ages.  The state of Oceania, Smith's home, is apparently the descendant of a British socialist state emerging from a WWII that never ended, though the film follows Orwell's lead in not attributing his police state to any one country.  Oceania's hapless citizens are continually repressed.  The irony?  Oceania has no laws - save the free will to break any laws that the state could conceive of.  Smith has much to do with this, since he works for the ministry that continually crafts ""newspeak"", the stripped version of english in which speech comes to resemble some abstract computer language.  With its progressively binary quality, newspeak saps imagination from language, paving the way for a society in which even talk lacks imagination.  Secretly harboring thoughts of another life, Smith meets and falls in love with Julia, but also courts the dangerous and subversive ideas of O'brien (Richard Burton, in his last role).  Ofcourse Smith's rebellion will come to a short and painful end, but not before Smith visits Room 101 where the state will demonstrate its power to crush his will.  Hurt's performance is exceptional because his eventual surrender to Big Brother rests not on the state's power to keep him an ignorant lackey, but in light of the explosive ideas that had offered him a way out.  An excellent film.",1018828800,3,1591,4.917602996254682
861211,5,6304362498,"Michael Radford's film of George Orwell's novel is perhaps the greatest cinematic adaptation ever made from a well-known literary source, and it stands out as one of the most memorable and underrated British films of the past thirty years.  Radford treats the book neither as grim political prophecy nor as  Wellsian flight of sci-fi futurist speculation.  Instead, we are presented with the ruined world of 1948 as seen through a glass darkly - NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR done straight as a kind of medieval morality play for the post-totalitarian age.  The end credits inform us, with but a modest air of self-importance, that the picture was shot ""in and around London, April-June 1984, at the exact place and time imagined by the author.""  And the uncanny meta-fictional parallels don't stop there: the actors are so close to Orwell's descriptions, they practically seem born for their roles.
Resembling a gaunt, ashen-faced figure out of Egon Schiele, John Hurt is ideally cast as Winston Smith.  As Julia, Suzanna Hamilton (first seen as a lovelorn dairymaid in Polanski's TESS and then as the paralyzed daughter in BRIMSTONE AND TREACLE) has a haunting and mysteriously stirring presence.  Beyond the bluff, two-dimensional gamine of the novel, she brings a genuine warmth, substance, and fascination to her character - a little reminiscent, at times, of a young Harriet Andersson sans the continental coquettishness.  Her pale, wiry, broad-hipped body has a simple, unaffected, even startling beauty; and in her more physically revealing scenes (there are many in the film), she radiates all the tactile sensual grace of a nude by Munch or Degas.
The late Richard Burton, featured in his last screen role, is the oracular Thanatos to Hamilton's Eros.  As the grand inquisitor, O'Brien, he inhabits this shadowy and inscrutable character with more than just a sly hint of the demon-plagued Jesuit priests he portrayed in THE EXORCIST II and ABSOLUTION.  In a maliciously Swiftian twist of irony, the famous Burton voice - the voice of classical drama, of poetry, indeed, of all that is held to be ennobling and edifying about mankind's estate - becomes a subtle and precisely modulated instrument of dehumanization.  His death shortly after completing work on the film lends it a particularly cruel and all-too-human pathos.  When he says to Hurt, ""you are thinking that my face is old and tired...and while I talk of power I am unable to prevent the decay of my own body,"" the lines in Burton's craggy, weathered face speak volumes for him.  It's an exquisite swan-song performance, patient and quietly devastating.
In addition to the superb ensemble cast, much credit is due to production designer Allan Cameron and cinematographer Roger Deakins, who shoots everything in a grainy, desaturated monochrome of blues and greys.  The stark high-contrast photography often evokes the power and purity of Dreyer and Bresson, and there is even one extraordinary shot of a battered and delirious Hurt awaiting torture that is an unmistakable homage to Falconetti's famous haircutting scene in LA PASSION DE JEANNE D'ARC.  Also notable is Dominic Muldowney's operatic score, an ingenious and even moving parody of Elgar's patriotic overtures and Prokofiev's Stalinist anthems.  But it is Phyllis Logan (the star of Radford's first feature, ANOTHER TIME, ANOTHER PLACE, and a supporting player in Mike Leigh's SECRETS AND LIES) who provides the film with one its most caustic conceits.  As the unseen voice of the Telescreen Announcer, her incessant nannyish hectoring suggests a more shrill caricature of Margaret Thatcher.
The film is impressive less for its fidelity to its source than its harrowingly vivid sense of realism, and how unobtrusively Radford manages to transcend the faults and contradictions of the novel to create an entirely plausible dystopian vision with a life of its own.  That in itself makes NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR a great and original piece of filmmaking - its seamless perfection is still practically unequaled in the English-language cinema of recent years.",972000000,86,4077,5.246153846153846

The acting is simply stunning: John Hurt should had get an oscar for this and Richard Burton is great, as usual. It's a shame that this movie it's not available. Actually I think that this film should be part of any educational system based on freedom, just to show everyone what a political system based on the so called ""social justice""(a good excuse for any totalitarianism) can do to the individual.",969667200,2,498,4.544444444444444
861245,4,6304362498,"Michael Radford, better known for the sweet-tempered (and to me, insufferably heart-tugging) ""Il Postino"", made his early mark  with this fine movie.  He and his production designer do an excellent job  in bringing the grungy half-life of Orwell's novel to the screen.  John  Hurt is, as usual, superb, although from his very first appearance he looks  so baffled and hurt (appropriate name for this actor) that I'd have tagged  him as a thought-criminal straight away.  Suzanna Hamilton is extremely  good as Julia, not just fitting my idea of what Julia would look like but  wonderfully vulnerable and real.  (Glad to see that she's gone on to do  fine work elsewhere.)  Even Cyril Cusack, who I saw on stage in Dublin as  one of the most nauseatingly indulged Shylocks ever, is great as the  mild-mannered Thought Policeman.
Special word for Richard Burton in his  last film role - quiet, gravelly, almost visibly dying, and never less than  riveting.  Shame he had to wait all his life for such a good role.
The  Eurythmics did a fair bit of the music, and I can't think of a better band  to have provided music for a totalitarian state.  Unfortunately they tried  to come on all romantic, and are wisely kept down in the mix.  Far better  is Dominic Muldowney's largely unnoticed contribution as official composer  - his faux-fascist anthems have an unnerving, alluring power, maybe because  they're not a million miles away from any typical national anthem.
It was  shot in the London Docklands, the same location Kubrick used for the urban  bits of ""Full Metal Jacket"".  In those days they were derelict  and falling apart.  Now they're full of bright, clean offices and light  industry.  With which another bit of the England Orwell was nostalgic for  got bulldozed over.",965952000,2,1779,4.878787878787879
861246,4,6304362498,"Having just re-watched this for the first time since the '80s I have to say this is a far stronger more rounded film than I remember. I had re-read the book prior to my last viewing and the film, brilliantly realised as it  is, seemed like a 2 dimensional glossary in comparison (always the way I  suppose).
The story itself is product of it's age far more than any  attempt at crystal ball gazing. a dark extrapolation of all the worst fears  and trends of 1947 Britain. The film stays amazingly close to this vision  given the gulf of history that had passed between then and our  (non-Orwellian) 1984.
In 1947 The USSR had just tested their A-bomb.  Meanwhile in Britain food was still being rationed with no end to economic  deprivation in sight and we still had a conscript army to police the  dismantling of empire. The elation of the Wars end had started to subside  as the business of the day to day struggle to survive took over. The  prospect of our shattered, exhausted economy having to contend with another  major war against a Nuclear armed totalitarian state and the possible  aftermath are what fuelled George Orwells nightmare. But the bleak satire  is not entirely without dark humour. Check the recurrent theme of the first  30 minutes or so, of the gratitude of the populace as the joyous news is  announced of an increase in the chocolate ration from 30 grammes to 25  grammes per week.
One of Orwell's central themes in the book, which is  well expressed here, is the role of language as a shaper and facilitator of  conceptual thought. Restrict the language and you restrict the capacity to  think. Or so goes the Party's theory anyway. ""Its a beautiful thing,  the destruction of words"" Muses one of Winstons co-workers.
The  performances are subtle, graceful and powerful, as one would expect from  such a cast. Particularly worth mentioning are Cyril Cusack as the  grandfatherly Thought-Policeman. His screen time is around 6 minutes but  the effect is chilling. Also, Gregor Fisher. A gifted comic actor better  known to UK TV audiences as Rab. C.Nesbitt an unemployable Glaswegian  philosopher/drunkard. Here proving the range of his abilities as the jolly,  tragic Parsons. Richard Burton as O'Brian is consumate and masterly. The  man had gravitas. A rare thing.
The only real downpoint of the film as a  project is the dire musical contribution of the Eurythmics. These are  especially embarrassing presented as they are, beside the suberb  compositions of Dominic Muldowney for the film. One can only assume that it  was supposed at the time that the addition of what was then a big act to  the project would help with publicity & ticket sales. But as Prince  proved in 'Batman' and Queen proved with 'Flash Gordon', inspiration can't  be forced. In this case the Director has had sufficient sense to bury the  Eurythmics' contribution deep into the tapestry of the film where it barely  does any damage at all.
This is a powerful film and a fitting tribute to  the talents of Richard Burton. For that reason alone it does not deserve to  be forgotten the way it seems to have been. Re-release and a suitable DVD  treatment should now be a studio priority.",962323200,4,3189,4.777981651376146

861248,4,6304362498,"This film was really made as a tribute to George Orwell's novel, not to entertain movie goers. That's why it was filmed in the same year and months that the book was set. I think this film is really for people who have read  the novel. It tries to be faithful to George Orwell's description: dark,  dingy and grim. It succeeds in that respect, and follows the story as  closely as possible. Orwell used colour a lot when writing the  novel.
John Hurt is the third actor to play Winston Smith (after Peter  Cushing and Edmund O'Brien). He was suitably forlorn in the part. Richard  Burton and Suzanna Hamilton were equally fine in their roles.
Michael  Radford's film is superor to the 1956 version, which is unavailable. The  1956 version felt no guilt in distorting Orwell's story. There were minor  things like Julia being blonde, and major things like the ending: Winston  and Julia shouting ""Down with Big Brother!"" as they face  execution by the firing squad.
Michael Radford's version of the novel is  definitive, though flawed. As someone already said, it's hard to translate  words to the screen and satisfy everyone. Many great works of literature  have been unsuccessful as films. But they were made with the best of  intentions. I feel ""1984"" is reasonably successful.",944784000,19,1279,4.829493087557604
861249,3,6304362498,"'1984', being an English film, has clearly had trouble in translating to unsympathetic American viewers. Radford's adaptation of Orwell was so deliberately faithful that the end product should have been George Orwell  on screen. Not so. Naturally, to undertake such an opus is itself Herculean  so Radford deserves Kudos in that respect. There are plenty of treasures  here: Burton's performance as symbiotically represented with Hurt's and the  sheer attention to the most minute, nitty-gritty grotty detail being the  principal ones. The overall 'feel' of the film is as Orwell would have  intended: a wake up call to take a more direct approach in case anybody  missed the point in 'Animal Farm.'  And Orwell's point here hits home  thanks to Radford. The main trouble with the film is that it is too  depressing to stomach in some areas. It's sad to have to deduct a star for  that fact but it's true - '1984' is really not good entertainment at all.  Apart from a poignant soundtrack and the camera's worship of the colour  grey, there is really nothing left in this picture to enjoy when watching  at home. Very hard going in areas and the aesthetics of the set structure  are very quickly counteracted by the lurid hues of shifting monochromes and  immersion in small spaces. Basically what the viewer is left with is a  definite understanding of Orwell's anti-Communist standpoint as being  presented to match HIS idiosyncrasies, but there's really nothing to enjoy  or to come away from afterward. Still, a good job done on a compelling work  of literature (you might even be able to get away with watching it without  having read the book), only it's too intellectual to be anything more than  a Brecht mind-play - a self-absorbing representation of a dated phobia. I  bought it but I'd recommend only a rental for the plebs at large.",944611200,7,1844,4.877419354838709
861250,5,6304362498,"Though he compressed some very important material into a terse 2 hours, Radford brought the complex and thought provoking imagery of George Orwell's novel to life in this stunning and beautiful movie. John Hurt  brilliantly portrays Winston Smith in the bleak and hopeless atmosphere of  Big Brother's totalitarian, post WWII government whose sole ideal is the  irradication of individuality. The brainwashing and torture scenes between  Hurt and Richard Burton are superb.",939081600,5,473,5.619718309859155
861251,4,6304362498,"From the opening scenes of this film, I knew I was in for a treat!  Not many films leave knots in my stomach long after the credits roll like it did in '1984'.  Having previously read the book helped immensely  (especially towards the ending). However, the book was not able to portray  the horrific and unshakable images of a person being brutally tortured!  I  felt awful as I watched this human being suffer to that extreme(and it was  only a movie!).  I must say I didn't ""enjoy"" the movie, and would  most likely shudder at just the idea of watching it again.  Although I  geatly admire the film for making me feel that way, because the filmmakers  obviously made their point.  Wonderful job on the adaptation and directing.  Not to mention superb acting, cinematography, and musical score. Stanley  Kubrick's 'A Clockwork Orange' was the only other movie that left me with  these feelings and images left in my mind.  But after viewing '1984' only  once, I must say Kubrick's film doesn't hold a candle to Orwell's classic,  nightmatish Utopian society.  Do not be misled by the first half of the  film.  It takes a drastic and nasty turn in the second which is definetly  NOT for the squeamish.  Overall, the movie is a well-made and unforgettable  adaptation that reaches its important message.",937094400,9,1302,4.756756756756757
861252,5,6304362498,"The movie adaptation of 1984 does a masterful job of bringing to the screen the atmosphere of the totalitarian state. The dingyness, squallor, and overall state of opression are effectively conveyed to the audience.  The reduction of the vocabulary in order to create Newspeek was perphaps  the most sinister of the plots that were in play. To reduce the size of the  vocabulary is to reduce the complexity of thought, thus creating a  population of non-thinking individuals. I thought Burton and Hurt gave  equally good performances. Hurt, the very mild mannered functionary,  conveyed the constant state of fear that this society had put him in and  Burton, the party bureaucrat, gave an outstanding performance as an  individual who craved power who loved using it towards the misery of  others.",931305600,3,798,5.124031007751938

7869222,1,6304362498,"This is a dumb movie...

There are few movies as counter-intuitively wrong and inaccurate, or as self-confident as this one. The ideals of socialism are supposedly represented here, but in fact they are counterfeit and at root fascist. This movie seems impossibly unreal because it IS impossibly unreal in what it points to ""in horror"". Unrealistic and impossible, not because totalitarian states aren't bad (they are), but because totalitarian states NEVER embody socialism, they only embody a parody of socialism and the total control of fascism. I think that people just started saying Orwell was a genius in America and the UK one day back in the 80's of shoulder pads and fantasy hairspray dos and before you know it, everybody was saying it, but it was never true of this book and certainly not of the movie. This is bad filmmaking from a bad story written by a man who was off kilter and severely out of touch with the fascism that had long taken hold of his own country.

True totalitarianism is horrific enough in itself without dragging into it and vilifying all of the finer, if apparently difficult, bits of Buddhist philosophy, socialism and the modernist art that you can't fathom. If you want to see the REAL dangers of faux communism, watch The Blue Kite, which depicts a historical nightmare that does follow a realistic, predictable timeline and the story of which this story is a pale and flat rip-off, even with John Hurt's stoic use of the role. The momentary poetic fragments, such as the two naked lovers watching a peasant washer woman down below singing gently to herself, are unfortunately not indicative of the rest of the movie which attempts to startle us constantly and never manages to do so.

Orwell would have done better to rail against modernity itself, rather than to paint scenarios about post-war England that are simply not possible. Orwell was afraid of movements appealing to socialism, but he was too blinded by English fascism to see that he was furthering exactly that kind of agenda, but pitting an impossibly stark and totalitarian English-accented ""socialism"" against the beautifully pre-modern.",1526256000,,2142,4.96100278551532
7869223,5,6304362498,"Excellent adaptation of Orwell's dystopian masterpiece. The acting from Hurt and Burton alone is enough to warrant watching. Do NOT rent this if you like ""easy"" entertainment, however. This is a tough watch - and quite brutal by the end.",1526256000,,237,4.95
7869224,4,6304362498,"This is a good adaptation of Orwell's novel. Unfortunately, it doesn't delve nearly as deeply into the issues as the novel, but that's the nature of a two-hour movie, of course. Nevertheless, the story does suffer in places for its brevity. For example, when Julia passes a note to Winston saying that she loves him, it seems extremely abrupt. (It was somewhat abrupt in the novel, too, but there was much more background there.) And at the end of the movie, Winston mentions his wife, which comes completely out of the blue. (The novel made clear that he had been married.) Perhaps the biggest way the movie diverges from the book is the ending; in the movie, it is much more ambiguous (which I'm actually fine with). I was between 3 and 4 stars but decided what the heck, this movie was generally pretty well done.",1526083200,,816,4.595890410958904

It fits nicely into the thought process of those who like to believe in conspiracies, but not into that of those who face reality. Don't watch it if you are not prepared to deal with depression. But the acting is good. As for myself, I remain optimistic about our future. 1984 has come and gone, and the predicted things did not happen.",1525564800,,448,4.6835443037974684
7869226,5,6304362498,"Great movie!  I would suggest reading the book by George Orwell, as there are more details and elaborations, but the movie depicts the book very well.  I believe there are 3-4 film variations from different directors - all supposed to be good.
One can read the description for an adequate synopsis of this great film, but essentially, it's a ""utopia"" where the individual ceases to be nothing more than a cog in a wheel - all for the ""greater good"" of society, of country, of (political) Party.

Note:  Some of the terms in the movie aren't explained very well.  They are in the book.
I watched this via Amazon's streaming - not from the DVD or Blue-Ray.

I'd like to add an interesting fact:  George Orwell himself was a socialist, which I find contradictory to the premise and principle of the book/movie ""1984"".  This movie was aimed at Jospeh Stalin's U.S.S.R. and the single-Party corruption in Russia (and Stalin/Lenin's so-called corruption of socialism).  Despite this, many Marxists (socialists/communists/fascists/national socialists/etc.) attempt to portray Orwell's critique as that against capitalism, specifically ""state capitalism"", but this term is an oxymoron of itself.  How someone replaces or confuses the centrally planned and state controlled economy - found throughout ""1984"" - with capitalism is simply amazingly stupid.  Perhaps they didn't watch the movie or read the book??  Or perhaps, for them, 2 + 2 = 5 after all??  (Movie reference)
Regardless of George Orwell's own (misguided) political preference, he was the type of socialist that could see (and expose) fallacy where fallacy exists.
Mr. Orwell was an interesting person and great writer as his ""1984"" lives as proof!",1525478400,,1703,5.194139194139194

I think the lesson for our time, as some reviewers highlighted, is the danger of subtle forms of social pressure, such as social media. I'd rather see more nuanced movies than this one, which hits you over the head with an oversimplified message.
