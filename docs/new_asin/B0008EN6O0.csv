2258438,4,B0008EN6O0,"As P.D. James advanced through the series her novels became increasingly complex, and, thereby, increasingly removed from the general boundaries of the detective story genre. This is simply to say that Dostoevsky, Shakespeare, and many another wrote of crime and punishment, adultery and murder, and other matter of the genre, but they did so in a manner which removed it from the boundaries that were (or were to be) established for a modern detective story. I take this idea no more seriously than to warn readers or viewers who expect to read Philo Vance or Hercule Poirot, that increasingly they are getting a product from P.D. James that decreasingly looks like Philip Marlowe or Lord Peter and increasingly looks like a conventional novel. Another thing the reader should keep in mind is that the more complex the novel the less possible it is for a television adaptation to be more than a reasonable approximation at best.
That being said, I can commend this BBC production as an entertaining one in which the characters sometimes do structurally incomprehensible things and plot lines sometimes degenerate into dead ends but, still, what is there is a good show. The Inspector is more human than he has been shown to be  earlier in the series which is a pleasant change. The cast includes some fine  players who are sometimes forced by the writing to compress intricate thought and action into a wave of the hand and a few stray words. Nonetheless, quality shows and one settles for what one gets. If one has both the DVD and the film on hand, I should suggest, most tentatively, to see/read/hear (audio-book) first the one in the medium to which one is most attuned. There is something of a surprise ending which one would not want to prior to seeing the less favored media productions.",1291507200,,1795,4.824675324675325
2258439,2,B0008EN6O0,"So here's the deal: a priest friend of Dalgliesh invites him to visit him in his place near the Dorset coast.  The priest is connected to a stately home/rest/medical facility whose staff wear monk's robes, though they're not monks.  They may be murderers, arsonists, pornography readers, adulterers and drug dealers, but they're not monks.  Dalgliesh arrives to find his friend dead and soon other bodies begin to pile up.  Dalgliesh-on-holiday investigates, assessing the possible guilt of a relatively strong cast, including Pauline Collins and Art Malik.

Unfortunately, the resulting film/mini-series is quite disappointing.  I say this from the perspective of a viewer who has become accustomed to the quality of such shows as Morse, Inspector Lewis, Midsomer Murders, Frost, Pie in the Sky, The Last Detective and the incomparable Foyle's War.  The Black Tower is at least twice as long as it needs to be.  It is tediously talky; the acting is stilted and the production values poor.  In one scene we hear two of the characters talking.  They approach a house and the next shot is taken from the house's interior.  They are still outside, but since they are on the other side of the door and windows the volume of their voices is diminished and we can't hear them clearly.  In the final scene Dalgliesh runs to a phone to call the local constabulary, but the phone has been disconnected.  A few minutes later another character uses the phone and the cavalry arrive promptly.

Sound and continuity errors might be overlooked, but not when they affect major plot points.  Similarly, a certain amount of talkiness might be expected in an English mystery set in a hothouse environment with a collection of snarky characters, but much of the talk is dull and the acting which accompanies it is surprisingly amateurish.  Here, the actors sometimes perform as if they're on stage and need to indulge in exaggerated physical actions to hold the attention of the audience in the upper balcony, but film actors (as Michael Caine has taught us) act with their eyes (or should).  Here, there is additional awkwardness.  One of the characters has a bad leg and walks with a cane.  Sometimes he appears to be misshapen and in pain, sometimes he seems normal.

I don't want to spoil the story, but the crime turns on an action that involves a behavior that occurs only once a year and a criminal implement insufficient to accomplish anything beyond a relatively modest level of crime.  It is, in short, preposterous, particularly in light of the number of people who have been sacrificed to protect the criminal activity.

Rent this for a long evening's viewing when everything else is unavailable.",1257033600,4,2689,4.942093541202673
2258440,3,B0008EN6O0,"OK-P D James writes great stuff and Dalgliesh is a great ""COP"".Problem here is story
takes too long to unfold (Dalgliesh shows up midway through with no ""sidekick"".
) Local police are incompetent,except for a Sgt who we see a few times. So no
intelligent give and take that helps the viewer. Almost all characters seem extraneous,
and deaths could either be murder or suicide (and which doesn't matter much). The
villian stands out as unusual right away,and I can't see how his criminal activity
is on a large enough scale to support his lifestyle. A big plus is the exciting ending.
See my other reviews of P D James DVDs;there are some great plots elsewhere.",1252886400,2,660,4.698275862068965

She likes to throw in phrases to paragraphs in latin, Italian, French and so forth to confess her readers.

The stories seemed to get ever more gruesome after this one so I prefer to have the series before that.  P.D. James is, of course, masterful but I tend more toward Agatha Christie where things are less gruesome and less graphic.  And it is wonderful to see Art Malik!  I wish we saw him in far more things than we do after The Jewel in the Crown...",1391817600,,448,4.056818181818182
8055883,4,B0008EN6O0,Roy Marsden at his best and the PD James story is intriguing - a must for any PD James lover.  Production is a little dated but the story and acting hold up.,1361750400,,157,3.90625
8055884,4,B0008EN6O0,"This six part 287 minute presentation is my second introduction to P.D. James. Naturally I had to buy the book. Naturally the book is better. However that is not to distract from the film that took the time to really tell the story and keep you glued to the screen. I am continuing to discover a new favorite and intend to work my way through the balance of the films. I am watching in film order not book order.

Even with the length of time to present this story they had to cut corners. However in places it was like reading the book word for word. However the film neglects to mention that Chief Superintendent Adam Dalgliesh is wealthy in his own right.

The story is sort of convoluted. There are quite a few characters and they all look guilty. It appears that everyone had an opportunity to do it. Chief Superintendent Adam Dalgliesh (Roy Marsden) has a way of making everyone confess and looks right through you.

Inspector Adam Dalgliesh is recovering from a wound he got on duty. He is also depressed and thinking of giving up his job. A friend invites him to stay at a nursing home (Toyton Grange) and implies that there is some mysterious goings on. Soon people are dying from too many convenient accidents.

O.K. for those of you that read the book you may find the end a tad different and a page short. But close enough for T.V.

Some of the scenery East Anglia on the North Sea will rival the actors and story for your attention.",1346544000,2,1445,4.417293233082707

Terrific story, Roy Marsdon an excellent Daglish.
Fun to figure out the killer. Makes for great conversations with my husband",1334534400,,181,4.870967741935484
8055886,2,B0008EN6O0,"If you have trouble sleeping, this series is guaranteed to put you into a deep slumber--with no harmful side effects!  The soothing power of stiff British dialogue delivered by what must surely be wax figures (or possibly zombies?) is really quite unparalleled as a soporific.  When you add editing that makes an 8-year-old with a camcorder look like Steven Spielberg, even the most stressed-out Wall Street broker will doze off.

Highly recommended as a sedative. (Use only as directed.)",1299110400,,488,5.151898734177215
8055887,4,B0008EN6O0,"First of all I really love the theme music from this show; it is beautiful and very compelling to me! Secondly I really like Roy Marsden's portrayal of Adam Dalgliesh; he personifies the elegant, thoughtful, smart and clever British detective.

Having said that I must admit, however, that the show got off to a rather slow start; it seemed to pick up speed and get interesting when the Dalgliesh character appears in the story. The story is initially heavy on dialog and a little short on action. American audiences are not really accustomed to extended periods of talking, especially when it doesn't really seem to be advancing the story all that much.

Once Dalgliesh enters the story, then the excitement picks up and things start moving. The story maintains a good pace after that all the way to the end. I'll not mention any details, but the ending caught me by complete surprise. On reflection I would say this was an interesting mystery and worth the time it took to watch it.",1299110400,,984,4.715116279069767
8055888,5,B0008EN6O0,I like the acting and wish I had  the rest of the series.  Thanks Amazon for being it to my attention.,1296172800,,102,3.8095238095238093
