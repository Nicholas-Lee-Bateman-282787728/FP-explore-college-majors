8549961,4,B00ACAFZVM,"Oh I love it!.  The first few chapters were a bit slow (reason for 4 stars) so I had to fast forward a few spots.  But overall,  I thought Giant was a great drama. I was disappointed near the end but I will not give any spoilers. I have seen numerous dramas with Hwang Jung Eum and I always enjoy her acting skills.  Seem she have various layers of acting that is sure to please the audience.",1464652800,,392,4.0519480519480515
