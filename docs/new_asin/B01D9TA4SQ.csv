8755306,3,B01D9TA4SQ,"What a rip off. Only 2 out of 6 episodes are not on other Curious George DVDs.

The 6 episodes:

1. Curious George's Bunny Hunt
2. A Bridge Too Farm
3. Curious George Discovers the 'Poles
4. Color Me Monkey
5. Meet the New Neighbors
6. Curious George's Egg Hunt

Of the above episodes, 1 and 3 are both on the DVD Curious George - Zoo Night and Other Animal Stories, and 4 is on Curious George Leads the Band and Other Musical Mayhem! If you already own Season 7, 6 is on that DVD. If you own zero DVDs and buy or rent the Amazon video, you probably won't care about this review. But as we own several DVDs, it is annoying that there are literally less than half of ""new"" (old - 2 is from Season 2 and 5 is from Season 5) episodes on this DVD. Do yourself a favor and check it out at the library before you make a decision.",1468886400,15,823,3.9757575757575756
