8302236,3,B001FP3A2Y,"I bought this video because I wanted to get a better understanding of my DSLR camera.  The video was about an hour long and left a lot to be desired.  It taught me how to use the different buttons on the camera, but didn't go into much depth on anything.  I could have read the manual to get the exact same information that was in this video.  I was hoping for something more useful.",1322179200,,383,4.135135135135135
8302237,2,B001FP3A2Y,"I raced through this video in about 20 minutes, and I realized that there's nothing on this that you can't learn for free from either studying the manual or looking online.  This was a big waste of my money.",1293321600,,207,4.3076923076923075
8302238,3,B001FP3A2Y,"This DVD should be titled ""Introduction to Basic Photographic Techniques & Camera Operation, with Specific Reference to the Olympus E-520"".  As such, I would rate it 4 stars - & would probably not have purchased it!  Being an avid amateur photographer (& one who enjoys becoming familiar with a new camera via a thorough study of its operating manual), I found this DVD to be a complete waste of time & money.  Approximately half of the video is devoted to an explanation of basic camera operation & photographic techniques - the other half is simply a video presentation of much of what is contained in the supplied manual for the E-520.  If you're a beginning photographer (especially one who doesn't like to read instruction manuals), this video would definitely be a worthwhile purchase.  If you have a modicum of photographic experience & savvy, read the manual, save your money for a new lens, & spend your time making images!",1247270400,3,932,4.836477987421383
8302239,5,B001FP3A2Y,"Purchased this DVD to learn more about my camera and got so much more. Great presentation,Explains functions well and shows you the buttons he is pushing. Have your camera ready to follow along. Also shows different styles of shooting. I am new to digital photography. I thought it was easy to understand. Great menu setup easy to go back and review certain sections. I will be refering back to this DVD often to add some style to my photography. Thanks QuickPro!!!",1234051200,2,465,4.753086419753086
