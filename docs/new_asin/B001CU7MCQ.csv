8289276,5,B001CU7MCQ,"i have served in the navy and i have seen what goes on and can relate to your ship sinking from under you. the Navy can also be retarted and shoot it's on foot however by blaming one of their capable captains for being a victim of the war. it is not acceptable that the Indianapolis was ignored for a week and 1100 men were ripped apart by sharks, the sea, the sun, and each other. Captain McVay was held accountable for it and finally took his own life  in 1968....the war did not end until then for him. i hope he is at peace...Corey",1449014400,2,535,4.095238095238095
