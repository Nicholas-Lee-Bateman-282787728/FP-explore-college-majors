8490709,1,B000SL0CMC,"I received this as a gift, although one that I requested.  The sole reason I wanted it was for some footage and information on the Martin B-26 Marauder.  I should have realized something was amiss, since the description on-line and on the box itself lists the Martin R-26 Marauder.  Thinking it was a typo, I watched the DVD.  It was a so-so documentary, but no mention of the B-26 (or R-26, for that matter).  I scanned through it again, just to make sure.  Nope, nothing about the B-26.  This is the plane that my father was shot down in, so I was a little more than disappointed.  It seems to be a British production,  from a BBC series maybe.

As for the DVD itself, it seems to have been thrown together.  There is no menu at all.  It starts playing as soon as you pop it in.  The chapter stops are random, so you can't skip to a specific plane.

Anyway, if you're into WWII and/or bombers, you should probably look elsewhere.  I'm sure there's better quality out there somewhere.",1203552000,3,985,4.394444444444445
