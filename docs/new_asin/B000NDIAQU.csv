8177273,5,B000NDIAQU,Will Smith's biography was informative.  Everything or nearly everything I wanted to know about him was revealed in this DVD.  The price was just right also.,1324339200,2,157,5.0
8177274,4,B000NDIAQU,"I enjoyed this biography about Will, except for the fact that none of his family was interviewed.  I would of liked to hear some personal facts about his childhood from his folks and siblings, otherwise it was very entertaining",1279152000,3,227,4.82051282051282
8177275,5,B000NDIAQU,"This is a very good Bio on Will Smith.  While I thought I knew quite a bit about him as I've followed his entire career it was nice to hear how he was brought up and what others thought of him at an early age.  I'm a teacher and I'm using this for my marketing class but ALSO for my Personal Finance class ~ I loved how his ""early"" IRS issue more or less changed his career path!  Amazing!  It is very refreshing to hear how values do matter to the rich and famous!",1266537600,4,465,3.9148936170212765
