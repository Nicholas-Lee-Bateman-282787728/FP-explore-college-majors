5569856,5,B00BBCIPFI,This movie is spellbinding - we were on the edge of our seats for the entire time.  Every movie buff should have a copy for their movie library!!  I will be purchasing another copy for my friend's birthday.  Absolutely loved it!,1371859200,,228,4.512195121951219
5569857,4,B00BBCIPFI,"not a kids movie for sure lol. Alot of good parts the end was thrilling, i think there were some slo mo parts, reminds me of old spaghetti western which totally needs a comeback. The surealism if u will, the slow parts of the spagehtti ones totally lacking in modern stuff. definitley have that down or started It going. If your going to have a slow reprieve they usual pick it up with some heart pounding stuff. Great with visuals, and will love to see more in future, the whole ambiance thing is totally going. If your into off the beaten path movies with thought provoking dialogue, this one shows potential, look forward to seeing the sequals to this directors movies being his first feature film. I liked it.",1368403200,2,713,4.534883720930233
5569858,4,B00BBCIPFI,Found this at Blockbuster because my boyfriend wanted to see it.  It was his turn so this is what we got.  I actually kind of enjoyed it and never leave reviews so I guess that means something. Pleasantly surprised.  4 out of 5sies.,1368316800,2,232,4.348837209302325
5569859,2,B00BBCIPFI,"Jack (Robert Seay) is an ex-Iraqi war vet, which we know from the movies all become hired killers. His latest request to murder a porn producer (Jeffrey Vincent Parise) who disfigured an eastern European woman brought to America to make adult film. There is a subplot which involves his ex-GF and former sister-in-law (same person, Kodi Kitchen) who shows up at his door one day needing a place to crash. Meanwhile there is a guy named Brill (Mark Rolston) who wants to recruit Jack.

The action scenes are quick which allows the film to move slow. Jack doesn't really have any character and its stone faced the entire film. The subplots don't come together in a clever fashion as one would expect which leaves you wondering, ""what's the point?"" There are better indie action films out there. Poorly conceived and poorly executed.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex talk, off screen sex, nude painting on wall.",1367625600,12,904,4.863636363636363
5569860,5,B00BBCIPFI,Interesting story line that moves this film along in fantastic fashion. Stealthy performance turned in by the main character Verlaine among others in this film. Well worth the purchase and would look fantastic in blu-ray!,1366588800,5,221,5.3428571428571425
5569861,1,B00BBCIPFI,Poor acting.  Stupid. Glad I didn't pay to see it,1457481600,,49,3.9
5569862,3,B00BBCIPFI,"Jeffrey Vincent Parise. He is the only reason I even watched this movie or stuck with it until the end. This man is a brilliant actor and, as always, his performance doesn't disappoint.  Tom Sizemore also did a fine job, but Robert Seays performance leaves a lot to be desired. If the writer intended for the character of Jack Verlaine to be a one-dimensional, emotionless robot-like-human, then Seays performance is dead on. I didn't like the character at all nor did I care about what happened to him. I was very torn about how to rate this movie. The storyline itself isn't bad, but sadly, it falls short of being a great film. I do, however, believe that excellent work should be praised. Jeffrey Vincent Parise is deserving of such praise for his performance. In my opinion, hes truly the only good thing about this film. If I could give five stars to just his performance-thats what Id do. Since I cant- I give the movie 3 stars overall.",1457308800,,943,4.579881656804734

I used to wonder how people got listed on IMDB and this movie affirms where investor money can go- right down the tubes- oh well, it keeps SAG members' dues flowing and Amazon can show a stable-full of movies ( which aren't yet notorious) this one went on and on and on, leaving me depressed and otherwise bored, stupefied.having watched a bunch of Amazon Prime movies back to back, I found myself wondering if this might qualify as a stimulus for a diagnosis of clinical depression- too many of these in a binge of weekend boredom and an erstwhile escape from FaceBook and laundry duties, it's a bit too much-",1454198400,,680,4.536585365853658

5569886,1,B00BBCIPFI,"This loser, Robert Seay, portraying a hitman and ex military iraq vet has be one of the hardest thing any stupid producer/director has EVER asked his audience to swallow.... this lamea$$ doode looks and acts so lame that it's almost impossible to like the movie the second you see him, like 5 minutes into the movie. He looks like a traveling salesman selling vacuum cleaners and has the carriage of one as well...droopy shouldered and just all around droopy looking... He made his suit look like some cheap off the rack crap because of the way he fits it... lol I'm sorry about ragging on this fool so much but seriously...come one...whoever did the casting should be taken out to the back and shot and then mutilated by raccoons. I wanted to turn it off the moment I saw him walking around and even speaking but my OCD got the better of me and forced me to watch this to it's bitter ending... stupid OCD...next time just let me shoot myself in the head and avoid all this masochism... but yeah...please sign my petition to never let Robert Seay play ANY ROLE LIKE THIS...EVER AGAIN.... he should be playing some nerd romance Love, Actually kind of movie where he can be a loser and still fit the part...ugh...anyways in case you're dense and couldn't figure it out...STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE!

After the first ten minutes, I continued to watch it as a pure exercise in masochism. The main character is not just written or directed to be abhorrently vapid and non-dimensional, he must be one off-screen. No plot, no action, no sense. If this guy Lintz had ever been to a dance club, he would have picked some music. Fifteen minutes is spent on a monologue by a sadistic pedophile, talk about his first sexual experience, which seems like Nicky Boy's sick wet dream.

5569929,2,B00BBCIPFI,"So, this is a fine example of how every trick in the filmmaker's bag does not a good movie make.  Big name, check.  Pretty actors, check.  Good cinematography, check.  Sex and violence, check.  Good movie?  Not even close.

Even with all the right ingredients this film is just a mess, there is zero compelling storyline and the glacial pacing does very little to hide the obvious lack of content.  Every good movie has an interesting story at it's core and this is completely absent. You don't care about a single character in this flick, Tom Sizemore is just cashing a paycheck here.  The lead is totally wooden, I'm sure he's supposed to be a cold blooded killer, but he just comes across as a having all the personality of a walking napkin.  The porn guy is mildly interesting but they spent way too much time on his ""vision of art"" and that monologue is so overwrought.

The movie would have been much better with at least 30 min cut out.  The soundtrack is nice though and is very complementary to the mood of the film. I did enjoy noticing at the end, Verlaine's good trigger discipline.  Nice Sig Sauer too, definitely a professional choice.

All in all, it just feels like all the energy is spent trying gloss over a very weak story.  And the writer obviously had no idea how to end it and just ripped off some Magnum PI episode.",1416268800,,1338,4.471074380165289
