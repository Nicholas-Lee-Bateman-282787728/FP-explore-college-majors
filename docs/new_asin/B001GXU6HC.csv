This is an absolutely fantastic film about a journey not only to a far place but also a very intimate view to a personal journey within.

This film comes excruciatingly close to the center, in fact I think they pretty much got there.",1276732800,2,306,4.464285714285714

I am a hiker, rafter, climber in the forests here in WV and I had seen this video a few weeks before when the BANFF Mountain Film Festival came to town and as I watched this with other outdoor extremists, we all shared the suspense, fear and energy!

There are many different angles, shots and views that make you feel as though -- and you are there, sharing the views as they see them falling from buildings, cliffs and caves around the world.  I cannot say for myself I could ever do it, even with the training but feeling as they do in a high-altitude fall cannot be reproduced...great DVD

8307418,5,B001GXU6HC,"I just attended the 2009 Banff Mountain Film Festival World Tour held in Baltimore. Journey to the Core is, by far, my favorite selection! I usually find sport related documentaries to be boring, but this film was so well made I will never forget it for the rest of my life!

Journey to the Center is powerful and deeply moving! The base jumpers' humanity shines through! I also felt like I was literally there with these three amazing and inspiring men!  And, the cinematography is just spectacular!

I hope this film gets an Academy Award for Best Documentary! This is film making at its very best!
