1957285,5,B0000VV4OK,"I just got through watching Pieces of April, and I must say ""WOW"". This picture is the best movie I have seen in a long time. The message sent in the picture is sent in an emotionally charged way, and Katie Holmes shines as April.
Katie Holmes stars in this short independent film as April Burns, a confident 21 year old out in the world at large. But like most 21 year olds who show an exterior of rock, she is crumbling on the inside. She is estranged from her family, and the distance is finally beginning to get to her. She invites her family over for Thanksgiving dinner at her stylish East End Apartment. She just has one slight problem, her stove is broke. So the brunt of the movie is her going around the apartment complex looking for a stove. Along the way with each stranger she encounters you get more and more incite into her character's inner turmoil.
April is secretly looking forward to mending the fences with her family, but is nervous and not to hopeful about them even showing up. You can really see the emotion when April goes down to see her parents have left, and her heart is broken, but in end she gets her wish, and the family is reconciled for the time they have left together.
Oliver Platt is superb as April's Father, the only one who has been in constant contact with her.
Patricia Clarkson does indeed shine as April's condescending, cancer ridden mother, who is equally wanting to reconcile with her daughter, but is also unwilling to under go another disaster.",1077580800,2,1493,4.492647058823529
1957286,4,B0000VV4OK,"I really love that fact that it's becoming less and less pretentious to like the 'little' movies out there. As the 2004 Oscar nominations prove, it's more than being 'artsy' for the sake of it when it comes to small-scale, independent films - there is really something special about these movies that is finally being recognized by the masses. This past year, American Splendor, Lost in Translation, and The Station Agent all wooed audiences with their fresh, creative writing and awe-inspiring performances, and although I'm not ready to put writer/director Peter Hedges' touching, charming Pieces of April with the rest of those, I can't deny that the brief 81 minutes spent in the company of Katie Holmes, Patricia Clarkson, Oliver Platt, and a small host of supporting characters aren't a joy.
It's a rather simple, farcical kind of premise - wild-child that's left the nest, April (Holmes), has taken on the responsibility for preparing Thanksgiving dinner inside her tiny, dirty New York apartment...but of course, everything possible goes wrong in the process. Along the way, we meet various neighbors inside of her building as she scrambles to fend off disaster, while also seeing her family (dad; alzheimer's grandma; brother; annoying younger sister; and mom, Joy (Clarkson), who is slowly dying of cancer) as they make their way across the state for that inevitable, uncomfortable moment.
  It sounds rather dumbed-down and bare, and it is really nothing more than that. This intimate film, wisely filmed on DV, relies on engrossing, often-hilarious performances from its leads that allow the simplicity of the plot to not only become a forgivable sin but a way to the means of seeing Holmes, and especially Clarkson, shine. Yes, April is sans oven, but that gives her the opportunity to go parading around the building finding a soul generous enough to let her use theirs. Lillias White and Isaiah Whitlock, Jr. are charming as a middle-aged black couple that helps April take care of part of her problem, but then the movie makes its big boo-boo with the introduction of Sean Hayes as Wayne, an eccentric neighbor upstairs with a dog named Bernadette. The movie does make a few tiny missteps here and there, but I really did not enjoy the fact that Hayes is obviously feeding off his popularity on Will and Grace. Thankfully, he is simply a marginal character and disappears nearly as quickly as he comes on the scene.
  April has that 'bad mother-daughter relationship that must be resolved eventually' plot device to it, but it really becomes the greatest aspect of Pieces of April in the end. This is mainly due to Patricia Clarkson's sly-but-complicated role as the dying mother. In many movies, this would be a way to get unneeded sympathy from the audience, but the way that Clarkson delivers really takes out that necessity. April's mother is a resentful, bitter woman plagued by a not-so-pleasant past with her daughter, and April pretty much feels the same way. There's no way to sympathize with either side - we can see where both mother and daughter went wrong in the past, and most scarily of all: you'll identify with the situation. Even in separate locations for nearly the entire film, Holmes and Clarkson make that connection so real.
  Pieces of April is one of those films that grows on you as you watch it. Yes, some of the humor is a little stagey and you know where the ending will take you (even after a fake-out), but by the final stretch of the film, I found myself realizing what a pleasure it all is. April has an off-putting charm that morphs into a heartwarming-but-simplified finale that oversteps its cheesiness and becomes real emotion, and that will be somewhat how you might feel about the film. It's a little basic, a little facile, but it's short, harmless, and able to move you to tears. Sounds like a good movie to me. Grade: B",1075507200,6,3877,4.8755690440060695
1957287,4,B0000VV4OK,"This is a realy short film but it packs so much in and was one of the best i saw last year.  I wasn't to impressed by the first 30 minutes as others have said then it realy got going.  What i loved about the film was that it reflected the fact that help often comes from where you least expect it and those that are in the best position to help dont.....you will see.  The final sequence is wonderfull, unexpected and immensely powerfull, i cried my eyes out and couldn't leave the cinema everyone had gone!  Stephin Merritt's tunes are the icing on the cake, some of it composed especialy...enjoy",1074729600,,597,4.351351351351352
1957288,4,B0000VV4OK,"Shooting for observational humor and pain on a shoestring budget, Oscar-nominated writer (""Gilbert Grape"",""About a Boy"") and first-time director Peter Hedges almost misses as much as he hits. That said, ""Pieces of April"" is definitely worth 81 minutes of your time.
Consider yourself warned: This baby pulls no punches. Whether it's cancer, family cruelty, life in New York City slums, or even roadside restrooms, Hedges keeps things stark. This ain't your mother's Lifetime Network Thanksgiving movie. But if you've ever had terminal illness touch the holidays, felt rejected by the ones you feel should love you most, or put up with the last straw from a self-destructive relative, you'll find truth, commiseration, and knowing laughter here.
Hedges wrote this while grieving his mother's death at the hands of cancer. The immediacy and indignity of the illness are vivid and are handled with honesty and skill. Keeping April's mother sympathetic without losing her cynicism and insensitivity requires deft acting chops, and Patricia Clarkson not only rises to the challenge but owns it.
The atmospheric and semi-documentary style of the movie is often spoiled by forced jokes and contrived situations that remind you you're watching a movie. This feeling is further aggravated by all the name actors in the cast. It's hard to see Holmes, Platt, Clarkson, Luke, and Hayes in this $200K film without thinking, ""Boy, did they take a pay cut to do this one."" Holmes' angelic face peeking out from under the Goth make-up and Hayes' overly-mannered ""I'm Not Just Jack"" performance have a similar effect. This requires taking suspension of disbelief to a third level. But it's doable.
Some will find it pretentious, others inspiring. Just like the holidays!",1072051200,11,1753,5.241992882562277

We need to realize we are all unique human beings and we need to just cherish and love each other exactly how we are even when they if they are not what we wanted them, imagined or expected them to be.

Pros: Katie Holmes is such eye-candy, Patricia Clarkson is so good it's hateable

Cons: Shaky camera, only good for one viewing.

This DVD was a birthday present to me, because of my infamous fondness of Katie Holmes. It was a cheap birthday gift, but still I suppose it's the thought that counts.

The Story

 Well, the story is very simple really. It is set mainly in a small apartment on the lower east side in Manhattan. It is Thanksgiving morning, and April Burns (Katie Holmes -Go, Dawson's Creek) has invited her family over to her small apartment in this bad neighborhood for a Thanksgiving dinner. April's relationship with her family has been strained since she could remember, especially with her mother, Joy (Patricia Clarkson - The Green Mile, Jumanji).

 One of April's earliest memories is re-remembered when her live-in boyfriend Bobby (Dereck Luke - Awtone Fisher) shows her Thanksgiving turkey salt and pepper shakers. These happen to be the exact same style she remembers from her past, and when she was playing with them as a child, her mother told her, ""Be careful with those, they're worth more than you"".
 Bobby informs April that they cost him 50?.

 Meanwhile at the Burns house in Pennsylvania, the family is getting ready pretty early as they have a long drive ahead. Joy's husband, Jim (Oliver Platt - Bicentennial Man, Simon Birch) and the kids are getting ready as well, but worrying that Joy may be dead. She has breast cancer, she had surgery, chemo and whatever else, and this hasn't really made her any nicer.
 She makes some off the cuff remarks to her husband and two other children that are just plain mean and thoughtless.
 And this is going to be a long a stressful ride to Manhattan, if she gets her way.

 April has run into some problems back in her apartment. The biggest is that her oven will not light. My guess is it's the igniter switch. She goes from apartment to apartment knocking on doors and asking if she could use the oven. She ultimately uses three, and not without comical results.

 April and Bobby went to great lengths to make sure that this first impression would be a great one. This will be Bobby's introduction to the family, and April needs to reconcile with her mother before she dies. What happens along the way, may make you laugh a couple of times, but more often than not will frustrate you beyond belief.

My Thoughts

 It seems to me that April's brother and sister get along with their mother Joy rather than April because of two reasons. One, April is older and lived with this hate filled woman longer than her siblings have. She has known her way before her useless bout with cancer, and has grown to the point that she just cannot live under the same roof as her mother.

 Joy has gotten into her share of trouble during the years she lived home with her family. They are mentioned only in passing, but they include fire, drug use and rebellion.

 Patricia Clarkson must have done a fabulous job here portraying Joy Burns because I actually feel hate for her. The little evil nuances she displays throughout the movie force my two hands to form choke hold Cs, which I would gladly place around her neck. From her little hurtful remarks to her husband and children, she disappears constantly and hides from them, she even pretends to be dead in one scene. As a former cancer patient myself, I was very offended at her exploitation of this horrible disease.

 All of the characters were very believable and were easy to have enough comprehension despite the shortness of the movie and the span of only one day. Katie Holmes, is wonderful as always in my opinion, but I love her so much that my opinion may be slightly biased. She looks great, and as I watched her in this film, her frustrations were my frustrations.

 This was directed by Peter Hedges. This was the first movie he has directed, but he is responsible for great screenplays such as About A Boy and What's Eating Gilbert Grape. One of the dizzyingly annoying things in this movie was the unsteadiness of the camera in very scene. Peter Hedges does a pretty decent job with this movie, yet the replay factor is hardly registering. I've seen this movie one Friday night, I don't think I ever need to watch it again.",1499212800,,4269,4.625994694960212

1957307,2,B0000VV4OK,"This movie came highly recommended by a friend. However, we thought it was a dumb movie. April was really stupid. Examples: trying to mash raw potatoes:, putting whole celery sticks and a whole uncut onion in the turkey; and didn't just ask neighbors ""Can I use your oven. Mine is broken and I have family coming for Thanksgiving."" Instead she rambled on without getting to the point.

It does all this with compassion, humor and insight. I've seen it on TV multiple times, but know I missed some of it. That is why I wanted to buy it. I'll be watching it soon.

1957322,2,B0000VV4OK,"If you are a woman, and you had a painful relationship with your mother because she never seemed to accept you for who you are, leading you to act out, rebel, etc., or just to quietly simmer and wonder if she would ever give you the love you wanted and deserved, you may like this movie.  I did not like it because the characters were two-dimensional--never developed, never believable--and the filmmaker unfortunately chose a glib, sarcastic yet campy humor tone with which he approached this subject (painfully strained relationships reexamined in the face of approaching death). It's a potent premise, but this movie squanders it. Annoying and a waste, especially given the talent of the cast. The script really stank. I highly recommend a different movie about this same general topic (although the adult son in the movie does not have a strained relationship with his dying mother, but rather with his father): Other People. I give that one about 4 1/2 stars, but this one tops out at 2. It does have some very poignant, moving moments (I counted two), but they don't make the rest of the movie worth watching.",1482019200,,1115,4.807291666666667

I often see this type of thing in real life. Selfish people that are crappy parents but later take no responsibility for how badly the children turn out. If you know you've messed up that bad, cut them some slack.

Sometimes there is no time in life to do things over. This is a sad but beautiful story of things turning out well because this family decided life was too short to not try one more time. Add it to your list. I bet you will watch it more than once in your lifetime. It became very important to me as I ran out of time with my family. As I don't give away plots, I just highly recommend you watch it with an open heart. You will laugh and cry. I do every time I see this film. Thanks, Amazon, for having it available.

In my top five films of all time which is simply films that really speak to me.  Nothing fancy here.  Just great acting and a wonderful life-affirming story.",1417219200,,365,4.484848484848484
1957390,5,B0000VV4OK,"This is not necessarily a movie for everyone.  Let me explain the premise....April lives in a small NY apartment and is the black sheep of the family.  She and her boyfriend are hosting Thanksgiving for the first time and what might be her mom's last Thanksgiving as she has cancer.  I know, sounds like a downer and not a comedy, right?  Well, depends on your perspective.  When this came out we had started to deal with my mom's cancer and mom watched it with me and we could definitely relate to the mom's wicked sense of humor and not wanting to be handled like a breakable object.  She even stops the car at one point to advise the family that they will all have to come to grips with how they will deal with....(see everyone's grief stricken faces).....April's lack of cooking skills and how they will hide and get rid of the food.....

Meanwhile back at April's apartment her boyfriend, Bobby has gone out to do some errands and she finds that she does not have a working oven so she roams the hallways with her turkey trying to find someone that will let her cook the turkey in their oven.  She obviously knows no one in the building, so it is hilarious as she goes from the family that can't speak English, a Vegan that says she wants to speak with her alone)....so April leaves the turkey on the floor in it's pan.... and the African American couple who open their home for a brief time and school her in the evils of canned cranberry sauce.

I disagree that there isn't humor, the movie has many funny moments but some humor is a little on the dark side.  It is about trying to reconcile, living in the moment and dealing with the cards that life deals you.  After mom and I first watched this it became our quirky tradition to watch around Thanksgiving most years.  I still love it!

Overall, not for everyone, but definitely had great acting, lots of humor and a heartfelt story line, but if you are looking for a laugh a minute and light hearted fun, this would definitely not be for you.",1417046400,,2002,4.407608695652174

We then loaned the movie to my granddaughter (who has a 5 year old son) and her boyfriend - and they both thought it was a good movie and enjoyed it also.

This cropped up on some respectable lists based as much on the ensemble cast as the star.
I got what I expected and I really didn't expect much.
I just hoped for more from this classic dysfunctional holiday family film.
This is not something I'd watch again let alone over and over.
I was hoping for an Indie treasure with some redeeming Coen brothers or Woody Allen quality.
Maybe a Sixteen Candles in hiding.
The opening has you believing this young woman is Angelina Jolie in Girl, Interrupted.
That character was far more than the funky hair and ripped stockings on Katie Holmes.
I was curious to see if Katie Holmes could pull it off and if she could carry a film.

This is why we love independent films about real families, their problems, and how they overcome them.  It is about love, about reaching out, about creating a new, extended , family beyond our parents and siblings.

I can't blame her - it's THAT good. Katie Holmes is adorable as the bad-kid-gone good trying to make a thanksgiving dinner for her estranged family. The story splits between Katie's character and all the things going wrong while she tries to make the perfect meal and her family driving to her home and their doubts about what they are getting themselves into. They only remember the bad girl who drove them all to distraction as she was growing up. But she has become a wonderful individual who has cleaned up her life and is trying to show them so with this meal. This movie is both moving and funny, sad and uplifting.

1957521,5,B0000VV4OK,"I tell you one thing; a movie about a girl baking a turkey does not sound like it's going to be interesting or even remotely entertaining.  In fact, to be completely honest the only reason I was interested in seeing `Pieces of April' was because I had a huge crush on Katie Holmes for a while (that was before she went cuckoo for Cruise puffs) and it really wasn't until Patricia Clarkson got the Oscar nomination for her performance in the film that I made my mind up to actually see it.  I'm so glad that I did, for `Pieces of April' is not only entertaining and interesting, but it is such an emotionally connected piece.  It was something that proved to be so much more than I expected it to be.

I'm stunned, literally stunned, at the finished product.

Katie Holmes plays April Burns, the wayward daughter of Jim and Joy Burns.  Having straightened her life out to the best of her ability, April decides that she needs to reconnect with her family, which includes her brother Timmy and her sister Beth.  The task of having her family over for Thanksgiving dinner though, proves to be a little more than April bargained for.  There to hold her together is her supportive boyfriend Bobby.  Add to the strain of seeing her disapproving and judgmental family the fact that her mother Joy is dying of cancer and you have a very stressful and nerve-racking day.  The film follows April as she prepares for her family's arrival as well as follows her family as they travel to see her.

What I appreciate so much about this film is, having been in a very similar situation with my own `wayward' sister, it fleshes out quite accurately the different ways in which family members deal with the situation.  You have the father who so badly wants to see the good in April, his eldest daughter and obvious heartbeat.  You have the mother who is so tired of the drama and the disappointment that she'd rather not have to deal with her at all.  This doesn't mean she doesn't love her daughter or have affection for her.  Rather, it's the type of love that burns so much within a person that you would rather avoid the ones you love than see them in yet another degrading situation.  You also have the sister who resents April for what she has done to the family.  She comes off as cruel and rude but on the inside she is just hurt.  Last you have the brother who doesn't exactly know how to deal with the issues.  He loves his sister and may or may not even truly understand why everyone is so up in arms over her life.  All he sees is that fact that she is his sister, his flesh and blood, and that's all that matters to him.

The performances within the film are glorious, and I mean that in everyway possible.  Patricia Clarkson is phenomenal as Joy, truly heartbreaking and real.  Oliver Platt serves up one of his finest performances to date as Jim; you can really feel his pain, his turmoil.  John Gallagher Jr. and Alison Pill depict April's siblings with honesty and realism and Derek Luke is wonderful, if not a tad underused, as Bobby.  I just love where this kid is headed.  Everything he's done so far has been top notch, even when the film isn't.  Alice Drummond is memorable as Grandma Dottie and Sean Hayes has a very strange yet memorable role in the film as well.  All of these performances just further accentuate the marvelous Katie Holmes.  This performance proves that she has talent behind those good looks.  She captivates as April, really getting under her skin and making her real to us.  I felt her every emotion, and when she breaks down towards the end, feeling as though her family has abandoned her my eyes actually began to tear (it really doesn't take much; I'm a tad emotional).

In the end I must admit to being in love with this movie.  It feels so real to me, like a chapter out of my childhood.  I've been here before and I've seen these very same emotions on full display and I'm beside myself with admiration for the fact that written/director Peter Hedges got it right.",1207094400,8,4000,4.471724137931035

1957540,5,B0000VV4OK,"Although plenty of directors morph family dysfunction into humour, this movie is hardly a comedy, but more of a voyeristic and amusing drop-in on someone's Thanksgiving meal.  Pretty Katie Holmes is believable as the angry, rebel daughter who, on the most stressed out of all holidays, decides to reach out across the cavernous divide of familial relations gone astray for that big one: approval from the family.

The claustrophobic, gritty and low-budget filming during a gray November is the key for the viewer to make the leap of faith past the comedic possibilities and upscale cast and submit to a sense of bleakness tinged with only a shred of hope. In fact, had the movie been expensive and slick, it might have had an oil and water combo of comedy and drama that equals another ho hum Hollywood soon to be forgetten flick. Not so here.

The characters are interesting and faulted in their own right, but for all their downfalls it's possible to have a sense of forgiveness for them. Patricia Clarkson does a beautiful job as the ascerbic, dying mother battling chemotherapy nausea and resignation in between glazed donuts. Although the movie does not succumb to sentimentality, better get out the tissues for the ending.",1181001600,2,1228,4.9227053140096615
1957541,4,B0000VV4OK,"The transition from teen TV actress to movie star is fraught with difficulties. Katie Holmes, longtime lead actress for the WB's ""Dawson's Creek,"" is the latest to attempt the move. Her early efforts showed a knack for picking quality material (""Wonder Boys,"" ""Go""), although most of these films featured her in supporting roles.

With the ultra-low-budget ""Pieces of April,"" that changed. Holmes plays April, a problem child who rarely sees her parents (played by Patricia Clarkson and Oliver Platt) or younger siblings. Now, she's trying to clean up her act, dumping her drug-dealing boyfriend for the more upstanding Bobby (Derek Luke) and inviting her family to her NYC apartment for Thanksgiving dinner.

Despite April's recent efforts to clean her act up, her family remains skeptical and less than eager to make the trek to April's abode. But, perhaps buoyed by the terminal illness of one family member, they reluctantly make the trip. The film primarily alternates back and forth between the family's rather eventful road trip and April's equally eventful attempt to cook Thanksgiving dinner. April's trials and travails include a frantic search for a working oven to cook the turkey in, a search that eventually leading her to an eccentric neighbor's home (played by ""Will & Grace"" star Sean Hayes).

""Pieces of April"" veers wildly between offbeat humor and poignant drama. It's an uneasy mix, largely because some of the bizarre scenarios seem forced. Worse yet, some of the comedic scenes are downright unfunny. Still, writer Peter Hedges (""What's Eating Gilbert Grape,"" ""About A Boy""), making his directorial debut, compensates with some genuinely funny and touching moments. The film's gritty low-budget look also works to its advantage, adding a feeling of realism to the proceedings.

The cast, working for virtually no pay, is solid all around. It's a kick to see Holmes in a gritty low-budget indie shot on video. She accepts the challenge and thrives, giving her best film performance to date. Clarkson, who won a special jury prize at Sundance for her role, shines as April's mother, alternating between bitter rage and love for her family. Luke, who burst onto the scene in Denzel Washington's ""Antwone Fisher,"" continues to show that he's an acting natural. Finally, how can you not like a film that finds an amusing part for Sisqo (of ""Thong Song"" fame)?

""Pieces of April"" was truly a lavor of love for Hedges. Shot for only $150,000 and partly inspired by his mother's battle with cancer, it was a hit at Sundance. An often funny, poignant story about family dysfunction, it's packed with a sense of intimacy missing from most of the hollow big-budget behemoths crowding the theaters.

1957544,5,B0000VV4OK,"I get so tired of walking through grocery store check-out lines and seeing tabloids ""reporting"" on the private lives of ""celebrities"" that I sometimes forget that SOME of the celebrities (unlike, for example, Paris Hilton) actually have talents and abilities that are worth note.  Katie Holmes, in a life aside from the paparazzi maelstrom that surrounds her now, is quite a good actress, and she gives us one of her best performances as the titular April in Peter Hedges' ""Pieces of April"".  Hedges was unknown to me, but I later found out that he also wrote ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"" so he has at least a little idea of the movie biz.  Pieces of April was made for a pittance and the budget shows up in the way the film seems to have been filmed entirely with a hand-held camera with whatever light was available.  But in the brief 80 minute running time a little magic happens.  Most in the cast took a considerable pay cut to bring this delightful script to life.  Sean Hayes plays a minor role as April's effete upstairs neighbor, and the movie could have been made three times over for his salary on a single episode of ""Will and Grace"".

April is the black sheep in the Burns family - the daughter that ""went Goth"", dyed her hair and moved to a dingy New York apartment with her drug dealer boyfriend.  The bad boyfriend has been ditched, though, and Derek Luke is great as Bobby, April's new boyfriend.  As the film opens we see that Bobby has urged April to reach out to her family, especially her mom, who is dying of breast cancer.  Bobby and April have invited the rest of the Burns family to join them for Thanksgiving.

Patricia Clarkson gives a superlative performance as that mother, Joy Burns.  Joy doesn't have that much time left, and she is resistant to losing even more precious time in a drive to and from April's apartment.  She is certain, given past experiences with April, that the whole experience is going to be a disaster.

Alison Pill is next oldest daughter, Beth.  She is even more resentful about the trip.  While April has made a mess of her life and relationships, Beth has been the ""good girl"", and she also resents the fact that the family is giving time and attention to April and her dysfunctional life.

 John Gallagher Jr. is youngest brother Timmy, a typical teenager whose main service to the plot is to provide marijuana to his mom who is fighting back the nausea of her cancer on the way to Thanksgiving dinner.

Oliver Platt plays Jim, the Dad that serves as the glue holding the disparate parts of the family together.  April talks to her Dad more than the rest of the family, and Jim keeps trying to reassure everyone else in the family that this trip is going to be a good experience for everyone.

Back at April and Bobby's apartment things are not going well while the Burns' drive for several hours from New England.  Bobby has an errand to run.  Roger Ebert didn't like the way this subplot makes the audience think one thing while something entirely different was going on, but Hedges plays with our expectations and prejudices and I disagree with Mr. Ebert that this lessens the film.  To say more would spoil.

While Bobby is out April, who we are told doesn't cook at all, is trying to put together a Thanksgiving feast.  The turkey is stuffed before she discovers that the oven has chosen the worst possible time to stop working.  Determined to make this meal work, April gathers up the turkey pan and trolls her tenement building trying to borrow even an hour of oven time.  Along the way she meets her neighbors and some of the nicest moments of the film are these interactions.  With April in her hour of need, not all of her neighbors are willing to help, but the ones who do are in the best spirit of Thanksgiving, which prompts April at one point to give a thumbnail version of the story of the Pilgrims and Indians to a Chinese family who graciously help her.

The movie is full of ""real"" moments, sometimes moments of heartbreak and sometimes moments of hope and love and resiliency.  It is a movie for families and extended families.  The Mrs. And I give it two thumbs up.",1171497600,5,4144,4.535666218034994
1957555,5,B0000VV4OK,"What makes this film stand out is its humanity.  The most successful independent films are those that have well-rounded characters, and this is a stellar example.  Read some of the reviews here:  the authors have read so many different insights into these characters that you'd think they were talking about real people!

I liked this film when I first saw it, but when I caught the end of it on cable last night it brought me to tears, and here's why:  it's one of the very few movies I've ever seen that really comes to terms with our mortality.  A lot of people get killed in movies, but few confront death the way living, breathing people have to.  I'm not just talking about death, whose imminence hovers over Joy and the whole family through the movie; I mean the the experience or possibility of failure in the face of one's most sincere and heroic efforts, which is April's life story.  Every movie out of Hollywood tells you that you can make it if you just try.  This movie holds you in suspense with the possibility that failure may be unavoidable.

Maybe it resonated for me because, as a spouse of a disabled person, I've had more contact with our human limits than most people my age.  But I think anybody who has tried as hard as they can to reach for something or somebody and still come up short will recognize the pain of real life in these flawed, very human people.",1170979200,3,1385,4.4563492063492065

Pieces of April is a sweet and moving film about a girl named April, played by Katie Holmes (Dawson's Creek). She lives in New York City and invites her family to her home for a wonderful Thanksgiving meal. The family consists of 2 younger siblings (a camera-toting brother and an oh-so-perfect sister), a cancer-stricken mother, and a somewhat-hopeless father. But all hell breaks lose when April finds out her oven is broke and she is unable to cook the turkey. She soon embarks on an interesting journey to every apartment room in the building for help.

The witty script is memorable, along with Patricia Clarkson's performance as the mother. Sean Hayes also gives a good performance as one of the bizarre neighbors in the apartment building.

1957558,4,B0000VV4OK,"I am hopeful that Katie Holmes has not forsaken a promising acting career to become tabloid fodder and a Stepford wife for her couch-jumping husband-to-be. It's not that she strikes me as all that brilliant, but she does bring a relatable sense of humanity to her role as April Burns, a rebellious twenty-something girl who has defiantly moved away from her family's upstate home to a tenement in Manhattan's Lower East Side. Encouraged by her new boyfriend Bobby (who happens to be black), she invites her estranged family to Thanksgiving dinner where she will cook the whole meal in her tiny apartment. There is a tragic undertone to the event since her angst-driven mother is dying of breast cancer, and this may be their last meal together

Directed and written by Peter Hedges (who wrote the equally eccentric ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?""), the story bounces back and forth between April's hazard-ridden preparation of the meal and the Burns family's chaotic journey to the city. While the family trip will remind you somewhat of this year's ""Little Miss Sunshine"", April's adventure consists mainly of meeting her motley neighbors, all strangers at first, to borrow a working stove for her turkey. Among others, she runs into a friendly black couple, an obsessive vegan and an elderly Chinese couple whom she teaches the origins of the holiday. On top of this is an odd, racially-driven storyline involving Bobby's need to buy a suit while being pursued by some suspicious characters.

Shot in digital video by Tami Reiker and running only eighty minutes, the 2003 movie works toward an inevitable conclusion, but Hedges adds enough filmmaking idiosyncrasies to make it all seem more intriguing than it has any right to be. Among the supporting cast, Patricia Clarkson stands out as April's mother Joy, bringing a steely resolve as she crumbles under the surface. Oliver Platt is terrific as her put-upon husband Jim, as are Derek Luke as Bobby and Allison Pill as April's ""perfect"" little sister Beth. In little more than cameos which could have been excised, Sean Hayes plays a neurotic neighbor with a new stove and a pampered dog, while Dru Hill's Sisqo plays Bobby's friend Latrell. Hedges provides a nice commentary track on the 2004 DVD, which also includes a fifteen-minute making-of featurette.",1159315200,2,2311,5.047120418848167
1957559,4,B0000VV4OK,"An excellent indie film - I am guessing a great many people who saw it did so because of Katie Holmes, and thus may have been expecting something a bit more Hollywood.  Quietly measured and human-centered, this is an excellent example of another kind of film entirely.

I found PIECES OF APRIL to be engrossing and memorable, and it's held up very well to repeat viewings.  Character development is a strong suit; ditto for the claustrophobic New Yorkiness (looking a lot like places inhabited by New Yorkers I know, in the clutter, and in the general diversity).  April, her family, her boyfriend, and her neighbors are given just the right amount of attention for us to feel that we know them well, in spite of the brevity of this film.

The humor - and there is plenty of it - is usually dry and quiet; the kind of comic presentation one would assume from the quotes on the DVD case are a bit misleading.  Beyond the humor, the overall story is touching - a conciliatory drama-with-humor about family and relationships that manages to capture the spirit of the holidays, without sliding into mawkish sentimentality.

Racial perceptions and prejudices are played around with in very wise ways here as well, and Derek Luke's performance as April's boyfriend is yet another treat.

All-in-all, an above average indie flick.

1957560,4,B0000VV4OK,"Katie Holmes is wonderful as April in this modern-family faces adversity, drama-comedy. The down and gritty Upper East Side is home to Tom Cruise's paramour. No wonder he locks her up: she's cute, but maybe she shouldn't be playing the out-of-place suburban kid that couldn't fit in.  She really doesn't have the piercing and tattoos her father talked about in the car trip as the family remember all the horrors of April's childhood.  Apparently, she liked to play with fire.

I had the usual ugly racial moment when the film opened with April sleeping with the black kid, Derek Luke.  I got over it and enjoyed Luke's low key performance. He wants to buy a nice suit for the Thanksgiving dinner April is throwing for her parents. I first thought he was trying to score drugs.  He's black isn't he? Well, it's not clear how April and Bobby make a living.  They don't appear to be drug addicts.  There's no pot or booze in their gritty apartment. I thought that was a bit of a whitewash of their lifestyle, but again, there's a sweetness here in a Katie Holmes vehicle that elicits the PG 13.

Most of the film revolves around April yearnings to present a middle-class Thanksgiving for her family. Her mom is dying and her dad and siblings are cringing. Patricia Clarkson hams it up as the breast cancer victim that hates her eldest daughter. Her family is on the verge of tears through most of the car trip from the burbs into the dangerous city.  The conflict between these opposites presents the tension along with a problem turkey situation. There's plenty of interesting city types in the film to investigate and I don't seem to be bothered by the ""flaws"" other critics have described.",1158796800,,1690,4.6632996632996635
1957561,5,B0000VV4OK,"I had heard of this movie years ago and thought the premise sounded funny, but never made any effort to see it. I happened to notice it in the video store the other day and when I saw that Sean Hayes was in it, my memory of it came back and I thought, ""Okay, sure, with Sean, it has to be at least entertaining.""

I really wasn't prepared for how deeply funny, sad, and brilliant this little film was.

Let's get past the problems first: Bad lighting, amateurish camera angles, okay, yes. But the story about wayward reject April (Katie Holmes, who was so brilliant and perfect that I can't understand what has happened to her career -- oh right; Tom; oops!) and her desperate attempt to prepare Thanksgiving dinner for her estranged family, in the most hellish apartment building in NYC, is superb.

Some of the lines come out of nowhere and just force you to laugh, they are so funny and true. And Patricia Clarkson as the mother with cancer and Oliver Platt as her loving, keep-positive-at-all-times husband, were just simply outstanding.

The movie keeps moving at all times and along with its funny-tragic plot, and its sad little subplot of boyfriend Bobby (Derek Luke) trying to find a nice suit to impress April's family, just takes a hold of you and drags you in to this dysfunctional family's world and insists you go along for the ride, whether you like it or not.

Sean Hayes did not have the big part I thought he did, but indicated without a shadow of doubt his off-kilter comic timing that cinched him the part of Jack on ""Will & Grace."" The only thing that was questionable is why in the world would he have been living in this delapidated hell-hole with his purebreed dog and his spanking new oven? The other residents, including a nutcase vegan, a staggeringly funny Lillias White as the woman who first lets April into her apartment to use her oven (for a few hours), and an entire Chinese family who patiently listen to April's valiant attempt to explain the history of the United States -- all of it was just outstanding. I loved it, loved it, loved it. (Did I say I loved it?)

Yes, you will have to get over the atrocious lighting (hello people -- ever hear of LIGHTS?), and if you have claustrophobia you might freak out at the feeling of being in tight, crammed little apartments, but if you can get past those things and you enjoy out-there humor with a tinge of tragedy, you're in for a treat.

1957562,4,B0000VV4OK,"Katie Holmes stars in ""Pieces of April"", an interesting film about thanksgiving and family.

Katie Holmes plays April. She's a bit of the black sheep of her family and something of a rebel. She's moved to New York and went out with a drug dealer, but now she's trying to put her life back on track. She's got a caring new boyfriend (Derek Luke), who she lives with in their modest, kind of run down apartment. April's family is to visit them for thanksgiving this year, and she really wants to get things right, especially since it might be her mother's last thanksgiving dinner, as her mother has cancer. Everything should be fine, April thinks, she's got all the cooking figured out in her head, she just has to do it. Doing the cooking, however, becomes a little more difficult when April's oven breaks down. Left with no other choice, April goes from door to door of her building, looking for a place to cook her turkey, even if it's only for a couple of hours. Will April manage to piece together a perfect meal? A resonable meal? Will she manage to make a meal at all?

This film was done with digital video, which I think has its advantages and disadvantages. Being digital, the image is fairly crisp, which means all the cooking scenes are really clear. You can see she's not working in the cleanest kitchen, or on the most delicious turkey, or using the best ingredients. Being video, it looks a little lower budget than your average film, which kind of emphasizes the smallness and delapidation of the apartment. I could have lived without all the shaky camerawork though.

I found this in the comedy section of my DVD store, but it's more like a drama, I think. There are funny moments, but they kind of rise out of the situation, rather than being played for laughs. There are sad moments, moments of tension, a whole range of emotions. Gets a bit grim, and a little depressing at times, but then again, it could have been done a lot worse.  Most of the characters are likeable, and when they're not, you can understand where they're coming from.

I quite liked the soundtrack, which seemed to feature quite a lot of songs by the Magnetic Fields and a band (according the subtitles) called ""6ths"". Magnetic Fields are on a list of bands I've been meaning to check out, so it was nice to hear some music from them.

Special features include 15 minute behind the scenes piece called ""All the Pieces Fit Together"", which contains rehearsal footage and interviews with the cast. There's also an audio commentary from the director and the original theatrical trailer.

Not what I expected, but interesting enough. Worth a look.",1155340800,,2634,4.627408993576017

Her mother is played by Patricia Clarkson (oscar-nominated role),her character is cruel, moody, and trying her hardest to make amends with her rebellious daughter. April invites her family to her apartment for a ""nice"" Thanksgiving dinner, things go array when April discovers her oven is not working.

1957565,4,B0000VV4OK,"Upon hearing a synopsis of this movie, I was immediately reminded of a favorite episode of ""Dr. Katz"" (bring back Dr. Katz!), and on that basis decided to view ""Pieces of April"". Here Katie Holmes gets to play the Ben Katz role of trying to prepare a Thanksgiving turkey for her nutso family, only instead of burning it (""Fire in the hole!""), she discovers that her oven doesn't work at all. Hence she must go door-to-door in her 'rustic' NYC apartment building; meanwhile her parents and siblings are piling into the family station wagon in suburban NJ for their much anticipated-with-trepidation journey.

When April (Holmes) knocks on the door of a black couple's apartment asking for help, the woman's response provides the movie's best laugh-out-loud moment. But then director Peter Hedges shrewdly spares us the tediousness of April's full-blown explanation of her family and her predicament; as viewers we are only privy to a limited amount of information. This technique provides a certain amount of mystery to the story, and serves to maintain one's attention throughout, as it's anyone's guess as to just what might happen next. ""Pieces of April"" is NOT a tired and predictable hackneyed script, and all of the actors are well-suited for their roles. Derek Luke is April's not-yet-introduced to the family boyfriend, and Patricia Clarkson and Oliver Platt are April's parents. There is more to the story regarding April's parents, but I won't reveal it here. Let Peter Hedges give you a brief background on the 'special features' section of the DVD, in a sincerely moving moment.

""Pieces of April"" is a ""small"" film, but it's no small achievement to produce a Holiday movie about family relations and relationships without hype and hokiness. Congratulations to everyone involved in this project.",1142985600,2,1806,5.11864406779661
1957566,5,B0000VV4OK,"Katie Holmes plays April, a young woman whose family has despaired of her.  She has invited them for Thanksgiving dinner, and it's particularly important because her mother (Patricia Clarkson) has cancer and is not expected to live. Katie is living in NYC with her boyfriend in the kind of grafitti-covered apartment building filled with an odd assortment of tenants that is only to be found in NY -- in other words, it will terrify her non-urban family.  The film begins as Katie wakes up -- she's never cooked a big dinner like this before and has a reputation for failure with her family.  In fact, her family puts her down so much that you quickly feel sorry for her -- no-one could be that bad, and isn't your family supposed to have an unnaturally high opinion of you, and not the other way around?

Patricia Clarkson was amazing in this film; she is batty but at times her battiness is just simply playing with her family (there's a method in her madness).

My only criticism would be that the whole subplot about what Katie's boyfriend is off doing while she's *trying* to cook the turkey -- well, that subplot just didn't work for me.

Otherwise, this was a memorable film worth watching more than once.",1134691200,2,1212,4.613953488372093
1957567,5,B0000VV4OK,"thank god for POA! Katie Holmes is a great actress, but her roles up until this point, have proved otherwise. she's the best thing about all her films, but she never has to do much. in this film, she convincingly portrays a daughter estranged by her family more by their doing than hers. She didn't have to overact in this film to stand out, she stood her ground because she had a solid script to work with. this movie was very well rounded because it has perfect mix of comedy and drama. You really see how hard she's trying, so when things don't go as planned, you really feel for April. I really enjoyed everyone's performances  in this film: from the father caught in the middle of everything, to the perfect child Beth, put on a pedastool not on her own, but by her mother. Jimmy the brother, that you're not really sure what to think of. he's just kind of there to make eveyrone's life easier. does what is needed. (including rolling his mothers joint. classic scene)  Grandma Dottie suffers from alzeihemiers, but movie alzhemiers. you know the one. the kind that allows her to deliver the perfect one liners at the best time, therefore only allowing her to know what is going on, when necessary.

it is a slow film, and you must be willing to emotionally invest a lot, to enjoy it. but all the quirky people in this film make it utterly charming!

1957568,5,B0000VV4OK,"This movie was so touching.  It's crazy because this reminds me so much of my family it's almost depressing.  So April (Played by the ever wonderful Katie Holmes in what I believe to be her best performance ever) is cooking thanksgiving dinner for her estranged family including her dying mother Joy (Clarkson in an amazing role deserving of her oscar nod), her overwhelmed and loving father Jim (Platt in an equaly impressive role, for him that is) and her two siblings, Timmy and the annoying, want-to-slap-her-in-the-face-and-call-her-a-b!+@# sister Beth.  Oh yeah, and her grandmother.  So the family travels across the state to NY to see April, while she struggles to bake a turkey.  Her boyfriend Bobby (Luke) tries to make everything alright and is very optimistic about the outcome of the day.  You'd think that a film about baking a turkey would be boring, but it's soooooo much more than that.  This film is about acceptance and family and most importantly love...as April puts it perfectly, it's realizing that you can't do it alone.  This is a very underrated film with a great cast that gives the best performaces of their carrers here and I feel need a little more recognition for that.  Katie Holmes is slated as the cute one from Dawson's Creek, but given a few more roles like this one and she may see an oscar in her future...I would recomend this movie to anyone, it's that good...giving you a look at what real life is like, what your actions have on your family and how anyone at anytime can change...it's all about making memories, new memories to counteract the bad ones.",1124064000,,1594,4.788321167883212

1957571,4,B0000VV4OK,"Holidays for many mean an opportunity to assemble the complete family - both the desired and undesired members.  Pieces of April is a film about such an event where April Burns (Katie Holmes) attempts to attract her family to her home in New York for the first time, as the family considers her the black sheep.  Throughout most of the film, the audience gets to learn how much the Burns dislike her while April's little sister, Beth (Alison Pill), repeatedly tries to convince her mother, Joy (Patricia Clarkson), to stay at home or turn around.  Nonetheless, Joy remains firm in her conviction to visit April while she habitually spews out something spiteful about her daughter April who seems to have been a real horror as a child at least according to her family.

Underneath the surface there is also something much more painful that all members of the family try to consider, as the Burns leave to visit April in New York.  Initially, it seems as if Joy suffers from bulimia while she devours doughnuts and later vomits intensely at a gas station bathroom.  However, it is not an eating disorder.  Nonetheless, there is clearly something wrong with Joy, as the family never seems to discuss this well-known family secret.  This leaves the family in a tense limbo where no one knows what to say or do, as they merely act upon what Joy tells them to do.  This happens while April becomes the verbal punching bag that they toss around on their short journey to New York City.

Throughout the Burns' trip, the audience can witness April's passionate, yet feeble struggle with April's gastronomical artistry while trying to cook the Thanksgiving dinner for her visiting family.  Nothing seems easy for April, but it also reflects a little of her thoughtlessness, as she scurries around in her apartment building for a functioning stove for the turkey.  In addition, the audience finds out why she has isolated herself from the family, which helps the audience understand why she has detached herself from the family.  Yet there seems to be something within April that recognizes the importance of the situation even though she is not looking forward to this event of thankfulness.

Pieces of April reminds a lot of other films that deal with the family connection over Thanksgiving such as Hannah & Her Sisters (1986), Ice Storm (1997), and What's Cooking (2000).  Despite these previous films Pieces of April reaches out to the audience in a new manner, which is both heartwarming and moving.  However, it does not succeed in reaching a level above these films, as it remains on a slightly lower level.  Nonetheless, the digital photography enhances the genuine atmosphere while the cast delicately handles the issues at hand, which delivers a kind and forgiving film in the spirit of Thanksgiving.",1114819200,2,2800,4.898305084745763

1957573,3,B0000VV4OK,"Judging by most of the reviews here, people overreacted to this little film that lasts barely more than 70 minutes. Patricia Clarkson may have gotten a best supporting actress Oscar nomination for her performance, but I'd say that speaks more to the quality of acting in 2003 than anything in this flick. Clarkson was good, not great. Her role was well-written but not memorable by any standard.

Having said that, I enjoyed this little movie, its humor and its situations. It's the story of a partially estranged family driving to New York to share Thanksgiving dinner with daughter-sibling April (played by Katie Holmes) at her apartment. The storyline shows there is a great deal of alienation between April and her family members, some of which they hope to overcome with this visit.

The movies is often funny and lithe, never pretending to be the kind of film reviewers here have portrayed it. It is a little film, a small entertainment, and one that is offbeat enough to attract people made cynical by big budget Hollywood flops.

""Pieces of April"" is, to me, a close copy of ""The Daytrippers"", another movie about a family driving around looking to make connections with a family member. But, while the acting and situations in ""The Daytrippers"" is uniformly outstanding and creative, respectively, there is little in ""Pieces of April"" that matches its skill. And while ""Pieces of April"" has a completely predictable ending, ""The Daytrippers"" concludes in a way no one could have guessed.

So keep these things in mind when reading the overreaction of critics here and elsewhere. ""Pieces of April"" is a funny diversion but it is not great filmmaking in any way. It will entertain you for an hour or so but you'll forget most of what you saw the next day.

1957575,4,B0000VV4OK,"I don't agree with the most recent reviews of this film, although I did enjoy it very much and do highly recommend it.  I don't think it's only about the mother's cancer but also about April and her mother's struggles.  The cancer is the agent that forces them to deal with one another at this particular critical moment, but the issues are bigger than the illness.  April is much more like her mother than either admits.  The mother clearly has some of April's spice in her that she has sacrificed to being a suburban wife, and her resentment of the compromises she has made adds to her pain at the rebelliousness of her daughter.  The image of Joy's addled mother's disapproval  makes clear that she has allowed much of her own spirit to be blotted if not broken.

Nor is this family a dysfunctional one.  In fact, they are a very loving family, which is why the ending is not such a surprise.  The father obviously adores the mother and the real tension in the family is among the women.  But tension and resentment don't make a family dysfunctional, but human.  There is brutal sibling rivalry between the two girls, and jealousy and envy between each of the girls and their mother, as well as a deep desire for approval, not always conscious.  The father clearly loves his rebellious as well as his more conventional daughter, and believes April will pull off a successful  Thanksgiving.  He is also used to serving as referee  among them.  But lots of calm and  loving spouses of both sexes do that for their more highly strung mates, it's more usual than not.

What is unusual in this situation is that April has matured and is in a loving relationship of her own, as she points out by telling her father that Bobby reminds her of her dad (the humor of course comes from Bobby being African American and not exactly Mr. Cleaver from the house in the NJ suburbs......the irony of course comes from the drug dealer boyfriend who is white and beats up Bobby just before Thanksgiving dinner, and just in time to freak out Mom and Dad.)  This allows her to recognize her love and need for her family, and to move away from her intense hurt and  resentment of her mother's conformity.

I think the writing and the performances in this film are great, and though Patricia Clarkson stands out (Academy Award nominated performance) and definitely MAKES the picture, the dad (Oliver Pratt) and the siblings, Bobby and the Grandma all do fantastic work.

I really found this film both charming and delightful as well as sad and TRUE. I don't want to tell the story because that would ruin it, but it reminded me a little of GARDEN STATE in that it is obviously inexpensively made, the work of talented actors and writer/director, yet more in a larval stage than fully developed.  But it makes you eagerly await what these artists will turn out next, and it tells a truthful story about life and love and the ways we face death.",1110585600,2,2923,4.568138195777351

LOL ... well I disagree, believe me if a movie crew and a director came into most families during a Thanksgiving dinner we would probably discover that many of our own family members could be considered as pretty wierd and dysfunctional. Matter of fact I'd kinda say a dysfunctional family is the normal family ... Yup the days of June Cleaverand 'the Baeaver' are long long gone .....

April Burns played by Katie Holmes decides to invite her estranged family for a Thanksgiving dinner at her pretty well slum like apartment in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. She gets up in the morning to find her gas stove broken, her boyfriend has already left to surprise her by buying a new suit, and the turkey is frozen. On the other hand her family is driving to NY and needless to say there is a lot of trepidadtion cause April is the black sheep of the family. April's mom played by Oscar nominated (for this role) Patricia Clarkson is a cancer victim and pretty wild in her own right. It's not a stretch to imagine mom and daughter getting together and sparks literally flying ....

Although Clarkson got the nomination I think that Katie Holmes playing April is nothing short of stupendous and plays a very very believable and lovable role without coming across as white trash .....

Loosely: April is living with her boyfriend in a crappy NY apartment and palns a Thanksgiving dinner for her parents and siblings. The place is filthy; the sink is scary, but April works it into a managed thing when the oven fails to light.

Based on a real story and combined with the director's real-life mother's battle with cancer, two sides to a common story crash into each other with the help in interferrence of some wonderful neighbors in the building and a few people along the way.

1957580,5,B0000VV4OK,"Peter Hedges, the original novelist/screenwriter of 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape?', makes an impressive debut with this touching, off-beat comedy drama, which was made with only (supposedly) about $300,000 budget.  And Patricia Clarkson got a well-deserved Oscar nonimation for playing the role of terminally-ill mother Joy Burns with a very wicked sense of humor, who is taking a Thanksgiving holiday to meet her long-estranged daughter April (Katie Holmes in punk costume) in Downtown, New York City.

In the meanshile, April, who is certainly not the best cook in her family, should prepare for the Thanksgivinig Day dinner.  A turkey must be roasted in oven, which turns out broken.  She knows this will all end up with a disaster, but her kind boyfriend Bobby (Derek Luke, who was 'Antoine Fisher' in Denzel Washington film) is buying a suit for the party, so she cannot back up.

The camera switches back and forth between her last-minute efforts and her family in a car heading for NYC (driven by underrated Oliver Platt, who shows very unexpected tender side).  During the whole drive, you see Patricia Clarkson, with her deep voice and a sly humor sense, rules the family.  She must be obeyed (and she is ill, isn't she?).  And we are quite amused, coming to like her for and despite her faults, which perhaps were the original reason of April running away from her home.

The film is digitally shot, the music is sparce, and the running time is only 80 minutes.  Perhaps the director wanted more budget to prolong the story, but the existing film can stand on its own.  Some may disagree with me, but I like this film as it is ... even though I prefer much clearer, clean-cut, traditional movies shot with film.

'Pieces of April' is strongly recommended as a well-made drama, and if you are kind of a person who shares such emotions as 'Home for the Holiday,' this is the one.

1957581,5,B0000VV4OK,"Many of us know that Thanksgiving as a holiday can be about as exciting as Arbor Day or Flag Day.  We eat a good deal, we watch football, we make smalltalk with people we see about three-four times annually.

However, Thanksgiving provides a tremendous backdrop as the impetus for portraying family dysfunction.  I think the reason many of us see this as boring is because our expectations of what family should be is often met...not so with our onscreen counterparts.  To them...the goal is yet to be reached (thus, family holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas are about reaching that often obtainable goal...family unity.)

That being said, Pieces of April does a remarkable job of showing just why this family doesn't work.  We see April at the onset in a shoddy New York apartment, whose appearance suggests that of youthful rebellion.  We know right away that she is the ""black sheep"" of the family after we meet the rest of her family.  We feel as they are though the model family, with the concerned father, the sickly mother (who wants more than anything to see her daughter), the aspiring photographer son, and the other daughter...an operatic prodigy.

However, after watching the movie, we see where the problems reside.  April, having her share of hard times, is trying to reconcile.  She works herself into a tizzy, attempting to find a working oven (discovering hers is broken) so that she may have a cooked turkey.  The importance?  A cooked turkey is the crowning achievement that all is well with Thanksgiving (showing that we need all well with our family.)  Yet April encounters problem after problem attempting to get this turkey cooked (conflicting schedules, neurotic tenants, etc.)

Furthermore, we see the true nature of this family.  Mom does not have a happy memory of her daughter (and makes fun of her skills on the trip down), son has a muddied head...possibly related to his ready stash of drugs on hand, daughter cannot bear a sibling being just as wonderful as she is, and father tries to do what he can to keep it together.

It is not until the mother's encounter in a restaurant bathroom that she discovers her own demons and sets out to right the wrongs.  Pieces of April is honest and gritty, yet has a heart.  Despite our demons, we all want the same things.  We want to matter to each other, we want to fit in...we want (for all intents and purposes), for that turkey to be successfully cooked.",1107043200,,2435,4.766109785202864

It would be easy for this to have turned into a sentimental mess, but Hedges levens everything with humor and the exceptional cast keeps things sharp. The weakest scenes actually involve April's attempts to find a usuable oven in her building; a subplot involving Sean Hayes as a weirdo neighbor feels half-thought out.

April has volunteered to cook the big Thanksgiving dinner for her family and they have accepted.  However, April cannot cook and her family does not really want to see her.  The film illustrates the truth that the holidays are not always happily anticipated by everyone - some families, in fact, dread being together.

As April attempts to cook the turkey, she encounters her diverse neighbors in the run-down apartment building, each with their own quirks and pain.  The film is both gritty and uplifting.

When April struggles to explain to the Asian family how Thanksgiving first came about, you see her stumble onto the true meaning of the holiday.  Which is that these people from opposite worlds realized that they ultimately need each other.  Suddenly you realize that little has changed since Plymouth Rock, afterall.",1103587200,2,987,5.19620253164557

She had previously captured my attention in Far From Heaven the year before. I was very touched by her performance, because her portrayal of a dying woman(Joy) trying to reconnect with her estranged daughter April(Katie Holmes). Her performance was both funny and emotionally impacting.
Katie Holmes was wonderful, because she effectively represents majority of runaways or abandoned adolensce these days. She looked great with all the funky hair and clothes, and her boyfriend Bobby(Derek Luke) is a sweet guy. Her [...] neighbour(Sean Hayes) was so pathetic, that he wanted a favor in return for borrowing his oven to bake the turkey. She eventually had to turn to her Chinese neighbours for help. It was funny at first, 'cause they didn't speak any English. Thank God, the turkey was baked on time.
Meanwhile, Joy,and her other ""good"" daughter, and her husband are on the way from out of town to visit April. Joy was freaking out the last minute. She kept thinking that it was not going to work, because she had no happy memory with April. When they got to the outside of the apartment building, they bumped into Bobby with blood on his face. They were shocked by the neighborhood, and her bleeding her bleeding Black boyfriend, and drove away simutaneously.
The moment Joy saw a little girl in the restaurant's restroom, she was instantly reminded of the years when April was a little girl, and she decided to go back by taking a ride from a biker outside the restaurant.
April was devastated, and just when she thought she was going to celebrate Thanksgiving with her neighbours, someone was knocking at the door.....This is the moment when everyone was smiling and crying at the same time.

Although a slow-moving story by some standards, this film never resorted to cheap tricks or cliches.  By introducing us to its flawed and likeable characters, ""Pieces of April"" drew us in from the beginning and led us to an emotional conclusion.  We found ourselves laughing out loud as April tried to prepare for her first Thanksgiving in years with her family.  We wondered how she would pull it off, and would her boyfriend make it to the dinner?  We waited for the fireworks to fly as the emotionally charged, bitter, diseased, and warm characters headed toward their inevitable meeting.

Everything, yet nothing, is inevitable in this film.  Katie Holmes proves her acting depth.  The screenplay is honest and funny.  And by playing his cards just right, the director grabbed our hearts.  We hugged on the couch and agreed this would become a Thanksgiving tradition.",1101427200,4,1114,4.830687830687831

Nice in that it also captures something like the real New York, continents away from the phony sets of ""Friends,"" with cramped apartments, wacked-out neighbors and the occasional threat of violence. The weakest link is sadly Katie Holmes, who is just too white-bread to play a Northeasterner, even  a slumming suburban gal.

1957593,4,B0000VV4OK,"This film was not an instant love. It took me a while to get into the story and I found myself more interested in the part showing April's family ""on the way to April"" then with April's preparations for Thanksgiving dinner with the family she has not seen for a long time. The family story and all its layers are exposed along the way whereas April more or less stays on the same level --- she has already ""made peace"" with her family at least mentally and is willing to make the effort to invite them over. The major truth April reaches throughout her day is the fact that she did not know how important the dinner was for her and what she is willing to go through in order to achieve her goal. The mother ""on the way"" is off course the central figure in the inner and outer journey the family is undergoing. The trip is a sort of account she makes with herself and with her children. Beth, the perfect child, the one who has been a mirror image of her and a constant reminder to what she used to be. Beth does everything according to expectations and according to what she thinks will please. She seems however to demand (this is how the father feels) a constant reassurance that she is in fact doing the right thing. The mother is not in ""Beth"" place any longer, Is she closer to the brother, who gives her pot for smoking or is she, after all is said and done, closer to April, the rebellious, rejected child? The mother has no positive memory from April and indeed the whole family has undergone a process of alienation from April. It is very convenient for them that April is in New York, far away from them, not to remind them of their failures with her. This trip forces them to think of her again and in some way evaluate what went wrong with their relations, and thus explore their own souls, as the mother verbalizes. Each member of the family has his own part in the family unit. The son, supporting the mother in his way but never saying a word and the father, trying to please his wife. It seems that their trip also tells us of the long way they made until they reached this day -- the different behaviors the father is now willing to accept from his wife, after her sickness, which no doubt were considered a no do in the past.

April during her preparations day undergoes an inner turmoil herself and suddenly needs to ask for the help of strangers. With some, this is a warm encounter and with others a sore point. Is this some indication to the way she struggled through her personal life? We see the tender relationship she has with her black boyfriend and therefore her family's reaction to him hurts the viewer as well as it does April.

I enjoyed the last part, presented in ""snapshots""and not as a regular movie piece and by the end of the movie I was captivated.",1097366400,2,2787,4.337164750957855
1957594,3,B0000VV4OK,"Pieces of April (Peter Hedges, 2003)

Hedges, the screenwriter for both the wonderful What's Eating Gilbert Grape? and the execrable About a Boy, turns his hand to directing with Pieces of April, a little movie that could. Katie Holmes is the title character, estranged from her family, who, upon learning her mother is dying, invites the family to her lower east side apartment for Thanksgiving dinner. Except that April and kitchens have never gotten along, and what's worse, her oven is broken, so she's forced to enlist help from the neighbors, never an easy thing to do in New York City.

The other half of the story is her parents' roadtrip from... somewhere (presumably upstate). Dad and Mom are played by Oliver Platt and Patricia Clarkson. Clarkson is never less than wonderful (and the seeming clause in her contract that she must be nude at least once in every film is fulfilled here in the most creative and poignant of ways) and is one of the pieces, along with Holmes, that would make this film worth watching no matter what. Platt is mostly relegated to stereotypical father-on-roadtrip behavior, unfortunately. The two kids, played by character actors Allison Pill (Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen) and John Gallagher Jr. (guest spots on Law and Order and NYPD Blue, among others) exist, as with all roadtrip movies, solely to annoy the parents. The senile grandmother (Alice Drummond, if you don't know the name, you'll recognize her) is mostly there for comic relief, but does offer a pointed line now and again. If they'd landed Estelle Getty for the role, this might be more comedy than drama.

Meanwhile, April is soliciting help, and her new boyfriend Bobby (Derek Luke, the title character in Antwone Fisher) is out ""doin' that thing."" To say what the thing is would spoil the movie's most subtly-done setup, so we'll just say it involves Sisqo. Yes, that Sisqo.

It's funny at times, dramatic at times. Predictable, but this is a feel-good movie, so you expect that. (And Hedges does some wonderful things with actually getting everyone there.) The climax is of the so-heartwarming-you-want-to-puke-poodles variety, but Hedges manages to keep the cheese-and-sugar factor low enough to be manageable. This is due in no small part to the movie's almost complete lack of musical score; any music in that scene would have been a disaster.

A minor film, but fun if you have a tolerance for cheese. ***",1096502400,2,2426,4.936274509803922

1957597,3,B0000VV4OK,"Movies seldom come cheaper than Pieces, the film was shot on a shoestring of $200 grand, on digital DVs, in a matter of 3 weeks. And it shows, the quality is grainier than modern home cams, but to look on the bright side, it accentuates immediacy and realism.

We get off to a leisurely start with a cliched holiday-movie setup: a dysfunctional family getting together at Thanksgiving in a small NY apartment. The screenplay looks promising in the beginning, as it cuts between a daughter clumsily attempting her hand at cooking while the quirky members trudge along rancorously to NY.

The humor largely derives from comically inept food preparation, or from the mother (Clarkson) battling cancer by smoking joints and listening to Smack Daddy. While Clarkson is feisty in fending off self-pity with cynical combativeness, the problem runs deeper -- the film's tragi-comic line fails in many bits.

We broach sensitive subjects, disease, decline, death, in much the same vein as ""Les invasions barbares"" did in recent memory, though the latter was decidedly more intellectual and political. Pieces focuses instead on balmy relationships.

About an hour later it began to grow on me a little, thanks to some character development and occasionally even shrewd observational humor, but by then it was too late as the ordeal lasts a piddly 90 minutes.

1957598,4,B0000VV4OK,"This is the sort of film that indie-flicks should be -- a small well-developed cast and a tight little script. ""Pieces of April"" is a bittersweet little feel-good movie. It tends to stumble when it focuses on April and her turkey, but the scarred sentimentality and wry comedy make up for that.

April (Katie Holmes) is a pigtailed wild child in a dingy New York apartment. She and her extremely understanding boyfriend Bobby (Derek Luke) have invited her estranged family to dinner, even though resentment still bubbles on each side. Her mother Joy (Patricia Clarkson) is seriously ill with breast cancer, the reason why they want to get together to make ""happy memories.""

The family travel to New York, questioning why they are going, especially since none of them have ever gotten along with April. Meanwhile, April discovers that her stove is broken, and goes on a wild chase through the apartment building, trying to find an available oven to roast the bird in before her family arrives. After a few dead ends (including a creep whose toupee she steals), she manages to find a lovely family who helps. But that might not be enough to bring her family into her life...

""Pieces of April"" is a good mix of comedy and drama, taking a look at family, love, and togetherness. No overwhelming soundtrack. No costly sets. Not even a terribly original idea. Only a couple of major names. Yet it does manage to be a sweet little flick that will leave you smiling, especially as the neighbors cluster together in April's apartment for the dinner they helped her to make.

This is also Peter Hedges' directorial debut, after penning movies like ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" and ""About A Boy."" He takes a little too much advantage of the shakycam, but it actually adds a slightly more realistic feel. And it's wincingly funny as Holmes frantically flails through food preparation, trying to get cranberry sauce out of the can, and mashing raw potatoes.

April's comedic dash through the apartment building is the most lightweight part of the whole thing. At times it gets too thinly stretched-out and even a little dull. And a bit silly -- calling the cops to report a kidnapped roast turkey? Her family's trip to New York -- where they wrestle with their old demons and resentment -- is the real plot, and where Hedges really gets to shine. It's tense, funny, sad, and full of genuine feeling.

Katie Holmes is sadly given little to do except rush around looking stressed. But it's Patricia Clarkson makes this movie -- facing her own illness and mortality, she snarls, purrs, cries and looks back on her life. John Gallagher Jr. and Alison Pill are good as April's photographer brother and insufferably snotty sister, Oliver Platt is decent as April's supportive dad, and Derek Luke is nothing short of delightful as April's loving boyfriend.

""Pieces of April"" is the opposite of a summer blockbuster -- well-written, amusing and well-characterized. Worth watching with your loved ones around you.",1094342400,9,2995,4.883858267716535
1957599,4,B0000VV4OK,"Writer/director Peter Hedges' (What's Eating Gilbert Grape?) charming and tiny independent film Pieces of April is surprisingly and unquestionably one of the best pictures of the year. April is expertly filmed with a digital video camera and the scenes of the Burns family often reminded of a family road trip that you might see on Wonder Days. And the edgy April character is likely to go down as one of my favorite and most memorable in a film this year and in a long time.
April Burns (portrayed by the lovely Katie Holmes) lives in a claustrophobic apartment in a less-than-glamorous area of New York City with her boyfriend, Bobby (Derek Luke). April, being 21 years old, and having left her highly dysfunctional family, is hosting Thanksgiving. Her parents, Joy (Patricia Clarkson) and Jim (Oliver Platt) are hesitant to attend because of bad memories with their rebellious daughter. Their other daughter, Beth (Alison Pill) is a controlling and critical menace who doesn't allow her mother to breathe. Joy has cancer and her family is becoming increasingly concerned about her and how much time she has left in her life. The son Timmy (John Gallagher, Jr.) takes pictures of everything the family does for Joy to remember their lives by. The determined mother waits patiently in the car as the rest of the family begins to wake up, Beth rebelling and Jim confused about how to react. April has Bobby leave so that she can focus on the challenging tasks at hand which she finds very difficult to complete. Her oven breaks and she is forced to wander the halls of her apartment building in search of a working stove for her heavy and lazily stuffed turkey. The family's dysfunctions begin to surface as April races to make the dinner-and she is unsure if it will amount to an avail.
The digital camera gives Pieces a home video quality and allows for a more intimate portrait of this family and their lives. Katie Holmes stars in her best role ever-and her most fulfilling performance. The entire cast is magnificent and veteran Patricia Clarkson will likely find a supporting actress Oscar nomination for her work done here. Ms. Clarkson embodies her character and lives and breathes it, giving the film its heart. She steals every scene she is in, and so does Antwone Fisher star Derek Luke. All the characters are so lovable-just like the film-and they will stay with you for long after you view the film.
The one staggering sidestep in Pieces of April can be forgiven because everything else is just so good. Sean Hayes is a serious miscast as a neighbor who takes April's turkey ""hostage."" Hayes is off the screen very quickly so it doesn't impact the film to a great degree. The screenplay is quirky and original with witty dialogue and some hilarious, low-key humor is scattered throughout the film. April is also poignant and deeply touching, with an ending that brings the film full circle, and an original approach to storytelling that takes a sad story of a sad family and shapes it into an enchanting and very powerful comedy-drama. It's a witty, often bittersweet and sad, film about life and the different ways of living it. One of the best 20 pictures of 2003 without a doubt and is better than any Hollywood explosive epic film out there.",1089504000,2,3259,4.780141843971631

1957601,3,B0000VV4OK,"My expectations for this film were not overwhelming high: a dark family comedy with a pleasant indie feel. The movie came halfway there. Obviously, the casting of Katie Holmes was a major selling point for the film. Unfortunately, Ms. Holmes did not do her homework on the role and no punk-rock Halloween costume can change that. Her portrayal of April lacks depth and believabilty. Ms. Holmes' stock doleful expression does not do enough to express the character's inner angst. Maybe April is supposed to be whiny and self-absorbed, but the audience also supposed to care. (Just as an aside, if you are going to do a love scene, do a love scene. Otherwise, don't do it at all.) Derek Luke's performance as  Bobby, April's saintly boyfriend, is great. However, the fact that the character's race is apparently meant to shock April's conventional parents and the audience is stupid. While I do like Oliver Platt, I feel he was miscast as April's father. I just do not believe he would be married to Patricia Clarkson's character. Ms. Clarkson does an admirable job as April's ill, bitter mother. I do feel her Oscar nod was for her body of work and not just this role. The rest of the cast did well, particularly Alison Pill as April's sister and Sisqo as Bobby's friend from the thrift store.

  Performances aside, the film felt flat. Frame after frame rolled by and I wondered, who are these people? Do I really care if April's turkey turns out okay? If April's family really hates her, why are they coming for dinner? Is their horrible attitude really warranted? None of those question were answered effectively.

  Unfortunately, much of what I like about the film was incongruous with the overall tone. I loved the array of diverse tenants depicted in April's NYC apartment building. I liked Bobby, April's boyfriend, who would anything to help out with April's dinner. I even liked the happy ending, however tacked-on it felt. All of these elements subscribe to a generosity of spirit that is sadly lacking in the rest of the film.

April is played by the brilliant Katie Holmes, this role being one that makes you go, ""Wow, she actually can play someone other than Joey Potter."" She proves that she really is a fantastic actress.

The movie was only about eighty minutes long, and half of those eighty minutes have a women named April cooking her Thanksgiving dinner. It got boring after a while. Katie Holmes played April, a young women who is kind of the ""black sheep"" in her family. She is living with her boyfriend, and it is her turn to prove to the family that she could host a good Thanksgiving. Patricia Clarkson was nominated for an Oscar for this movie, but there was nothing special about her preformance. She was actually the weakest link in this movie. The movie did have some touching moments, especially towards the end, but this did not leave a lasting empression in my mind. The comedy was also not funny.
April Burns is a young women who is getting ready to prepare Thanksgiving for her mother Joy, her father Jim, and her brother and sister Timmy and Beth. She is not the best one in her family, and is using the holiday as a way to make peace with them. Jim is the only one who is going to give April a chance, and the others don't give a care what she does. April's boyfriend Bobby wants April and her family to be happy with each other, and helps her prepare. April's oven breaks, and she is forced to find a replacment in her apartment building. She soon learns that it is almost impossible to find a spare oven during Thanksgiving. She does find married couple Eugene and Evette who tell her she can use the oven, but only for cooking half of the turkey. She does the other half from Wayne, a rather weird person who thinks his new oven, and his dog are the greatest things on the world. He does, however, take the turkey hostage, a problem April needs to deal with right away. The family is getting closer to April's house, while also dealing with Joy and how she is dying from cancer.
""Pieces of April"" was just not a great movie. It was only alright. It didn't have any memorable moments, or characters. The good part about it is that it's not very long, and it could only drag on for so little time. I liked the ending, but I couldn't see any character development that could resolve in the ending. This is just not Oscar material, and I watched Clarkson's preformance carefully to see if she deserved the nomination. Sadly, she didn't. ""Pieces of April"" was entertaining, but I don't think it would have been worth seeing in the theatres for those who saw it. I'm glad I saw it on video, and I don't think I'm planning on seeing it again. Once was enough.

The table is set for a film which intimately chronicles the estrangement and reuniting of an outcast child with her struggling family.

Joy wears a silly bouffant wig, she's nauseated from her chemotherapy and is tired of her family's constant solicitousness. The old ways aren't working for Joy anymore. Her illness has isolated and marginalized her the same way she has isolated and marginalized her daughter April. In the meantime, April discovers the turkey she bought is too big for the apartment's stove. She knocks on all her neighbors' doors to see if she can use their oven. April's neighbors treat her with the kindness and recognition that she's never received from her own family. Maybe April's not so ""bad"" after all. This is a beautiful, small film. Its plot is not only about April learning to see herself outside of her family's definition of her, but about Joy's coming to terms with the loneliness that that her illness brings. Only stubborn self-assertion can keep Joy alive and make her remaining months worth living. And who can understand that better than April, bravely setting the Thanksgiving table with her thrift-store dishes in the face of her family's disdain? It's the story of her life.",1085529600,,1547,4.95
1957607,5,B0000VV4OK,"Peter Hedges' ""Pieces of April"" is a profoundly moving movie and a testament to how a spirited and committed cast can weave magic on a shoestring budget.  My wife and I have been trying to tell everyone we know about this film.  The only *caveat* we give people is that it may be a little too close to home - the dysfunctional family combined with the angst of a Thanksgiving get-together.  The tensions revealed here could resonate with anyone.
Patricia Clarkson's standout performance has been justifiably well-documented elsewhere.  I want to add that I've never been a particularly big Oliver Platt fan, but he's really great here.  I can identify with the guy just wanting things to be alright for everyone and trying so, so hard to keep it all together.
The ending of the film is perhaps one of the best I've ever seen.  It'll just open the floodgates on your emotions.  A real triumph for Peter Hedges.",1085270400,,909,4.679245283018868
1957608,4,B0000VV4OK,"Oblique, graphic, funny, sad, real and immediate are the words that first pop into my head when I think of ""Pieces of April.""  It captures a mood that is unflinching in its depiction of the searing, profound stubborn yet pain people in families cause one another.  It also shows that humor can co-exist with pain and sadness in families.
April is the estranged daughter who invites her family, including her mother, dying of cancer, to Thanksgiving dinner.  The movie revolves around April's effort to cook the meal in a rundown Manhattan apartment and her family's journey from their middle class suburb to her home.  In the space of a few hours in the lives of a few people, issues of race, community, love, aging and family are explored in new and insightful ways.  There is a casual richness to ""Pieces of April"" that makes it more than the typical teen coming of age flick.
Katie Holmes plays April without much effort to convince us that she is a troubled teen estranged from her family.  She allows the story to reveal her character so that she affects us as a person and not a condition.  The same can be said of Patricia Clarkson who gives another one of her terrific supporting roles in quirky movies.  There is a fierceness to her portrayal of April's difficult mother and a willingness to be unappealing that ends up making us like her all the more.  Derek Luke give April's boyfriend a palpable sense of kindness and compassion which is impressive because his character is probably the one weak spot in the film.  The sequence where he goes out to do his ""thing"" plays too conventionally for this kind of film.  It also felt a little too politically correct to be believable.
That said, I finished the film in touch with my own sadness about what's lacking in my  family relationships yet hopeful about the possibility of change.",1085011200,,1842,4.6687306501547985
1957609,4,B0000VV4OK,"Joy, (Katie Holmes), the black sheep daughter of a dysfunctional family invites her cancer-diagnosed mother (Patricia Clarkson), father (Oliver Platt), siblings and grandma over to her apartment for a home-cooked Thanksgiving meal with her new boyfriend (Derek Luke). The family does not go willingly because of past conflicts with Joy.  This film follows two parallel narratives, one following the family's emotional journey on the way to Joy's, complete with numerous painful recollections of Joy's troubled childhood and the second is Joy's Odyssey getting the food for dinner cooked.  A basic premise, yes, but it is remarkable what writer and director Peter Hedges (About a Boy, What's Eating Gilbert Grape?) does with it.
""Pieces of April"" delicately deals with the serious issues of cancer and broken families by adding subdued humor in a tasteful manner.  I appreciated how Hedges managed to make the movie humorous without cheapening the subject matter.  All in all, I was very touched by this film and it would definitely make a perfect holiday film for the family with the message of appreciating your loved ones.
Katie Holmes was very impressive; this is, by far, her best performance to date.  Who knew the doe-eyed little teen queen from ""Dawson's Creek"" could pull of a darker, more emotionally-layered character so well?  The always-wonderful Patricia Clarkson is very passionate and powerful in her portrayal of a cancer patient and a pained mother.  She does not overplay her role, which easily could have come off quite cheesy in the hands of a lesser actress.
The film's short running time of 75 minutes left me wanting more; a rare and wonderful occurrence considering most films nowadays tend to drag towards the end.",1084924800,,1739,5.167259786476868
1957610,5,B0000VV4OK,"I first saw this movie at the theater the same day, a few hours after, I saw the third ""Matrix"" movie.  If there could be antidote to the obscure, big production, super-special effects extravaganza of ""Matrix Revolutions"" it is the simple and unpretentious ""Pieces of April"".  A very funny movie -- laugh out loud funny -- it presents a tangible space and real-to-life characters (particularly Katie Holme's April), all within just eighty-one minutes (actually less than seventy five minutes, if you don't count the end credits).
Usually independent films done as sparsely as this one have rambling and knotty plots, leaving a great deal to audience interpretation to understand what has happened and, usually, how we're suppose to understand the ending and what the movie was all about.  In contrast ""Pieces of April"" tells a simple linear story, with a beginning and an end, of a girl living in the city, estranged from her suburban family (particularly her mother, who has terminal cancer), fixing a Thanksgiving meal for them, yet finding herself in need of a working oven because at the last minute she discovers her own oven does not work, at which point she goes door to door in her apartment building searching for an oven not being used on Thanksgiving.  There's more to it than that, more characters and situations, but nothing that deviates in any serious way from the basic plot.  It's not a film that requires a mythic journey interpretation to appreciate it.  But that's not to say that it doesn't improve with successive viewings, that there isn't a depth that waiting to be explored.
""Pieces of April"" is about togetherness:  ""Once there was this one day where everyone seemed to know they needed each other; this one day where they knew for certain they couldn't do it alone.""  This theme is underscored by the use of  a home video format, where the audience is often stuck in intimate and small cramped spaces with the characters, many times the spatial relation bordering on the claustrophobic.  I really don't know if I've ever seen a more ""pro-family"" film (or I don't know what the term means, which is most likely the case).  The couple of good experiences April has in finding an oven to use are with families (one African-American and one Asian).  In contrast, the single people in her building are not willing to make the sacrifice because it might compromise one ""Vegan's"" belief system or, as is the case with ""Wayne with the new stove"", there might not be anything that he will gain in return.  For April family is salvation.  And family (or even community, for that matter) involves both sacrifice and compromise -- persons connected to their family have to put up with more and are used to being put out more for the sake of others.  It's often seems preferable and easier just to say ""I'm through, you're on you own"", as the mother says to the little girl in the restaurant bathroom towards the end of the film, the place where April's mother has her epiphany.  The eventual, inevitable reunion of April and her mother is not presented as a time of apologies or expressions of regret -- no words are expressed, mostly still pictures to music -- but we understand it as a recognition of the love that was always there but not acknowledged, and as an honoring of the stubborn strength in each personality that was always the major source of the conflict between them.
Please do not be distraught by my ""pro-family"" explanation.  This film is not even close to a platform for preaching right-wing conservative views about ""family values"".  You'll find plenty of good cynical humor in ""Pieces of April"", and many lovable cynical characters, but the film itself is far from cynical.  ""Pieces of April"" is a downright cute film, but cute in a good way.  Cute like ""About A Boy"" and ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" -- films with screenplays by Peter Hedges, the director and writer of ""Pieces of April"".
Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a lot of action movies.  I enjoyed ""Matrix Revolutions"".  But we need simple human stories -- we need more films like ""Pieces of April"" -- lest we forget what's really important.",1084665600,,4133,4.775280898876405
1957611,4,B0000VV4OK,"This is a hard one to rate. I gave it four stars, not because I liked it, but because many do. I didn't feel right about giving it two or three, because the fact I didn't care for it much doesn't mean that it is a poor excuse of a movie.
The problem for me was that most of this seemed like an exposition for the last minute or so. The ending saved it for me, very touching.
It is very ironic, though, that for some the ending is practically nothing in comparison to the rest. To me, I really didn't care that much for watching April struggle to cook the turkey and prepare the meal, nor the family struggle to come (although I liked that in some ways a little better).
Watching with the commentary (not that it is extremely informative, but enough to let one know what the writer-director Peter Hedges was trying to accomplish, and where the inspiration came from), did help me appreciate it more -- but I still cannot say that I liked it that much.
Yes, there are some strong general statements about human nature: When it comes to helping others, you have those who might seem tough and mocking on the outside but are warm and caring and helpful, and those who seem caring but are only interested in what they will get, and those who cannot understand what you are saying but can see into your soul.
While watching, it was obvious to me it would go one of two ways -- but in order to not spoil it for you I will not say. -- I will say that I can understand why it ends the way it does. To me, even though I didn't care for most of it, the ending wouldn't have worked without the prior structure of events. But for others, the ending was a flop.
So, liking PIECES OF APRIL will all depend on whether or not you enjoy watching April's struggle to cook the turkey, and her family's struggle(s) as they travel to be with her.",1083801600,,1824,4.214285714285714
1957612,2,B0000VV4OK,"I found this movie to be extremely boring. I'm sorry, but I did. I had read lots of positive reviews, read about the buzz this little indie film got and while I never had high expectations for it, I still was underwhelmed by it when I finally got to see it.
On the positive side, yes, Patricia Clarkson's performance was indeed worthy of an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress. She is the sole shining light in this project. The rest of the cast, including Miss Holmes, give so-so performances at best. It's not all their blame either. The characters they get to play are quite uninteresting and what I thought was a cool premise was completely wasted by the fact that there's no connection to be made between viewer and characters.
That cool premise I was telling you about? April (Holmes) the black sheep of the Burns family has invited them to spend Thanksgiving with her and her boyfriend Bobby (Luke). Her mom (Clarkson) is dying from cancer and none of her relatives know that Bobby is black, particularly her father (Platt). There are two storylines in the film, the first shows April suffering thru many ordeals (and a few weird neighbors) while trying to prepare the Thanksgiving dinner. The other one follows her family as they travel to April's place. They also go thru some stuff that's suppossed to be either funny or touching, yet I thought none of them were.
This movie was filmed with digital cameras, so it might look a little off. This is normal. Digital films don't look like celluloid ones (at least, not yet).",1083715200,,1539,4.682656826568266
1957613,3,B0000VV4OK,"I feel like I've seen this movie before & done better in 'The Day Trippers'- totally different plot- similar camera style-overall indie car trip feel.
While it's fun to watch April struggle with her vagabond turkey & to watch her oh so obnoxious sister be, well, obnoxious, the first 3/4's of the movie are just kinda boriing.
The last few minutes are magnificient- the still shots, combined with the live action camera work, blend into a seamlessly beautiful piece of art & moving finale.
I can't say I recommend it, but I don't NoT recommend it either.  I'm on the curb on this one.",1081987200,,584,4.615384615384615
1957614,4,B0000VV4OK,"PIECES OF APRIL is not the type of movie to take your breath away. It is predictable in many ways, yet it's also surprising enough of the time to make it well worth watching.  I call it a slight movie because it has relaxed pacing, a short running time and a low budget.  None of these are criticisms, per se...just trying to give you the idea that this movie FEELS like an independant film.  The movie is shot on digital video (...).  This is good, because a movie like this probably wouldn't get made at all if real film stock were used.  And I'm glad it WAS made...if only to enjoy some standout performances.
It tells the story of one family's trip to visit their ""troubled"" daughter (and sister) who now lives in New York City and has been more or less estranged (except for calls asking for money) for quite some time.  This is intercut with the drama of April trying to get the Thanksgiving dinner together for her family.  She obviously seldom cooks at all, because she discovers that her oven doesn't work.  Clearly, she's never TRIED to use it before.  So she is forced to go from neighbor to neighbor asking for help with cooking her turkey.  We meet the neighbors in some amusing (though a bit unbelievable) vignettes.  Katie Holmes plays April, and it's a good departure for her.  In the past, she's either been kinda ""sweet and innocent"" as in Dawson's Creek or trying to shock us with nudity.  In this film, she has rough edges, but there's no gratuitous flesh.  However, it's also hard to buy April as a REBEL.  She dresses the part, but never seems in the least bit threatening.  What, exactly, does she really have against her family.
The family, meanwhile, is just dealing with the stress of making the trip.  Patricia Clarkson is the mother, and she's clearly near the end stages of breast cancer.  Unspoken is the fact that everyone knows this will be her last Thanksgiving, and perhaps her last chance to ""make amends"" with April.  Oliver Platt is the long-suffering husband.  There are two teenage kids as well, along with grandma, whom they pick up from her retirement home.  Their little car is crowded with bickering, and sometimes, it gets to be a bit much.  However, there are some great moments too.  Clarkson gives a brave performance in the best written part.  She's not just the sympathetic victim.  She can be QUITE unpleasant, not afraid to snap at her family for imagined slights. We see how the stress of her affliction has amplified her weaknesses of personality.  Love comes through too, sometimes, but we see she's really turned inwards in many ways and isn't too anxious to make accomodations for the feelings of others. It feels believable, and Clarkson (a great actor) is superb.  And Oliver Platt has his moments too...particularly one brief scene where they've just reached the city.  He looks over to the passenger seat and sees his sick wife asleep.  Or IS she?? His momentary conviction that she has died stabs us through the heart. It turns out she isn't, but his fear and then his queesy relief are TOTALLY convincing.  It might be the best 15 seconds committed to an independant film in quite awhile.
Anyway, will they all get together?  How will it go?  This is somewhat predictable, but these scenes are presented with imagination enough to make us forgive some cliches.
The movie also features a nice performance by African-American actor Derek Luke.  I only mention the race, because as April's new boyfriend, we just KNOW that when the family meets him, there will be raised eyebrows at best.  We get to know him, and realise that HE is the reason April seems to be motivated to get her act together.  He has brought love and happiness and a desire to build a relationship to her life. He has also encouraged her to restore her fractured relationships.  It's a noble act he has performed, and Luke's warmth towards Holmes is touching.  So, we anticipate the family's first meeting with him.
The movie has a little harsh language, and Luke and Holmes have a bedroom ""tussle"" early on, so I don't recommend the movie for kids.  But it IS gentle and ultimately very affirmative.
Don't buy the DVD though.  It's not the type of movie you'll watch over and over (and it's only 81 minutes long) and the extras are SKIMPY at best.",1081814400,8,4278,4.645805592543276
1957615,5,B0000VV4OK,"I've seen largely glowing reviews, but a few highly critical ones of this movie.  I suspect part of the problem is with the brain-dead who are responsible for packaging feature movies and write the blurbs on the back.  When good movies come along that are complex, it's hard to write a catchy synopsis in 120 words, so you leave with what you think is a Katie Holmes snack and come home with a complex Thanksgiving feast.  What the back of the box should say is: ""Pay attention.  This is life.  It's funny, it's sad, and it will break your heart. And make you laugh.  For fluff see two boxes over.""
There's a lot going on here in a very short space of time and comparatively little dialogue - as much is said with what goes unsaid.  This is two stories that are threaded together - one half is the journey of the skeptical family bearing their terminally ill mother - once merely over-critical but now positively acidic since terminal cancer has freed her of any concerns about how her comments are received.  The other is the troubled, distanced daughter - the ""first pancake"" (the one you throw out) - who is trying to prepare a last gesture of a Thanksgiving meal at the behest of the men in her life, without any of the basic tools for the undertaking.  It is the last minute discovery that her oven doesn't work that drives her into the arms of strangers in her apartment building who may or may not spare her space in their oven, and, metaphorically, in their own stories.
I feel it's important to say when something in a movie rings particularly true, and in this case, the author wrote this while his mother was dying of cancer.  He does not blanche from the illness of Clarkson's character in this movie, and it is the source of much of the emotional immediacy as well as of the black humor.  Those who have survived this degree of illness, or who have shepherded family through it will recognize that peculiar black sense of humor that comes from being set apart in the way that systemic life-threatening illness does.  If you're ""part of the club"", this movie will leave you alternately laughing out loud and crying in your seat.
Most features spend 2 hours without getting this much out there.  Kudos to the writer/director, and to the cast for their exceptional grace in this film!",1081814400,2,2294,4.538834951456311

Black sheep `April' just wants to do something nice - like cook Thanksgiving dinner for her `none-too-eager' estranged family.  The film is split between the family's road trip to the New York apartment and the tribulations of April desperately trying to cook a huge meal she has never attempted before.  April's Mom (a fantastically complex Patricia Clarkson) is balancing all her emotions along with dealing with cancer.  Dad (a thankfully subdued Oliver Pratt) tries to manage his wife, dippy son, prissy, peppy daughter and his cute, but Alzheimer suffering Mother (Alice Drummond; always good, but give this woman a character change!).  The scenes are thankfully devoid of pratfalls and deliver real solid emotions and a few chuckles.  Meanwhile April is meeting all of her apartment building owners for the first time, seeking an oven that will cook her turkey in time.  This too, is full of small, precious moments that are subtle enough to ring true.  It never gets sappy and each character delvers a believable performance.  Even the ending is satisfying in a most unexpected way.
A commentary by director Peter Hedges gives a great deal of insight into film making from the heart and the featurette is adequate for one viewing.  The only other feature is the trailer.",1081728000,3,1348,4.977678571428571
1957618,4,B0000VV4OK,"Written and directed by Peter Hedges, ""Pieces of April"" is a droll little comedy with deadly serious overtones.  April is the black sheep of the Burns family, the one child of whom her mother has no fond memories.  Although from what we see of her, April seems to be a pretty decent young lady, it is obvious that her parents and her brother and sister harbor deep resentments towards her (her earlier involvement with drugs and drug dealers seems to be the primary cause of bitterness).  Well, it's Thanksgiving Day and April is attempting to mend some bridges by hosting this year's dinner at her cramped New York City apartment.  April is terrified of failure and her family members have little faith that she will be able to pull the event off.  Complicating matters even further is the fact that Joy, April's mother, is suffering from terminal cancer.
As a narrative, the film basically runs along two parallel tracks.  One involves April and her frantic attempts to get her dinner cooked despite the fact that her gas oven has suddenly stopped working.  This forces her to go up and down the hallway of her apartment building throwing herself on the mercy of her colorfully eccentric neighbors, some of whom offer their assistance and some of whom don't.  Hedges mines his richest vein of humor in this section, capturing the offbeat nature of both the people and the situation.  The other plotline - involving the family's reluctant trek from suburbia into the city - naturally carries with it far more serious overtones, dealing as it does with death, recrimination, family dysfunction and despair.  But even here, Hedges is able to inject some moments of wicked black humor into the proceedings.
Oddly enough, of all the characters, April is one of the least fully developed in the film.  She remains basically a passive observer and most of what we learn about her comes from comments made by various family members.  We have to take it on faith that she is such a loser and a troublemaker because we see very little evidence of it with out own eyes.  Certainly the most intriguing character in the story is the ironically named Joy, ironic because, even though her terminally ill status should elicit sympathy from the audience, her often-nasty disposition makes it difficult for us to like her.  This is Hedges' boldest touch, this refusal to sugarcoat or sentimentalize a person just because life and the fates have been unkind to her.  Also quite fascinating is the character of Beth, April's younger sister.  We see how Beth thrives on the positive attention she receives simply by being the ""good"" daughter of the family, and how she jealously and ever-so-sweetly guards her own position while subtly sabotaging any effort on the part of April to make amends and to find her way back into the fold.  It's a fascinating portrayal of sibling rivalry carried to destructive proportions.
""Pieces of April"" features wonderful performances by Katie Holmes as April, Oliver Platt as her father, Alison Pill as her sister, and Derek Luke (from ""Antwone Fisher"") as her boyfriend.  Particular praise should go to Lillias White, as the neighbor who supplies April with a stove at her greatest hour of need, and to Patricia Clarkson as Joy, who achieves the Herculean task of making her pain-wracked character both abrasive and sympathetic at the same time.  It's an award-worthy performance.",1081641600,,3397,4.9073426573426575

The film moves back and forth between her traveling family and April's frenetic but earnest attempts to cook the dinner.
""Pieces of April"" is also a testament to the fact that a wonderful and meaningful movie can be made for a small amount of money ($300,000) and in a short period of time. It is a quiet, unassuming film that will only appeal to those who do not need car chases, shootouts, and the like. It is difficult and thought-provoking but that is life, right?

1957624,5,B0000VV4OK,"I just finished watching Pieces of April on DVD and although a bit skeptical midway through the movie, I must say that by the end this film moved me as few others have in recent memory.  The story of a family traveling to their daughter for a holiday dinner is an oft told tale.  But in this case the daughter April has abandoned the suburbs of her parents home to live in the East Village quite unlike what her parents consider normal.  Once involved with a drug dealer and on drugs herself, now April hopes to forge a memory for her parents, brother, sister and grandmother this year. For April and her family may not have this chance again since April's mother is gravely ill and knows that her time is running out.
But then April finds the oven in her apartment isn't working, and she is force to rely on the goodness of her neighbor's to cook her turkey.  As April's parents travel to the city we watch their car ride as they reminisce about their family and April.  At the same time we watch as April forges friendships with her black neighbors, Asian neighbors and a strange man devoted to his dog.  The outcome is both surprising and heartbreaking as finally the family comes together in more ways than just a holiday dinner.
I watched the end of this movie crying as I thought of how families spend holidays, the lack of communication between generations within a family and often the lost opportunities within families as members move far away or die.
This is at times a difficult movie but it is a worthwhile and thought provoking film. In addition first rate performances by Katie Holmes as April and Patricia Clarkson as Joy, her mother, are wonderfully poignant and believable.

1957625,5,B0000VV4OK,"There is something absolutely amazing about ""Pieces of April"", the story of a 21-year old family black sheep who has invited her suburban family up to New York for a Thanksgiving feast that she has no idea how to prepare. April, played by Katie Holmes, has been estranged from her entire family for a long time, especially because of the horrible relationship she has with her mother, played venemously by Patricia Clarkson. The mother, Joy, is dying of cancer, causing even more strain on the relationship and bringing in the several themes of this movie.
One could call this a movie about family, or about the holidays, but I don't know if this is the whole point. This is about regret, and redemption, and being able to forget about the past and try to move on to a brighter future.
I have to say that I had never seen a family that is filled with so much hatred, as the entire family (save the father, played wonderfully by Oliver Platt) seems pitted against April, and completely convinced that her Thanksgiving will fail. I was impressed at the hate Clarkson acted with, really allowing the audience to lose sympathy for her despite her frail state and inevitable death.
I have to talk about the acting of Katie Holmes, because she is an absolute revelation in this film. So far in her film career, she has picked smaller roles, and acted them wonderfully. Examples of this are ""The Gift"", ""The Ice Storm"" and her incredible performance in ""Wonder Boys"". She has only made a couple of attempts at lead roles, and those were in more teen-oriented movies such as ""Abandon"" and ""Teaching Mrs. Tingle"". But in ""Pieces of April"" she shows that she can not only be the lead star in a movie, but excel in such a role. She will be an actress to be reckoned with in Hollywood if she keeps making such wise career decisions as this one, and avoids the trappings that most twentysomething actresses fall into. I could not imagine anyone else in this role, and her actions speak as loudly as her words in this movie, much to her credit.
Credit should also go to Derek Luke, who plays April's boyfriend Bobby, and the only real source of love in her life. This movie is all about the interaction of the characters, including the variety of neighbors that April must interact with when her stove breaks down, sending her into desperation mode. Sean Hayes of ""Will and Grace"" also makes an appearance, playing an extremely anil retentive man with a new stove. His performance is probably the weakest part of the movie, as he needed a little more direction that could have made him even creepier or stranger.
At only one hour and fifteen minutes, ""Pieces of April"" is very short, which is another reason to see it. It does not take much time, although you will feel as though you have been through a journey after watching it. As far as I'm concerned, this movie is a can't miss, and one of the best of the year to date.",1080518400,,2910,4.555343511450381
1957626,5,B0000VV4OK,"Why do Amazon reviewers have to blab away the plot of everything? All I can say is that this small, independent film by Peter Hedges is loads of fun, and full of idiotic, totally believable behavior from all involved. Katie Holmes is Miss Know-It-All, who doesn't. She's a riot. Derek Luke is not given enough credit in this film. He is the only one who is genuinely in love. The magnificent Patricia Clarkson is great, as well as Oliver Platt. Sean Hayes appears briefly, but his character doesn't seem appropriate for the seedy surroundings. Lots of fun; Holmes and Clarkson connect like magnets (opposites), and I enjoyed it a lot. Especially, Oliver Platt has never been in such control. This small film wasn't in theatres for long, but anyone who wants to go for an entertaining ride will enjoy it a lot.

1957627,4,B0000VV4OK,"You may have seen the famous Norman Rockwell painting, ""Freedom from Want"", which depicts the idealized American family gathered around the quintessential Thanksgiving table as the turkey is presented for carving. PIECES OF APRIL it's not.
April Burns (Katie Holmes) lives in a New York City apartment with her boyfriend Bobby (Derek Luke), and the film opens as the two begin to prepare Thanksgiving dinner for the rest of April's family, which is driving in from out of town for the ordeal.
Joy Burns (Patricia Clarkson) is dying of the metastatic cancer that has already cost her both her breasts, a surgical transformation suitably documented in the family photo album. She expects this Thanksgiving to be a disaster since daughter April was a more into drugs than Home Ec. Indeed, to say she and April are estranged is an understatement. But husband Jim (Oliver Platt) persuades her, so off they go in the station wagon with their other children, daughter Beth (Alison Pill) and son Timmy (John Gallagher), and Joy's senile mother Dottie (Alice Drummond) for what may well be Joy's last Thanksgiving.
In the meantime, as Bobby goes out on a mysterious errand, April is faced with a non-functional oven, which forces her to desperately beg the other tenants in the building for the necessary range time to cook the traditional bird. Time is running short, and the rest of the clan is getting closer despite frequent stops for Joy to vomit from the nausea induced by her chemotherapy. And it also appears that the family doesn't know that April lives in a decrepit tenement in a graffiti-decorated slum, nor that Bobby is Black. The Burns festive occasion promises to make your dysfunctional Turkey Day look like a Martha Stewart showcase event in comparison.
Clarkson was deservedly nominated for, but didn't receive, an Oscar for this performance in a supporting role. She's more the ""star"" of PIECES OF APRIL than the ostensible lead, Holmes. The Bobby, Beth and Timmy characters are almost an unnecessary distraction. More interesting are April's neighbors which give her help, or not, especially the very strange Wayne (Sean Hayes) and the middle-age Afro-American couple, Evette (Lillias White) and Eugene (Isiah Whitlock). There's an especially good scene involving Evette's initial reaction to April when the latter first appears seeking help for her culinary crisis.
The movie's abrupt conclusion after eighty-one minutes leaves much to be desired. One wonders if the scriptwriter ran out of ideas or the producers out of money. But there's still enough there to make the film more than worth the cost of the rental. And, next Thanksgiving with the relatives, perhaps you won't take those mashed potatoes for granted.",1079740800,23,2729,5.10738255033557

Ive never been a big fan of Katie Holmes, but she is great as a bit grungy, passionate and real April, far cry form her days on Davson's Creek, where her rolling eyes and immature faces were annoying. She gives a great performance, alongside of Patricia Clarkson, her cancer ridden mother.

1957631,5,B0000VV4OK,"Every now and again, a bright young person with a passion for writing and cinema, comes up with an original idea, often loaded with a personal input and background, writes a brilliant script, and secures limited finances to adapt his/her 'labor of love' to the big screen, after signing some known and excellent actors, who are keen to encourage new talent on one hand, and to do something different on the other. Peter Hedges is such a person, and his personal 'labor of love' is this underrated little gem of a movie, Pieces of April.
This movie really did blow my mind, and is one of the best I have seen in a long while, more so since I had no expectations at all, having only the faintest idea about it, a somehow  misleading one, since it is labeled as a 'quirky comedy'.
Not only was Pieces of April anything but a 'quirky comedy', it is a film with its simplicity yet equally deep themes, that have touched me greatly.
Filmed with a digital camera,the dreamy almost 70s mood, enhances the whole atmosphere of the film, and removes any unnecessary gloss.
An estranged daughter living in New York with a new boyfriend in a squalid flat prepares a Thanksgiving meal for her family. Her oven does not work, so she struggles to borrow her neighbor's ovens (a collection of eccentrics) to finish a 'perfect meal' before her parents, mother, father, grandmother, brother and sister arrive.
At the same time, the traveling family journey becomes one down memory lane, with all its happy and tragic moments.
It seems simple enough, but there is much more:
The mother has cancer, and it will probably be the last Thanksgiving she will have with her family.
At this point (and having a personal experience with this malign disease) I can say that I have yet to see a film that portrays the physical and emotional effect that cancer has on its sufferer so well without too much explanations or dialog, and with NO sentimentality!! It was very powerfully written and filmed albeit tragic.
The mother we feel is still the rock that every member of her family leans on for support, a role that she now finds as a sort of a burden, which increases her feelings of guilt and desperation.
Of course, the daughter manages at the end to finish her meal, due to the kindness of a Chinese family, and after some hesitation and soul searching, her family finally arrives and with a series of snapshots to commemorate this event, the film ends with a message of hope and reconciliation.
As much it is Peter Hedges's film (his first feature after writing the screenplays for What's eating Gilbert Grape, Map of the World and About a Boy) it is also Patricia Clarkson's film!
As the possibly dying mother, she is responsible for lifting Pieces of April from a sweet independent film to the powerhouse that it turned out to be..
All other actors are very good, especially Oliver Platt and Katie Holmes who I believe is not only a very beautiful woman, but with the right roles, can make very good films (and finally forget the debacle of Teaching Mrs Tingle).
Sean Hayes, who is one of my favorite comedians, has a short role as an eccentric neighbor with a brand new oven. His performance was good, but I am afraid he should be careful not to be typecast in these sort of performances and I expected more from him.
What works so well in favor of the film is its length, just under 80 minutes, it does not dwell too much on the before or after, but rather concentrates on the present which in itself with the dinner and the journey is enough to give us the glimpses that we need to sympathize and connect with the characters, and to be totally engaged in their story. (the only other film that comes to my mind where its length contributed to its success was the 80 minutes Patrice Leconte's Monsieur Hire)
So as I mentioned Pieces of April is not a comedy, but a  drama lightened up with a gentle humor, a film about love, bonding, reaching out, and most importantly it is about personal and collective HEALING..A must see film that you should definitely add to your collection.",1078963200,,4060,4.5832187070151305
1957638,4,B0000VV4OK,"April Burns decides to invite her estranged family to her new apartment in New York's Lower East Side to enjoy a homemade Thanksgiving meal and to meet her new boyfriend, Bobby.  Problems start to crop up, though, as her stove breaks down and she must hunt through her apartment building (on Thanksgiving Day) to find a stove that works.  Jim and Joy Burns have problems of their own, with their other two children trying to convince them not to go to April's and the whole family struggling with Joy's terminal illness and their feelings regarding April.
Writer/Director Peter Hedges has crafted a quirky and uniquely charming film, with more of a home movie look to it.  At times, this detracts from the film because a few of the shots are unsteady.  The cast is wonderful, with Katie Holmes as April, Oliver Platt as Jim Burns, the wonderful Alice Drummond as Grandma Dottie, and Derek Luke as Bobby.  Patricia Clarkson is fantastic as Joy Burns, juggling her feelings toward her estranged daughter with her terminal illness and her family's treatment of her.  Also making a fine appearance is Sean Hayes as Wayne, the man with the new stove who lives in 5D.  The cast works very well together, bringing home the message that family means togetherness no matter what.
The DVD contains both the Full-Screen and Widescreen versions of the film along with audio commentary and a nice ""Making Of"" featurette.  The movie had me both laughing and near tears toward the end, and just left me with a good feeling.  It's definitely a charming film.",1078963200,2,1542,4.788679245283019
1957639,5,B0000VV4OK,"Pieces of April is a movie about bonding and family relationships. On a thanksgiving day, April Burns was cooking a meal for her family in her apartment with her boyfriend (who happened to be an African American). Her mother, Joy Burns (Patricia Clarkson) had breast cancer and it was probably her last thanksgiving in her life. Therefore, the whole family drove all the way to New York to meet the once-rebellious daughter. On the trip, the whole family had to overcome their prejudgement of the daughter and accepted the fact that they were going for the (faking of) reconciliation among different family memebers. April, however, found that her stove did not work at all. She ran to every door to seek help inside the building. She met the African-American couple who told her that nobody liked canned food and advised to her go for home-made. She met a strange, meticulous, gay-looking neighbour called Wayne, who only helped her half-bake the stuffed turkey. She finally sought help from a Chinese family who did not speak English at all.
Piece of April not only brings family members together, but also people who live next to you, but you seldom know their names. People of different races, cultures or backgrounds are no longer in alienation. Choices and decisions and forgiveness bind them all together in the ending scene. The movie is short, but absolutely well-made. The dialogues are witty and highly symbolic. Peter Hedges did a fantastic job in writing the screenplay. The cinematography and editing certainly help create an experimental but true-to-life mood for the audience. Pieces of April is absolutely a surprise for the audience. I thought of comparing this movie to Thirteen (another movie that came up last year about a rebellious daughter and her mother), but in fact, I found the subtlties in the dialogues in Pieces of April are more powerful than simply showing everything naked in the big screen.",1078876800,2,1925,4.9813664596273295
1957640,5,B0000VV4OK,"Katie Holmes stars in the comedy ""Pieces of April"".  It uniquely combines drama and comedy brilliantly.  The writers prove that they know where to place the substances.  It contains lots of unique humor that is rarely used in other films.  Most of it comes unexpectedly, which keeps audiences' eyes wide open for every second.  As the struggles increase, the intensity increases.  The two story lines combine as one movie greatly: April struggling to create the perfect Thanksgiving get-together at her apartment and her estranged family traveling there with a lot of drama.  Though the film runs only seventy-four minutes, the cast and crew made perfect use of what they had.
Katie Holmes is wonderful in her role of April, which asides her from her previous works due to her wardrobe and her lifestyle.  She proves that she will stay in the spotlight for many more years.  Patricia Clarkson shines in her Oscar nominated role as April's mother, who's dying of cancer.  All other actors also perform their roles wonderfully: Oliver Platt, Sean Hayes, and more.  Everyone, including Holmes and Clarkson, offers their own sense of genre, which adds more flavor to the film.
""Pieces of April"" is a great film for those looking for a unique comedy.  This is sure to please many audiences for a long time.  The laughs will keep coming regardless amount of viewings.  They never get old.  This is one scene to anticipate:
April talking to a 911 operator: ""Hi!  I'd like to report a kidnapping.  There's a guy holding my turkey hostage.  My turkey....my turkey....my turkey.""",1078790400,,1569,4.946360153256705
1957641,1,B0000VV4OK,"I concur with another reviewer that this movie was not very good at all.  I was so bored and the cinematography was terrible, with unsteady cameras and the like.  It was a royal waste of my time and the only reason I kept watching was because I was SURE it was going to get better, but the only good thing was the snapshots at the end where her mother decides to come after all.",1078704000,3,378,4.094594594594595
1957642,5,B0000VV4OK,"April (Katie Holmes) is a young woman estranged from her family and living with her boyfriend Bobby (Derek Luke) in a mildly run down apartment building on Manhattan's Lower East Side. Aprils' mother, Joy (Patricia Clarkson), is being treated for advanced cancer and may not live long, so April has invited her family for Thanksgiving dinner in hopes of favorably impressing her mother and improving their relationship while there is still time. The family -Joy, father Jim (Oliver Platt), brother Timmy (John Gallagher, Jr.), and sister Beth, (Alison Pill)- piles in their car for the long and stressful trip to the city, while April prepares the meal. But things get off to a bad start when her oven won't work.

""Pieces of April"" was written and directed by Peter Hedges. It's a wonderful examination of family and an engaging portrait of these individuals who are so disparate in personality yet linked to one another by hope and tradition. And ""Pieces of April"" is an testament to the opportunities modern technologies provide to filmmakers with few resources. The film was shot in 16 days on digital video for $300,000. And, incredibly, the only glaring evidence  of these limitations is the absence of wide-angle shots. Director Peter Hedges didn't use wide shots because they are problematic on DV. The result is that occasionally our field of view seems unnaturally truncated, but not enough to detract from the quality of the film.

I was a little surprised to learn that great thespians Patricia Clarkson and Oliver Platt and a young star like Katie Holmes would agree to such a low-budget production, but I imagine this fantastic script  captured their interest. Peter Hedges' dialogue is crisp and forceful, and his characterizations are interesting and so genuine that these people might be your neighbors. Great actors, a great script, and resourceful direction can apparently create a terrific film with very little else. There is little I can say about Patricia Clarkson's performance except that she is brilliant as always. April's mother, Joy, is hypercritical, blunt, but a font of emotional strength, and no one could play this memorable character better. Oliver Platt departs from the quirky characters for which he is famous to play Jim, Joy's even-tempered tolerant husband. The supporting cast is large and perfect without exception: Alison Pill, who plays April's teenaged sister Beth, is destined to be a great character actress. Derek Luke, of ""Antwone Fisher"" fame, this time plays a man who is confident and comfortable with himself. All of April's neighbors are portrayed vividly, but especially memorable are Isiah Whitlock, Jr. and Lillias White as Eugene & Evette and Sean Hayes as nutty neighbor Wayne.

""Pieces of April"" is an engaging, ultimately optimistic, family drama that is somehow both idiosyncratic and universally true. Great performances. Great script. This is the best Thanksgiving movie I've seen. I can't recommend it more highly.

The DVD: There are 2 unavoidable previews. Both widescreen and full screen formats are on the same disc! Bonus features include a ""making of "" documentary entitled ""All the Pieces Together"", an audio commentary by writer/director Peter Hedges, and a theatrical trailer. The documentary includes interviews with the film's cast and Peter Hedges, in which he discusses the film's genesis. Hedges also does a nice audio commentary in which he talks about the film's themes, story, and technical stuff. If you really like the film, the extras are worth watching. Hedges' commentary may be of particular interest to aspiring filmmakers seeking insight into how to get the most out of a small budget. At the very least it is inspiring on that level.",1078185600,60,3725,5.158940397350993
1957643,4,B0000VV4OK,"A common theme in a movie about Thanksgiving is for the prodigal to return to the bosom of their family; if you just show up at Christmas you have to bring presents for everybody, but if you come home for Turkey Day you get fed the big meal with all the trimmings.  ""Pieces of April"" turns the common theme upside down because April Burns (Katie Holmes), the black sheep of the Burns clan, has invited her family to the Lower East Side apartment in New York City to have Thanksgiving dinner.  So April's Mom (Patricia Clarkson), Dad (Oliver Platt), Sister (Alison Pill), Brother (John Gallagher, Jr.) and Grandma (Alice Drummond), all get into the family station wagon and head for the big bad city (but after stopping at Krispy Kremes to make sure they do not starve to death).
Writer-director Peter Hedges alternates between the two halves of the story as April tries to find somebody in her apartment building who has a working stove she can borrow to cook her turkey (not to mention the things she has stuffed into the bird), while her family tries to make it without imploding along the way.  April's sister takes every opportunity to point out there is still time to turn around while her father insists it could be possible to have a good time.  Apparently no one in the car can think of one good memory about April and the only reason they are even bothering with this attempt is because it could well be the last time they will all be together.
April's mother has cancer and Patricia Clarkson, in her Oscar nominated role, gives a textbook example of how less can be more.  Her key moment in the film, taking place in a ladies room, does not even require her to speak a world, but she also has some moments of desperate humor that make her family despair.  The film is dedicated to the memory of Carole Hedges, the writer-director's mother and since Peter Hedges tells us his mother loved every day it is clear Clarkson's character must be a different person (but I could believe the brother is the director).  Still it is her journey that is more central to the heart of the film that April's attempt to get the turkey cooked.  This is captured in the film's ""before"" and ""after"" pictures, taken by her brother.
There is a sub-plot involving April's new boyfriend, Bobby (Derek Luke of ""Antwone Fisher"") that seems to serve no other purpose that to get him out of the house so that April is left to fend with the neighbors she finds behind the few doors in the apartment building that will open to her.  It is only when she tries to explain this weird American holiday to someone else that she remembers what it is supposed to mean to her as well and the memories of what her tart tongued mother had said on Thanksgiving pasts can be forgiven.  Holmes really has little to do in this film besides be frazzled and anxious, which is fine, because Clarkson is more than equal to the task of doing the heavy lifting in ""Pieces of April.""",1077926400,16,2943,4.5046904315197

Last year after suffering through the idiotic film ""HULK"", I almost gave up on movies period. But then I discovered some truly wonderful films like Sofia Coppola's ""LOST IN TRANSLATION"", John Sayles's ""CASA DE LOS BABYS"", ""THE STATION AGENT"", ""THE COOLER"" and this truly wonderful film! These films really refreshed me and gave me renewed faith in the film biz.
""PIECES OF APRIL"" deals with the life of a very dysfunctional family on Thanksgiving. I don't want to discuss the plot at length, for I feel it is best to discover the beauties of this film on your own. Suffice to say, the performances are first rate with Patricia Clarkson being a delight in her Oscar nominated performance as Joy, the mother of the clan. And the writing is fantastic. Hedges creates some truly human and believable characters and the film really hits home. The ending is very moving.
The DVD is quite nice. Picture and sound is great and the special features include a 15 minute ""behind-the-scenes"" look at the film, plus an insightful audio commentary with the writer/ director Peter Hedges. Among the many interesting nuggets of info is the fact that this film was shot in 16 days! Incredible! Also included is the theatrical trailer for this film as well as ""CASA DE LOS BABYS"" and several other current MGM titles on VHS and DVD.

April, Katie Holmes, has neighbors help her when oven doesn't work and meets a variety of people, which often leads to funny situations.  April and her family do not really talk because, as stated earlier, she is the odd child.
This movie had its really funny parts but it is a movie that will make you cry at the end.

1957647,5,B0000VV4OK,"PIECES OF APRIL, written and directed by Peter Hedges, is simply a stunning little movie.  Hedges has found the quintessential dysfunctional family and manages to make us love every looney one of them.  The method of back and forth story telling - parents and children preparing for and driving into Manhattan for their estranged daughter's Thanksgiving coupled with the concurrent Manhattan set of the preparation of that dinner - works incredibly well without detracting from the momentum and flow of the story development.
April Burns (Katie Holmes) lives in the seediest part of New York City and is the daughter who rebelled from her rather nutty family: she is tattooed, pierced, weirdly dressed, living in a rat hole tenement with her African American boyfriend Bobby (Derek Luke).  Never having cooked before, she invites her crazy family to Thanksgiving dinner (despite the fact that her oven is broken, she knows nothing about preparing a turkey, etc).  Her preparations are aided by at least some of her fellow apartment dwellers.  Meanwhile, her mother Joy (Patricia Clarkson, in a hallmark performance) who has had bilateral mastectomies for cancer and is on chemo + pot + bulimia + has a history of being slightly mad, her sweet flummox father Jim (Oliver Platt) who tries desperately to hold his family together, her 'just perfect sister' Beth (Alison Pill), her adolescent photographer brother Timmy (John Gallagher, Jr) and her senile but sweet grandmother (Alice Drummond) are all under duress at the thought of visiting April for the eating holiday.  The way this all comes together is one of the funniest, saddest, and most tender and insightful stories to come out in a long time.  The way Hedges treats cancer, senility, sibling rivalry, lost child syndrome, multiethnic questions, and family fragility is nothing short of genius.  This is a superb metaphor for alienation, acceptance, compassion, and mutual respect.  Recommended without reservation.",1077667200,15,1973,5.25796178343949

8004012,4,B0000VV4OK,"I have always loved Katie Holmes (except during her Tom Cruise years; we'll not speak of that) and she does a great job, along with Patricia Clarkson and Oliver Platt, in this low-budget but overall very good movie about a prodigal daughter who wants to make peace with her family, and particularly her mother, since her mother has cancer and this could very well be her last Thanksgiving. There are enough comic moments to keep the movie from getting too maudlin and enough poignant moments to bring a tear to the viewer's eyes. It's not something I would watch as a feel-good Thanksgiving movie. In fact, April would actually be a good time to watch it. Just about as far from Thanksgiving as you can get.",1512864000,,707,4.619047619047619
8004013,4,B0000VV4OK,"This was somewhat downbeat and overly long, but the cast is excellent and the ending well-worth waiting for. I wouldn't call it a keeper or a holiday classic, but it was worth watching once. It isn't a movie you would watch with children, mostly because they wouldn't ""get it"" and would probably be bored.",1511568000,,305,4.666666666666667
8004014,5,B0000VV4OK,"How did this film slip by my Thanksgiving, or just regular viewing, radar?  Along with Planes Trains and Automobiles this film absolutely MADE our Thanksgiving holiday weekend.",1511481600,,176,5.518518518518518
