3744298,3,B001P9N944,"This is a rewarding and unusual entry into the After Dark repetoire, and I promise that a few who watch it will avoid mirrors for a while.

Gina (Lena Headly) is a London radiologist with a close-knit family, loving boyfriend and a rewarding career. Yet right from the opening credits things seem subtly off-kilter. Gloom abounds. Creepy people pop up on the Underground and despite the closeness of relationships there is a sense of isolation and lonliness in the lead characters, especially Gina's father (Richard Jenkins) who, though obviously adored by his children, lives alone in a scary dark house. While during a dinner for his birthday a large mirror inexplicibly shatters, setting in motion a sequence of bizarre events and a moody pace that doesn't allow a person to really relax.

I know other reviewers will say this movie is slow. It is, but that slowness in at times unbearably tense. It feels like it's all happening in real time and you're just waiting for the other shoe to drop. Soon after the birthday dinner Gina begins to see a woman who looks just like her out of the corner of her eye. After a horrifying head-on collison and recovery her life really starts to get strange. Her once loving boyfriend is distant and mechanical. She only remembers fragments of the accident and the events leading up to it. She becomes convinced that her boyfriend has been replaced by a doppleganger (a nod to another wonderful horror film, ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers) and is terrifyed that her own ""twin"" is trying to kill her. Meanwhile, her brother, father and sister-in-law all seem to be affected the same way. And it isn't confined to the family: One of her brother's neighbors confides that his wife ""isn't his wife anymore.""

The ending is a bit unsatisfying, but I disagree that the plot is unsubstantial. In fact it's one of the best thought out films the Horrorfest has produced. An added treat is that it barely relies on violence and gore at all (although there is a doozy of a scene about half-way through.) Most of the characters spend time looking in mirrors so we see more of the actors' reflections rather than the actors themselves. And when those mirrors shatter we know awful things are crawling out from behind them. But what are they? Are they dimensional creatures looking for a way in? Spirits of the dead? Even worse, are they us, our darker halves? Is it possible that when we stare out our own reflections that something is staring back?

All I know is I spent two days avoiding mirrors. And I'll never look into one quite the same way again.",1244246400,3,2581,4.70353982300885
3744299,3,B001P9N944,"The movie has its own style, nice and moody.  It seems the director took the minimalistic approach.  Scenes are full of almost still shots and ambient tune is very minimal.  Even the characters talk in low tone, when they do that is.

The climax of the movie is near the very end and you get only a few hints, again closer to the end.  Other than that you are just watching Gina looking for answers. No action or scary moment in the movie at all. Not even a regular jumping cat or something, just couple of mirrors, that's it.

Although I liked the idea, which is revealed at the end, I didn't quite get why, or to what end? The ending explains what happens with/to Gina, yes, but it certainly certainly doesn't concludes the story. Good as it is, but it could have been a lot better.

3744301,5,B001P9N944,"I'll open with a warning: as fond as I am of ""The Broken,"" I suspect few others will share my enthusiasm. Lots will like it, a few will hate it (particularly the ending), but it is so tailored towards my not always conventional horror movie ideals that few will admire it the way I do. Also, my nonexistent expectations probably colored my response a bit. (I've watched it twice now and enjoyed it no less the second time, but the initial impression can last even in later viewings.) So consider this a caveat for my readers, if any.

""The Broken"" is perhaps the most praised entry in the years After Dark Film Festival set (faint praise, no doubt), and is a brief, extremely stylish and moody exercise in low-key horror. Make no mistake, those looking for visceral horror will be met with lengthy, near silent scenes where the disturbed protagonists wanders about the empty apartment, trying to understand her peculiar situation. (The moments of overt horror are effective, but rare, though perhaps too melodramatic for some tastes.) The tactics are drawn straight from the moody horror handbook: blue filter, rain, strangely empty streets, slow, creeping camera movements, rumbling music, ominously symbolic imagery (broken glass) etc. That said, the execution is remarkably adroit, and director Ellis maintains are air of uncertainty all throughout the film. (The performances are also solid, though not much is expected of them.) The film plays as something of a cross between Invasion of the Body Snatchers (doppelgangers, paranoia issues) and The Ring (the visuals, emphasis on mood), and manages to combine the two approaches so as to avoid redundancy. Many will still accuse it of being a rip-off of something or other, but that's usually a lazy, non-analytic criticism. Most genre pics just recycle the tropes--that's what they're supposed to do, for the most part.

The story is simple: one night a grown family living in London meet for a pleasant birthday dinner for the father, though one interrupted by the ominous shattering of a large mirror sitting opposite the dinner table. The daughter Gina (Lena Headey) soon finds her life has gone awry, as she, the next day, spots a mysterious, identical woman driving along the road. Gina follows her to an apartment containing apparent emblems from her life (a photo of her (?) and her father (?)) then drives off distraught, only to crash her jeep and land in the hospital. She cannot remember the details of her crash, though she is upset by the memory of her double, and comes to believe that the now strangely cold and distant Stephan is not her boyfriend. Even worse, the plague of doubles appears to spread throughout the city, as observed by other family members.

The story is, again, minimal, though it uses themes I particularly like, and I enjoy how it refuses to explain or contextualize itself excessively. It's like the best horror short stories, where we just slip through the real world and into an eerie variant where terrors lurk. (A mirror shatters, and suddenly nothing is the same anymore.) This is perhaps my favorite sort of horror, and no film I've seen in recent memory evokes it better than ""The Broken."" Some, however, will view it as all mood and no payoff, and that's a position I can respect, if not agree with. (Its being a scant 83 minutes, minus the credits, helps on this front.)

It is, however, impossible to fully consider ""The Broken"" w/o mentioning the ending. In short, I think it works, but I need to go into more detail, particularly to explain to those who've seen the film and didn't like it why I did appreciate it. Those who do not want the ending revealed should skip this paragraph. Last chance to move on . . . Okay, now that we've gotten rid of the others, here goes: It is finally revealed that who we believe is Gina through most of the pic is, in fact, her doppelganger. When Gina entered the apartment (her own apartment) the double kills her and drives off. She crashes, though, and loses her recent memories, along with having her personality temporarily altered by the bruising. This is a somewhat contrived conclusion, but I love one aspect: it refuses to sellout the premise of the movie. In films like these, it always turns out that the protagonist was delusional in some way, thus negating the supernatural. Ellis plays up this angle, leads us down the path and then inverts it: the main character is delusional, but in a way that reinforces the supernatural reality of the film, rather than subverting it. Thus, though a bit contrived, it works beautifully on a kind of metafictional level. Perhaps more to the point, the endings in these films are rarely inspired; the films should be about the mood generated by the mystery, not the solution. Those who are angered by it should remember this, and reflect on how hackneyed and obvious the revelatory endings to all the other mysterious horror pics they've seen were.

Anyway, this was a very pleasant surprise. Even those who disagree on the effectiveness of the ending should be able to appreciate the moody, paranoid ambience of the rest, provided they admire that kind of thing. Check it out.

3744302,2,B001P9N944,"Lena Headey and Richard Jenkins are great in this film. The bad and odd part is the movie ends without explanation. It is about mysterious beings that are possessing people's bodies. All of this filmed very realistically. The theme and setting are good, the plot builds, but then it's as if the producers ran out of money and ended the show. This movie will be forgotten. Too bad. It really had potential. At the least the viewer deserves an answer even if it is flimsy, difficult to recommend this one.",1239321600,2,503,4.6
3744303,3,B001P9N944,"A cross between Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Mirrors, The Broken is one of the more interesting films in this year's After Dark Horrorfest lineup, and probably one of the best as well.  That doesn't so much commend The Broken as much as it condemns a majority of the rest of the lineup, but what The Broken accomplishes in terms of style and a sense of dread makes up for its lapses in its story and the overall somewhat confusing nature of the whole thing.  Lena Headey (300, Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles) stars as Gina, who believes she is seeing a duplicate of herself before and after she's in a bad car crash.  Effecting everyone from her boyfriend (Melvil Poupaud), who doesn't seem as if he's the same man, to her family (including Richard Jenkins as her father), something seems to be very, very wrong here.  While it crosses elements of the aforementioned films in the beginning of this review, The Broken doesn't do much to explain exactly what's going on.  This works both to the film's advantage, while also detracts from it as well.  The film is also pretty slow moving as well, which isn't a good thing.  Flaws aside though, The Broken still manages to provide a healthy amount of shocks, scares, and escalating suspense to hold your interest.  All in all, The Broken is one of the more interesting, and better, films in this year's After Dark Horrorfest lineup, and in that respect alone, is worth checking out.",1239148800,2,1443,4.675889328063241
3744304,3,B001P9N944,"I've seen all the past installments of ""After Dark Horror Fest"" ever since its inception, most of them weren't really that impressive so I decided not to watch 2008's horror outings. However, being a fan of sexy Lena Headey (300, ""Sarah Connor Chronicles"") I decided to check out ""The Broken"". Written/directed by Sean Ellis, the film explores certain aspects such as ""existentialism"" and delves into the mystery of doppelgangers. It also opens up with a quote from Edgar Allan Poe, and it pretty much sums up the film completely.

Gina (Lena Heady) is a young woman who works as a radiologist. One day, she spies upon a woman who looks exactly like her, driving her car, that leads her to follow the woman to an apartment, then a car accident. Gina seems to have lost most of her memory of the accident, with bits and pieces just showing up in her dreams and finds it a challenge to piece together what happened during and after that accident. Now, strange things begin to occur, and things don't seem right--her boyfriend doesn't seem like her boyfriend at all and she keeps on getting re-occurring nightmares. Everything felt out of place. Gina now undertakes a journey to find out the truth...

""The Broken"" borrows elements from other horror films such as ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" and ""Mirrors"", but doesn't rely heavily on special effects. I would have to say that the film's main draw would have to be its gloomy atmosphere, mood and the great camerawork that emulates classic horror films. The cinematography by Angus Hudson is quite enthralling, not in the way that it generates scares but in the manner of which it manages to wrap you up in the proceedings. The film is focused mainly on Gina McVey and her journey through this mystery. The direction is competent enough to keep the viewer interested despite its slow-moving pace. The dialogue is restrained so that the viewer can take in the details through hints by its visuals.

I have mixed feelings about the plot that fleshes out certain devices that have been explored numerous times before. There are certain existential themes laid out but certain elements aren't fully fleshed out. I love methodical cinema so believe me, I am not the type who only appreciates spoon-fed details. The film doesn't answer the why's and the how's, the most important thing is what exactly are these doppelgangers? I know the mirrors signify reflections of one's personality, so a broken mirror is the harbinger of doom? So let's say that these elements were intentionally left unexplored, after all, this is a sort of a supernatural film, so maybe it is acceptable and better than a weak explanation so long as it does lay down the necessary groundwork? Well, it does in some ways, but the twist is very predictable which sort of ruined the impact on its narrative.

To its credit the film does have its share of creepy and grisly imagery. The scenes with the ""dreams"" with Stephan (Gina's boyfriend) altering his features to a demonic face is a good exercise in generating the protagonist's fears and confusion. There is just something ominous when someone drools that much while having sex with a woman. The shadowy foreboding imagery with Gina's dad (played by Richard Jenkins) is reminiscent of a classic horror film and you just know that the worst is about to happen. I enjoyed the scenes with Michelle Duncan in the shower as she confronted her own personal doppelganger--having an arm shoved down one's mouth adds for some visceral impact.

Lena Headey is good in the lead role, she genuinely looked convincing as the confused, paranoid Gina McVey. Much of her character is restrained but she makes the most of whatever she had to work with, which is mostly a reactionary role. Robert Jenkins is also quite good and feels very real to his role as a father who shouldered the responsibility of a raising a family in a foreign land. A large part of me wanted the film to flesh out the supporting characters, and the fact that this mystery isn't just happening to this family was hinted at but never fully developed.

""The Broken"" isn't a film for those looking for a fast-paced visually stunning horror feature and honestly, it may bore some viewers. It does attempt to pull off a cerebral experience and for that, I was thankful that it managed to avoid a certain perfunctory style so common in mainstream Hollywood horror. Certain elements in its composition are quite nice and it does have an unsettling feel. The film is a decent diversion but I really wanted to learn more about the doppelgangers and the parallel dimensions they may have come from, and their motivations; in this manner, the twist wouldn't have felt like a forced throw-away detail. This film had something nice and particularly special but sadly it didn't achieve it all--it came a little short of becoming a real success.

Recommended with caution, Rent it first. [3+ Stars]",1239062400,6,4914,4.822064056939502
3744305,4,B001P9N944,"I thought this little British flim was brilliant. At first I thought it was going to be rubbish. Wasnt a big fan of Lena H whats her name as I thought she was really wooden in 300 however she kinda redeemed herself in this little low budget film

If youve read any Kafka or Philip K Dick or know their themes you would pretty much get this movie straightaway. Its about how everyone's doppelganger who resides in a mirror world comes out to take the real person's identity instead.

I likened it to Kafka because at the beginning when the lead female character is convinced her boyf's wierd, you get this horrid eerie feeling that everyones in on it including the psychiatric staff as they monitor leaving the building. the streets of london are eerily quiet, theres hardly any people. the people in the building where her brother lives is slowly taken over by these doppelgangers too (the chinese man and his 'odd' wife)

The P K Dick feel kicks in when you realise that well.. i won't spoil it for you .....

I too was disappointed that there was no neat ending, it was all too openended, it was as if the director hadnt thought about how to end it at all or just to leave it rather hopeless which doesnt work too well in a film, cos this aint Bladerunner...

The cinematography was excellent amazing camera angles, it really was a work of art well done, im not normally scared having watched horror since i was 10 but this was brilliant. esp liked the little homage scenes to other horror films re - obligatory death shower scene haha and the wide window shots amde me think of that certain lamplit scene from the exorcist...

Nice i will look out for other stuff this director has done!",1238198400,5,1690,4.470779220779221
3744306,3,B001P9N944,"Watching ""The Broken"" is like playing an endless game of Clue without ever finding out who killed Mr. Boddy. It's a mystery without a solution, a tense psychological drama that reveals nothing other than how tense and psychological it is. It plays mind games only with itself, leaving the audience to watch from the sidelines in a bored, confused stupor. The idea behind it is intriguing, and for a time, it successfully builds itself up. The thing is, the act of building is pointless if there's no height requirement. At a certain point, it becomes painfully clear that the story will only keep building without ever reaching anything. I do give it credit for creating the right atmosphere; the characters inhabit a moody, subdued world where nothing seems safe, not even a person's own home. But atmosphere can only go so far, even in a horror film. It also needs an understandable story with an ending that doesn't leave us with more questions than answers.

It doesn't help that ""The Broken"" is unbearably slow, and this is despite the relatively short running time of eighty-eight minutes. Specific shots are dragged out so long that I eventually stopped waiting for something shocking to happen. It works only the first few times, at which point I kept in mind that suspense is most effective when things go slowly. After those few times pass, however, the film comes dangerously close to being boring, moments of horror and all. This is probably because it does a fine job showing us what happens, but it does a terrible job explaining why or how it's happening. By the end of the film, I was unable to make heads or tails of what I had just seen. What a shame, especially since it opens on such a promising note.

The film begins by quoting the final lines of Edgar Allen Poe's short story ""William Wilson"": ""You have conquered, and I yield. Yet, henceforward art thou also dead--dead to the World, to Heaven and to Hope! In me didst thou exist--and, in my death, see by this image, which is thine own, how utterly thou hast murdered thyself."" The story, you see, explores the theme of the doppelganger, or the double, where the self is divided amongst two separate yet identical bodies. In Poe's story, another William Wilson--who looks similar and shares the same birthday--continuously haunts the protagonist to the point of insanity. The same theme exists in ""The Broken,"" which tells the story of Gina McVey (Lena Headey), a British radiologist who, after seeing a clone of herself, gets into a serious car accident. As she recovers, she begins to fear that things aren't quite right, that her French boyfriend, Stephan (Melvil Poupaud), isn't the person he once was.

From here, the story takes a long-winded journey through strange territory, where mirrors constantly shatter and fragmented bits of memory keep flashing on the screen. Gina keeps trying to make sense of the crash, and apparently, so is writer/director Sean Ellis, who constantly shows it in slow-motion replays from various angles. He also relies greatly on composer Guy Farley, whose score is almost entirely made up of dissonant crescendos. It creates a mood, but what good is mood without context? Scary things keep happening, yet there's no explanation for any of it, which tells me one of two things: Either this movie is an experimental art piece that intentionally challenges rational thought, or Ellis was so taken by the psychological themes that he neglected to focus on an actual plot. It's difficult to believe that it's the former, given the fact that Gina is not the only character with a doppelganger problem. Her American father (Richard Jenkins), her brother (Asier Newman), and her brother's wife (Michelle Duncan) are all affected in some way, probably because of a scene early in the film--when the entire family eats dinner at the father's house, a large mirror in the dining room suddenly falls over and shatters.

For the sake of argument, let us say that ""The Broken"" is intended to challenge rational thought. Are we to assume, then, that the plot itself is irrelevant, that we're only supposed to follow the psychological implications? If that's the case, then there's no better example of it than a plot twist near the end of the film, which, if you choose to interpret it metaphorically, effectively raises questions about which side of a mirror represents the reflection.

But again, the fact that more than one character has a doppelganger makes the idea difficult to accept. How could such a broad psychological concept apply to so many people? Maybe this film would have worked had it focused entirely on Gina, because at least then the mystery would be much less open to interpretation. There would be some sense that the story is actually reaching for something. When you have multiple characters with evil doubles of themselves, the symbolic ideas are bound to get hopelessly confused with one another. Such is the problem with ""The Broken,"" a film that puts too many characters into a needlessly enigmatic story. I have no doubt that Ellis is trying to get at something, but for the life of me, I haven't a clue what it is. The only thing I got out of it, aside from the atmosphere, was a desire to reread the works of Edgar Allen Poe. So maybe seeing this film wasn't such a bad idea after all.",1231718400,22,5314,4.822368421052632
3744317,4,B001P9N944,"<strong>The Broken</strong> (Sean Ellis, 2008)

Ellis follows up the quirky, fun rom-com <em>Cashback</em> with something decidedly different, an atmospheric horror tale that mixes equal parts John Caprenter's <em>Prince of Darkness</em> and Phil Kaufmann's '78 rendition of <em>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</em>, adding a dash of David Cronenberg's <em>Crash</em> for good measure. Not surprisingly, that's a winning combination. More surprising is that Ellis managed to pull off such an accomplished horror flick in his first stab at the genre.

Plot: we open with a radiologist, Gina McVey (<em>A Game of Thrones</em>' Lena Headey), planning a surprise birthday party for her father John (<em>Let Me In</em>'s Richard Jenkins). Also attending: her brother Daniel (<em>Shem</em>'s Asier Newman), Gina's boyfriend Stefan (<em>The Lover</em>'s Melvil Poupaud), and Daniel's girlfriend Kate (<em>Atonement</em>'s Michelle Duncan). During dinner, a mirror shatters in the dining room unexpectedly. All well and good, no harm no foul. The next day, however, Gina sees a woman on the street who looks exactly like her. Not in the folk-wisdom way, but down to the hairstyle, clothes she's wearing, the lot. Unsettled by this, she finds herself distracted while driving home and gets into an accident that lands her in the hospital, her memory fragmented. She remembers nothing of the accident, as well as nothing for some period of time before that (we find out at one point she does not remember the birthday party, but before that, it's left vague--intentionally, I think). A psychiatrist friend of her boss, Dr. Zachman (<em>Adam's Apples</em>' Ulrich Thomsen), tries to help her regain her memories, which turns out to be a more urgent matter than anyone thinks. You see, all the sudden Stefan looks like Stefan, talks like Stefan, but Gina is convinced he no longer <em>is</em> Stefan...

It all seems pretty straightforward (as long as you remember that Ellis knows what he's doing: there's a reason the movie doesn't start with the accident, and that reason is that we are <em>supposed</em> to have more complete knowledge of what's going on than Gina does), but every once in a while Ellis will throw one of those curve balls that changes your entire perspective...as long as you're paying attention. Without being spoilery about it, did you catch the seemingly inconsequential scene between Daniel and his upstairs neighbor, Henry (<em>The Wyvern Mystery</em>'s Lobo Chan)? Blink and you miss it, but that scene changes <em>the entire movie</em>. It's a mark of Ellis' scriptwriting prowess that even if you don't catch the scene, the movie is still an enjoyable thriller; this just adds an extra depth and a little more punch. The downside to this is that you're bound to be kind of confused come the climax. I'm still not sure I've worked out quite how everything fits together, but I trust Ellis enough to know what looked like major plotholes weren't, and it will take some reflection, and probably some discussion with others, to figure out exactly how the pieces fit together at the end. But make no mistake, that's a good thing--it will keep you thinking, and talking, about this movie long after you've forgotten the latest Hollywood three-hundred-million-dollar-budget blockbuster. *** ",1332979200,,3301,5.318007662835249

The Broken goes with an unsettling, psychological paranoia, rather than your typical American slasher. I won't bother going over the plot, as other reviews surely do; having read other reviews of this flick left me with questions about what they expected from it. Many complained about the lack of explanation for the bizarre doppelg&auml;nger effect going around the protagonist's life, when the main point of psychological thrillers is what isn't explained. That's what makes the experience so unsettling. And anyway, if they've seen Sean Ellis' work, before, they might know that it's his style to blur the line between reality and imaginative fantasy (or in this case, lethal paranoia). I'm a little disappointed in the lack of special features, but that's not at all surprising, considering how few even know about this film.

Some truly creepy scenes, some incredibly well-done nail-biting suspense sequences, exquisite yet not overly-showy cinematography, highly effective use of locations, nerve-wracking subversion of the everyday into the macabre, and solid if not outstanding performances. I found myself somewhat frustrated with the lack of at least a little explaantion of what was going on, especially towards the end. THE SIXTH SENSE this is not, folks. Resolutions are far from neat. Also, the paranoia could have been mined and focused further. However, for something unusual which still pays off in the gore-n-violence department, this is definately worth a look. At times, it even comes close to echoing the ""no one believes her"" chills of the original STEPFORD WIVES, ROSEMARY'S BABY and the 70'S version of INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS.

The film is 93 minutes long and it could have been executed (probably should have been) in 30 minutes as an episode of the classic ""Twilight Zone"" TV series.  It's a yawner.  What a disappointment.  If this is what we can expect from a potential Horrorfest IV series, then don't hold your breath.  I rank this 5 on the Amazon rating system...for the slowest moving horror film of all time.  I guess it's a psycho thriller...but it's a great film to turn on at midday and take a nap to.  You could watch 15 minutes of it...snooze for an hour...and not miss anything in the last 18 minutes.  Avoid this.  The Horrorfest people should be ashamed.  They've damaged their reputation!",1262390400,3,753,4.552238805970149
3744330,3,B001P9N944,"My reaction to the After Dark series has been typical of most viewers posting here: a few intriguing installments and a number of ho-hum offerings. My approach to horror leans towards the cerebral and The Broken, along with The Deaths of Ian Stone, have been the most satisfying for my eyes and taste. Viewers who want to snuggle up to a chain saw or feast with cannibals won't be attracted to this one at all.

Having said this, here's what we have. A cozy family living in London begins to experience a series of unfortunate events characterized by mirrors breaking and the appearance (around town) of chilly, aloof replicas of themselves. It's Lena Headey's 'other half' that is the focus of the movie. Shot in steely bluish tones on overcast days, the film is an atmospheric ride highlighting the interaction of the good and evil twins. There are few moments of gore, but the directors set up some good surprises along the way. As a viewer, you'll be waiting for the next shoe to drop, and it you're willing to be patient, The Broken has its rewards.

The downside is a feeling of incompleteness. The film does come to a reasonable conclusion in the form of a watershed in the characters' interactions, but it's one of those moments that has you anticipating the ""to be continued....' frame. There's obviously more for a good story .... who knows, perhaps a followup is planned. We might learn why this family was targeted for these visitations, and whether every human has an unpleasant companion: if so, what triggers a visit from the creepy side of the mirror?

A major disappointment is the lack of any extras relevant to the film. The cast and directors have talent and I would have liked to see more in the form of a 'making of' or interviews. Had there been some more beef in this department, I might have pushed this up to 4 stars.",1259366400,3,1843,4.612804878048781
3744331,3,B001P9N944,"In The Broken Gina McVey's (Lena Headey) life is turned upside down one day as she is walking down a busy London street and sees herself drive by in an SUV.  Was she imagining it?  Was it just a look-alike?  Her curiosity gets the better of her as she follows the SUV to a nearby apartment complex.  Trailing the woman, she is stunned to see a framed picture of her and her father inside the mystery woman's apartment.  She flees, not paying attention to her surroundings and ends up crashing her car.  When Gina tells people what she's seen, her doctors think she is suffering the effects of a head injury and refer her to a psychiatrist.

Gina desperately attempts to piece together her fragmented memory of the events leading up to the crash.  Broken mirrors in her home, and that of her family portend something much more sinister than merely the stress of an accident.  Gina finds that her boyfriend Stephan seems changed.  He's cold and distant towards her and a drip from the bathroom ceiling causes Gina to search the attic where she makes a horrifying discovery.

The Broken straddles the fence between psychological and supernatural horror.  Writer/Director Shawn Ellis wants to perhaps use the broken mirrors as a mere metaphor symbolizing the shattered relationships of this family.  This was all set-up by an uncomfortable surprise birthday party for Gina's father, John, in which the family's sentiments seemed strained.  The party was, in fact, drawn to an abrupt close by a mirror that crashed to the floor.

Ellis drags out the pretense far longer than he should have, however before revealing The Broken's true plot twist.  It is derivative of 2008's Mirrors with Keifer Sutherland, and in some respects does a better job than that bigger budgeted film.  Unfortunately what Ellis doesn't give us is any sense of payoff.  We finally know what's going on but we don't know why.  Mirrors gave viewers a reason and a motivation for its supernatural threat, but Ellis doesn't want to make the leap here.  He seems to think it's witty to leave us guessing but I suspect he simply wasn't sure which direction he wanted to go with the plot.  In the end it's like waiting in a long line for a roller coaster which has no thrills.  It's kind of a shame because had he stuck to either the psychological or supernatural completely It would have been a better film.  The attempt to go for both, especially in such a short film (92 minutes) leaves both elements wanting.

On the plus side, the cast in The Broken is the best of any of this year's After Dark Horrorfest films.  We have Lena Headey from  Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, Richard Jenkins who was nominated for an Oscar as Best Actor this year, and veteran French actor Melvil Poupaud.  In fact the quality of the cast is surprising considering the generally low-budgets of the Horrorfest films.

Another positive is the score by Guy Farley which sets a brooding and suspenseful tone and peaks at just the right moments without trying to tease the viewer with false threats.  The Broken is one of the better of this year's After Dark Horrorfest films but you can't help but think it could have been so much better.",1258588800,2,3189,4.716094032549729
3744332,3,B001P9N944,"Well, maybe it wasn't that bad, but that was the longest -90 minutes that I've had to sit through for a long time.  Others here have waxed on about the atmospheric tension and symbolic imagery, and a few have happily given the ending away.  Go ahead and read them, since it will save you precious time you will never get back.  I did thoroughly enjoy the poignant ending, and the movie gets an extra star for actually surprising me since I didn't quite see that ending coming.  I'm not bothered by the ""why"" aspect of the film; there's no need for that to be answered when murderous dopplegangers are out to get you, but I would like to know just where do they expect to put those bodies.  Hmm?  Eventually someone in the lower levels of government is going to get vexed over piles of rotting corpses.

I did find two scenes to be particularly scary, and rewound them and forced the Significant Other to watch them, since he appears to be plagued with, among other things, a mirror phobia.  The dark moving shadow on the ""other side"" of the mirror reminds me of that wonderful episode of ""Lost in Space"" where Penny ends up finding a boy who lives on the other side of mirrors and she tries to rescue him from that world.  Ahem.  Anyway.  This really wasn't as good as an episode of ""Lost in Space,"" since it draaaaaaaagggged on and on and on with these long scenes of nothing that continually prompted the S.O. to enquire, ""Is it over?  I don't hear anything...is the movie over?  That wasn't long.  Oh, it's not over!  It looks like it's over.  Is this another movie?""

No, it's not another movie, although comparisons to ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" pretty much nail it.  While munching a cheap pizza on the couch (since nothing will ever pull me away from even a bad horror film) I decided that this would have made an excellent 30 minute ""Twilight Zone"" episode, and I'll bet it would have been a favorite episode, too.  But it's not a 30 minute episode, and unless you can see it for free, you shouldn't spend your time or money on this film.",1255824000,,2052,4.438502673796791
3744333,4,B001P9N944,"Gina McVey is beside herself, literally!  In this slow-paced creeper, Lena Headey plays a woman who one day sees another woman who looks exactly like her driving her car.  Shortly after confronting her, Gina is involved in a car wreck, and afterwards cannot remember if what she saw was real, or simply a result of a mental lapse from the wreck.  Soon, she cannot even be sure if the people around her are who they say they are.

THE BROKEN is one of the very few high end movies of this year's 8 Films To Die For.  The presence of recognizable actors such as Richard Jenkins and 300's Lena Headey add definite polish in the performance category.  The cinematography is excellent, expertly creating a moody and eerie atmosphere.  The style and pace of the film bring to mind M. Night Shyamalan, and the creeping under-the-surface paranoia of J-horror films such as PULSE.

Pacing, however, does prove to be the film's one weakness.  At first, the slow momentum seems to be building to something great - lots of slow camera moves, long shots of characters looking forlornly in those spooky mirrors.  This creates a very unnerving feeling . . . for awhile.  Unfortunately, after about 30 minutes, I started losing patience and wanted to start getting somewhere!  The film has an interesting story to tell, but it isn't a very complicated one.  As such, it is pretty clear to see where things are headed, and unless you are pretty slow, there isn't really much of a twist to it.  As such, I think this would have worked much better as a short film.  The action could easily have been confined to a 30-minute running time.

Another issue that some people may have is there is no explanation for the events of the film.  You will have a clear understanding of WHAT happened, but not WHY it happens.  As I thought about it later, I think an explanation would have only weakened the overall film - too many movies force-feed the audience an explanation that generally weakens the impact.  Here, something awful happens, and we don't know why, and that in itself becomes part of the horror.  Personally, I don't have a problem with it, but some viewers might.

All told, this one ranks near the top of the pack, even with it's threadbare story.  Some of the moments, particularly near the end, will really crawl under your skin.  Very few of the films in this year's festival had any impact at all (other than annoyance) - but this one got to me.  I wish it had been fleshed out just a little more with better character development.

3744335,3,B001P9N944,"THE BROKEN is a film that is long on mood and atmosphere but short on logic and climax.  The plot is a combination of INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS and almost any movie by Hitchcock.  The problem is that these latter works used mood and a slow buildup of suspense to move toward a logical end.  Lena Headey is Gena, a radiologist who spends much of her time looking at the shattered bones in X-rays.  Shattering seems to take on a life as a motife.  For no apparent reason mirrors shatter numerous times.  Shards of glass are ubiquitous.  Director Sean Ellis may be trying to imply that THE BROKEN is not aiming to be a traditional film with a straight line plot that moves toward an understandable climax.  Perhaps he means it to be a work of metaphysics that is trying to say something about the world in which we live.  If that is so, then he has failed miserably.  I have no idea what is the metaphysical or allegorical underpinning.  What I do know is that Ellis keeps teasing the viewer with a non-stop series of scenes that individually are arresting but collectively go nowhere.

  One day, Gina sees a woman drive a car and who looks just like her.  A coincidence?  The world is full of doppelgangers, Gina follows her to this double's apartment only to find a picture of herself with her father.  She does not recognize the picture.  In a daze, she drives her car and has a head on collision with another vehicle.  When she wakes up in the hospital, she has little memory of the accident.  It is at this point that director Ellis keeps inserting multi-faceted roadblocks that seem to lead toward a plot that would rationalize the existence of a duplicate Gina.  But, Ellis complicates matters by involving other doubles as well.  Her boyfriend, her father, and her sister are all murdered to be replaced by lookalikes.  Why we do not know.  Her father is an ambassasor in London, Gina herself is a doctor, her boyfriend is an architect, her sister is a housewife, but all are otherwise unremarkable.  No one is a mad scientist nor has a job in cloning or genetics.  There is simply no logic to any of this.  Finally, (SPOILER)we learn that the Gina in the accident is the double--she has eliminated the original only to lose her memory.  The ending is a total copout.  What I took away from THE BROKEN is that when a film promises some logic to accomodate a series of intriguing premises but fails to deliver a controlling logic, then what gets broken is an implied covenant between director and viewer to respect the latter's intelligence as the former titillates that viewer with some really gothic subtexts.",1251590400,7,2621,4.588362068965517

8332678,4,B001P9N944,"A shattered mirror unleashes the evil doppelgangers of Gina and several other family members who look to replace them in 2008's THE BROKEN. Writer/director Sean Ellis has taken many cues from the Italian Giallo when it comes to developing suspense through the slow reveal. Gina's memory becomes as fractured as the broken mirror after a terrible car accident, leaving her to pick up the pieces as she becomes increasingly more suspicious of her friends and family. She continues to replay the accident over and over again in her mind until she comes face to face with the horrifying truth. THE BROKEN finds all the subtlety that Alexandre Aja's MIRRORS was missing, using the mirror motif far more effectively in a number of frightful scenes. Even the slower moments maintain interest thanks to the thick, oppressive mood and the well-rounded cast, led by Lena Headey. Ellis never feels the need to overexplain the supernatural elements of the plot, either, which lends a growing sense of mystery that is so often overlooked in modern film. This carefully-crafted thriller is sure to please fans of more traditional psychological horror entries like JACOB'S LADDER, SESSION 9, or THE INNOCENTS.

I don't know why but in someway it reminded me of Melancholia. As a psychotherapist I've always been interested in dopplegangers or the clinical word, autoscopy. Early in my education I read the Menninger papers on the topic. The movie is dead on a contagion of autoscopy with all the creepy scenarios. The lead actress i beautiful and icy.
