8285103,3,B001BWYT4O,"The subject is extremely important, but i didn't think this film did it justice. There is almost no backstory for any of the Angola 3 (a big disappointment), and i found it hard to follow in places (even tho i've done a lot of research on the Angola 3). It was actually a bit boring. I preferred ""Hard Time"" and ""Who Are the Angola 3""",1421452800,,334,4.153846153846154

8285105,5,B001BWYT4O,I've watched this twice since Herman Wallace's release on October 2nd and death on October 4th.  Powerful film with important historical context.  I clipped the audio of Herman reciting a poem he wrote for the KPFA Radio News on his memorial service and funeral.,1381708800,,262,4.931818181818182
8285106,1,B001BWYT4O,"This ""documentary"" was highly selective in the material chosen to represent and reinforce the producer's predetermined conclusions. Having been to Angola numerous times to visit inmates, it is obvious to me that the producers of this film have a very negative agenda that does not mirror the reality of today's Angola. Injustice exists, to be sure, but the vast conspiracy mentality is indefensible. Broad strokes were used to paint a very negative and false portrayal of the warden and the institution. A waste of time.",1290297600,,520,5.129411764705883
8285107,4,B001BWYT4O,"This documentary tells a complicated story of three prisoners and their plights in Louisiana prison.
Their stories are very complicated and much background detail is covered in this film.  It looks like some (or all of it) was shot before Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The film definitely shows extensive evidence of some kind of prison or government frame up to solve a brutal crime that happened behind prison walls. I would recommend this film for people interested in the Black Panther Party, the American prison system failures, and compelling biographies.",1229299200,3,558,5.2
8285108,5,B001BWYT4O,"First off, it is PM Press that is putting this out. This is a story that needs to be told, see it, show it to others, talk.
I think it is important that more people see the living history of the struggle. These are not just names in a book, mere statistics. These are real individuals in resistance.",1217894400,3,299,4.172413793103448
