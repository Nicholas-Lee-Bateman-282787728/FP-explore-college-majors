8185967,5,B000OP3BAM,He answers all of the tough questions here. An excellent treatise!,1472601600,,66,5.090909090909091
8185968,5,B000OP3BAM,"This has been a life-changing video!!  Like many others, I had believed there was ""science"" to evolution, but this shows how weak that data is and  how amazingly strong is the evidence for a 6 day creation.  I recommend WITHOUT reservation this video to everyone who speaks English!  Grace Ziem, MD",1461110400,2,298,4.784313725490196
8185969,5,B000OP3BAM,"I loved this. It's my favorite of all Dr. Hovinds products. There's so much good information and it has been very helpful. Be careful for certain comments such as ""A fan"" he keeps posting the same lies and two star rating on all of Dr. Hovinds products to get people to not watch them.",1459728000,2,285,4.296296296296297
8185970,5,B000OP3BAM,"This will be an offensive dvd to many, because it goes against everything we have been taught, and if this was all made by God, we might be held accountable for our choices. 'BUT' it's a lot easier to believe that this orderly system of our universe was created by an intelligent designer, and utterly ridiculous to entertain the idea that a great chaotic explosion caused this orderly system. Everything you study, botany, zoology, astronomy... all of it....is orderly, and amazing. It doesn't take a brain-washed Christian to see the magesty of the creation, and the magesty of the Creator.....just look up.",1238803200,6,609,4.980392156862745
8185971,5,B000OP3BAM,"What a great DVD!!! Giving scientific evidence to prove a literal six-day creation, Dr. Kent Hovind refutes evolution's proposition that the earth has evolved over billions of years. The first of seven in the seminar series, The Age of the Earth, uncovers the follies of the Big Bang theory as well as exposing the religious beliefs of evolution.

This DVD is actually Region 1 encoding! Works on my old and simple DVD player!",1180742400,5,426,4.835616438356165
