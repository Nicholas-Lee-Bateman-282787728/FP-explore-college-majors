8284794,4,B001BTODY8,"I purchased this DVD after watching the PBS version.  This is about people who knew Marcus Garvey personally, and them narrating their stories about their relationship with the man.  The people here are mostly from the British West Indies, and a few from the USA.  If you like History, you will like this.",1394755200,2,305,4.716981132075472
8284795,4,B001BTODY8,"This film was set in Jamaica & includes lots of scenes of Jamaican reggae music being played and danced to.  The Marcus Garvey bits are worthwhile, too.",1383004800,,152,4.62962962962963
8284796,1,B001BTODY8,"Garvey is an important man in our history.  However, much of what we have in print or video about him is very flawed.  This may be of some interest to his fans, but it really tells us very little about him.  If you do not know much of Garvey but want to learn, look elsewhere.",1353715200,2,276,3.981818181818182
8284797,5,B001BTODY8,This is a low budget presentation done by the people of Marcus Garvey's homeland Jamaica. It has a few Reggae songs performed by a group of Rastafarian musicians to a group of children at a Kingston school. Also some elderly members of the Universal Negro Improvement Association who worked with Garvey were interviewed. Anyone who truly loved Marcus Garvey and appreciated the changes that he brought about in the souls of Africans all over this earth should see this video. This is not for someone doing research on Marcus Garvey's movement because many things are not mentioned.,1342310400,2,581,5.0
8284798,1,B001BTODY8,"Wow! I did order and watch the PBS video on Marcus Garvey and thought that PBS did a good and honest job on him. I am an admirer to Mister Garvey. So then someone comments that PBS was bias and racist. Wow! ... Yeah, wow! All a person has to proclaim is racist to get the black vote. I'll not get into that.
Of the sixty minutes of footage (mostly interviews with people that I have no idea who they are), I could only endure ten minutes. Then I fast forward, and to my dismay, can expect the same throughout.
No. It was a terrible home spun video mostly of those boring interviews and videos of pictures found in books. Sorry that I cannot give a favorable review on this video, but I did buy it with hearty anticipation.",1341446400,,722,4.201438848920863
8284799,5,B001BTODY8,"Great Video. And If the Real Perspective to check out! Do not watch the Pbs Bias and rascist version put together to dismantle the hard work of our ancestors. This One was put together with love and appreciation for the sacrifices made by Marcus Garvey and Illustrates the MAgnitude of Strength this man Possesed to have Millions OF Africans Uniformed and organized ready to take actions towards a brighter future a MUSt see!
