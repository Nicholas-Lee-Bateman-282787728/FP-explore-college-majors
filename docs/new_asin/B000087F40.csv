Firstly, earlier reviews may refer to a cut to 110 min version , this current release is the full 191 min version.  That said, this is NOT a wuxia action movie and over 3 hours without a single martial arts battle may be well beyond the attention span of Asian action movie fans.
Having viewed the limited USA available releases of King Hu's deservedly acclaimed Touch of Zen, and IMO lesser, perhaps because of deplorable quality releases by alleged bootlegger Red Sun and mediocre Tai Seng, of Dragon Gate Inn, Raining in the Mountain, and Painted Skin, I consider this his  masterpiece. Briefly, cinematography is peerlessly magnificent and the plot engaged my rapt attention thruout, unlike rubber stamped revenge or obviously predictable outcomes flicks.

I would like to thank the beautiful and talented Ms. Hsu Feng (pronounced She Fung) for funding the 4k restoration enabling cinema fans to finally appreciate and enjoy the masterwork of director King Hu  and her prowess as a leading lady in many of his films. Altho I'm not much into ""extras"" analytical and historical commentary by competent critics were very informative.

This Kino Lorber release is decent, tho not quite Criterion quality. Looking forward to the Criterion restored Dragon Gate Inn coming up in July.",1525132800,3,1313,5.032258064516129
7979469,5,B000087F40,"The commonly seen version of this film is 110 min, and I'll give 4 stars for that version. There is a 180 min version of this film, and the 180 min version is as good as A Touch of Zen (in my opinion). King Hu's last work, Painted Skin (1993), is also a fabulous movie. Both Legend of the Mountain and Painted Skin derive from the 'chuanqi'(legend) genre of literature, while Painted Skin is much more entertaining. Viewers will be disappointed if they want to see King Hu's action scene in these two movies, since there are basically none. However, I think viewers will enjoy these movies very much if they have some understanding of Chinese philosophy.",1368057600,5,654,4.598290598290598
7979470,4,B000087F40,"In addition to viewers interested in King Hu's work, I believe 'Legend of the Mountain' may also appeal to those interested in classical Chinese/Asian literature and philosophy.  The film is reminiscent of the 'chuanqi' genre of popular narrative literature in Tang China and specifically the 'dream travel record'.  It follows the reality, dream, reality paradigm and like earlier works evolves in a linear fashion.

By placing the film in this context, there were many parallels to other works which I felt enhanced my understanding.  For example, the General's daughter in the film is named 'Cloud' and in Kuunmong, there is a character named 'Cloudlet'.  The clouds/mist present throughout many of the scenes in the movie (in addition to the character, Cloud, played by Sylvia Chang) seems to represent a blurring between reality and illusion.

Quite a few scenes show wispy clouds floating past the moon and call to mind a section in Francisca Cho Bantly's excellent book, Embracing Illusion:

'Transcending illusion is like the moon appearing after clouds are cleared.  It does not mean that the absence of clouds can be called the moon; instead, where there are no clouds, one can see the moon.  It does not mean that nonillusion is the real and unchanging truth; instead, where there is no illusion, one can find the truth.  In general, arising mind and moving thought (speaking falsehood and speaking the truth) are all illusions...[Taken from Mirror for Meditation Students by Hyujong]'

'This passage speaks of the need to lift the clouds of illusion in order to see the moon; but it paradoxically asserts that the moon itself does not represent a real and unchanging truth.  Both clouds and moon are interchangeable illusions, but it is still possible to speak of finding truth.'

While I would not necessarily categorize this film as good, it did stimulate my imagination.  Additionally, there are a few other things to be aware of before you purchase this film.

First, as reviewer, David Alston, already noted this film is really grainy.

Second, for those that need to rely on the subtitles, they are a little subpar.  The most common issue is one letter in a word being wrong.  For example, 'come' may be 'nome'.  I think most viewers can figure out the intent without too much effort, though.  Other than that, they generally seem to be an accurate reflection of what is being said.

Lastly, this is definitely a film of the '70s in terms of cinematography.  Although I haven't seen an episode in many years, I immediately saw similarities with the 1970s television series 'Kung Fu' with David Carradine.",1351296000,3,2622,4.993087557603687
7979471,4,B000087F40,"Having watched King Hu's major work such as Dragon Inn, A Touch of Zen, Raining in the Mountain, Legend in the Mountain, and a segment of 3 parts story, ""Big Wheel"" (?), I strongly believe that Raining in the Mountain is his best.  The ""Legend in the Mountain"" is its lesser sibling.  And, together with A Touch of Zen, I'd call them, loosely, King Hu's mythical martial arts trilogy.  A Touch of Zen is really original and certain scenes in it actually ""inspired"" Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"".  But, too bad, King Hu was limited by his geographical ""isolation"" (he's in Taiwan) and his background & training.  Were it not for factors as such, A Touch of Zen could very well be a ""perfect"" masterpiece.  One can clearly see King Hu's growing & ""improving"" in Raining in the Mountain.  But, it's not readily available to the public.  So, you settle for this ""Legend in the Mountain"".  Someone has to take the initiative to make all his films available to the public.",1278028800,6,979,4.645348837209302
7979472,3,B000087F40,"King Hu belongs to a dubious group of filmmakers: the neglected; alongside the likes of Satyajit Ray, Mikio Naruse, Youssef Chahine and Ritwik Ghatak.  As with all of those filmmakers, King Hu's work - when available at all (his legendary DRAGON INN is nearly impossible to find), is only available in dubious quality - fuzzy DVDs, cropped or pan-and-scan editions, VCDs, DVRs.

This is a shame - Hu's flair for history recalls Kenji Mizoguchi or Satyajit Ray, his personal and highly evolved spiritual ideas evoke Andrei Tarkovsky, and his flair for both landscape and action is reminiscent of Kurosawa or John Ford.

That noted, LEGEND OF THE MOUNTAIN - one of the handful of King Hu's films currently available - seems like lesser Hu.  I'd say 'seems like,' because it's companion film, RAINING IN THE MOUNTAIN (the two films are apparently interrelated) has been mostly unavailable on VHS or DVD, save for a Japanese DVD edition (no English subs) recently released.  Without seeing both, I'd guess that it would be difficult to evaluate in a thorough fashion.

Here we have a ghost story, heavily infused with Buddhist mysticism: a young, and rather earnest scholar (Hsu Feng, who also starred in Hu's extraordinary A TOUCH OF ZEN) retreats to semi-abandoned fortress in an isolated mountain range to study and translate an ancient sutra.  Upon arrival, he immediately encounters a small, but eclectic cast of locals; his encounters with them propel him into a series of intrigues that ultimately escalates into a good-vs-evil struggle.

The story recalls A TOUCH OF ZEN in its' ambitions and complexity, but compressed into the 110-minute running time here, the entire story (and the acting) feels a little forced, and a little rushed.  The cinematography (the film was shot on location in South Korea) seems to be dazzling, though currently available editions of the film are fairly grainy, and night scenes are very indistinct.  Hu's sense of action fails him here; the majority of it seems very half-hearted, compared to earlier films, and Hu's sense of slapstick (one gets the distinct impression that some commerical pressures may have intruded upon this film) threatens to overtake that more supernatural sides to the story.

That being said, the film STILL looks good, and manages to be entertaining - and there are a few set pieces here that are breathtaking, in spite of the flaws also evident here.  Perhaps for fans of Hu; but if you're one of those and you haven't seen this, you should.
