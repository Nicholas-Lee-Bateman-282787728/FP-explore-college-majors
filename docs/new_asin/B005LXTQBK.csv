4830775,4,B005LXTQBK,"A great subtle, somewhat dry and simple comedy that never takes itself seriously.  It follows a group of manure salesman in the 1960s who find themselves in competition with a ridiculously over the top company. This movie is certainly not one of the best movies I've seen but it is entertaining and a good one to pick up from the library or to watch on Netflix.

The acting is excellent, the cinematography is pleasantly artsy, the dialogue is non-stop manure puns with some alright other jokes and it's a good length for the kind of movie that it is. Billy Bob Thornton, Tea Leoni and Ed Helms are perfect leads. The soundtrack is pretty great. My only complaints is that it almost seems unorganized because so many weird and random things are happening all the time that sometimes it's hard to fully grasp why and what just happened.

Language is fairly clean, no sex, nudity or gore. Just a lot of poop jokes and strange events about a company trying to stay afloat and sell manure.",1361059200,2,985,4.5852272727272725
4830776,4,B005LXTQBK,"I saw this movie at someone's house and got such a kick out of it.  The unusual background, and very unique storyline.  We, all ages, enjoyed this movie and will watch it over and over.",1356912000,2,185,4.257142857142857
4830777,5,B005LXTQBK,"The production utilizes a brown surreal back drops for effect. All the salesmen drive identical brown Plymouths, apparently synonymous with crap. The beginning of the film is loaded with manure humor. Like real manure, after you have been around it for a while, you don't notice it. Mr. Rose dies and leaves the company to his city daughter Rosemary (Ta Leoni). The time frame is the mid 60's. She attempts to get the debt ridden company under control and rides with the salesmen of which Patrick Fitzpatrick (Billy Bob Thornton) is the best.

Things aren't going too well, then the bottom drops out when a rival company threatens to push them out of business, resulting in an unorthodox war between the companies. Meanwhile there is a mysterious man called Nose-tra-dameus or Nelly the Nose (Richard Edson) who visits the office.

The movie is clever, even without the manure humor. Ed Helms is his typical self while Pruitt Taylor Vince gives us his likeable big guy role. I loved the backdrops as every day had a brown hue overcast. My biggest negative was the anachronism of the Endangered Species Act (1973).

No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Fake man boobs. Frequent S-word usage, move over South park.",1336262400,6,1203,4.8585365853658535
4830778,4,B005LXTQBK,"I purchased this movie because my little brother is in the movie - he plays one of the ""enemy"" Manure salesmen.  The movie was quirky, but funny and the scene props were amazing!!",1332547200,4,179,4.424242424242424
4830779,2,B005LXTQBK,"This movie must have went straight to DVD. The owner of a company that sells manure passes and his daughter, played by Tea Leoni, steps in to run the company. There's a nice twist at the end but if you make it to the end you are well rested. The film is one poop joke after another. It's filmed well, shot on digital with a different look, and the music is good but it is a weird little film that drags. Definitely not a dvd anyone would want to own so if you're interested, rent it.",1329609600,,483,4.041666666666667

8478738,1,B005LXTQBK,"I didn't know the storyline when I bought The Smell of Success, I just decided to search for Tea Leoni movies and came across it.  For the price I suppose it's OK, but I wouldn't buy it again.  It's a story about... crap.  Literally.  She's an heiress to a manure business her father left her, but it's in debt big time.  The lines try to be quippy but the jokes are very corny.",1430611200,,378,4.123287671232877

8478741,2,B005LXTQBK,"The movie had a few funny scenes but basically it was just a quirky mess. What was up with the sepia tone backdrops?  I was hoping this would be a lot better with the likes of Billy Bob, Tea Leoni, Kyle MacLachlan (Ed Helms had one of the funnier roles) but it was almost like a comic version of Twin Peaks, except that was much better.  My recommendation is to skip this.",1390694400,,372,4.152777777777778
