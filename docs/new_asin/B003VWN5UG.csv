8407173,5,B003VWN5UG,"I am a new bee to jave ee and I like this gentle intro. I work with experienced stalwarts, still I like this tutorial! I have gone ahead and bought the Spring DVDs as well. Hope to buy the Glassfish one as well. Need I say more?

The gradual progression is really good. Online display of the actual complete code, how things fit together, why something was taught first, and to show later that life is not that painful when a framework is used, are very well done. I sometimes jump to view later chapters for a refresher, this always makes me feel how nicely I was brought to that place when I started this course.

I have access tons of code at work, this tutorial lets me understand their place and purpose.  Hats off! Hope to see more and more.",1342656000,,747,4.283687943262412
