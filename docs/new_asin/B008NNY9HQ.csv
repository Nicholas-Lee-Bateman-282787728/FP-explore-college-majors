5170890,5,B008NNY9HQ,"Tenchi Universe is not a sequel to the original Tenchi Muyo anime. It's more or less a reboot of the franchise. It would not be the only reboot they did as they did the same with the Tenchi in Tokyo series.

Universe still has the same concept as the original series though. Tenchi meets some strange women and wacky hijinks happen. Unlike the original series though, the story revovles more around Ayeka this time though. Which is fair because in the original series, Ryoko and Washu tended to have more of the story about them and their enemies. This series also marks the debut of fan-favorite Kiyone to the franchise.

She is Mihoshi's partner in the Galaxy Police, who just can't endure Mihoshi's problems...all she wants to be a top officer in the GXP, but with Mihoshi as her partner, that's near impossible.

The Main characters from the original series return but their stories have been tweaked. For example, in the original series the monster in the shrine was actually Ryoko. In Universe though, the monster is actually Washu. You still get to enjoy the antics of Tenchi, Ryoko, Ayaka, Mihoshi, Grandpa, Sasami, Ryo-Ohki, and the rest of the gang. Though the backstories for all the characters have been altered from the previous series.

The series still has the funny comedy the original had. In a way it's funnier than the original series. Some of the scences in the show are gut-splitting funny. It turns serious in the later half of the show, which the Tenchi series always does well.

It's double the length of the first show, you get 26 episodes as opposed to the 13 episode original series. Though it seems like a bit much, the story and characters never get tired or boring. It's a blast to watch from beginning to end. That's probably the best explanation as to how this series surpasses the original....there is just more of it. Also something else that helps is the fact that it has an ending. The original series ended on somewhat of a cliffhanger, which Universe does not. While the original series got an ending series years later, you don't have to buy 2 series to finish Universe.

The dub is still fantastic and still holds up well to this day. If you want to watch subbed that's fine, though if you watched the show on Toonami it'll be hard to watch without missing the dub.

The other good thing about this re-release is the fact that it is affordable. The Geneon release( which i own BTW)commanded near $200.00 for a USED copy. While it's plummeted with the Funimation release, you can still buy it at around $90.00. That's nice, but the re-release will only cost you about half that.

To me Universe is the best harem anime ever. Only the original series and some of the Tenchi movies are near this level of quality. If you want to see Tenchi at his best check out Universe.

Pros:
The story is great.
The voicetracks are still amazing.
It's still funny after all these years.
the animation still looks great.

+/- There is less sexual humor compared to the original series.
There is much less nudity than in the original series. Whether you like this or not depends on your point of view.

Cons: Some might not like the way the story jumps from funny to serious.

In the end. If you like Tenchi or want to get into the Tenchi franchise, this is the best anime to start with. Also it doesn't end after the series ends, the movies fall in after Universe. So you can continue the series after you finish Universe. If you come across someone who says there is no good harem anime, show them this series. You won't be disappointed.",1349827200,27,3561,4.590551181102362
5170891,5,B008NNY9HQ,"Tenchi Universe was the first series I ever bought on DVD. I saw the series on TV and decided I had to have it. Tenchi Universe has everything you could hope for in an anime. Great characters, comedy, romance, action and sci-fi adventure. Universe has a much more cohesive story line than the other seasons. Although the whole Tenchi series is good there are lots of holes in the plots. Universe makes more sense. The ending of this series is by far the best as well. You have got to watch Tenchi Universe.",1349481600,15,506,4.451612903225806
5170892,5,B008NNY9HQ,"Before the age of internet downloads, cable tv was just starting, and dvd's - the only way a person could have enjoyed anime was to go to stores like FYE (Camelot and Suncoast at the time) and Bestbuy and load up on overpriced VHS tapes - but there was some lights to the fledgling American Anime fans - these were Robotech, Star Blazers, Voltron, Sailor Moon (sorry but it is true), and TENCHI.

Poor Tenchi - he is a 16 year old earthling who lives with his father and grandfater who is a priest at a local shrine but his world is about to take a complete 180 when a spaceship lands in the lake that he is standing at and sees a cute, but drunk lady.  When she comes to, she says she is Ryoko, and an evil space pirate is pursuing her - then a giant suit of combat armor appears and attacks.  Soon the ""pirate"" is discovered to be everyones favorite ditzy detective Mihoshi and Ryoko is the evil space pirate.  This starts the story, and as Tenchi puts it the carnival that his life will take as other girls come into his life, the princesses Ayeka and Sasami, the mad scientist Washu (who is a genius, but things tend to blow up in her face), Kyone the GXP detective who has to put up with Mihoshi, and others who pop in and out.  But Tenchi has a destiny, and these girls are the key that will take him to other dimensions, and into space.

I first got into Tenchi by seeing the first movie (which actually takes place in this universe not the OVA's).  You can say he is the start to the harem comedy series that all others copy from.  A definate classic that anyone can enjoy with laughs, cringes and head shakes.  Enjoy!",1348876800,12,1626,4.236245954692556

5170912,5,B008NNY9HQ,"As other reviews have stated, this is the TV series for the very popular Tenchi Muyo! that aired back in 1995, dubbed 'Tenchi Universe' here in the US. As such, it's thematically very different from the two OVA collections for Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki that aired from 1992 to 1995 in Japan. Influenced heavily by OVA co-writer Naoko Hasegawa, the series is structured in a much more contained, orderly overall story arc from beginning to end.

Briefly covering some of the major differences, characters shift places: instead of Ryoko, it is Washu who is exiled and imprisoned on Earth near the Masaki home in Okayama, and is the lone polycentenarian of the cast, a consummate mid-scientist and tinkerer. The young Ryoko, no longer Washu's ""daughter"" of sorts, instead is actually portrayed as an infamous space pirate and bandit (unlike the vague allusions to it in the OVA) whose career only comes to an end when she and the Galaxy Police detective pursuing her, Mihoshi, take their fight to Earth. Princess Ayeka, a childhood acquaintance of Ryoko who is no longer related to Tenchi (having only known of the legendary Juraian prince Yosho by reputation, rather than being betrothed to him) answers her S-O-S, and soon fines herself on an indefinite vacation there as well. Sasami (still Ayeka's younger sister, and considerably more savvy and spunky in this appearance) does the same after failing to rescue her wayward sister.

After this, they're joined short order by Universe's most memorable original character and partner of Mihoshi, Detective Kiyone. An original creation of Hasegawa apparently, Kiyone's probably Tenchi Muyo's most successful breakout character (and far more popular then the similarly-named 'Granny' Kiyone of the OVA series), and appears in every version of the series except those based off the OVA, and it's not surprising when you see her in action with Mihoshi. Another memorable TV series addition is Nagi, a sort of anti-Ryoko with her own cabbit-spaceship who, while not a superhuman, still manages to be the universe's most famed bounty hunter (capable of kidnapping both Tenchi and defeating Ryoko in her first appearance). The series' Kagato also makes an appearance, towards the end, but is generally not as memorable or interesting as his counterpart at the end of the first OVA. Overall, the characters avoid the sort of convoluted, jumbled family tree that the series creator Masaki Kajishima eventually put into place in the OVAs and associated series (like the highly disappointing Tenchi Muyo GXP or the rather unusual Tenchi Muyo: War on Geminar), and the famed Tenchi harem itself is much smaller--Ryoko and Ayeka vie for his affections, but by and large, Sasami is more interested keeping the household together, Washu more interested in her experiments, Kiyone does not fall for Tenchi at all and Mihoshi much more emotionally attached to her partner than the young Earthling. Not surprisingly for a TV series versus an OVA, there's a lot less raunchy sexual humor as well, and the series has a higher emphasis on slapstick and situation comedy.

So that's the series. As for the DVD package itself, it's a very respectable transfer in an affordable boxset. My only complaint is that, unlike the high-production OVA series (including the rather disappointingly-animated third OVA), the TV series isn't available in a HD format in the United States, nor is it streamed in HD from Funimation, probably a reflection of its status as regular TV series. That isn't really the fault of this particular release, but the chances of getting a bluray release of Tenchi Universe seem very slim, at best. Visually, the series holds up respectably well, though it isn't the stunning visual treat that the first two OVAs are (though it is visually superior to the third OVA). The two Tenchi Universe! films, Tenchi Muyo In Love! and Tenchi Forever (sometimes called 'Tenchi Muyo In Love! 2') are available, as part of the three-film Tenchi movie collection (the film 'Daughter of Darkness', despite the appearance of Kiyone, is not related to the TV series).

Lack of HD aside, if it's your favorite take on Tenchi Muyo! or you just want to own the TV series, it's hard to argue for $20.00 US for 26 episodes. Definitely grab it if you're not subscribing to Funimation's streaming service (there is little, if any difference between the dubbed and subtitled versions they stream, and those two versions you can watch on these DVDs).",1436227200,3,4466,5.055630936227951

I'd like to be able to compare it to the original, but few companies bother to update old series onto DVD or Blu-Ray, which is sad.",1370476800,,430,4.597402597402597
5170958,5,B008NNY9HQ,Yup tenchi universe I grew up with it and been a long time and I had forgot so many great details. well worth going back down this path.,1369958400,,136,3.892857142857143
5170959,5,B008NNY9HQ,When DVDs were new this set cost about $200.00. Now I have the entire series for less than dinner for two at Olive Garden. Tech driven deflation is the best kind.,1369612800,,162,4.258064516129032
5170960,5,B008NNY9HQ,Tenchi Universe is still funny even today its a classic thats aged well. Video quality is great and the price can't be beat.,1367020800,,124,4.434782608695652

Bought for my wife cause she never seen it and now loves it.
i really have no complaints...overall happy customer.",1365120000,,132,4.541666666666667
5170962,4,B008NNY9HQ,I watched this series years ago and it's still the same way I remember it: funny and entertaining. The voice acting is a bit hit or miss in the first few episodes but you can tell how much it changes as it gets toward the middle and end. For it's time the animation is still pretty good too. I would recommend this to people who are first getting into anime.,1363737600,4,358,4.128571428571429
5170963,5,B008NNY9HQ,"So, this series revolves around a boy that becomes involved in a adventure that he is the key too, although, not at first.  One by one, the main body of characters filter in.  This is a fan service series, but wouldn't call it harem.  Not too many adult situations minus drinking and some minor obscenities, but you can see worse on daytime drama.  Each character has a back story that gets filled in, but also, you get to watch the growth of defining characteristics that existed.  The ditsy blonde just adds so much like Brittany is to Glee.",1361318400,,543,4.5
5170964,5,B008NNY9HQ,I finally got this to be apart of my collection.  I would recommend this to anyone who watched the original Tenchi Muyo OVA series to buy this.,1359936000,,143,4.296296296296297
5170965,4,B008NNY9HQ,There is something so relaxing about watching this anime. I sometimes use the subtitles if watching in English for clarification (hopefully). Even watching Ryoko and Ayeka fight over Tenchi's attention is fun. The other related series have alternate intros for Ryoko and Wasshu.,1359590400,4,278,5.488372093023256
5170966,3,B008NNY9HQ,I was not aware that there is more than 1 series of tenchi muyo. I bought this thinking it was the series i watched when i was a kid that i liked so much but it was actually something else. A little disapointed but its still good. Just another anime to add to the collection now.,1359331200,3,279,4.0
5170967,5,B008NNY9HQ,"Ive waited years for a re-release of the tenchi series' since the limited releases done by pioneer are hard to come by, often damaged and very expensive, so this set is a welcome addition to my collection. now im unsure if its an edited release or not as i never bothered to watch an uncut version but there were a few shots of fully nude Ayeka in the bath so im assuming this is an uncut version. Also for all you fans out there you may be a bit confused seeing as how the tenchi universe spans across several different story arcs and retellings, well you will be pleased to know that with this re release funimation was kind enough to put a  little chart on the back detailing which series are directly related to which and which ones are a different telling or spin offs, personally i found it very helpful seeing as how the original tenchi muyo! ovas are a different telling than tenchi universe or tenchi in Tokyo and i don't even know where exactly where gxp or the movies or magical sammy and everything else falls. All in all a great series, especially for us older otaku  that watched this show on cartoon network or even beforehand on vhs. It hasn't aged very well though, so unless you have some nostalgic ties to this show i wouldn't recommend it, for all you fans out there, what are you waiting for, time for a trip back to the original harem show so grab your popcorn and dig out your ryo-oki backpack. It's time for Tenchi ^_^",1358985600,,1442,4.356877323420075

5170970,4,B008NNY9HQ,Just to clear the air for those that don't know but this is not the main story line of Tenchi Muyo! but rather Tenchi Universe. For those of us that remember this show from the Toonami of the past this is certainly a nice nostalgic piece. The show itself is alright though is much better if you haven't seen the original Tenchi Muyo!,1356652800,,333,4.301587301587301

5170972,5,B008NNY9HQ,"I have waited for this for so long. Out of all the Tenchi stuff this one is my favorite. This show is the main reason I got into anime. It is nicely priced($35 at this time). It mixes drama, action, and comedy very well. I've seen it labeled as a harem anime but it isnt. It is more of a love triangle, most of the female charachters have no interst in Tenchi as a love interest. My only complaint is that this may be the worst Dub I have ever heard.",1351987200,,450,3.956043956043956

8529242,4,B008NNY9HQ,"What is it, is it a clone, is it a tie in or a dastardly cash grab?  Nope, its just more Tenchi.

This show is great fun, this outing was created by Hiroshi Negishi and was created in response to the origanal ova created by Masaki Kajishima and Hiroki Hayashi.  Not wanting another clone Hiroshi put his own spin on the show.  Not seen as true cannon as only what has branched off of the OVA is, its a fun show any way.  Each iteration brings its own flavor to the franchise.  The original Tenchi Muyo is a space opera with a more romantic feel to it, Tenchi Universe is a space adventure, finally Tenchi in Tokyo is nearly pure romance comedy.  What makes a fan enjoy any of these is purely based on what flavor you prefer.  I personally enjoyed the OVA and Universes best.  Tenchi Universe is a more compact series and because of that its a fun watch that you can really leave feeling content with.  The only factor that removed a star for this series for me was the characterizations.  The characters in the original OVA are spot on perfect, because of this it makes it a hard act to fallow. In Universe they do ok, how ever at times it seems like the Universe versions are trying to do impressions of the OVA versions and for me its something that takes it down a notch.",1525046400,,1274,4.266666666666667
