nudity was in films.  actors are some of bel-ami boys,they are cute
but not exciting in this format",1218412800,,154,4.310344827586207
7928716,3,B0000507PZ,"No plot. No talking. Just hot young Eastern European guys doing friendly (not competitive) wrestling in the nude. Don't buy this if you want anything more than that.

Quality is OK, but could have been done better. The first scene is in an indoor spa that's not very well lit. Plus the wrestling happens in waist high water so important things are covered up. The two scenes of on-the-floor grappling are best, they are well lit with good camera angles. The wrestling is good too, lots of action. The two stand-up scenes are awful, they are in darker locations, the camera zooms out too much, and the wrestling is kind of boring. In one scene the two guys just stand there with their arms locked around each other trying to lift the other off the ground. It looks like a strange dance, and it isn't visually appeling. When one guy manages to lift the other guy, he swings him a little then puts him back down gently.  The quality is up and down.",1171929600,6,945,4.456647398843931
