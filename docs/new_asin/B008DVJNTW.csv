5153466,4,B008DVJNTW,Buy this set for Blood Diner alone. It is hands down one of the funniest horror movies of the 1980's.,1359158400,,101,4.1
5153467,4,B008DVJNTW,"fido,sundown,boy eats girl and blood diner are killer movies! earth girls are easy and parents are worthless boring movies. but fido alone is worth the price of addmission!",1350518400,,172,5.178571428571429
5153468,5,B008DVJNTW,"I happened to stumble upon this DVD at local Walmart for $5.00! That is a great price for six movies. I'm surprised to find that Lionsgate released the unrated version of Bloody Diner instead of the R version.

The movies on this two discs set are:

Disc 1:

Bloody Diner (Unrated;1987; 88 minutes)
Earth Girls Are Easy (PG; 1988; 99 minutes)
Boy Eats Girl (R; 2005; 80 minutes)

Disc 2:

Parents (R; 1989; 81 minutes)
Sundown: The Vampire in Retreat (R; 1990; 104 minutes)
Fido (R; 2006; 92 minutes)",1349136000,32,500,4.573033707865169
5153469,5,B008DVJNTW,"Lionsgate has a tendency to release cut versions of films or horribly cropped ones. However I have to give them a huge thumbs up for releasing Blood Diner uncensored. First time available in the US if Im not mistaken. The movie itself is so jaw-droppingly bizarre I have a hard time describing it. If you like 80's cheese & your horror tinged with pitch-black humor definitely check out. It's cheap but far from boring. And like the last release of this set, it may go OOP sooner than you'd think.",1346976000,20,497,4.533333333333333
5153471,3,B008DVJNTW,I bought this for Parents. I ended up enjoying Fido as well. Boy Eats Girl is a good movie to be added.,1489017600,,103,3.727272727272727

5153479,5,B008DVJNTW,"I will say first off that i got this for Blood Diner and Blood Diner alone because it was substantially cheaper to get it this way than Diner as itself. That film there is a greatly underrated classic that is just a blood soaked laugh fest. Twisted dark humor,lots of blood and a crazy story. 2 brothers dig up their Uncle who was killed by the cops performing a ritual for a Sumerian Bloodfest. They dig up their uncle who tells em how to prepare the feast,and they dispose of the body parts they don't need by feeding em to all the people coming to their Vegan restaurant. That film aloe is worth 5stars. The other film i found hilarious in a dark way is Fido. About a world set in the 50s and the world is overrun by zombies,zombies people...domesticate thru Zomcon. That company puts shock collars on zombies to keep em in line,well that can only work for so long...a boy becomes friends with his zombie. Soon the wife falls for the zombie too,but the father is afraid of them because he had to kill his old man when the outbreak started. If you liked Sean of the Dead you will dig this,4 stars. The film Boy Eats Girl was another fun film about a boy who falls for a girl,who in a mistake of  sight sees her with another boy...so he kills himself. The boys mother takes pages from anancient book that brings him back from the dead,but he isn't alive fully. He gets a craving but contains it,with no memory of what he did..he confronts the school bully..then he turns. Soon thewhole town is swarming with flesh eating zombies. Another 1 you'll enjoy if you dig Sean of the Dead,Warm Bodies or even the oldschool My Boyfriends Back. 3 stars. Parents is another 50s-60s era film with Randy Quaid and Mary Beth Hurt starring in a cult classic about a normal looking family with a strange behaving son. The kid is traumatized by visions of his parents soaked in blood,the boy finds his dad is a scientist and is taking cadaver meat to feed his family. The boy acts out at school,the boy soon finds his suspicions of cannibal family are correct...so he kills em. 4 stars. The film Sundown i found to be rather funny and cool,a 90s film about 2 brothers who hate each other,1 who has family and 1 who is a vampire. Set in the west the family goes out to the remote town to create a synthetic blood to keep vampires alive without having to feast on humans and erase the food source. Starring Bruce Campbell and David Carradine and M Emmett Walsh in this vampire thriller. 3 1/2 stars,i will say 4 jjust cuz it surprised me and made me laugh...i was seriously impressed. The dumbest film which i got 12 minutes into cuz i got a headache was Earth Girls are Easy...i refuse to watch it,it is like a terribly written 80s space film loaded with cheese. 0 stars. The set alone is worth 5 stars for Blood Diner alone,Fido and Parents are the other 2 greats followed by Sundown and Boy Eats Girl. Get it and don't hesitate to get it.",1471219200,5,2923,4.383057090239411

This is a nice package of comedy/horror flicks (plus Earth Girls are Easy)  Randy Quaid, Bruce Campbell, David Carradine, Julie Brown, Damon Wayans, Jeff Goldblum, Jim Carrey and Genna Davis, plus lots more fun.  Parents has been a long time favorite and happy to get Sundown and Earth Girls at such a bargain price.

Having never seen Boy Eat Girl and Sundown prior to this collection, I'm happy these movies are included because they're great.  Parents is one movie I had to have and love it.  Earth Girls are Easy is just silly fun and Blood Diner is a hot serving of enjoyment.  You receive two discs and the picture for each movie is really quiet good.  If you're on the fence, you really should come on down and buy the movie.",1439856000,,484,4.333333333333333
5153505,3,B008DVJNTW,"This is an old horror movie collection. They are funny, stupid, and occasionally cause the body to jump.

5153511,5,B008DVJNTW,I bought this only for Blood Diner. So nice to have it on DVD!!!,1425513600,,64,3.642857142857143
5153512,4,B008DVJNTW,"Great buy. I purchased this just for Fido because it was cheaper than a standalone purchase & I figured 'why not?' Most of the films here are throwaways but if you ever have a Halloween party or a drive-in Grindhouse themed film night you could do much much worse. Fido comes with no subtitles nor extras which is sad but it's a brilliant, very much overlooked film that pays homage to not only the zombie genre but also excellent satires like Idiocracy. It's hilarious & well written, even endearing, & it's much more fleshed out than the Lassie spoof it appears to be. It gets 5 stars. Sundown is terrible, & not in that 'good' way, but it satisfy some people's craving for schlocky camp. 1 well-earned star. Earth Girls are Easy hasn't aged well but it's still funny & innovative enough to keep you smiling with some highly memorable scenes.  I wish Julie brown was still a name. 3 1/2 stars. Blood diner IS a bad good film, with a flimsy premise & stupid characters that get themselves into worse situations, & off course a 'killer' you're still supposed to be sympathetic to. 3 stars. Parents wasn't & still isn't my cup of tea is its brand of horror satire is very forced. It's a hoodwink film that says the whole time, 'I know that you know that I know ..' while playing up the unthinkable for both shocks & laughs. Still, Randy Quaid has always been severely underused & underrated. 3 stars. I haven't seen Boy Eats Girl, yet, saving it for a desperate night. A lot of (former) punk & emo kids swear by it though

Disclaimer: None of these films thus far have had any special options nor features. Be forewarned. This is a bare bones collection (ha ha, horror puns)",1424822400,5,1673,4.481967213114754

5153523,4,B008DVJNTW,"The caveat is that Lionsgate shows all these films in fullscreen. They also have a widescreen version of this collection, but good luck finding it. I bought it just to have the unrated version of BLOOD DINER. Lionsgate also crams three movies on one DVD, so the picture quality is not the best, but acceptable. I just wish Lionsgate would start treating their wide catalogue of older horror films with the respect they deserve, rather than dumping them in compilations like this.",1397952000,6,479,4.853658536585366
5153524,5,B008DVJNTW,First of all this movie spoofs the old H.G.Lewis gore classic Blood Feast. Add director Jackie Kong`s super funny sense of humor and a bunch of funny unknowns and enjoy the ride!!!Some people don`t seem to get the jist of this movie but others like myself are diehard cult followers. The picture quality is top notch and all for $5!Was even a little better than the German Dragon dvd release that I had years ago. Don`t go into this movie expecting to see something scarey or ultra-violent. Everything is done in a very funny way and you pretty much laugh your way through it beginning to end. Kudos to whoever had the sense to get this out for us diehard freaks. SHEETAR!!!!!!!!,1396828800,2,679,4.573770491803279

5153526,5,B008DVJNTW,"I love this pack so far!  I had seen Fido and Earth Girls are easy and liked them both (though I don't think Earth Girls really fits).  I've watched Sundown and Boy Eats Girl - more horror comedy.  Sundown was cheesy, campy fun.  I'll watch anything with Bruce Campbell.  Boy Eats Girl has a hot Irish male star and a decent zombie plot line - also lots of fun.  Neither take themselves seriously and were entertaining.  I'm looking forward to watching Parents and Blood Diner.",1391385600,,477,4.541176470588235
5153527,3,B008DVJNTW,"""Sundown"" and ""Fido"" are the the best out of the set. They've got a good mix of horror and humor and have a lot of great character actors in them.

""Earth Girls"" was okay, but it seemed to kind of drag on in parts. Geena Davis looked amazing in it, tho! ;)

""Boy Eats Girl"" was pretty much typical zombie shenanigans... nothing new, but a watchable film.

""Parents"" was so boring I nearly couldn't stand it. I didn't like Randy Quaid playing the jerk of a dad... he's way better as the clueless goofball like in the ""Vacation"" movies.

""Blood Diner"" was, by far, one of the worst movies I've ever seen... I really don't understand all the positive comments on the film. The acting was so bad I'd almost swear everybody was lip-syncing. Troma could have made a better film than this!

If you want to get this set, get it dirt cheap and maybe you won't feel so bad after watching it.",1390089600,,881,4.347560975609756
5153528,5,B008DVJNTW,"OK so it isn't really 6 horror movies- ""Earth Girls Are Easy"" is NOT horror in any way- it does show Jim Carrey and Damon Wayans pretty early on in their careers and Downtown Julie Brown singing ""Cause I'm a Blond""
...and ""Fido"" is a cult masterpiece with a great supporting cast including Tulsa's Tim Blake Nelson not to mention Carrie-Anne Moss and Billy Connolly doing great service to the story.
""Parents"" is an old favorite- button-down Eisenhower type family turns out to be VERY VERY dark indeed- hint is ""long pig"".
""Boy Eats Girl"" is an Irish horror/comedy and is better than some of the more stringent critics would have you believe- sort of like ""Warm Bodies"" in its theme and treatment- but the way Warm Bodies might have been without the millions they seemed to have had to play with.
The other movies are described admirably in the other comments",1389744000,9,860,4.6644736842105265
5153529,5,B008DVJNTW,"I bought this collection because of the rave reviews of ""Blood Diner"" (which I had never seen) and I was not disappointed.  I'm still laughing from the absurd, outrageous and hysterical hypermanic climactic scene - brilliant! Any horror film that can also make references to such comedic icons as the Marx Brothers and Mel Brooks and feature music as diverse as 'doo wop' and Richard Wagner is a true one-of-a-kind cinematic experience. The other wonderful movies that accompany it in this collection are a fantastic bonus. But ""Blood Diner"" rules!",1386460800,13,548,5.088888888888889

One of these days, I'll watch the other four, but I got this for 'Blood Diner' and 'Sundown: The Vampire in Retreat"". Blood Diner is just
splattergore fun and even more wonderfully bad than I remembered! Sundown is a rather clever humorous look at a peaceful Vampire
community led by a Vampire nobleman who just wants to get along with humans & dealing with a rebel faction who holds
that the Old Ways were better! Blood Diner has no one who ever became famous. Sundown has David Carradine, Bruce Campbell,
Morgan Brittany & other familiar but not majorly famous faces.",1376697600,,701,4.616

5153540,5,B008DVJNTW,"When I seen that Blood Diner was one of the movie in this series I had too buy it. Blood Diner is a classic comedy/horror from the late 80's. Two brothers George and Mike opens a vegetarian diner with the help of their uncle's brain, but the customers don't know is there's human meat in their food. George and Mike get their meat by killing topless cheerleaders, girls at the clubs, and lovers near a cave. But the main reason for the killing is not for the diner, but for a God name Shetar which is made of female parts. Blood Diner is a hardcore gore and nude films which is release unrated in this set.
