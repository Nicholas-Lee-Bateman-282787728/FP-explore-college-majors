8388284,3,B000Y39LBM,Good company to order from. They helped me with a dispute and offered to reimburse me for the DVD I purchased. After a few emails I decided to keep the DVD because the listing of the DVD was not their fault. It should have been listed as Animal Attraction III DVD. The 3 gave me the impression it was a three DVD set. $51.00 for one DVD threw me also. $51 for 3 DVD's was manageable. I don't like anyone enough to spend that kind of money for 1 DVD. The company satisfied me in its emails. I will use them again.,1289001600,,512,4.029411764705882
8388285,3,B000Y39LBM,"Not much point in watching this other than the soft core content.  The girls are attractive,  the guys are not.  The plot is almost nonexistant and has logical holes you could drive a truck through.  There is no doubt but that this was done on a low budget and the clarity and quality of the film image reminds me of something that might have been done in the late 1960's.  All of that being said,  if you are in the market for soft core that you can get for a bargain price this might be something you would want.  The girls are worth the cover charge.",1267401600,,553,4.160377358490566
