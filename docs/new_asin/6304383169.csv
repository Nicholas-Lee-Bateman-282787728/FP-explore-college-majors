854196,5,6304383169,"Few films can tug at the heart strings as well as I REMEMBER MAMA. Adapted from the John Van Druten play, which was itself taken from the Kathryn Forbes novel, I REMEMBER MAMA captures indelibly slices of time in the life of a Norwegian family living in San Francisco at the turn of the 19th century. Narrated by a grown up Katrin (Barbara Bel Geddes), the film combines the problems of adapting to life in the United States with solutions that seem unworkable to those still steeped in the ways of the Old Country. At the center is Mama(Irene Dunne), who orchestrates the lives of her large extended family. Irene Dunne is superb with her profound understanding of human nature. She shows in scene after scene that a matriarch must be flexible enough to account for and guide the divergent personalities of her family. For her sisters, Mama makes it clear that she will not permit them to bully her vulnerable children. For her children, she extends praise when it is needed and stoicism when that is needed too. And for the boarder who skips town without paying his owed rent, she resigns herself that he has paid in a different coin, that of reading the classics to her children, thus inculcating in them a love of words. Surrounding Irene Dunne is a group of superb supporting actors, all of whom add flavor to a film that is linked only by the memories of Katrin. Perhaps the most outstanding job is the one done by the non-paying boarder, Mr. Hyde (Cedric Hardwicke), who nightly regales the family with timeless tales narrated in his booming voice, the sum total of which is to create a story within a story with each passing tale. Although the years pass, no one seems to age, and that is all right since the segue from scene to scene is accomplished so seamlessly that the audience scarcely notices. Oscar Homolka as Uncle Chris hits just the right note as the blustery yet kindly man who hides his kindness beneath a pushy attitude. Interspersed through key scenes in the movie are the appearances of Katrin, who interrupts the narrative to talk directly to the audience, commenting like a subdued omniscient narrator on the plot. Again, rather than putting off the audience with a style of narration that in another film would surely be seen as intrusive, in I REMEMBER MAMA, Katrin's comments, as well as all the various strands of the film, are seen instead as welcome threads that unite what could have been an aimless, disjointed movie into a chronicle of a family that rings true with each passing scene. Not many movies can come close to accomplishing this. Homolka, Bel Gedddes, and Dunne were all nominated for Academy Awards. This is truly one of the most heart-warming films of all time.",1029283200,28,2708,4.6911764705882355
854197,5,6304383169,"No family should have to go without watching this film. It's the best family film ever made because it shows the normal struggles that a family goes through in everyday life and how they are able to overcome their problems. Irene Dunne is magnificent as Mama, earning her fifth Best Actress Oscar nomination. Oscar Homolka, Barbara Bel Geddes, and Ellen Corby are also brilliant in their roles. If you haven't purchased this classic now, then you better do it soon because a classic like this dosen't stay on the shelves for very long.

854198,5,6304383169,"The quote said by Katrin Hansen at the opening and at the closing of the film. This film about a poor Norwegian family living in San Francisco in the early twentieth century can make anyone laugh or cry as it contains a good deal of humor and some touching emotional scenes whether it is happy or sad. Irene Dunne certainly played a great role as Mama Marta Hansen, an immigrant from the ""Old Country"" (Norway) who moved to San Francisco with Papa Lars Hansen (Philip Dorn) where their four children were born.
A young Barbara Bel Geddes (of Miss Ellie Ewing fame) plays the eldest daughter Katrin who struggles to become a successful writer and decides to write about her Mama as well as many of her other family members including her loud and boisterous great-uncle Uncle Chris Halvorsen (Oskar Homolka), her three aunts Jenny, Sigrid, and Trine (Hope Landin, Edith Evanson, and Ellen Corby respectively), and her older brother Nels (Steve Brown) and her two younger sisters Christine and Dagmar(Peggy McIntyre and June Hedin), as well as her Papa. Edgar Bergen certainly had the right role as the timid funeral parlor director Peter Thrkelsen whom aunt Trina wanted to marry, and if anyone laughed she would ""yump in the bay!""
This video has the flavor that anyone of Norwegian descent would love to see and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys watching movies about family ties.",1022457600,5,1387,4.807531380753138

854200,5,6304383169,"Rites of passages in American families are a dying cultural icon that is well documented in this fictional tale of a Norweigan family growing up in San Francisco.  It may seem quaint that this family worries more about when they are going to be able to drink coffee than when they're going to get a new car in these cynical days, but the fact that this tight knit family sticks together even in the most dire circumstances shouldn't be lost in today's world.
See this movie for its humor, and its realistic viewpoint of family values.  The Norweigan accents may seem unrealistic, but like ""Fargo"" they are not.  They reflect the actual way people in the Scandanavian culture speak when moved only one generation from ""the old country.""
It has many of my favorite lines such as ""I'm going to go wash the dishes"" and ""We don't have to go to the bank"".
See this movie for the wonderfully detailed viewpoint of family life in the early 1900's, the beauty of the life of poverty (another subject I could go on and on about), and the impression of the life in a loving family.",997660800,11,1070,4.505154639175258

854315,5,6304383169,"Lovely piece of yesteryear. I first saw this film years ago on late night television. Irene Dunne was one of our most underrated actresses and it's difficult to believe she never won an Academy award. I feel she should have won for The Awful Truth, which proved she was as skillful a comedienne as a dramatic actress. She had such a warm presence in every film.  She made her last film in 1953 with It Grows on Trees, a minor piece of fluff, and decided to retire, but she left behind an awesome resume of films. I consider IRM the best dramatic role of her career, with Anna and the King of Siam and Life With Father just a shade behind.",1507680000,,638,4.2727272727272725

854538,5,6304383169,"I Remember Mama was one of the very best of Hollywood's Golden Age nostalgic films about family life. Yes, it's sweet, and innocent too, but it's not saccharine or idealized and deals with serious issues like childhood illness and death in the family. The family is the Hanson's, headed by Mama (Irene Dunne) and Papa (Philip Dorn) and their four children, Katrin, Nels,Christine and Dagmar. They are part of an extended family who all moved to San Francisco from Norway to keep themselves close to each other. Mama's rented house is at the top of Larkin Street with a view of the bay. They are headed by gruff Uncle Chris (Oskar Homolka), the three nieces, Jenny (who is bossy), Sigrid (who whines and complains) and Trina (a spinster suddenly about to be married) and little cousin Arne, Sigrid's boy.

The story is intricate and episodic but really draws you in after a while because it seems so real with genuine family issues and characters who are not all perfect and have their flaws. The ensemble cast is simply marvelous from the children to old Uncle Chris. Oskar Homolka recreated his stage role as the family patriarch in one of the best movie roles of his career. Edgar Bergen is absolutely unrecognizable as shy Mr. Thorkelson, and Florence Bates makes a memorable appearance as a noted author who loves good food. Then, of course there's Irene Dunne in one of the best roles in her career and one of the five for which she achieved an academy award nomination (she was known as ""the best actress who never won an Academy Award). Originally a dramatic actress known for films like Back Street and Love Affair, she switched gears to become one of the best comic actresses with Theodora Goes Wild, The Awful Truth and my Favorite Wife. with her usual dedication she studied several months with a Norwegian teacher to get the accent right. The result is a note-perfect performance from beginning to end.

The title may sound a bit cloying and even the DVD cover looks a little too sentimental, but this is a truly fine movie that those who like classic films and really, anyone else should enjoy. Give it a chance.

EXTRA NOTE ON MARLON BRANDO: A lot of fuss is made about the fact that Marlon Brando played the son, Nels, in the original stage production, one of his first roles. Many people have said he should have gotten the movie role as well. But I disagree with that idea. If Brando was in it his presence might have become the main thing the film would be known for. His presence would overshadow everything else and we would never see Nels, we'd see Brando. I think the unknown Steve Brown made a perfect Nels and blended in with the ensemble cast without creating undue attention to himself. And really, he looks a lot more Norwegian than Marlon Brando.",1483747200,4,2774,4.6456211812627295

The story-line, the life of a Norwegian immigrant family in San Francisco struggling to make ends meet, as their meager earnings are portioned out weekly to avoid ""going to the bank"", is beautifully played out by Irene Dunne, Barbara Bel Geddes, and Oscar Holmolka.  The friction between the seemingly harsh ""Uncle Chris"" and three nieces keeps the overall plot interesting to the end, when family perception of Uncle Chris is surprisingly changed as he is found to have been a generous benefactor.  ""The bank"" proves to have been an invention of Mama (wonderful portrayal by irene Dunne) to keep the children from suffering the stress of a lack of money.

Parents, despite the objections your children may have of ""black and white"" films, this is a movie to be highly recommended.  Perhaps it should be given five stars!",1425427200,3,1203,5.055555555555555

While there are some vices to explain to little ones, many lessons can be learned in a way that does not grow faint with the passing of time. My 7-yr-old just watched it with us, and afterward, she was asking if there was a second one. She wants to read books about the family and to see more. Even though it is not full of action, sex, and violence, she was enthralled! Then again, we don't have a TV and she doesn't spend her life on an i-phone, so maybe she has a bit more of an attention span than most North American children today. I suggest watching it. I don't think you'll be disappointed. The book from which the film was made is also available on Amazon.

855524,5,6304383169,"""I remember Mama"" is a classic movie. A MUST SEE, as some would say.

I was born in the mid 50's not the 1800's and grew up in the south and my mother was born in America too. But Irene Dunn as ""Mama"" reminds me a great deal of my own loving mother who would do whatever she could to make me as happy as she could under the circumstances of having 3 other children who were older than me.

And... it's fun to see Barbara Bel Geddes, the Mama on the TV program ""Dallas"" as a young woman.

I ordered it from TCM and received the wrong DVD. So I called them and they sent one out again. When I finally recieved the correct movie, it played for 24 mins and stopped.  Thankfully, TCM credited my account and I ordered it from Amazon as I should have done in the first place.

855954,5,6304383169,"This is one of my mother's favorite movies. Focused on a Norwegian family living in San Francisco during the early 1900s, the film begins with seemingly unrelated and unspectacular events in chronological order, but gradually develops from these scenes to showcase the difficulties of immigrant life, the maturation of the family's eldest daughter, and, most importantly, the stalwart presence of Mama (Irene Dunne).

As it is a family drama, for lack of a better term, I went in to watching the film with the expectation that I would find it average at best. This was not the case. Although the film doesn't have the in-your-face melodrama of dramatic films of the modern day, ""I Remember Mama"" will grab not only your attention, but your heart, and it will do so with a stately subtlety that makes it unique among dramatic films.

Irene Dunne was one of my favorite actors; my mother appreciated her, too.

My daughter wants my 12-year-old granddaughter to view this video, as well, because she would enjoy the humor and the way the family bond together, getting through circumstances with love and great strength.  It was fun looking up some actors to see the ones we had seen in TV series.  If you see it, look up the main character who narrates the story.  I would never have recognized her!

856393,5,6304383169,"This film is one of my family's favorites and is based on the book ""Mama's Bank Account"" by Kathryn Forbes. It follows the lives of a Norwegian immigrant family to San Fransisco in the early 1900s, and uses the character of Mama to exemplify the indomitable and hopeful spirit of the family. Their adventures include the immediate family, as well as the three snoopy or timid aunts, their very vocal Uncle Chris, a cat named Uncle Elizabeth, and a few colorful friends. I love all of the characters, but I especially appreciate Mama. Every story shares more about Mama's resourcefulness, diligence, and intense love for her family. Every girl could learn a great deal from Mama, as Kathryn does throughout the story and as I did when I was growing up. What seems at first to be a straight-forward story turns out to have several intriguing plot twists, especially in relation to Mama's bank account.

Note: For conscientious movie-watchers, the film includes:
- Smoking, including one young man's humorous introduction to pipe-smoking
- A joke about Norwegian swear words (we're not even sure that the words are actually swear words or only meant to make people think they are swear words)
- A woman that the characters speculate may be a common-law wife or mistress (she isn't)

Overall, I highly recommend I Remember Mama.",1360540800,,1324,4.90625
856394,5,6304383169,"This past holiday, I gave this film to a wonderful lady met at work.
I work in a hospital and oftentimes find myself drawn into the most interesting conversations with people.
She was disheartened at the caliber of today's films, and wistfully recalled movies from the 1930's and 1940's as being the best ever made. I agreed, and added 1950's to that sum.
To me, those were decades that remain unsurpassed in the arena of cinematic grandeur, charm, substance, quality and style. Moreover, the actors were phenomenal. Just that fabulous.
My elderly patient and I speculated about who was -A Dish- . Of course, Cary Grant tops my list (it's really a tie between he and Gregory Peck) .
My patient also adores Cary Grant (her words: Dream Boat (: )
This then led into leading ladies, with Irene Dunne being his most favored.
Agree agree agree! They went together so well.
- Irene is fantastic in this film. She stands superbly on her own, even sans a leading man.
Admittedly, I was acclimated to seeing her in more fun, happier, even some kookier roles, but she outdoes herself as always here, notwithstanding a much more subdued and serious character. She performs flawlessly and has an impressive supporting cast, all winners.
The film is long.
It takes a bit to warm up to the setting and storyline. Be patient. It is well done and merits at least viewing twice before you form an opinion either way.
Ones who grew up with this will not be surprised or disappointed.
The film is good, solid, decent, and conveys a strong message of togetherness and the strength of family bonds.
I would rather not include spoilers in any film (and most book) reviews I write, because I don't want to ruin any plot or ending etc for first time viewers; but if you are a fan of true classics and silver screen stars...this movie will warm your heart.
My dear patient is thrilled with this film.
She relayed to me how happy it it makes her to have seen this again, after so many years.
So glad am I that I could bring her bits of joy with this small gesture.

856554,5,6304383169,"I REMEMBER MAMA? I'm not very good at ""reviewing"" films. With that said, I'd like to tell you that the first time I saw I REMEMBER MAMA was as a twelve year old girl and I watched it with my own mama. The story is about a Norwegian family that immigrated to San Francisco near the turn of the century....the twentieth century, that is. It's about their rather large family and extended family of aunts and their blustery, larger than life uncle who is head of the family in the new country, but most importantly it is about the woman who, with her old and new world values holds this large family together. The story unfolds through the writings of the eldest daughter who fancies herself an author, and by finally writing about something that is ""real and true"" becomes just that. The star of her story is, of course, Mama, played here endearingly and expertly by Irene Dunn. Ms. Dunn is one of those ""earlier"" stars who like our Meryl Streep has the ability to ""become"" the character she plays. The rest of the cast, from the head of the family Uncle Chris to the youngest daughter Dagmar and her cat Uncle Elizabeth are not just characters on a page, but real and true people, each with their own interests and storylines. This is an excellent feel-good movie that i highly recommend and once you watch it, i'm sure that you'll Remember Mama too.",1341878400,,1349,4.510204081632653
856555,3,6304383169,"There was a TV show by the same name that ran from 1949 to 1957. So from the day my grandparents finally bought a TV when I was almost five until the time I was ten, I saw the show which was, I see now, only very loosely based on this movie, and the stage play before it. About the only thing that's the same is the names of the characters and the location: San Francisco.

Katrin (Barbara Bel Geddes) wants to be a writer someday, and she's the one that's writing this story. Her mother is Marta (Irene Dunne), who was born in Norway. She and her young husband came to San Francisco because all her sisters lived there, and ""it's good for families to be together."" Papa is a carpenter, a union man we eventually discover, and not very much a part of the story except to be the strong, silent one smoking his pipe and being somewhat indulgent to his children. The oldest is Nils, the only boy. Then there's Katrin, Christine, and Dagmar.

It may seem like a pretty conventional family story, with those who get along and those that don't. Those that are loud and bossy, and those that are quiet and sometimes walked on. Three aunts, one very boisterous uncle, and then there's the undertaker that wants to marry one of the aunts, and there's ""that woman."" I won't spoil it, but basically she is loud Uncle Peter's ""housekeeper,"" the one the aunts all gossip about.

Mama is quiet and sensible, but she is a lioness about her children. When Dagmar is taken to the hospital for emergency surgery, she is told that the hospital has a rule of no visitors for the first 24 hours. She protests that she promised Dagmar she would be there for her, and she's worried the child will be frightened. Naturally, she finds a way to get in to see Dagmar anyway.

It's not a comedy story, but there is considerable humor in it. When Dagmar names the stray cat she took in Elizabeth, Nils tells her she'd better choose a different name because Elizabeth is a tom. She resists, so Papa suggests she call him Uncle Elizabeth, and Uncle Elizabeth he becomes. Then when Uncle Elizabeth is in a terrible fight and is suffering from his wounds, Mama and Papa decide the only decent thing to do is chloroform him.

It's 1910 in San Francisco, and Mama (Irene Dunne) and her husband (Philip Dorn), a carpenter, have lived in America for some 15 years, raising four American children--Nels (Steve Brown), 14, whose current greatest ambition is to go on to high school; Katrin (Barbara Bel Geddes), 12, who dreams of being a writer; Christine (Peggy McIntyre), 10; and little Dagmar (June Hedin), the animal-lover, who eventually declares her wish to become a veterinarian, and meanwhile takes in a tomcat she names Uncle Elizabeth, a dog who presents her with puppies, and a litter of five white bunnies.  Their extended family includes Mama's sisters, overbearing Aunt Jenny (Hope Landin), whiney Aunt Sigrid (Edith Evanson) and her lame son Cousin Arne (Tommy Ivo), shy spinster Aunt Trina (Ellen Corby), and their Uncle Chris (Oscar Homolka), a gruff ""black Norwegian"" who for many years has openly lived with his housekeeper (Barbara O'Neil) on his ranch north of the city.

They don't have very much money so many times they have to make a count of what money there is before they spend it. Uncle Chris teaches the young boy how to say a swear word, only to hear that Mama doesn't favor it. Uncle Chris is the head of the family, so to speak, as what he says goes. The 2 aunts are mostly full of talk, but that doesn't count with the rest of the family. One day Mama and the younger daughter take a walk on one of the streets in San Francisco and they stop in a store so that her daughter can buy a pencil box. Mama has to do without what she wants in order to make her daughter happy. Soon the family has to make a decision on a major need that they have. The younger daughter takes the pencil box back to the store and Mama gives her broche to a seller. It was a keepsake of the family. The older daughter wanted to take a trip to a place that she was anxious to go to and that is why the family went without things that they had so that she could make the trip. The younger daughter is disappointed and asks why she couldn't go instead of her older sister. Mama stops her fussing. Near the end of the movie Uncle Chris is in bed as he thinks that he is about to die. He has all of the family come around him and now and then Uncle Chris asks for ""a drink"", an alcoholic beverage. Mama doesn't agree that he should have it, but now and then he asks for a drink. Mama gives in and gives him a drink and she also takes a drink to please him. Uncle Chris keeps talking for some time, but then he dies. The movie is about the everyday life of a poor family who comes from another country to live in the United States. There are many times that Mama goes without what she wants so as to make her family happy. Irene Dunne is Mama and she plays her role excellently. Papa is another that does his role just as good as his wife. The younger daughter starts the movie with part of the story of their family and now and then she adds more to it as the film goes on.

My thirteen year old granddaughter enjoyed watching this story with me eventhough she found the black and white images a little distracting.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Remember-Mama/dp/B0004Z322O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Remember Mama</a>",1265414400,,443,7.3584905660377355
856688,5,6304383169,"""For long as I could remember, the house on the Larkin Street Hill had been home. Papa and Mama had both been born in Norway but they came to San Francisco because Mama's sisters were here, all of us were born here. Nels, the oldest and the only boy, my sister Christine and the littlest sister Dagmar; but first and foremost, I remember Mama"".

So begins the heartwarming family drama of I REMEMBER MAMA (1948), based on John Van Druten's successful Broadway play, and the semi-autobiographical novel ""Mama's Bank Account"" by Kathryn Forbes.  Director George Stevens chose this as his first film project after returning from his duties in the Army Signal Corps in WW2, and it struck a nostalgic chord for the emotionally-matured director.  Part of his assignment was to film the liberation of the Dachau concentration camp and the landings at Normandy.  Those experiences stayed with the filmmaker and gave his later titles (chiefly ""Shane"", ""A Place in the Sun"" and ""The Diary of Anne Frank"") a darker edge that hadn't really been apparent in his earlier, pre-war movies.  I REMEMBER MAMA clearly struck a few chords for Stevens, and it's turn-of-the-century San Francisco setting and homespun values also resonated with audiences, who recognized those as things we were fighting for during the war.

I REMEMBER MAMA is really a collection of memories as opposed to a complete through-storyline, related to us by the eldest daughter Katrin (played by a young, fresh-faced Barbara Bel Geddes).  Mama (Irene Dunne) is the hard-working, loving yet stoic glue who holds the Hanson family together.  When Aunt Trina (Ellen Corby) wants to get married, first she appeals to Mama in gently breaking the news to their busybody sisters Jenny and Sigrid.  Then there's the time where Mama had to masquerade as a washer-woman in order to see little Dagmar (June Hedin) in the hospital; and all the trouble with Dagmar's cat Uncle Elizabeth on the day she was to return home.

Katrin herself wants to be a writer, but every time she puts pen to paper and invents her own fairytale characters it always turns into a disaster.  It's only after Mama ""arranges"" a meeting with famous author Florence Dana Moorhead (Florence Bates) that she finally discovers the key: to write about things and people you already know.  ""Write about Papa"", Mama instructs Katrin.  Little does Mama know how much she herself will figure in Katrin's stories...and in our hearts.

All the performances are sublime.  I REMEMBER MAMA boasted no less than four Academy Award-nominated performances (Irene Dunne as Mama, Barbara Bel Geddes as Katrin, Oscar Homolka as Uncle Chris, and Ellen Corby as Aunt Trina).  It's a movie filled with humour, hope and yes, heartbreak as well.  I guarantee you'll want to revisit Mama and the house on Larkin Street again and again!

The only downside to the current DVD from Warners is the badly-damaged print it contains.  Full of scratches, nicks and reel-cues, it clearly wasn't digitally prepared before being mastered for DVD.  That's a real shame but it doesn't entirely lessen the thrill of having this landmark title in my classic movie collection.

856693,5,6304383169,"There are two key reasons to watch this sentimental yet emotionally involving 1948 immigrant family saga today. The first is George Stevens' assured direction, his first post-WWII film and a palpable sign of his wartime experiences that portends his deepening sense of character in dramas like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Place-in-the-Sun/dp/B00003CXBZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Place in the Sun</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shane/dp/0792163710/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shane</a>&nbsp;after his years of breezy comedies and musicals. The second is star Irene Dunne, who caps her impressively versatile screen career with a performance of unforced warmth and uncommon depth. With no make-up and sporting a convincing Norwegian accent, she provides the film's heart and emotional anchor as Mama.

The framing device for the story is the recently completed manuscript by Katrin Hanson which she reads out loud while reminiscing about her Norwegian family in San Francisco circa 1910. A family of six living on hilly Larkin Street, the Hansons maintain their core family unit despite a lot of hardships and eccentric relatives. While father Lars toils as a carpenter to support his family, Katrin's memories inevitably revolve around her stoic mother Martha, who consistently shows the courage of her convictions. When spinsterish Aunt Trina decides to marry a milquetoast pharmacist, it is Martha who must get consensus from her intolerant sisters Jenny and Sigrid as well as Uncle Chris, a black-sheep blowhard who acts as the family patriarch. When Katrin's baby sister Dagmar goes to the hospital overnight, it is Martha who disguises herself as a charwoman to be able to stay with her. And when Katrin becomes discouraged enough to give up her writing aspirations, it is again Martha who finagles her way to meeting a famous author and convincing her to read one of Katrin's short stories.

Beyond Dunne's exemplary work, there is a sturdy supporting cast to consider - Oscar Homolka bringing the requisite bluster to Uncle Chris, Ellen Corby in her only first-rate screen role as timid Aunt Trina, and at 25, Barbara Bel Geddes conveying convincing adolescent innocence as Katrin. DeWitt Bodeen's screenplay captures the episodic nature of the real Katrin Forbes' remembrance and one can assume of John Van Druten's Broadway play. It should be noted that without Stevens and Dunne, the film would surely feel far more interminable at its 134-minute running length. The 2004 DVD is sparse on extras offering only a three-minute introduction from George Stevens Jr. and the original theatrical  trailer.",1237680000,,2716,5.836272040302267

It appears that no effort was made to find a good quality print, let alone do a restoration. The extras are pitiful and would lead one to think that Irene Dunne had no long history of film roles behind her (which she had) or that Barbara Bel Geddes had no future after this film (which she  did). And what of the stage play? Did I see a glimpse of Marlon Brando in that hastily shown photo (this play was his stage debut). And what of Oscar Homolka's role in the play and the film? He was brilliant. Rudy Vallee was also a standout and an oveview of his film career would have been a worthwhile addition. It's a shame that the people who issue these oldie goldies aren't aware that a lot of us weren't even born until many, many decades later and that we want/need all that ""filler' information.

Without proper context it seemed syrupy and manipulative.

The wonderful Irene Dunne has one of her best roles as Marta Hansen, matriarch of a large, loving Norwegian-American family. The family's various adventures introduce us to literary daughter Katrin (Barbara Bel Geddes); shy, fluttery Aunt Trina (Ellen Corby); blustery, hard-drinking Uncle Chris (Oscar Homolka); and a whole gallery of prickly but lovable eccentrics. After a steady diet this fall of superbly made but bleak crime dramas, I was delighted to turn to ""I Remember Mama,"" which concerns no more and no less than a family whose members love each other, and whose lives have meaning and purpose. Stevens and screenwriter DeWitt Bodeen (working from John Van Druten's play) provide abundant warmth, charm, and poignancy while using a blessedly light hand with the saccharine. Modern viewers inevitably will be reminded of ""The Waltons,"" both because of the aspiring writer in the family and the presence of Ellen Corby. ""I Remember Mama,"" however, avoids the ickiness that enveloped ""The Waltons"" in its later seasons as the writers ran out of both ideas and original cast members. (Trivia question: name the famous film, also set in San Francisco, made ten years after ""I Remember Mama"" and featuring both Barbara Bel Geddes and Ellen Corby.)

856908,5,6304383169,This movie is one of the most educational films for kids of today to watch. It shows kids how they should look up to their elders and learn from them.

856909,5,6304383169,"This movie is one of my personal favorites. It shows how European immigrants in the early 20th century voluntarily became a part of our country/culture, and how they appreciated being here. As I had European grandparents and witnessed all the family interacting (with 11 aunts/uncles who were born in this country), the story is very true to real life.  I warmly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see how the immigrants had a strong desire to become a part of the U.S. society.",1169078400,4,487,4.729411764705882

856911,5,6304383169,"If you haven't seen ""I Remember Mama"", where have you been?  Probably the same place I was until a few weeks ago when I viewed this excellent movie.  No wonder it was made into a TV show after it was released.  The characters are memorable.  The acting is great.  The plot is interesting.  I loved the scenes of 1910 San Francisco.  It's just fun to be in amongst the old shops with all the early authentic advertising fixtures in place- a very nostalgic trip.  To catch a glimpse of how life was for immigrants almost a hundred years ago in the city and to be cleanly entertained- what a treat!  I don't think it would be possible to make a movie this charming today.  If you can't guess yet, I HIGHLY recommend ""I Remember Mama""!",1155081600,10,731,4.348148148148148
856957,5,6304383169,"A few years ago, a competent local acting group put on the play ""I Remember Mama"".  I went to the play, was impressed with the quality of our local actors and actresses, and wondered why anyone would have wanted to see such a dumb collection of trivial incidents.  I remembered that Irene Dunne was a nominee for Best Actress for her role as Mama but the play left me wondering if Martha Raye (or Phyllis Diller in a later production) might not have been the better choice.  The events were so commonplace, I assumed that they were supposed to be funny (and the humor wasn't working well).  Fortunately, after taping it 6 months ago, I finally decided to check the movie.  There had to be SOME reason it was considered such a good movie.

I found the answer to my question when I realized that the power in ""I Remember Mama"" was in the outstanding performances.  There were actually 4 persons nominated for Oscars for their roles in ""I Remember Mama"".  I think the only other nomination was for Cinematography or something like that.  Giving credit also to Director George Stevens for bringing all this together, I was impressed by how such day to day things could be elevated to such powerful images.  Just about all families deal with the loss of a pet, the hospitalization of a child, a zany and/or eccentric relative that comes to visit, budgeting the household funds to make do and have the occassional surprize, sacrificing something of value to give something of greater value, etc, etc, etc.  Being able to sense the humanity in all of the characters was quite an accomplishment for the whole production.  I found myself misty-eyed over the same mundane sketches that made me look at my watch during the play.  The discrepancy was not a comment on our local thespians.  Rather, it was a testament to a director's vision of how to use everyday family life as a means to look at family life itself.  The close-up look at each individual character in the midst of group settings made ""I Remember Mama"" a film that I will remember as well.",1148169600,10,2043,4.620498614958449

856959,5,6304383169,"Seven reasons why this has always been one of my all-time favorite films:

1) A movie filled with nice, ordinary people you can relate to.

2) The sweetness of Barbara Bel Geddes and her character. She narrates throughout and this story is as much hers as it is ""Mama's.""

3) The great facial closeups and general cinematography, directed by one of the all-time best, George Stevens.

4) Oscar Homolka's performance as the gruff-but-kindhearted ""Uncle Chris""

5) An amazing supporting cast which help make this film so memorable: Ellen Corby, Philip Dorn, Edgar Bergen, Cedric Hardwicke, Hope Landin, Peggy McIntyre, Florence Bates, Steve Brown, Rudy Valley, Tommy Ivo, etc.

6) Some important life lessons in here for all viewers.

7) Nice touches of sentimentality, with the hard-working devoted mother (played stoically-yet-warmly by Irene Dunne) getting her due in the end.",1145404800,13,877,5.266187050359712

856961,3,6304383169,"As a child I loved the Movie.  Seeing it once again, I did enjoy it, but I have to admit it was kind of corny. I guess as the saying goes, ""You can't go back!""",1126483200,,159,3.5428571428571427
856962,5,6304383169,"""I Remember Mama"" presents a gentle and compassionate portrait of a family of Norwegian immigrants who settle in San Francisco in the early 1900's.  The movie is narrated by the family's eldest daughter, now an adult, who has written a memoir about her childhood and her colorful family.  Her family includes Mama, Papa, siblings, and some overbearing but well-intentioned aunts and uncle.

Nothing sensational or terribly exciting happens in the lives of these ordinary, working class immigrants.  Yet, there is extraordinary poignance in the way in which the family deals with everyday crises such as the fate of an injured pet cat or the dilemma of a mother who is not allowed to see her child in the hospital.

Acclaimed director George Stevens reconstructs such events with an honesty and delicacy that resonates long after the movie ends.  And Stevens elicits superb performances from his cast led by Irene Dunne as the title character ""Mama"".  Dunne's performance is beautifully restrained as the humble, selfless matriach who possesses an indomitable spirit and generous heart.  The rest of the talented ensemble includes familiar and beloved actors such as Oscar Homolka, Barbara Bel Geddes aka Miss Ellie on the television series ""Dallas"", and Ellen Corby of ""The Waltons"" fame.

""I Remember Mama"" is the kind of movie that will evoke childhood memories and remind you to appreciate where you came from and how far you've arrived.",1115596800,117,1440,5.145922746781116
856963,4,6304383169,"This film, along with Hitchcock's ""Paradine Case"" were both turned down by none other than Greta Garbo with the famous note to her agent ""No Mama's, No Murderesses"".  ""Paradine"" tanked, but Irene got the Oscar.  Still, can we imagine Garbo as a Mama?",1105833600,5,250,4.790697674418604
856964,3,6304383169,"In retrospect George Steven's production of ""I Remember Mama"" is the high water mark in 1940s family life melodrama. Set at the turn of the last century in San Francisco, the film stars the usually scatterbrained Irene Dunne; on this occasion as the tender yet determined matriarch, Martha Hanson.  Together with her husband, Lars (Philip Dorn) and extended family (buttressed by a stellar cast including Barbara Bel Geddes, Cedric Hardwicke, Ellen Corby, Rudy Vallee, Edgar Bergan and Florence Bates) the Norwegian clan weathers some hard knocks and poignant moments with grace and charm. This is one of those elegant little `jabs of pleasure' that American cinema used to dole out en masse during its golden age, but now seems rendered in exceedingly short supply. Based on John Van Druten's hit play (derived from Kathryn Forbes's autobiographical memoir), the film is a veritable feast for the heart and mind; a richly textured and moving experience - not to be missed.

Unfortunately more could have been done to clean up this print before rushing it out to DVD. Warner's transfer is marred by a considerable amount of age related artifacts. Though the gray scale is nicely balanced at times, the image often tends to exhibit an overly soft quality that is more blurry than evocative of mood or style. There is also a considerable amount of film grain present in most scenes. Otherwise, black and contrast levels on the whole tend to be deep and nicely balanced. There are no digital anomalies. The audio is mono and suffers at times from a muffled characteristic. Background hiss is detected in quiescent scenes. A brief introduction by the director's son, George Steven's Jr. is all the extras you get. Bottom line; this film still gets my recommendation for a must have Christmas stocking stuffer. It may not be presented here in its optimal condition but regardless, is sure to warm the heart throughout the holidays and beyond.",1102118400,82,1937,4.993808049535604

Quickly the story brought tears to our eyes as we so easily identified with the people, of a time long ago in California.  We grew up in the days when I Remember Mama was a weekly and ""live"" T-V program with Peggy Wood. Surely this series was inspired by the movie with Irene Dunn handling the lead role. My wife and I pondered the distance entertainment has traveled since the days of 1910 as portrayed in this classic film. It is safe to say that even in those days there would have been disfunctional families; not every family was like the Larson's. But it was a sweeter time, a time when family members seemed to care for each other in ways seldom depicted in today's films and TV programs.  It is a film which can stand along side others like Fiddler on the Roof, Its a Wonderful Life and A Christmas Story.  Its a film worth watching often.",1073174400,9,938,4.373563218390805
