3665659,1,B001KF6F8U,"Tagline: Things change.
Plot: A tight knit group of good looking, successful gay men in New York City have their lives upturned when a hot young stranger with a bitter past enters their circle. He first adds excitement to their routine but soon causes rifts among them, all the while letting his own relationships unravel around him.
Both touching and funny, WHIRLWIND is a subtle and honest depiction of thirty-something gay men and the crossroads they must face.

Review: This is my first ever review & it's going to be a harsh one. I just had to say, what was on my mind. I've lent this movie from a friend, after watching I was so glad I didn't have to spend a sent for buying this disc. To put it bluntly, that movie was so awful. The production was so cheap as well as the actors & the acting. Of cause there are some pretty cute guys in it, but that not enough to keep me glued to the monitor, watching the flick. Music is basically the same, it sucked as well! It's nothing like ""sex & the city"", it is far from it! I mean from the beginning of the movie, during the diner scene, you could actually see microphones, several times during the same scene. That's a major mistake. I would worked, like for a porno, but not this movie. And unfortunately this one is full of those stupid mistakes.

Most films in the LGBT genre are not so good. 'Whirlwind' is no exception. Full of shallow characters & clichs. You would say, that most of gats are like that & you would be right. But the movie as well as the script are very superficial & pretentious. It could have worked if they had focused on one storyline or one idea, but it is so full of characters & story lines, you can never truly invest yourself to anyone or anything. The acting is very stiff & seems melodramatic, forced, and amateur. Overall, the film fails on all levels. Even the sex scenes are not believable.

I would love to say I enjoy more movies like this, but most are really awful! I guess I'm still looking for a truly great picture. I wish the GLBT community would demand better entertainment, but it seems like naked bodies & sex are all we are ever given (and too bad most of us are appeased by that).

3665660,2,B001KF6F8U,"This flick is just a ""Queer as Folk"" rip off except is has a dull story and very light sex.  Kind of a ""PG"" version of ""QAF"".  Get drunk, get stoned, go to a night club.  The trailer was more entertaining and much cheaper.",1237593600,5,222,4.0
3665661,4,B001KF6F8U,This is generally a good and entertaining film.  The subject matter is very true to fact in general to today's lives but even more so in the time period the movie portrays.,1235952000,3,172,4.375
3665662,5,B001KF6F8U,"This was a terrific movie, one of the best gay movies I've seen.  It's intelligent, funny, touching, smart....  I could go on, but you get the idea.  The acting is great and the dialogue is very well written.

I loved the premise of this movie.  The protagonist sets out to destroy the relationships between a group of people to satisfy his own bitter and twisted ends.  Unfortunately, he doesn't count on the fact that these people have deep and honest feelings for each other.  I won't say more, just that this movie has a very satisfying ending.",1233014400,29,548,4.587628865979381
3665663,5,B001KF6F8U,"I saw this film at Newfest in New York City last summer and loved it.  Think gay ""Sex and the City""!  I wish this film would be turned into a series...I think it would be great.",1231459200,10,177,3.888888888888889
3665664,5,B001KF6F8U,"Very nice story.  I would watch this over and over again.  Thank you for making this movie!
Wonderful scenery and setting.",1398211200,,122,4.761904761904762
3665665,5,B001KF6F8U,"There were many things that I enjoyed about this film. The musical score was the most noticible. Very good use of Jazz throughout the film and played in the appropriate places. The story is very solid. What I most liked is the nature of the friendships of the characters. What better set of friends to have than those who know you best, flaws and all, can tell you what they are and criticize you for them, offer suggestions, and still love you warts and all. That kind of thing doesn't happen very often.  But as one of the protagonists says, ""you are my family"".

The interesting thing about the guy who stirs up the whirlwind to deal with his own failed relationship, is that he will probably end up some years in the future as ""one tired old queen"", the dashing looks a thing of the past, replaced by someone gone way over the hill and rolling down to the bottom, and still not have a clue how he got there!  And the friends and the women in their lives, still very much in the present.

I found it a bit disconcerting that the ""gang"" seemed really isolated in the film. But then again, big city life can be like that and being a minority tends to breing people together for safety and fusion. It would have been interesting to see how the two African-American friends in the group saw their identities being black, or whether that even played a role in who they were.

I would like the players in the film to redue the film in about 10-15 years to see where they were emotionally, and mentally as they had matured.
All in all, a great cast, plugged into a compelling script, done up very well.",1388620800,,1598,4.348993288590604
3665666,5,B001KF6F8U,Some good acting here. And I really enjoyed this very relevant movie. Also great to see Karma at work here. Think that most guys will be able to relate to this movie,1362355200,,165,4.1875
3665667,1,B001KF6F8U,"Last night I was going through my movies searching for one to loan to a friend. In the process, I cam across this little gem and did not remember anything about it. I had to fast-forward through parts of it to refresh my memory.  I refreshed my memory.  This movie is dreadful and a waste of time.  I have trashed it.  It was just taking up room in my collection.  I am lost for a redeeming word to say about it.",1359849600,,412,4.037037037037037
3665668,2,B001KF6F8U,"2 or 3 stars? I really could not decide.
Whirlwind is nothing special. Mediocre actors with a less than mediocre script and a very predictable ending.
There are far better films out there than this.
If you're looking for good-looking guys on film, this film has a few, but the film could have been far better in many ways.
Worthy of a re-watch? No.",1340236800,,348,4.453125
3665669,4,B001KF6F8U,"This film constantly offers, tantalisingly, more than it delivers visually as filmed with perhaps all too much restraint, but ""Whirlwind"" is a potently sexy video, for all of that. Reviews and descriptions elsewhere on the WWW give a very good idea of the plot and character motivations that drive ""Whirlwind"", and I refer those who want to know more of that to such descriptions and reviews elsewhere on ""The ""Web"". I would add simply that, for all its merits, this film (like so many others from the Wolfe Video and Pride labels) has the feel and production values of television. It comes across rather as an extended ""gay sit-com"".

For those for whom David Rudd (Drake) draws a sharp intake of breath for the teasingly (and potently) sexual arousal (but pants-on) that the photo on the DVD's front box cover (of Drake staring at himself in a mirror) can evoke, it should be noted that there really is not much nudity that would reveal more of Rudd's splendidly virile physique; even that cover photo does not correspond to any specific moment of what the viewer sees of David Rudd in the film.

Rudd's Drake has some very torrid embraces with other good-looking men here and there (not all of them members of the intimate friendship group the portrayal of which is the centre of interest in the film), kissing them passionately, as Drake so locks lips in hearty lust with nearly any man in whom this cynical sensualist takes an interest. During such moments, even the shirtless views of Rudd's potent and hirsute male beauty are few and only partially revealing. Neither is there any truly full-frontal nudity of any others of the film's actors, some of whom are quite attractive. More male nudity, tastefully handled, in a film with this kind of plot could have been quite appropriate. However, there is enough glimpsed to make the viewer understand just how such a cunning, stunningly gorgeous, and powerfully sexy man as Drake (Rudd) can succeed in seducing, not only through devious psychological manipulation, but also so many of them outright sexually, the gay men in the friendship circle which Drake sets out to disband.

Recommendable for those who are content with modest (but good) production values. I am gettig used to thinking of most Wolfe productions as ""gay TV movies"" (good ones) rather than as full-fledged, glamourously cinematic productions. On its own level, Wolfe Video's ""Whirlwind"" satisfies.",1294704000,3,2421,4.943488943488943
3665670,4,B001KF6F8U,"Overall, the movie was good.  The acting wasn't bad, though at times it could've been better.  The story line was well done, but it reminded me of other movies - 'the concept has already been done'.  If you are looking for a movie that has some drama, break up's and a happy ending, then this movie would be a good choice.",1289347200,2,322,4.245901639344262
3665671,1,B001KF6F8U,"I am disappointed in this movie. I obtained it based on reviews here at Amazon, but found it to be simple, cliched, and seemed to stick to gay stereotypes....very boring and not at all in line with the reviews I had read.",1287446400,,221,4.285714285714286
3665672,3,B001KF6F8U,"I had watched it without checking reviews posted on Amazon. I did it later. I can't agree with people, who call the movie very good and with those, who criticize it.
The main characters are likeable, but there is little chemistry between them. And the plot seems in some parts quite ridiculous (hmmm, 5 men, some of them in their late 30's behave like puppets in the hands of one mean gay...pls!)
I gave it 3 of 5 because it didn't hurt me to watch it till the end. It is not on my list ""to buy"", but if you have some time and possibilty to rent it, do it.",1282867200,4,556,4.0636363636363635
3665673,5,B001KF6F8U,"I saw this movie without much hope to find something worthy, since I read only negative reviews around. And instead it's a nice comedy, with a tinge of drama, but not too much, with nice characters, and without much angst. It's not obviously a big money movie, it's low budget, and there are some points that could be better developed to make this a very good movie (like Mick's story with the cute server, or Drake's unresolved past), but nevertheless it's not so bad as you could imagine reading the reviews. Sean and Bobby are really cute, they are real and sweet, and playboy Desmond who falls for plain-john Louis is one of the best part of the movie.",1278288000,2,656,4.5210084033613445
3665674,3,B001KF6F8U,"The concept of the movie is great, but I wish I could say the same for the acting it was pretty terrible.  I really like the fact that there was an interracial couple in the moive you don't see that vry often especially in gay movies.  what i didn't like is even though at the end the couple got back together, the group of friends remained friends it didn't matter Drake accomplished what he set out to do the cutie cheated on his hottie boyfriend, so in the end Drake was right....",1268956800,,483,4.239130434782608
3665675,3,B001KF6F8U,"Many slow points in this movie.  Some pretty unrealistic scenarios as well, I thought.  Overall I'd give it a C+, but it definitely was not worth the $23.",1266105600,,154,4.464285714285714
3665676,3,B001KF6F8U,"Unless I got a defective copy of the DVD - THERE IS NO NUDITY IN THIS FILM and hardly any sex (on camera). That aside, I liked the broad, narrative outlines of this film. All of the writer and director's best friends found speaking roles in it, I believe, and every ""good"" line found it's way into the script, regardless of whether it fit with the timing or flow of the scenes. This is one of those films where I wish someone would take the story arc, the premise, the settings and make a good, film out of it - even one which contains some explicit lovemaking. Explicit sex and a lot more nudity would not have been out of place in this, mediocre version of the film. In fact they would have helped. But as it stands, this was an okay film which would be appropriate for gay teenagers or to watch with one's mother. It's that tame. Oh, and could someone tell the characters that if they lay off the drugs they might be able to plan a party in fewer than the three months it seems to take in the film? Just a thought.",1264204800,12,1017,4.16751269035533
3665677,1,B001KF6F8U,"I have just watched this movie. Well that was a wastre of 90 minutes of my life. Do guys in NY really find it that hard o throw a party? There wasn't the slightest chemistry between Sean and Bobby. The dialogue was dreadful and the acting....well, I guess the guys were embarrassed that they were even in the damn movie.

3665679,3,B001KF6F8U,"The film quality is extremely poor and the story line is fairly predictable.  If you are looking for an updated version of the ""Boys in the Band"", then you'll enjoy this film.  The gay relationships in the film seem somewhat forged.  It lacks on character development.  It's not a DVD that I will hold on to in my collection.  In other words, buy some thing else.",1248912000,4,363,4.4393939393939394

3665682,4,B001KF6F8U,"The dating experience for NYC gay men is a ""Whirlwind"" (2007) of players, a compulsion to be judged as ""hot,"" manipulative jerks, and missed opportunities ... at least as it is portrayed in this commendable gay indie film, which won several audience awards at gay film festivals.

It features a solid cast of actors, many with Broadway stage credits, who come together to realistically portray a diverse group of thirty-something gay men, along with assorted ""straight but not shallow"" friends. Likely the characters were written to be stereotypes of a sort intentionally, to assure the viewer would be able to identify with at least one or two of them.  There's the monogamous gay couple, having some problems with maturity and responsibility, and a handsome and personable guy who seems to have an aversion to dating the same guy twice. Add in a quiet man who has still not ""moved on"" from the sudden death of his partner in an auto accident two years before, and then there's the likeable but plain guy who keeps asking his friends for advice on how to better live his life. The dynamics of this closeknit group of friends is strained by a handsome newcomer, an event planner at local bars, who feeds on others' insecurities and manipulates them for his own amusement.

Although very well acted and directed, the situations seemed way too contrived to me, and best I can give it is four stars out of five.  The DVD includes director commentary, a video of the actors' first table read, and a behind-the-scenes slide show.",1240358400,6,1524,4.805343511450381

Some of the reviews have been negative regarding the sex scenes while at the same time commenting on the ""stereotypical"" representation of gay social dynamics and movie genre. I found the sex scenes done tastefully and artistic while being erotic without using stereotypical provocative motions or camera movements that are more common in this genre. It is a change in the format which in my opinion, can help open this genre to a broader, less informed audience while maintaining the dignity and pride of the community.

I recommend this movie for all viewers who are interested in a story that normalizes gay social interactions, while providing the viewer with adequate sensory stimulation.",1413331200,,838,5.246268656716418
