1899868,1,B0000A02XG,"Well, after seeing the first Scarecrow, I was pretty sure they couldn't do a worse Scarecrow, but I was wrong, wrong, wrong, baby. Only Hatred of a Minute this movie from being perhaps the worst horror movie in the universe---although House of the Dud would give this movie a fine brawl. First of all, to make sure that I'm getting things straight, apparently, in the Scarecrow ""Mythos"", if you die within eight feet of a scarecrow---ostensibly any scarecrow---your soul will jump into the scarecrow's body. So, if you're feeling a little thin in the skin, hotfoot it to your local cornfield ASAP. Then, all you have to do is wait for some chick to kill you with fire or a garden thresher, and your soul will jump into HER body. See how it works?

What in the blue hell happened to the Candyman? Dear God. He was on the X-Files once, he was the Candyman, he was the Grim Reaper in those Final Destination movies. How did he end up here? Somebody out there call this poor guy and give him another decent role in a functioning movie. But of course, not even the Candyman, the Grim Reaper, Chuckie, the Creature from the Black Lagoon, Dracula, ""the Humungus"", the Tooth Fairy, Captain Kirk, Shooter McGavin or the Main Man Jason Voorhees could save this stinkbomb.

At the beginning of the movie, the Candyman has the Scarecrow trapped, lashed to a post, but was this supposed to be the Scarecrow from the first movie? Because THAT Scarecrow ended up soul-jumping into that chick with the gigantic...uh...smile. Not to mention that fact that this new Scarecrow was supposed to have killed the Candyman's father several decades earlier. You can't even keep up with this crap, although, it might be easier if you gave a flying corncob. Anyway, the main guy of the movie gets croaked, jumps into the Scarecrow, and turns all evil for whatever reason. Also, throughout all of this, there's this screwball mass acceptance of the whole Scarecrow thing as some sort of lore to which everyone is automatically privy. There's alot of this: ""Hey, do you believe all those stories about the Scarecrow?"" What stories, what rumors, what legends? No one cares. You can't just make a horror icon like Voorhees or Freddy. It has to happen naturally, and it also requires more than six people lined up (at their local video store) to watch the movie.

Oh yeah, something else, there is NO Scarecrow ""Slayer"" in this movie. I wish there were. Some huge pissed-off crow with a claymore or a harpoon gun. That might have been better. Of course, a stunt like that might have required something just a notch higher than the movie's omnipresent ""computer technology"", which is used instead of any kind of physically-manufactured gore. This movie just sucks on so many different levels. I don't think there's really any kind of plot. The actors couldn't have been worse even if they had bred them on some farm for crappy actors. All of the characters suck, they need to die, die, die. The Scarecrow definitely sucks. But, the movie did have adequate closing credits.",1108252800,6,3039,4.741020793950851
1899869,1,B0000A02XG,"I was thrilled by Christopher Lambert's, ""high-speed "" dog sled chase...I suspended disbelief in the French Julius Caesar of Druids. I held just enough faith that there was some metephysical explanation for the vampiric bodyguards who mysteriously vanish after the first sequence of Mean Guns. Rabid Grannies have scampered across my tv screen in all their glory. Blind men are ravaged by their dogs for no reason at all in movies like Suspiria, and it's ok. I can even accept that in some bizarre world, it's possible to learn how to fly a fighter plane in some hidden passage of the Declaration of Independence to battle alien oppressors in Hubbard's delusions. Even such atrociously bad movies like Bio-zombie and Dead Alive (or...Peter Jackson original sin.) do not come close to the ...Plainly put, Scarecrow Slayer is the worst film I have ever seen...and I've run the gauntlet of even Christopher Lambert films and escaped with less trauma than I have from watching this movie. The only thing worse than having seen David Latt's ""movie"" was having seen it again with friends.

The acting is...check that..there is NO acting, except for perhaps Tony Todd. Why Tony Todd chose to act in this film..I can't say. One of my friends suggested that Latt must have had some pretty good dirt on Todd...I cannot imagine the Candyman waking up one day and deciding that this was a good career move unless Latt knew about the bodies in the closet. Also noteworthy is David Castro (I KNOW I've seen him somewhere else) as the nutball best friend who eventually becomes the second karate-practicing scarecrow. (pay special attention to his form as he back-kicks and flips his way through the final battle..stunt double, of course.) , and Nicole Kingston in her first starring role..I'm sure we'll be seeing Ms. Kinston many more times in the future. Of course..that's about all the cast they had money for..it almost seems like you see names appearing twice in the credits. I was half-expecting David Latt to jump in as one of the college marine kids.

It doesn't get better, of course..as one is dazzled by special effects that are worse than a two year's stick figure crayon drawings. Cell phones screech and appear to be plastered with a giant metallic sticker to show how they're going haywire in this thriller. Cars inexplicably turn up in different places then they were earlier. Hospitals are staffed with only two people. Doctors bake cookies to offer visitors before threatening to stick them with needles. Leading ladies throw themselves from second story windows so we may see them fall in slow motion. Phantom lights driving next to cars ..or sometimes appearing in the sky,  flitter across the screen. And, while we're at it...since when do college kids..(even if they plan on joining the marines) have access to enough weapons to walk down the streets of Paris in conquest? And why in god's name do they put these weapons down at EVERY oppurtunity. Instead of blowing up the Scarecrow with the bazooka he somehow retrieves in the course of this convoluted tale, the best friend PUTS DOWN the bazooka, and charges the Scarecrow. Which..brings me to the Scarecrow. The saving grace..if this movie has any, is actually the decent job done of the first scarecrow costume. While not particularly scary..care was obviously taken in the making of that costume, while it was not taken in the making of this movie. Unfortunately,the same cannot be said of the second Scarecrow's..kiddie halloween-looking farce.

If, after you've seen this film, you have chance to watch the informative Behind-the-Scenes, pay no attention to any equipment strewn about the set. It obviously was not used during the making of this...movie. I almost wept as Tony Todd tried to explain his presence in the movie..wanting only to say, "" It's ok..the charges won't stick.""  Summing up the movie perfectly, the skull-carrying ballerina crew member dances insanely during the Behind-the-Scenes portion..bringing me to the conclusion that the makers of this travesty were all on some sort of heavy hallucinogen.  Anyway..I wrote this in the vain attempt that anyone reading it will take my advice and steer clear of this movie...it is bad..and not good-bad. BAD.  Pay no attention to the one-star rating I gave this movie. This high school film project is not even worth that. Thanks.",1093651200,4,4358,4.986244841815681
1899870,1,B0000A02XG,"I'm not sure if this is the worst movie I have ever seen, but it comes close.

However, it is difficult to make such a claim, because this movie really doesn't compare to many other bad movies I have seen. Some just look like the sloppy work of Hollywood professionals. Others are bad because the filmmakers attempt to make something entertaining and fail. But this movie is different. This movie does have Tony Todd in it, but beyond having one (and only one) actor who has been in movies people have actually heard of, there is absolutely nothing professional about ""Scarecrow Slayer."" There is no evidence that the filmmakers actually tried to produce anything remotely resembling entertainment. There is also no evidence that they could do anything like that if they wished. This looks like a home movie.

Let me examine some of the flaws in detail.

First, the story is absurd and stupid. Caleb Kilgore (Tony Todd) has been obsessed all his life  with the scarecrow in question (it killed his father). One night some college kids are near Kilgore's house (barn?) preparing for some fraternity prank and one them, Dave, gets killed when the scarecrow falls on him and Kilgore, not knowing Dave to be beneath the scarecrow, shoots both of them. Somehow, Dave becomes the scarecrow and he begins slicing up people with his scythe (or throwing them to death or smashing their heads behind doors) in his apparent attempt to kidnap his girlfriend, Mary, and turn her into another scarecrow. (At least I think that's what happened. It wasn't entirely clear in the movie; I had to use the summary on the DVD box to know exactly what was supposed to be going on.) Second, the acting is bad. Most of the scenes were probably filmed in one take, so I will forgive the actors on their sloppy performances. (Of course, that is not to say that any of the actors have any talent.) Third, the camera work is horrible. Anytime you see lights in this movie, you also see glare. The picture is grainy, too. It was probably shot on an 8mm camcorder. Fourth, there is no sense of continuity or attention to detail. At one point, for example, a car is abandoned in a field, it later ends up parked next to a fence for no reason. It is also unclear how long time passes in the story. There is evidence both that the movie takes place over the course of one night and that it takes place over the course of a few days. What is the right answer? Who knows? (And who cares?)

And the special effects? They get a new paragraph. The special effects were quite literally the worst I have ever seen in any movie. That may seem like quite a statement, but you must realize that it is relative. If this movie had been made in say, the 1930s, I would only call the special effects mediocre. But this movie was made in 2003, and there are several sequences that literally look as if the special effects were produced on the director's laptop (assuming this movie had room in its budget for a laptop PC). And I am not exaggerating. You could probably recreate some of those sequences by buying some home-video-editing software from the bargain bin at CompUSA or downloading software from the Internet.

Finally, the supposedly remarkable climactic battle of scarecrow vs. scarecrow is mindbogglingly atrocious. Here's the background to this scene: Dave's best friend Karl is apparently in love with Dave because near the end of the movie, he wishes that Dave would kill him instead of Mary, making Karl into another scarecrow so that Dave and Karl could spend eternity together instead of Dave and Mary. (Isn't that sweet?) Anyway, Karl gets his wish (I would have warned you about the spoiler, but the summary on the box gives it away, as if you should give a hoot). But I guess Karl is not grateful for having been killed and turned into a scarecrow, because he tries to defeat Dave immediately afterwards. Now, within the context of this movie, it at least made a modicum of sense as to how Dave came to inhabit the body of a scarecrow. But where the second one came from is not clear at all. What is clear, however, is that this new one was assembled rather quickly because it was the worst costume I have ever seen -- consisting of brown pants, a brown shirt and some straw sticking out of the sleves and covering the feet.

Avoid this piece of garbage at all costs unless you are heavily under the influence of controlled substances and you have nothing better to do with your time (like pounding your head against a brick wall for 93 minutes or eating an entire container of styrophoam cups instead).",1092873600,2,4577,4.594859241126071
1899871,1,B0000A02XG,"This direct-to-video garbage centers around a scarecrow that takes over a college boy's soul and turns him into a killer. This is about as bad as it gets. The actors do their best. The lighting is good. The script is ok. The only person I can blame is the director and producer. As I watched this, I kept thinking ""How could you make a movie this bad? Even accidentally?"". A first year film student with an IQ of 10 could produce something more watchable than this. I love cheesy horror, but this is by far THE worst movie I've seen in 2 years! Give me 500 dollars and a crew that works for free and I could create a film 1,000 times more watchable.",1081900800,5,649,4.241935483870968
1899872,1,B0000A02XG,"Scarecrow Slayer is an abomination of a movie. This concerning (Mary) chasing whole movies by the scarecrow. Acting, it looks similar to college student. It was likely jeepers creeper and but more realistic than scarecrow. There performed was terrible, it felt like there be no director at all. The scarecrow then goes around killing people.

1899874,1,B0000A02XG,"I reiterate, ""What the hell?""..  This movie appeared to be filmed by a bunch of intoxicated highschool jocks.  My friend and I rented this movie for B-movie thrills, but all we found was a bunch of retarded co-eds running from a non-scary antagonist.  Speaking of the antagonist, a freaking scarecrow, and to top that, it used to be one of their friends.  And the way the guy was 'possessed' by the scarecrow was utterly cheesy, but still funny.  It looked like a horrible techno-rave scene by some guy trying to re-create a recent acid trip.
I wouldn't recommend renting, or buying this film unless you want to have a brain aneurism.  Seriously, it's that bad.  I suppose you could rent it just to make fun of it, but even then it's horrible.  I could have made a better movie using MSDOS.  That is really all I have to say about this pixelated crap-fest.",1076112000,2,856,4.542483660130719

7994848,5,B0000A02XG,"Having seen most of this flick I'm shocked that this is the 2nd in a series of about 3 films. I must get the others! But anyways the introduction to this movie is indication alone of its awesomeness. When you see the scarecrows hand moving across the floor in fast-motion you know you're in for a treat. And when you see the AMAZING effects done on the scene where the farmer gets thrown into a pitchfork (with his legs invisible for some great reason) you have already gotten what you paid for). Ok being serious now, it's f'ing sad to see Tony Todd in this film, he's an incredible actor and Hollywood needs to put better use of his talent instead of letting it go to waste. This film is like a prolonged episode of Are You Afraid Of The Dark, but even that had better effects. Nothing anyone can possibly say bad about this movie can be greater than the effect the movie itself has on the viewer. Watch it for the sake of comedy at least.",1178064000,,941,4.292134831460674
7994849,1,B0000A02XG,I have seen bad movies in my time but this one just may rank at the top of the list. If you want to see the worst special effects ever done in a movie you have to watch this turkey. I would really be embarassed for life if I was seen in this travesty by people who know me. Horrible acting and the plot is from somewhere out of this world. Also there is not one single scene in this dud that could scare you even if it came to life and jumped out of your tv screen. I certainly wouldn't invite anybody over to watch this unless they needed some sleep which they would be doing in a short while while viewing it.,1176854400,,611,3.935483870967742
7994850,3,B0000A02XG,"After reading other reviews about this movie, I guess I'm the oddball here but I enjoyed this movie. I'm a huge gore fan so maybe that is part of the reason I enjoyed this movie. I think Tony Todd ( Candyman ) gave a somewhat good performance as Farmer Caleb. In the beginning of the movie, we see Caleb as a young boy riding on a tractor with his father. Caleb then witnesses his father being killed by the scarecrow ( cool scene ). The film then takes us to some kids who decide to steal the scarecrow. When Caleb happens upon this, he shoots Dave who's soul goes into the scarecrow bringing the scarecrow back to life. The scarecrow has 2 things on his mind now, revenge and murder. However, still being part Dave now, the scarecrow is unable to kill his girlfriend Mary but kills everyone else who gets in his way. I really liked the hospital scene when the scarecrow murders Farmer Caleb ( cool, gory scene ). When Dave's ( now the scarecrow ) friend rushes to save Mary, whom the scarecrow has taken to the cornfield with the hopes of turning her into a scarecrow, he is killed and then resurrected as a scarecrow. From then on, we see a battle of the scarecrows. Mary must do whatever it takes to stop what she is witnessing. I find the acting was not bad and the killing scenes and gore were good in this film. I've seen other scarecrow killer movies and I must admit that this is the coolest looking scarecrow of them all. I bought this movie without renting it first but do not regret it. I think it's a movie at least worth renting.",1140825600,,1543,4.305841924398625
7994851,4,B0000A02XG,"This film is the second in the Scarecrow series by York Entertainment, but it is in no way a sequel to the first Scarecrow movie. In fact, the only thing that remains the same is the Scarecrow costume.

This time, the Scarecrow is in the field of Farmer Caleb, a tormented man that believes the Scarecrow killed his father 35 years before. When a couple of college kids come to steal the creature as initiation to get into a fraternity, Caleb shoots and kills one, Dave, who's spirit then enters the new Scarecrow. Bloody vengeance and murder ensues for the rest of the film.

The Scarecrow itself is very different in this film than in the pervious movie. It doesn't talk or say those witty comments, as the first one did. There's also less use of martial arts over all.

The ending is especially entertaining. Over all, a decent film to include in your horror movie fest if you're not looking for something horribly serious.",1115078400,,926,4.6

There is no plot what so ever, the acting is really bad( actors not too attractive either), you can't even make out the murder scenes, the film quality is extremely bad, digital quality is extremely bad( and i don't mean that as a matter of option, i mean its bad for anybodies standards), the music is not timed right, and just an overall disaster. Hey, I know that alot of B-Movies were bad, but I didn't think I'd ever see one this bad. So please if your looking for a good slasher flick pick something else.",1112140800,3,654,4.282258064516129

The dumb blonde girl had some really stupid lines but delivered them so sincerely, I howled.  For instance, when one of the so-called Marines says he has a bumble bee to kill the scarecrow, she lamely asks why use a bug?  Is the scarecrow allergic to bees?  Oh, my..and when the doctor at the seriously understaffed hospital offers cookies I about lost mine.  And just who is the chick the cop is in bed with?  And is his partner, Rachel, his wife?  And what happens to her?  The effects are ridiculous; the stuntman scarecrow's acrobatics are hilarious.  There is no acting at all, and poor Tony Todd's presence does nothing to legitimize this awful (but awfully funny) travesty.  I think I'll give up on these scarecrow movies now that I've been assaulted with so many bad ones.  (Jeepers Creepers is an exception).",1110758400,6,932,4.587878787878788
