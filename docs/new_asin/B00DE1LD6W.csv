5793611,5,B00DE1LD6W,"At first glance, this seems like yet another retread of the same public domain Bela Lugosi flicks that we've seen countless times.  But this DVD is only the second non DVD-R release of Lugosi's 1944 Monogram chiller ""Voodoo Man"", also starring fellow legends John Carradine and George Zucco.

This was previously only released, officially, as a Rifftrax DVD (which contained the un-Riffed film as a Bonus Feature) that, respect for the MST3K crew aside, was a real let-down for Bela Lugosi fans who have waited years for this title that was never even released on video.

Hopefully ""Return of the Ape Man"", another unreleased title starring Lugosi and Carradine, will also soon find its way to DVD.  Another great release from the wonderful folks at Legend Films!",1372636800,15,763,4.984251968503937

5793613,2,B00DE1LD6W,"I brought this to see Voodoo Man as I never managed to catch it on TV when I was a kid.  Ah, you can't go back again. The Corpse Vanishes I feel is the better of the two.  Quality is ok, nothing special.  But it was good to see old Bela again, and the drive in commercial features were fun to see.",1387238400,2,297,3.7580645161290325

5793615,3,B00DE1LD6W,"Given how unavailable on home video VOODOO MAN has been to fans of Bela Lugosi, this release could have/should have easily earned a 5 Star rating.  But pairing it with THE CORPSES VANISHES, a public domain title that dozens of video companies have already released on DVD over the years, makes this come across as a disappointing compromise not worthy of more than 3 Stars...especially considering the version of THE CORPSES VANISHES used here has such poor picture quality.  While VOODOO MAN is the best copy of the film I've seen, THE CORPSE VANISHES is murky, sometimes crops off the tops of heads, and is missing the opening Monogram Medallion logo found on previous editions.  (To date, probably the best copy of THE CORPSE VANISHES is that used by Roan, who paired the film with THE DEVIL BAT.)

The most obvious second feature to pair with VOODOO MAN would have been the equally elusive RETURN OF THE APE MAN (also from 1944, and also co-starring Bela Lugosi, George Zucco and John Carradine), but even previously unreleased fare like REVENGE OF THE ZOMBIES (with John Carradine) or VOODOO WOMAN would have been just as appropriate.  Given the demand for VOODOO MAN and RETURN OF THE APE MAN (no connection to Lugosi's earlier THE APE MAN), that double feature would have made this one of the most sought-after releases by fans of classic Poverty Row Horror.

On a more positive note, Legend has crammed a lot of goodies onto the disc.  In addition to the two features, we are treated to vintage drive-in promos, snack bar ads, trailers and a cartoon.  Hopefully future volumes in ""Legend's Drive-in Double Feature"" will see the focus on other titles that have long been missing-in-action.",1385078400,11,1696,4.844290657439446

Corpse Vanishes is classic Lugosi weirdness, but Voodoo Man gives it a run for its money.  Actually, Voodoo Man is difficult to find on dvd and is my personal favorite of the Poverty Row Lugosi films; the cast is exceptional as it also stars George Zucco and John Carradine.",1383091200,3,378,4.544117647058823

5793618,3,B00DE1LD6W,"Read G. Ratcheson's review for the best info. The only thing I'm adding is the audio for Voodoo Man is not what it should be. It sounds as though it was done in an echo chamber. Sometimes the first DVDs released by the cheap companies had an odd sound, and this is reminiscent of that.",1381363200,2,285,4.2
5793619,3,B00DE1LD6W,"I'm a Lugosi collector / completest. I already had the best prints I
was aware of on both of these, but my Voodoo Man (""Shock Therapy
Cinema"" PD edition) is pretty bad, & as Legend has a very good
reputation for a budget company (they even did the colorization of
""She"" for Kino), thought I'd give this a try.

In a nutshell, while not an awesome print, Voodoo Man is much
better than the Shock Therapy. I have not seen the Riff Tracks,
though as Legend releases those also it's likely the same print
with an added (worthless imo) Mystery Science Theater 3000
commentary track. Conversely, the print of Corpse Vanishes is
pretty bad; if you can find a factory pressed edition of the Roan
Corpse Vanishes/Devil Bat that is the way to go (though Lloyd
Kaufman is now burning current Roan output rather than pressing
& in most cases you don't find out until you get the disc delivered).

This is a dual layer (DVD9) disc, so the bit rate is respectable
(seems to average around 6) for a 2 film disc.

As far as the actual films, they're both Sam Katz Monograms (i.e.
they're both pretty dreadful), but they've got Bela! John Carradine
& George Zucco are also both in Voodoo Man.

To summarize, as of 10/13 this is the one to get for Voodoo Man,
the Roan is the one to get for Corpse Vanishes; both by a mile.",1381104000,5,1305,4.380165289256198
5793620,3,B00DE1LD6W,"One hard to find, ""The Corpse Vanishes"" and one never available till now, ""Voodoo Man"".  TCV's quality is below average along with the sound, but it is a fun throwback to Bela's good old, bad old days.  A wonderful trip down nostalgic lane.  Voodoo Man on the other hand is a surprisingly clear copy other than the occasional lines and scratches.  Sound is good to a point, but there are some moments when everything goes downhill for a moment, but then kicks in again.  This is probably due to the available elements.  For the price and if you are a Bela Lugosi fan then this is a must have.  Too bad Legend's did not give both these presentations the care that Kino has been delivering.  With Kino even the bad ones are fun to own.",1381017600,,733,4.377777777777778
5793621,4,B00DE1LD6W,"I'm a big fan of Bela Lugosi, so I'll say right up front that it's great to finally have an official release of ""Voodoo Man.""  I previously purchased a copy from Sinister Cinema, and the Legend print is much cleaner.  There are still some scratches here and there, but the overall quality is quite good.  Unfortunately, The Corpse Vanishes isn't as clear.  The opening credits are slightly blurred, and the picture remains ""soft"" for much of the film.  For a better copy of this film, I'd suggest Roan's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Horror-Classics-07-Corpse-Vanishes-The-Devil-Bat/dp/6305636419/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Horror Classics 07: Corpse Vanishes/The Devil Bat</a>, wherein you'll also find a nice clean copy of ""The Devil Bat.""

But back to this release.  I love old drive-in ads and messages, and there are plenty to be found here.  Surprisingly, the video quality of most of them is really good.  There's a Fleischer cartoon, ""Ants in the Plants,"" the quality of which is about the same as the same title on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Max-Fleischer-s-Color-Classics-Somewhere-in-Dreamland/dp/B0000687E3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Max Fleischer's Color Classics: Somewhere in Dreamland</a>--which is to say, not great but probably as good as we're likely to see on home video.

All in all, it's a very pleasant way to spend 149 minutes, especially if you have fond memories of going to the drive-in.  And the price is right; let's hope Legend Films has more such treats in store for us.",1380844800,,1594,5.977973568281938

To do so, he murders young brides, so that he can extract their bodily fluids! Pure cheeeze from start to finish, including his and her coffins for the Lorenz's slumber! VOODOO MAN is probably the best William Beaudine movie ever made. The plot, though silly, is at least serviceable. Women are vanishing along a lonely stretch of rural road. Dr. Richard Marlowe (Lugosi) is abducting these unsuspecting females, in an attempt to revive his dead wife. Marlowe employs a group of henchman, including John Carradine and George Zucco to do the dirty work. Of course, voodoo is utilized, zombie women meander around, and Zucco spouts mumbo jumbo, while wearing feathers on his head. This is glorious stuff indeed! You haven't truly lived until you've seen John Carradine banging on a bongo drum like a trained seal! Soon, black magic and mad science merge, and Bela shifts into high gear.

8592444,1,B00DE1LD6W,"The one star rating is not for the films, which I love, but for Legend's disappointing double feature DVD. For starters, the opening credits of ""The Corpse Vanishes"" are a series of freeze-frames of the film's original opening credits. I never understand why DVD companies find it necessary to do this with certain older films (VCI has been known to do this). As others have said, there are much better DVD presentations of ""The Corpse Vanishes"". This one is too soft and blurry. Sinister Cinema, and even Alpha, have better prints. Regarding the extras, the commercials and concession ads are clearly from a much later time (1950s and 1960s) than the two feature films. A vintage Max Fleischer cartoon short is the only appropriate extra on this DVD.

Now, for the more important film: ""Voodoo Man"". Legend has used the same dreadful 1948 Astor rerelease print that Rifftrax used. The Astor opening credits are terribly altered. Sinister Cinema had a beautiful Monogram print with the film's original opening credits which read: ""Monogram Pictures Corp. Presents Bela Lugosi in (disolve to) Voodoo Man featuring John Carradine George Zucco"". When Astor rereleased the film, the Monogram opening credit with Bela Lugosi's name was edited out. It begins with:"" Astor Pictures Corp. Presents Voodoo Man featuring John Carradine and George Zucco"". No mention of Bela Lugosi before the film's title which is ridiculous because he is the film's star. Astor also did away with Monogram's closing credit which had the drawing of the zombie woman laying on the floor, and the writing which reads: ""The End Monogram Pictures Corperation"". Instead, Astor used a plain black background and white letters which read: ""The End"".

On Legend's DVD, during the ""Voodoo Man"" opening credits there is a very loud scrathy noise and many white vertical lines running across the entire screen which are very annoying. The print continues to suffer from some vertical lines and other obvious print damage that it's a wonder Legend (and Rifftrax) bothered to use this print at all. It's too bad Legend couldn't have gotten better prints of these two films. The Sinister Cinema print of ""Voodoo Man"" is the one that is currently shown on many YouTube channels and the Internet Archive. For those of you who want to see the film with its original Monogram opening credits (which give Lugosi screen credit before the film's title), the original Monogram closing credit, better sound and a much better print of the film, I suggest you watch it on one of the aforementioned websites.",1419465600,2,2555,5.023584905660377
8592445,5,B00DE1LD6W,"I have not purchased but this set of the Legend's Drive In series, but I can't imagine another being timed as perfectly as this one. The cover would lead you to believe that The Voodoo Man isn't the first picture, but as timing would tell, accidental or not, it was perfect.

Why was Voodoo Man being first that big a deal with me? Because the movie starts out with a night scene of a car driving down a deserted road, in which you softly hear crickets. The sound level of those crickets were perfect for the scene. In fact, they were so perfect I was wondering for a few seconds if the crickets weren't just an added on effect by the makers of this dvd, to make the movie seem more like a drive in. It turned out it was part of the movie, but now you can understand what I mean when I say this was perfect timing to put this movie first (even though the intermission and cartoon prior to the movie had none of this. I guess it just goes to show you really pay more attention at the movie proper), when at the same time you are trying to create some illusion of being at a drive in through this set. Sure, this might had been perfectly accidental, but I must say I am in awe of that very accident.

Voodoo Man is also a pretty decent movie, one which I don't recall ever having seen, and with Bela in it, how much more drive in can you get? Before the movie starts out, you do have an intermission, something that I don't recall prior to any drive in movies I saw (I go all the way back to 1964 with drive ins), and also a cartoon, which I cannot recall before the movies either, but I would rather have this additional material, than not.

I haven't seen the 2nd movie yet, but did glance over the intermission before it (yes, two intermissions). So what happened to me in the first movie, makes me ask if the drive in 'experience' is really worth putting some more effort into. For example, should the ENTIRE MOVIE be laced with the soft sound of crickets in the background? Can you imagine? MST3K gave you the visual experience of the sit in movie, but add crickets to a drive in, and you really have something there! Maybe you could even have somebody at random walk in front of your picture with drive in condiments in their hands, or perhaps some insect fly about every once in a while?

I only mention these ideas because just seeing the intermissions on the large screen tv I have, just really starts moving me into the drive in experience alone. Also, the movie had a pretty good picture, but it was imperfect enough, such as quite a few lines at times, just to get you into it that much more. Strangely, if doing a drive experience is your main goal, it's actually preferable that the movie not be cleaned up. It would also be helpful if you have the management actually break into the last movie, in that box-on-a-window sort of sound method, to tell you the place will be closing in 15 minutes and watch for the speakers. Wow. Yes, I haven't seen the whole dvd yet, so that may be in there, but these are just a few things that occur to me.

Now for a lot of people this may not seem like such a big deal, reliving the drive in experience, but I have at least 20 of the intermissions from youtube on my computer, so I do admire their simplicity and their echoing to a place of my past, even though I mostly ignored them back in the day. So what this dvd set means to me, not even having completed it yet, is that I could had burned all my computer intermissions to disk and played them on my big screen I suppose, but instead I just watched them on my computer. So now that somebody bothered to put some on a dvd accompanied by one movie that fit in perfectly with how it was placed, I can say I love seeing those intermissions on a 42"" screen in the living room. If I knew it would have that effect on me, I would had burned the computer ones to disk a long time ago, but in a bittersweet sort of way, this worked out for the better, because I now had an opening movie which just blended in magnificently, even is it were entirely an accident. Just seeing those intermissions on a large screen, and how they're so useless for anything else other than a drive in, just makes it that much more meaningful.

You know something? If I could go back in time, and be in my car with my friends, if I were to put a measuring tape up against that window, how large would that screen had been (not that I ever got too close)? Perhaps 8""? I went and sat down in front of my 42"" screen, and from where I usually sit I am getting 5"" if measured at arm's length. If I sat closer, I would get 8"". Wow, and to think I did my first viewing in the day time. You can see where my mind is going. I'm almost getting goose bumps : )

Edited - Now that I've seen the 2nd feature, I will say it's a pretty good movie, though the visuals suffer quite a bit in comparison to The Voodoo Man. I believe somebody else already pointed out how these two movies are basically the same thing, and I agree, but in Vanishing you get to see what a Lois Lane type character goes through when there's no Superman.

Surprise, surprise, after Vanishing you really are told to put up your drive-in speakers. I hadn't noticed it before I saw the first movie, but after I was done with Vanishing I noticed the menu for the disc shows a drive-in screen with clips from the movies on it, plus it has a night background with twinkling stars; kind of nice, and definitely different. They even went through the trouble of distorting the clips visually on that drive-in screen, so as to give you something of what the movies might look like if you were viewing them from outside the place at an angle.

Spoiler alert - Both films made me laugh out loud, once apiece. In Voodoo, the man that takes on the role of our hero, comes into a room where his girl is being transformed into our mad scientist's wife. He calls out her name, and then one of the drum bangers gets up, walks over to the guy and knocks him out with one punch. The hero is slumped over on the floor, scarcely to do anything the rest of the movie - just too funny. I debate whether Vanishing's funny bit was funnier, but here goes. Our Miss-Stick-Her-Nose-Where-It-Don't-Belong (did I tell you she actually IS a reporter for a newspaper, whose boss is quite Perry White-ish?), shortly after being introduced to what would then appear to be the woman of the house, gets her smart mouth slapped into next sunday shortly afterwards. Just too funny. As many times as I have seen the Lois Lane type on film, I've just been aching for seeing that very sort of thing; way too funny.

I give this pack a 5 star largely on a pretty good job done on Voodoo's video, plus all the nice drive-in extras, plus, the remarkable timing of having the first movie with crickets in the opening scene and a bit more crickets throughout. Bela certainly adds to the score. It did occur to me that out of the horror genre, you may not meet finer gentlemen than Vincent Price and Bela Lugosi. They can suck all your brains out with a straw, and still be gentlemen about it.

Edited - I happened to stumble upon Vanishing Corpse today ay Hulu. If you follow this link http://www.hulu.com/watch/690409 and start it at the 45:15 minutes remaining (what it displays on the play line) you will have enough sufficient time to set up the slap of a Lois Lane type, which may had evaded you until now. I think I will have to see MST3K's full movie on that, but they came through nicely on the slap anyway.",1419292800,,7501,4.2531556802244035

8592447,3,B00DE1LD6W,"An odd outing with a great cast is what Voodoo Man is...unlike anything dreamed-up for  other Monogram studiio output.  Bela Lugosi is teamed with cohorts, John Carradine and George Zucco.  Bela seems to really get into this role and there is more meat here for a change.  Though he plays a villain, there's some element of pathos in his character, and sadness that this was the last of his quirky Monogram output.  Bela was at the precipice at this point with only a few more notable films after 1944, but I digress.  Bela had the best part here by far, with John Carradine only getting to play a half-wit, albeit amusing, henchman...amazing given he was only a few years removed from Grapes of Wrath and Stagecoach.  Poor Mr. Zucco gets to spout gibberish as a sort of witchdoctor(?)  and this was definitely not his finest hour.

As for the Corpse Vanishes, I was so distracted by the terrible, murky print  and atrocious audio quality, I didn't bother watching more than a few minutes.  Thank goodness I have a better print from another distributor.  But FYI, though it's been said elsewhere, Bela's wife needs injections of something from brides...blood(?) spinal fluid(?) to keep her young.  The cast populated  by a half-wit and his wacky midget brother and their creepy mom.  Dull stuff with a reporter and doctor just subtract from the fun with Bela and his nasty wife, so I'll hit fast forward at times.
