4983543,5,B006CLY3MC,"I saw Australian Pink Floyd in concert recently. At their show they were selling two DVD's, $30 each. I thought, wow, too expensive and held off. I saw the show and was blown away. What a show, what incredible energy, what music! Well no vendors after the show. I ordered both here on Amazon and could not be happier! Australian Pink Floyd is an Experience. Glad I can have such experience captured on DVD.
This collection is actually from a 2011 show and contains 2 DVDs.
A No brainer purchase if you are a fan.
(FYI... Mine played in my NTSC hardware though I didn't see any specification on DVD or packaging.)",1353283200,,612,4.473214285714286
4983544,5,B006CLY3MC,Top notch DVD for any Floyd fan. Some of the best guitar work you'll ever see. Worth every cent. Concert was as good as any I saw of the original Pink Floyd.,1340323200,9,157,3.9375
4983545,3,B006CLY3MC,"I am a hard core Pink Floyd Fan from the mid 70's. I have seen Austrailian Pink Floyd in concert before. I recieved "" Live at the Hammersmith Apollo"",yesterday[3-9-12].I could hardly wait till it arrived. I was blown away by how badly this was done. I am still in ""shock"". Camera work was excellent,lighting was awsome; But,....sound was awful. The editor should be fired!!! Guitar sound level was turned way down and so guitar solos were very hard to hear. The younger guitarist with the long hair,needs to go!{away}Everyone else did a fine job of performing Pink Floyd material. I can only imagine what it must cost to put out a DVD,....so I think this should be their ""Final Cut"".",1331337600,4,683,4.7
4983546,5,B006CLY3MC,Awesome production and sound are great. If u like Floyd Man U got to get this dude!,1410393600,,83,3.9411764705882355
4983547,5,B006CLY3MC,"What an amazing collection of musicians so meticulously performing the hits of Pink Floyd along with the same laser/light show as Pink Floyd used on their Pulse Tour! I don't get some of the M-O-R-O-N-S here bitching because it is NOT Pink Floyd!!!! Nowhere is any fraud perpetuated here, it is a tribute band PERIOD! They are coming here in October 2014 and I hope to be able to see them.",1409184000,,389,4.492957746478873
4983548,5,B006CLY3MC,Delicious and delightful.  Georgous and magnificent but not Pink Floyd.  This is an Australian Pink Floyd cover band that enjoys what they do so much that you are also forced to enjoy it.,1405209600,,187,4.636363636363637
4983549,3,B006CLY3MC,"I thought that the DVD contains a Pink Floyd concert in Austrailia.
But it is not. The group imitates the real Pink Floyd but it is worth watching their show.
They perform as good as Pink Floyd does.",1396656000,,199,4.2631578947368425
4983550,5,B006CLY3MC,This is the absolute best Blue ray DVD ever...I absolutely love it and recommend it to anyone who is a Pink Floyd Fan!!!,1389916800,,120,4.260869565217392
4983551,1,B006CLY3MC,"This is not the REAL Pink Floyd. I bought the CD. And DVD thinking it was the real Pink Floyd but it is a band that plays Pink Floyd's music. I was disappointed when I realized that it was a offshoot. I'll.give it t to the grandkids ,they probably won't notice the difference because they are under ten years old...",1385942400,,315,4.266666666666667
4983552,4,B006CLY3MC,"Very good performance, but it won't be Pink Floyd. When I bought the DVD, I thought this is a Pink Floyd performance in Australia. My mistake. However, I recommend it as a change if you are a Pink Floyd fan.",1383523200,,207,4.2
4983553,5,B006CLY3MC,"The first dvd didn't play in my player so I sent it back. The second one was the same. I bought a new
dvd player and it played but I couldn't get the sound to my stereo. I bought a dvd player/recorder,
hooked it up, tested it and it worked. What's my point? After updating my stereo equipment and
$285.00 later I got two beers and sat in the middle of my bar room and cranked it up a bit on the
the guitar solo in, TIME and realized it was totally worth it. I saw these guys in Wheeling, Wv. a few
years ago and it was like being there all over again.",1362441600,9,551,3.8421052631578947
4983554,2,B006CLY3MC,"I LOVE this product but am giving it a ""near failing"" rating because of the failure to include a lyric booklet.  Not all of us are Floyd groupies and already  have committed to memory the lyrics to the songs presented. At the cost of $44+,  I think one should expect  to receive song lyrics.  Unfortunately, the inclusion of lyrics which I took for granted is never listed as a ""special inclusion"" in the details of the description of what you are to receive in your AMAZON order...I took it for granted...shame on me.",1362441600,,518,4.526881720430108

8496478,2,B006CLY3MC,It would not work in my newer computer's windows 7 one is at home and the other is my lap top.  The only place that it did work is at work on my computer that has Vista.  Do not own a blue ray so do not know if it would even work so did not invest in one.,1420934400,,255,3.3793103448275863
8496479,5,B006CLY3MC,I never got to see Pink Floyd but I'd bet this musical tribute to their music is a close second. I did see this show this year and the DVD is a faithful preservation of that music,1418515200,,179,3.864864864864865
8496480,5,B006CLY3MC,"This ""tribute"" band was Amazing!! I looked around & saw people around me there with their grandchildren!! It takes a babyboomer to realize this. Rewind some 30+ years... you think you would  visit the best music you ever heard? I saw the Aussie Pink Floyd last year on PBS....I went & will go again...The break was interesting as the smoke had a familar smell ....now its legal !",1413072000,,379,4.573529411764706
