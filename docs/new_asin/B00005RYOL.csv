7952784,3,B00005RYOL,"Lorie Line, as always, is quite the performer and her band is as good as usual. The camera work could be much improved though, jumping between view angles too often and detracts from the enjoyment of the show.",1399420800,,209,4.526315789473684

7952787,5,B00005RYOL,"Even if you've never heard of Lorie Line, this product is worthy of your viewing pleasure if you enjoy live vocal performances.  The concert, recorded live at the State Theatre in Minneapolis Minnesota features pianist Lorie Line and her Pop Chamber Orchestra.  Some of the Christmas performances include ""Carol of the Bells"", ""O Come All Ye Faithful"", ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"", ""Jingle Bells"" and of course, ""A White Christmas"" (including a stunning bonus solo piano rendition).

In addition to the standards, there are also non-holiday tracks, including the ""Americana Folk Medley"" and a ""Latin Medley"" (which includes Marc Anthony's ""I Need to Know"", Ricky Martin's ""Livin' La Vida Loca"" coupled with ""Auld Lang Syne"").

The personal highlight for me is the emotionally charged ""On Eagle's Wings"" performed by vocalist Robert Robinson - this performance is Award Winning material.

The DVD copyright is 2001, and includes a total of 16 performances (17 chapters including the opening).  The total running time is about 1 hour and 25 minutes.  You can view the track listings using the image I uploaded to the photo gallery for this product.

Absolutely one of the best - if you love music by Linda Eder, Judy Garland, or Barbra Streisand, you'll enjoy this program.",1157328000,,1276,5.160194174757281
