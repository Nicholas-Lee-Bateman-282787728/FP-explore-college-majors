2898575,4,B000TGKJQA,"I have been a collector, of holiday movies for YEARS and Years. And this is one of the best. Please watch or purchse the Christmas Shoes first since this is part two. You won't be lost since they give FLASH backs to the first movie. But You will enjoy both and this one is a wonderful part two. I can't wait for the part 3.",1196812800,,323,3.9846153846153847
2898576,3,B000TGKJQA,"The acting was not that great and the story was thrown together. I don't understand why the writers can't just try to script it from the book. It was just too far out there. In opinion, this is a terrible sequel to The Christmas Shoes.",1196726400,22,235,4.2444444444444445

2898581,5,B000TGKJQA,"this is a wonderful movie. I loved all the actors, makes  you cry at times, what a well written show to go along with the song..Even my husband has watched it 2 times with me...He usually don't like chic flicks, but this is awesome...any guy should like it.",1194480000,3,257,4.354166666666667
2898582,3,B000TGKJQA,"Last night my sister found this at our local movie rental, and I was really excited because The Christmas Shoes broke my heart . . . in a good way. After watching this, however, all I can say is that it's interesting, enjoyable, and -- in a few places -- genuinely touching. I really wish they had done a better job with this. The plot is unfocused and flimsy. This guy Nathan (Neil Patrick Harris) loses a teenage boy on the operating table and is suddenly ready to give up his career as a doctor to return to his hometown and work in his widowed father's auto shop. To me, the motive for this sudden change was too weak. Perhaps if there had been a series of setbacks and dissapointments with his job . . . but they didn't make time for it. Soon he is attracted to a spunky young schoolteacher and starts dating her, not knowing that her health is in jeporady due to a bad liver. She is a lot like his mother was -- very compassionate, loves kids and helping people, etc; etc. His insecurities keep him from sharing with her about his decision to quit being a doctor, which causes problems in their relationship when she finds out later. Meanwhile Nathan and his dad have trouble understanding each other's needs, so there is some drama from that quarter. There are several underdeveloped and distracting sub-plots, the dialog is trite, and the scenes that were meant to be heartwarming usually get bogged down in syrip. But Neil Patrick Harris's bad acting during the last leg of the movie is the straw that breaks the cammel's back. He is able to potray Nathan as being attracted to his love interest, but he entirely fails to potray the emotions Nathan would have expirienced upon finding out she was very likely to die. There was no passion, no agony. . . just frusteration. They should have chosen a straight man for the role. I also missed the beautiful Christmas carols that were in The Christmas Shoes. The only singing in The Christmas Blessing was country music.",1193184000,45,1974,4.5322128851540615
2898593,5,B000TGKJQA,A nice Christmas movie that was enjoyed by a large group. A good buy for the price.,1501113600,,83,3.9411764705882355

2898601,5,B000TGKJQA,"This was a very beautiful movie.  The subject of the movie was phenomenal and all of the actors were extremely competent as they played their roles to perfection.  The theme song, i.e., The Christmas Blessing, was amazingly produced by the singing group.; in fact, the song was absolutely perfect for the movie as it had the perfect moniker with the same exact name as the movie plus tugged at my heart strings. Keep up the good work plus congratulations on a job well done by everyone involved plus the Hallmark Channel for sponsoring the movie.",1481587200,,546,4.7368421052631575

2898613,5,B000TGKJQA,Powerful movie about a man's mother who died years earlier and he had given her christmas shoes one year as a present only to see them being used by a family friend.

2898633,1,B000TGKJQA,"This rating reflects solely upon the actual performance of the DVD, not the quality of the actual movie. I returned it since it kept skipping and jerking during playback. I've owned hundreds of DVDs and I've never seen one function quite like this one. The actual movie is great and I'd recommend adding it to your Christmas collection.",1452384000,,336,4.810344827586207

2898636,2,B000TGKJQA,"This is p as sale but pales in comparison to the original film, Christmas Shoes. Instead of building emotion ND drama it resorts to being a overly melodramatic and predictable. The movie makers forget the first film in regards to the red shoes and some important facts about the characters. Also, they wrongly refer to Congo de Mayo as Mexican Independence Day. The film makers also wrongly cast Harris in a leading dramatic and romantic role.",1451088000,,443,4.842105263157895
2898637,4,B000TGKJQA,"Part two in a three part series also loosely connected to ""The Christmas Hope"", the others are the Christmas Wish and The Christmas Shoes, This one is very very sad, be prepared!!!",1447718400,,180,4.65625

2898640,5,B000TGKJQA,OMG!  Wonderful!,1445126400,,16,7.0
2898641,1,B000TGKJQA,"This movie was thrown together, unrealistic, and confusing. The prequel, The Christmas Shoes, was touching and overall a very good movie. However, this was NOT.

There were so many things that were unrealistic or just plain wrong. Apparently, if your child has a fatal heart disease and has been to thousands of doctors, you should make him work your odd jobs with you. Liver problems that can only be solved with a transplant apparently don't show themselves if you jog about a hundred miles a day, just if you turn in circles on a dance floor. When Nathan read the graduation card from his mother, it wasn't even her voice.

Nathan evidently underwent some massive plastic surgery, as he looks nothing like he did in the last movie when it showed him as an adult. Could they seriously not find someone more believable as the older Nathan?

And what about the dog??? They only mentioned it as one of the mother's dying commands in the previous movie, but y'know, nothing much. If this guy is so attached to these shoes (WHICH HE LEFT ON HIS MOTHER'S GRAVE BEFORE) what about this dog he wanted so badly?

The fact that everyone was dropping dead or knew someone dying was over-dramatic.

These events were crammed into a movie that seemed to span over a short period of time. How did these characters form such strong bonds?

And the one question that really needs answering: what kind of teacher IS Megan?! She teaches Spanish, but is (poorly) learning it herself the day before. She offers to tutor Charlie on math. She has students write papers on role models. Spanish teacher? Math? Writing? Maybe History? The world will never know!!

This movie is angering and depressing. Don't watch it unless you really, REALLY love poor Hallmark movies.",1439337600,,1747,4.745874587458746
2898642,1,B000TGKJQA,The DVD was all scratched up and did not work. The outside packaging was in perfect condition.,1439164800,,94,4.588235294117647

2898654,5,B000TGKJQA,Excellent movie.  I didn't realize this was the sequel to The Christmas Shoes.  I couldn't be happier with it!,1437523200,,110,4.7368421052631575
2898655,5,B000TGKJQA,I Love It Just As Much As I Loved The Christmas Shoes. This Is The Second Movie To The Christmas Shoes and There Is A Third Movie Called The Christmas Hope and That Is The Last One.,1434931200,,181,3.918918918918919
2898656,5,B000TGKJQA,"One of my ALL TIME FAVORITES, It's a hard to get movie at CHRISTmas time and it sells out quickly, if you want this very hartwarming CHRISTmas film, get it long before CHRISTmas, This is the sequel to ""The CHRISTmas Shoes"".

2898676,1,B000TGKJQA,"It isn't too terrible, but honestly, I quit watching the movie after the so-called ""Spanish teacher"" tried to speak Spanish. She pronounced ""dinero"" like how one would pronounce Robert De Niro's last name. The other thing that really got to me was that the same character stated that Cinco de Mayo was the day of Mexico's Independence. Did the writers do ANY research before they made the movie? Cinco de Mayo was a the day of the Battle of Puebla. September 16th was the day Mexico gained their independence from Spain.

Bottom line: That actress needs to actually LEARN Spanish and the writers need a world history lesson.",1417910400,,624,4.777777777777778

2898695,5,B000TGKJQA,I read a bunch of the reviews before I purchased this.  I got this because I also purchased The Christmas Shoes and this was the sequel to it.  one reviewer commented on the lack of passion between Neal Patrick Harris and Rebecca Gayheart.  I felt that their performance was appropriate for the movie they were acting in.  I was very pleased with my purchase and would recommend this movie to others.,1405728000,,400,4.591549295774648

2898720,5,B000TGKJQA,"This movie is powerful. It is great to see Rob Lowe, only I would have loved to see how his family had progressed since the Christmas Shoes. Neil Patrick Harris, is a phenomenal actor and really brings emotion into his portrayal and you also see that he does have struggles and had not entirely came to grips of losing his mom, neither has dad. I don't want to go any further because I really don't want to give anything away.

However, if you want to see the power of the Christmas Spirit and how much a child's love can power through even in tragedy, then you need to see this movie.",1388448000,,585,4.27027027027027

2898773,5,B000TGKJQA,"I cried over Christmas shoes and saw it a couple times.  Then I saw this, the sequel. I love the way they led into this movie and answered questions about the first one.  And that the two men finally knew who each other were, that was revealed in the ending was super!  My husband isn't into these type movies and he actually stayed put and watched both movies in one sitting. That really says alot about these movies as a whole.  Enjoy!  I was not the least bit disappointed at this one, it was the perfect ending to ""The Christmas Shoes"".",1291420800,,540,4.306930693069307
2898774,4,B000TGKJQA,"Based on a country music song, this story shows the parallel journeys of a workaholic husband who has lost touch with his family and a young boy's struggle to buy one last Christmas gift for his dying mother.

I cannot watch this without getting choked up.  Definitely not the usual, upbeat Christmas movie but a must see!",1273363200,,322,4.631578947368421
2898775,3,B000TGKJQA,"Amazon.com and the seller get an A+ for their service. I feel sorry, however, for the author...the movie did not come close to doing the book justice. I read the book Christmas Blessing in early December and loved it.  The story line with is sub-stories was a wonderful tale of love.  I was very disappointed in the movie.  Obviously, that is not the fault of Amazon.com or the seller. Several important themes of the book were not even touched in the movie.",1265760000,,458,4.560975609756097
2898776,5,B000TGKJQA,"My children (daughters aged 11 & 14) and I love Christmas movies.  Some of them are pretty shallow.  We were very pleasantly surprised to find Christmas Blessing.  It is warm, has a decent though somewhat contrived plot, with decent acting.  It cannot compare with It's a Wonderful Life, but few can.  We greatly enjoyed this movie.  I have not read the book, so cannot comment on others' criticism with its comparison with the book.  We are also a medical family, so enjoyed the medical aspects (this is the part that is a bit contrived, however).  I give it 5 stars because it far surpasses most of the Christmas movies we have.  We also greatly enjoyed Christmas Card.",1260835200,,671,4.666666666666667
2898777,1,B000TGKJQA,"After reading the book, this movie is such a disappointment that it isn't staying in my dvd collection.  It's one thing to edit a book down to keep the movie within time guidelines, it's another to take a movie and start snipping away characters and plots for the sake of simply making a movie version.  Why make a movie version at all if you aren't going to stick with the author's characters and plot lines.  By the time all the snipping away of characters and plot lines were done with the book, a person who read the book had to not only take a double look...but a triple and a quadruple. The movie version has so many holes, it looked like swiss cheese.  Gone was Nathan's Grandma, gone was his sister Rachel, gone was Megan's parents, gone was Charlie's mother, gone was the fact that Nathan took new red shoes to his Mom's gravesite every year, gone was the fact that Nathan's dad was fixed up with Lydia by his Mother-In-Law (whom he lived with), gone was the lady with the neon cap that Meghan raced with...and her meaning in the story, gone was the fact that Meghan was younger than Nathan...and those are just some of the holes in the swiss cheese. Nor do I remember any bar scenes in the book and I don't believe that it was necessary for that to be put in the movie when there was a wealth about Charlie's Dad from the book that could have been used to identify who he was and what he was feeling.

I am very grateful that I had read the book before I had seen this movie.  Otherwise, there is so much story and characters that I would have never known were missing....things than made added into the richness of ""The Christmas Blessing"" in the book form.  This was a cheesy, cheaply remake of a book that deserved so much more.  I can hardly believe that the author would sign her work over so that it could get so badly chopped up.

Do yourself a favor.  Buy & read the book over wasting money on this dvd...you will be rewarded with a wonderful and meaningful story, as opposed to buying a cheaply made dvd.  Usually I donate movies that I don't want to keep to the library for either their use or for their sales to buy new books.  This dvd just may go in the trash can instead of the library donation pile.",1260662400,3,2224,4.294258373205742

I would have liked this film better if Mr. Lowe had put more into it.  He seems to have very little emotion and even his expressions have little variation.  The other actors do a very good job, especially the little boy who is very good. He was very well directed and gave an outstanding performance in a role very difficult for anyone, and more so for someone so young.",1229299200,,536,4.383838383838384

The whole show takes place within a short period yet four people fall in love, a little boy wins the hearts of two people, and a liver transplant gets diagnosed, an operation takes place and a recovery all just a few weeks before Christmas.  It is not realistic at all.  The writers didn't even show time passing to make it more believable.  Also the man goes home because he decides he doesn't want to be a doctor anymore.  Well it seemed like he lived a long ways away (at least in another town). Yet when someone is sick he takes them to his hospital where he worked even though it is a life and death situation.  Also the little boy goes to the hospital to see his teacher and how does he get there?  The whole movie is like that:  very unrealistic.",1228521600,2,790,4.326530612244898

2898819,2,B000TGKJQA,"I bought this movie because I already own The Christmas Shoes, and wanted to see the sequel. This movie was disappointing to me. It was okay, but mostly it didn't have anything to do with the first one. For one thing, on the Christmas Shoes, the shoes are left on Nathan's mother's grave at the end, and yet on the Christmas Blessing they are given to Good Will on accident while the father of Nathan is cleaning out his closet. This story involves Nathan, all grown up and being a doctor.. When Nathan loses a patient on the table, he decides to go home and visit his father. He becomes involved with a woman there, and then decides not to be a doctor anymore, and lies to her about his career. The movie jumps around too much, and doesn't get you absorbed until the end. Nathan meets Rob Lowe, the man who helped him pay for the red Christmas shoes at the ending. The movie is explained kind of choppy, like this review. I guess sometimes we just have to draw our own conclusion without watching the next movie. This one was one I wish I would've missed.

It took me about 1/2 to 2/3 into the movie before I could get interested in the story. I also thought the acting seemed too scripted at times. I, however, did appreciate the message of the movie, which was to embrace life, and not let the past rule your future.
