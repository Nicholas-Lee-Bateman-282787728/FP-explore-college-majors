8407693,5,B003X3BYKG,Got the DVD and is very pleased with the workout. Bernadette is wonderful and her voice is very soothing. It is challenging though but effective. I am very glad with my purchase.,1419897600,,178,4.59375
8407694,2,B003X3BYKG,"Due to some recent injuries,I have recently purchased some Pilates style dvds,thinking they would be more gentle on my body. I just found this workout punishing-I felt a lot of tension in my neck and the excercises for the lower body just seemed uncomfortable,rather then beneficial. I also found the music so dull and Bernadette just seemed very monotone-did not feel inspired or motivated by her. I've decided to stick with my favorite toning dvds-Tracy Effinger's Squeeze&Squeeze Stronger,Tracy Anderson Mat workout and Tonique Mat.",1398470400,,535,5.380952380952381
8407695,5,B003X3BYKG,"In general, I don't like Pilates--I never really feel like I've done anything, and lying on the floor the whole time tends to make me start being lazy about the routine. However, DiGiorgi's Pilates Circle Challenge is doable and challenging. She incorporates stretching at the right moments to counterbalance the resistance moves; in addition, the circle really does help with concentration and form. She's a calming instructor with a pleasant demeanor, and the background music is calm, pleasant (classical, some new-agey but not awful, and a really cool operatic piece that I would have liked to have heard more of through the routine--and I hate opera). Anyway, I would recommend this DVD; you can do the whole routine or focus on CORE or lower body. Whatever your choice, you do feel well exercised and relaxed.",1305331200,7,815,5.044444444444444
