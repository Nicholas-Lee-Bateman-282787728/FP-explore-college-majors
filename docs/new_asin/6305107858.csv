969178,3,6305107858,"Denise is a bit annoying (""you're doing great"", over and over) and the music is surprisingly unexciting. But, I did break out in a light sweat, and got an excellent stretch, which was what I was after. She explains everything, which is why seasoned veteran excercisers pooh-poohed this video, but for someone who has never done aerobics before or someone who has only done a class or two - its a great starter tape and will get your heart going in only 40 minutes. I don't always have time for a shower so this workout got my heart going without getting extremely sweaty",1046736000,,570,4.543689320388349
969179,2,6305107858,"As a working mom, my schedule is pretty hectic.  So I need a video that gets to the point.  I found the aerobic steps complicated and silly - a little too Saturday Night Feverish for me!  And Denise is a little too  perky for my post-partum mood!  I recommend turning the volume down and  cranking up some better, livelier music to drown out her dull tunes and  ""motivational"" talk.",951696000,8,382,4.449275362318841
969180,3,6305107858,"I am a new Mom who has exercised regularly and at times quite vigorously over the years - - I found this video to be basically beginner level.  The aerobic portion is way too short at 20 minutes, as is the ab and butt  toning portion, where there are way too few reps.",923443200,7,268,4.037735849056604
7883349,4,6305107858,"I bought this video because I used a similar one right after I had my children, and recalled that I liked it.  This is a good workout for those of us who haven't worked out consistently, and still need to get those problem areas into shape.  There is also enough variation in the movements so it doesn't get stale quickly.",1354838400,,322,4.35
7883350,5,6305107858,"I actually bought this video a little over four years ago after I had my first son.  I lost all the weight remaining from my pregnancy and toned up all over, everyone commented on how nice I looked.  I recently started doing it again regularly since my second child is about to turn two and i still have 15 pounds to lose!  I feel like she is for sure going to help me reach my goal once again.  I have about ten workout dvds, and this is the one i always go back to...my absolute favorite.  The moves are easy and she always makes me smile with her comments.  Even though all these years later i can recite her whole dialogue word for word, I still don't get bored.  love denise austin!",1316217600,4,687,4.159090909090909
7883351,5,6305107858,"I hate to be shouted out when doing workout DVDs, so anything marked ""boot camp"" puts me off. This seems like it was filmed decades ago, but thats just fine by me. I struggle to get out the house since having my twins, so I sit them facing me in their bouncy chairs, and do this while they laugh at me and sometimes drift off to sleep. Denise is encouraging, and I feel fitter for doing the cardio, and I'm sure the floor exercise will start helping too, because I'm starting to find it easier.",1285027200,4,494,4.2105263157894735
7883352,5,6305107858,I bought this when my son was 2 it was VHS then. lol. I Highly recommend it! It is pretty fast moving but not so much that you feel like you can't keep up. It Really worked great for getting back in shape after my son was born. I am so excited to see it on DVD!,1262995200,4,261,3.5964912280701755
7883353,4,6305107858,"The workout seems like it might be too easy, but before you know it inches are falling off of those tough baby given spots.  Good video.",1252713600,4,136,4.230769230769231
7883354,5,6305107858,I had my second son 18 months ago and I bought this yesterday and gave it ago this morning while watching my son making a mess our family room with his toys. WOWWWW!!!!! Why didn't I find this one before????????? I felt sooo great afterwards. It is very easy to follow for beginner (like me)and you do have to be a new mom to do this aerobic (also like me). I will definitely do it everyday. Definitely recommended to all new moms and everybody who wants to loose every inch!!,1247011200,5,476,4.3
7883355,5,6305107858,"I got the VHS version of this years ago after I had my second baby. When I had my daughter in 2004 I took it out again and used it. It is the best workout for a new mom. I have to admit, I like it so much I still use it weekly even though my daughter is now 4 years old. I went and got the DVD because my VHS was in need of upgrading. No need to be a new mom to use this. It is a great every day workout and toner. Denise Austin is the BEST!",1238630400,9,441,3.42
7883356,5,6305107858,"I found this after I gave birth to my daughter. After fully commiting to workout 3 days a week with this,I lost the baby weight and then some. It took a few months,but I never felt better. I had more energy,felt firmer,and got alot of compliments on my post-baby figure. This is definitely a great place to start for all those new moms out there looking to get back into the swing of things and get their old bodies back.
In this dvd, Denise gives you a 5 minute warm up,20 minutes of fat burning aerobics with fun non complex moves that are easy to follow,15 minutes of firming and toning exercises (that really work) and a nice ten minute cool down with a little bit of yoga mixed in.
Denise is a great motivator...even when you're sweating and feeling grumpy she has a smile waiting for you to keep you going!",1174262400,7,812,4.348684210526316
7883357,5,6305107858,This DVD is excellent for post pregnancy workouts. It is a great cardio video and also has a wonderful ab workout as well. Best one I found!,1168214400,6,140,4.222222222222222
7883358,5,6305107858,"I gained 70lbs (!) with my daughter. I was paranoid that my small frame and all 110 lbs of me (at the time) wouldn't be enough. I was also young. After my daughter was born I was still about 40lbs over weight. When she was eight months old I decided to stop breast feeding (she was eating solids anyway) and decided to start working out. Bounce back after baby was the first video I bought- and I loved it! I lost 35lbs in three months and went from a size 12 to a size 5. Every time I feel my pants begin to strain, I pop in the video and work out to my heart's content. The aerobics is amazing for posture and a good rev-up in the morning. I also love the toning part in the video at the end- I do that at night to relax. I recomend this video to all moms- even those who have had cesearian sections!",1105833600,2,802,3.95679012345679
