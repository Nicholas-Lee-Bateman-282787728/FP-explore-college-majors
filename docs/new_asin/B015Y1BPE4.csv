8735074,5,B015Y1BPE4,"Roger does it yet again with his latest rendition of the iconic Pink Floyd album. I saw the live concert two seperate times and each time was simply mind blowing. The concert movie delivers the same unforgettable experience. The movie showcases Roger's concert tour along with the inner strugle of coping with love, loss and life, paying a touching tribute to love ones lost in war. An absolute must have for any Floyd fan.",1455580800,5,423,4.72972972972973
