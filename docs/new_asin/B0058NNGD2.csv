8461885,5,B0058NNGD2,"Please be aware if you buy this, it is Region 2, playable only in Great Britain! Some of the reviews of this product seem to reflect that homework was not done. I have a multi-region player, so that doesn't bother me.

Now that THAT'S out of the way, I must say how I love this series, which I saw for the first time many years ago on PBS. William and Hester are a middle-aged British couple; he works in a bank, and she's just gotten their last child out of the house. When he gets home, William just wants to have his supper and relax. but Hester is a go-getter and she's trying to find the perfect way to fill her time now that the nest is empty. She loves to cook and in the course of the series finds several cooking jobs, but of course this is a comedy and something always goes wrong.

I love this show because William and Hester look like ordinary people, not the gorgeous mannequin types you often find on television, and the humor is gentle and funny, not annoyingly big and raucous with boob jokes and insults. Plus it's obvious the couple still love each other and, offscreen, still take a great deal of delight in their private life.

The second series, FRENCH FIELDS, involves their adventures in moving to France after William takes a job with a French bank. They have to get used to the French lifestyle (especially driving on the other side of the road), a cleaning lady who doesn't speak English, a snooty British couple next door, and the local head of the neighborhood, genially portrayed by DOCTOR WHO's Nicholas Courtney. It's not quite as funny as the original, but still always good for laughs.",1500336000,,1618,4.45945945945946
