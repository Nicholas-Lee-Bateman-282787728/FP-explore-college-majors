3422469,4,B00193PUWA,I loved the ending.  The story displays an important message.  The actors are true to life.  It could happen to you.,1375488000,,116,4.428571428571429
3422470,1,B00193PUWA,Boring storyline not even worth watching for free I couldn't watch the whole movie. I could have done a better job,1372896000,,114,4.476190476190476
3422471,2,B00193PUWA,I have seen worse movies but this movie was horrible. The story line was okay and way over the top when it came to the scheme the main character was running.  The acting was mediocre and even if they had major actors/actresses...the movie still would have been boring.,1365897600,4,268,4.583333333333333
3422472,4,B00193PUWA,I like the twist in the movie as always Love conquires all. Check this movie out Its pretty good ok,1362787200,3,99,4.0
3422473,2,B00193PUWA,"Although the main character was a cutie, this movie was nothing short of bizarre. I felt like I was supposed to be high to get it. The main character has a secret that haunts him, a ""friend"" who is not quite friendly, who makes him do things he's not proud of. Only when he falls in love does he put it all in perspective. Still weird though...",1361491200,4,344,4.149253731343284
3422474,1,B00193PUWA,Enough said. I fell asleep on this one. It was confusing and the plot was corny. Don't waste your money.,1350345600,3,104,4.25
3422475,3,B00193PUWA,"Danny (if that IS your real name?) moves out west and at a bar, meets Claire, who he dates, apparently falls in love with, and then moves in to live with her and her teenage daughter.  Danny suffers from nightmares about his past, but will not discuss them with Claire.  The movie has occasional flashbacks to previous times in Danny's life and to his previous marriage that are meant to give you clues to what is going on.
The movie picks up the pace a bit midway, when a man from Danny's (Paul's) past shows up with a gun demanding 200,000 dollars.  Just about here, I thought the movie's director could have done a better job to tie things together.
The biggest hole in the story-line is when Danny, while in love and living with Claire, starts online dating with various other women.  This just does not fit in with the rest of the story or with the rather abrupt ending.
I thought the acting, except for the con man who came in well into the movie, was very good.  If you can forgive a few holes in the story, and the kind of blunt ending, you might even find the movie entertaining.",1310947200,8,1088,4.3399014778325125
3422476,2,B00193PUWA,"Divorced Danny meets Clair, a banker, in a bar. After a night of passionate lovemaking, Clair invites Danny to come live with her and her 17-year-old daughter.

But Danny has a secret and a hidden agenda. When an old acquaintance of Danny's suddenly shows up at Clair's house with a gun and a demand of $200,000, things spiral into a freak show of laughable disbelief. It's actually an insult that a storyline such as this was pawned off on theatergoers everywhere. Be glad you didn't pay to get into the theater to see this dud.

As much as I would love to expose Danny's secret, as well as Clair's foolish final decision at the end, I won't. Though it isn't hard to figure out, it wouldn't be fair of me to reveal it to those who haven't watched the movie.

Another strange part comes with the rolling of the end credits. Remarks are made that lead the viewer to believe this is a true story. I find that very hard to believe, but, alas, truth is stranger than fiction, so who knows.

The acting is very good, especially from Clair's daughter. That's the reason for the two stars. The movie moves at a snails pace for the first 30 minutes or so. After that it drags in several parts. The ridiculous climax, if you hadn't already guessed it by the time Danny's armed acquaintance enters from stage left, will leave you either shaking your head in disgust, or cursing the video store that sold or rented you this flick.

Don't purchase this dud. Wait until it hits the 50-cent rental shelf at the video store near you. Only then will the movie entertain you without leaving you feeling ripped off.",1252022400,,1597,4.493103448275862

3422488,1,B00193PUWA,"This goes on my terrible movie list! The script and the painfully scrambled plot is unbearable. They even had the nerve to end the movie with a where are they now wrap-up. If painful to watch movies are your thing, have at this one.",1450828800,,232,4.295454545454546
3422489,5,B00193PUWA,Great story.  You have to be into true drama.  This is not a movie to stimulate or excite.  The storyline is very realistic.  There are circumstances that people have to live by everyday.  May be a true story.  Glad it was shared.  Nice to know there are good people out there like Steve who tries to make things right in the end.,1446854400,,330,4.225806451612903
3422490,5,B00193PUWA,this was a good watch when there is nothing else to do,1443312000,,54,3.5833333333333335

3422492,3,B00193PUWA,I would not buy this movie.  It was an average movie but the acting was strained.  Since it was a FREE watch I have no complaints.,1439164800,,130,3.9615384615384617

3422499,1,B00193PUWA,"Not able to see content.  The movie loaded on my iPhone but once i witched to the tv only a trailer opened.
I'm very displeased that finding the free prime moves is so difficult from my TV, especially since my budget does not allow additional  purchases.",1433462400,,254,4.5
3422500,4,B00193PUWA,"Good people by choice, Bad things by chance. This last point describes the start and trajectory of this movie. In all, it was a good entertaining movie with no jarring surprises. The ending was not apparent and there were a few twists. In all, it is a decent movie. I must say that I am very hard core old fashioned and very family oriented and education oriented as well. I know movies teach, most times intentionally, no matter what entertainment goal is pursued. True love and marriage (the eternal, happy ever after) was the perspective in this movie. I really enjoyed it and it can be viewed with parents and teens without apology.",1431907200,,636,4.6371681415929205
