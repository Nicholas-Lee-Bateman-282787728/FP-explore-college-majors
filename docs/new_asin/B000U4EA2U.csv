8223569,3,B000U4EA2U,"The story (documentary) is well told but the DVD is of poor quality. It appears to be recorded from a video cassette on to the DVD and in several places the movie skips or freezes. It will continue to play, but just know there is a chance that it may do the same if you bought this item. Because we enjoyed the story itself as much as we did, we decided to keep the DVD and roll with the glitches.",1242345600,3,397,3.975
