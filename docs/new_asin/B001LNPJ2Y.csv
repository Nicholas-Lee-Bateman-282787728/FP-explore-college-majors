8319166,4,B001LNPJ2Y,"This is a well directed movie about the paranoia created by the terrorist attacks in Mumbai.

There is a Police Inspector on his night beat who is about to retire. There is a coffee vendor who makes a living on a bicycle and there is an educated youth who is paranoid about people of a particular community.

The Inspector gets ruffed up in a scuffle and the vendor, a bystander, gets hauled up. Earlier the drunken educated youth gets a late night lift home in the Inspector's police van. The vendor suffers loss of a day's earnings and is seething. And, the crowded malls in the city start to get bomb threats, all of them hoax. The city's ""no time, can't bother about trifles"" attitude has been expressed in a very subtle manner. The atmosphere is such that prejudices and ""imagined wrongs"" evaporate soon and the spirit of innate goodness and ""live and let live"" prevails.

Irfan Khan's acting is superlative. Paresh Rawal and Kay Kay Menon do more than justice to their roles.

This movie has a very positive message but is not naive in its treatment of the subject. It is quality storytelling and must be seen.",1297296000,2,1116,4.592964824120603
