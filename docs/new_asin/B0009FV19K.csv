8205693,5,B0009FV19K,"Watching my 5 year old daughter, with her guitar, singing along with Gwendolyn and knowing all the words, is enchanting and I'm so grateful to ""the Goodtime Gang"" for giving her a safe, fun and educational vehicle to explore music. We also have the CD for the car...don't be surprised if you find yourself humming the songs too.  If you haven't heard their rendition of ""Itsy Bitsy Spider"", you're really missing out!  It rocks!  BTW...my daughter gives it 1000 stars.",1157587200,,468,4.825
