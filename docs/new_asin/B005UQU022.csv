8487084,5,B005UQU022,"Good instructional DVD. Very good foundation instruction on JKD Basics. Covers Boxing, Kicking, Single Direct Attack, Attack by Combination, Progressive Indirect Attack and Distance Management.  Sifu Tackett is very clear and makes the training enjoyable.
I have trained with him in seminars and it's like having him in your home teaching you.",1389657600,2,343,5.596153846153846
