The movie begins on a city street. We hear a gunshot and a woman scream. A man falls to the floor. A woman runs from the building, and uses a pistol to hijack a car. When the driver regains consciousness the woman is gone. Jimmy McMillan returns to that ""Hamilton Shop"" and finds a body. Police Captain Jaffe gets a report from a policeman. Miss Mary Rawlins is brought in for identification and questioning. She has her aunt Maude's deed. Horace Dorn, the lawyer, is dead. Jimmy follows Mary back to her shop. We hear what Mary saw. Jimmy checks out the other shops. Captain Jaffe found out who the man in the checked suit was. One of the shop owners must be the murderer! Jimmy and Mary search the dark cellar. They find an Egyptian chest with a body in it. ""Don't move!"" says a man with a gun. Will Claude tell the police? Photographer Henry has pictures and a darkroom in his cellar.

The police are watching Mary, under suspicion. Jimmy visits another shop. That ""moderately priced"" fur coat is $3,000! One man searches for the jewelry. Next there are shots inside. A man runs out and falls to the ground. Who did it? Captain Jaffe questions each shop owner separately. Later a woman dances to phonograph music. Jimmy and Mary follow the photographer into the dark cellar. There is a scream in the night. Jimmy is struck by a club. He visits Mary, who tells what happened to her. They find a package with the aunt's jewelry and a marriage certificate. Someone else would be the co-heir. Jimmy thinks he has solved the murder now. The police arrive and take Mary in as a suspect. Jimmy finds the rest of the jewelry hidden in a store. Can he find the real killer? There is a fight in a store. Captain Jaffe returns. Jimmy explains who the killer is, and how he made fingerprints to blame a dead man.

There will be a happy ending for Mary and Jimmy, who also gets $45 to repair the damage to his car. This is an interesting story that is almost average for a mystery story. It tells about life and culture as seen by Hollywood. Its importance is the description of forging fingerprints.",1397692800,,2123,4.4524421593830334
