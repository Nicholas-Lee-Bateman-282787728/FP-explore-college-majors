3857891,3,B00274SITW,"I don't know how much of the music has been replaced (I've only checked Pants and $240 Worth of Pudding) but it's definitely jarring to not have Cannonball playing while Kerri is high-kicking or to hear Barry sound like a giant pudding clot is stuck in his throat. It's a sad commentary that such an incredible pop culture high-water mark can be scarred by the pop culture copyright tsunami. The dubbing probably won't bother somebody who has never seen the show but it may make even an infrequent 90s viewer feel that something is a little off. Surely somebody out there will compile a list of music substitutions and dialog re-recordings, but MTV already has our money and at the end of the day this is better than the tape that got eaten by my VCR.

(Edit: There's an episode I've never had on tape, that I caught maybe two or three times on MTV, and that contains the one line I've blurted out who knows how many times any time I see a bottle of rosemary - ""Ahhhh! Rosemary!"" - and the substituted muzak track prevented a moment of utter joy. The State is one of the few objects of nostalgia I've clung to and it feels like that link to the past is getting weaker while watching some of these episodes. Sigh.  In all fairness, I didn't notice any dialog re-recording in the TV Watching skit like I noticed the absence of Beck. )

(Another Edit: Yes, the replaced music can be distracting at times - it can also be barely noticeable at other times. There are only a handful of sketches which are tough to separate from their of-the-time accompaniment and a much larger percentage of pure goodness. And ,yes, the blurring can be annoying, especially when they try to block out most of a moving character's background, but that only happens once or twice. Finally, yes, the reports of dubbed lines are disturbing, but I've only noticed it in one particular character's scenes. I don't regret buying this set at all.)",1246406400,51,1917,4.550724637681159

3857916,4,B00274SITW,"Loved it then and love it now. I reference this show in daily conversation more often than I should -- too few people have a familiarity with the show. These comedians have all made names for themselves in comedy since the show's end, and this initial launchpad is a gem of an experiment.

Some of the humor in this show is not going to be everyone's cup of tea, especially if seeing it for the first time 20 years later, but most comedy is like that, and sketch comedy in particular is hit or miss even with a troupe you generally love. It is ultimately just the testing out an absurd premise, which often results in something more cringe-y than funny. I think there's still value in that, and I have found that those ""miss"" sketches are actually the ones I remember the best, because I can see the goofy humanity behind the idea. I also remember that there was a sort of deadpan anti-sarcasm happening in the 90s (not sure where it came from or whether that is the best way to characterize it, but I remember encountering it for the first time as a teenager and it really shaped my sense of humor) that is well epitomized in a few of The State's sketches.

The lack of 90's pop hits behind the sketches is a REAL detractor for these rereleased sketches; thus the 4 star review instead of 5. Something about the music apologized for the over-the top zaniness in some cases, or offset the deadpan in others. And some of the sketches flat out need the song for context. I hope to find the true originals available someday.",1473033600,,1521,4.409252669039146

3857973,5,B00274SITW,"Mid 90's show that you only get if you get it.

I grew up having the liberty to catch a few episodes of this here and there on MTV.

Later in life, I found myself to be one of the few people who would quote lines from the series.

This show to me is great.
It was way before it's time.
There are a lot of time period references, so if you're a kid who was born in the 90's you may not catch on to some of the items they're referring to as much.

All in all this is an amazing show, so much that I was so surprised when I saw the full series available on amazon.
I had to jump on the opportunity.

The only other way to obtain this show was on the xbox market place, and all they had were roughly 5 episodes.

Go for this buy!
It's amazing!

3858009,5,B00274SITW,"I was a huge fan of The State when it was on MTV. My best friend & I were in HS & I have a lot of great memories of us watching it & cracking up or even imitating some skits. I always remembered it fondly and would tell my boyfriend about it b/c he's 9 yrs younger than me & had never seen it. I actually didn't buy the DVD's when they first came out b/c I wasn't sure if I'd still be as into them. But then one day found myself on YouTube searching for skits and when I found a few of my favs(the infamous $240 worth of pudding, Doug, & randomly the commerical for ""Hits from the 70's"" where they just keep singing ""Sitting on the Dock of the Bay"" which for some reason I find hysterical), I decided I had to get the DVD's. I read a lot of the reviews which were upset about them not having the same music. And how that ""ruined"" the show. I don't agree at all. In fact I read one saying ""don't waste your $"" or something like that & a comment from someone else thanking them for warning them, & that they weren't going to buy it based on that review. That's actually what made me decide to write my own b/c how sad! That someone would miss out on something they might potentially love just b/c of another person's opinion. & I get that's alot of people's opinion(or at least that the different music lessons the quality) but I don't really agree. It's not b/c I don't care about music, I do a lot. I'm a singer/songwriter myself. But I still think The State holds up on it's own as funny even w/out most of the original music. Also a lot of ppl are saying how it's wrong of MtV not to pay for the orginial music. It seems many feel this is something that's just related to this DVD. I'm not sure if they just don't buy many other DVD's of older shows but I do & it's extremely common that most of the original music is taken out due to copyright issues. They're 2 totally different shows but I own all of ""Felcity"" and ""Party of Five"" and it's exactly the same. Neither have much of the original music. And in some parts it definitely changes the feel of the scene, esp. w/ Felicity where I discovered a lot of great music, I find myself missing songs when I re-watch it. But I def wouldn't hold that against the show or the DVD's as again this is very common. And I also still think the shows hold up as great even w/out the original music.

With The State, as I'm rewatching, overall I don't find it as hysterical as I did in HS but I think that's due to a cpl of things. One, as many have said, it was ahead of it's time so back then there was nothing like it on exactly & that was part of what made it so funny. Now there's all sorts of other funny videos or shows that make some of the outrageous skits they did look tame. But I've also discovered, or rediscovered parts I didn't even remember which I find hysterical(like Captn Monteray Jack & more-sorry if I'm spelling it wrong). Not to mention, it's totally nostalgic for me to watch & just makes me happy!

Last thing I'll mention is the Extras are really great, esp for a show that hasn't been on the air for so long. I have other DVD's from that time period w/ little to no extras. There are interviews, outtakes, & commentary for literally every episode by the cast. One of the interesting things I learned was that they actually weren't canceled by MTV as many, inclduing me, thought they'd been. They wanted them to do another season but they declined, I believe they chose to go to another network & it didn't work out.
Anyway, I would def recommend it if you were a fan. The cast are all really funny which is why many of them are still relevant. And watching the show again feels like going to see a group of old friends who could always make you laugh & cheer you up if you were in a bad mood.

It was, after all, the spring board for shows like Reno 911, Children's Hospital, and Viva Variety; movies such as Wet Hot American Summer and The Ten; and stand-up comedians Michael Ian Black, Michael Showalter, and comedic troupe Stella.

3858021,5,B00274SITW,"While MTV occasionally offers up something worth watching, seemingly by accident, there was a time when they were on a hardcore winning streak, and that was the mid '90s, when the channel rolled the dice and managed to craft a truly unique and entertaining line-up with original series like Unplugged, The Maxx and, of course, The State. Handing the keys of a nationwide sketch comedy show to a gaggle of kids just out of college, whose biggest accomplishment to that point was working on the much-forgotten, yet prescient crowdsourcing series You Wrote It, You Watch It, was an actual programming risk, unlike airing yet another Laguna Hills series.

That risk paid off though, at least for those who watched it, as The State delivered three or so seasons of sketch genius that deserved a place alongside the true legends of the genre, mostly because they were from a new generation of comedy troupes who learned from the pioneers, but wanted to blaze their own trail, a group that included The Kids in the Hall and the Upright Citizens Brigade. Taking influences from Monty Python and adding a healthy helping of pop-culture flavor, The State bent the expectations for sketch comedy and yet managed to practice the art to near perfection, until an ill-advised move away from the comfort of MTV to the more corporate, less-nurturing CBS ended their show.

From the moment the unusual theme song kicks in, with it's rough, loud ""Boys and girls...action! Action!"", you know this show is something different. Utilizing links to move from sketch to sketch, filming with a mix of multiple camera and single camera shoots and mixing longer sketches with quick bits, the show built a legitimate sense of momentum that helped the group's absurd sensibility create a show where anything truly could happen. In a single episode you could have a slapstick-style food fight, a commercial parody, a kabuki scene, talking, vengeful seamonkeys and the story of a relationship with a toothbrush. There's no such thing as the prototypical The State sketch, with only the recurring character sketches bearing any resemblance to each other (and even those are parodies of recurring characters.)

All the credit obviously goes to the troupe, who wrote and performed everything, and the talent they brought to the show is obvious in the success so many of them have had in the years since the show left the air. Considering how organic the group's origins are, with them being college pals and improv group colleagues before getting the show, the variety of styles they bring to the table is surprising, with a bit of everything amongst the 10 guys, including the overwhelmingly funny Michael Ian Black, Thomas Lennon and Ken Marino, and an unbelievably versatile and hilarious lady in Kerri Kenney-Silver. Of course, with just one female member, drag is also a big part of their arsenal, with their technique coming in somewhere between Monty Python and the Kids in the Hall, as there's not a lot of an attempt to be feminine, but the women don't tend to be as grotesque as some of the females portrayed on the Flying Circus. Truthfully, unlike SNL or many other sketch shows, there's not a weak link in the bunch, with even the lesser-known stars, like Todd Holoubek and Kevin Allison, having their moments of brilliance and overall solid performances.

With hundreds of sketches included, it's hard to pick out a handful to highlight, without leaving out a ton of great ones, so instead focusing on the genres makes sense. The recurring characters, which were mostly foisted upon the group by MTV, looking to build popular bits, actually ended up becoming popular, despite making fun of the idea of a sketch built around a catchphrase. Thus we get several segments with Louie (Marino), a guy whose sole attribute is a desire to dip his (golf) balls in various items, and announcing that desire, along with teen rebel Doug (Michael Showalter), who is unable to cope with understanding authority figures, and busts out his own exit catchphrase (which itself is parodied in a sketch.) It's amazing how many times it feels like they are trying to not make a legitimate sketch, only to create a memorable one, like ""The Animal Song,"" a bizarre musical scene, or the Barry and Levon bits, which center around $240 worth of pudding.

The show has aged surprisingly well, with bits that aren't hugely timely, though most of the MTV-focused segments, including an MTV Sports parody and several ""Free Your Mind"" commercials, may fall on the deaf ears and blind eyes of younger viewers. Making fun of talk shows, kids getting in trouble and sneakers that make piggy sounds when you step down on the heel are simply universal concepts, as is the extreme absurdism the show trades in. A commercial for cereal where everyone is at least mildly mentally retarded is an example of where this show is coming from, and that's just the first episode, as it just gets weirder from there, touching on monkey torture, dinnertime prayers for fratricide and Eastern European variety shows (the origin of the later Viva Variety series.) Having a line that's hard to cross, or no line at all, will go a long way toward helping you enjoy this series.

The DVDs
Just to start, according to The State's site, there were only three seasons on MTV, with the third being aired in two parts, but this set is broken up into four seasons. Considering the group was heavily involved with the discs, there's no reason to doubt this organization, but it is a bit weird. On the other hand, it made it easy to split the four seasons over four discs, with a fifth for more bonus material. The discs are held in a trio of black ThinPak cases, which are inside a loose-fitting slipcase that also holds a note from The State (explaining the music replacement (see The Quality for details,) and some promo inserts. The DVDs feature animated full-frame menus with options to play all the episodes, select shows, check out the bonus material and activate audio commentaries. There are no subtitles and no audio options, but closed captioning is available.

The Quality
The episodes were remastered for re-release (on iTunes first and then on DVD) and the results are clear on these full-frame transfers, especially when you compare them to other shows from the early '90s. There's an odd inconsistency to the footage though, with some scenes looking like they were shot last week, with a clean image that sports bright, appropriate color and a good level of detail, while others look like home video I shot with my old Sears shoulder-mouth camcorder, with that distinct dull, soft look that only VHS does justice to. It's not even like you can compare in-studio to location shoots, as they vary in quality no matter where they were shot. No matter what you're looking at though, there's no obvious damage or compression artifacts, though there's a bit of blurring that's distracting, as copyrights are upheld on posters and such throughout the series.

The audio is presented in pretty standard Dolby Digital 2.0 tracks that do a fine job of recreating the early-'90s basic cable sound of the series, with clean dialogue and clear music, though there's nothing dynamic about the mix.

Now, about that music replacement... When the show aired, they were free to use a wide range of music due to deals MTV had with the major labels. So there were a lot of well-known music tracks throughout the series. Those deals didn't extend to video, so most of the music had to be replaced (""The Power"" by Snap somehow slid through.) It's frequent, but, as the updates were done with the cooperation of the troupe, the creator of the rocking theme, Craig Wedren of Shudder to Think, was brought in to do fill-in tracks, and he's done an excellent job of recreating the feel of the original songs. The most memorable example of music in the series is probably the iconic use of The Breeders' ""Cannonball"" in the classic ""Pants"" sketch, but it's imitated with some heavy bass use to good effect. It's not ideal, but as noted in the packaging, the cost of the music would have prevented the DVDs from being released, and some rights were simply not available to them. The only real down note is the removal of a link sketch where the cast sang part of a Pearl Jam song, but only the most hardcore fans will miss it or notice its absence.

The Bottom Line
Incredibly, The State remains truly hilarious, even with the dual demons of timeliness and music copyrights working against it, thanks to a fantastically funny gang of creators working with a relative level of freedom. After years of hoping by fans, a complete collection of episodes has finally arrived, and it looks and sounds very nice (despite many changed music cues), while packing some impressive extras to boot. Though the music and blurs are frustrating, I can't think of anything else I could ask for in this set, aside from the CBS special, which is likely a rights issue (though aren't they all Viacom now?) As such, I feel I have to give this the highest rating possible, if only for finally fulfilling the wishes of so many. It's a fantastic walk down memory lane for longtime fans, and a chance for a new generation of fans to dip their balls in The State.",1320192000,10,9246,4.809433962264151

3858025,3,B00274SITW,"If you loved The State when it was first aired, this is probably a worthwhile purchase for you. (Would be 4 stars if not for the re-dubbing, as described below).

People have complained about the music replacement and redubs about a billion times. Well, this is a billion and one, I suppose. That being said, It's not all that bad.

For those new to the discussion, here's the long story made short: when originally aired, many of the sketches had popular songs playing in the background (some say, although I haven't been able to confirm it, at the insistence of MTV). When it came time for the DVD release, MTV didn't want to pay the royalties and therefore other music was substituted and in many cases entire sketches had to be re-recorded on audio and dubbed in.

How much is lost? To be fair, not too much. Most of the re-dubbing/insertion of new music is pretty seamless and the original material stands out just the same. That being said, there are definitely a few instances in which the comic timing is lost in the new re-dubs (the Barry and Levon sketches stand out particularly, in my opinion).

All that being said, The State, at least in my opinion, originally had a usual running ratio of 65% funny to 35% ""meh"" (that's an average, there were episodes that were funnier and episodes that were less funny). The new edits might change that to 60/40...not a big difference overall, but you might notice that one of your favorite bits doesn't work the way it used to.",1296259200,,1478,4.587121212121212

The show is a series of skits, like SNL or Mad TV, and cover a wide variety of topics, most of which have held up pretty well and aren't outdated. Even the parodies of MTV commercials are still funny. The cast is talented and people will recognize many of them from Reno 911! and I Love the 80s, as minor characters in big-budget movies, or as a guy ""messin' with Sasquach"" in a beef jerky commercial. Though it is a sketch show, the individual pieces rarely go over a couple minutes, so you aren't left cringing your way through bad sketches that go on too long. Another nice convention is how the show transitions from one sketch to the next by sending a character from the previous sketch behind or passing by the location or characters of the next sketch, which ties the show together in an odd sort of way. Actors even appear as themselves or as ""The State,"" giving a comical and skewed impression of working on a semi-successful MTV show at the time (or any time, probably).

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this compilation and I'm sure I'll pop it in now and again for a good laugh. I honestly don't understand why it took MTV 15 years to release this, or why an online petition had to be started to get them to put this together--it's hilarious, especially for those of us who grew up in the 90s.

So I was ecstatic to have the chance to own this, as I have always promised on my petitions, true to my word, I even purchased two copies to show my support. ( Though I plan to give one copy away this Christmas to a Lucky friend!!  =D )

While it's great to have the series back, the one (occasionally incredibly jarring) fault is that MTV being more interested in making money with this than releasing a high quality product forced the members of THE STATE to re-record the songs used in most of the skits as they could not get rights to the music.  Notably (and expectedly) it's hardest to deal with Barry and Levon w/o ""Sexual Healing"" and the Pants sketch without ""Cannonball"" (By the Breeders).

HOWEVER:

 The fact that it was widely reported that MTV would not pay the money for the rights to the music, despite efforts by the cast of THE STATE to have them include the music, help ease this pain as a real fan would be well aware of the issue before purchase, and a casual fan would probably not even miss the songs, as the integrity of the sketches is generally maintained.

 Additionally the DVD set comes with a note directly from the cast of THE STATE explaining that they did try to keep the sketches as exact to the original as possible, but were unsuccessful at getting MTV to purchase the Movie rights, and worked with them to re-do dialog where necessary only when there was no ability to save the original Dialog due to the change of music, or due to possibility of lawsuit that MTV would not entertain due to rare product names being mentioned.

If this were not enough the DVDs are packed with Extras such as unaired skits and outtakes, and most importantly, a DVD Commentary that REALLY does what a fan will want, they sit, and explain what they were thinking when they did their skits, so you can really get an Idea of what was happening behind the scenes, what went into the skit, and why it evolved the way it did (which includes prompts to go re-watch a skit with the original song giving the Artist and Song-title you should use! XD Very Win!) Or even references to fan-based 'homages' (to keep the fans from being sued) where the 'homage' starts the same and then builds upon the original sketch, in the case of 2-hour Coma! =D  And perhaps best of all, during one episode they make up their own Drinking game in the commentary which says you need to drink whenever they say 'drink' during the commentary track - meta funny is WIN!

Although Later series (Upright Citizens Brigade, Reno 911, Stella, etc.) all tried to re-capture the fun and frivolity of the original series, none have come very close to this, though Michael & Michael have Issues is certainly the closest to this day!

If you are a fan you will be interested in all the sketches you loved, and plenty you forgot you loved, and be able to look past the lack of memorable songs to be able to re-live the glory of the series, and laugh all over again, and although I'm not a very big commentary fan you CAN NOT MISS that wild-ride, give it a listen, have fun, and make sure to show your favorite skits to all your friends, so they will know what the hell you mean when you yell ""CHICKEN SANDWICH CARL!!"" at them during random social events! And so they can have the joy of playing a drinking game based off watching a commentary where you're told to drink over and over again! XD

IN SYNOPSYS:

 All of the DVD Sets many features, and touches of love and care all end up more than out-weighing the troubling lack of iconic music in several sketches, making this a sure-fire buy for any fan, as long as they take the time to understand the change, instead of finding out without warning on watch-through.

3858041,5,B00274SITW,"After 15 long years of teenaged-level angst, the adolescents of the 90's have finally been heard: the comedic stylings of The State finally arrive in a DVD package so good, it makes $240.00 worth of pudding seem frigid.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  So you think the world is unfair? Don't feel anyone ever listens to you? Have you been made fun of because your feet are made out of bologna sandwiches, or because you weren't gay in high school?

  Well, push all that misery aside: The State is coming to DVD. And, no, it isn't coming in a clear computer case with a black and white photocopy cover and sold from some guy's trunk. It's official, baby. Aaaaaaawwwww Yeeeeeah.

  This coming July 14th will mark the return of The State after 15 years of being copied onto VHS tapes and horribly edited YouTube videos. Even if you haven't seen these pirated pieces, I'm sure that you knew exactly what I was talking about by the time you read the intro. This is because The State is that iconic, even if it only survived three full seasons.

  For those of you that need a history lesson, The State is a comedy troupe consisting of Kevin Allison, Michael Ian Black, Robert Ben Garant, Todd Holoubek, Michael Patrick Jann, Kerri Kenney, Thomas Lennon, Joe LoTruglio, Ken Marino, Michael Showalter, and David Wain, all of whom wrote and acted in the skteches, and would have written me nasty letters if they were not included in that insanely long cast list. The State began as a college improv comedy group, and through hard work and talent, found a place on MTV, in our hearts, and eventually in Ken Marino's pants.

  The amazing thing about The State compared to most comedy sketch shows is that it did not rely on parody and satire as much as other shows did. Sure, the Sid and Nancy $7,000 Pyramid skit(season 1) and Stephen Hawking Stand-Up(unaired but on the DVD) were amazing displays of satire. However, The State brought their own quirky characters into the mix 90% of the time. Sometimes it was a humorous display of teenaged angst with Doug, or the uncomfortable display of two guys who still think it's 1973. Other times it was the self-deprecating cast disclaimers to the viewers. It could even be something so off the wall as eating Muppets. The point is that much of what the cast created was truly their own, without relying so much on current event lampooning. That is what creativity is all about: making the personally ridiculous seem funny to the general public. The State did this time and time again.

  So is it worth buying a DVD of such a show? Do these skits traverse time, or do they fall flat when they aren't cubbyholed in their generation? Yes, yes, and no. The jokes never get old to me, and because of some fancy ad-libbing on what the cast has explained in their interviews, it is because they did not rely on satirizing the times that The State can be laughed at by future generations. Even the extras are worth the time to watch. Not only do you get insight from the cast, but you get to see over 20 sketches that never made it through the editing room, and some of those were as funny as some of their best bits, no matter how short.

Some of these include:

Stephen Hawking Stand-Up
Coach Gunner
Thompson's All Weather Sealant
Krispy Pops(man on the the street)
Drag Dad
Then, of course, we have such classics as:

Sleep with The State
The State Discuss Secrets
The Boner Song

Since that time, however, I've kept up on the cast members' other works, and became a huge fan of Stella in particular.  So when The State DVD was finally released (finally!), I decided to give it a chance, and... it was not as nearly as not good as I remembered.

This is a bummer when you're anticipating ""Sexual Healing"", ""Cannonball"", or ""Suck My Kiss"" behind your favorite sketches.  Still, this box-set is a must-have for any fan of sketch comedy.  At the price it's being offered here - it's a steal!!  Buy it!  Buy it!!  YOU SHOULD REALLY BUY THIS!!!!  It'd make a great Xmas present for anyone who grew up in the 90's watching MTV.  I bet you (the person reading this review) know someone who grew up in the 90's watching MTV.  Maybe YOU grew up in the 90's watching MTV, feeling like ""Doug"" - misunderstood, but not really; oppressed, but not even.

I don't know who to blame, MTV or the stupid music labels who said NO to The STATE DVD.  You're telling me that Marvin Gaye is still under copyright?  He died in 84!

This very same thing happened to ""In Living Color"" and now all the hilarious music video skits are gone.  There should be a copywright law stating that if a show is legally aired originally, that it should be allowed to be put to DVD in it's original form.

I would have given it less stars if it wasn't for the brilliant comedic talent of The STATE crew.

Either way, Youtube is still the best place to see The STATE.

Very disappointed",1254182400,2,869,4.125
3858050,5,B00274SITW,"As a fan of Reno 911, I was told by many other fans to check out this DVD collection. Repeatedly, in fact. While I was a bit skeptical at first, I gave it a chance. After all, it came out during a period of time where MTV put out quality shows rather than umpteen reality shows about celebutants. Boy am I glad that I got this set.

Where do I start? First off, this is a sketch show, so there's not really a plotline. (Although there are characters that are recurring characters.) The show had a great cast of comedians, most of which would go on to become highly recognizable stars in their own rights. The show is surprisingly risque for the time period, with one of the sketches in the first episode poking fun at sex & masturbation. (Guess that's the nice thing about being on cable!)

You can tell that the show took place in the 90s (mostly by looking at the fabulous wardrobe), but the humor in it is pretty much timeless. I mean, who couldn't laugh at 'Old-fashioned Guy' or at Sid & Nancy appearing on a gameshow? If you can't find at least one thing to laugh at while watching this entire DVD set then the viewer must need a funny bone transplant. This stuff is comedy gold!",1254009600,,1185,4.309417040358745
3858051,3,B00274SITW,"The State was as formative an influence on my sense of humor as Douglas Adams.  One thing I loved about this show is that it always swung for the fences, resulting in sketches that vary wildly between pure brilliance and utter bewilderment.  Of course, different people find different sketches funny.  For instance, I think the Barry Lutz show sketch is the funniest 3 minutes of television in history (from the audio commentary we learn that this sketch was a last minute addition).  I still scream ""Chicken sandwich Carl!"" every once in a while to some of my puzzled interns when I'm about to ask them to do something that's beneath even an unpaid college student.  But I'm thankful for the fast forward when Porcupine Raceway comes on.

In any case, when I heard about this DVD set's upcoming release, I was thrilled.  I couldn't wait to watch the sketches on an actual television again with good sound quality and image instead of blurry YouTube videos.  When it arrived in the mail, I popped in the DVDs expecting a trip down memory lane.  I wanted everything exactly how I remembered it.

Unfortunately, in many cases, these DVDs do not deliver.  Every sketch that had licensed music has had the entire audio redone.  (I suppose the original unmixed audio tracks no longer exist.)  It is most noticeable in the ""pants"" sketch (no Cannonball!) and the Barry and Levon ""pudding"" sketch, where the comic timing is just not there anymore.

This seems like a petty complaint, but a product like this is supposed to let us ""relive the magic"" and instead, in too many of the famous sketches, the magic is just no longer there.

Thankfully, some sketches emerge unscathed.  The Barry Lutz show is untouched and still brilliant.  But it is dissapointing that given the fierce loyalty fans of The State have toward the show, that MTV couldn't shell out some extra money to purchase the proper licensing.  I would have happily paid more for this product if it meant keeping everything as it was.",1253318400,8,1990,4.752186588921282
3858052,5,B00274SITW,"The State was pure absurdist, off-the-wall brilliance.  If you enjoy Family Guy you will see here where Seth McFarlane probably got his comedic stylings from, not to mention about every other modern day wacky comedy.  Better than SNL, Mad TV or any sketch comedy show you can think of, the DVD extras are freaking great, the whole thing is just one giant trip back to my coming-of-age/back-in-the-day-era of the mid-90s, just before MTV really started going downhill.  Most of the members of this comedy troop collective are now mainstays of the modern comedic landscape.  If you know what the State is, then why haven't you bought this already?!  Two hundred - forty dollars - wortha puddin'... awwwwww yeaaaaah.  'Scuse me while I kiss the sky.",1253059200,,746,4.928
3858053,5,B00274SITW,I've been waiting for the State to come out to video/DVD since it went off the air in 1996. It brought back so many memories and it seems to have held up over the years for the most part. I highly recommend!,1252972800,,207,3.9523809523809526
3858054,4,B00274SITW,"Well, I had quite a nice compilation of The State episodes I had recorded on VHS when it aired. I edited out all the commercials and still had over 5 hours of quality scenes. I even paid to convert to DVD and gifted out to all my friends who adored the show as I did. Lots of good memories and lots of terrific skits.

So, the DVD has everything you remember. The popular skits and the smaller personal favorites. We all had our own. I haven't even had time to watch the entire set yet. My only beef, hence the four stars instead of five, is the music has changed.

Where once you'd hear a song you actually recognize, it has been oddly replaced with an acoustic version of a similar styled song. Like the ""I Love Pants"" skit, for example. It originally included a Breeders song, now it plays an odd rendition meant to mimic the original, but nowhere near the same.

Perhaps there are artist rights issues or something ...not certain, however the change in music does take away an element for me, as a State fan who has enjoyed watching poor quality VHS original skits since the show ended. For those COMPLETELY deprived of any State episodes for years, you will likely not even remember the songs that were (to me) an integral part of each skit. Thus, you may find this DVD to be a five star purchase.

Go for it. Or come on over for cocktails and we'll watch it together at my place. Swap stories about our favorite skits and characters and why. Cheers!",1252972800,,1455,4.377777777777778

Lack of original music is less jarring than I expected. But still, sorely missed. Commentaries up the wahzoo. Tons of extras. It's funny, David Wain mentions that it's 2007 when they taped their commentary. So, they were ready, but it took 2 more years to get the DVDs released.

3858070,4,B00274SITW,"I cannot give this set a 5 star review for a few reasons:
1) It is NOT worth the $79.99 List price.
Because...
2) Several scenes are re-dubbed to remove copywritten music that is playing or art that is in the background, etc. For a $79.99 list price, they should have bought the rights to this stuff. (How much can the Breeders want for the Video rights to Cannonball anyway? Go into Denny's and have them sign the release on their coffee break...)
3) It is not for everybody. If you have never seen the State before you may find this show is not for you. If you are a fan of any of the performers or the shows and projects by the same artists that came after, then definitely give it a try.

Still, I HAD to give this set at least 4 stars because: The Amazon price is much more reasonable than list, and this is REAL sketch comedy that is good, edgy, and takes risks. It is a rarity.

I haven't seen most of these shows since their original airings. I have only seen the first disk of the DVD so far, and I am not dissapointed with my purchase. There is just something about this show that makes me love it. Sketch comedy is not easy, and the 11 writers and performers of the State could have taken the SNL route and made bland uninteresting sketches for the masses with repetitive catch phrases. Their show would have had much more mass audience appeal and it might even still be running today. But it wouldn't be half as funny as what we have here.

While watching this show you get the feeling that the players were doing what made THEM laugh, and they were definitely having fun doing it. This is much more entertaining than the past 10 years of SNL or Mad TV. It is the true sign of good comedy. They take risks, are edgy without relying on a stream of profanities, and are not afraid to be just weird and stupid. Example: $240 worth of pudding. This is a Weird sketch about two guys talking to the camera about seducing and making love to $240 dollars worth of pudding. Sound Stupid? It is. Is it funny? IT IS HILARIOUS! (Note: They had to redub the soundtrack to take out the song ""Sexual Healing"", but even with the changes I was ROFL! How could they do and say that stuff with straight faces?!?)

Some of the sketches fall flat, but the show barrels on through like a freight train and just keeps on going. They just keep taking chances and there is very little of the repetitiveness you see in other sketch shows. The scene transitions are well done and they one of my favorite aspects of the show.",1250208000,,2509,4.286919831223629
3858071,5,B00274SITW,"The State was funny as hell 15 years ago, and thanks to their aversion to pop references, most of the humor has timelessly held up. The replacement music is NOT that big a deal unless you've been watching constantly for 15 years, and those of us who didn't save vcr tapes haven't. There are a few exceptions (Barry and Levon), but for the most part, force feeding Smashing Pumpkins as background music would only make the comedy feel dated (and were only used to cross promote and sell cd's in the first place).

The extras are great, most of the unaired sketches seem unaired for a reason, but it's nice to see the filtering process. The commentaries are great too, sometimes they talk over each other but that's a minimal annoyance, and it's great to hear that they still have chemistry when they interact. As a long time fan, I've been waiting for years, and this did NOT disappoint. God bless them for making it happen. LONG LIVE THE STATE!",1250035200,,944,4.552941176470588

And honestly, looking back, even going to my dodgy bootlegs I've owned for years, I can really only remember two or three mid 90's songs that where in any of the sketches...  One being the Spin Doctors song used in the first episode with the Lenny Lipton show, and then a few episodes down the road in the episode where Michael Ian Black is the guy with no pants trying to pick up chicks in a school library to the Breeders - Cannonball.  And then lastly, Sexual Healing by Marvin Gaye in ALL the Barry & Levon Sketches.  At least MTV made an attempt to replace the music with something somewhat similiar in tone and style.  This set is really really great. And it brings back ALOT of great memories for me growing up in the mid 1990's.

The real star of the show was the comedy, not the background music, so I don't know why people are so worked up about it being replaced it doesn't make me laugh any less.

The DVD presentation is very slick, with great menu screens and of course great transfers of some of my favorite sketches including:
-Blueberry Johnson
-Taco Man
-The Audition
-Monkeys Doin' It II
-USMBTRBT

The commentaries featured on all the episodes are a fun (but not essential) listen with the members appearing in different groupings of 3-5 throughout. Due to this there is a lot of repetition of stories or conjecture as to who wrote what, etc. Surprisingly, Michael Patrick Jann ends up being the most enthusiastic and entertaining of the contributing members on the commentaries.

Each disc has a series of 5-10 minute MTV backstage interviews that appear to be from the final season period of the show with Micheal Patrick Jann providing most of the group's history, while Micheal Ian Black provides goofy tours of the day to day goings on.

Also featured are 5 minute reels of outtakes from various sketches, that usually end up being more extended footage than bloopers. I found the most entertaining to be uncut footage from ""The Prom"" segment, that really shows what the whole hilarious night was like.

The un-aired sketches are many, but mostly forgettable (although they all have commentaries). Highlights include: ""Muskrats"", ""Disco Girl"" and ""Swamp Creature"". The special appearances are neat, especially seeing a young Jon Stewart stand patiently by as The State destroys his set.

There are only 2 things that could have made the set better: A then & now type documentary featuring interviews with all 11 members (including footage of their recent live reunion shows) and clips of ""You Wrote It, You Watch It"" an MTV show featuring performances by The State that the group mentions over and over again during the commentaries but provides little detail on.

I really wish I could give this 5 stars, but I have to knock a star off for the music changes.  This only affects a handful of sketches, and if you never saw the original you probably won't care.  But ""$240 Worth of Pudding"" just isn't the same without ""Sexual Healing"" in the background.

If you watched this show in the 90's, you already know it's hilarious.  Otherwise, I recommend this DVD set to anyone who likes sketch comedy shows like Mr. Show, or Kids in the Hall.  And if you're a fan of shows like Reno 911 or Stella, this is where those guys got their start, so you may want to check it out.",1247875200,2,953,4.308988764044944
3858086,5,B00274SITW,"A lot of formerly die-hard fans are suddenly waffling because some of the music was replaced.  Why?  Is it because The State is any less funny?  Or do you only find it funny because of a misplaced sense of nostalgia?

I just want to say that the music thing is jarring; however, I'd rather have the show in this format than be kept in limbo like we have for the past decade.  To those that don't know, music licensing is a HUGE expense for home video, often requiring extensive renegotiation and exorbitant fees for seconds of footage.  This is due to the original license only being set up for television broadcast as TV on DVD was almost unheard of in 1993.  You should also know that The State tried very hard to get the original music and it would have cost a fortune.  If you want to yell at somebody, yell at the lawyers in charge of licensing music for the Breeders and Marvin Gaye.

That said, The State is still hilarious.  It has moments that rival both Monty Python and Kids In The Hall.  It puts the vast majority of other US based sketch comedy to shame.  To ignore its brilliance is to deny your sense of humor.  Please... don't deny your sense of humor.",1247788800,6,1168,4.351851851851852
3858087,5,B00274SITW,"Yep, the music has been replaced, but guess what? The comedy wasn't. It's really only bothersome for like 3 sketches. So stop crying, put this in your shopping cart and be happy.  If you are really so concerned about the music, find one of the crappy 20th generation VHS copies and listen to your muddy alternative music on your ancient analogue playback device. :P  If that doesn't help, well then, get a monkey... and torture the heck out it while wearing piggy shoes on your way to the porcupine racetrack to meeta the Popea and giva him all the grapea juice!",1247616000,,562,4.554455445544554
3858088,1,B00274SITW,"I am a major fan of sketch comedy. Having been in my teen years when Saturday Night Live began and did its best work, I've remained a fan. I even made a point of visiting Second City whenever in its birthplace of Chicago and had the chance to witness some great comedic moments and stars on the rise. But even SNL has run the roller coaster route of up and down years, giving good and bad seasons.

That being said, and knowing my love for this style of comedy, I was surprised with the new release of the MTV series from the past, THE STATE. I barely remembered the series but once I began watching I recalled why. I never thought it was all that good.

As I watched each disc play I kept waiting to laugh. No joke, I never found myself even offering a grin at the items showing on the screen. Instead I watched what felt to me like people trying to be like the great sketch comedy groups that had come before and failing miserably.

For those SNL fans who stuck through the series through thick and thin (don't include me here), you know there were years when the things they did just weren't funny. Instead they either relied on using sex or drugs to shock and get an audience reaction rather than a deep rooted laugh. THE STATE doesn't even go for those that often. Instead it just offers unfunny premises or attempts at jokes that fall flat.

I witnessed characters that I could get the easiest laughs from the most juvenile of viewers. For example a party seems to be boring as all get out only to rise once the group's favorite friend shows announcing that he wants to dip his [...] (not the phrase he uses) into everything. A drink? He wants to dip into it. A bowl of something? He wants to dip into it as well. Gee, isn't that funny? I will say that his delivery of the line might be but once said the joke gets stale very quick.

Perhaps the most amazing thing about this box set is that fans have been clamoring for it for some time. Heck, who would have thought it had that many fans? Online review sites note that the most disappointing thing about the box set is that they've altered the music since no one wants to pay for the rights to the original songs used. Who would have thought the day would come when people actually missed the music on something from MTV, a channel which has all but abandoned using music.

I really wanted to like this show and this set. I went in with an open mind, especially since I didn't remember it all that well. Instead it offered a comedy show with nothing to laugh at. It felt more like a show where people tried to be funny like the originals they seemed to emulate, but fell far short.

The comedy here relies more on how loud it can be and how over the top (for the time) the group thinks they can become. Unfortunately that doesn't offer long standing comedy gems. The humor in a Jack Benny sketch can still bring a laugh today more than 50-60 years after it was first heard or seen. This group can't muster a laugh (at least from me) after less than 20,

If you consider yourself one of the fans of the series, you'll be delighter here. Not only do you get the entire series on four discs, you get commentary from the cast, some of the members on THE JON STEWART SHOW, outtakes, and more. Fans will definitely get their moneys worth. If you're not a fan, chances are you won't be converted.

I am certain dedicated fans will think I haven't just paid close enough attention. They'll talk about how I just don't get what they were trying to do. They'll talk about how the most absurd situations presented were done so by an intelligent group of people who were trying to bring new standards to a tired old form. Too bad its just not funny.

Perhaps the nice thing about this series was that is spawned the careers of many who went on to bigger and MUCH better things. Many of the casts are involved with RENO 911 in front of and behind the camera. They've been involved in writing things like NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM, BALLS OF FURY, THE PACIFIER and more. I'm sure, having listened to the extra commentaries here, that these shows hold fond memories for them. I'm sorry I can't say the same.",1247529600,12,4143,4.313624678663239
3858089,4,B00274SITW,"It has been years since I've seen The State, and the moment I saw the commercial for it on TV, I immediately ordered it. It's a great DVD set with some really worthwhile bonus features, particularly the cast commentaries.

That being said, yes, the music replacement is quite noticeable, as is the frequent and sometimes scene devastating blurring of any and all images that might require MTV to pay something for their display. The insert that comes with the DVD set claims that to include these images and songs would have cost millions and forbade the production of the DVD. I find that hard to believe.

How much is it going to cost to have a picture of Andrew Shue on a goofy homemade collage? Or some obscure album cover from 15 years ago? I can't imagine those would cost all that much. And how much can the inclusion of a handful of songs cost? Even just for those few that were played over the live performances in studio, which is where the dubbing is most noticeable (any skit performed in the studio that contains licensed music, does not have a single piece of original sound, whatsoever. It's all dubbed over with new music, generic audience laughter, and re-recorded performances by the original cast members). Pretty much every licensed song used in the show is background music with dialogue recorded over it. How, in that kind of context, is some Marvin Gaye song from 30 years ago or goofy grunge song from 1993 is going to cost ""millions"" to license? And how did songs such as ""The Power"" by Snap!, which is played over the guidance counselor sketch, make it in and all these others didn't?

I'm sure the real explanation is that MTV didn't give this DVD production any kind of budget at all, which is why we get all these alterations. I guess we should be thankful that the cast members and producers were so dedicated to the show that they took the time to find ways to get around all these inconveniences forced upon them by their stingy bosses.

It's great to see the show again and so many of my favorite skits, particularly from the first season. It's just a shame so many great parts are ruined by all the editing and audio dubbing. I consider it's 4-star rating entirely MTV's fault for being so cheap with one of its greatest shows.",1247529600,81,2261,4.561576354679803
