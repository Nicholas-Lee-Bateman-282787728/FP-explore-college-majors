2925575,2,B000UUX2ZK,The trailer is what got me to want to see this movie and I almost bought it before I saw it but THANK GOD my friend stopped me !! I won't say this movie sucked but it truly isn't something I want to waste a Saturday afternoon with. And what happened to Eddie ?? HELLO,1192924800,,267,3.8727272727272726
2925576,1,B000UUX2ZK,"Return to House On Haunted Hill:  I guess with a title like that, there probably was no possible way you could end up with a GREAT movie, but considering the filmmakers apparently had access to some pretty cool sets, a decent cinematographer, a reasonably good special effects budget for a direct to DVD release, and an attractive, competent cast, they might've ended up with an okay movie at least.  But no, this movie is just plain bad.  It is, however, mercifully short, with the actual running time minus the credits clocking in at 75 minutes or so (though if you must know, there is a post-credits sequence, which will either elate you or depress you dependent on what you thought of the movie).  The filmmakers just seem to give up at the hour mark, which results in the least suspenseful conclusion I think I've seen in any movie like this.  The only cast member to return is Jeffrey Combs and all he really does is  appear and smirk menacingly every now and then before someone gets killed.  The plot revolves around the search for an evil statue that's supposed to be in the heart of the house, the location of which is hilariously literal, and therein lies the real problem:  Incredibly bad, unbelievably lazy script.  It includes all the kinds of cliches of the horror genre the Scream movies delighted in mocking:  Minorities die first (including an offensive death by...lesbianism?), people separate from the group and go off by themselves, somebody trips while being chased, etc., etc.  Oh, I won't even go on about this movie.  It's lame. Don't watch it.  Only the least demanding of horror fans will find something to like here.",1192665600,7,1644,4.746478873239437
2925577,3,B000UUX2ZK,"Just finished watching this.  Compared to the first - it doesn't.  It is an OK movie but the acting was somewhat bad.  The ""bad"" guy tried way too hard and there were several scenes where you could see where it was ""acting"" - poor acting at that.

Some scary parts here and there, but I would not rush out to buy this or anything.  There is a hint of a 3rd installment?

Picture quality was at 3.5 in my opinion.
Sound quality was at a 4.

As for the extras, I will let someone else comment on those.",1192665600,,500,4.040816326530612
2925578,3,B000UUX2ZK,"OK, first off, Sarah was not the only survivor of that night, we also had Token. He and Sarah both made it through the door since they were not related to anyone from the original massacre, but sadly neither of them appear in this film.

Now, the movie plot was very amateurish, and the dialog was lame. Most of the effects were CGI including some very bad kills. Nothing new to see here and I would suggest you watch this only if there is nothing left at the rental house. The running time of the actual movie sans credits is about 1 hour 15 minutes.

I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED!",1192579200,7,577,4.284403669724771
2925579,3,B000UUX2ZK,"I keep reading the reviews posted here and everyone keeps saying Sarah was the only survivor. Maybe all of you have a different version of the movie, mine shows her AND Eddie Baker on the ledge at the end. Did she push him off the ledge? I hope your reviews on the sequel are more accurate",1192579200,21,289,4.178571428571429
2925580,2,B000UUX2ZK,"This was a major disappointment! I loved the first one 'House on Haunted Hill' and was eager to see this sequel, but alas, it ended up being quite dull and uninspired. The acting was just awful, especially the girl who played Ariel...good grief, show some emotion girl! Even in the scene where she finds out her sister is dead, her grief seemed incredibly understated, practically non-existent! I wil admit that the effects were decent for a straight to DVD, but the plot was predictable and just plain silly at times. When they reached the ""heart"" of the house where the idol was located, the plot ventured into the ridiculous and I couldn't stop laughing at the stupidity of it all. I don't think I would care to see this again, it only made me long to see the original House on Haunted Hill which is light years better than this snoozefest.",1192579200,11,843,4.589403973509934
2925581,4,B000UUX2ZK,"OK, just by the title, and the fact that it's a dark castle film makes the viewer kind of chuckle a little. Well this does have some moments that are quite laughable (in the sense of bad acting). However, this movie does have some genuinely creepy moments (the hydrotherapy scene was awesome) and the gore is out of this world for a DTV horror movie. There is lots of continuity errors from the first film to this, and to even think that this bares a connection to the original House on Haunted Hill is absurd b/c all of the original plot/references have been lost. But honestly, its not that bad, its even worth buying because the death scenes are really cool, and the ghouls look awesome. Oh and about all those reviews saying the 'wet tshirt' , she may as well have been wearing a sweater.",1192492800,2,792,4.431506849315069
2925582,3,B000UUX2ZK,"The House on Haunted Hill remake was enjoyablable to me mainly because of Geoffrey Rush. I thought he carried that movie. As most straight to DVD horror sequals go, this is just milking a name and adding some gore and nudity. The 'plot' slightly reminds me of Indiana Jones. We have a professor who wants an artifact for a museum and we have some biceps hired by a collector to find it. Skip about the first 20 minutes, sure you'll miss a forced boob shot but this movie is clearly all about the death scenes. I did have to turn my head a couple times. I'm a girl when it comes that though. It's worth a drunken rental. I've seen much worse. Stay until the end of the credits if you want to dread/hope for a trilogy (or if you just want another boob shot.)",1192147200,,756,4.220689655172414
2925583,2,B000UUX2ZK,"The best part of this movie is Amanda Righetti wears semi wet-shirt majority of the movie.  She would constantly get wet for no appearant reasons... and that alone is worth 2 start imo :)

Otherwise, this is movie isn't worth about 1/2 a start.  It has lots of unnecessary gross scenes.  The ghosts this time seem like they want to make their vitims suffer what they suffered in the past.  And there are lots of victims this time around.  The problem is you wouldn't know or care majority of the characters.  There's also almost no plot at all.  Most of it just involves setting up who will die next.

Overall, like many horror sequel, the original remake was much much better and there's really no reason for this piece of mess.  This is just more gross, not scary at all.  I cheered every time I seen Amanda Righetti's wet t-shirt back on sense.  If that's not your thing, skip it.",1191715200,8,883,4.45

There are moments of the film where the characters are supposedly in fear of their lives yet are walking so slow and spouting words of love for one another? How about this scene....two people with machine guns fire at a solid steel mechanism  larger than a car and not a bullet ricochets back at them? And the mechanism dutifully shuts down due to this?

2925602,3,B000UUX2ZK,"Once more, an intrepid band of bad (and good guys) enters the house on haunted hill.  This time there is no party and no reward unless you count a creepy idol hidden deep in the bowels of this hell hole.  A murderous scoundrel (Erik Palladino as Desmond Niles) kidnaps a couple and ""encourages"" them to join his crew on the treasure hunt inside the ill-fated asylum.  The only flaw in his plan is the ""scientific"" team already on site also looking for the mysterious idol.  With a little persuasion, everyone splits up and starts rummaging.  At least the ghosts enjoyed having new playmates to torment.  Soon the party dwindles to an unlucky few.

Well under 90 minutes, this shock(less)-fest moves rapidly but doesn't do anything significantly different than most horror flicks of this type.  The formula is stock: lock a group in a building then kill them one by one.  Jeffrey Combs offers up his presence but really doesn't do anything except show up from time to time.

2925610,3,B000UUX2ZK,"A very average sequel no Doubt about it
this is the sequel the Hugely succesfull 1999 Horror classic HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL
which obviously was brilliantly Directed by William malone and brilliantly written by Dick Beebe

but for this sequel
the script is very ridiculous and the Acting is tolerable
there's still some suspense and Horror in the script so the film is not totally terrible
the plot is about an Art Dealer Desmond niles and Archaeologist that are trying to get an Ancient Artifact
Desmond knows about sara's sister Ariel, (Sara who was the last survivor from the 1999 film)
Desmond steals Ariel to get this ancient artifact
that has been locked away somewhere in Vannacutt Psychiatrict institute for the criminally insane
also known as the House on Haunted Hill
this Artifact turns out to be the power source feeding the Evil spirits in the Asylum
so Ariel wants to Destroy the Artifact to free the souls
that is basically the plot, pretty stupid storyline that runs for 70mins and then the credits roll
Jeffrey combs reprises his role as Dr. Vannacutt, and excellent performance by Jeffrey i must say
he has no Dialogue in the film but his presence as the sadistic psychiatrist is brilliantly Actored

apart from the very stupid storyline
the only Highlights are the special make-up blood & Gore effects of the walking Corpses
and the Psychotic patients that have been operated on by Dr. Vannacutt
 and the Visual effects of the Ghosts aswell
and the major Highlight is Jeffrey combs returning as sadistic Psychiatrist Dr. Vannacutt
this blu-ray release has the UNRATED cut which has extra Gore scenes
one of these scenes has Dr. Vannacutt removing a brain from a patient
and you see the whole operation in Graphic detail
and many more scenes like it in Graphic Gore detail

there is only a few special features, little featurettes
the first is Character Confessions Gallery goes for about 15mins
most of the main Actors from the film are interviewed about their Characters in the film
but they talk about their character from their Character point of view
as if the Actors are in characters when being interviewed, it's bizzare i couldn't see the point of it.
the 2nd featurette is Search for an Idol
an interview with Steven pacey who plays Dr Richard Hammer
you also get some additional scenes that were cut from the theatrical version

this sequel did not get a Theatrical run, the film went direct to DVD
which i am not surprised, the script writing and the Acting is very average
as i said the only Highlights in this sequel
are the special effects make-up & special visual effects
plus Jeffrey combs reprising his role as Dr. Vannacutt

i gave this sequel 3 stars meaning it's okay, tolerable to watch i wouldn't watch it more than a couple times if that
mainly cause of the very ridiculous storyline plus some of the Acting is ridiculous to
where is the 1999 version is extremely well actored plus the special make up effects done in the 1999 one
is by KNB special effect team",1418083200,,2999,4.735632183908046

I enjoyed the original House on Haunted Hill movie, but the Return to House on Haunted Hill the sequel leaves a lot to be desired. The death scenes are down right silly at best.

Though littered with the ever annoying TWITCHY CAM and eye-rolling speed cuts, it still manages to be a pretty good horror film.  It could have used more atmosphere and you would think being in a creepy asylum, you'd get that but they chose screechy sounds and speed cuts to try ""thrill"" you and it gets a bit annoying.

 This film could have been more, but like i said it tries too hard with the noise and camera twitching, some generally average CGI and almost annoying ""talkin' s***"" that it bogs it down a bit.  The bonuses are pathetic - instead of doing some interesting making of or interviews, they try to do this silly reality TV ""confessions"" which is nothing more than more of that annoying banter.

 Still i found that it still delivered even with these, no where near as cool as the first but still holds up enough for some decent kills and Jeffery Combs and Creepy Asylum goodness.",1394841600,,968,4.497142857142857

Maybe it was the way that you never knew what new horror was lurking around the next corner, maybe it was seeing the evil spirit of the deranged doctor getting attacked by his tormented victims.

2925633,3,B000UUX2ZK,"It's been a while since Sid dropped a horror review so why not go with a straight to video sequel? The first House on Haunted Hill starred Chris Kattan and Taye Diggs which seemed like it really scraped the bottom of the barrel. However the much more b sequel topped that cast with horror b queen Cerina Vincent. Anything she's in will ultimately lower your standards for the flick and you'll wind up enjoying it. It falls into that our favorite category of ""so bad it's good.""

The film revolves around the recent suicide of Sarah Wolfe who was the sole survivor from the murders that took place at the Vanacutt Mansion. For some time she tried to explain how ghosts were responsible for the murders that took place but nobody would believe her. Somehow Sarah got her hands on the secret diary of Dr. Vanacutt and winds up sending it to her sister Ariel. Once she recieves the diary a group kidnaps her and forces her alog with others into the mansion in hopes of finding a very valuable statue. Once inside the spirits begin to reek havoc on all leaving escape a very unlikely option.

Overall the film was pretty enjoyable. There were a few creepy moments courtesy of some strange looking ghosts. The film moved along pretty quick which is always good when dealing with b horror. If it lasts too long it will tend to just get boring, but this one just got by in that department. We wouldn't recommend buying it but if it's on late one night and you have and hour & a half to kill it's worth checking out.",1238716800,,1507,4.436823104693141
2925634,4,B000UUX2ZK,"In my opinion, ""Return To House On Haunted Hill"" was a very good sequel to ""House On Haunted Hill"" (although it would have been better if one or both or the survivors from the first movie had been in this).

It is gory, suspeceful, and has mostly origional deaths - what more could you want from this type of movie? There were a lot more people in the house this time than in the first (about 10) so there is a higher body count, too.

Althought there is quite a lot of gore in this movie (a lot more than in the first movie) it wasn't as gory or over the top as most people were suggesting. But the best thing about the movie I thought was that, while most horror movies either concentrate on either being suspenceful and creepy, or on being violent and bloody, this movie had both gory deaths and suspenceful scenes, so you get the best of both worlds.

Overall a very good sequel, which I'm sure fans of the first movie will enjoy. After seeing this I'm certainly hoping that there will be a third movie in the series.",1237593600,6,1021,4.252577319587629
2925635,2,B000UUX2ZK,"It seems as though creating a horror movie with actual suspense and chills has become a lost art. They all seem to be filled with horrible actors playing unlikable poseurs mailing in their performance of the lousy script. This is certainly true of this film. There is a dark, creepy mansion with cobwebs but the movie is just a flat and boring mess. There never seems to be enough of a build up before someone meets their gruesome demise. It's just ""Splatter...Next"". The editor of the film seems to have put the most effort into trying to salvage it with all the rapid montage cuts, jump edits, and black and white flashbacks, but I thought he might have overdone it a bit after my fourth epileptic seizure. The special effects were decent for the most part, but they shouldn't rely on effects, blood & gore, and topless lesbians making out to keep the viewer's attention. As long as people keep giving this garbage 5 stars the studios will keep churning it out. The special features have some confessional nonsense with the ""actors"" just in case you weren't already sick of them.

The director decides to have a group of people (some forced into going) go out and retrieve a valuable statue from the sanitarium that poses' evil.  Basically in this film it ends up being the people who want the statue vs the people who were forced into the sanitarium by the people who don't want to leave the sanitarium with out the statue and really just want to get out of the mess alive.

Wow!! This is one of those sequels that fully justify its existence. Kind of rare in some forms of Horror, and not what I was expecting in the HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL style. About all I missed in this film was the very stylised jerky ghost moves that characterised the first film. Whilst the Barebones structure of the plot of the search for the Statue, the Quest of Dr Richard Hammer, holds the film together, the carefully detailed death scenes spook the daylights out of anyone watching.

2925646,2,B000UUX2ZK,"""Return to House on Haunted Hill,"" sequel to ""House on Haunted Hill"" made (or remade) in 1999, has decent production designs and photography, but ultimately doesn't have enough narrative skills to interest us throughout the entire film. Like the 1999 original, the new film has a lot of effects including gores (including the gory one of the ""operation"" scene which Jigsaw might love to see). I don't hate seeing them at all, but its boring story is another thing.

In ""Return to House on Haunted Hill"" we see yet again characters trapped in the abandoned asylum ""the Vanacutt Mansion"" for the most unconvincing reasons - treasure hunting. Ariel Wolfe, fashion magazine editor and sister of Sarah, one of the survivors of the incident seen in the previous film, is kidnapped and forced to enter this dilapidated building where ghosts seem still roaming. Unfortunately you don't see Ali Larter or Jeffrey Rush here (though Jeffrey Combs reprises his role as the doctor). Amanda Righetti plays Ariel and she is not bad.

Anyway, you will see Ariel and other characters including mercenaries, a professor and his assistant looking for a relic, etc, and some of them picked off one by one when they (unaccountably) refuse to stick together, according to the genre's tired clich. This is where we need a better script because once they are locked in, we have to wait for the scary and gory moments to come, which somehow include lesbianism and nudity. It seems the characters don't know what they really want to do, getting out or staying in, but even these ghosts don't know what they are supposed to do.",1196208000,3,1600,4.857142857142857

2925648,2,B000UUX2ZK,"1999's ""House on Haunted Hill"" was released about two months after ""The Haunting"" which had a far bigger budget and received much more publicity. Despite that, ""House on Haunted Hill"" proved to be the superior film with much more atmosphere and scares and less of a reliance on CGI effects. Only two of the guests at Hill House managed to escape with their lives, one of those being Sara Wolfe (Ali Larter). Unfortunately The gorgeous Ms. Larter is not around for the sequel, only in character name. Sarah's sister Ariel is an exec with a magazine and learns the news that Sarah has committed suicide. Ariel is visited by an archaeologist looking for the Statue of Baphomet, an evil artifact worshipped by a cult in the middle ages. He believes the statue is located inside of Hill House and is looking for the Journal of Dr. Vannacutt, the doctor who ran the asylum.

A group of thieves led by Desmond (Eric Palladino) are also looking for the rare statue and they take Ariel and her boyfriend, Paul, hostage. Now the archaeologists and his assistants (Michelle & Kyle) along with the gang of thieves, Ariel and all find themselves locked inside the monstrous house/asylum, searching for the statue while the spirits of the house begin hunting them down one-by-one. Naturally this comes about as they devise the wise strategy of splitting up to search for the statue. Even when one of his men is torn to pieces, Desmond still refuses to believe in the house's haunted reputation.

The 1999 film wasn't great, but it had a creepy atmosphere that the sequel lacks. This film is much more visceral and in your face and far more gory. Some of the gore hound scenes include on of the thieves getting torn apart limb from limb and another having her face literally removed with a scalpel. Not subtle, but fairly effective.

The cast is no comparison to the first film. That film had well known actors like Larter, Geoffrey Rush, Famke Janssen, and Taye Diggs...The most recognized name in the sequel is low-budget horror king Jeffrey Combs who reprises his role as Dr. Vannacutt and has exactly one word of dialogue in the entire film. On the plus side, Amanda Righetti (Ariel) and Cerina Vincent (Michelle) are great eye candy.

The entire premise of the Baphomet statue is a little ridiculous. The ghosts in the first film killed the guests because they were all descendants of the staff that worked at the asylum. What their motivation here is anybody's guess although there is at least one who tries to help Ariel. The remaining survivors eventually figure they can escape through the asylum's sewer system and conveniently find the blueprints to the mammoth facility and evidently Ariel is an engineer as she is able to map out their entire route down to the basement and into the sewer grates...ok....

Return to the House on Haunted Hill isn't a bad film, it's just not great. But there's some decent scares and gore and its worth a rent.

2925649,3,B000UUX2ZK,"this movie was okay. it had a good chance to be really good being a second part and all, but they just let it flop. it seems they really didn't give it any thought. the return to house on haunted hill, should have been more than what it came out to be. the first part was really good and the creep factor was high. in big part to the actors, especially geoffrey rush and chris kattan. so i was expecting this one to be at least around the first ones level, but no. at first it was a little hard to try to really get into. the actors just weren't believable enough, and they were just throwin the lines out there like nothing. it was all played out. in this one, it's the return to the house, so they have to go back. well, forced to go back. though nobody believes in the stories of ghosts, and evil spirits lurking around in there. even though sarah(a survivor of the first film)has told her sister ariel all about the house and the evil dr. vannacutt she didn't believe her. there was no contact between sisters. the reason being sarah couldn't get over her experience at the house on haunted hill, and ariel just didn't believe it. until sarah committed suicide, or so they thought, but it wasn't so, she was murdered.  the same people come after ariel, thinking she knows whatever her sister knew. so the no goods take her hostage back to the house. looking for an artifact. only dr. vannacutts diary knows where it is located, so they begin the hunt, only to be hunted. when there they bump into others looking for the same thing as well. once you're in there's no way out. all to soon, they find out one by one that the evil that was talked about is very real. they must destroy the artifact to rid the house of evil.  setting all the spirits free, and dr. vannacutt strait to hell.  so it's up to ariel to save the day and make it out alive, and in the process realize that her sister was never wrong. the story of the movie was weak, some of the actors were dragging at first, then towards the middle they got on cue. i loved all the gory scenes. the killings went hard and that's the main reason i liked it, and the fact that it showed a bit more about the victims. all around it was alright.",1193961600,,2201,4.235714285714286
2925650,3,B000UUX2ZK,Let me start by saying the first was much better but this one is not to bad. If you can get past how they threw the cast into this house it gets a little bit easier after that. They kidnap the sister from the first survivor to help find a statue that is worth a lot of money to collectors but is supposely connected to the house and its power. After that it gets better with all the effects and gore. Plus they don't drag it on to long which really helps. Over all its worth a rent.,1193702400,,482,3.9285714285714284

2925652,3,B000UUX2ZK,"I am glad that the ghost characters from the earlier film were explored further in this sequel.  I never completely embraced the concept of what looked like a misty Rorschach Test enveloping and destroying characters in Dark Castle's first ""Haunted Hill"" venture.

The role of the doctor (expertly played by Jeffrey Combs) is sufficiently eerie and he's given more to do in this film.  Throw in his supernatural victims from years past and you have a great haunted house!

Granted, the acting in this film is mostly sub-par, save for the lead actress (Righetti) and Andrew Lee Potts who provides comedic relief.  Also, the kills are creative enough to keep die-hard horror fans entertained.  And the DVD's extras are fun to watch, probably to make up for the film's short length.

If Warner decides to cultivate its storehouse of horror remakes and make direct-to-video sequels, so be it.  I would look forward to another ""Thirteen Ghosts"" film or ""House of Wax"" chapter.",1193011200,2,971,4.950617283950617
2925653,1,B000UUX2ZK,"It's pretty much a given not to expect anything relatively special out of a direct to DVD horror sequel, but Return to House on Haunted Hill is so bad that you'll wish it had never been released it all on any format whatsoever.  The movie picks up with Ariel (Amanda Righetti), the sister of survivor Sara (Ali Larter, who is not here, but played the part in the first film, which was a 1999 remake that was a surprisingly enjoyable guilty pleasure), getting news of her sister's suicide, and thus embarks on a trip to said house to learn the truth behind her sister losing her mind, or something to that effect, maybe.  The storyline doesn't exactly make sense (you may remember that Sara wasn't the only survivor of the house, and she did make off with a good deal of cash), but that's not why we're here.  We are here to be thrilled and chilled, and Return to House on Haunted Hill does quite little in both departments.  There are some moments of blood letting, but the CGI generated gore effects are laughable, and the overall film is a quick running yawn-fest.  Modern B-movie horror queen Cerina Vincent is here, as is the great Jeffrey Combs (Re-Animator, From Beyond) who returns as the evil, ghastly doctor of said house, but he's hardly around to elevate this crud pile any higher.  No matter how much of a fan you are of the 1999 remake that spawned this direct to DVD sequel, do yourself a favor and avoid it at all costs.",1192924800,9,1435,4.478927203065134

8215023,2,B000UUX2ZK,"RELEASED TO VIDEO IN 2007 and directed by Vctor Garca, Return to House on Haunted Hill chronicles events when two factions enter the odd house on the cliffside (actually an asylum) looking for a satanic idol on the very same night (!). One party consists of Ariel (Amanda Righetti) & her beau (Tom Riley) who had been kidnapped by a group of thugs looking for the priceless figurine (e.g. Erik Palladino & Calita Rainford). The other party consists of a college professor (Steven Pacey) and his student assistants (Andrew-Lee Potts & Cerina Vincent). Needless to say, all hell (literally) breaks loose.  Jeffrey Combs is on hand as the houses resident mad doctor, Richard B. Vannacutt.

This is a stand-alone sequel to the 1999 movie, House on Haunted Hill, which I don't remember seeing, but I have seen the lame original 1959 film with Vincent Price. In any case, this sequel curiously adds the priceless Baphomet idol as the cause of Dr. Vannacutt's evil. It's an arbitrary plot device to get people back in the house and paves the way for subplots about suicides and gangsters, which are incongruent to the original films simple premise (daring a group of strangers to stay in the house overnight for a million dollars).

But does anyone really care about that in a direct-to-DVD stand-alone sequel? Not me. The question is: Does Return deliver as a competent haunted asylum flick? Palladino makes for a capable villain, the storys energetic, the asylum sets & CGI are creepily effective and theres a lot of gore. But I didn't care a wit about anyone who was threatened because the movie never took the time to establish characters for which the viewer might care. This is augmented by the fact that the bulk of the people are awfully unlikable, which destroys sympathy. There was no suspense or genuine scares. In one sequence, for instance, a man is literally drawn & quartered to bloody pieces and I busted out laughing.

Also, for me, the film didn't deliver on the female front. Protagonist Righetti is decent, but comes across as a Grade-B Kate Beckinsale. Cerina Vincent is certainly one of the most voluptuously beautiful women to walk the planet, as seen in It Waits (2005) and Sasquatch Mountain (2006), but here shes painfully anorexic and in dire need of eating at McDonalds for four weeks straight. Calita Rainford is serviceable, but not enough is done with her and she doesnt last long anyway. There are a couple of fine-looking ghosts, however, in a lame wannabe-edgy lesbian sequence.

The flicks just too by-the-numbers conventional, as far as modern horror goes, and evidently aimed at adolescent boys. Theres no sense of artistry. If you want to see a haunted asylum film that balances conventional horror with kinetic editing & effects with an awesome sense of artistry, see 2005s Death Tunnel (and, no, Im not kidding; see my review for details).
