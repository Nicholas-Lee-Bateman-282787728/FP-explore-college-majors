4507188,5,B004ZBA9P6,"I believe that the critics were all wrong about ""Mars Needs Moms"". My four year old granddaughter and I enjoyed it thoroughly. It was cute, colorful, funny, and very entertaining. We both smiled and laughed all the way through. Plus the main characters were warm, loyal, resourceful, and caring--good role models for the little ones. I intend to buy it as soon as it comes out in DVD so that my granddaughter and I can enjoy it all over again!",1302998400,59,443,4.55
4507189,5,B004ZBA9P6,"""Mars Needs Moms"" relates the adventures of Milo, a boy who seeks to rescue his kidnapped mother from Martians .  Based on a children's book by the famous comic strip author Berkeley Breathed, this animated film, while uneven in certain respects, excels in its depiction of sacrificial family love.  Milo is truly heroic in his single-minded determination to free his mother despite insurmountable odds and even a powerful temptation to give up.  I also found the Martian settings to be artistically imaginative, fascinating, and impressive.

The film's portrayal of the relationship between an American mother and her son was not only realistic but profoundly moving.  Young Milo attempts to deceive his mother.  Like all good mothers, she catches him out and holds him accountable.  Like all disobedient children (which covers most of the human race at one time or another), Milo angrily lashes out at her.  In a moment that rings true with my own childhood and with our own children on occasion, Milo's mother is reduced to tears by her son's cruel words.  Milo tries to go to sleep but the guilt over his response to his mother troubles him.  He gets up to apologize, only to discover that he is, in one sense, too late.  His mother has disappeared.  In another sense, he arrives in the nick of time, just able to follow after the strange beings who have kidnapped his mother.  Love for his mother stoked by his remorse for his meanness fuel an unquenchable determination in Milo to rescue her.  Within a fast-paced, wildly fantastic and carelessly implausible animated movie, this true-to-life family relationship comes as somewhat of a surprise.  But the film succeeds brilliantly because the filmmakers remain true throughout to the theme of love between a mother and son.

Milo's mother has been kidnapped by a radical feminist Martian society that has all but destroyed maternal love in its elevation of power and technological progress.  The Martians abandon their males at their planetary dump and leave their females to be raised by robot nursemaids.  But little ones, even in a twisted society, need more than a robot to be cared for properly.  Presumably unable and/or unwilling to provide quality maternal nature themselves, the Martian supervisors spy out likely outstanding mothers on planet Earth and kidnap the best candidates in an evil plan to enrich the maternal behavior of the robots.

In his quest, Milo meets Gribble, a fellow human stranded on Mars with his own tragic story and Ki, the Martian who has rebelled against the oppressive Martian society.  The events that bring Milo and his new friends to the film's final climax uncover Mars' own dark secrets about motherhood and the family.

It is unfortunate that ""Mars Needs Moms"" was a dismal flop at the box office.  The film's odd mix of a relatively serious theme in a wacky action-adventure animation vehicle may have hurt its reach.  Some may have been repelled by its central theme of the importance of motherhood and the natural family.  Surveys at a leading film website indicate that this film splits its audience, with people either loving or hating ""Mars Needs Moms,"" with relatively few in between.  Such a divergence indicates that people's fundamental views on life dictated their response to the film, not less weighty matters such as the animation style, humor, music, or plot devices.

It is my hope that the mostly brilliant folks at Disney made a few marketing errors and missed their target audience.  If you believe that the natural human family is a fundamental, even divinely ordained social unit with motherhood being one of its key components, please give this film and the dvd a chance.  You may find yourself not only entertained, but surprisingly moved.",1302998400,23,3761,4.991974317817014
4507190,1,B004ZBA9P6,"As you would expect there are aliens in Mars Needs Moms, and they speak Martian. The makers of this wretched film saw no need to translate and, to be fair, nor is there any: no matter how incoherent their gibberish is, you don't need to understand it to get the gist, and to try to would be to miss the point.

And that about sums up this film: that it is largely incoherent makes no odds; so diligently is it structured by rote you know exactly what is going on, how it will end and each of the Stations of the Cross you'll pass through on the miserable journey that is sitting through it.

Usually, I like bad films. There's a voyeuristic pleasure in observing public displays of ineptitude. It's fun reviewing them. It's challenging trying to unpick what went wrong. Badness, in its way, can be entertaining and stimulating. But not with this picture.

There is much to admire but nothing at all to like about Mars Needs Moms.

There undoubted artisanship (some of which is revealed during the closing credits) in the physical performances required of actors, trussed up in rubber suits, donning CGI headsets and with motion detectors up the wazoo. But these days, it's still ho-hum: we have ceased to be thrilled or even distracted by excellent digital rendering. Technological achievement is a given.

But it gives not nearly enough to make this experience worthwhile. A bad trip in cinematic 3-D is still a bad trip. You do wonder if they wouldn't have been better just filming the blessed thing and painting in the background. At least, that way, we could see the real (and eminently admirable) Joan Cusack rather than her ugly, animated approximation.

You also wonder whose bright idea the film's basic premise was. It's a stinker: Mars is short of mums - sorry, *moms* - to bring up the Martian young. This shortage they overcome by abducting earthling mothers, sucking their mothering skills out of them (naturally, by pointing a concentrated beam of pure sunlight at their brains and vaporising them) and infusing the extracted essence of motherhood into ""nannybots"" which the Martians use to raise their young. (How, you might ask? More to the point, why? Wouldn't an intensive week's course in parenting skills from the Earthlings be a better, less wasteful thing?)

So to the action. The Martians target suburban mid west America (and not Cambodia, Italy or the Sudan) for their ideal mom. They kidnap Joan Cusack's ugly avatar while her child Milo (even uglier) frets in his bed that he hasn't appreciated his mom enough. Guiltily he hops out of bed, sees flashing lights under the door (you know, a la Close Encounters) and gives chase while the aliens whisk her away, yielding enough Oedipal innuendo to last a lifetime: Well, at least someone appreciates her. Cue adventure.

The Martians, it turns out, are run by an humourless old bat apparently modelled on an elderly Japanese lady, a character lending the film a weak misogynistic current and a stronger xenophobic one. But whatever the underlying politics, the set-up is just stupid: could they really not think of anything better than that? Martians kidnapping moms? Is this what now passes for wit?

Continuity errors and illogicalities abound: on Mars, the Martians walk around in space suits. Apparently they don't need them on Earth.

So Milo, of course, stows away, planning to rescue his stupefied mother (Cusack, too, must have been stupefied to agree to this). On arrival on Mars the semblance of dramatic or narrative artistry is jettisoned and the computer whizzkids are allowed to take over. The pace explodes, we're galloping around assorted tableaux ripped off from other films (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tron/dp/B004K4N64E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tron</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Close-Encounters-Of-The-Third-Kind/dp/B000TYV3DA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Close Encounters Of The Third Kind</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WALL-E/dp/B001DR9TNS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WALL-E</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wars/dp/B001FVKUA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wars</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Toy-Story/dp/B0009MAO46/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Toy Story</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Avatar/dp/B002VPE1AW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Avatar</a>, even&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Labyrinth/dp/B0001FYR3A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Labyrinth</a>), meeting new characters none of whom are explained, contextualised or justified and all of whom act in unaccountable ways.

Most frenetic, over excited and irritating is Gribble (Dan Fogler), an Earthling left over from a previous mission. (Yes: we've been here before. Did they run out of Earth mom serum to inject their robots with?) Gribble isn't at all funny, though that doesn't seem to be how Fogler sees it. His performance, and really the whole film, reminded me of a recent Charlie Sheen interview. For those who haven't seen one, think Dennis Hopper in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Apocalypse-Now/dp/B00005RDR9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Apocalypse Now</a>. In a bad way.

It is possible to surf over this tidal wave of absurdity because, no matter how little anything makes sense on a micro-level, on a macro level so slavish is this film's devotion to formula we know who the good guy is (Milo - even if it's tremendously hard to like him), we know who the bad guy is, and we know who the selfish, flawed helper is who comes through in the end. As the film stampedes towards its ridiculous conclusion there is a breathtakingly cynical swipe at emotion that only Disney would dream of trying to get away with - a straight-red-card, two-footed lunge of a leg breaker that is so grim I can't find the fortitude to even tell you about it.

I walked out of the theatre grumpier than I'd entered it, and as neither of my kids enjoyed the film much either (by consensus the best bit was when Cujo the cat threw up three minutes in - and you can see that on the trailer), I was only returned to good humour when I heard that this film has created a Martian-sized crater at the box office.

Gribble-un-tastic.

4507191,3,B004ZBA9P6,"Mars Needs Moms is about a boy named Milo (Seth Green) who finds himself on Mars, trying to rescue his mother(Joan Cusack) who has been taken by aliens.
There he meets Gribble(Dan Fogler),a human who has been on the planet for years, hiding from the aliens, while playing video games and some how eating and getting fat. Gribble knows his way around and has plenty of technology to help Milo on his mission to get his mom back. An alien named Ki(Elisabeth Hamois) who has learned how to speak English by watching 70's sitcoms,is also on Milo's side.

  The movie is sweet and charming despite some plot holes and the not too special animation. The animation kept most critics from liking this movie. I think the voice acting and charm are enough to keep viewers entertained though. The movie is touching and I found it hard not to get into it emotionally. Mars Needs Moms is occasionally fun as well. The 3-D, though I admit is surprisingly weak and hardly noticeable.",1300752000,8,968,4.649122807017544

4507310,2,B004ZBA9P6,"With the studios still deciding whether to fully embrace the
3D format or not, these past few months have been barren
of any substantially appealing new product.  Thank goodness
for Walt Disney.  Here is a studio that has fully embraced the
3D format, releasing not only all their 3D theatrical fare to
Blu-ray, but also is in the process of upconverting classics
such as The Lion King and Beauty and the Beast.  This is
a studio that puts a considerable amount of care into their
product and to date, I don't think I have been disappointed
with the value of owning a Disney 3D Blu-ray release.

All that being said, I must admit that I am really struggling with
my feelings for Mars Needs Moms, which seems to be one of
the dullest efforts out of the Robert Zemeckis animation camp
to date despite its high-tech animation.

The story centers around young Milo (Seth Green/Seth Dusky),
a selfish 9 year-old boy who feels as if he is being constantly nagged
by his loving, patient mother (Joan Cusack).  Milo is about to
learn a big lesson about hurting his mother with harsh words when
she is suddenly abducted by aliens fom another planet.

You see, the martians have been spying on human moms for
quite some time as it is those fine motherly qualities have become
their focal point.  For once on Mars, we come find to find the
abductors plan to steal the mother's memories in order to program
""nanny bots"" who have become the planet child-rearers while the women
martians run the planet.  Now motherless and abandoned, Milo seeks
the help of the only other human colonist on the planet, a portly, obnoxious
geek named Gribble (Dan Fogler) who quickly hatches a scheme to free
infultrate the martian city and rescue the boy's mother.

Mars Needs Moms comes from ImageMovers, the animation
studio that Robert Zemeckis founded which was responsible
for bringing groundbreaking capture-motion technology to films
such as The Polar Express and A Christmas Carol.  In many
ways the technology has been greatly advanced as the characters
of Milo and Gribble look so incredibly human that sometimes it
becomes easy to forget you are watching animation.  However,
for some odd reason, the Mother looks eerily out of place, more
limp than the other characters, as if the animators were running
low on budget and concentrated all their efforts into the starring roles.

The film's production design has a very hi-tech look to it, thanks to
the the bewildering and electrifying martian city with its complex
and stylish labyrinth layout that look like something out of a Kubrick
film.  Unfortunately, the visuals are the only thing of real interest
here as the film suffers from being a little too long, a little too preachy
and practically void of any of the humor or charm one would expect
from a Disney film.

The 3D effects are mostly ""adequate,"" but I am afraid in times
where studios should really be convincing the public that there is
real worth in charging higher tickets prices for this technology, there
ought to be more of a payoff for the audience.

The biggest problem I found with Mars Needs Moms in 3D is that
the film mostly takes place within the darkness of the planet landscape.
I have talked about this many times in my reviews but it definately needs
to be repeated here.  It's my opinion that dimly lit scenes somewhat
minimize the the overall 3D effect.  Additionally, dark scenes generally
introduce ghosting issues, which fortunately are very minimal here.

When the screen is vibrant with lighting, such as scenes inside the
martian city, there is a much greater sense of separation of foreground
and background, though it never gets to the level of looking like cardboard
cutouts, which is generally my degree of preference.  There is an absence
of any objects being thrown towards the reviewer, though animated props
such as guns and laser needles seem to protrude the screen from time
to time.  There's also a very nice ""shattering"" effect that happens towards
the end of the film that offers interesting 3D effect.

Here's where things really get good....

At the top of this review I talked about the care that Disney puts into
their Blu-ray product.  We all know that their Blu-ray titles come with
a price premium, but at the same time, there is always a level of confidence
that the product will be first-rate.  That tradition continues with Mars
Needs Moms -- for here lies a transfer that packs a first-rate visual
and sonic experience.

Let's begin with a picture that is as amazingly sharp and detailed as one
would expect from a digitally animated transfer.  Colors seem perfectly
in line here with nice black levels.  The film seems to lack a lot of color
in many of the scenes involving the martian landscape which is mostly
dark and drab.  However, later the film moves to scenes that display a
beautiful array of psychedelic colors that looks visually impressive.

The film's 7.1 DTS-MA audio is something to behold even when
downconverted to 5.1 on my system.  This is a real powerhouse
presentation with booming fidelity.  All my speakers were actively
engaged throughout as I was immersed in an abundance of directional
voices and effects.  Despite the amount of surrounding noise activity,
dialogue remained well grounded. The most impressive aspect of this
soundtrack is the booming LFE.  The bass response is through the roof
here, enabling the viewers to feel the movie beneath their feet.

The 4-disc 3D Blu-ray combo pack features alternate and deleted scenes,
an extended opening and a full-motion capture experience with audio
commentary.  Those are exclusive to the Blu-ray copies.  The included
DVD feature supplements adds a Martian 101 language lesson and a featurette
showcasing the on-set antics of Seth Green and Dan Fogler.  There is also
a digital copy of the film included here.

Mars Needs Moms was a financial disaster for the Disney studio.  It
cost $150 million to make and raked in only $6.9 million domestically.
The motion capture technology was not well received by audiences even
in early screenings.

I mention all of this because even as I viewed this film, I felt somewhat
emotionally unattached to its story despite what I felt was amazing
animation.  The 3D was overall just average.  For the approx. $8 price
difference between the 2D and 3D versions I suppose that I would
recommend the upgrade.  However, I would not advise anyone to buy
this title blindly without having seen it first.",1453075200,,6458,4.853102189781022

4507332,4,B004ZBA9P6,"Fun, funky movie based on the children's book of the same name by Berkeley Breathed (of Bloom County fame).  The animation looks a little creepy at times, but this film came out when motion capture was still in its infancy.  I love the premise of the film, but the implied peril to the main character's mother might be a little dark/intense for younger children.

So I watched it with zero expectation.
The result was. It was good.
Especially the graphic was really good. Almost comparable with star wars.
The story -not as others said- was not that bad.
There's some good moments too. Mother's love and some.
I don't want to reveal so deep so why don't you try yourself?
Yes the story is very predictable right after it begins. But they didn't reveal the very moment right away until the right time.

4507370,3,B004ZBA9P6,"...so, I'll just strongly suggest that you very seriously consider skipping this movie, or at least watch it alone before deciding to let your kids watch it.  Maybe the best audience for this is teens?  HEAVY caution for the younger set, and adults may be super bored.  This is a DARK movie.  CREEPY.  But if you let your kids watch Silence of the Lambs, etc., then this will not be a problem except perhaps for the maternal violence*.

Also, might introduce to a child for the first time many new issues:  A boy viscerally hates his mom.  If you're an adult from a dysfunctional family, the movie's eventual happy ending may make this a healing journey, but for those not from that type of family, even adults, much less kids, may find this dynamic shocking and stressful to watch.

EVIL grandmother--yes, there are wolves dressing like grannies in children's lore, but this lady is the real deal.  Full of hatred and willing to kill.  I know killing is part of our culture, but this movie makes little attempt to capture or restrain, just KILL.

Males are used for nothing else but their sperm-- we are told men and boys are completely useless buffoons who would play all day if not permanently imprisoned in a netherworld of brutal work enslavement in giant trash dumps.

*Mothers are kidnapped and killed on screen.  The effect of 'violence to mother' on kids cannot be underestimated--read some of the other reviews!

There are a lot of disturbing bad influences that are easy to miss.  One, for instance, is nipple torture---when an adult guy refuses to talk, the boy reaches out, grabs the man's nipples and twists till he gives up the information.  [I worry a kid may see that and imitate it in school where the cops are waiting to take them to jail--I once volunteered in a juvenile facility where every boy was raped by an older boy--all it takes is one overnight stay to destroy your child's life.]

Yes, in the end, the evil granny is defeated (though even this is disturbingly handled), family life is lauded, the boy comes to save his mom, and he finally loves her, but can your kids afford the emotional price for this moral journey?",1440633600,,2148,4.637566137566138

Yes, the uncanny valley is present in this film but I guess I'm not really bothered by that the way some people are.  It does take a great deal of suspension of disbelief knowing that there would probably be no known way for an advanced Martian society to hide from us earthlings. But I just sat back and enjoyed the ride. I loved the depth of that world and found the characters and their actions believable. For some reason I was very drawn to the character of Ki.  I hope that doesn't make me some sort of ""Furry.""  I have no idea why this movie was such a disaster at the box office.

Mars needs the order and discipline of Earth mothers' to train their ""Nanny bots"" to discipline the females and keep order. Once the mother is drained of her discipline,she is literally vaporized by the sun..VAPORIZED!! In this movie there is a:
-child who sees his mother get vaporized
-a firing squad
-characters that look eerily realistic
-an annoying guy(the man who saw his mother's vaporization as a child)

""If you're a good child,aliens will kidnap your mother and kill her because you do your chores and eat broccolli"".What kind of message is that to a soceity that already has horrible children?!

Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0

According to Wikipedia, 'Mars needs Moms', was the 5th biggest box office bomb in motion picture history. It cost about $150 million and the lifetime, world-wide gross was a little over $21 million. So where exactly did it go wrong? It's one of those films made using motion capture technology. The critics were split on the use of that technology: some dug it quite a bit and others found the characters to be like Madame Tussaud wax figures. Personally, I wasn't bothered by actors who had their movements and facial features, filled in by the magic of computer animation. And if you wait for the end credits, you'll see outtakes of just how the cast looked, when acting as 'motion capture' subjects.

'Mars' is based on a sci-fi, black comedy picture book of the same name by Berkeley Breathed. The adaptation is geared much more for adults than kids as it has quite a bit of a dark sub-text, that perhaps is a bit too off-putting for many viewers. For starters, nine-year-old protagonist Milo's declaration during the film's opening scene, that he wished he never had a mother, is a bit jarring; this especially after his mother merely asks him to take out the garbage and punishes him for not eating his broccoli. The kid immediately regrets his harsh rejoinder and spends the entire time trying to make up for the faux pas. The heartbroken look on the mother's face stays with you despite the fact that such a harsh statement emanates from a kid's mouth.

If there is a positive side to the film, it's in the action adventure component. Milo's adventures, as he manages to stow away on the ship that's his kidnapped Mom now finds herself on, and how he escapes initial capture on the Red Planet, are exciting moments indeed. The idea of Gribble, the man-child, who jokes how he's a secret astronaut from an 80s Reagan era program but is actually like Milo (a kid who tried to save his Mom), doesn't quite hit the mark, not only because he's a buffoon but the fact that he's been stranded on Mars since his childhood after his Mom was also kidnapped. What's worse is that he actually witnessed the Martians performing their own version of a lobotomy on his Mom and failed to save her, which I would think is a disturbing idea for young viewers to take.

There's more noir to endure when we discover that the Martian world is a vast police state run by females only (the childlike, ineffectual males are beneath the surface, existing in a giant trash compactor). The females are headed by 'The Supervisor', the film's antagonist, a Lady MacBeth-like, crazed control freak, who resembles a shriveled up, Spielberg Extraterrestrial. The mad Supervisor is a fun character and is pitted against Ki, who adopts the language of Hippies from an early 70s TV sitcom, which she finds in some secret files, she's assigned to oversee. Ki is the Mar's version of a beatnik, who enjoys painting colorful graffiti on the drab Martian home world. My problem with the Ki character is why is she the only one to break away from the pack? There seems no explanation for it, in the context of the story.

Milo only has a few hours to save his mother, and you probably can guess the film's denouement if you haven't seen the film yet. It's all rather predictable and the film's scenarists lost a big opportunity when they failed to develop Milo's mother as a fully developed character. Instead of having her disappear for most of the narrative, strapped to a gurney, wouldn't it have been better if the Martians made her a sentient overseer--directing the nannybots (who also could have interactional capabilities) in proper parenting techniques (a more animated Picard Locutus, is the character I'm thinking of).

For sheer action, Mars needs Moms, has some clever action scenes. But essentially it's a rescue story, and most of the characters prove to be decidedly one-note. It's worth watching, but deserves only an average rating.",1380412800,4,3984,4.7485549132947975

The movie itself is ok, it has a good quality picture and cgi effects, but the argument and the story is very poor.  For example, if you compare this movie with wall-e there is a huge gap between them. The martians are ok, but it seems so silly... and I believe it has a lot of sexual discrimination as well. Martian males are not important in this movie, and represent them like lazy and stupid people. Martian females have not feelings, because they do not want their babies, that's why they need to abduce women from the earth.  The movie tell us something, if you leave a male child without parents, and when he grows old, he is going to became an older kid, so he is not going to mature.  On the other hand, martians look like they do not want their lives. Finally, the only good message that you can get is: ""you have to love your mother, and respect forever"", I do agree with that, because mothers are our reason to live and be good people. I can see that they strugle with their kids, and that's why this movie is a good recomendation to watch with your family on mother's day.",1360281600,,1173,4.3136363636363635

4507560,4,B004ZBA9P6,"I do think that this one is probably for kids over 7 years of age. It strikes deep at the fears of kids , mom being taken away, dying etc. It's not a typical kids movie at all. the cgi and 3d effects are frist rate and this cost 200 million to make. It is quite awesome in that regard. Just fantastic, the story is about the martians needing a mom, not moms though. And that title was perhaps the biggest reason people didn't go see this. ""adventure on mares' would have done much better or anything other than the title they chose. There is a deleted scene in hear.

This however has faucets of it that are intense, like facing a firing squad among other dangers. However the message here is a good one that family matters more than anything else. It's not a great movie but it's not terrible and it's cgi effects are among the best out there for this type of movie. this needs to be seen in 3d to get it's full effect though. the blu ray has a dvd in it.

4507587,5,B004ZBA9P6,"Most Disney films tend to have a positive message that matches with the overall mission of the Disney Empire itself, you know, this thing about the happiest place on earth. That's said, the colorful and fascinating ""Mars Needs Moms"" follows that path, this time the message being the love to our mothers.
The film is based on a book by cartoonist Berkeley Breathed, who you may recognize for his comic strip Bloom County. We immediately meet Milo, a young boy who has a disagreement with his mother because he doesn't want to eat his vegetables. He tries to outsmart her and gets caught. He is reprimanded by his mother and sent to his room. Angry at her, he says, ""My life would be so much better if I didn't have a mom at all."" These words came at a bad moment, because it is precisely at that time that some Martians kidnap his mother to take her to their planet. Fortunately, Milo realizes what is happening, and, unbeknown to the Martians, gets inside the spacecraft just in time.

Once in Mars, Milo tries to take his mother back to earth. For his good luck, he meets Gribble - who steals the movie --, who agrees to help him. It turns out that the Martians kidnapped Milo's mom because she has ""order and discipline."" Because of these qualities, they want to extract her memory, and are planning to take it out and put it in a nanny box (actually, the story is a little more complex). Furthermore, the surface of the planet is inhabited only by females, ruled by a little lady dictator named ""The Supervisor."" All the boys are sent underground to fend for themselves. So it is up to Milo and his friends to save his mother before she becomes victim of the Supervisor's plan.

As I mentioned before, ""Mars Needs Moms"" is very colorful and it is truly a visual treat. It also has intense at moments, with a truly rewarding ending. It took a lot of effort and imagination to put this movie together, based on the simple premise that we should love our mothers. The Blu-ray and DVD edition of this film includes and extended opening, deleted scenes, a feature about life in Mars, and much more. Released August 9, 2011. (USA, 2011, color, 88 mins plus additional materials). Exclusively reviewed on August 18, 2011 by Eric Gonzalez. Disney Blu-ray",1318377600,2,2250,4.566831683168317

Describing it is not easy but if you will forgive the pun, MARS NEEDS MOMS is a down-to-earth story of family and relationships. It is mostly a story of a boy who after fighting with his mother suddenly finds she has been taken aboard a spaceship. His desperate chase and efforts to get his mother back is made the more interesting when he finds himself on Mars!

The story is easy to follow, even the addition of a couple twists. I won't give it away, but I do recommend this movie for the entire family.",1314921600,4,766,4.387323943661972
4507598,4,B004ZBA9P6,"If you are at all concerned with the computer animated film industry, you probably know a little bit about Robert Zemeckis' unique approach of motion capture to achieve an animated product that looks remarkably lifelike (a technique he has proven in films like The Polar Express, Beowulf, A Christmas Carol and Monster House thus far).  The unique stylized look is back in Mars Needs Moms and this one managed to secure the promotion and backing by none other than Disney - who of course has been making a big push in the computer generated feature arena themselves since the absorption of Pixar.

The plot of this one is certainly unique with a welcome science fiction flare not as thoroughly fleshed out since Pixar's own Wall-E.  The story follows nine-year-old Milo (played by Seth Green for the motion capture but voiced by child actor Seth Dusky) who, like most kids his age, is more interested in watching zombie movies than doing chores or eating his broccoli at dinner. When Milo's misconduct prompts his mother (Joan Cusack) to punish him with an early bedtime and no zombie pay-per-view, a moment straight out of Home Alone ensues: ""I wish I didn't have a mother!"" and hence the lesson of being careful what you wish for commences.

When Milo wakes to discover his mother is being kidnapped by Martians, fear of being probed is put on the backburner as he stages a rescue attempt that results in his being accidentally dragged along on for a ride to the red planet itself. Once there, Milo is befriended by a fellow earthling refuge calling himself Gribble (Dan Fogler), an overly enthusiastic man-child who's decades-long absence from Earth has left him trapped in the cultural mindset of the 1980s.

Surprisingly enough, this picture comes from a long line of CG-feature films inspired by children's books (a list that includes How to Train Your Dragon, Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs, Meet the Robinsons to mention a few).  The screenplay is surprisingly competent and while the intended audience of the film will likely be too swept up in the grandeur of the visuals to be concerned with such things, diehard scifi fans will likely be a bit frustrated by several questions of Marian society that are never fully answered.

However, the film juggles some pretty heavy themes- the dangers of suppressing free will in society, reliance upon technology, the universal power of love and why moms are more than simply nagging buzz-kills for example- it does so with that trademarked Zemeckis brand of humor that has made past efforts like Back to the Future so endearing.  There are references scattered about that younger kids probably won't appreciate, but adults who remember a thing or two about the 80s will surely get a rise from.  The humor in Monster House was certainly more universally appealing but it is nice that not all kid-oriented films rely upon slapstick for laughs.

The visuals here are an interesting mix of elements.  On the one hand, the motion capture technique is capable of delivering facial expressions that are truly without rival (after all, this is essentially the tool James Cameron used to develop the aliens in Avatar).  On the flip side it does away with the exaggerated characterizations kids flock to in your average DreamWorks or Pixar piece.  In fact, at a glance, the human characters here can almost pass as live-action with just a hint of aberrance in their faces.

In all, this is a solid family film that doesn't tread upon objective language or themes that is rife with interesting environments, and a nice brisk pace that seems even quicker than its one-hour 22-minte runtime.",1314921600,4,3633,4.8957654723127035

We all loved the movie and want to see it again and again. Very well thought-out and produced. We are surprised it didn't do better in the theaters. By the way, seeing it on a big screen would be optimal as the imagery is awesome. Regardless, a great flick for the entire family :)",1314576000,3,581,4.4392523364485985
4507600,3,B004ZBA9P6,"This was a passable but unexceptional story, full of decentish characters and alright scenarios, but not many funnies...there is the rather mischievous young main character, his poor mother, who must constantly keep him out of trouble, a chubby, nerdy kid-grown-to-adulthood human resident of Mars, an evil Hitler-esque head of Mars, and the peppy, hippie-ish, ""flower power"" Martian girl...

These characters aren't fodder for greatness, and in that 'Mars Needs Moms' comes through: they are not great, nor are they terribly funny. By the same token, they're not awful; they're just ok.

The story mirrors its characters ... it's not fantastic, but it's not awful either. (spoilers) Martians kidnap the main character's mother -- after he's said something nasty to her -- and plan to kill her. With the help of ""Grimble"", the chubby nerd whose own mother met the same fate, and the flower power alien, he must rescue her. (end spoilers)

Everything is decent and watchable, but nothing is awesome or memorable. There is not much character development, and the happily ever after ending on Mars is too silly (I'm thinking specifically of what happens with the main alien). The graphics are nice...everything is ""pretty"" and visually appealing. Perhaps the worst part of the film is that it is intended to be funny at points...and just isn't really.

This is a film to watch once, and, if you like it, re-watch...and otherwise, forget and move on. 2.5/5 stars...not funny enough for comedy, not good enough for anything else",1314403200,,1523,5.104417670682731
4507601,3,B004ZBA9P6,"What makes Mars Needs Moms an unfortunate misfire isn't so much what it is, but what it could have been. The talent was there, with a fine cast, a seasoned group of artists behind the scenes and an interesting idea. I just wonder what might have happened had this been a CG or a live action movie.

Motion capture, or as it is now insistently known, ""performance capture,"" records the actions of the actors and transfers them into what is more akin to the ""rotoscoping"" process in Gulliver's Travels (1939). It seems best used for non-human creatures, like Gollum in The Lord of the Rings trilogy, or to affect a total dreamlike feeling, as in The Polar Express. Somehow it is emerging more as a tool than a medium.

When I saw Jim Carrey in A Christmas Carol, I really wanted to see his own face, since he was doing such an outstanding job. I felt the same way about Joan Cusack in Mars. Why cover such artistry with a plastic sheet? Kind of like my Aunt Sadie's couch. (Sorry, that was a little harsh.)

The aliens are less disturbing and odd than the humans in Mars Needs Moms. Maybe this process will keep getting better each time, but who knows. What is a fact is that Disney is now taking the words ""of Mars"" off John Carter of Mars to avoid any comparison. They needn't have worried--it's not the word ""Mars"" that kept people away, though many of us might have thought of the B-grade sci-fi comedy ""Mars Needs Women"" when hearing the title ""Mars Needs Moms.""

The Blu-ray looks marvelous--this is a very elaborate production, so I would not say to avoid it, actually-- and there are a few extras, including footage of the actors before the process was added, which only serves to show how much we should have seen their real faces rather than overlays.",1314057600,,1759,4.504702194357367

The way I look at it the martins was well done and executed-ed but the humans was a total failure.
The only good human was Gribble and even the 3D animator managed to foul that up.

This movie would of been at least 59% better if it was live action mixed with 3D animated martins.

But it's not all white wash failure of a movie the gadgets was an awesome concept and the story is extremely daring and best to be avoided by any overly impressionable children who's beliefs can be influenced by movies.
And the alien Ki who has the best physical acting in the whole movie is welcome change with her 60s reference lines, And use of flower tags.

The movie still manages to hand it's views the all two traditional sappy happily ever after ending.

I just hope if they do another mars needs moms sequel or at least a remake they will use a different 3D animation studio to do the humans or at least make it live action mixed with 3D animation.

My end review is this.
Motion capture suits with all the human roles acting drowned out into robots. Big minus.
Milo's mom look's more like a male then a female. Another big minus.
Milo's mom get's next to no screen time. Huge plus.
Cleaver gadgets That is both fun and interesting to watch.
The martins are both fun and well animated with very expressive dialogue.
The alien Ki is a very fun twist on a 60's style flower power girl.
Gribble has brilliant dialogue to bad he is ruined by poor 3D animators.
The story is very daring and best avoided by any one who thinks movies are real or believes every movie has a message.

All in all this movie will not be a hit and will no doubt be a miss.
Watch it? I'd say once
Replay value? Two times may be three?
Worth it for the aliens? Yes if you can stand the crappy job on the humans.
Should the studio take another stab at this movie? Yes, Re-shoot the human scenes with live action, and hire a kid for the role of Milo. Then it would be perfect.
You give it how much? 2 1/2 stars no more no less.
Does this movie suck? Sort of.",1313452800,,2123,4.176039119804401

4507608,5,B004ZBA9P6,"It's really a shame that critics gave this movie negative reviews. I agree with the majority here that Mars Needs Moms is a worthwhile family film, that-in my opinion-every family should share together. Heck, I even recommend it be purchased as it's definitely worth every penny. It's a brilliantly humorous touching tale.

The story is about a young boy named Milo who finds out just how much he needs his mom when she is kidnapped by a group of aliens from Mars. Attempting to save her when she is abducted, Milo ends up coming along for the ride. Reaching Mars and being nabbed by the aliens, he gets some help from an unlikely friend named Gribble. Gribble and Milo make friends and set out on a crazy mission to save Milo's mom.

While I feel the critics got it all wrong with this movie, I do feel that some movies just aren't meant to be released in theaters no matter how good they are. Let's face it, if it isn't a high profile CGI movie(like Toy Story, Shrek or Ice Age)--most movies of this type are doomed to fail. At least, with releasing it on DVD, it can be a moderate success if not a great success. I expect Mars Needs Moms to be of the latter, given time.

Don't listen to the critics, though. Listen to the ones that really matter...the people. We all know a good thing when we see it and Mars Needs Moms is an astounding film.",1313452800,,1346,4.354581673306773
4507609,4,B004ZBA9P6,"""Mars Needs Moms"" will never be mistaken for ""Apocalpyse Now"" much less ""Toy Story"" but it IS an entertaining diversion. It seems Simon Wells (the great grandson of H.G. Wells) can't escape his past or the subjects of his grandfather's writing; ""Mars"" makes the second time that Wells has worked on a project that is somehow tied into his great-grandfather's work (he also directed the recent live action version of ""The Time Machine"").

It seems that good moms are being kidnapped by Martians and young hero Milo (Seth Dusky--motion capture performance by Seth Green)gets whisked away with his mom (Joan Cusack)to the Red Planet and he must figure out a way to get both of them back to Earth. With the assistance of Reagan era secret astronaut Gribble (Dan Fogler) Milo must stop the Martians from doing something evil and wrong to his mom.

""Mars Needs Moms"" looks positively stunning in HD. Colors pop and there's a level of detail that the BD disc provides nice resolution for. Audio is presented in 7.1 DTS-HD and sounds terrific as well. It's too bad that the film didn't get a bigger audience but that had more to do with marketing and less with the quality of the film itself.

The special features are quite nice as well. We get a commentary track featuring director Wells, Green and Fogler (clearly recorded before the film premiered because they seem quite optimistic about the future of the film as a Disney franchise).

""Life on Mars"" focuses on the motion capture shooting that provided the basis for the animation.

""Martian 101"" allows us to find out about the creation of the Martian language and culture for the film.

""Fun with Seth"" takes us behind-the-scenes on the set letting us see the cast goof off a bit.

We also get deleted scenes and an alternate beginning in various states of completion with an introduction by director Simon Wells.

It's a pity that ""Mars Needs Moms"" met with public indifference--if it had been marketed better it might have found it's audience as it's an entertaining film although not quite in the class of the work that Pixar does (although it does have a much darker story element than we would normally see in a Pixar flick).",1313366400,3,2180,4.748677248677248

I say if you're going to make a cartoon then make one, that actually looks like a cartoon, there's nothing wrong with that. If you want it to look real then why not just do a live action movie? I Remember watching The Polar Express and thinking that they all looked eerily freaky and I could not get past that. Here it's more the same thing.
But if you don't mind that then here is a synopsis: Milo's mom is kidnapped by aliens in order to suck out her mom-essence so it can be programmed into Mom-bots to raise alien babies. Why don't they just raise them themselves? I really have no idea. Why don't they use the male aliens to raise them? I really have no idea. Why can't they just program the Mom-bots to be better moms? I really have no idea. Why do the Mars aliens need oxygen masks on their own planet? I really have no idea. Why don't.....Well you get the picture. It's not a horrible movie it's just not that good.

They have a tendency to do that.  Alas, I was bored and couldn't decide on what to stream.  I chose this out of about three others, if for anything, the animation value.

I might not have purchased this if it hadn't been for Target's special this week. If you buy this and the fox and the hound you save an additional $8 (take the DMR coupons and save a total of $18)

4507616,4,B004ZBA9P6,"Simon Wells is known for his storyboard art work for ""Shrek 2"", ""Antz"", ""Madagascar"", as well as directing animated films such as ""An Americna Tail: Fievel Goes West"" and ""The Time Machine"".

This time around, Wells joins filmmaker/producer Robert Zemeckis (""Back to the Future"" films, ""The Polar Express"", ""The Monster House"", ""Beowulf"") for the animated film ""Mars Needs Moms"".  A film based on the book of the same title by Berkeley Breathed.

VIDEO:

""Mars Needs Moms"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  The film looks absolutely great in HD.  With the animation process that Robert Zemeckis used for ""Polar Express"", he tries to bring that realism to ""Mars Needs Moms"". There is great detail on the facial expressions, especially how the talent were motion-captured.  There is a sense of realism with the characters and I absolute love the CG detail for not only the characters but their surroundings.  And the detail really does show on Blu-ray.

Because the film takes place on Mars, there is a good number of scenes that showcase fire, many reds, oranges and browns and for the most part, these vibrant colors really pop.  There is a lot of detail when it comes to the metallic parts, the gears, the weapons, the spacecraft,  computer displays, etc.

But I know that for many people, the main contention of the CG animation is the overall look of the characters.  For one, ""Mars Needs Moms"" follows up the style that Zemeckis did with ""The Polar Express"" and that is CG animation with realism.  Disney is know for its Pixar films and there is a difference when it comes to their style of films.

Personally, I enjoyed the look of Zemeckis' ""The Polar Express"" and even ""The Monster House"", especially how the technology was used on ""Beowulf"".  But for a children's film, the look might be too creepy.

I showed it to my son and to me, he wasn't bothered by it.  He actually enjoyed the film , so I know critics have tried to come up with reasons of why the film didn't perform well in the box office and some point towards the animation but I personally don't think the animation was the problem.

If anything, the CG looks great on Blu-ray and those who didn't watch the film in theaters, will definitely enjoy it in HD!

As for teh DVD, the DVD is presented in widescreen (2:40:1 aspect ratio) - enhanced for 169 televisions.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Mars Needs Moms"" is presented in English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (48 kHz/24-bit) and English DVS 2.0 Dolby Digital, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.

The lossless soundtrack for ""Mars Needs Moms"" is fantastic!  From the blasts of the spacecraft, the sounds of Milo falling in the trash heap, the laser blasts to the sounds of the oxygen mask shattering, there is a good amount of surround sound usage in this film but also how there is slight echoes to the dialogue of characters depending on the rooms that they are at.

So, while there is crystal clear dialogue and music coming from the front and center channels, the surround and rear surround channels are used very well throughout the film.  I was absolutely pleased by the lossless soundtrack.

As for the DVD version, the DVD is presented in English, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital and English DVS 2.0 Dolby Digital.

Subtitles are in English SDH, Spanish and French.

JUDGMENT CALL:

A fantastic family film with a good amount of action and adventure. ""Mars Needs Moms: 2-Disc Combo Pack Edition"" is absolutely wonderful on Blu-ray!

""Mars Needs Moms"" despite its title that may make children think this is a film for daughters, the film is definitely for children who love action and adventure, and also add sci-fi to the mix!  The film was much more than I expected and watching it together with 8-year-old, we both enjoyed the film from beginning to end.

Of course, I am aware of how the film did terribly in the box office.  As many critics have pointed the finger towards Zemeckis' and his use of the CG technology of realism not being for the children.  The fact is that many children's films tend to have featured on animals and or objects, Zemeckis' films use actual beings and tries to interject realism to those characters.

We have seen the efficacy of films such as ""The Polar Express"" and ""Monster House"" and while not following the typical Disney formula of human characters that lack realism or not using animals or objects as its main characters, ""Mars Needs Moms"" in my opinion is not the animation that was at fault. Granted, some people may find the realism creepy, I didn't, my son didn't and I just don't think that the animation was at fault.

I personally feel that the title had something to do with it.  Call it something else without ""Moms"" in the title or focus on the adventures that are taking place in Mars and it gives young kids a different idea of what the film is about.  Heck, call it ""Space Adventures in Mars"" and that would probably get children all excited.

""Mars Needs Moms"" will definitely be an eye-opener for parents as we see the mom and child arguments (more like, children not wanting to listen and are being a bit more rebellious at the age of 8-years and older) and just that opening sequence alone shows you the mindset of children and children probably will not want a title with ""moms"", they may love their moms but as these kids grow older, the less they will publicly acknowledge it and probably will not want to be seen in a public theater watching a film about rescuing mom.

The title also gives a feeling that the film is maybe for young little girls when in fact the film can be enjoyed by any child and families but not limited to a certain demographic.  So, it makes me wonder if the title was even tested with children to see what their reactions are.  Sure, we know that children love their moms but children at that age are also trying to be defiant and rebellious towards their moms as well.

Regardless of what transpired in the box office, I do feel that this film can have new life on video.  The story is fun, the Blu-ray of ""Mars Needs Moms"" is absolutely gorgeous. There is a lot of detail, vibrant colors and for Disney Blu-ray fans, they know what to expect and that is quality when it comes to picture quality.  And for audio, once again...fantastic!  7.0 DTS-HD MA lossless soundtrack and you get an immersive soundscape.  Wonderful audio quality and once again, fans with a home theater system will definitely enjoy this Blu-ray release!

I do feel that Disney went a little lax on the special features.  Aside from deleted scenes, the other two features are only two minutes long.  An audio commentary would have been nice or even a gag reel.

With the Blu-ray release, you have two choices.  One is a 2-Disc Combo Pack with the Blu-ray and DVD and then there is the 4-disc combo pack which those with a 3D-enabled television and Blu-ray player can enjoy the film in 3D and also get the regular Blu-ray, DVD and also digital copy of the film.  It's important to note that the 4-disc version also has a special exclusive feature in 3D.

Overall, ""Mars Needs Moms"" was a lot better than I expected.  In fact, as a parent of a child who is also starting to back-talk with his mother, not eat his broccoli and also complaining about chores, I watched my son's reaction to the film, especially during its most emotional moment.  But realizing that while the film has plenty of action and adventure to keep children interested in the film, there is also a message for the children to also respect their mother.

It's a situation I'm sure many mothers and their young children go through but I was glad to see how that message of mother/child bond was integrated into the film.

While ""Mars Needs Mom"" may not have the typical Disney look for its CG animation, I still feel it was an enjoyable sci-fi, adventure family film.  I'm not saying its perfect, nor is it great but it is enjoyable, fun and a family film that parents and children can enjoy together.

Sometimes, I think you really need to send in a kid to do a kids' job - particularly in reviewing a movie made for kids. Adults just don't get it. Here are video reviews by 2 of our 8 -year-old youth film critics reviews and, believe me, they loved it!

The DVD comes out this week so don't pass it by, give it the good old family try.
""This movie is out of this world literally, because it takes place on Mars, A.K.A The Red Planet. The movie is about a little boy named Milo voiced by Seth Dusky, who says some pretty mean things to his mom. Before he has a chance to apologize, she is Martian-napped and taken to Mars. He has 6.93 earth hours until sun rise to save her. Does he make it in time!

My favorite part is when Gribble, voiced by Dan Fogler, saves Milo's mom with the helmet that was meant for his mom. I thought that was very thoughtful. My favorite characters are Gribble, because he's just simply Gribbletastic. Ki, because she helps Milo, and she does something that no other Martain has ever done. She stands up to the supervisor. Head of all Martians, Milo, because he realizes that he needs his mom and is determined to do whatever he needs to save her.

I rate this movie 4 out of 5 stars because the Martains are a little scary, especially the supervisor. So for this reason I recommend this movie to kids ages 7 and up."" Reviewed by Ny'Asia Bell, age 8, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic
""I just finished watching an excellent movie called ""Mars Needs Moms."" The movie is about a boy named Milo who goes on a big adventure to help save his mom from aliens. The aliens that live on Mars are not very good mothers so they look to Earth to find good mothers to steal.

My favorite characters are Milo, Milo's mom, and Gribble.  I liked Gribble because he helped Milo get his mother back and he helps Milo to see how important his mother truly is. My favorite part of the movie is when Milo has to save his new friend Gribble from the aliens. Gribble gets captured and the aliens are going to shoot him. Milo swings in to save the day and it is awesome.

This movie does have some characters that are bad and try to stop Milo from saving his mom. The aliens in the uniforms are bad because they listen to the Supervisor. The Supervisor controls everyone and wants everyone to do what she says.

I would recommend this movie for ages three and up. I think depending on what age you are is how you will see this movie. For example, my brother is 5 and he didn't think the movie was scary at all. I am 8 and I found the movie to be a little scary because it made me think about how sad I would be if I lost my own mother. But don't worry everything turns out ok in the end! Go out and buy this movie when it comes out on Disney DVD and Blu Ray.
