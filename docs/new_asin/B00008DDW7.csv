7982090,1,B00008DDW7,"With a title like extreme fishing you would think it would be an interesting and exciting DVD.Instead it is more of a how to for complete novice anglers. It starts with a long winded(and Boring)how to of shark fishing. Then moves on to tuna,you see a few tuna being caught, unfortunately the footage is from someones charter trip,the anglers are inexperienced and the crew not far behind(watch them try to gaff the Dolphin(mahi Mahi),the audio is also awfull.
It finishes with marlin fishing,
bit better,actually shows some nice footage but again terribe audio.
All in all the cheesey naration and poor audio ruin it. My advice, if you are already a fisherman save your money and buy yourself a new lure. Maybe a 'Moldcraft' which the DVD plugs throughout.",1076371200,4,756,4.868217054263566
