8585025,5,B00CQESHT4,"I purchased this instructional DVD for my mom to use since she just got a new PC with Windows 8.  She has generally been the type to shy away from new technology, and me trying to teach her was proving not effective.  I randomly saw this DVD on amazon and figured I would give it a try.  All I can say is that Professor Jay was an excellent teacher and my mom was able to easily follow the instructions in order to become well acquained with Windows 8 and several other features of computer and internet use.  Even my grandmother who is almost 90 years old watched the DVD and was able to get some valuable tips on how to use computers.  I'm so glad that I found this DVD because it saves me the trouble of having to try and fumble my way through explaining the basics of computer use.  Not only was this DVD very helpful, Professor Jay has a great personablity and spark that made the entire experience very enjoyable.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone who is trying to learn the basics and beyond of PC and general computer use.  Please make more DVDs!!",1374883200,,1059,4.28643216080402
