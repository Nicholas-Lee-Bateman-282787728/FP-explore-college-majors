8104944,5,B000E372UY,"As one of the people who created Remote Viewing, as well as one of the producers of this netowrk prime time special, I want to respond to Webshaman's review.  All of the cases reported in this program involve Remote Viewing.  It is not explicitly discussed because the program is, as it was described, a presentation of how the ability to open to nonlocal awareness affected these cases.  It is the case not the specifics of the process that are emphasized.  This is a television program not a video course.  For that take a look at The Gold Standard Course, which covers the history of Remote Viewing, as well as the ""how to"" aspects.  As to the accuracy of the accounts in Psychic Detectives, to the approval of ABC's Standards and Practices Department every word in the script, and every image on the screen, had to be supported by two sources, drawn only from a limited list:  Forensic evidence, sworn testimony, on the record statements by court officers, and law enforcement officers.  No media coverage was permitted as a source.  I am quite comfortable in saying that these accounts accurately represent what actually happened.

If Webshaman would care to return his disk, we will be happy to refund his money.

I make that statement as an explanation, the only one that I can think of as to why he would LIE SO BLATANTLY about the contents of the DVD. In the description of the DVD, it claims to have 5 cases that were solved by the assistance of 5 remote viewers. There were in fact 5 cases studies and they were perhaps solved by the psychics who worked on those cases. BUT NOT A SINGLE ONE OF THOSE PSYCHICS WAS A REMOTE VIEWER! THERE WASN'T EVEN A DISCUSSION OF REMOTE VIEWING ON THE DVD! I specifically purchased the DVD because of my interest in remote viewing. I even debated as to whether I should pay the hefty price of $24.95 NOT INCLUDING SHIPPING COSTS, to satisfy my interest. It is an understament to say that I am disappointment. To say that I am shocked is far more accurate. Shocked that anyone would be so deceitful, knowing that he is selling to a clientele that trusts the integrity of the Amazon.com market place. It is an equal black eye to Amazon.com that this shameless act of theft occured on its web site. I HAVE BEEN ROBBED!

BUYERS BEWARE! Unless you interested in the ""traditional"" forms of psychic involvement in the solving of case studies, then DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING THIS DVD! Shame on you Nemoseen Video for your act of professional and merchant misconduct. SHAME, SHAME, SHAME!!!!!!!",1128038400,7,1416,4.53125
