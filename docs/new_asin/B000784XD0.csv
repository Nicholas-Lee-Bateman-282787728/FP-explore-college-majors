2204278,3,B000784XD0,"""The Fighting Marines"" has a 1936 copywrite on the screen credits.  The improbable misadventures of a pair of Marine NCO's as they face the ""masked villian"" in 12 cliff-hanging chapters, this serial shows its western movie heritage!  I mention the date because the movie has science fiction elements.  The serial was the grand daddy of today's television series.  ""The Fighting Marines"" makes a valiant effort to maintain continuity.  There is a lot to like about this serial even though it is a low-budget production.  The special effects are great for the era.  The plot line is hokey--a mysterious ""masked villian"" is doing things to stop the establishment of an airfield on Halfway Island.  The villian's motivation could have been developed better.

I'd like to know more about where ""The Fighting Marines"" was filmed.  The location shots appear to be Southern California, and there are some nice aircraft footage.

Bonus features on the DVD include a trailer, a Flip the Frog cartoon and a newsreel.  The newsreel shows USSR bomber and paratroop operations, a rocket pack test on ice skates, a footbal game, and ""Looking Back on 1937"" (with labor activism, the Spanish Civil War in Madrid, King George VI's coronation, flooding in the Ohio Balley, Texas gas explosion, Amelia's last flight, the Hindenburg) The newsreel had an instrumental sound track--only music.

The vintage newsreel is a piece of history.  The serial was okay--I imagine it was quite a bit better back in the 1930's.",1278633600,7,1493,5.065573770491803

8045664,5,B000784XD0,"I love the old movie serials.  One noticeable thing about them is all the fist fights despite the presence of plenty of guns.  Also, the marines use pistols to fight off the natives who don't seem to be very good fighters.  Many people in these old time movies really look overweight.  There's a lot of running and pursuing going on so I think they'd really be out of breath, but they're not.  Anyway, this is a good story.  Our two marines are both buddies and heroes.  They never hesitate to jump in and fight for their ideals.  Too bad we weren't all this brave.",1456617600,2,565,4.365384615384615

8045666,4,B000784XD0,"The Fighting Marines is a twelve chapter serial from Mascot Pictures. Mascot Pictures was primarily a B movie, western and serial producer. Mascot, along with several other small studios folded into republic pictures. The Fighting Marines serial was made in 1935 which makes it eighty years old. Today, as it was eighty years ago, this serial is very enjoyable to watch. I can just imagine my father as an eleven year old boy, sitting in a darkened theater every Saturday watching this and other fine serials of the day.
