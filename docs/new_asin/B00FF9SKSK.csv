All roads have truly led to this latest installment of the Fast and The Furious series, Fast 6. Although it is somewhat lengthy, I didn't mind because the movie kept me entertained throughout the entire thing. Its a must watch for any car fan. The stunts are simply amazing, the cars are sexy as ever, and plus Michelle Rodriquez is back! Fast 7 comes out next summer, so be sure to catch this one in theaters because it brings viewera up to speed with every movie, even Tokyo Drift.",1369440000,13,498,4.483516483516484
5986682,3,B00FF9SKSK,"Fast & Furious 6 is not the best of the series. The acting and writing is still top notch but after six films there's not a lot of surprises left. We've seen Vin Diesel and that other guy go through a lot together and we've seen them grow from plucky young speedsters to delightful young men who still enjoy driving a little bit faster than others, but I think time to bring the series to a close.",1369440000,5,397,4.1688311688311686
5986683,5,B00FF9SKSK,"During the opening credits there are flashbacks to previous films to jog your memory. These are not intended to bring anyone up to speed. There is some minor character build up in spite of the fact we already know who they are.

In this film Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) becomes involved with a group of bad guys lead by Shaw (Luke Evans). They are described as the best in ""vehicular warfare"" something that appears to be almost unique to this film series. In order to catch them, our ""swagger-less"" cop Hobbs(Dwayne Johnson) must employ the use of wanted fugitive Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his team in order to save Europe or something else immaterial. They are up against a group of criminal described as their ""evil twins"" because apparently we couldn't figure that out for ourselves.

The film uses all the fun things we have grown use to in the series: impossible car chases/races, fist fighting, eye candy, tough guy talk, and of course the humorous banter and a disdain for physics in a fantastic climax scene.

In addition to all the features that appeal to muscle heads, the film also works upon the theme of the modern extended family. Because of societies' mobility and separation, many people have incorporated friends as part of their ""family."" This film stretches the honor among thieves into the brotherhood of man, but doesn't make it too sappy. A great addition to the series, one that opens up to sequel possibilities. If you own 5 of them. Make it a 6 pack.

My only criticism is that I would have liked to have seen a script with a larger role for Jordana Brewster.

Parental Guide: 1-2 f-bombs. Implied sex. No nudity (side breast, skimpy bikinis)",1369440000,,1674,4.738831615120275
5986684,5,B00FF9SKSK,"Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, and Michelle Rodriguez team up again for some more adrenaline pumping action. This movie takes place after Fast Five. After dealing with being chassed by federal agent Luke Hobbs in the previous movie, Hobbs now finds himself asking Dom and his crew to go to London to help him take down a team of mercenary drivers. Once Dom finds out Letty is still alive he convinces his crew to help Hobbs and help him find Letty on the condition they get full pardons. Once again some of the previous stars through the past Fast and Furious films return, including Tyrese Gibson, (Roman Pearce - 2 Fast 2 Furious) Ludacris (Tej - 2 Fast 2 Furious), Gal Gadot, (Gisele - Fast and Furious) Sung Kang (Han - Tokyo Drift), and Elsa Patakay (Elena) all return for a even more packed Fast and Furious movie. When Toretto and his team join forces with Hobbs (The Rock) you know this is going to one heck of an action packed ride your in for. Hobbs knows only the best drivers can help him get the job done of capturing this criminal (Luke Evans). This movie is even more action packed from start to finish than the last one. Sure there are a few over the top moments as the previous one, but it is still one awesome ride. Just like the original film that started it all, this latest installment will entertain you and keep you on the edge of your seat. Just when you think the movies over they throw in a twist which bring on even more action and drama. I don't want to give away the ending for those who haven't seen it, but be advised to stay for a minute or so after the credits to see what is in store for the next installment, which also ties everything up just perfect and bridging Tokyo Drift to the present day. Also with the addition of Jason S. the next Fast and Furious movie is going to be just as good if not better! Special thanks to Paul and Vin for keeping this franchise alive, because without you guys it wouldn't be the same.

Updated 12/9/2013 RIP Paul Walker, and thank you for taking me and so many others on this amazing journey with you. You were like family to many of us as you came in to our living rooms and we bonded with you and the crew. Fast and Furious will never be the same without you. You were one of my favorite actors and will sadly be missed. God bless you bro!",1369353600,171,2325,4.284090909090909

A lot of action and a part or two that brought tears to my eyes... I can't wait to BUY THIS MOVIE!!!  he best part of these films (outside of the cars) is waiting to see in what direction the story will be taken next. Like the popular Marvel films, the Fast & Furious franchise has adopted the ""scene after the credits"" to help set up the lead-in for the next film. For example, Fast & Furious was a direct lead-in to Fast Five, while Fast Five's ending saw the return of Eva Mendes to drop the bombshell about Letty still being alive - and well, Tokyo Drift supposedly taking place out of order is just plain strange (especially since viewers already know the ultimate fate of Han). How does Fast & Furious 6 end? Well, you'll have to go to the theater to get the answer to that question, but let's just say a HUGE A-list actor will be taking the reins in Fast 7 as the main villain. This scene also ties up a MAJOR loose end from Tokyo Drift that wasn't even a loose end at the time. Sound confusing? Well, go watch the film and ask questions after.

Overall, Fast & Furious 6 is a terrific addition to the franchise, featuring no shortage of big engines, big thrills - and a rather large tank. Team Torreto continues to hit on all cylinders and will easily cross the finish line at the box office with another victory under their belt - paving the way for next year's sequel (which everyone will be clamoring about after the final scene of the film). Feel free to buy your tickets in advance, because Fast & Furious 6 is a MUST SEE.",1369353600,40,1696,4.2092307692307696

5986687,4,B00FF9SKSK,"***1/2:

  Director Justin Lin got this series back on the right track with Fast Five and his Fast & Furious 6 is actually even better. He saved the series by having it be more than just about fast cars, hot women and street races. The Italian Job style plots are actually working pretty well for this series and breathed new life into it. 6 movies may seem unnecessary but at least part 5 and 6 aren't boring and are actually much better than the earlier sequels of the series.
  Surprisingly the strongest thing about this one though isn't the action but the chemistry between Vin Diesel and Michellle Rodriguez. They share some heart felt scenes where he tries to remind her who she is and where she came from. Since she lost her memory and is in with a bad crew now. Still, maybe Justin Lin should stop and just let this series end on a good a note and breath some new life into a series that needs it like....Die Hard!",1369353600,7,923,4.343023255813954
5986688,1,B00FF9SKSK,"If you have seen one of these, you have seen them all. The usual collection of meatheads creates filler scenes between unrealistic stunts. The film basically has team GI Joe versus team Cobra fighting over COBRA's weather dominator. Nobody is in jail. The dead rise from the grave. They spend about half the film trying to convince everyone how great Michelle Rodriguez is and how much we should care about her being back. Oddly enough, it was in many ways a better GI Joe Movie than the last GI Joe movie.

Vin Diesel just needs to go away. Dwayne Johnson is overexposed, always plays the same character in every film he does and is getting really annoying. They provided paychecks to lots of supporting actors for no particular reason. They seem to have brought back a couple just to show them how unimportant they are now that Michelle is back. But the films have proved that none of these people are important at all. Any of them can be killed or brought back at any time. They are just filler.

The post-credit scene is an i-don't-care moment. They fill us in on events nobody remembers from a film few liked. Then they roll out the new bum of the week for our loveable meatheads to crush next time. ....And this time its personal! Other things I didn't like were the lingering shots of certain actors, the stunts looking more silly than ever before. I keep thinking that they will do something interesting or come back to something more real. But I don't think it will ever happen now.",1369267200,18,1491,4.559701492537314
5986689,4,B00FF9SKSK,"Usually, the longer a film franchise carries on, the more diluted it becomes - eventually leading to recasts, reboots, and whatever other attempt movie studios can think of to preserve their moneymakers.  Just a few of the franchises that have had to reinvent themselves over the years includes James Bond, Batman, and basically any of the popular horror series.  Outside of the horror genre, most of the series additions these days are above average or at least average in terms of quality, with The Dark Knight and Skyfall being a few of the best examples, compared to Batman & Robin and Die Another Day being examples of their polar opposites.  Now, let's turn our attention to the Fast & Furious franchise.  After the release of The Fast and the Furious (2001), the franchise clearly took a tumble without Vin Diesel in the driver's seat, spawning two mediocre (yet successful) sequels before ""rebooting"" with the original cast in Fast & Furious and Fast Five.  The majority of that cast returns once again in the fifth sequel, Fast & Furious 6.

Directed by Justin Lin (Fast & Furious, Fast Five), Fast & Furious 6 stars Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto, along with Paul Walker as Brian O'Conner - reunited once again when Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) approaches them for help to take down a rival crew, run by Owen Shaw (Luke Evans).  Shaw's crew also includes Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez), Dom's former girlfriend that was allegedly killed while assisting the FBI - who has been suffering from amnesia since her supposed fatal car accident.  With official pardons being used as collateral to clear their names, Toretto, O'Conner, and the rest of their crew must assist Hobbs in stopping Shaw and his crew from stealing components to assemble a devastating weapon that would have the ability to knock out electronically crash an entire region.  Jordana Brewster, Gina Carano, Sung Kang, Gal Gadot, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, and Tyrese Gibson also star in supporting roles.

After the conclusion of Tokyo Drift, it would have been hard to imagine the Fast & Furious franchise surviving long enough to make another film - but here we are, three sequels later with another on the way in 2014.  To be honest, Fast & Furious (2009) didn't have a whole lot going for it other than it reunited the original cast, but it was enough of a commercial success to spawn Fast Five, which is by far and away the best film of the franchise.  With that being said, it was always going to be a massive undertaking to exceed the entertainment value of Fast Five.  However, Fast & Furious 6 definitely gives Fast Five a run for its money - due in large part to the addition of another crew that is just as talented as Toretto's crew, not to mention the return of Michelle Rodriguez.

Fast & Furious 6 is basically split down the center with two different plots coinciding with one another, the first being the crew assisting Hobbs to take down the Shaw gang, and the second to return Michelle Rodriguez's character to her once prominent position as one of the franchise's main characters.  The Letty storyline is a bit silly when you really think about it, but then again the whole franchise is pretty silly in itself - since basically all of the characters should either be dead or in jail.  Still, the storyline works enough to get Rodriguez back in the mix and to be completely honest, the franchise was really lacking the role of a dominant female that Gal Gadot and Elsa Pataky had been desperately trying to fulfill in the past two sequels.  Now that Letty is back in full swing, ***SPOILER - it should be no surprise to see that Gadot and Pataky were essentially written out of the franchise by the conclusion of Fast Six***

It's not as though the Fast & Furious films are overly impressive with the overall quality of acting or meaningful dramatization (they star Vin Diesel and Paul Walker for cryin' out loud), so it shouldn't be too surprising that these films have taken on a watered-down, soap opera-ish feel to them.  Regardless, viewers are obviously invested in these characters, clearly having fallen in love with them and continuing to want to know what happens to them.  At the same time, you have to wonder how long these films can keep going at the rate they are progressing - because no matter how many times a character says their predicament presents ""another level"" of difficulty, it still feels the same as the last film.  That's not to say these films aren't exciting, because they absolutely are, but the more action these films dish out, the harder it will be to get to the finish line the next time around.

The best part of these films (outside of the cars) is waiting to see in what direction the story will be taken next.  Like the popular Marvel films, the Fast & Furious franchise has adopted the ""scene after the credits"" to help set up the lead-in for the next film.  For example, Fast & Furious was a direct lead-in to Fast Five, while Fast Five's ending saw the return of Eva Mendes to drop the bombshell about Letty still being alive - and well, Tokyo Drift supposedly taking place out of order is just plain strange (especially since viewers already know the ultimate fate of Han).  How does Fast & Furious 6 end?  Well, you'll have to go to the theater to get the answer to that question, but let's just say a HUGE A-list actor will be taking the reins in Fast 7 as the main villain.  This scene also ties up a MAJOR loose end from Tokyo Drift that wasn't even a loose end at the time.  Sound confusing?  Well, go watch the film and ask questions after.

5986809,5,B00FF9SKSK,This whole franchise is awesome. There's a reason it's so successful. Not sure why people crap on it.,1492387200,,101,4.666666666666667
5986810,4,B00FF9SKSK,"This movie gives away every main scene from the first 5 movies (well not the stupid Tokyo Drift one but you can understand why they left that out) which is good if you haven't seen them in getting caught up with the plot, but then again, you know everything that happened in them if you're watching them out of order.  This one picks up a year or so I guess after the events in five, and brings all that film's characters back.  It even brings back a character that died in the fourth film as the motivation to risk their lives when they don't financially need to ever worry again.

Although none of these movies have exactly been realistic, this one is cartoon like at times.  Characters can be flung (or jump) flying through the air and land on their backs uninjured. It also doesn't hide the fact that innocent motorists are killed, previous movies in the franchise they likely were too of course but you could kind of imagine the drivers survived. The final half hour or so takes place under or inside a plane that is speeding along a runway taking off.",1491523200,,1057,4.43298969072165

However, as a mom and parent, can I say super predictable plot and a little corny story line? But never mind, the action and awesome cars are what these mocvies are all about.  It was entertaining, and we got a kick out of the endless airport runway scene at the end of the movie.  Literally the last twenty or so minutes of the movie was a plane taking off on with a battle between the good guys and the bad  the whole time.  Must have been the worlds longest runway.

5987085,5,B00FF9SKSK,"I have watched all of the Fast & Furious movies this far including 7. this was defineltyl a blockbuster to watch i was surprised that the new villian Jason Statham was appearing. This movie is a watch and not miss. so much action from beginning to end that it was clearly a match to all the other sequels and the last it made sense that i had to watch Fast & Furious 6 before even tempting myself to watch Fast & Furious 7.  I hoping that they will continue on with sequels just like they do with horror movies such as Friday the 13th (distgusting movie ) has so many sequels you wanna throw up. I just wanna see more of Fast & Furious such as and up to Fast & Furious 13 or 20 ..That would be wild and crazy to keep this movie going. I know for a fact I would enjoy and await all of them.

I am loving the fact the it has the same actors and actresses. I am hoping in Fast & Furious 8 they will bring back the two men from 1-3 that gambled all the time. they made it interesting as well knowing how to blow things up such as that toilet in the police station bathroom. to steal the safe. that was great action.

I myself do not always mind if you know big major stunts or affects, but the movie has stayed true to the personal lives between all the characters, and the fact that they are once again being asked to put your skills to use, to  accomplish something major.

 And each movie has gotten even better, cooler, funnier, and even more action-packed since number five.

 And of course, whether you're a fan of movies whether it be seeing them are buying them, or a fan of collectible packaging, you can't go wrong with the steel book case edition. Great if you're able to get your hands on it.",1454716800,,647,4.5344827586206895

11/8/15

   why do you give fast and furious 5 stars 
 is because its one of the very many action movies that is my favorite movies of all time it always keeps me excited to watch it all the time theres 7 different movies so you can watch a different one each time they all have a new mission in every movie but the 6th one is my favorite cause theres more action then in the rest but 7 is also good to but I give them 5 stars because theres a lot of new fast cars and new people each movie ..I think fast and furious is the best action movie because it always leaves you wondering what happened next fast and furious is the best action movie it always leaves you wondering who there gonna catch next or what kind of new fast car there gonna  get and most importantly I thinks the best movie because they treat each other like family and always has each others back threw anything and they make it to the end with each other . I can connect my reason to this because every single fast and furious movies always gets really high ratings on the movie and the best action movie and its important those movies always wanting to know what happened in the next movie or why they let some go . Fast and furious is about fast cars and missions and family as of right now theres 7 fast and furious movies and theres about to be 8 movies but in every movie they get new cars and a new mission in a new city or country they never know where there going and thats what makes the movie so good because you don't know whats gonna happen or where there going you don't know any of that until they go on the misson . I remember in this scene where where one of them comes in contact with the bad guy who has one of there guys and she doesnt remember anything so she works with the bad and they are trying to get her so they crash cars and and ruin roads and everything is a mess and they catch the guy and take him to jail . I give this 5 stars because its the best action movie in my option its has lots of fast cars and a lot of action going on at once so it s the best movie to watch if you like fast cars and friends who treat each other like family .",1449792000,,2174,3.967889908256881

5987197,4,B00FF9SKSK,"I watched this mainly to see one of the last films Paul Walker made. I've seen all the fast n furious films, you've seen one, you've seen them all. Car chases, pyro technics, crazy blow up scenes and things that go kaboom...all the things you'd expect from a winning recipe from hollywood A-listers in a blockbuster movie chain. It delivered all those elements...but once they start making 3,4...5 movies of the same formula, it gets repetitive and predictable. And that is the case here. But I did love to get that opportunity to see Paul Walker perform again one last time. And for that it gets 4 stars verses 3.

5987280,5,B00FF9SKSK,This movie has an all-star cast withnonstop action with a good story line it's too bad some of the stunts were a little far fetched they did a great job on Paul Walker's final film.

5987295,1,B00FF9SKSK,"Honestly, only eight year olds would actually enjoy this movie in my opinion. The lever of way over-done fake testosterone is quite fake and comical such as the macho glances, the slow-moving-speech when the character is supposed to be ""cool"", the overblown ""action"" sequences that I found very annoying- I just wanted each action scene to end already- been there done that seen it a million times before- totally boring (but very annoying like a mosquito flying around your face). I am absolutely a Duane Johnson fan, as is my girlfriend, but he was ""not even there"" on this one"". (You will chuckle when you see him walk with arms splayed out - you know- like a guy who has no ""lats"" is trying to display his width- He does not have to do that! Only little boys and skinny men do that when they are ""acting poorly""...And Vin only adds to the circus of extremely forced acting and bad dialogue. I love action movies - Segal, Bronson, James Bond (Daniel Craig in Casion Royale)- stuff that is at least well done with some style. I was so disappointed with Fast Six- what a waste!",1443571200,,1078,4.533333333333333
5987296,5,B00FF9SKSK,"Another great addition to the series! I managed to catch this on Amazon for $10.99, which to me was an awesome deal to get both the Blu-ray and DVD together.

But after the series got over that disaster the story lines kept getting better. This seems to be an unstoppable success story, which will continue to bring classic drivers cars out of oblivion, making new fast for the old classics which should be preserved for the future in a world where cars are looking like bars of soap. As long as this franchise can keep up with the feel good action and showing the use of nasty cars and chic girls combined with an effective story which includes the classic car chases, this will deliver the thrills.",1438128000,,641,4.5344827586206895

Stay to the end to understand 7 better.

The line totally ignores every thing else that just happened and its a CAR movie what else would be there.

Turning Point: A Compelling Vision",1428019200,,223,5.371428571428571
5987579,5,B00FF9SKSK,"I think my favorite thing about Fast and Furious 6 is, that even though with this film they have officially reached a ""Transformers"" level of big, and have proceeded to change their craft accordingly, they still stick with the same cast of somewhat unknown faces and the same characters that have been around for, at this point, 12 years. I know for most people that's probably obvious, but I don't know, I just think that there's something kind of nice about that.
When Hobbs(Dwayne Johnson) informs Dom(Vin Diesel) that Letty is still alive and is running as the second in command in a gang of dangerous criminals led by Owen Shaw, who is trying to build a deadly weapon; Dom, Brian(Paul Walker) and the rest of the team must join forces with Hobbs; for if they can help him get Shaw, he will help them get Letty and give them worldwide pardons, so they can return home.
This is the film where the series not only became really big, but also really started to mature. They are officially on a mainstream, big budget action movie level now, and a sense of maturity and focus follows that we haven't seen in this franchise before.
Also, the plot is hands down the best of the six films! I was impressed with the writing.
This film really started to focus on themes of family(a theme that is supposed to become a lot bigger in Furious 7, which comes out today!)
The best line in the movie: Dom(After getting shot by Letty): ""You don't give up on family, even if they do.""
I was very surprised that this wasn't going to be a heist film. I thought for sure they were just going to copy what Fast Five did, but no, this was an all out action film. Not a Street racing film. Not a heist film. Nothing but action, which is great!
Vin Diesel shines now more then ever as Dom. Paul Walker gives another strong performance as Brian. Dwayne Johnson is impassively charismatic as Hobbs and Luke Evans gives a fresh and charismatic performance as Owen Shaw, a villain who is equally fresh and charismatic.
The character development is great. Hobbs is the character who is always going through the most change. When we first meet him in the beginning of the 5th film, he is determined to arrest Dom and Brian, not caring if they are guilty or innocent. At the end of this film, (SPOILER ALERT) Hobbs holds a military general at gunpoint to help save the life of a women he barley knows. He's a great character. They are all great characters! Going on adventures with these guys would not be half as fun if the characters were anything less than what they are.
But no matter how big the team or franchise get or how many big stars come in, at the end of the day, its always about Dom and Brian. Thats the best part about the film. They are always giving Brian stuff to do. He never becomes just another member of the team.  I honestly cant imagine what the series is going to be like without Brian. Dom and Brian are two halfs of a whole. Seeing Dom alone is going to be very, very different.
Leo and Santos don't return for some unknown reason. Their mentioned once though.
The death toll in this one is high, and by that I mean two team members meet their demise in this film(although, one of them we already knew about, if you catch my DRIFT.)(Sorry, no italics.)
The action scenes are beyond outstanding. In his fourth and final Fast and Furious film as director, Justin Lin definitely goes out with an enourmas bang. The action could not be any more impressive and will blow you away.
And of course, what would a sequel to Fast Five be without humor, and trust me, this film definitely packs it's fair share of hilarious moments.
This is a great, great movie!",1428019200,,3650,4.439642324888227

5987588,5,B00FF9SKSK,"This blu-ray seems to often be under $10, and it is a great deal at that price!  I think the movie itself is incredibly entertaining.  Lots of action (the Rock entertains as always) and great sound.  I've seen all of the F&F movies, and I think this one is my favorite.  I can barely even remember the second and fourth movies, but I think the others are good.  The fifth and sixth (this one) were probably the most polished out of all of them.

This also isn't a testosterone-only movie, with the ladies also getting pretty darn bad-a** in a number of scenes.  There's also a twist in it that I didn't see coming at all, which is nice because a lot of action movies telegraph the plot so well that a three year old would be hard pressed to be surprised.  This movie was not like that.

There was also a set up in the plot for the Tokyo Drift movie, which (if you haven't seen it, or any since then) was chronologically out of order in terms of story lines.  Tokyo Drift, although it was the third movie, occurs after this movie in the F&F world.  (My guess is that they made it before getting the original cast to return, but I don't really know.)

Overall, I give this a huge recommendation.  The blu-ray/DVD combo pack currently costs only $8, and it's a steal at that price.  If you like action movies, I think that you'll really enjoy this one.  I also don't think that you really have to have seen the other movies first in order to like it, either.",1427500800,,1455,4.278388278388278

Besides the FAST & FURIOUS films what is your favorite VIN DIESEL movie my favorite one is XXX starring VIN DIESEL, DANNY TREJO, AND SAMUEL JACKSON (2002). After you've watched the movie FAST & FURIOUS 6 click onto the additional features section for some cool behind the scenes footage, here is a trivia question for you this is a good one what action-packed movie did GINA CARANO star in and kicked a lot of male but, the answer is in my P.S.

F&F6 reunites just about every character the franchise had to offer.  London is the backdrop of this movie.  Letty now has no memory, lost from an accident when she was inserted into a drug operation.  Dom tries to win her heart and all the others are having around because they know F&F makes money.",1421539200,,521,4.5978260869565215

I purchased this one as a gift for him but I had never really cared for these types of movies because I'm  more of an love story romance or comedy movies type but I was not much of a online shopper on purchasing DVD or CD'S other than from stores due to skepticism of them not being of good quality and a craftsmanship and I just didn't want to have to be bothered with returning them due to not being sure of the headaches of returns etc... however after watching the movie it was a great purchase with which the quality of craftsmanship and durability with great video and audio and I felt very pleased with my purchase and I will highly recommend it to everybody and I will Never be Skeptical again of making purchases from your online website again!!

The action speeds with no let up. A cop wants to capture a criminal involved in a crime that could affect the entire world. He needs the help of Vin Diesel and his ""family."" Vin Diesel wants to retire and at first refuses, but the cop shows him a picture of a woman who he thought was dead, who he loved, who is inexplicably working with the criminal, and he agrees. He gathers his ""family"" together for a fast and furious adventure that viewers who like action flicks will enjoy.",1419811200,,637,4.229508196721311

Really enjoy the characters and the actors who play them. Sure, they've evolved into an almost ""Ocean's 11"" caper ensemble, and the action sequence that ends this film is so wildly over-the-top, but like I said, they're a lot of fun. Enjoy!

To me, this one ranks in the middle. I still like the grittier first film the best.",1409184000,,450,4.421686746987952

5987976,2,B00FF9SKSK,"Of course this is a must watch movie, since it is the last of the series with the late Paul Walker.

Other than that, there is nothing new about it.
Over muscled men, beautiful women and Michelle Rodriguez that fits somewhere in between!!

The story is typical. The gang is gathered to help the USA authorities (their former nemesis that is)
to get to another gang that is seeking to steal some ultra powerful weapon components.
So, the car chases with the awesome classic muscle cars are accompanied with full auto firing
and explosions, making it a nice action movie to watch. Of course there is the love affair part
which is kind of a nuisance,  but hey it is a Hollywood movie.
Also, this time they over do it with some scenes, especially with the tank-on-the-bridge incident,
which is one of the most far-fetched non James Bond  special effect ever!

All in all it is a fun movie to watch, especially if you are a car enthusiast or an action movie person.
Of course, as the final scene suggests, there is a 7th movie coming so fun of the series will have something to look forward to.",1408492800,,1089,4.47979797979798

5988118,4,B00FF9SKSK,"I discovered this series only recently when I happend to catch ""Fast 5"" on cable about a year ago. Since that time I've gone back and watched the entire series and have really enjoyed each entry. With that said, I think ""Fast & Furious 6"" may be my favorite entry in the series.

Following right on the events of part 5, it looks as though Dom and his crew can finally retire to the good life. The only hitch is that they cannot return to America or they'll be arrested. Agent Hobbs and his partner Hicks show up on Dom's doorstep after investigating a hit on a Russian military convoy, they don't suspect Dom or his team, but instead want Dom's help in finding the crew that did pull the heist. Dom isn't interested until he learns that Letty, Dom's old girlfriend, who he thought was dead, may be involved. Dom picks up the phone and in exchange for a complete pardon for past crimes, his crew will help track down those responsible for hijacking the convoy.

Filled with speaker pumping music, fantastic cars, awesome special effects and jaw-dropping scenery, ""Fast & Furious 6"" shows just how far this series has come from the simplisitic ""undground car racing"" scenario laid out in the first films. This is an exciting heist film, that will keep you glued to your seat for its whole running time.

The stunt work in this film is amazing, and worth the price of the DVD alone. If you love great car chase sequences, you're in luck, this movie is PACKED with 'em. If you've not seen the earlier films in this series, I do recommend you at least watch ""Fast 5"" before giving this one a view as the events of that film clearly impact what happens here. Also, be sure to hang in for the after credit sequence which is just amazing!! Highly recommended.",1402358400,,1752,4.4858934169279
5988119,5,B00FF9SKSK,"Great for action and the characters are

Story jumped around alot of different places and is good if your watching Jumper or Quantum Leap or are ADD or something. The chick scene was much better in 5 and I thought the intro music with more drum beats helped get the adrenaline running better prior to watching repeatedly.

I recommend it. It definitely is worth every penny you put into it. And then you can watch it again for less then you'd spend for a couple or family to go to the movies.",1399507200,,548,4.525252525252525

5988172,4,B00FF9SKSK,I miss Paul walker. Love it or hate it this franchise is a cultural phenomenon/export. This movie was a bit depressing because of Paul Walker's passing around the time of the dvd release. Also in the movie some long standing time line questions (with respect to the different movies) are addressed which adds to the sadness. Good movie but it is the end of an era. Can't believe there are 6 (7?) of these movies. May Mr. Walker rest in peace.,1399507200,,442,4.469135802469136

5988176,5,B00FF9SKSK,We took our smaller boys to the theater to watch the movie and they both wound up falling asleep towards the end.  Probably due to the busy day and big dinner we had before we went.  I already had a box set for 1-5 and this was perfect for a Christmas gift.  It was packaged nicely and was exactly what I ordered.,1399334400,,313,4.016129032258065
5988177,5,B00FF9SKSK,"Just like a fine wine, the Fast and Furious series gets better with age.  The latest installment of this world renown feature, Fast and Furious 6, is an absolute must see for many reasons.  Justin Lin, the director, brings back Toretto (Vin Diesel), OConner (Paul Walker), and the rest of the gang  transforming these familiar characters to whole new personas.  Usually they are on the other side of the law looking to create absolute chaos for law enforcement and to earn a personal profit.  In this action packed film the gang is brought in by their once enemy and law enforcer Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) to help catch a band of criminals who are robbing banks dry in London.  This is a complete, ironic twist because to Hobbs, Toretto and his gang are all fugitives who Hobbs is supposed to bring back to the United States for trial.  The only reason he abandons his legal obligation to arrest the gang is because he knows that they are the best precision drivers in the world and the only ones capable of catching the high paced robbers.
 First thing is first, the director and producers could not have picked better settings to shoot this film.  Each and every scene was created expertly, to every last detail.  Whether it be the placement of cars, people or even a chair, everything always seemed to be in the perfect place.  Along with this director's and producers' exceptional scene planning, the script was also flawless.  Each line was delivered at the right time, either to deliver some satire or add some new emotional dimension to a scene.  It was really an amazing team effort with how deeply thought out the whole movie was.
 Dominic Toretto is played masterfully by Vin Diesel in the Fast and Furious saga.  Toretto is a man who is tough as nails, but believes that family prevails over everything.  Diesel was able to portray this tenderhearted warrior using on point facial expressions, voice tones, and masterful body language throughout the movie. He brings this macho feel to the movie because of his sheer size and the attitude he demonstrates in his interactions with people throughout the movie.  It is definitely one of the best performances by Diesel to date.
 Paul Walker also put forth an amazing character in Brian OConner.  He looks the part of a pretty boy that has a nose for adventure and trouble, and that is exactly who OConner is.  He absolutely makes this movie with his perfect acting performance.  Whether in the delivery of his lines or even a small smile at the perfect time, Walker made the movie feel like you were actually there.  He makes every emotion and scene he is involved in so lifelike and real that it makes the most unreal action sequences seem believable.
 Dwayne Johnson is hands down the manliest man on the face of the earth.  His nickname in real life is The Rock, but it might as well be ""The Mountain.""  This guy is built like a tank and makes his character, special forces agent Hobbs, one of the most intimidating people in one might ever encounter.  Johnson portrays the role of a hard, no games agent perfectly.  Hobbs does not take no for an answer and he always anticipates your next move before you do.  He is fearless in every circumstance and at times emotionless, but due to The Rock's extreme muscular build, he plays the role of Hobbs almost effortlessly.
 The main villain in the movie, Owen Shaw, is an absolute mastermind.  He creates machines and diversions to foil any chance of catching him and his crew.  He knows what makes people tick and uses his intuitive wisdom against them in any way he can.  Shaw is played by a Welshmen named,  Luke Evans.  He provided this film with a flawless ultimate bad guy performance that is one to remember.
 The rest of the cast is full of unbelievable talent.  The bond and chemistry that the team has formed throughout the Fast and Furious saga is so real and carried out by each character perfectly.  They each add a different element to the movie that takes the movie from amazing, to absolutely unbelievable.  While the rest of the cast does not play a huge role like Walker or Diesel, they improve the movie nonetheless.
 Beyond the acting, the film itself is filled with endless action and spectacular special effects which leave the viewer amazed and in complete awe, keeping the audience engrossed in the highly-charged scenes.  Justin Lin wanted many of the action sequences to be performed by actors and stunt performers, rather than computer generating them.  For example, in one scene a tank on a bridge running over cars and destroying everything in its path.  This scene was not created via special effects but instead actually happened in the filming process.  The superior acting, as well as the dramatic, thrilling action sequences, and the awesome, creative special effects that endlessly fill this movie, will leave your jaw dropped with how amazing Fast and Furious 6 truly is.",1399334400,,4910,4.733804475853946
5988178,5,B00FF9SKSK,I got this as a present for a friend. It came packaged well and the price was good.  They are very happy with it,1399334400,,112,3.6666666666666665

5988180,5,B00FF9SKSK,Never thought I would get into this Movie Series.  I bought the first movie for my son upon his request.  I loved the first movie and have continued to buy them.,1399161600,,161,4.161290322580645
5988181,5,B00FF9SKSK,"I'm a huge fan of the series, and all I can say is that I love the sixth and am dying for the seventh. I also had a long period of shock, denial, and mourning over Paul Walker's passing.

Speaking to the movie, I love it, and many will probably argue with me or for me. Regardless, the movie did well in theaters, and even after the passing of one of the main actors, there will be another sequel: these are facts, not opinions.

Now the steel book is really cool, you get the DVD, Blu-Ray, and Special features, very typical of these kinds of special editions. Again I'm a huge fan, so everything there is just great for such a fan like me.

Amazon got it to me the day it was out in stores, because I had it pre-ordered. Kudos and praise to their delivery system. It fit in my mailbox to my surprise.

Finally I want to mention one of the ads that run before you get to the Blu-Ray menu. It shows a promo for Fast 7, and Paul Walker was in the promo. This was made before the accident on Thanksgiving weekend that took his life, so it goes with the original plan for 7,8, and 9 to be released in three subsequent years. The plans changed to reflect the loss and mourning times, so now 7 is coming out in '15, and then plans may be made for further releases. Now I think its really cool that that ad is there, and it may in time become a collector's item, because they didn't remove this ad from the disks.

As a final ""Easter egg"", if you have a Blu-Ray player that can connect to the internet, the first ad to pop up on the Blu-Ray will be a beautiful tribute to Paul Walker. I really like it, and even though its technically not on the disk, I always watch it before starting the movie.",1398902400,,1690,4.109090909090909
5988182,5,B00FF9SKSK,"What can I say, it is Fast & Furious. If you want action, watch this. So much Vin Diesel and Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnson butt-kicking.",1398902400,,132,4.32

5988184,5,B00FF9SKSK,"I have been a huge fan from the first movie, watching them all over and over again. This one was even more sentimental as I received it after the death of Paul of course. The next one will be even more special.

5988220,5,B00FF9SKSK,Best movie with the best sequel and it is so tragic that Paul Walker died ironically in a fast car. It makes this movie even more special and worth keeping in memory of the great star who captivated the audience.,1397692800,,212,4.325
5988221,4,B00FF9SKSK,"Fast Five was truly the best in the series, and did well to reboot the franchise, which this movie capitalized on.  The previous movie was action that revolved around a great story, but this movie was the opposite, as we're the first four.  Despite this I still enjoyed this movie a lot, and look forward the 7th movie that will be coming to theatures soon.  Even though this movie is not as good as the one before it it was still better than some of the others in this franchise.  I could have lived without the producers bringing someone back from the dead, but at least they made resurrection semi plausible, and didn't dwell on that fact for the whole movie.  I enjoyed this movie but the experience is bittersweet with the death of Paul Walker.  Still recommend, but don't expect it to be the best.",1397606400,,803,4.465753424657534
5988222,5,B00FF9SKSK,As the last full movie with Paul Walker it is a fitting tribute to his carrier. as he grew with the franchise he grew as an actor. this is a must own along with the others in the series. can not wait for 7 to come out. and I hope they do not end the franchise but find a way to keep it going as it inspires gear heads now and in the future.,1397606400,,340,3.608108108108108

I busted a gut laughing at least a dozens, because they were so ridiculously inane and/or horribly acted. Though I can't blame the actors, you can only do so much if you're given a script that's a steaming pile of manure. Even with the parts that were laugh out loud stupid giving me a little bit of entertainment here and there, this movie was painful to watch.

It's quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen.",1397347200,,618,4.508928571428571

5988276,3,B00FF9SKSK,"Fast & Furious 6 was pretty entertaining, lots of stunts of course, special effects, and picked up where Fast & Furious 5 left off ( as far as story line and overall entertainment) I think they needed as many of the stars from the original Fast & Furious to pull this off, and the addition of ""The Rock"" was pretty cool. But for me, nothing still surpasses the original Fast & Furious movie. ""Too Fast and Too Furious, Fast 5, and FAST & furious 6 were all pretty good, but were never able to capture what the original did...For me anyway. And now sadly with Paul Walker no longer with us, it will be interesting to see where go, if they continue the Fast & Furious movies moving forward. I know they were working on the next movie, when he died....",1396483200,,749,4.319148936170213

Vin Diesel?  Loved him from the first and love him still.  If he's in a movie, I'm gonna watch it!  And the rest of the cast adds so much intrigue and fun.

5988438,4,B00FF9SKSK,"Six is a great sequel movie to the other five. Most sequel movies let me say are not so good from past experience on other movies I have liked. The only downside in my opinion is that the character of Dom went after a more lesbian caste Letty, (reason for the 4 stars). Dom gives up the hottie from Brazil for the darkside Letty was a real let down for me. But that said, the action is great the end not so much. Five is my favorite of the series.",1393718400,,447,3.977777777777778

5988442,3,B00FF9SKSK,"Fun to watch, but a bit on the corny side. The Rock's performance is surprisingly good for someone who didn't start out as an actor. And, as always, Vin Diesel is tough, yet charming, and very believable in the role. I was also glad to see Michelle Rodriguez back. The bad guy, played by Luke Evans, is also good, and very sexy! I just wish he'd pick better movies (anyone seen The Raven? Ugh!).",1393545600,,395,4.351351351351352

The HD looked good on our TV.

The streaming performance was poor.  The streaming throughput started out fine.  About 1/3 of the way into the movie, it dropped down to less than 3mbps.  The movie kept halting and having to buffer.after that.

I checked my ISP speed during one of these, and the ISP was delivering well above 3mbps.

Knowing this is the last of the series in which he makes an appearance throughout the movie altered my perception as I watched.

Terrible accident that Paul will not be in any other ones because he made the movie what it is along with the rest of the cast. Part 7 will be very interesting on how they do the huge loss.

Anyway maybe it got better after the first hour, I'll have to wait another time to explore this one.",1392595200,,463,4.261363636363637

5988555,3,B00FF9SKSK,"I guess that any good show runs out of realistic stunts eventually and in this case they've crossed over into the unbelievable. The $6 rental fee was too much, it is only worth $3.",1392595200,,180,4.323529411764706

5988558,5,B00FF9SKSK,Fast and furious 6 was a great comeback after so many years. The plot was amazing and it really kept me involved and entertained. Its a shame Paul Walker had to die but Vin Diesel really is powerful in his role. A fun action packed story for all to enjoy.,1392508800,,255,4.12
5988559,5,B00FF9SKSK,Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are great actors and it was really hard to accept the death of Paul. So I bought the movie they made together all the movies were great movies I have seen them all and love them.,1392508800,,205,4.024390243902439

5988567,5,B00FF9SKSK,The DVD was in great shape and the movie was action packed. A few stunts were a bit out of the realm of possibility but that just made it fun and after 4 of these movies ( i say 4 because the one in Tokyo should not be apart of this) it's great to see they are still coming out with new ways to make race racing and stealing fun fun fun,1392336000,,336,3.6805555555555554

5988570,5,B00FF9SKSK,"This movie is rather surprising as you would think the 6th entry of this franchise would make the series seem rather stale.  However with it's great cast, intriguing plot, and great action scenes, this movie is a thrill ride that is worth the watch.  It's rather nice that the series has just embraced some of it's own silliness and over the top action and just let it fly.  The cast works well together so there is humor, a sense of family, and also it sets up quite nicely for Furious 7.",1392336000,,489,4.351648351648351

5988579,5,B00FF9SKSK,This movie is the best in the franchise so far . All the character are finally given equal time and the way they help with the plot makes the movie flow really well.

still really good.  Because of the untimely death of Paul, I'm happy I collected all of them.",1391472000,,212,4.170731707317073
5988631,4,B00FF9SKSK,"This was a good and entertaining movie. I was getting a little sick of these after so many, but I decided to give it a shot again. Yeah some of the theatrics were a little outlandish, but if you're just looking for some entertainment, this movie will do the trick. It has some good twists and keeps the action sequences in check. Not too much to overstimulate and not too little that you get board. It's worth watching this one.",1391472000,,428,4.3625
5988632,5,B00FF9SKSK,"LOVED IT, ALL ACTORS ARE EXCEPTIONAL, SO SAD THAT WE LOST PAUL WALKER.... HE HAD A PROMISING FURTURE, MAY HE REST IN PEACE!!!",1391472000,,125,4.478260869565218
5988633,5,B00FF9SKSK,5 stars for the purchase itself.  I love the steel packaging since this is one of my favorite movie series.  It looks great on my dvd rack.  I also like that this product was cheaper than the retail stores!,1391472000,,206,4.230769230769231
5988634,5,B00FF9SKSK,Arrived on time.  Packaging was very classy with the hardened case. True collector's item.  Blu ray format is full 1080 and audio is top notch. The extras on the disc are worth it alone (Gearheads dream!!). For a fan of the series this is a must buy.,1391472000,,250,4.297872340425532
5988635,3,B00FF9SKSK,"Ever since The Rock has been in this series of movies, they've become just like many other action movies with big shoot-outs.  I actually would like the series to go back when the movie focused more on the characters and fast cars rather than gun battles.",1391472000,,255,4.543478260869565

5988638,3,B00FF9SKSK,This entire movie encourages wild and reckless stunts. There is a disclaimer at the end of the movie but no one will probably see it or care about it. There is no way a person can jump from one level of a bridge to a lower level while catching another person and survive. Windshields are not trampolines.  The tank was really cool though. In the end I loved seeing Paul Walker one last time but the movie was just too much for me.,1391472000,,430,4.180722891566265

5988659,4,B00FF9SKSK,"I rated this movie so high due to how great it was in connect with the series.  I admit I had not watched all FF, but the ones I did see, FF 5, I enjoyed.  FF 5 was a bit far-fetched with the dragging of the vault, but fun to watch.

  In the particular part to the series, I loved the combination of characters and that they faced an equally skilled villain.  The car chases, races, and fight scenes were all top-notch.  So truly unbelievable stunts.  Didn't like the love triangle between Michele Rod's character, Vin, and other latin actress (can't think of her name) from FF 5.  I find that the latin actress was hot and much better suited for Vin, but I understand how the story must go.  Michele Rod has been too type casted as this hard girl, always with an edge.  She is not as hot as the latin girl.

  Any ways, Paul Walker will be sorely missed as he is a good balance to Vin D in these movies.  He really made this movie awesome, especially by him becoming a dad.  He and Mia's relationship totally adds a family feel to the team.
Dwayne J is always fun to watch and glad he is on their side.  The MMA girl is super hot and her action scene are great.  Wish she could be in more of these.

  FF 7 promises to be great with the addition of Jason S.  I know they will honor Paul through the process as I'm glad I can honor him through my purchase of this movie. I'm glad I have it as a part of my collection.  Great movie.",1391299200,,1432,4.053763440860215

I think people have gotten carried away with action films and how many explosions you can create, how many chicks you can pick up and how ridiculous the story can be. They made parodies about movies like this. I did enjoy it, but you have to know what to expect and that there are 5 other Fast & Furious and they are all the same, so which is more Faster and Furious-er? Watching the 6 Fast & Furious movies are like watching 12 hours of bad acting, extravagant story lines, and expected endings...you can get the picture by watching one.",1391040000,,558,4.375

While the other earlier versions were entertaining,  this movie seems that they went one too far and should have stopped at 5.  Not that it was unwatchable, I did stay awake for the whole movie, but can't say there was anything worth remembering in it.

The only part that confused me a bit was the start up, it was on a black screen with a universal logo that would not go away until I hit Play.

5988701,5,B00FF9SKSK,"The latest and best of the Fast And Furious movies...non stop action and great interaction with the actors. Tyrese and Ludicris...oh my God, they are so funny. Vin, Rock and Paul are all bigger than life. Michelle Rodriguez well I am waiting to like her. The rest of the cast good guys and bad guys (Luke Evans, one of the most underrated and amazing actors on the screen, my opinion) are all magnificent. I will miss Paul Walker but he leaves behind a body of work anyone would be proud of.

Good performances by all of the leading cast with a touch of sadness with the release of the movie pretty much coinciding with the untimely death of Walker in real life and the upcoming dilemma of who is going to fill his former role and whether the series will have the same punch, adventure and comradery of the actors that comes through in all of the F&F series.",1390608000,,455,4.3023255813953485

5988718,4,B00FF9SKSK,"This was a fine addition to the Fast & Furious franchise. It's fast paced and filled with furious car chases, fist fights and testosterone (even the female characters). There were enough inventive surprises mixed in with the old, comfortable cliches to keep me going. Also, enormous numbers of vehicles of all kinds get destroyed.

There is something slightly weirdly poignant about it given the whole Paul Walker thing, but that seemed to add to the tone and feel of the movie for me rather than detract.",1390435200,,505,4.872093023255814
5988719,5,B00FF9SKSK,Great movie! Was very impressed! I didn't like the one in Tokyo because Vin Diesel wasn't in it. I'm glad he's back!,1390435200,,116,4.318181818181818

5988721,5,B00FF9SKSK,One of the best shows that i have seen. I can't believe that has become one of the best series of movies out there. It is the star trek of fast cars movies.,1390435200,,156,3.757575757575758

5988725,3,B00FF9SKSK,"Fast & Furious 6 gives the series rabid fan base pretty much everything it could possibly wish for: an array of uber-expensive, souped-up racecars; a heavy helping of in-group camaraderie; a bunch of super-macho posturing (even from the women); a bevy of scantily-clad, slow-motion groupies; a moderate dose of tough-guy sentiment (nothing too girly though);  a smidgen of comic relief; a raft of ear-piercing gun battles and, of course, the series patented trademark, a whole mess of turbo-charged chase scenes.

The plot - since contractual obligations demand there be one, I suppose - involves our favorite band of car racing outlaws (Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Sung Kang, Tyrese Gibson, et. al ) coming out of retirement in various foreign lands to help Dwayne Johnsons DSS agent take down an international heist gang in exchange for full immunity for the crew back in the States. Theres a lot of talk about the family and much romantic palaver between Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez, but thats basically just filler between all the spectacular (if scarcely plausible) race sequences - which is as it should be when you're fast and furious.

Fast & Furious 6 ends with one of those don't try this at home provisos, which in light of the recent tragic fate of series star Paul Walker, seems more vital and relevant than ever (not to mention ironically prescient). Heed the warning.",1390348800,,1381,4.995652173913044

5988729,3,B00FF9SKSK,It is an awlright movie. Nothing great. The Navistar truck is looking great. They need to show more races like they did before.,1390348800,,127,4.565217391304348

5988732,3,B00FF9SKSK,"If you like action with terrible acting then this is your kind of movie. The action is outstanding but, when it gets into the acting it gets rough and dry. The story line is decent, I do like that they intertwine the storys from previous movies. The new cars are nice to look at and some of the new kind of action seens will make it watchable.",1390262400,,343,4.134328358208955

5988737,4,B00FF9SKSK,For the price I paid it was a pretty good deal to get the steel case version as a collectors item. I like the three disc set so my son can download it and I have a copy that will play in my portable player for the car. The steel case isn't that great or I would have given it 5 stars.,1390262400,,284,3.596774193548387

5988741,1,B00FF9SKSK,"It has become Common Knowledge, that Vin Diesel and Justin Lin have been on a ROLL with the simple fact that they give a DAMN about the Story, the Acting, and the Quality of these Movies, all for the Sake of the FANS.

HOWEVER, I was Expecting ALOT MORE than was delivered with this movie.

There were a few ""UN-REALISTIC"" scenes, such as Jumping out of a Muscle car, OVER A BRIDGE, to catch someone in mid-air, in order to save her life... U.N. R.E.A.L...

Plus the Bad Guy not being very BAD-GUY-ish.... and some Other stuff going on that was LESS than the greatness I've come to expect.
It seemed like they were just Going through the Motions... Nothing New, Nothing Original...

And the Addition of Dwayne Johnson was an Absolutely Sickening Blow.

Atleast NOW, the story has come full circle, and in the NEXT movie, they can get BACK to making GREAT FILMS... i HOPE ! ! !

If the 7th movie sucks like this one did, They better stop making movies, and start doing a TV SHOW, with all of these Actors. 'THAT' would be the way to go.",1390176000,,1035,4.364583333333333

5988755,2,B00FF9SKSK,"abit turned off in the beginning by the name on one of the lead's planes. like the actors, they do a good job, not a big fan of the franchise probably because the stunts are so over-the-top unbelievable; no way people could drive like the characters do and survive. kinda tired of women characters called b*tches in films, including this story: a real turnoff as I'm female. just don't like the misogynistic vibe I get, including the scantily clad bevy of beauties. this is a franchise for the  guy's and no amount of making Dom family oriented takes away the ""women as playthings"" feel. missed the two Hispanic characters from Fast 5 who brought alot of comedy to that film. This one definitely needed more comedy. The producers had the two African-Americans squabbling like in Fast 5, but the two missing characters from Fast 5 were very funny and were missed here. And I think they made a mistake killing off the 2 characters they did: those two characters had an interesting love story, the most interesting love story in the franchise in my opinion. dialogue subpar in places. film doesn't totally suck but unless you're a huge fan of the series or have a high tolerance for patently unbelievable stunts, you may not enjoy it. 2 and a half stars.",1390089600,,1251,4.660633484162896

5988758,5,B00FF9SKSK,"The only issue I have is when this all began it was mostly live action car chases and stunts, and with this movie the CG and effects are getting a little Sci-Fi-ish.  To me added embellishment demeans the storyline, and they should stick more to raw action, chases, and stunts. Otherwise, THIS MOVIE STILL ROCKS! A truly engrossing story, loose ends tied up, and more loose ends created to keep the story going to 7.",1390003200,,416,4.546666666666667

5988786,1,B00FF9SKSK,"The Blu-ray disc won't play. I see the Universal Logo and then the screen just goes black. I just got a replacement disc from Amazon and neither the original disc nor the replacement will play.

I have 21 different Blu-ray movies, and this is the only one that experiences the problem.

From checking the one-star reviews, I see that one other reviewer experienced the exact same problem. I don't know which Blu-ray player he owns.

The DVD doesn't experience any playback problems, just the Blu-ray disc. For the record, I live in the U.S. and both my Blu-ray disc and my Blu-ray player were purchased in the U.S., so there's no region incompatibility issue.

UPDATE: I did an Internet search to see if other people experienced the same problem. I came across a forum of numerous PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 owners who were experiencing the exact same problem in December of 2013. Their solution was to disconnect from the Internet. As soon as I disconnected my Blu-ray player from the Internet, the movie was able to play. I am going to maintain my 1-star review because disconnecting from the Internet to watch the movie, and then reconnecting and re-entering my Wi-Fi password after the movie is over is an unreasonable burden. My other option is to shut off my router and disconnect my entire home from the Internet when watching the movie on Blu-ray.",1389830400,3,1614,5.371541501976284

5988813,5,B00FF9SKSK,It's a real shame Paul Walker is gone.  This movie franchise is amazing and this movie is no exception!  I loved this right up there with 2 Fast 2 Furious and the Fast 5.

5988823,4,B00FF9SKSK,"This movie has fast cars and lots of action.  I like action as much as the next person, but honestly some of these scenes in this movie are so far fetched that they approach ridiculous.",1389657600,,185,4.285714285714286

5988829,5,B00FF9SKSK,"This was a gift for my brother (and myself also).  I skipped this one in theaters.  Watching it at home made me realize that I probably should have watched in on the big screen.  Let's not kid ourselves.  We all know and the filmmakers know what type of film this is.  It isn't taking itself too seriously and that's how anyone should view it.  The series is all about action, hot women and very fast cars.  Don't critique the storyline or acting.  Love this movie for what it is because it does ""it"" (action, explosions, car chases, etc.) well.",1389657600,,545,4.434343434343434

That being said, they are one of my biggest guilty pleasures.  They're just pure, unadulterated fun.  Fast cars, manic action, great camaraderie and jokes between the characters -- if you go to the movies to be entertained, these fit the bill.  As always, some of the stunts and sequences stretch the limits of your imagination -- for instance, the runway scene at the end of this movie must have taken place on a runway roughly 20 miles long.  But, who cares?!  A strong addition to the F&F canon.",1389657600,,629,4.5625
5988833,4,B00FF9SKSK,Much the same as the other fast and furious movies.  Because of Paul Walkers death we decided to watch the movie.  People jumping off of moving vehicle at 90mph and surviving was unrealistic...but it was a good action flick.,1389657600,,224,4.717948717948718

And lets not forget, Vin Diesel's indestructible lower back which can take a 120 mph win shield impact when ejected from a car on the other side of the bridge....Ok. Aside from that the director seems to keep you on your toe's with your gut clenched jumping up like a teenager when the good guys start kicking major butt. The cast works out great aside from the occasional corny scenarios, and lets not forget ""The Rock"". He looks like Grampa Rock now but hes still huge as a grizzly and bends a couple people into pretzels. Overall its a well laid out action packed movie with good effects and a decent storyline.",1389657600,,695,4.523809523809524

5988855,3,B00FF9SKSK,"After loving every minute of Fast & Furious 5 I expected that this movie would exceed 5.  How disappointed I was when I discovered this movie was full of the dumbest dialogue and one-liners, a weak story, and ridiculously implausible scenarios.  There was plenty of fun action to be had throughout the movie, but there was so much stupidity that I was left annoyed I had given up my time.

One of the dumbest scenes is the final fight on the plane where it cannot take off because of too much weight but it continues on the infinite runway for a 20 minute battle only to finally come to an exploding halt right before the runway ends.  Or how about the NATO officers just allowing the dumb crew to let off an international criminal simply because they held a gun to their heads...SERIOUSLY!?! - The entire NATO base is loaded with armed guards and they are just going to walk off with the biggest criminal in the world!?!

I was glad I only spent $1.50 at Redbox for this movie because it definitely doesn't deserve full price for ownership.

5988862,5,B00FF9SKSK,one element that keeps this franchise going is the diversity of characters. I like how they expand it from LA to all over the world and end it coming back to LA. The action gets bigger and crazier with each installments and you need that to keep a old franchise like this going. Look forward to seeing fast 7 in 2015,1389484800,,316,4.19672131147541

5988886,4,B00FF9SKSK,"In F&F 6, Hobbs has Dom and Brian reassemble their crew in order to take down a mastermind who commands an organization of mercenary drivers across 12 countries. in return for full pardons for them all.

F&F 6 continues the mantra of if it isn't broke then don't fix it and reunites the original crew and combines that with high-octane action and terrific action stunts along with some humor that the series is known for.  As a pure action movie this has it all, even if the stunts are a bit out there in realism.  How long is that run way anyways? ;-)

The movie is fun and action packed although I think a bit long at 2 hours and 10 minutes and if you are a fan of the series then you will love this as this has all of what you liked about the other F&F movies and turns it up to a higher level. To me this series is at its best with all the original crew.  RIP P Walker, I don't think this series will be the same without you.",1389398400,2,929,4.0271739130434785

Having a 1997 turbo Supra which was pretty much the star of the show, and the fact that they used mostly Japanese cars was a great movie to watch. The next ones had slim plots and were just not as good as the first one. Still, if you don't mind a slim plot but love cars and lots of action, much of it unbelievable, then sit back and enjoy the show.

There is no way that could happen!""  We enjoyed the twists and turns in the story line and it kept us guessing until the end.

5989051,5,B00FF9SKSK,I was waiting for this movie for quite some time. I pre-ordered this movie and I couldn't wait until they released it. I have the whole trilogy It is one of my favorite trilogy movies. I'm looking forward to more movies of the trilogy. I was really upset to hear of Paul Walker's death. I don't know how there going to be able to replace him. Each of the movies they make of the trilogy gets better.,1388966400,,399,4.194805194805195
5989052,5,B00FF9SKSK,"I bought this movie along with the F&F 1-5 set while it was on sale to have my collection complete (until F&F7 at least). I bought this one with the Steelbook case and it is easily the best case of the 6 movies. The artwork is also much better than the bland, bargain-bin covers of the first set of 5.

One of my favorite things they worked into this Blu-ray is the homage to Paul Walker (Brian O'Connor) right after the Universal Studios segment when you first put in the disc. It follows him briefly through each of the five movies he was in (he was not in Tokyo Drift) and gives him a heartfelt goodbye. RIP, Paul Walker.

The movie itself is your pretty typical action movie, which for me isn't a negative. So you should expect exciting action scenes, fire, explosions, high speeds, fist fighting, and a ridiculous storyline with lots of plot holes. But if you know what to expect going in, you shouldn't have a hard time enjoying it! Very few, if any, of the movies are believable (the first one is probably the least ridiculous, story-wise), but they still lay out an interesting story and plenty of action/racing scenes. Works for me!

I won't spoil anything, but there is an especially ridiculous airplane scene in this one, that is really cool, but easily one of the most ridiculous 15 minute segments I've ever seen (short of them stealing the vault in Rio from Fast Five). But you get to watch Toretto (Vin Diesel) fight Hobbs (Johnson) along with some other unknown beefcake guy. Hard not to enjoy some of these crazy fights and racing scenes.

The movie ties in with F&F: Tokyo Drift at the end (since F&F: TD is the latest one in the F&F timeline), and introduces a new character to headline as the ""bad guy"" in F&F 7... Jason Freakin' Statham. So it really gets you excited for the next movie, though due to Paul Walker's untimely passing, leaves us unsure of how that will affect production and overall progression of the F&F timeline. I really hope they do a competent job re-engineering F&F 7 to properly pay respect to Paul Walker and his Brian O'Connor character.",1388966400,,2083,4.546666666666667
5989053,4,B00FF9SKSK,Good to watch but too much action! Some parts were too fictional and I wasn't used to watching it like that. Looking forward to the seventh one but I cannot believe Paul Walker will no longer be a part.,1388966400,,202,4.205128205128205

5989087,5,B00FF9SKSK,"The Fast & Furious team has done it again: made another follow-up that is almost as good as the one before it. F&F6 pulls off the difficult feat of adding to the story of the Turruto clan, while keeping intact the basics of the entire Fast & Furious series: the importance of family, the technical and physical skill of the members, and the repudiation of overbearing government authority. It is like the best graphic novel you ever saw. The effects are stupendous, and symbolic, so that even though at times they are literally impossible, they amaze, amuse, and move you emotionally. With the sudden death of Paul Walker, the series ends with the next F&F (I believe they had enough footage to complete it). And in the teaser for F&F7, seen as usual after the final credits of this film, Jason Statham doesn't seem convincing as a villian and nemesis of the Turrutos. But, who knows? The filmmakers have now pulled off the magic trick of making 5 thoroughly great sequels (and in order of greatness would be 4, then 5, then 6, then 2, then 3). Can they do it one last time? After watching this movie, I'm hoping they can.",1388793600,,1122,4.5594059405940595

I would say he was a good actor but a great human being. I hope the sales of this extended edition really do help his charity and it brings happiness to many more.

For those buying in Europe, the one I bought works on my PS3 as the blu ray feature is multi region, but be warned, the DVD is region 1 or region A meaning unless you have a multi region player, it might not work on a basic player.

There is also a lovely tribute to Paul Walker before the blu ray gets to the menu etc. All in all, I am very pleased with the product. May Paul Walker rest in peace and his family find some peace.",1388707200,,719,3.8843537414965987

Then the previews show an actor in fast 7 which I detest, I feel like it is just going on too long and getting too cheesy at this point. The story line is getting overextended.

5989244,5,B00FF9SKSK,"The death of Paul Walker has overshadowed (and rightly so) the release of F&F 6.  While the loss of such a poignant actor will be felt by his family, his friends, his co-workers, and his fans; he leaves behind a body of work that showcases an individual that lived each day to its fullest.

Fast and Furious 6 literally seems to open with the ending given to F&F 5 (with Brian and Dom in a race), it's only at the end of the race that we see the race is not just a competition to see who can get from A to B fastest, but it is to get to Mia as she is going into labor to give birth to Jack O'Conner.  The rest of the team is assembled after Agent Luke Hobbs pays a visit to Dom to seek his help in rounding up a team that has been stealing military grade components, a team that has as its member the thought-to-be-dead Letty Ortiz (as teased at the conclusion of F&F 5).

Without giving away the details of the film, I can say that all the components you would expect from a Fast and Furious franchise follow (amazing cars, terrific races, spectacular stunts, and well composed fight sequences).  Those that have been watching these films since The Fast and The Furious (not to be confused with 2009's Fast and Furious) will enjoy the payoff at the end of this film (not the teaser at the end of the film, but where the movie ends up).

Looking forward to F&F 7 in 2015!",1388275200,,1371,4.174242424242424

5989270,2,B00FF9SKSK,RIP Paul Walker... This movie was pretty lame compared to all the others. I've been watching this movie sine the first one and this one was by far my least favorite... Obviously after Tokyo Drift,1388275200,,195,4.6

5989275,5,B00FF9SKSK,"I've had it! Time after time, I click to watch a movie in HD. The movie starts out in HD, with 4 power lines. BUT! around half way through, the picture gets extremely bad, then when I check, there is only 1 power line. If I pay for HD, I want HD all through the picture! I want to read the credits, but I can't, because the picture is so bad! And let's not even talk about those 'Prime' videos. The picture quality is also terrible half way through, that I can't read the credits! And what about the statement, '1000's of movies'. Yeah right! 99.99 percent of those movies I don't want to look at, because they are either, unknown, useless, not to mention ridiculous, or just plain bad! There are only a handful of movies worth watching. The rest, forget about it.
Then you always send me a, 'rate this, rate that', if I rated every movie I've watched, after being scammed out of my HD choice, every movie would have a 'bad' rating. Which is what I should do. But I won't because it's not the movie's fault, it's AMAZON'S fault!
FYI, F&F 6 get's a great rating from me. The action is fantastic. Lin is a great director. Everybody held up their parts. However, its sad to watch Paul Walker, knowing he's gone.",1388188800,,1208,4.325991189427313

  kudos to the production company for the memorial that was included.  the movie was very good and tied up some loose ends that have been circulating for months.  we happen to miss the release in the theaters, but on our large screen, the action was as good if not better than all of the others in the series.  we all know the bad guys get it in the end, but the way it goes about the result is very creative and exciting.  as avid fans of the series, we cannot wait for the next one, super fast delivery service...",1388016000,,522,4.17
5989352,4,B00FF9SKSK,Soundtrack was excellent and the surround effects gave the receiver a workout.  Action was nonstop.

5989353,2,B00FF9SKSK,Unless you like incessant car chases this is not the movie for you. I found myself bored with the never ending car chase scenes.,1388016000,,128,4.375
5989354,4,B00FF9SKSK,"There may be spoilers.

Well the whole gang is back including director Justin Lin.  Is it possible to be even crazier and death defying than the earlier episodes.  Well, hell yeah.  Toss out any reality and the laws of physics and just watch the hot cars and fast chicks keep you entertained for a couple hours plus (could have done without the plus).

Dwayne Johnson returns as Federal Agent Hobbs.  He and his beautiful bad-ass deputy (Gina Carano) recruit his old nemesis, Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) to help him with the latest master criminal.  Dom is now a wealthy man living in Rio de Janeiro as is his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) who is now married to Brian (the late Paul Walker).  The rest of the gang is busy flying around the world and spending a lot of money.

Dom, of course, turns down the request.  That is until Hobbs shows him pictures of his former girlfriend Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) who was believed to have died in an earlier movie.  She is evidently now one of the bad guys.  Dom and his crew reunite and with the help of Hobbs who seems to have an unending supply of money and worldwide influence, establish their plan to take down the evil Shaw (Luke Evans) who is seeking possession of some microchip or something that will allow him to inflict destruction on the world.

The plan involves everybody in the crew (Tyrese Gibson, Sung Kang, Gal Gadot, and Ludacris) to drive their own hot car.  Lin, his writers and stunt men don't stop with just cars however.  Toss in a tank and a giant Russian cargo plane and now you've got something.  A couple hand-to-hand combat encounters with Carano and Rodriguez are also fun to watch.

Followers of the franchise should also pick up on the fact that this film is actually a prequel of sorts to ""Tokyo Drift,"" the 3rd film in the series.  In the end, I was left with just one question.  Will Gal Gadot get away with her Israeli accent as Wonder Woman in the upcoming Batman vs. Superman film?

This is an excellent Blu ray transfer.  It is the to-be-expected 1080p and has a 2.35:1 aspect ratio.  Subtitles include Spanish, French and English SDH.  The screen pops with excellent color, especially during some of the ocean shots.  Colors are warm otherwise and very accurate.  Skin tones are natural.  Blacks are deep dark.  Contrast and detail are excellent.  Some scenes don't appear to be a sharp as others but I suspect this was the same in the theatrical release.  No big deal.  This is a winner visually.

The audio includes a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, and it too is a stunner.  Dialog is perfectly transmitted.  Clear and concise.  With an action movie like this, you should expect some activity in the surrounds and subs.  You won't be disappointed.  Plenty of crisscrossing which is all perfectly natural.  Big bomb booms and some cool engine noises are helped by your sub(s) if you've got them.  Here are the extras:

*Unrated Extended Cut: The Blu-ray edition of Fast & Furious 6 includes two versions of the film: a 131- minute extended cut and a 130-minute theatrical cut. There's no difference that I could see.
*Audio Commentary: Justin Lin
*Take Control (HD, 19 minutes)
*The Making of Fast & Furious 6 (HD, 27 minutes)
*Planes, Tanks and Automobiles (HD, 24 minutes)

5989365,5,B00FF9SKSK,"Just finished watching the movie. Everything in this movie was seriously flat-out action-packed. I really loved it. The speed, the story, the cars, the teamwork, the guns, the fights, the twists and turns-- I'm baffled by all of the stunts pulled off and everything.. They did a good job with this movie.. Everything was really realistic and mind-blowing.. A+ grade movie, no doubt, in my opinion.

I highly recommend this movie if you are into Fast and Furious series, action movies, and if you are really into cars. Great, great movie with amazing plots. I can't wait to see the next movie.... but Paul Walker.. man, how it came at such a sad, random time for him to go so suddenly.. Still had a lot of live for and was still doing Fast and Furious 7 with the crew halfway done... Rest In Peace, Paul Walker.. One of coolest actors on our planet. You will be greatly missed man.. A lot of people idolized you, including myself.

Anyway you're in for a hell of a ride guys once you begin watching this movie. Enjoy it guys! Ride or die! Wooo!!",1388016000,,1044,4.489473684210527

5989425,5,B00FF9SKSK,"Some may say its to far away from reality, but its an action movie.
Its not supposed to be factual, or overly intellectual. Its for entertainment.
Some of the lines might be cheesy as anything, but the heart of the story is good, especially if you have followed the whole series.
The stunts are incredible, the acting better for some then others, we aren't expecting Oscar performances here, but still a good watch.
Loved the excitement of the whole thing! All you need is an open mind.
Car lovers will appreciate it even more.

Love to Paul Walker",1387756800,,372,4.552238805970149

5989441,4,B00FF9SKSK,"Very entertaining movie with an interesting plot, characters and of course cars.
However I felt the care race scenes lacked realism.... if you watch fast 5 and this movie back to back you can see that the car scenes are *fantastic* in Fast 5 but less so in this one. (Maybe a bit too much digital in this one). But then - I think any movie would be hard pressed to live up to the car scenes in Fast 5).
So great flick - but I'm docking 1 star because of this...

Paul Walker was one of my favorite actors - Fast and Furious, 2 Fast 2Furious ,Fast 5 and Running Scared being among my all time favorite movies.... he left us way too soon.",1387670400,,636,4.088

If there was a story line it was lost on me.  I'm sorry I had to pay for it. I shut it off 1/3 way through.",1387584000,2,381,4.094594594594595

However, UPS, as large and profitable as they are, could not get me the package and I'm suburban. Amazon does not know anything other than the volume during the holidays is more than normal. Really? And that's new? I'd have never known.

Two multi-billion dollar companies cannot get their junk in a row?

I will not see FF 6 until Monday maybe. Jeff Bezos needs to quit talking about sending packages by drone and instead buy up UPS or create his own delivery service and compete with the a-holes at UPS.

5989493,2,B00FF9SKSK,Great action scenes but the acting was horrible. The plot line wasn't much better. It appeared to be a way to introduce  Michelle Rodriguez back into the franchise. I have found a few of these movies to be good but #6 was a waste of money.,1387497600,,239,4.195652173913044
5989494,5,B00FF9SKSK,It's cool how they honor Paul in the movie showing all the cool clips! If you're a fast & furious fan this should be in your collection. The steel packaging is neat too! Super good movie and extended version adds on a few good scenes :) You get to see a preview of Fast 7 too!,1387497600,,276,3.9464285714285716
5989505,4,B00FF9SKSK,"It is exactly what you expect.  Fast cars, impossible vehicle stunts and one very welcome addition,  a girl fight! I did like how they were able to bring back one character and explain where she has been all this time.",1387497600,,218,4.425
5989506,5,B00FF9SKSK,"Fast 6 has all the hallmarks of the prior movies. Tons of action, great car sequences whether they are races or chases along with some totally absurd over the top moments. This time involving a plane and a tank. Basically everything you have come to expect as a fan of the franchise.

The main story in this one is the return of Letty. We see that she did not die, and learn what happened to her. However there is a pretty big twist with her return that plays throughout the movie. The cast is even more ensemble this time, where every character got screen time, but some were focused on far less. Jordana Brewster for example was not in the movie much at all until the end, and even Paul Walker's role was reduced somewhat. The Rock had an even larger role, along with the series first true arch enemy, Shaw played wonderfully by Luke Evans.

The other new addition to the cast was Gina Carano. I actually think the role was very well suited for her, in that it was written for her to be quiet and tough, which seems to suit her real life personality, and she did not have to carry the movie like she did with Haywire. I do think her acting ability has become better, but there is still definitely an element of be pretty and have a couple fight scenes. And she does have a couple very kick ass fight scenes with Michelle Rodriguez.

The movie really does a good job tying in elements and characters from the other films. It also finally shows where in the sequence the events of Tokyo drift appear (although you have to wait til the end credits to see that all play out). It also continues the theme of family and honor that have really become the backbone of the story even though it sometimes gets buried by the action sequences.

As far as extras go, there are a ton. There is a short intro to the next movie, which is actually a bit ominous given what happened to Paul Walker in real life. Obviously with his untimely death some of the set up to fast 7 may no longer apply. There are also a lot of deleted scenes, behind the scenes and making of material. So if you are one who likes to go through that stuff then you will be quite happy.",1387497600,,2144,4.273399014778325

5989607,4,B00FF9SKSK,"I love cars and the FF series is one of my favorites.  A co-worker and I quote these movies on a daily basis at work....they have become a part of our lives.  I'm still in shock over Paul Walker's death to be honest....it almost doesn't seem real.  It was just so sudden and obviously unexpected.  He was obviously huge into cars but the irony of his passing still makes it seem very surreal.  It would be like Stallone dying in a boxing ring.

I missed out on seeing this in theater, but I still bought it on the release date.  Very good addition to the FF series, but I don't think I'll watch it as much as 1, 4, or 5.  It had the least amount to do with car culture...and honestly felt more like a Mission Impossible movies at times.  Still, it has some cool chase scenes and great chemistry between the cast members as usual.

The whole ""family"" vibe of these movies is just as important as the cars!  Paul Walker will definitely be missed...I really think they should end the series with part 7 personally.  Rest in peace Paul....you will certainly be a legend in a lot of people's eyes!!!",1387324800,2,1094,4.334975369458128

There are SEVERAL things that you can question about physics, gravity & distance but who watches an action movie for it to be realistic?  It's all about the action & the characters that you've come to love.  This packs all that into the movie and even brings in an old villian.  If you like the Fast movie franchise you'll love this.",1387324800,,428,4.2875

The only good parts of this movie are the car stunts. The plot is ludicrous to say the least but if you can ignore that and are a fan of the stars, then you might like this movie. I thought that any movie with Walker, Diesel and the Rock, had to be good. Their acting was tight and strained, they did the best they could with the ridiculous lines they were given. If you are not a fan of this series then you might want to skip this movie. If you liked the previous then you will really like this one.",1387152000,,641,3.9384615384615387

5989731,2,B00FF9SKSK,"This film requires a suspension of belief beyond even fantasy fare.  I did not expect so silly a story to be pawned off on viewers of a current period action film solely for the purpose of demonstrating action.  I viewed this film on a whim because of the tragic death of one of its stars and all of the press surrounding the popularity of the film series.  I thought that there might be something I might have missed by choosing not to watch any of these franchise films beyond the first one and I am now glad I did not view films two through five.  Obviously there has been an enthusiastic audience for this film series but the entertainment value of such nonsense escapes me.  Yes, there is plenty of action, but if the only value of the film can be derived from its action sequences, why bother to try to incorporate a story to take up time between the action sequences.  I was sorry to learn of the death of one of its stars and realize that I mistakenly viewed this film with expectations that were unjustified.  I suppose fans of this franchise truly enjoy this type of ""entertainment"", but if one is expecting more than an exhibition of stunt doubles you may be disappointed.",1387065600,2,1183,4.449074074074074

this movie doesn't disappoint (also, Gina Carano kicked major ass as Riley). The way they tied it into Tokyo Drift was masterful, especially with who they introduced (of course I won't spoil it for you).

The story line was great, the actors were amazing, and the scene after the credits was such a cliff hanger (no spoilers, but make sure you watch till those scenes). I was sitting on the edge of my seat the entire time. I also have to say my god, does the rock look massive in this movie or what??? He looks like the incredible hulk without makeup on!

Like many others I found myself reflecting on Paul Walker's death during the movie. While there are a lot of opinions about his death, it was sad to think we will not see him in future films. He looked like such a happy person, and the cast and crew had amazing chemistry. Filling that void will be a major challenge for the cast and crew going forward, but I'm hopeful they can over come the loss.

The worst part of this movie is the dialogue.  Who writes this bland tripe?  The way they tie things up between Leddy and the Brazilian love interest in the end is so silly-dumb, I laughed.  We wish it was that easy.  The writing in general is pretty poor.  Only the action scenes are unique and titillating.

The actors truly do a stellar job, considering the writing.  They have nothing interesting to say, but deliver it as if it is meaningful.  It's sad to see excellent actors underused.

The plot is a dumbed-down heist/chase with a twist.  Nothing great.

But the action, effects, technology, and actors make this a high octane circus worth enjoying.

Tangent: I have to say, this movie proves that the upcoming Wonder Woman character in Batman vs. Superman has been miscast.  Big time.

5989842,1,B00FF9SKSK,"Just so you know, his real name is Mark Sinclair. He took the last name of his step-father (Vincent) to use as his first name and his last name from (I can only speculate here) either a pair of jeans or a locomotive, and came up with the very catchy name Vin Diesel. That's cool; one can find thousands of actors who have done the same. As long as the primarily prepubescent audience he has, studios will continue to make sequels to ""Fast and Furious"" (remember, they have to keep it PG13 to pack in the children). I naively thought proceeding with the series after Paul Walker died was incredibly disrespectful. It showed the gutless studio's real colors: GREED. Also, all of the actors should have walked out; and, never made/make another film in this series, which has already become comical (I mean, is there going to be a ""Fast and Furious 15?) THIS is the polar opposite of what Colin Farrell, Johnny Depp and Jude Law did when they came to the aid of their good friend Heath Ledger and director Terry Gilliam (all of whom are brilliant) when Ledger died whilst filming ""The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus"". They helped Gilliam (who completely transformed the screenplay) so Farrell, Depp and Law could complete the film. The reason I mention this is because ALL 3 ACTORS DONATED THEIR ENTIRE SALARIES TO Ledger's daughter so her economic future would be secure. This is called 'INTEGRITY""; something the studio(s) that made ""Fast and Furious"" lack in copious amounts. Co-actors as well.",1386892800,6,1494,4.772200772200772

5989844,5,B00FF9SKSK,"Fast and Furious 6 is my favorite film in this franchise thus far.  I will say I enjoyed it even more than Fast Five.  It is amazing to see where this franchise has gone throughout the years.  This franchise went from films about street racing to straight-up action and adventure films, starting with Fast Five.  Some people might not care for the change but I, personally welcome it.  This film continues in that direction and I found it to be the most entertaining.  There is nothing deep about this film.  This film will not win any awards but it is not supposed to.  This film, as well as the other Fast and Furious films, is meant to entertain, and I think it definitely succeeded.

The cast from the previous films all reprise their roles here.  The characters are all still enjoyable and play off each other very well.  I love the banter between the characters.  I thought this film had some of the best comedy of the series.

Unlike the previous films, this film feels more like Vin Diesels movie.  In the first two films Brian OConnor (Paul Walker) was definitely the main protagonist.  In Fast and Furious and Fast Five I felt Paul Walker and Vin Diesel were dual protagonists.  Here Toretto feels more like the main protagonist.  I do not mind this because of the plot of this film and because I like Toretto better than Brian anyway.  I especially like his scenes with Letty.  Brian is still important though, and goes through his own arc as well.

Letty, played by Michelle Rodriguez, is back in this film.  The way they explain how she survived in Fast and Furious, I thought was lame and implausible.  However, she does have more to do in this film.  In the first film she was one of the side cast and did not do much.  In Fast and Furious she was only in the opening.  However, in this she is given more screen time, more to do, and a pretty decent in the middle and end of the film.  The scenes she shares with Toretto I liked as well.

The villain Shaw I really like in this film.  This is probably because he has so little competition.  The Fast franchises main problem was its villains.  The villains have always been weak and uninteresting.  Shaw, I think is a big step up.  I like that they make Shaw the antithesis of Toretto and his code.  The incorporation of Letty makes this a very personal story for Toretto like Fast and Furious, which I like.

The action is very loud, fun, and intense like in Fast Five.  The effects are great too.  There is CGI, but I think it is used effectively.  Like in the last film, this film puts more emphasis on action and gun fights rather than racing.  However, there are still one or two races that are incorporated, which I found to be enjoyable.  Since my theater only shows movies in 2D, I cannot comment on the 3D aspect of the film.

Overall, this was a great time at the movies.  If you are a fan of the Fast Franchise, definitely check this one out.  The ending scene during the credits was also amazing.  I am definitely looking forward to the seventh installment.",1386806400,,3033,4.418478260869565

5989859,5,B00FF9SKSK,"Mixed emotions his the viewer seeing FAST AND FURIOUS 6 for the first time knowing that Paul Walker is gone and wondering what will happen with the in process Fast and Furious 7. But in ways that fact makes this movie more treasured. It is a whoop-`em up fast action packed film that takes your breath away with the wild car chases and one the ground derring-do. Writer Chris Morgan and director Justin Lin have this medium down to a predictable but fine science.

The plot is fairly simple (as usual) allowing the telling of the story to be more important than any big philosophical notions. Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson, with even larger biceps varices!) has Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) reassemble their crew (Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, Sung Kang) in order to take down mastermind Shaw (Luke Evans) who commands an organization of mercenary drivers across 12 countries. Payment? Full pardons for them all. The big driver is to `rescue' Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), who seems to be with Shaw's group after suffering amnesia, back into their fold. Wild situations abound and they are as exciting as ever - if not more so!
Definitely worth watching even for those who are not long term F & F fans. It is a terrific action film with sparkling actors having a great time. Grady Harp December 13",1386806400,2,1333,4.820960698689956

5989887,5,B00FF9SKSK,"There is no reason to hesitate in buying this movie. Its so far the most action pack of the franchise and yet the Director, Justin Lin, manages to give enough room to most beloved characters to have at least one epic moment to impress us.

What made me love the franchise was the time spent building and straining the relationships shared by the characters, and I really grew to not only love Brian (may Paul be thanked for his dedication to the role, making Brian so likeable, and rest in peace - he will be missed) and Dom (and honestly I cannot imagine anyone but Vin playing this character), but really I became eager to  get more of Mia and Letty, Tej and Roman, Hun and Gisele, yep the Rock too :-)

F6 is best enjoyed on a big screen with dim light, you can get drawn to the action, no matter how over the top it is at time, and really just rewind again and again to appreciate the surprises and tricks. Still, I give kudos to the editor for saving the slow moments, the shots of what domestic life was and became, because it truly anchor you in the situation, handing you the purpose of their actions and the sheer dedication the group has into succeeding.

Thanks to everyone involved in linking things so well between the movies and the characters, even though you can be entertained by this movie as a stand-alone, I suggest that you splurge and get yourself FF4 and FF5. You will have no regrets!

There are wonderfully cool scenes, often a surprise laugh will sneak on you, and there is sadness; for the character of Gisele and for real life actor Paul.
After re-watching all of the movies in the franchise in a row, I am eager to see the scenes P. W. filmed for FF7. The next installment will probably change in tone and vary wildly from the original intent but it became a dire need to see him one more time having fun with his on-screen family, making us smile and making us care.

In conclusion, buy F6 on its own merits, its fun, packed with incredible action scenes, and the actors (yes everyone last of them) are awesome, but most of all it is the perfect ending to the trilogy that the 4th, 5th and 6th movies created.",1386806400,,2139,4.36180904522613

I remember when this movie first came out and the backlash for this movie was at a all time high, people were saying it was stupid to keep the series going, its recycled, the actors suck, they should have never done this movie and this was still being said after the movie came out. When i saw this movie like the rest I have enjoyed them all and thought the story line went from OK to really good. Of course I have a passion for my car(2013 302 boss) and others so this movies has always been one of my favorites, they have always brought back the same actors most movies stop after 3 and if more are made its with some crappy actors, I am probably one of the few that enjoyed FF3 Tokyo Drift, so this review is coming from a real fan of the series. This movie will blow you away and keep you entertained from start to finish. I don't know what will happen with FF7 but I hope they finish it even though Paul walker died, im not saying a replacement needs to be found but if they do the movie based off of Tokyo Drift like at the end of FF6 then technically Paul's character was not apart of Drift only Dom.",1386547200,,1261,4.088709677419355
5989920,2,B00FF9SKSK,"""You wanna catch wolves, you need wolves."" After their heist made the gang all rich they have all settled in nicely to normal life but not in the US. When Hobbs (Johnson) needs a way to catch a criminal mastermind there is only one call he makes. Dom (Diesel) and Brian (Walker) get the crew together again but this time they are working with the law. This is a movie that doesn't really need much said about it to convince you to watch or not watch. Since it is the 6th in the series you have either kept up or not. That said...I have seen all of them and only really liked the 5th one because it was more of a heist movie then ""I have car, I go fast."" I know what your thinking...if you don't like it don't watch, on the other hand I can't really talk about it if I don't watch them. This one was, how do I put this...not good. The plot seemed OK, help catch the bad guy and you can go home. The problem is that this seemed to be that last thing on the movies mind. Five minutes after they agree to catch him they find him, and let him go. Then Dom and Hobbs meet him face to face, and let him go. The only way to catch this guy is only during long car chase after long car chase. The stunts and chases got more and more absurd to the point of being laughable. ***SPOILER*** Taking down a TANK with a smashed up Mustang to taking down a PLANE with a car that looked like a GEO Tracker on a runway that must have been 60 miles long. I mean seriously! ***SPOILER OVER*** There are also so many people jumping onto moving cars I lost count. I will again say I am not a fan of this series...and this movie is an example of why.

I love this series but in case you are unfamiliar with the movie here is a summary of it.

Fast & Furious 6 is a 2013 American action film that was written by Chris Morgan and directed by Justin Lin.  It is the sixth installment in the Fast and the Furious film series.  The film stars Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Chris Bridges, Sung Kang, Luke Evans,
Gina Carano and John Ortiz.  Fast & Furious 6 follows a professional criminal gang led by Dominic Toretto (Diesel) who have retired following their successful heist in Fast Five (2011), but remain wanted fugitives.
U.S. Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) agent Luke Hobbs (Johnson) offers to clear the group's criminal records and allow them to return home in exchange for helping him to take down a skilled mercenary organization led by Owen Shaw (Evans) and his second-in-command, Dominic's presumed-dead lover Letty Ortiz (Rodriguez).

Again this was a great action movie and this Steelbook and DVD are only $19.00.

The action scenes were excellent. The airplane/runway scene was a bit 'extended'. Many may say they tried to put more story into this one and that is true, but I believe they did so pretty well. It did seem to be over fairly quickly, but the teaser for the next one has me excited how it will go. If you liked any of the previous movies you really should see this one.

I watched this before the death of Paul Walker. From what I understand they had most of the scenes shot for the movie, so we will see how they end the show and if they keep the scene with Paul Walker at the graveyard.",1386374400,,756,4.04

5989990,5,B00FF9SKSK,"I have avoided this series since it originally began because I felt like it would be to macho and oversexed as I refuse to live a life as society tells me as a man to be. Of course a friend finally challenged me to the series so I bought the fast and the furious and enjoyed it so much that I ended up buying the first five movies as it's more about ""family"" as a team then anything else which drawn my attention completely. It was so different then what was out there and Paul Walker always shined from being a FBI Agent to a criminal as he fell in love with the street racing and his new family. I have not seen the sixth one as I wanted to wait until it came out on DVD but with the death of Paul Walker I honestly had to think quite a few times if I would end up watching and knowing he will never be with us again. I was devastated to learn the news and when a celebrity passes on I typically never watch their projects again as it only reminds me of their passing but after sometime thinking it would be best if I and the rest that knew or loved Paul that we continue to remember him through his life work of charity and politeness to his artistic acting abilities such as his fast and the furious projects. So I will watch this film and remember who Paul was as an actor and as a person. HIs talents will never be forgotten and it's fast and the furious that will keep him alive for me. I love you Paul Walker and never forget you!",1386115200,7,1438,4.013937282229965

**Added 12/8/2013**
I Finally got to watch this Amazon Digital. The Movie is Just As Entertaining as all the others. Its a Shame Paul (aka Brian) died in a way that he depicts himself in the Fast franchise but was a passenger along for a ride.

Movie Is Well Worth a watch. And remember it is entertainment.

Loved his work in Fast and Furious, Joy Ride, 8 Below, Pawn Shop Chronicles, Pleasantville, and especially Running Scared.  I just wish it was a bad dream, that i would wake up and it was just a big joke.  Unfortunately that is not going to happen.  I just wish you wouldn't have gotten in that Porsche with that dude who obviously didn't know what the heck he was doing.  Maybe it was a fluke accident, a blown tire?  a cat crossing the road?

5990027,5,B00FF9SKSK,"I'll be honest. 2011's Fast Five didn't quite grab me the way it did most critics and fans. Everyone was raving about how that seminal chapter in the Fast in Furious series had changed the game. The series was no longer a car fetish showcase, instead the fifth installment transformed Toretto and O'Conner's team of car enthusiasts into a full blown professional heist team. It was a fine film, sure, but it didn't quite blow me away like it did everyone else. Something was missing to me.

Enter Fast and Furious 6, or ""Furious 6"". This was, for all intents and purposes, intended to be the grand finale of the Fast franchise and it definitely shows as director Justin Lin goes all out in what is one of the biggest, loudest, and most fun action films I've seen in a long time.

Simply put, this film has it all. Awesome action set pieces, beautiful cinematography, cool cars, plot twists and turns, and most of all, lovable, memorable characters that you really care and root for. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are accompanied by a wonderful diverse cast who never lets you forget that what the Fast movies are really, truly about: family. Without this crucial ingredient this would be just another by-the-numbers action flick. Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, Jordana Brewster,Sung Kang - the entire cast of this film deserve the utmost accolades for truly bringing this story alive. The moments where this film shines the brightest are when the crew is together and acting as a unit- a family.

Its truly evident that director Justin Lin went for broke in this, Everything he has done with the Fast franchise has been leading up to this film. If this were the final installment it would be a damn fine way to go out, but alas this is Hollywood and the Fast films are gaining traction like never before, critically and commercially.

I have not seen the first 4 installments, but after seeing this one I am incredibly eager to delve into this story from the beginning. Next year brings us Fast 7 and if the the mid credits scene is any indication (yes, people, there is an AWESOME tease during the credits) then we are in for an absolute treat for the 7th chapter in the high octane story of Dom Toretto and Brian O' Conner.

But, until then, all roads do indeed lead to Six.",1385769600,2,2303,4.634803921568627
5990038,4,B00FF9SKSK,"It's hard to believe how entertaining and fun this franchise has become. To me FF6 is a little but of a guilty pleasure because a series revolving around a group of criminals who stop terrorists by driving cars shouldn't be this good. Honestly, if you tried explaining the plot to the movie to anyone who wasn't familiar with the series, they'd think you were ridiculous for enjoying it. It honestly seems like a soap opera or something, characters coming back from the dead and suffering from amnesia, traitorous friends, dying to save loved ones. It's all so stupid and silly, but it works here and FF6 does what every good sequel should do, it ups the ante and takes what its predecessor's done and kicks it up. FF6 isn't known for its great plots or dialogue, so what it focuses on improving on is bigger and more exciting set pieces. It does a great job of making each piece original and unique, and as a result the movie has 3 or 4 great action scenes and none of them feels like a retread. It's this freshness coupled with the movie's ability to not take itself too seriously that makes it truly entertaining. As a result of all this, I find myself excited to see what the upcoming sequel has in store and am even excited by the rumors that they plan on making parts 8 and 9 too. No series should be able to do this, and yet somehow the Fast and Furious franchise defies the odds much like the driving in the movies defies all sense of physics and gravity.",1385769600,,1463,4.402214022140221

This is just another chapter and its just as good as the rest. The best thing about these movies is that they haven't switched out any actors (which is the worse thing you can do to a sequel, yes?) and overall all the story lines blend into each other perfectly. Some of that action is a bit over the top, which is what you would expect in another Fast movie, also the ""family"" theme seems a little over done.

I have been a fan since jump and this was one of the better ones.  The ending is phenomonal, FYI, there will be a 7.  And the way the have tied this all in with the others is masterful.",1385337600,,473,4.258426966292135
5990079,5,B00FF9SKSK,"The genius of Fast 6 and it's predecessor, Fast 5, is that these are films that know what they are and how to deliver. In short, the plot is a testosterone drenched excuse for car chases to ensue with a rag tag group of racers who will never cease to remind you that they are 'family' and that's the most important thing. Unless you need to step up and help defeat an international terrorist.

The film is just pure entertainment. No big stories or moral lessons at the end. But a damn fine excuse for vehicular mayhem. It doesn't need to be anything more than that, and it knows it. However, it does try a bit, and I can't fault it for wanting just a bit more.

Fast Six is a lot of fun, if you have at all enjoyed the franchise I'm not speaking to you, if you haven't seen the previous films or are unsure, go in with the mindset that you're about to be taken on a thrill ride. Buckle up, try and have fun, and don't ask too many questions, and you're sure to have a blast.",1385337600,,975,4.099476439790576

5990084,2,B00FF9SKSK,"Fast and Furious. the movie series, has always been an adrenaline packed entertainment delight. This newest piece, Fast & Furious 6, was unfortunately the exception. I don't know whether other watchers can relate to this statement, but...here goes. Fast and Furious 6 has a tedious amount of action. So much action it's boring. That statement would be ""oxymoronic"" under other circumstances. Here? That's the only way I can describe it. So much is going on onscreen it's actually difficult to digest all the other ""stuff"" and follow the story line, supported in many instances with a single line or phrase. It's downright required this be a video one can rewind, simply to follow the story line. At first, I was only challenged by attempting to follow the newly-alive cast members, as I'd missed F&F 5. After I got over that little ripple, largely by ignoring it, I then had to follow Lettie's being newly-risen as well. There are so many alive-after-tragic-death characters in this F&F I just can't go there now. But, suffice it to say, that was boring as well. Now onto other things this film has. The action was unrelenting and unbelievable. Downright impossible. The other F&F movies had superb auto stunts. Absolutely sit-on-the-edge-of-your-seat, yell-at-the-screen, nail-biting stunts. This one? Absolute tripe. They're so unbelievable the story line flops in the process. Bottom line for this film, in my humblest opinion? Wait for it to be on cable. The $17.99 (yes! $17.99 with NO rental option!) was a total waste of money. I wish I hadn't bought it...wondering how terrific it was seems to have been a much better state of mind. I'm giving it 2 stars, only because the CG was pretty good, and makes up the greatest portion of the movie.",1385164800,4,1748,4.948979591836735

It took a left turn when they added rock, that's when it really went tooooo hollywood. Ok let me stop blablering about the series and get to this movie.

This one only had about 2 wow moments, the freaking 15 mile runway strip(not) with the car holding the plane down(blabla) and the tank on the road keeping up with fast muscle cars? ummmm yeah. See it's moments like that that make you go this isn't realistic they're just going for brownie points on trying to have those wow moments that everyone talks about. like how you're going to land inside another car once a tank flips over and throws you out.

Vin Diesel's acting chops rival that of a tapeworm. And can't he find another piece of clothing other than wife-beater tees? They were hip back in the 90's but faded out. He's rockin those things in every movie, still, 15 years later. Paul Walker seemed like he was going through the motions but I do think he has talent. I guess after 6 sequels that happens. The action was pretty eye-popping though, but otherwise this was the same old action film. I did laugh at some of the ridiculous parts, Vin flying through the air like a damn hawk over the highway. I'm surprised he didn't wink at the camera. This guy can go away now, perhaps study the craft of acting rather than stand there like a water bottle saying macho lines.

What is wrong with these bloody studios for them to release the title in the country where it was produce so late. I bought it from Amazon UK. It was region free too. Also I have to mention it cost me only $ 22.50 with shipping from uk. That was gala. I love the Fast And Furious line-up. But not so much the Two witout it's original cast. To date my favorite is ""Fast Five "".  It is only my opinion, to my self. Movie I gave it a 3.5 Stars as too much of night shooting and it did took a way the fun a bit.

5990102,3,B00FF9SKSK,"The sixth entry in the now long running franchise suffers from a few bad old action cliches and a few new ones too. It's almost like the series has turned into an Ocean's 11 type all-star ensemble cast event, each character bringing their own element be it comic relief (Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris) the tough guy (Vin Diesel, The Rock) or the 'good' guy (Paul Walker). Two parts action one part comedy and Dwayne Johnson, who will always be the wrestler to me, is still overplaying his role as the ultimate badass cop.

We get it, you're big, you've done steroids for a decade and you can bully and fake your way through a movie, good for you. The scene when you immediately realize this, is when Hobbs decides to 'question' a man in detainment, when he's done it looks like the Incredible Hulk has just had his way with the room. I don't think we've ever seen Vin Diesel in a humanistic role in this series or anywhere else for that matter.

Obviously this movie wasn't made to be realistic, but all the jumping off cars through the air and stuff is a little ridiculous if you ask me, I'm not watching a fantasy film, something has to be grounded in reality. What this movie has always been able to do well however, is set a mood. Ever since the first film they have known how to play the right songs, show the right girls and pick the right cars. And when you couple that, with some of the action sequences in the film it is a great stylized experience, though of course that does not make up for the lack of substance.",1379548800,4,1518,4.360424028268551

First was good also but I liked the second one better. Tokyo Drift was horrible. 4 was good and 5 was okay but not a lot of racing and not that good of a story line.

What kills me is the people that bash this movie keep crying how fake and unreal it is. Hello,it is a movie. I mean,did you watch the first one and actually watch the first one and thought that the scene that Van Disel did when he raced Brian to the railroad tracks and got hit by the train and his car flipped 1000 times and Van Disel walks away from it happens everyday?

I personally think the should have kept Lydia dead. I hate when they kill a character and bring them back 2 movies later. Kinda makes it look like they are desperate to keep the fan base. But overall,I think it was a great movie and the best one so far. And from the end of the movie gives indication,it is only going to get better(make sure you do not turn off the movie at the end if you have not seen it)",1378944000,2,1078,3.9178082191780823

Some may say the story of the sixth ""F&F"" franchise is not only incredible but silly, full of plot holes and absurd decision-making. During the action scenes, some of which contain stunts involving a tank and an airplane, cars flip and fly in the air in a most ridiculous way. This I had expected, having enjoyed the previous high-octane action ""Fast Five.""

And I enjoyed the action set-pieces in ""Fast & Furious 6,"" even though I felt the action scenes are cut too fast, and editing is sometimes confusing, especially during the highway scene. Also, the latest ""F&F"" ends with a slightly sad note, as some players reprise their characters for the last time here.

""Fast & Furious 6"" ends with a cameo appearance of a certain star in a brief Tokyo scene, a sort of teaser for the next ""Fast & Furious"" film that is scheduled to be released in 2014.",1374796800,,1185,4.580188679245283
5990128,3,B00FF9SKSK,"I really don't have anything bad to say about Fast and Furious 6 as an action movie.

It really stands up to the title, delivering an explosive, entertaining, fast-paced, furious action film, with fast cars, fast women, and fast guns. What more could you ask for in a Fast and Furious movie?

Every element that makes a successful action film is right here:
Tough guys. Tough girls. Muscle cars. Chases. Martial arts. Guns. Shootouts. A tank. Explosions. Humour. One-liners. Oh yeah, and the Rock, who is one of those actors, like Christopher Lee and Benedict Cumberbatch, that has been scientifically proven to make every film 33.33% better! I predicted this would be a box-office success right from the beginning. Right from the gate, Fast 6 shows it's true colors: a ludicrously fun, outrageously unrealistic, entertaining, boom-bang popcorn film. And as that, it delivers, ninety-nine-point-ninety-nine percent!

The set pieces are absolutely amazing. I am here to say on hand that the Tank Chase was one of the best chases/action scenes of 2013 so far! The airplane chase was absurd but entertaining (I loved Diesel's flying headbutt!), and the girlfight between Michelle Rodriguez and Gina Carano (A real MMA fighter) was well choreographed and pretty brutal.

As a film for the more demanding viewer, like me, it came up slightly flat. Shaw is played excellently by Luke Evans (Immortals, The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug!), but the character is never given any motive or meaning to his actions other than: This guy's bad, he wants to shut down America with a computer chip. You could argue that's all you need in an action film, but yeah, it was slightly underwhelming.

Gina Carano's ""twist"" added a neat, erm, twist (pun intended) on her and Michelle Rodriguez's next fight. But it also rendered completely moot and unfathomable all of her previous actions. Really, watch the film, and then watch it again watching what she does. It makes no sense.

But hey, really, who said Fast and Furious movies have to make sense? This is a movie where the Rock jumps 30 feet from an overpass onto a moving car. This is a movie where people treat cars more expensive than a small third-world country like bulldozers. This is a movie whose climax takes place on a runway some handy cinephiles and an engineer worked out to be 29 miles long. The world's longest runway? 5 miles. But the reason it works so well is that Fast and Furious 6, like it's predecessor Fast 5, embraces and even flaunts it's OTT attitude. The result? An entertaining film, but one where you must leave your brain at the door. Not even - leave it at the parking lot outside.

In conclusion, Fast and Furious is ludicrous, absurd, and silly. And it's also a riveting, very fun and entertaining action film that shows everything is going well under it's shiny chrome hood. This is an action engine in 5th gear!

Enough with the car metaphors already. 3.7 Stars! Recommended!

P.S. I would like to give a shout-out to Tauheed Epps and Cameron Thomaz, aka 2 Chainz and Wiz Khalifa for their completely awesome song We Own It, which features in the credits of this film! 5 Stars for that song, yeah!

P.P.S. The post-credit's scene has got to be the best 30 second action film I have ever seen. James Lin ends his film with a brutal twist leaving viewers yearning for a sequel. Or should I say, a sevenquel? The Fast and Furious franchise has proven to be one of the most enduring of all action franchises, and I wish it good luck in the future. But here's hoping we never have to see Faster and Furiouser and Furiouser 17:  Engine Trouble in Malibu.",1374796800,8,3615,4.749601275917065

5990130,5,B00FF9SKSK,"Furious 6, the sixth installment of the Fast and Furious franchise, does what The Lone Ranger refused to do: it creates heroes who unironically stand for the right thing, all the time. It also proves that a such a moral-driven movie can still be a lot of fun. Albeit by ditching reality for a ton of big action. The plot doesn't make a lot of sense. But there are a ton of cars.

For no real reason, Dominic and his friends have risen from small-time criminals to the sort of person that an ace DSS agent turns to for help in catching an international terrorist. He does so. They help him, in hopes of reconnected with Dom's long-time, presumed dead girlfriend and of getting full pardons for their considerable crimes. A ton of action scenes held together purely through character moments and a terrible plot ensues.

A plot point involving Paul Walker being sent to prison under a fake name, in order to get information from another criminal about Shaw, the guy they're after, makes very little sense, and serves no plot purpose. It's basically done in order to connect to the past films: Walker meets his buddy from the first film, and then is threatened by the villain from the fourth film.

Gina Carano still needs to learn how to act. She also served very little purpose, probably because the editors realized her acting was so bad that they needed to trim all her lines. She gets like a dozen in the whole film. It's sad, as she's possibly the best fighter in the entire film: her subway battle with Michelle Rodriguez was a highlight.

Plenty of humor came organically out of the film, both when it was trying to be funny and when it wasn't, but the situation was so fun and ridiculous that it became funny. But when the film tried to create it's own, purely humorous moments, it fell flat. There's a scene where Ludachris and the Rock humiliate a British guy who was rude to them by forcing him to take off his shirt and pants. It really wasn't funny.

The focus on family was a little strong: it was harped on every 20 minutes that they all stuck together because family never leaves anyone behind. Still, it's refreshing to see a film to blatantly sentimental. It works throughout the film: at the climax, I still felt that the stakes were high, despite all the past carnage, because the family was being threatened.

As long as you don't mind valuing fun, moderately moral adventure over logic, this is a fun film. They have a post-credits scene teasing a seventh, but it remains to be seen if they can actually top themselves with it.",1374451200,2,2547,4.550218340611353

There are more twists in this movie than the previous one. I did not see them coming. They make it more intriguing.

It was awesome seen Mia and Brian as parents to little Jake and us fans welcomed the new character with open arms.  However, there were things I didn't like in this movie was that Gal Gadot character (Gisele Yashar) died at the end and Vin Diesel left Elena Neves (Elsa Pataky) for Letty (Michelle Rodriguez).  I know that Letty and Dom have a history, but he was with Elena know, why did they have to bring back Letty?  I hope that on Fast and the Furious Elena come back and fights for Dom.

5990156,4,B00FF9SKSK,"Over the years since I first watched The Fast and the Furious way back in 2002 I've watched the franchise, actors and characters grow giving birth to one of the best action franchises ever, and along the way I've come to like and even care a little bit about the characters in the films and you would not think with the type of films that Fast and Furious 6 along with their predecessors are, which is astounding because well Vin Diesel and Paul Walker have managed to do it again, in that they have created yet another fun and entertaining film in the long running Fast and Furious franchise. It is truly remarkable in what Original Films and Universal Studios have done with this simple franchise that started back in 2001 with The Fast and the Furious. The Fast and the Furious was a relatively low budget film about street racing, good looking guys, gorgeous women and exceptional action with limited star power in its little known cast. You would not think The Fast and the Furious would be a break out hit grossing over one hundred and forty million domestically and over two hundred million worldwide, the film did. Original and Universal found an untapped niche in the urban crowd and Underground Street racing and brought it mainstream.

It is perhaps even more remarkable that it has had the longevity that the franchise has had lasting up to what are now six films and a seventh coming out next year. The Fast and Furious franchise has done what no other franchise has done outside of the horror genre or reboots. Most franchises die or get rebooted after the second or third film, and it did look like the Fast and Furious franchise was going to die after the disappointing 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003) and the bad The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006). Those two films were relatively entertaining, but did not have the same feel as the first film, and definitely not the same heart as The Fast and the Furious. How did the franchise manage to survive? Not by rebooting its self like so many film franchises do no, but instead reinventing its self and returning to its roots like the franchise did in 2009's Fast and Furious bringing back the original cast, creating a good yet simple story, returning to Los Angeles and of course revving up the action. Fast and Furious was a huge success revitalizing the franchise, and 2011's Fast Five took the franchise to a whole new level in the scope of the action along with bringing in the Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and grossing over six hundred million worldwide. Did the Fast franchise continue their remarkable film journey with another quality film with Fast and Furious 6? The answer is an unquestionably yes, but not without a few bumps along the road.

The film opens with Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) racing down a narrow mountain road on the Canary Islands. They arrive just in time for Brian and Dom's sister Mia Toretto's (Jordana Brewster) child to be born. Yes, racing and action are have a big importance in the franchise, but perhaps the biggest themes in the film are family and friendship, which plays out in all the films and plays an important role in the film. While Dom, Brian, Mia and Elena Neves (Elsa Pataky) welcome the newest member of their family Luke Hobbs (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) along with his new partner Riley (Gina Carano) arrive in Moscow, Russia after a military transport was hit by a professional crew using cars led by Owen Shaw (Luke Evans). Hobbs can think of only one team good enough to take down Shaw and his team. Hobbs finds Dom and manages to convince Dom to help him by showing him a picture of Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez). Letty of course was believed to have been killed back in Fast and Furious. This gets Dom to help Hobbs and brings his team back together to take down Shaw and bring Letty home.

The plot of Fast and Furious 6 is perhaps the franchises most complicated one and in that it is flawed. One of the biggest weaknesses in the plot is Gina Carano character Riley. I will not give anything away, but once you learn more about the character in the film the reasoning for her character being in the film does not make a whole lot of sense especially dealing with Letty. Then there is the Letty issue. She was supposedly killed off back in Fast and Furious, so did the writers manage to make her return believable and the answer is yes. First they had to answer how she was alive and then why was Letty with Shaw's crew. The writers did a believable job with showing how Letty survived the events of Fast and Furious, and did a decent job explaining how Letty ended up with Shaw's crew. Overall the writing done to bring back Letty was believable, but also a stretch. The other flaw in the film was dealing with Shaw and explaining what he was trying to achieve, which the script did not do a real good job explaining. Besides that the story is good mixing elements of humor, action and drama well. I do wish Universal and Justin Lin brought back Leo Tego and Omar Santos. The two were only minor characters, but I still enjoyed the two characters in the two previous films. In the film, there is also a major character death and a mention of things to come for Han Seoul-Oh (Sung Kang) and what transpires in Tokyo Drift, which takes place after this film, but I will not go into details for those of you who have not seen this film or Tokyo Drift.

All right enough about the story and let's get to what everyone truly comes to these films for is the racing, action and carnage that is the trademark of Fast and Furious films, and those fans will not be disappointed. The action in Fast and Furious 6 is thrilling and non-stop. There is a thrilling car chase scene on the streets of London, England with Shaw and his crew using what looks like armored Indi 500 cars that is extremely well done and orchestrated. Unbelievably there is a fabulous scene at an airport and cargo plane that is stunning. Then of course there is the scene with the tank, but I will not give more about that scene away. The Rock brought his muscled bound body and laid waste to his opponents in awesome fashion as usual. Everything was not perfect with the action. There is one scene during the middle of the film that was not well done, and really did not add up plot wise, and again it involved Riley and Letty, but that was my only real complaint with the otherwise great action in the film.

The remarkable journey of the Fast and Furious franchise will come to an end one day soon but until then enjoy the thrilling ride, which Fast and Furious 6 brings us with non-stop action, a pretty good script and decent action. While not on the same level as Fast and Furious or Fast Five, Fast and Furious 6 is only a slight step down. I highly recommend Fast and Furious 6 as 2013 has been lacking in good quality pure action films, which Fast 6 delivers and will go down as one of the best if not the best pure action films of the year, so do not miss the ride.",1370995200,4,6998,4.476898981989037

I have to update the Fast and Furious series rankings after seeing this film.  They are now:
1) The Fast and The Furious
2) Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift (I realize this is the one spot that is very controversial among us F&Faholics)
3) Fast & Furious 6 - by the slightest of margins over #4
4) Fast & Furious
5) Fast Five - Still an excellent Film
...
...
2nd to last) any other car racing or heist film, even if it does not include Vin Diesel or Han.
last) 2 fast 2 furious.

Now that we have gotten that out of the way, let's get to the meat and potatoes.  Vin Diesel appearing to be the same height as The Rock will make me laugh every time I see it.  Maybe in the F&F world I would be as tall as Yao Ming.  What is Diesel standing on, Tyrese's music career?  I would additionally like to know who takes the most PED's leading up to the filming.  I would probably put The Rock #1, but Luda is ripped too now, which really came out of left field.

Three other investigations I would like to see:
1) How long was the runway at the end of this film?  At what point did they cross over country lines?  Did they need to show passports?
2) Which was more awesome, when Dees (I hope he doesn't mind if I call him Dees) jumped to save Michelle Rodriguez falling off the tank  OR  When Dees drove the car through the nose of the plane?  Both were incredibly realistic.
3) Yeah right Letty is still alive.  Come on.  You expect me to believe that?  That is almost as plausible as Vin Diesel being as tall as The Rock.

In closing, the Fast and Furious series is wonderful as everyone knows.  Don't stop boys, keep up the good work.  This is all possible due to the incredibly talented actors (Save Paul Walker and Michelle Rodriguez... oops sorry).  That being said, there is one man who rises above the rest.  The most eloquent asian car racer/loveable criminal I know.  Han saved this series and is awesome in every possible way.  #teamhan

The first movie was kind of decent because it was down to Earth and tried to depict the street racing culture, etc. Somehow, over the next few movies, this street racing crew has somehow gotten into saving the world. Utterly ridiculous. The movie has become an insult to everyone's intelligence. This was one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. Absolutely no thought was put into the physics of the stunts. The nonsense started in the last one with the bank vault scene. It managed to get worse in this film. The masses are a little bit slow, but it will take another movie before they start to figure out that these movies aren't worth going to see anymore.

Funny thing is too, for a movie that prides itself on depicting street culture, it got London all wrong. Almost every English person in the movie is stuck-up or evil. You can count on one hand all the minorities that are shown in London. It's really sad that the crew didn't bother to interact with any of the East Indians, Africans, Caribbean people, Arabs, Bangladeshis and other ethnic people that greatly inhabit London now. I think they entered London with this impression that it was like Downton Abbey and just ran with it. What a missed opportunity.

5990176,5,B00FF9SKSK,"Just when I thought that out of all the films in this impressive franchise, none would top Fast Five, I was dead wrong. Fast & Furious 6 is completely worth your time, and absolutely worth the price of admission. SERIOUSLY. When this movie was over, I was left feeling excited, relieved, and blown away. Rarely do sequels improve and not miss a step, but I am glad to say Fast & Furious 6 does not miss a step or a left/right turn. Returning are Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, Michelle Rodriguez, Gal Cadot, Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, Elsa Pataky, Sung Kang, and Dwayne Johnson. They make these movies so much fun to watch that it is almost ridiculous. They all did an outstanding job in this movie, every actor was on point and Tyrese and Ludacris bring even more humor this time around. New additions include: Luke Evans as the primary bad guy Owen Shaw and Gina Carano as Riley. Now on to the story line.

Some may be ashamed to admit this because of the type of movie Fast 6 is, but there are lessons and values to be learned and appreciated in this movie. Family is important and Family comes first. That is the key lesson in this movie. And Fast 6 succeeds in getting this point across. Another thing I want to point out, yes there are a few emotional moments in the movie. And finally, If you did not get anything else out of this review, know this: Fast & Furious 6 is Truly a Great film for its genre. Everyone should see this movie and if you are a fan of the franchise like myself, you are in for one Awesome surprise.
And even though we still have quite awhile until Fast 7 hits theaters, It is on my highly anticipated list already. Vin Diesel and the crew will be going up against one surprising yet great addition to the cast. He is a very familar action star; a damn good one at that. His name is..........well you'll see.

5990177,5,B00FF9SKSK,"""The Fast and the Furious"" movie series has had a very interesting evolution since the first film came out in the 2001.  The first one was an entertaining, but unremarkable, action film targeted to gear-heads and racing fanatics.  The sequel, ""2 Fast 2 Furious"", was incredibly underwhelming with a lackluster villain and Tyrese doing everything possible to make you dislike him.  Then, the producers tried a completely different route and change setting to Japan for ""Fast and the Furious:  Tokyo Drift"", and completely and utterly forgettable film that should have been the end of the franchise.

  Not to be deterred by their cash cow, the studio took one last shot by bringing back all the original characters in a fourth film ""Fast & Furious"".  This was like an injection of adrenaline that franchise sorely needed.  Reconnecting fans with the personalities they had developed an affection for in the first film was the first crucial step.  The next critical step was creating a story line that preserved car-racing soul of the films while raising the action and intensity with much bolder capers.

  The big success of the fourth film guaranteed that ""Fast Five"" would be made and it stepped the game up a notch by bringing back other notable characters from films 2, 3, and 4, while introducing The Rock to add more weight to the ensemble.  This fascinating Brazilian caper let to the ""Fast & Furious 6"", which, you can tell from the previews, takes the action and stunts up even another level.

  This film has The Rock's Luke Hobbs seeking out Dominic Toretto's crew to help him nab an organization of high-end thieves who are hijacking advanced military equipment.  One member of that organization has a special history with Toretto's crew.  The cat-and-mouse nature of the heists; the exotic locales; and high-octane action sequences have turned this franchise in a hybrid like `Bourne meets Bond meets Bullit'.  I thoroughly enjoyed this film and I'm very much looking forward to the 7th one in the series, due to be released in 2014.",1369958400,4,2046,4.926900584795321
5990198,5,B00FF9SKSK,"This movie is more than fast paced action and stunts. There is a lot of emotionally charged and exhilarating raw energy in almost every frame of this film. It is almost addictive in its approach. This film draws its energy from the story line and the well-defined multi layered and familiar characters. There is motivation and every action has a reaction and this film is riding that super highway. I thought Vin Diesel, Paul Walker and Dwayne Johnson were fantastic. They are integral to what works in this film and they just keep getting better. This film is very good and it went far beyond my expectations that were high in the first place. FAST & FURIOUS 6 went beyond the beyond!",1369785600,3,685,4.622950819672131
5990199,2,B00FF9SKSK,"Fast and The Furious 6 was an okay movie. These movies are great for any age group. It was an entertaining but it wasn't great. The soundtrack is what caught my attention during the whole film. When there was tense scene the music was at a slower pace than when things got exciting the beat was good. The plot behind this movie wasn't good. Like they shouldn't have added the Rock in to the series. Letty not dying wasn't that great because how do you not know who you're putting in the ground. The fight scences in this movie were terrible, in the first movie it was a lot better. With modern technology they could have made it better. I like how they brought back Tokyo Drift because not a lot of people saw that movie so if you haven't seen all the fast and furious movies you need to or you're just going to get confused. Overall it was a good entertaining film but just a little touch up than it would have been the best movie of the year.",1369785600,5,944,4.220994475138122
5990200,5,B00FF9SKSK,"To be completely Honest i think they should have stopped at the end of 5, fast 5 was a great ending and everyone was rich and happy, (((some spoiler alerts))) these movies have become much less about the cars and alot more about action adventure. I still like them.  This franchise has the potential to just keep going and going, The only thing i didn't like about this one was it was very, very predictable.. and yes, some of the action scenes were a little over the top and venturing into clearly unrealistic turf..  the only FF movie i didn't care for was Tokyo Drift and the end of this one points clearly to a tie in to that movie. I will keep watching.",1369699200,2,658,4.298387096774194
5990201,5,B00FF9SKSK,"My wife and I just saw F&F6 and both enjoyed it very much.  Whereas Fast 5 was all about the brawn and the brain 6, while certainly similar, keeps the brawn and puts in more heart.  Don't get me wrong, this movie isn't going to win any sentimentalists over but where Fast 5 felt like it was ripping pages out of a Superman versus Shazam slugfest of a comic book (which I loved; Fast 5 was over the top in a good way and was a terrific time at the movie theater and while F&F6 is a worthy successor Fast 5 edges it out in pure entertainment value) 6 really wraps its enormous arms around the family motif.  Now that doesn't mean that the action is on the severe decline as there are some fun action pieces but they are evenly spaced around a lot of moments that the characters from the series (all return excepting seeming brothers Tego Leo & Rico Santos) get to share as they try to figure out how to stop a bad guy and get Dom's girl back.

Now the being true to the family motif has run throughout this series but what I liked here (and you get this in Fast 5 as well but not nearly as well executed IMO) was how this group of tight individuals have grown into a family and it's not all about bloodlines and they are also willing to die for each other (which one character does).  Another character is also assassinated and the deaths of both of these characters were surprising and drew gasps from the audience.  And I doubt that they'll be returning!  So this movie has a bit more heart but it is still a slam bang roaring actioner.

What else can you expect from the movie?

> A ripping car chase
> A ripping car race
> Cars versus other...vehicles
> The gang of bad guys now are the good guys
> Some shots of nice cars
> Some shots of hot women dancing around nice cars
> A couple of hand-to-hand fight scenes (but, sorry, no Diesel v. the Rock round 2)
> Muscles
> A couple of surprising deaths
> Death-defying stunts
> Gravity-defying leaps of logic or story inconsistencies
> A huge airplane runway (and I mean that thing must be more than a few miles long--you'll know what I mean after you see it)
> A grab you by the throat set-up for the next movie
> Attractive stars and locales (London looks simply incredible)
> Some laughs
> Very good pacing
> Brightly lit and colorful...even at night
> A good time

What might you be surprised not to find here?

> Long, near salacious shots of cars
> Computer graphics of ignition or other firing systems...being, er, fired
> Eva Mendes (pity, that)

5990202,4,B00FF9SKSK,"If you weren't impressed with the trailers, or you're not a fan of this series, then you probably shouldn't bother with this movie. This entry won't win you over. Now, for the fans of this series (like myself) you are in for a treat!

""Fast and Furious 6"" (alternatively known as ""Furious Six"") picks up directly where ""Fast Five"" left off: with the revelation that Letty (Michelle Rodriquez) is alive. With this information, Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) persuades Dom (Vin Diesel) to help track down Owen Shaw (Luke Evans), a former soldier now leading a heist gang of murderers, whom Letty is working for. Dom now brings back the old crew to help bring down this gang and to figure where Letty's loyalties lie, resulting in ""vehicular warfare"".

""Fast Five"" brought new life to the franchise, and this entry takes what was great about ""Fast Five"" and expands on it, making this arguably the best chapter in the series.

THE GOOD

-The acting. No Oscar performances or anything, but still great. Most of the cast has returned in this film, and they all do a great job (again). It's one thing to have an awesome chase sequence, but it's another thing to have an awesome chase sequence with characters you actually care about, making some of the action pretty intense. Tyrese Gibson and Chris Bridges are great, their back-and-forth bickering is funny and they give their characters a great friendship. Dwayne Johnson was a great new addition to the cast in ""Fast Five"" and in this one he gives an even better performance, and delivers in every action sequence. Luke Evans isn't anything sort of amazing, but, he is still the best villain in the franchise so far. He seems to be having fun, and at least gets to participate in the action, making him more dangerous than anything Dom or his crew have ever faced before.

-The comedy. I was surprised out how many times I actually laughed during the movie. No laugh-out-loud moments or anything, but it still makes the movie more enjoyable. A lot of this is due to the chemistry the cast has, and their delivery of one liners make them even better. Does all the comedy work? No, but there wasn't a moment I found myself rolling my eyes or anything.

-There are also one or two twists here I wasn't expecting. This movies plot is as generic as you can get when it comes to action movies, but there were at least a couple of twists that made it more interesting than it needed to be.

-The action. Well shot, well directed, and well choreographed. Most of the credit here really goes to director Justin Lin, who gets better and better in each installment. Every chapter in the ""Fast and Furious"" series gives audiences car chases and action they have never seen before, and this movie follows that tradition. If you've seen the trailers, then you know how over the top and ridiculous the action gets (there's a certain sequence with an airplane that, although cool and original, must have a sixty mile long runway) but I never thought the movie crossed the line (or at least it never went to the extent of someone surviving an atomic bomb explosion in a refrigerator).

THE BAD

-The pacing. The movie seems to lag a bit in the middle, and there is a subplot with Brian (Paul Walker) that ends up not being important at all. The only reason why this is here is because Paul Walker is the original star of the series so they wanted to give him more to do. Cutting out this subplot would have fixed pacing issues and would have made the full movie short, sweet, and to the point.

-The plot of the movie: Letty is alive, there's some evil computer chip bad guys want, and the Rock and Vin Diesel try to stop them. There you go, that's the plot. This is the only reason why I gave the film four stars instead of five. However, there are twists and strong character moments that really save the movie from falling apart, and despite how clich the plot is in the movie, it knows what it's trying to be and doesn't take itself too seriously. Justin Lin is just trying to make a fun movie, and succeeds at that.

Overall, this is one of those movies that is really pointless to nitpick or criticize because it really doesn't try to be more than what it is: A dumb, yet entertaining action movie with strong characters. If you are a fan of this series, the only reason why you wouldn't like this is if you don't like how unrealistic the action has gotten (the first ""Fast and the Furious"", although over the top, does have somewhat realistic action). But for all the other fans of this series (or just action fans in general) you are in for a real thrill ride. Also, stay after the credits. There is something there fans will really appreciate, and got me very excited for ""Fast and Furious 7"". I honestly have no idea how this franchise has lasted so long, but somehow it's gotten even better! So screw it, the more the merrier!",1369612800,,4860,4.530216647662486
5990203,4,B00FF9SKSK,"I haven't always had a love affair with the F&F series.  I thought the first one was pretty dumb, hated the second, and never saw the third.  The fourth drew me in - I rented it at some point and found it really entertaining.  Then, they brought in The Rock for the fifth, and I knew I had to see it.  Justin Lin made a near perfect action movie with Fast Five, including one of the best action movie sequences (as unbelievable as it may be) of all time with the safe steal.  That heightened my expectations for Fast & Furious 6.

Let's get this out of the way first - this movie has a terrible, terrible script.  The dialogue is beyond horrible, to the point of eye rolling, and there are plot holes galore.  However, you don't go into a F&F movie expecting to see a great script or natural dialogue - you go in to see over the top action set pieces, fast cars, and butt kicking...and on those notes, it hits on all cylinders.

There isn't anything in this movie that tops the stolen safe from Fast Five, but a scene featuring a tank on a freeway comes pretty damn close.  The finale is also really intense, but I wish it would have been shot during the day instead of night, because a lot of what's going on is hard to see.  I understand it was probably done for editing purposes, but a lot of it was just so confusing during the end.  We get to see a lot of classic cars, testosterone, and explosions - overall, it's just a really fun movie, as ridiculous as it may be at points.

Don't get out of your seat right after the movie ends.  There's a scene at the end that is surprising and amazing.

Final Score: 4/5",1369612800,3,1616,4.184466019417476
5990204,5,B00FF9SKSK,"""Fast & Furious 6"" is great! This is how the story goes: Since Dom and Brian's Rio heist toppled a kingpin's empire and left their crew with $100 million, our heroes have scattered across the globe. But their inability to return home and living forever on the lam have left their lives incomplete. Meanwhile, Hobbs has been tracking an organization of lethally skilled mercenary drivers across 12 countries, whose mastermind is aided by a ruthless second-in-command revealed to be the love Dom thought was dead, Letty. The only way to stop the criminal outfit is to outmatch them at street level, so Hobbs asks Dom to assemble his elite team in London. Payment? Full pardons for all of them so they can return home and make their families whole again.

The cast led by Vin Diesel (who also produced) (as Dominic Toretto), Paul Walker (as Brian O'Conner) & Dwayne Johnson (as Luke Hobbs) is great. The directing by Justin Lin is great. The screenplay by Chris Morgan is great.

The music by Lucas Vidal is great. The cinematography by Stephen F. Windon is great. The film editing by Greg D'Auria, Kelly Matsumoto & Christian Wagner is great. The casting by Lucinda Syson is great. The production design by Jan Roelfs is great. The art direction by Guy Bradley, Toby Britton, Gavin Fitch, James Hambidge, Erik Polczwartek, Stuart Rose & Leslie Tomkins is great. The set decoration by Richard Roberts, set dressings by Paul Hearn, set designs by Charlotte Malynn is great. The costume design by Sanja Milkovic Hays is great. The special effects coordinated by Teresa Costa & Victoria Stokes, supervised by Pau Costa & Joss Williams is great. The visual effects coordinated by Katrina Barton, Sophie Cullen, James Greig, Anita Ho, Claudia Li, Sarah McLauchlan, Dennis Murillo, Allison Paul, Yinai Sun, Bill Wang & Sarah Yunrong Yu, supervised by Eric D. Christensen, Scott M. Davids, Sean Andrew Faden, Chris Harvey, Nathan McGuinness, Kelvin McIlwain, Boris Schmidt, David Vickery & Edson Williams is great. The stunts coordinated by Greg Powell & Spiro Razatos, fights coordinated by Olivier Schneider is great.

This is a great sequel that is well-done and well-made, also entertaining, too. This is also another great sequel to the ""Fast & Furious"" franchise and another sequel that keeps upping the game, in terms of plotline. Vin Diesel, Paul Walker & Dwayne Johnson return, yet again, for another ride in the fast lane. This is also one of the best sequels of the year and of the summer season, thus far. It is also one of the best movies of the summer season, thus far, as well.",1369526400,3,2582,4.890410958904109

5990207,4,B00FF9SKSK,"It is hard to believe that the 5th entry of a series, any movie series at that, is the best of the group.  Fast Five did just that with the Fast and Furious movies.  Over-the-top action sequences, a great cast of action stars and recognizable faces from each of the films before, and enough ridiculous dialogue to keep the humor both intentional and unintentional.  How could they top themselves?  Well, watch Fast & Furious 6, and you'll know how.

From the post-credits scene of Fast Five, we knew that Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) would be back in part 6.  Hobbs (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) and new partner, Riley (Gina Carano), investigate and find that Letty is a part of a new group of hijackers, similar to the crew we've come to know and love from the Fast & Furious series.  The leader and main target of this new group is Owen Shaw (Luke Evans, a name to keep tabs on, he'll be a much bigger star in the next couple years).  In order to properly combat this new group, Hobbs goes to Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), and has him put together his old team.  Following the events of Fast Five, the group is spread out all over the world:  Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) has just had a baby boy with Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster); Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson) parties with women in his personal jet all over the world; Tej Parker (Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges) gives back to the poor by rigging ATM machines; Han (Sung Kang) and Gisele (Gal Gadot) are trying to settle down in Tokyo.  They all get the call from Vin, and the group comes together to help Hobbs.  In return for bringing down Owen Shaw, Hobbs will allow them to figure out what happened to Letty, and give them  all pardons so that they can return back to the United States from being fugitives.

From the moment Hobbs is shown on screen, in a scene where he beats up a man as big as him by throwing him around an interrogation room, you know you are in for a ridiculous treat.  The action throughout this movies is top notch, from the first sequence where the group meets Owen Shaw and his team, featuring ""evil twins"" of everyone in Vin and Hobbs group, including a martial arts ass-kicker played by The Raid: Redemption star, Joe Taslim, and a large muscle bound body builder type, played by newcomer, Kim Kold.  Shaw and his team enlist the help of 'flip cars', which look like a cross between Indy 500 racing cars and the futuristic cars of Mad Max and The Road Warrior.  The chase sequence sees Hobbs jumping out of a car and onto another one from a bridge, and Letty shooting Dominic without knowing who he is.  It's ridiculous, but would we have it any other way?  This leads to more epic car chases, macho posturing between Hobbs and Dominic, as well as humorous turns by Roman and Tej.  A love subplot exists between Han and Gisele, Brian now is a father, and Owen's past of working with Braga (John Ortiz), the villain from the 4th film, are all made known throughout the film.

The action remains the focus, because let's face it, there's only so much ridiculous dialogue that can be said by Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, and The Rock.  We care about the characters, but only to set up the next action sequence.  Highlights are a fight between Rodriguez and Carano (twice!), Joe Taslim showing off his martial arts abilities, and a highway chase sequence featuring a tank destroying everything, including human life, without so much as blinking.  At one point in the sequence, you will suddenly suspend disbelief and watch multiple characters fly through the air as if they were non-superhero superheroes.  It doesn't matter, the fact remains that it's so much fun to watch, your brain will enjoy anything at this point because of the excellent film-making at hand by director and series takeover writer, Justin Lin.  The real treat is the final action sequence that sees the group chasing down a cargo jet on a runway (that might be 10 miles long with the amount of stuff that happens) that features flying cars, fights between everyone in the hero and villain group on top of cars and inside a cargo jet, twists, turns, and deaths of characters, leading to a pulse pounding conclusion so awesome and over-the-top, you'll have to catch your breath afterwards.

How could anything follow this?  Stick around to the final scene before the credits, and you'll be in disbelief as the series comes full circle and finally explains the strange Tokyo Drift movie and Han's inclusion in all of this, as well as the next movie's villain.  The creators of this series, mainly Justin Lin and Vin Diesel, known exactly which buttons to hit to make the series a who's who of action stars today, while creating a cohesive universe of characters for a movie that just started out as a typical action film back in 2001.  It hits all of the points it needs to:  HUGE action setpieces, a great cast, macho dialogue, hot women, fist fights and gun fights galore, and plot twists aplenty.  I for one love every single one of these movies, and cannot wait to see where they go from here.  Fast & Furious 7 is coming next year already, now with James Wan at the helm, I hope he can keep up the energy and fun that Justin Lin has brought with Fast Five and Fast & Furious 6.  I also hope Sylvester Stallone is taking notes for his Expendables movies, because the Fast & Furious movies are outdoing him by a long shot in terms of action and star power, and they show no sign of slowing down.  I'll be the first one to tell you that this is the best movie of the summer so far, and I'll watch this series until Vin Diesel is an old man flying through the air to save his children from driving a car over the top of a skyscraper.",1369526400,11,5671,4.5048828125
