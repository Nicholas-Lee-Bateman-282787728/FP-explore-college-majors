""King of the Carnival"" (1955) exists solely for the purpose of recycling stock footage from the far-superior ""Daredevils of the Red Circle"" (1939). The overall production quality is embarrassing.

Half of what I watch are the serials I love so much. Whatever you do , don't pass it up because of the other reveiws. Stock footage shmootage. It's all good fun. I've watched it about ten times now and know I'll see it plenty of more times to come.",1126137600,2,403,3.926829268292683

It is Dullsville incorporated with poor production values, a lacklustre but sometimes unintentionally hilarious script, dull acting to match the screenplay and other sundry deficiencies. Only positive aspect: the usual good print from Republic Home Video.",972864000,2,345,5.290909090909091
