8168174,5,B000MEYK6E,Amazing! So much in here about all story-types. I refer to it often. VERY useful. Thoroughly recommend.,1516060800,,103,5.117647058823529
8168175,5,B000MEYK6E,"Great short version of James Bonnet's 2 day seminar (which I've attended), I think this film does a really great job of helping the viewer to see James's life changing story model. It had a majorly profound effect on me, and while I loved the book Stealing Fire From The Gods, this helped to give a more clear understanding of the basics of the story model and the amazing story structure tricks that James Bonnet has honed over the years. Really great content and can't say enough about how you will be happy with it if you purchase it.",1397606400,,537,4.434343434343434
8168176,1,B000MEYK6E,"The video content is great James Bonnet's presentation is full of helpfull tips and very well structured speech, nonetheless the DVD case and overall packaging is the worse ever, if you are charging close to 30$ for this at least make sure the cover has a good print on it. at the end is the product image, this is packaged so bad that I don't won't to have it on my bookshelf. net being the content so good I do believe it deserve better packaging.",1351382400,,449,4.294117647058823
8168177,5,B000MEYK6E,"James Bonnet,even though he doesn't know it is one of my favorite mentors in the art and business of storytelling through the film medium. His lessons can apply to everything from adding more dimension to an RPG video game to making a concept album or rock opera. His main argument is that the best stories mirror the happenings in our own psyches and the way the higher and lower brain functions feud ala good vs. evil. You are stuck in the middle of the tug-of-war between a spiritual against physical centered-consciousness.

A good example is when somebody thinks short-term versus long term (is this decision going to be damaging in the long run despite the pleasure I will get in the short-term?). You can put a short-term decision like stealing or having an affair (physical) against the better long-term decisions of keeping integrity and faithful. What makes the conflict hard is that the physical options are usually more attractive to us even though the spiritual options are much better overall (I can use this money even though it's not mine and I could get in trouble for it to go on a month long vacation! This lady might not be my wife but when will I ever get a chance to fool around with a person this sexy again?). When crap hits the fan (the accountant stealing money is caught by the chairman or the wife finds out about the affair) the person caught up in the battle is an antihero. If they resist temptation and do the right thing, they are a hero. Great stories magnify these simple psychological conflicts in numerous ways Mr. Bonnet will expertly explain.

There are so many nuggets of wisdom in this DVD that I've watched it twice since receiving it a week and a half ago and plan on watching it once again in about a week. I hope James has a Vol. 2 come out soon that perhaps will focus on some more of his concepts not really covered in this volume, such as the sugar coat and the process of using feelings to guide you in the creation of stories. I cannot wait for his new book coming out ""Cracking the Story Code"" in 2010!",1254960000,,2053,4.4866310160427805
8168178,3,B000MEYK6E,"I expect the impact of this DVD will be different for different people. In short, it's a great overview of the detailed content in Bonnet's book 'Stealing Fire from the Gods', but it's really just an introduction to the whole theory; which means it may even function as a good introduction to mythic storytelling theory in general.

The DVD is a great taste of the countless insights in Bonnet's book, which I highly recommend.",1202860800,,427,4.77027027027027
