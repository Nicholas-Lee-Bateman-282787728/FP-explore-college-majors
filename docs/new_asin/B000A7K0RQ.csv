2697568,2,B000A7K0RQ,"The Movie is an excellent 50's Sci Fi Starring John Agar, Love these ol' Things.
Now this DVD that it shows here is from Retroflicks...is not a commercial pressed DVD it is a DVDR and when it was available it sold for $15 here at Amazon. The Movie itself is OK I am just upset that it was never mentioned on this site about it being a DVDR and the Price it sold for....I wanted it, so I kept it because no offical DVD has ever been released.

2697573,5,B000A7K0RQ,"Running at just under and hour - it was shot as a Pilot for CBS, I believe -  ""Destination Space"" manages to pack in suspense, a bit of soap opera dramatics and seeds of things to come.  Director Joseph Pevney went on to direct 14 episodes of the original Star Trek series including ""City on the Edge of Forever"", ""A Taste of Armageddon"" and ""The Trouble with Tribbles.""  Watch the pacing, the character interaction, the camera shots and, if you're a fan of the original Star Trek, you should find ideas more fully explored in the series.

The story revolves around an orbiting space station built as a planned launching point for a lunar mission.  Along with the introduction of emotional drama at home on any soap opera, there are political and financial considerations explored that could just as easily be from 2015 instead of 1959. The movie shines as the crew races to prevent almost certain disaster.  Again, if you're a fan of the original Star Trek series, watch the suspense unfold here while keeping the plot pacing of the TV series in mind.

One more thing,  watch how the end credits scroll across the screen, from bottom to top.  It may remind you of a certain other movie franchise involving Stars and Wars....

Very recommended for anyone who is a fan of 1950s/60s science fiction.",1438992000,,1297,4.674008810572687

Of all the 'Space' movies of this era, this has to be the only one that spends half it's footage before a mock Senate Appropriations Committee. Every time I think I have finally seen The Worst Movie Ever Made, something like this comes along.

However, the DVD has a continuous on-screen logo superimposed over the move throughout its entire length. This was a major disappointment and a distraction from the movie which I generally enjoyed.

2697592,3,B000A7K0RQ,"A movie for dyed-in-the-wool space buffs.  While not ""truly awful,"" as are some lower-end space sagas, a grade ""B"" is on the generous side. It helps to know that this was created as a pilot for a television series ... which was never completed.
The movie uses sequences from George Pal's unique flop, Conquest of Space; and obviously, the title ""Destination Space"" is a merger of two Pal movies (Destination Moon and Conquest of Space). Although the technical details are reasonably good for the era (1959), outright goofy sequences are also present. Consider the sequence in which astronauts are towed behind a space tug while holding ropes, and the tug's rocket engine is blasting right at them! There is also a sequence where astronauts jump off from a space ship toward the space station a hundred meters or so away. How are they going to brake their impact? And what if they miss? George Pal was a strong believer in atomic propulsion for space exploration ... which turned out not to be essential ... and in fact has not happened yet.
A side plot involves a congressman who questions the utility of the giant-rotating-wheel  space station ... a concept strongly championed by von Braun. In the movie he is the ""wrecker"" threatening the project. In retrospect, it seems the congress man was right ...  the giant space wheel, while nice, is simply too expensive. Perhaps the most interesting part of the movie is the developing love triangle. ... and that says a lot.",1367798400,4,1471,4.8063241106719365

2697594,2,B000A7K0RQ,"If you like movies you can laugh at, this is one for you.  We have the movie ""Conquest of Space"",  The makers of ""Destination Space"" took a LOT of clips from Conquest and merged them into their movie.  The plot is supposed to be serious, but seeing all the clips from another movie makes it mostly laughable.  If you are expecting something serious, you will not like this.  But if you have seen Conquest of Space and want a laugh, this is the movie for you.",1365724800,,458,4.27906976744186
2697595,1,B000A7K0RQ,"I generally like old science fiction, e.g., Rocketship X-M, Forbidden Planet, etc. So I was interested to see this, since the actors were known to me.

Whether the science was accurate or not isn't the point - the point is that it fired the imagination and fired up the brain.

Image quality: Very good
Genre stars worth noting: John Agar; Cecil Kellaway; Robert Cornthwaite
Extras: Trailer for ""The Unearthly""

Surprisingly entertaining TV pilot for a never-made series in 1959. The theme of bureaucrats and cost-cutting vs. exploring space as a continuation of good old American know-how was quite effective, though I can see how it would bore some. Well-acted. Special effects were good seeing as how they all came from George Pal's ""Conquest of Space"" as noted by others.

It's still the single most mysteriously beautiful thing I ever saw in a science fiction film, and I've seen two or three.

The footage of the space station and vehicles was all taken from ""The Conquest of Space"", but the actors are all original and some well known.  It was a pity that this did not see a wider audience and at least a season of episodes.

Note that this is B&W and has the original Maxwell House adverts as part of the program.

2697608,4,B000A7K0RQ,"Destination Space is a real sleeper, I was expecting an average silly run of the mill, 1950's ""B"" space movie plot line but boy did I get a surprise. This obscure unsold TV pilot film takes a very realistic approach to presenting the hazards of space travel and the difficulties the space agency has on justifing their expensive expenditures. I especially found this a unique viewing experience since I work in aerospace logistics for the government myself. This film hit home for me and I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to see a dramatic space story that is trying to be as credible as possible for its time. There are no ray gun fights, marauding hostile aliens or rampaging creatures here. Just decent acting, good drama and above average visuals (thanks to the use of stock footage from George Pal's ""Conquest of Space"" mixed with original footage done for this film), in an effort to tell the story of the first space station to be built in earths orbit.
I highly recommend this little known gem and give it 4 out of 5 stars.",1239753600,60,1045,4.593582887700535

The political aspect to funding is rather spot on as are the concerns of the spouses of the astronauts (given the context of the times...), the effects, thought rather rudimentary provide some realism to the whole affair but are early attempts at such. The technical jargon rattled off comes off a bit contrived but given that no one knew what the procedures and such would be during spaceflight just yet, I give them a pass. An interesting insight into the race for space, any space junkie should spend the 50 minutes absorbing this memento to our early efforts to understand the far reaches of our world and have an amusing time doing so.",1479168000,,690,4.758333333333334

If I had to guess, I'd say it was a failed pilot that may have one day become ""Men Into Space"", a truly inspired 1959 look at US Space Efforts to colonize the moon. You'd do well to find some TV episodes of William Lundigan in "" Men Into Space"" from CBS, rather than try to stay awake through this ponderous, low-budget potboiler.

The story line is a bit dated, but in a way very much like today's NASA program problems...success has many fathers, but failure is an orphan.  There's an attempt to position a love story, but it takes a backseat to the technical and political problems of the storyline.  True the graphics are copied from other movies, but that doesn't detract from the overall story.  The only aspect that was a bit out of place was wearing coat and tie on board the space station, but it's all part of the 50's motif.  Highly recommend.",1468108800,2,674,4.483606557377049
