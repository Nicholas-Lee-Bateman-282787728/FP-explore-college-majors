7985900,1,B00008O2ZD,"I first started listening to Canned Heat in about 1968 or so. One of my favorite albums of all time is Livin the Blues by Canned Heat. Not much video of the group is available so I thought I might try this. What a mistake.

There are only four tracks on this, taken from TV performances. The first is black and white and it looks like the group is lip syncing On The Road Again. The other three are color and look like they are really doing the music. All the songs of Canned Heat don't add up to fifteen minutes, and there is a lot of stupid psychadelic camera work, so you can't see much. Between each track you are taken back to the selection screen and forced to listen to this really crummy computerized music until you can grab the remote to mute it or make your selection of which of the four songs you want to hear. The pop up feature is the same songs with text scrolling across the bottom of mostly uninteresting facts about the band etc.

I wanted to see Alan Wilson playing the harmonica because he is one of the best, but it's not on here. There is a video jukebox thing which is really crummy songs (one is Leon Russell doing a BLUEGRASS version of Jumpin' Jack Flash, if you can imagine THAT.)

So don't waste your money on this. I only gave it one star because there is no way to give it zero stars.",1110412800,14,1315,4.169291338582677
7985901,1,B00008O2ZD,"This DVD was a major disappointment. Not only is it too short but the performances are pretty reserved and not real interesting. The original (and best) guitarist Henry Vestine is present only on the lip-synched ""On the Road Again"" where we see an apparently medicated Alan Wilson delivering lyrics with the style of a fourth-grader giving an oral report on the Pilgrims arriving in America. It is not representative of what I consider America's greatest blues boogie band.

 Perhaps they will dig up some better live footage of the band but in the meantime, for Canned Heat fans, the low price of this DVD is about the only reason for buying it.",1091145600,13,646,4.758928571428571
7985902,4,B00008O2ZD,"I always thought Alan Wilson was a genius, and seeing him play and sing on ""On the Road Again"" comforted that opinion.  Alan is much more reserved on the other tracks (drugs?) but Bob Hite makes up with high energy.  Short but a must have for Canned Heat fans.
The other previews on this DVD are quite enjoyable as they dig out the best era performances for all the bands.",1083715200,4,372,4.3
