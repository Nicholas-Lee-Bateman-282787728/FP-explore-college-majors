7062466,5,B00UNEJ8DI,This has been a long time coming.  It was a favorite long ago and well received by me today.  Excellent quality DVDs.  I thank Warner Brothers for finally bringing this show back to us.  It's a little pricey but I waited for a long time.  Just glad to view these shows again.  Jack Elam makes this truly enjoyable.,1427760000,4,314,4.327586206896552
7062467,5,B00UNEJ8DI,"With newly remastered classic B&W TV series having now become a rarity, The Dakotas is a refreshing surprise. It arrived today and having never seen it before I couldn't wait to watch it. I started with the pilot episode which is excellent. It has a feel unlike any of the other Warner Bros. television westerns with a great cast and many familiar, but not overused faces. The acting is believable. Picture and sound quality is excellent and happily not a DVD-R though I have never had any problems with MOD DVD-R's. A BIG THANK YOU to the Warner Archives for The Dakotas, along with SFM, MPI, Shout and a few others still releasing classic B&W TV!!",1427328000,15,649,4.603448275862069
7062468,5,B00UNEJ8DI,"The short-lived program is considered a spin-off of Clint Walker's Cheyenne. The series follows the efforts of U.S. Marshal Frank Ragan (Larry Ward) and his three deputies, J. D.Smith (Jack Elam), Vance Porter (Mike Greene), and Del Stark (Chad Everett). All four characters initially appeared in a pilot April 1962 episode of Cheyenne entitled ""A Man Called Ragan"" - included in this set. However,the character of Cheyenne Bodie never appears in this episode.

Crisp clear vibrant black/white picture quality - grim,violent,dramatic episodes highly reminiscent of the early seasons of Gunsmoke and opening/closing credits similar to those of Bonanza, this is a highly entertaining western series.

Jack Elam became one of the most memorable supporting players in Hollywood, thanks not only to his near-demented screen persona but also to an out-of-kilter left eye, sightless from a childhood fight.

The program would only last there long enough to finish out Cheyenne's abbreviated seventh season. When viewers saw the eighteenth episode, ""Sanctuary at Crystal Springs"", they were shocked by a scene that depicted the lawmen killing two outlaws in a church, one of whom had caused injury to a pastor, played by Charles Irving, before dying. Calls for The Dakotas to end its run were answered virtually overnight. After just one more episode, the show was pulled. A twentieth episode, entitled ""Black Gold"", had been completed, but was never shown

7062501,5,B00UNEJ8DI,"I've only watched two episodes of this series so my objectivity may be somewhat limited.  I like it a lot.  Ahead of its time, a precursor to dark, gritty, unsentimental westerns like ""For a few dollars more,"" and ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly.""  And even later with ""The Unforgiven,"" and the great ""Deadwood"" series.  No movie ""stars"" in this series, just believable characters and excellent scripts.  The series was cancelled after the 18th episode because viewers were outraged by the killing of some outlaws in a church and the injury of a priest during the shootout.  I don't understand the condemnation:  were folks upset that the killings occurred in a church or that a priest was injured in a church?  Different times, different attitudes.

What can you say about Jack Elam, oneof the best charactor actors in the business. I thought Larry Ward did a fantastic job keeping the guys within the law which as we saw was not easy,props to Warner Bros. Fordoing their best to keep it Real. Please find and show the much talked about 20th episode. That would be most fitting for one, No the best western ever...If there are any of the cast still alive i want to thank you.

The Dakotas is about doing the right thing and team work the cast is top of the line featuring one of the great legends of film and TV Jack Elam. What an amazing actor everything from bad guy , good guy and funny guy. It's to bad they can't make these type of shows any more where are the Lone Rangers, Roy and Gene, Bronco Lanes, etc....

7062517,5,B00UNEJ8DI,"I watched this show when I was in high school and enjoyed it.  While I remembered very little about the show, I did buy it and am so happy I did.  It was a very thought-provoking adult western unlike the other Warner Bros. westerns and was in a class at Warners all by itself.  It is definitely darker than the others and  it dealt with many subjects such as bigotry, revenge and many others.  In fact, I'm probably enjoying it more now because I can appreciate more what the show was saying.
The stars of the show, Larry Ward, Chad Everett, Jack Elam and Michael Greene, do an excellent job.  Being very familiar with Jack Elam, it would be very easy to say that he steals the show.  He always has had a way about him and excellent delivery of his lines.  He can throw off his lines with the best of them.  But they play off of each other very well and they all have a chance to shine.  This show was early in Chad Everett's career before ""Medical Center"" came about and while he was under contract to Warner Bros..  Admittedly though, some of the time Michael Greene  is not given as much air-time as the others get.
Anybody who likes thoughtful adult westerns should definitely enjoy this show.",1464998400,2,1197,4.366515837104072

7062521,5,B00UNEJ8DI,"Here's a review from someone who just saw The Dakotas for the first time. Having no childhood memories or sentiment as I do for Gunsmoke, Have Gun, etc, I checked Amazon reviews and based on the praise, I went for it. It has proved to be a most welcome series in my TV collection. So if you've never seen this one and check the reviews from viewers who remember it, I agree it is a gritty, dark drama with intelligent dialogue and good stories. So don't take my word for it, read the other reviews but remember..I was around when this show was on, never saw it and I'm enjoying the hell out of it 50 years later. In other words, it still holds up. And one reviewer in the know mentioned ABC yanked it because it's 18th episode depicted outlaws being taken down in a church, drawing public cries to kill the show.
Imagine if those criers could see what's allowed on TV today!",1461801600,2,874,4.303030303030303
7062522,5,B00UNEJ8DI,"One of my favourite westerns. I always hope one day I would have it on DVD. I would now love to see released on DVD ""A Man Called Shenandoah"" which starred Robert Horton.

7062529,5,B00UNEJ8DI,"It was the best adult western on tv when it came out. Jack Elam in the story was a gunmen who changed his ways and became a deputy. But, he still had the heart of a gunmen that made him a great character. He was also the fastest on the draw then all of them. I heard he actually was the fastest on the draw of all the Hollywood actors. It was original renewed for the second season. Until they showed the 19 episode. In that they had to go inside a church to get the bad guys who killed all their hostages when they were caught. The up roar was so great the tv public did not want the shooting to take place in the church. It was cancelled right after that. The 20 episode was never aired that season. I would love to have it. I had bought this set from other sellers. Not all the CDs worked properly. These worked pretty well.",1451433600,4,827,4.0181818181818185

7062531,5,B00UNEJ8DI,"Very sharp, clear picture in beautiful B & W. Good writing, good acting. What is most surprising is that Jack Elam was not given a starring role in his own western series, following his performance in this show. Still menacing even as a good guy. There are not too many Marshals strong enough to control a deputy he has to face down and not fire. Larry Ward is fine as the Marshal; a cross between Gil Favor and Christopher George. I had not seen or even heard of this western until it came out on DVD (age 8 when it aired, with no TV.) Would never have bought it, if the price had not been dropped for Black Friday. The price is too high for a series most people have never seen. Bought it because I am a western TV and Jack Elam fan.

7062533,5,B00UNEJ8DI,"I remember this series mainly because my middle brother, who had a habit of nicknaming everything, renamed wonderful character actor Jack Elam ""Stickface"" or ""Sticky"" for short.  He wasn't being cruel it's just that he'd seen Elam play the villain from so many movies that when ever he'd appear in a film or TV show, he'd raise the alarm, ""Come see everyone, it's Sticky!""  To which I'd come running and our parents would look up from reading the evening paper (Daddy) or sewing (Momma) and we'd watch whatever program Elam was in.  Elam was always believable regardless the role he was cast, so it was indeed a pleasure to see him in an ongoing series for the short time it was broadcast.  Now I have all of the episodes and I'm enjoying ""ol' Sticky"" very much!  Jack Elam was a baad dude! (Sorry Shaft.)",1448582400,7,805,4.5625

7062538,5,B00UNEJ8DI,"Marshall Frank Rayan (Larry Ward), Deputies J.D. Smith (Jack Elam), Del Stark (Chad Everett), and Vance Porter (Mike Greene) topped the bill on this series.
  These four men came from different walks of life, but because of an unjust west they formed an unstoppable, unwaving  group of crime fighters who patrol The Dakotas. Joined by some of Hollywood's future heavyweights in the movies and television like DeForest Kelly, Telly Savalas, Russell Johnson, and many more who started their careers in the westerns.
  They are put into all kinds of trouble as they ride the badlands in search of injustice. Ride with them on their adventures and see what The Wild West was like, and see what ""Wild"" meant at a time when all that stood between justice and chaos was a man with a badge, and a fast gun arm.

Only recently has this become a problem for me with their movies and TV shows having happened earlier with the TV show ""Jericho."" At least that one I never gave a second chance.

7062545,5,B00UNEJ8DI,"I didn't remember this show from 'way back when', but I purchased it for two reasons:  The very positive reviews and Jack Elam.  Elam brings a different face to this show - 'Western cool' in the style of Steve McQueen's Josh Randall bounty hunter and a somewhat sardonic observer to the situation at hand.  The settings are a bit stark, especially when compared to the over produced shows of today, but it is a reminder that things aren't always flashing lights and glitter.

7062554,5,B00UNEJ8DI,"Like several of the other reviewers here, I also remember watching this when I was younger.  I was 8 years old according to the year this came out on TV and remember being totally enthralled with it even at that young age.  If I remember right Chad Everett had something to do with that.  However, I never forgot it and always wished I could watch it again but never imagined that a long ago series that only lasted a year would be released on DVD.  As soon as I saw that this was released I quickly ordered it.  Now that I've seen it again I realize why I really loved it.  I grew up with Westerns and have several of the old TV Westerns in my DVD collection but this series is now my most favorite.  I do believe it was ahead of its time.  Yes, it was more violent and gritty than the other ones, but it is also quality story telling.  The outlaws and other baddies are really nasty and will not hesitate to kill.  And the four marshals each have their own unique character and personalities.  I also agree that the Jack Elam character, J.D. ""let's kill 'em"" Smith is the heart of this show.  I love that his hat looks beat up like it should and his hair never does stay in place even with all that 60's hair goop they loved to use back then. The ""good guy"" marshals are allowed to smoke, drink, and look dusty when the plot calls for it.
There are still, of course, the usual 60's Western cliches but the story lines are so tight and well-constructed that you tend to overlook them.  The DVD transfer and sound quality is excellent.  It is all in black and white, of course, but for me this adds to the gritty feel of a good Western.  If you like the old TV Westerns, this series is a definitely must have.",1435104000,4,1709,4.18348623853211

Even better is this: a DVD with startlingly crisp resolution. If not for the public overreaction to the shooting of a pastor in episode 19, which caused its sudden cancellation, this series would have lasted and established itself as a landmark series along the lines of Have Gun, Will Travel. Well worth the money. Buy it, put it in the DVD player, and sit back and savor these gems. In an era when most heroes were kissing their horses and talking the bad guys to death, this show was a gritted precursor to the realist western era that arrived in the late 60s and early 70s in film. Best of all, Jack Elam got a chance to show a range of character he never got in other shows or movies, and what a lost treasure that was.

Chad Everett's portrayal of an incredibly handsome, idealist, and sensitive young lawman was spot on.  Larry Ward was tailor made for the principled Federal Marshall.  I can't say enough about Jack Elam.  He was great!  I loved his swagger and irreverent wit.  He has always been one of my favorite thoroughly un-rehabilitative bad guys in film.  It was fun seeing him as a kind of anti-hero in The Dakotas.  It's a shame that this series was canceled after only one season.  As good as season one was, I am sure that if it had been allowed to stay on, season two would have been even better.  I saw the episode that caused so much angst and eventually caused its cancellation.  I, for one, don't see what the ruckus was about.

7062599,5,B00UNEJ8DI,"The Dakotas was a solid western series from Warner Bros. that replaced Cheyenne on Monday nights.
I watched it and I enjoyed it.
Larry Ward, a character actor who appeared in numerous tv shows during the '60s and '70s, played Marshal Frank Ragan. (The same name of the character played by Tom Selleck on Blue Bloods, although his last name is spelled Reagan, like our great ex-President,) who kept the peace in the Dakota territories during the 1870s or 1880s.  His three deputies are played by Chad Everett, in his first major tv role, legendary western character actor Jack Elam and an actor named Michael Greene, whose other credits I'm not sure about.
Anyway, The Dakotas was a much more serious, grimmer western than most of the other Warner Bros. westerns of the period like Maverick, Sugarfoot, etc.  The Warner Bros. western it is probably closest in tone to is the excellent Lawman.  The Dakotas unlike any of the other Warner Bros. westerns (or detective series) also doesn't have a catchy theme song.  It does have an excellent instrumental theme composed by William Lava.
I enjoyed this series and looked forward to its return until the unfortunate episode where Deputy J.D. Smith played by Jack Elam shoots his way into a church that if offering the bad guy sanctuary.  Uh oh.  The next day my father showed me our newspaper that had a story prominently featured on the thousands of phone calls and telegrams ABC received about this unfortunate incident.  Soon after, The Dakotas was no more.  Too bad, another excellent show from the early 1960s gone much too soon.
I've watched the first three episodes of this set, (including the pilot where Ragan wears an eyepatch,) and the quality seems fine, all very good episodes.
If you want a serious, one hour, black and white western series from the period of so many great tv westerns, you could do much worse than The Dakotas.",1429920000,6,1887,4.7846153846153845
7062600,5,B00UNEJ8DI,"I first learned about The DAKOTAS many years ago, as a pre-teen. I had seen a few episodes and really enjoyed them, but, at some point, the series seemed to just disappear, and I couldn't figure out why.
Many years passed, and a friend re-introduced me to this excellent series, because he had copies of all of the episodes. He gave me some of my own copies...and I sat down to watch them.
WOW !!!
How in the WORLD did this series ever get cancelled ??  It was DYNAMITE !!!
The combination of series star LARRY WARD, CHAD EVERETT (who later went on to fame and fortune some six years later as the star of the successful CBS series Medical Center), Legendary Western tough guy JACK ELAM, and MICHAEL GREENE, an actor with a long list of film and movie credits, made for an unlikely , but explosive team, which, when combined, made for an excellent series with strong performances from all four men...which made it's cancellation after only 18 episodes were aired, one of the big crimes in television western history. With all of the silly, stupid series on the air back in 1963 (and the even GREATER number of silly , stupid series on the air TODAY, that get picked up for second, third , even fifth seasons), it is truly a travesty that this well-written, surperbly-acted, truly memorable series only lasted for 20 episodes...only 18 of which aired before ABC cancelled it....BUT WAIT ....
WHERE IS EPISODE 20 ??
It is common knowledge  that a 20th episode, entitled ""BLACK GOLD"" was actually completed...but never shown...
Maybe this is just an internet rumor, but if it was indeed true..
where is it ? and why wasn't it included in this collection?
Hopefully, someone at Warner Brothers or ABC can shed some light on this matter.
Anyway, I just received my DVD set, and I'm very pleased to FINALLY have this series in pristine condition !!!
THE DAKOTAS was the story of U.S. Marshal Frank Ragan and his three Deputies...who patrolled the Badlands of the Dakota Territory...enforcing law and order in the days before Statehood. Unlike other WB westerns, THE DAKOTAS was darker, grittier, more realistic. No Maverick-like light-heartedness or tongue-in-cheek stuff HERE.
Yes, it's true that Jack Elam was the series' breakout star, but I still believe that LARRY WARD , the series' real star, turned in a powerful performance as  U.S. Marshal Frank Ragan...and the conflict and chemistry between him and Elam truly made this series special. Ragan was a tough, efficient, unstoppable leader who, although he stuck to the letter of the law , wasn't afraid to occasionally bend it to protect his men or others in need. A widower whose young wife was murdered by  killers hired by a powerful man whose identity he learns in a later episode.  One of his most memorable lines was his answer to a guest star (Claude Akins) who told him he couldn't stop a whole town, was
""I'll stop the first SIX !!""
Classic line !!!  (Don't MESS with Ragan !!!)
Still another line, spoken to Chad Everett's character, Del Stark:
""You can't make deals with KILLERS. Haven't you learned that yet ?""
JACK ELAM as Deputy J.D. Smith , the former preacher's son turned hired assassin, was an incredibly inspired casting choice: a legendary screen bad guy in what may have been his only ""good guy"" role...yet, even so, he was still a ""bad"" good guy, the fastest and deadliest gun of the team, who occasionally reverted back to type, with only his friendship and respect for Marshall Ragan keeping him from going  all the way back to his ""dark side"" (and sometimes, even THAT wasn't even enough).
CHAD EVERETT as  Deputy Del Stark, was an orphan, the adopted son of a killer, who controlled a town with an iron hand , and whose murder of a close friend of Marshal Ragan was the catalyst for bringing this unlikely team together in the series pilot .The youngest and most sensitive member of the cast, he served as the team's ""conscience"". (and was also obviously added to draw in the young female viewers) .
MICHAEL GREENE as Deputy  Vance Porter ,was the Sheriff of the town where the series begins .The most-flawed and ""human"" of the four; an unsure man that seemed to lose himself in the bottle, until he later found the courage to stand up for what was right ...with help from Ragan, of course . Ragan to Vance: ""You call what YOU'RE doing...STANDING ??""
All four leads in this series played their roles exceedingly well...and were augmented by great guest stars...such as LEE VAN CLEEF, CLAUDE AKINS, DeFOREST KELLY, BEVERLY GARLAND, TELLY SAVALAS, DIANE BREWSTER (""Beaver's"" teacher and  Richard Kimble's deceased wife), JOANNA MOORE, STROTHER MARTIN, VICTOR FRENCH, ED NELSON and many more....
If you want one of the best western series ever made (despite it's undeservedly short run)....

And was enthralled at the time to see Jack Elam, almost always the villain to that point, playing a good guy, be it one with a past. I enjoyed it then with stories and characters that kept my interest. I thought then, and still believe today, the series deserved a longer run but the programming Gods had other ideas. Happy to see it finally released and am about half way through the episodes, enjoying them again. Warner Bros truly had some excellent western programing at the time, and this be among them. To my mind it it's on a par with Cheyenne, and other non Warner Bros classics such as Wanted Dead or Alive, and Have Gun Will Travel. Recommend highly.",1428969600,4,818,4.423841059602649
7062603,5,B00UNEJ8DI,"I simply have to start this review with a BIG THANK YOU to Warner Archive for finally bringing us DVDs of this excellent series.  Now I can stop nagging them for it on a regular basis.

At the risk of giving away my age, Ill admit to having been a teenager when THE DAKOTAS was telecast back in 1963.  While I did manage to acquire pirate DVDs of none-too-good prints a few years ago Ive waited 52 years for a commercial release and it has really made my year.  Note that, generally speaking, I hate to encourage piracy, but THE DAKOTAS is special.

As other reviewers have noted, the series consists of a pilot episode and 19 regular episodes.  The pilot was originally aired in April 1962 in the time slot usually occupied by CHEYENNE and caused a bit of confusion as the character of Cheyenne Brodie isn't even mentioned in the pilot.  The main series premiered in January 1963 and a few significant changes had been made in the intervening months.

The stories are set in the Dakota Territory sometime between 1876 and 1883.  The Battle of the Little Bighorn (1876) is mentioned in the dialogue and Yankton is still the Territorial Capital.  The Capital was moved to Bismarck in 1883.

For viewers who have never seen this series the differences between the pilot and the main series may be somewhat confusing.  It was even more confusing back in 1963 when ABC reran the pilot in the middle of the main series.  I hadnt seen the pilot when it was aired the previous spring and at first I thought that the characters were engaged in some sort of elaborate sting operation.  It was only toward the end of the episode that I realized that it was backstory.

In the pilot we meet Frank Ragan (Larry Ward) a burnt-out Federal Marshal who has recently resigned his commission.  However he still caries a telegram from the US Attorney General regretfully accepting his resignation and telling him that the post will be held open for 30 days in hopes that he will reconsider.  In the course of the episode he tells another character that he had been a marshal for years but finally resigned after his wife was murdered and he woke up in the hospital blind in one eye.  Now he has come, as a private citizen, to Stark City (a fictitious town) in response to a letter from a personal friend who is being menaced by Ben Stark, the local land baron.  He soon discovers that his friend has been murdered by Starks over-enthusiastic henchmen against their bosss orders.

In the course of the episode Ragan changes his mind about resigning and acquires three deputies.  J.D. Smith (Jack Elam, at the top of his career) is a professional gunfighter with a strong sense of poetic justice who is hired by Stark to kill Ragan but soon comes to respect Ragan and switches sides.  Starks adopted son Del (a young Chad Everett) has admired his adopted father until recently when the elder Stark has taken to strong-arm methods of driving new settlers off of what he considers his land.  Vance Porter (Michael Greene) is the ineffectual town sheriff who has turned to alcohol out of shame for being unable to stand up to Starks henchmen and bring true law and order to the town.  Together they manage to clean up the town and they ride off together.

When the main series premiered with the episode Return to Dryrock we see the characters after they have been working together for some time and have begun to form a bond.  This bond continues to evolve throughout the series and emphasizes the characters strengths and weaknesses making them much more than stock western types.  The writing, acting and direction are all very strong.  The scripts were well ahead of the times and stand up well after half a century.

While Ward is nominally the star Elam steals the show.  Indeed it was Elam who was the subject of a multi-page article in TV Guide back in 1963 when TV Guide had a higher level of journalism than it does now.  Elam had had a long career in supporting roles, mostly as bad guys.  This was his first chance at a major role, and a good guy to boot, and he really put his best work into it.  Ward, Everett and Greene had all paid their dues in supporting roles in Warners TV shows and movies and they turn in strong performances.  Oddly, Ward comes off as the least talented although that does seem to be the fault of the character who can be one-dimensional at times.  As the character evolves Wards acting improves.  After the series both Elam and Everett would go on to starring and large supporting roles in other series and movies. Ward and Greene would return to small supporting roles.

Many of the episodes nominally take place in actual Dakota towns, other place names are fictitious, but all were filmed on Laramie Street, Warners huge western set.  The directors really knew their way around these sets and used them creatively.  THE DAKOTAS has some of the best B&W cinematography to be seen anywhere.  Most episodes have a noir-ish feel which is perfectly aligned with the plots.

Theres an urban legend on the Internet to the effect that THE DAKOTAS was cancelled due to adverse audience reaction to the penultimate episode, Sanctuary at Crystal Springs, which involves a shootout in a church.  This is highly unlikely as ABC reran that episode during summer reruns.  Im absolutely positive about that as I made an audio tape of the episode at the time and I still have the tape.  If that episode had been responsible for the series being canceled ABC certainly wouldnt have rerun it.

The series may have been the victim of the curse of a January premiere.  In those days a TV series was typically 39 weeks beginning in September and ending in May.  Shows debuting at mid-season usually didn't acquire an audience because people's viewing patterns for the season were set.  Series that premiered in January were replacing shows that had been cancelled in the fall.  THE DAKOTAS replaced CHEYENNE, a series which had run for many years but was slipping in the ratings and up against strong competition on the other networks.  There were only 3 major networks in those days and they expected a much bigger share of the audience than they do now.

An even more likely reason for the cancellation may have been the general change in audience tastes.  For a decade there had been literally dozens of westerns on TV.  Warner had the longest list but other studios were well represented.  Most of them were cancelled between 1961 and 1965 and all of them were gone by 1975.  Indeed, westerns are still out of favor today.  A recent exception was HBOs popular DEADWOOD (2004-2006) which lasted three seasons but only 36 episodes, which would have been about the same as one season had been in 1963.  By the way, Deadwood is in South Dakota.

It was extremely well written with intelligent story lines and excellent acting. The four main leads are uniformly good in their roles as lawmen in the Dakotas region. The standout is Jack Elam, too often the bad guy, he plays a reformed outlaw now a deputy marshal and takes the hard edge towards keeping the peace. The guest stars are very good as well.
All the episodes are excellent, not a dull one among them. This is a gritty adult western which is superbly produced. The real shame is that it lasted only 19 episodes (plus the pilot). The episode which caused its demise ""Sanctuary At Crystal Springs"" is probably the best episode of the series, but at the time, understandable why there were protests about it. It was a kick in the face story that had me mesmerized for the whole time.
Buy this series; you will not be disappointed in one of the great TV shows of all time. You will watch this show over and over again.

PS-Memo to Warner Brothers: Please release Colt .45 on DVD. It is the only one from the stable yet to be released. Or give it to Shout Factory, I'm sure they'll release it",1501459200,,1220,4.495495495495495
