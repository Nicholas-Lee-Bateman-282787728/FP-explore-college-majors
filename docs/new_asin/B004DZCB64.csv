4335520,4,B004DZCB64,"Loved this show. The set up of the DVDs in the package was new to me. Some of the disks were loose. Despite some smodging and scratches from being loose, I was still able to watch all the disks. The picture and sound quality came through very well.",1323475200,,248,4.1875
4335521,4,B004DZCB64,"I have little idea which series was airing when I first picked up on Lexx, because it never really appealed to me at the time. I do remember that it showed on (I think) Channel 5 at some ungodly hour of the night in that odd hiatus between having finished watching Eurotrash and finally dragging myself upstairs to bed. It was certainly a head-turner with its (at the time) spectacular CGI-SFX and equally spectacular leading lady. At the same time it had a strange ""feel"" to it, being camp, complex and obviously not an ""American"" show (why that should count as a negative is beyond me now). Another count against it was that it seemed important to have seen the preceding episodes in order to understand what the he11 was going on. At the time it seemed easiest to write it off as an interesting oddity and just go to bed.

Now, looking for decent and engaging TV drama to watch, its potential called to me over the decades and I can (imperfectly) see these apparent failings as real strengths. I bought Lexx - Series 1 and only then discovered that it was also available in the much more pocket-friendly form of a 4-season boxset.

Lexx - the series
=================
Just to set the scene, Lexx ran over four seasons between its debut in 1997 and its closure in 2002 and it follows the adventures of a small, eclectic band of misfits as they travel the universe in their enormous (and stolen) spaceship, The Lexx. The main characters are: Stanley Tweedle (Brian Downey) an ex-security guard 4th class, arch traitor, agent of a failed rebellion, and accidental captain of the Lexx; Zev Bellringer (Eva Habermann/Xenia Seeberg), a renegade love-slave and Kai (Michael McManus), an emotionless, undead assassin, last of the Brunnen-G race and owner of a truly magnificent beehive hairdo. They are supported by a small cast of associates such as 790 (a detached robot head, deeply in love with Zev), Lyekka (Louise Wischermann), a cannibal and occasional Lexx crew member. The Lexx is are chased by His Divine Shadow, the sinister galactic overlord and erstwhile owner of the Lexx and the first series essentially deals with the crew's efforts to escape his malign attentions and find a safe haven. Look out for guest appearances from such thespian luminaries as Tim Curry, Rutger Hauer and Malcolm McDowell to name but a few. I wonder if ""Lexx"" features on any of their CV's?

Yes indeed, it is hugely camp and has a strong flavour of scifi from a bygone age - Barbarella, Zardoz, Flash Gordon and so-on. It is also not a little saucy, with plenty of sexual references. This is, as far as I can make out the uncut version, so look out for the famous ""shower scene"" in the second episode of the first series. Stanley is, of course, fixated on Zev, but being (how can I put this kindly?) a far from heroic hero, in appearance as well as deed, the chances of him ever getting his end away with her have to be pretty low.

Is it in any way flawed? I can't see it myself. The acting may be a little over the top but given the intentional campness of the whole thing, the overacting is really just a part of the deal. Bear in mind that later seasons go even further off-kilter (there's even a musical episode...!) and I have yet to determine whether they stray too far into the world of parody but, for the time being, if you accept all this for what it is, there is nothing to complain about. Yes, the CGI SFX look a little obvious to our sophisticated eye, but remember, this was produced nearly 15 years ago and, at the time, it must have been groundbreaking. Certainly the ""vision"" that the series tries to deliver is literally universal - the size of the Lexx and the distances it covers are mindboggling. This is one way in which Lexx scores over Firefly/Serenity, a series that I always felt was just a little constrained to what Joss Wheedon could fit on a large map. Lexx, by contrast, never worried about such humdrum practical limitations and, if ever it fails, it can hardly be the result of a lack of imagination or effort (of course, and to soothe the sensibilities of Browncoats, Firefly is a better series in many other ways and the comparison isn't entirely a fair one).

Series 1
========
This consists of four movie-length (2 hour) episodes: ""I Worship His Shadow"", ""Super Nova"", ""Eating Pattern"" and ""Giga Shadow"". The characters are introduced and Zev and Stanley steal the Lexx. Zev has a shower, Tim Curry want Stanley to have his babies and Kai goes to pieces. The Lexx has dinner and Rutger Hauer looks fabulous; then they all go back to the Cluster, but everyone's been eaten - oh noes! The acting is pretty rough and if I'm honest, these two hour long, feature length episodes do drag a bit. Let's be frank - they could have done with some editing.

Series 2
========
The second season consists of 20 episodes of a more conventional 45m in length: Mantrid, Terminal, Lyekka, Luvliner, Lafftrak, Stan's Trial, Love Grows, White Trash, 791, Wake the Dead, Nook, Norb, Twilight, Patches in the Sky, Woz, The Web, The Net, Brigadoom, Brizon and End of the Universe. Eva Habermann hands over the reins to Xenia Seeberg (as Xev) and Lyekka makes her entrance. The story arc revolves around our heroes' attempts to escape the clutches of the evil and potty scientist Dr Mantrid (who's goal in life is to destroy the Dark Universe. Well, everyone has to have a hobby, don't they?). Look out for the musical episode ""Brigadoom"".

Series 3
========
The thirteen episodes in Season 3 are: Fire and Water, May, Gametown, Boomtown, Gondola, K-Town, Tunnels, The Key, Garden, Battle, Girltown, The Beach and Heaven and Hell. The Lexx is caught up in a war between two planets (Fire and Water).

Series 4
========
The twenty episodes of Series 4 take place on a familiar ""Little Blue Planet"". Fortunately it's an alternative reality as the Lexx is hungry. The episodes are; Little Blue Planet, Texx Lexx, P4X, Stan Down, Xevivor, The Rock, Walpurgis Night, Vlad, Fluff Daddy, Magic Baby, A Midsummer's Nightmare, Bad Carrot, 769, Prime Ridge, Mort, Moss, Dutch Treat, The Game, Haley's Comet, Apocalexx Now, Viva Lexx Vegas, Trip, Lyekka vs Japan and Yo Way Yo. Look out for cameos from Hattie Hayridge and Craig Charles.

Production
==========
One complaint is the sound repro in which the dialogue tends to fade somewhat behind the ambient sound effects and score. This may be down to the settings on my TV as it seems to be a common problem and I generally overcome it by engaging the sub-titles. Unfortunately there are none on this release - a big negative for me.

Extras
======
The set includes some extras including: ""making of"" featurettes. I've only seen the Season 1 featurettes that come on the first two discs (there's one for each S1 episode) and they're pretty dire! Picture, if you will, the producer, stood outside his office and flanked by two of his crew. They are huddled against the driving rain (one has his coat pulled over his head to shelter him) and the producer announces that he is contractually obliged to fill an additional 20m per episode with some sort of extra (he reiterates this point several times in the documentaries). What follows is (inside in the dry, mercifully) the three crew men talking fairly unenthusiastically for 20m about the production of the series with almost no footage from the production itself. I watched (sorry fast forwarded through) the first two of these so perhaps I missed the really exciting third or fourth ""making of"" documentary, but I didn't feel in any way tempted to find out.

Summary
=======
Financial considerations aside, what you have here, however, is something a little special. I readily admit that I use the word ""little"" very deliberately: Lexx will never be looked on as a serious contender against Star Wars/Firefly/Star Trek/insert-fave-scifi-epic-here. It does fulfill a role as an enthusiastic, fairly well done epic, but its main strength is that has a sense of humour and doesn't try to take itself seriously. It won't be to everyone's tastes but if you approach it on those terms then you may well find yourself lost on this sexy, exciting, silly and even slightly mad journey. Enjoy",1323302400,12,8178,4.719887955182073

4335524,5,B004DZCB64,"Lexx is really nothing like Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, both are stand alone unique works, but it does carry a similar feel, in that it presents an almost surreal view of the universe, specifically when it comes to space travel. It is not your average cookie cutter sci fi show, where it seems ninety percent of sci fi, whether it be literature or media, follows some unseen formula. Specifically in season 2, the show demonstrates its ability to bring new ideas never touched upon in the realm of sci fi, including a full length musical in one episode, and it does so in a comically dark manner. I should mention that in many ways this is a b-show, with an often campy feel. The graphics at times, especially in the first two seasons are terrible, however, its unique characters and storylines make up for it. The main characters being Stan, the incompetent, accidental captain, Zev, the love slave who did not recieve the love slave brain implant, but did get the love slave body, 790, the robot head that accidentally recieved the love slave conditioning Zev was supposed to recieve, and Kai, an undead assassin who is incapable of expressing emotion, except perhaps through varius one liners such as, ""the dead do not squeeze and please."" This show definitely is not for everyone, and I would highly recomend watching a season or two of it on Hulu.com, where I watched it for the first time, before purchasing it. Two episodes that really stand out in my mind that truly demonstrate the show's uniqueness, and which potential buyers might want to check out, are Eating Pattern, where Rutger Hauer plays what I believe is one of his more unique sci fi roles, and 791, in which the love sick robot head obtains a cyborg body and may or may not rape a member of the crew. My only real complaint about the show would be that the ending felt a bit rushed, turning an apparent two or three potential episodes into one. Of course, endings never really matter much, it is the journey getting there that really matters, and the journey of the Lexx was a fun one.",1310688000,12,2063,4.608695652173913

4335549,3,B004DZCB64,"I had only seen the first year on TV many years ago so I ordered the complete set.
YAWN...
If you want to see it,  just watch the first year because every year after is just the same old stuff. Zev and Stan can't do squat so they wake up the dead guy (Kai) to save them from the bad situation of the day in every episode. Also in EVERY episode, it seems that Zev can't get satisfied sexually while Stan can't ever find anything to get sexually satisfied by and the dead guy doesn't care to get ANY which disappoints Zev to no end.  What makes things worse is there is no closed captioning on any disc so if you're hard of hearing... you'll need to turn it up.
I do appreciate Amazon getting this debacle together for a highly discounted price over what you'd normally have to pay if you pieced the episodes together yourself. It comes out to about $60 piecing all the years together while Amazon sells LEXX for just under $19 for the entire series.
Just wish it had been HD. The picture only fills about 60% of the screen so you might have squint your eyes to see that terrible hairdo on the dead guy! HA!
Oh yeah, like others said and they weren't kidding, the discs aren't numbered. I used a silver marks-a-lot to number which disc to watch first and so on.

4335555,5,B004DZCB64,"I love the Lexx series and therefore have given the nine discs for this series a 5-star rating. So what if the discs aren't numbered. Each of the discs (at least in the set I obtained) fully displays the episode titles for its content, so it is easy to figure out the order of the discs in the series. Or the five-digit codes displayed on the discs can be arranged in numerical order, which also corresponds to the correct play-back order.

The real disappointment is in the packaging. The nine discs are stored in two separate plastic containers. One of these holds six discs stacked on top of each other. The other container has three stacked discs. So if you want to view a particular disc, you have to remove all the discs stacked on top of it. Then while viewing the selected disc, I guess you're expected to leave the removed discs lying around, just waiting to be dropped or scratched. This is beyond idiotic from the standpoint of package design. Worse, the stacked discs are not easily removed from the containers, so every time you remove a disc, you risk breaking it.

The solution to this disc storage problem is to obtain a single plastic DVD case that unfolds to store each of the nine discs in order on separate mounts and has a clear plastic window that displays the paper display label from one of the old cases. Or if you are good with graphics, you can create a fancy label for your new large case. You can obtain the preferred all-in-one DVD case online at the Bags Unlimited website for about $3.50 a case. Then toss the stupid original cases in the trash where they belong. Problem solved.

Pic 1 below shows the single large Bags Unlimited DVD case that holds all nine LEXX DVD discs supported in order on separate ""pages."" The discs are arranged in the order indicated by their displayed five-digit codes. Pic 2 shows the large DVD case with some cool Lexx display art. As shown at Pic 1, an information display sheet is supported by clips within the case. The front side of this sheet shows the LEXX actors in an impressive pose and the rear side of the sheet, as shown at Pic 3, lists the four season contents of the discs with reference to their consecutive index codes and episode titles. The last Pic shows the back of the display art which summarizes the complete four seasons.

4335576,5,B004DZCB64,"Lexx, the extraordinary adult TV series, is rapidly disappearing from the U.S. marketplace. Echo Bridge has two separate versions still available, both somewhat sub-par in quality due to cramming multiple episodes on single-sided discs. That said, the price is right for the one version, and way too much for the other. Get the less expensive one with all 61 episodes squeezed onto nine discs, instead of those with individual packaging for each of the four seasons, or broken into groups spread among multiple cases.

Unless you do some homework, the whole Lexx series, in terms of available DVDs, is a mash-up of mixed presentations, most of them bits and pieces leftovers from when the show was sold under a few different company names, both European and North American. The gold standard of the series are the Alliance/Acorn DVDs, which are superior in every way, but relatively expensive accordingly. It also appears that except for a few remaining episodes, the Acorn discs are all but disappeared from most commercial outlets, including Amazon. A high-quality boxed set, if you can find one, is going to be expensive, likely in the $150.00 + range.

Unless you're a videophile, however, most customers will be happy with both sound and video of the Echo Bridge nine-disc, double-case version. What you get for less than $20 bucks is indeed extraordinary. Which brings us to the show itself. A veritable hodgepodge potpourri of loosely connected episodes where viewers are well advised to switch off the thinking part of their brains, and get more in touch with their inner lizard.

Theres something infectious, if not addictive, about the Lexx series. Overall, the modest production values and campy special effects are in keeping with the low-brow, pretentious, often silly and nonsensical plotlines. When the show is good, its some of the best and most unusual sci-fi fare around, almost epic at times, in its scope and directorial aspirations. The whole program reeks of being the proverbial labor-of-love for everyone involved, including an exceptional cast of main characters. What you won't love is when the show jumps its own offbeat tracks, and hobbles along as if you were watching an entirely different series. Fortunately the lapses are far and few between, but argument continues among fans as to whether the several shortcomings of the show doomed it to a premature cancellation.

Which finally brings us to the many qualities of the series, and the one in particular that stands apart from all others. Namely the outrageous, frequently hilarious slices of humor that punctuate Lexx from first episode to last. When the show is funny, it is very funny. This is not to say, though, that the program is pure comedy. When Lexx turns serious, as it often does, its satire is biting, its sexuality and violence uncompromising. And therein lies what is ultimately the most troubling aspect of the series. It seems as if the shows creators themselves were unsure whether they envisioned Lexx as a comedy with touches of drama, or saw it more as an eccentric but generally serious exercise in satire at its most visceral level.

Lexx comes with its own guarantee of sorts, from those who experience it. Theres something here for everyone, doled out in equal but unpredictable, erratic portions. In its own, very unique fashion, Lexx lives up to the otherwise cliche hype that claims youll laugh, youll gasp, youll groan, get angry and in the end, maybe cry a little.

As mentioned earlier, Lexx is fast leaving store shelves, virtual and otherwise, not because its a big seller nowadays, but because it joins the passing parade of what will one day be viewed as a kind of Charlie Chaplin sci-fi. A Keystone Cops version of early TV from the turn of the 21st century. Even so, I give Lexx my highest recommendation. Many folks will rightfully argue, however, that this show is definitely not for everyonean observation that I won't dispute. But for those who dare to tempt their tastes with something exotic, a bit erotic, plus an outlandishness that defies description, Lexx makes for an unforgettable journey.",1477267200,40,4122,5.0102189781021895

I have only re-watched the first two episodes and they look great played through my 4k blu-ray and 4k TV, the colors are bright and clear, in fact brighter than I remember when I first saw this series on cable. Also there are a couple of scenes that were not shown in the cable version but are here on the discs. The bad thing about these is that they are English only, no subtitles, no chapter search, you can only pick the episodes, and for those that care there are no extras or special features on any of the discs.

I've been there watching this from day one on TV, and I love it. There is nothing else quite like in all the two universes. At the same time LEXX derives their own convoluted plot lines, they are making fun of just about every bad SciFi out there. Season one is cheesy at times, but very necessary in understanding the full story background. And understanding how the bumbling ineptness of a security guard Stanley Tweedle not only lands Zev as a sex slave, but pulls in Kai their assassin and caused 790 to become just a robot head. All just to mistakenly escape on the most powerful weapon in the two universes. A 2 kilometer long living ship called the LEXX with Stanley as it's captain. Amazing apearance by Malcolm McDowell.

Season two continues the wacky adventure through the two universes with a change up in actresses that play Zev, whom they now call, Xev.

Season three heats up as the series BEST where the entire plot comes together, sex sells, and you get the most entertained by understanding the origins of our crew. I think if Malcolm McDowell was still in this series at this point, this would be where he would shine; and you'd know exactly which character he'd be playing here.

Season four starts to tie up loose ends, and gives us the true understanding of the origins of good and evil in the two universes. And we come to find out why exactly which universe they ended up in. It get's high spirited as it seems the writers must have been high at some point and said screw it, but the ending is conclusive, and leaves it open to the possibility of yet more adventure.",1470873600,,1750,4.56687898089172

4335584,4,B004DZCB64,"Sometimes very racy, always ""wth??"" in a good way! From beginning to end this series pushes limits. Sometimes a bit kinky, sometimes a bit political. Read between the lines and see the commentary on technology abused, on tyrannical societies gone amuck, on shallowness of society. It's mostly meant for fun, although it does present some interesting views on what is light versus dark, religious dogma, and plays significant fun on theoretical physics.

Nerds will love it. But be sure to go in it with full intention on suspending disbelief! Be prepared to laugh at it all, but it's not a ""comedy"" per se. If you're the type who's asking ""But how can the transporters on Star Trek possible work??"" then this may not be for you. This is about being a bit campy, a bit kinky, and having a very understated political bent.

It's a bit heady and a bit sexy, to some perverse extremes, and it's also just plain goofy! Watch a lowly security guard, who literally just wants the basic carnal pleasures of life, accidentally find himself in control of the greatest weapon of destruction in the two universes. Or is there something even more powerful??

In some ways this is adorable! In some ways it's too far out there for the more vanilla folks. But for all of racy content, whether smexual or political or cultural, or even sometimes a tiny bit religious, it's so obviously meant in fun that maybe more can enjoy this very unusual work than think they would.

I would give this 5 stars, except for a significant portion of the 3rd season which was written...or directed...or filmed...I'm NOT a professional critic!! All I know is, much of the 3rd season was absolutely awful!! I'm very sorry to say. Surely it hurts someone's feelings. But whatever it was they did for a good half a dozen or a dozen episodes was just disgusting. The IDEAS were just as interesting. I guess the writing didn't change. But for a while there they did that thing I've never sen anywhere but in BBC shows with...camera direction and scripting and directing...I really can't put it into words. It was terrible. But please, PLEASE sit through it! It gets better.  Although...perhaps the first half of the series has more ""magic"" than the second. but don't give up on it!

4335595,4,B004DZCB64,"Lexx is a science fiction series that follows the adventures of a group of mismatched individuals aboard the organic space craft Lexx. They travel through the  universes and encounter planets and strange adventures The most important function of the Lexx is its ability to destroy entire planets with a single, high-powered blast.
.
The main characters are:

Stanley H. Tweedle (Brian Downey), Security guard and by accident, captain of the Lexx.
Stanley is a neurotic and often irritating character, much like Jonathan Harris as Dr. Smith in Lost In Space.

Zev/Xev, part cluster lizard, and part renegade love slave. Played by Eva Habermann  (as Zev) in the first season and the first two episodes of the second season, and Xenia Seeberg (as Xev) thereafter . These two women are absolutely stunning, highly erotic and intriguing to watch, and are usually scantily clad.

Kai (Michael McManus), an emotionless, undead former assassin, in a way, his character is similar to Mr Spock on Star Trek, instead of pointy ears, he has the most unusual hair style, somewhat like a punk rocker, most of it falling on the front side of his face

790/791/769 (voiced by Jeffrey Hirschfield), a robot head that received the love slave programming meant for Zev, in love first with Zev, then, starting in season 3, with Kai. Think of Robby The Robot of Lost In Space, but just the head part.

The series ran for 4 seasons. In season 1, Stan, Zev and Kai accidentally steal the Lexx, the most powerful destructive weapon in the two universes. looking for a new home. The main conflict of the second season is the fight against their enemy Mantrid, the crew keeps getting into difficult situations and is usually rescued by Kai.
In the third season they reach the twin planets Fire and Water. The entire third season takes place on these two planets. In the last season, the Lexx travels to Earth looking for food.

The special effects are quite good, very nice space scenarios and some creepy lifeforms appear. If you like your science fiction to be erotic, there is quite a bit of it here, definitely not for young audiences.",1458259200,8,2113,4.81767955801105

I suspect this is just a repackage of the same nine VCD quality discs in the last Echo Bridge complete series release of Lexx.  While Series 1 looks fine, these will be on the first four discs, one for each of the TV movies that comprise that series.  Series 2 - 4 are 57 episodes CRAMMED onto five DVDs, and the bitrate suffers (that's like 10-11 episodes per disc, folks -- they're unsightly).  Buy the Canadian ""Alliance Entertainment"" editions instead.  They look like this:

... though the sets take up a bunch of space.

Both have the episodes spread over a proper number of discs, so you get a decent standard def presentation.  Too bad Echo Bridge is so cheap they can't spring for a few more discs and make this a nice set.  Or better yet, just give us BD-SDs (Blu-rays with standard def content) if they want to keep the disc count low but preserve picture integrity.

4335601,5,B004DZCB64,"This is one of the best sci-fi series ever but it has to be your cup of tea or you'll think it's just stupid.  It's a story about several misfits placed together, quite inadvertently, on the most powerful weapon/spaceship known in the universe and they escape other beings more loathsome than themselves...if that's possible.  They sink so low as to try and hide in the ""dark"" universe which includes earth.

It's kind of like a sic-fi Seinfeld in that you really don't like any of the characters but you end up pulling for them simply because everyone else is worse.  I personally think the shows just keep getting better and better and they certainly try to keep it fresh by trying new things.  The weapon/spaceship is a live being called ""Lexx"" that gets it's nourishment by eating planets.

It's generally a very dark series in both mood and humor.  I find a lot of the humor to be very clever and, to the casual viewer, it's easy to miss much of the story and therefore it's humor.  In the end, it's simply a bizarre sci-fi show that either sucks you in or doesn't.  I took the bait hook, line and sinker.

4335607,5,B004DZCB64,"How can one describe ""Lexx?"" It's a bit difficult, as the mood changes as the series progresses. For the most part it's a comedy; but the earlier seasons are also space-fantasy, and the fantastical elements do linger for the entirety of the show's run. Each season is so different, I feel almost like I'm reviewing four separate shows.

Season 1 is by far the most surreal, and has the most powerful atmosphere. The comedic elements are there, but are only one factor in the show's delightful weirdness. You're introduced to a universe (well, two universes) that feels vast and bizarre, with little rhyme or reason to its mold, with plot elements ranging from traditional science-fiction (with robots and bio-ships) to fantasy (with straight-up magic), to anachronisms (Victorian wedding dresses in an alien universe? Sure, why not!) ""Lexx"" isn't about logic; it's about atmosphere, and emotion. You have to just accept the world that the story presents you, and go with the flow.

Season 2 is more of a straight-up comedy, and feels like a sequel to the first season, rather than a simple continuation. I was disappointed to see the darker, more serious elements of the first season vanish; but the comedy was great. The new version of Xev Bellringer lacks the ethereal air of the original, but her bubbly personality fit with the new season's comical air, and she becomes just as lovable.

Season 3 returns to the more serious, surreal feel of Season 1. The first few episodes are intriguing, but after that the season starts to become tedious. The ""Fire and Water"" story arc just drags on and on, making one miss the episodic adventures of Season 2. The ongoing story arc worked well for Season 1, because Season 1 was only four movies; but for a traditionally styled TV series, it was just too long to drag out one storyline.

Season 4 jumped back into comedy, as the Lexx crew finds their way around Earth. This last season has a lot of good laughs, and two of the best episodes in the entire saga (""The Game,"" and ""Midsummer Nightmare""). But overall, Season 4 is the weakest; the introduction of Earth kills the otherworldly feel of the series, and reduces too much of the comedy to pop culture references.

Overall, a great series, and a must-see for any fan of ""weird"" shows. But be warned, trying to get into ""Lexx"" might feel more like trying to get into four different shows tied into each other (like the various ""Star Trek"" incarnations) than just one series.",1419465600,2,2472,4.766355140186916

It's ten times more entertaining, creative and imaginative than every other sci-fi series out there, except maybe for Farscape which I also bought the complete series and will begin watching when I'm done with Lexx.

Really though, I know some effects aren't good but if you can get past that then this is by far the best sci-fi series you'll get. With every new episode they dare to go even further instead of spending 99% of the episode inside the ship like all sci-fi series do and it's just so original you can't help but be enthralled by it.

Then you've got the BEST season which is S3 with the epic saga between the Fire & Water planets and its entire metaphysical plot about Heaven & Hell, plus all locations on Earth in the 4th season, like the stylish Transylvania episodes and the tropical beach in Xevivor, to name a few.

Lexx has something going for it that's rare and even exciting: it's just so damn imaginative. The plot can be hard to follow, the acting isn't always great, and the direction can seem pallid at times... but the art direction and just basic inventiveness and originality are remarkable. What Lexx does so well that few others shows can do is introduce you to a completely new world, something so fresh and bizarre that you can watch the same episode several times in different moods and have different experiences as a result.

And again, the art direction is ASTOUNDING: there are many scenes in this show, particularly the first and third season, that if frozen as a still and mounted as a poster would be better than the art in most people's homes. Lexx is like nothing you have ever seen before, or will again. It's very, very hard to describe it. You have to see it for yourself. You'll either hate it or, like me, join thousands who still think this is a series way ahead of its time, and the best & most underrated and underseen sci-fi to have ever graced the little screen.",1409011200,3,2457,4.600456621004566

4335616,1,B004DZCB64,"and unsophisticated ones at that.  I have watched almost every scifi program ever filmed and this one is at the bottom in terms of quality of the stories and writing.  The special effects were better in the original Star Trek (which predates lexx by over 30 years), much less the Next Generation (which predates by a few years and ran concurrently) .  I finally gave up 2 episodes into season 4 though I fast forwarded through several episodes though out the first three seasons.  The focus on sleazy sex antics in many episodes and the lack of any meaningful character development (Stanley and Zev do the same stupid things over and over and over again) drove me nuts.  790 and his love obsession....ewwwww.

There was no philosophy or anything educational like the various Star Treks.  Don't waste your time or money.",1402358400,3,819,4.76595744680851
4335617,4,B004DZCB64,"I'm not reviewing the series content itself, others have covered that, plus you can look up ""Lexx"" on Wikipedia if needed. I didn't discover the show on TV until the last 3 seasons, have never seen earlier episodes. You either have a certain sense of humor and appreciation of what was attempted by the series, or you don't. What I saw was very entertaining, not to mention Xenia Seeburg is not hard on the eyes!

Flaws:
Some have said the discs were flopping around in the cases. There IS a center post, and in my cases, the disks were attached to the post okay and in others, some disks went off the end, but no damage at all.

Some have said that there are scan lines at the top of the screen. I looked at a few episodes (first 20 seconds) at the very beginning on the first disc for the first season, and the last 3 episodes of the last disc for the last season to see how bad the scan lines are. Out of those 5 episodes, 3 were fine and 2 had the scan lines at the top of the screen. Thin, but no mistaking them. I decided that I can get used to them, and was expecting them on all discs anyway based on what someone said. So maybe it will turn out 40% of all episodes will have this, don't know, as I haven't had time to watch anything yet.

I also decided before purchase that if the scan lines were too annoying, I'd just use some black electrical tape along the top frame of the TV without touching the LED itself, to mask off the scan lines. I'm guessing that the scan line is about a 16th of an inch on my 42"" screen, maybe less. Yes, the scan line has light and dark elements that move back and forth, side to side. On my TV the scan line is only at the top.

Another flaw is that the discs have graphics on them, but they aren't labeled so you can't tell what season they are or what order they are supposed to be viewed. This is goofy as it turns out just below the Echo Bridge label on the left, there is a 5 digit number distinct to each disk. You start with the lowest number and then go to the disk with the next highest number, etc. Since the numbers are all different per disk, why couldn't they just put the Season and Episode numbers on there, too? That's so odd. In any case, keep your discs in order! But if you get them screwed up, you CAN get them in order. Also, they were on the spindles in correct order, top down, going from earliest to last.

What's great about this purchase? The price! If you're on the fence about getting this series because you've only seen a little of it, and don't want to spend $100 or more, this is a great deal.

The ones who mentioned the scan lines said releases by other companies didn't have the scan lines. But as best as I can tell, those other companies were charging somewhere between $80 to $130. My finances aren't so great right now, and I can afford $33.99 but not more than that at this time. Plus I was afraid I'd never see a deal like this again so I got it NOW. If I got scan lines on a $100 purchase then I'd give that 3 stars. But even if it turns out 90% of the episodes have scan lines, I can still give this 4 stars because of the price, and not having to buy individual seasons.

I'm very much looking forward to watching this series from start to finish, regardless of whether I use black tape or not!

What was the video quality like? It was fine for a DVD, though quick glances at other episodes revealed the video quality might be a tiny tad less than fine in places, but consistent with most series from that time period going to DVD.

4335621,2,B004DZCB64,"LEXX, the complete series.

Quick summary: seasons one & two rate 4 stars, season three rates 2 stars and season four rates 1 star and is still over rated.

The first season introduces the continuing characters and the style of the series: campy, funny, sometimes outrageous: counter-culture laced with satire.

Season two has two continuing villains that are not in all episodes and many other odd characters and planets. Satire and black comedy abound. Together the first two seasons are the very best shows of the series.

Season three takes place on two sort of conjoined plants: Fire (hell) and Water (heaven) with an immortal villain, Prince (the devil or maybe death) constantly dying and reappearing. Cliffhangers end each show until the final: A throwback to the old cheap action movie serials (i. e.  Buck Rogers) and comic books.  After a while the pseudo-theology, same main villain and settings get tiresome. Also it becomes too obvious that the four continuing characters are cartoon/comic book ""heroes"" and you may get tired of their predictability. Stanley's stupidity and selfishness and 791's monomania start to be annoying. Zev with her strange face and perfect body are always watchable.

Three leads never change their attire; Zev changes her body once (including a costume and hair style change plus new actor) and then in Season three converts her one-piece to a bikini, changes her hairstyle one more time. The biggest change: 791 switches its love to the (un) dead Kai. In season four Zev finally gets some different costumes.

The leads almost never initiate or make a credible effort to extract themselves from bad situations; they just go with the flow until something happens to resolve their problems.

Season four is set on our own plant, in the USA, and satire takes precedent along with a very dark comic view of our American persona. Unfortunately, Prince, the villain from season three returns. Nigel Bennett, the actor who plays Prince is good, but his character becomes too predicable. Other characters that were killed in season three also return. (Probably because there were so few actors left in Canada by this time.)

Paul Donovan, the creative force behind the series, should have brought in more writers with new ideas and approaches to keep up the originality and surprises. (Donovan is credited with writing 49 of the 61 episodes.)

THIS SF SERIES IS INTERRUPTED FOR A J.K. ROWLING STYLE CHESS GAME.

To continue, in season four, the series homes in on what Donovan or his bosses believe is the target audience teenage-young adult males who enjoy sex, violence, potty jokes and tasteless humor: welcome to sophomoric humor and a poor imitation of ""Mad Magazine"" type satire.",1367539200,4,2720,5.046875

I say this hardly to be unkind, hence my 5 stars, I love the show, but this show is NOT for everyone.  I say that and follow it up with, it is not for people who are unable to take a joke and are overly serious and sensitive.  I remember watching this in small parts in high school, loved it then.  I got older and got to watch all of it, and it is even better than I remembered.

If you like strange shows and opportunities to laugh, it is perfect.  The entire series is a live action Meme.  Some episodes do seem to drag out, but the show just seems to get better with each passing episode.  Some of the villains are strange and out there enough that I have used  them to inspire villains in my D&D games.  The Robot Head is so funny, his personal insults are legendary.  Kai is a bad ass and provides a basis for a lot of the quests.  Zev is insanely hot.  (people will complain the show objectifies women, but Zev is actually a very strong character)  She is the driving force behind a most of the plot.  And Stan is the character that rounds out the show very well, he also provides some of the most memorable moments in various scenes throughout the entire show.  I fell in love with all of the characters though.

Seriously, if you aren't easily offended or overly sensitive, and are not overly serious, you will enjoy this.  Check it out",1519430400,4,1581,4.40625
8426314,1,B004DZCB64,"All kinds of sci fi out there has something in it to appeal to a female audience, but this show has nothing. It seems to focus on the most repugnant and revolting storylines, mainly concerned with cannibalism and body parts flying everywhere. The sets are unprofessional and the graphics not much better. I got about four episodes in, waiting vainly for it to get better, and gave up.  Zev, the female character, seems to be in danger of getting sliced up in every episode, that's when she isn't nude in the shower with Stanley salivating over her. (Really? Do we have to show a woman nude in the shower? Seriously?) Its attempts to be clever really fell flat. First, there was no setting in which to place the humor, and second, it wasn't really funny. Hey, watching the original Star Trek series for the billionth time is much more enjoyable than this. If you're female, skip it.
