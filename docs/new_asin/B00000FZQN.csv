1212352,4,B00000FZQN,"SMASH-UP: THE STORY OF A WOMAN stars Susan Hayward (sister of Rita Hayworth) as Angie Evans, a young singer who ends up destroying part of her life through drinking. Angie is an up-and-coming nightclub and radio sensation. However, one night she meets a man with a voice of gold and they fall in love. Angie gives up her career to be a wife and later a mother. However, her husband hits the big time and she soon finds herself alone with the baby and a bottle of liquor. She slowly declines in alcoholism until she causes a tragic accident which almost costs her life and that of her child.

SMASH-UP is a movie with a lesson. It would seem almost like an after school special, except the movie is made so well it doesn't come off that way. Instead, what is captured on film is a fairly accurate portrayal of what can happen to a person when they become addicted to alcohol. The acting is good and the movie has a very beautiful score. Not too shabby for a preachy, anti-drinking movie.",1077235200,,986,4.417582417582418
1212353,2,B00000FZQN,"Touted as a female version of The Lost Weekend, this was Susan Hayward's breakthrough role for which she was nominated for an Academy Award. (She wouldn't win until 10 years later with I Want to Live). As a nightclub singer who marries and exchanges her career for the bottle, Hayward prefigures her alcoholic Lillian Roth in I'll Cry Tomorrow, with the same physicality and her being a ""charming"" drunk (as opposed to a nasty one). In her drunk scenes she even uses the facial grimaces that she would go further with in Tomorrow, and she's willing to make herself look silly, with messy hair. Unfortunately an air of B-movie hangs over this production, and Hayward is yet to have the bullish bravado that would make her such an entertaining actress in the 1950's. Things aren't helped by her doing her own singing since it is as ill-advised as in I'll Cry Tomorrow. The B mentailty extends to the character of her also singing husband played by Lee Bowman. Bowman sounds as if his singing his dubbed, his acting is stiff, and when his wife starts drinking he never thinks to ask her why. His only reaction is stern disapproval.  His pianist, Eddie Albert is far more sympathetic and ""modern"" in attitude towards Susan. It's nice to see too that she kept him around for Tomorrow, though I could have done without his habit of chewing gum. The psychology of why Hayward drinks is based on her feelings of low self-esteem. When she marries, she abandons her career to play housewife and mother for Bowman but once he hits it big, and employs household staff and a nanny, Hayward becomes idle. She had drunk before she went on stage to sing but one glass at the most. Here her insecurities about her worth, including a fear that Bowman is being chased by his assistant Marsha Hunt, lead her to drink more. The word ""blame"" is thrown around a lot yet it seems Susan must be threatend by the death of her child in a fire before she is willing to face her problem, with an odd back to the camera admission, that seems to suggest that a sequel may have been contemplated! In spite of this film running overtime, director Stuart Heisler provides some redemptive touches. A shot of Hayward and Bowman in shadow profile in their first embrace, some sadistic close-ups of the child in pneumatic pain, and a tart conversation between Hayward and Hunt which leads to a much talked of but disappointing catfight that is over before it has begun. Heisler also doesn't manage to avoid the cliche of an unseen orchestra supporting a lone singer, particularly noticeable in a radio spot with Bowman and Albert.",974419200,4,2592,4.6593886462882095

Hayward would play this type of role several times, and she's an expert at it. One can't help but wonder why she was so vulnerable to her ladder-climbing husband. Susan Hayward was a woman who could take care of herself. It cracks me up that her daughter was referred to as ""The baby"" up until the end of the movie. The poor little girl never got a name! Keep your standards low, and you'll enjoy a mid-to-late-forties melodrama. Poor Eddie Albert. He was always the unmarried sidekick.",1473465600,2,636,4.738738738738738

The lovely Susan Hayward gives an inspiring performance as a successful woman, turned housewife and mother, who completes her downward spiral into self-loathing and drinking. Hayward plays a nightclub singer (Angie) who puts her success on the back-burner to allow her husband the chance to bask in the limelight. Now restored and digitally remastered, Smash-Up remains a brilliant look at the soul of a tortured woman and how quickly a marriage can suffer whether it be fame, fortune, children or simply jealousy.

1212641,4,B00000FZQN,"According to the Internet Movie Database, this Susan Hayward movie Smash-Up is based on the life of the wonderful 1930s singer and actress Dixie Lee.  Dixie married Bing Crosby at the age of 18.  They had four sons, two of which would later commit suicide.  Her talent and on-screen radiance may well have made her a major star, were it not for her severe alcoholism.  Tragically, she died at the early age of 40 from ovarian cancer.  In my opinion, Dixies best film is Love in Bloom, a sweet and lovely romance, with George Burns and Gracie Allen as the comic relief.  See:  IMDb:  Dixie Lee

PS:  Sorry tvtv3, but Susan Hayward is not the sister of Rita Hayworth.  Yes, they were both born in Brooklyn in 1917 and 1918 respectively, and strangely their stage names both begin with Hayw, but Susans birth name was Marrener, Ritas family name was Cansino.",1405555200,2,855,4.596026490066225

The story begins with Angelica Conway who gives up her singing career to become wife and mother, only to watch her husband's stardom rise. While Angelica (Susan Hayward) sits at home, bored and left alone while her husband is busy with his celebrity status, Hayward turns to alcohol to relieve her loneliness and emptiness. Next enters her husband's secretary, Miss Gray, whom Susan Hayward is suspicious of having an affair with her husband. Hayward's jealousy over her husband's secretary, combined with her alcoholism spirals out of control until her husband's exasperation with her, causes her to leave.

Angelica, Susan Hayward, hopes to recapture her own career with the help and aid of their friend played by a young and talented, Eddie Albert. Hayward begins singing again, but her career soon ends when her drinking gets in the way of her success. Alone and miserable, she frequents many bars in one night and passes out on a stranger's doorstep. The next morning she is determined to get her daughter back, whom her husband has not allowed her to see. While visiting the young daughter, Hayward is intoxicated again and drops a lit cigarette, nearly causing her little girl's death as she is engulfed in flames, while Hayward is drunkenly unconscious in the living room.

See how this tragedy ends. Does Hayward overcome her drinking problem? Does she get her husband and daughter back, or does her life continue to crash and burn?

A really good watch! I recommend this movie highly among the great, old classics. You'll be surprised at the twists and turns in this movie, and how it eventually all comes to a startling conclusion. Enjoy......",1381363200,3,1878,5.009615384615385

1212804,4,B00000FZQN,"You can definitely see the beginnings of Susan Hayward's performance (as drunken singing star Lillian Roth in 1955's ""I'll Cry Tomorrow"") in this, her very first Academy Award-nominated performance, 1947's SMASH-UP.

Susan Hayward stars as Angie Evans, a singer who gives away her career for marriage and motherhood. But when her husband Ken's (Lee Bowman) radio career suddenly shifts into high-gear, Angie--unable to cope in the harsh world spotlight--begins taking comfort in the bottom of champagne bottles.

Co-starring Marsha Hunt and Eddie Albert, SMASH-UP does offer a blueprint for the eventual performance which Hayward gave in ""I'll Cry Tomorrow""; indeed the fictional Angie shares many similaries with real-life Lillian Roth. If there is a weak link in the cast it's Lee Bowman; he simply can't match the energy that Hayward generates in their scenes. Sometimes it's like Hayward is trying to revive a cold, dead fish.

1212805,2,B00000FZQN,"The film begins with a view of the New York Hospital where a woman lies bandaged in bed. She needs a drink. Then we see her life before as singer Angelica Evans in a nightclub. [Who is singing?] She meets her friend Ken Conway (his band folded). Will her singing career be ended by marriage? Will a child bring happiness? Do personal relationships help in show business? Ken sings the Western songs popular in those days. [Who is singing?] Angie has to go to the hospital and delivers a girl. Ken becomes more popular. Life is beautiful. Success means worrying about income tax. A performer must be prompted to become successful. What was she scared of? Ken Conway becomes even more popular and successful. [What need does he fill?] They move to Sutton Place on the upper East Side. It overlooks the East River where they can look down on people.

Does Angelica begin drinking too much? Will she have nightmares? Is there stress? ""Everything is just great."" Or is it? Martha will assist Ken in Chicago. Angel drank too much. Her baby gets sick, a special nurse is needed. Is there a problem in communicating? The ""bobby-soxers"" love Ken Conway, Is idleness best for rich wives? Does it cause alcoholism? Can Angel cure herself? Should she take more responsibility? Will she grow suspicious? Or lose her self-respect? What next? An angry drunk? ""He's gone, Mrs. Conway."" She remembers nothing, its all a blank. Will there be a divorce? Can she resume her career? Will there e more conflict among those show-business people? Will Angelica drink too much? Can anyone save her? Will they cover up the news? Will a dropped cigarette cause a tragedy? Dr. Lorenz provides a diagnostic over their problems, an explanation that cures the problems like a magic spell. All will be well again. Hollywood needs a happy ending for commercial success even if it departs from the past story.

This film is a psychological drama about relationships in show business and other groups. How do their problems compare to ""Ma and Pa Kettle"" or other films that deal with ordinary people? The message of this movie is that some expert can solve problems by just talking about them. That does not always cure the underlying causes of problems.

She is really hard to root for. You expect her to pick herself up by the bootstraps, but this is not a Cinderella story. It is a dated psychodrama about the hapless yearnings of the weaker sex. For that reason it's interesting to watch today. They couldn't have made Angela's worries more trivial, less substantial if they tried, but they're enough to send the damsel into a spiral of depression.

Susan was only considered as a supporting actress to Paramount's leading ladies before she broke away from the studio and made ""Smash-Up: The Story of a Woman"" with Walter Wagner's guidance. In the 1940's, when an actress approached 30 was considered an end of a career, Susan Hayward made a comeback. Susan Hayward was always the advisory to Paulette Goddard, Veronica Lake and others. Susan Hayward's best parts before Smash-Up were ""Adam Had Four Sons,"" and ""Among The Living."" Susan will keep you entertained throughout the whole movie. True, Lee Bowman's and Eddie Albert's performances were wooden but Susan makes up for the movie with her strong performance. Susan earned her first Oscar nomanitation with this movie. Susan Hayward never gave a bad performance. However, if you want to know what are the best Susan Hayward movies, here are my favorites: Adam Had Four Sons, Smash-Up: The Story of a Woman, My Foolish Heart, I Can Get It For You Wholesale, With a Song In My Heart, I'll Cry Tomorrow, I Want To Live, Back Street* my favorite, Say Goodbye to Maggie Cole.

Susan Hayward was, is, and always will be ""a movie star"".  Always.",1122940800,7,573,4.7
1212907,4,B00000FZQN,"Susan Hayward, impossibly young and beautiful, in this Walter Wanger production, portraying Angelica Evans, a young chanteuse with the world at her feet, but who doesn't want the world. She wants Ken Conway, part of an unemployed singing/songwriting duo (sexlessly portrayed by Lee Bowman), but he is socially beneath her. As the effervescent star of a family of performers (who happens to like a little drinkee now and then), Angelica lacks the ambition to continue her singing career. It's easy to understand why - not having been around in 1947, it's hard to imagine that the kind of singing and dancing that Hayward does as Angelica could ever be popular in real life. But, we digress - suffice to say she gives up her career for love. Hubby, and his partner, played by Eddie Albert get jobs as singing cowboys on the radio (another mysteriously popular career in old movies), and he pens a special song - a hideously slurpy ballad called ""Life Can Be Beautiful."" Dispensing with the cowboy routine, hubby sings the song on his radio show one night and become an overnight success, a teen idol - this, of course, is a time when teen idols *weren't* teenagers themselves. He gets hooked up with a management company, and acquires an assistant, a little minx named Martha, wickedly played by Marsha Hunt. Little Martha takes over many aspects of hubby's life, rendering Angelica useless, except as a milk machine for the baby. A few little drinkee-winkees help ease the pain (""It puts *poise* in apathetic people,"" she tells us), but with the drinkees come the attendant drunken dramas and Angelica becomes an embarrassment to her pop star husband. Martha happily manipulates the situation, making sure that Angelica knows that she's no longer needed in every way possible. This culminates in a drunken slapfest at a party, resulting in hubby moving out. Proven to be an unfit mother, Angelica loses custody of her child and naturally dives deeply into the bottle. Drunkenly deciding to kidnap her child, she does so, and nearly kills the child by setting the house on fire with a cigarette. This brings Angelica and hubby back together again, Martha admits there was never anything between them - she just wanted Angelica to *think* so, and everything works out perfectly, with hubby understanding that his wife's alcoholism was caused by his lack of attention to her. Life can be beautiful. Indeed.",1106352000,3,2402,4.933333333333334
1212908,4,B00000FZQN,"Susan Hayward, in the first of her five Oscar nominated performances (she should have won for this one, in my opinion!!), gives a riveting portrayal of a woman with a low self-esteem in which alcoholism nearly destroys her and all that is precious to her.  Her performance is right on target with many facets and dimensions that allow us to really feel right along with her, what she is going through.  In 1947 she was up against Rosalind Russell (Mourning Becomes Electra), Dorothy McGuire (Gentleman's Agreement), Joan Crawford (Possessed) and Loretta Young (The Farmer's Daughter).  Having seen all of the performances of the above and being a fan of all the actresses above, not favoring one over the other, I would have given my vote to Hayward!  In my opinion, she is better in this film than her other two alcoholic portrayals that earned her Oscar Nominations as well..namely, ""My Foolish Heart"" and ""I'll Cry Tomorrow"".

The rest of the film is ably abetted by a strong supporting cast with the possible exception of Lee Bowman who plays her ambivalent, non-empathetic husband.  He is wooden and unlikeable throughout.  Eddie Albert and Marsha Hunt turn in wonderful performance, the latter exceptional in two scenes...one in where she and Hayward have a catfight, the other in which she sacrifices her love for Bowman to do the honorable thing because she knows Bowman will never leave Hayward for her.

Soapy, yes, but good soap.

The DVD transfer is fine, but Alpha Video which produced this DVD cuts off the beginning UNIVERSAL/INTERNATIONAL logo which I feel is important to every picture that I watch.  This may be a minor thing but it irks me.  The rest of the DVD is just fine, the audio and picture great!!

I would give the movie five stars total were it not for Alpha's cheap video and the mediocre performance of Bowman.",1098144000,17,1841,4.828025477707007

As he becomes a star, he turns over many of the wife's duties (decorating and hosting) or even buying the gifts for his wife. As a result the insecure wife turns to alcohol.

Wonderful film of redemption.",1498780800,,336,4.6
7908546,5,B00000FZQN,"Gripping portrayal of an alcoholic singer who gives up her career to marry an up and coming singer. Susan Hayward is so great in this part, anticipating the graphic story of Lillian Roth in I'll Cry Tomorrow and the condemned alleged murderess in I Want to Live!

Smash up has its cliches but Susan Hayward ducks them all. The scene where she tells Eddie Albert about the Three worst things in life, via the Chinese or Egyptians, is spoken by Susan H. so deeply, that the outer mask of sorrow enters into herself and the image is startling and true art.
