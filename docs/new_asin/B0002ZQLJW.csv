2154267,4,B0002ZQLJW,"I know next to nothing about Methodists, but this film gave me a good introduction to it and John Wesley.  Thanks to this film, I have gained knowledge (always a good thing).  Yes, it is a vintage film, not remastered, which I enjoy just the same. If you don't appreciate vintage, this may not be for you.  Perhaps a more recent production with newer technology would be a better choice.

However, I do share, slightly, that same disappointment only because of this one song that I am currently looking for all over the internet. If anyone has any info on the choir song @ 31:53, please let me know.  I need title, music& lyrics.  Please share that with me if you know the song! This would be the only drawback to original vintage quality in this case.  Still, I learned important points that will stay with me and am amazed and thankful for Mr. Wesley's work.

Thanks in advance for any help with finding the title, lyrics & music.",1350345600,,932,4.4733727810650885
2154268,2,B0002ZQLJW,"Very 1950's, crackly audio, not what I expected.  Accurate sermons and time period detail, however, difficult to justify it's usage in a local church based on it's dated appearance.",1296604800,2,181,5.241379310344827
2154269,3,B0002ZQLJW,"Good for history, something to tuck under your hat as ""oh I didnt' know that"".  Not sure what I expected, but it fell short.",1226793600,,124,4.166666666666667
2154270,4,B0002ZQLJW,"This is a very interesting review of the life of John Wesley, founder of the Methodist church.  It is very enlightening and generates respect for the man and the struggles he went through to become the great man he was.  I would recommend this DVD to any others interested in learning about this great man.",1196726400,13,306,4.545454545454546
2154271,3,B0002ZQLJW,"We wanted to learn more about John Wesley, and the steaming video ""John Wesley: A Biography"" delivered in that respect, though the storyline is a bit simplistic to be entirely true and too short to provide much depth.  Since the biography was originally filmed back in 1954, the video and audio aren't up to modern standards and even marginal at times.  Nevertheless, for us, the information content outweighed the film's limitations.",1402012800,,434,5.098591549295775
2154272,4,B0002ZQLJW,"Let's face it, film quality is now better.  But this is an excellent job, if you're OK with a bit of age in its presentation.  I can develop a taste though for anything that has good content.  Maybe you can't.  The don't buy it.  I personally will watch it again.",1400457600,,263,4.18
2154273,5,B0002ZQLJW,"This one of the most wonderful historical video I have seen on Wesley. This godly man who was so persecuted but stayed faithful to the cause of God, is an inspiration to me. I highly recommend it.",1395705600,,196,4.324324324324325
2154274,5,B0002ZQLJW,"I have seen three bio / documentaries on John Wesley's life, and this was actually the most in depth into understanding who the man. I recommend it over the other two Wesley movies available here on Amazon, one newer movie on Instant streaming and one available by ordering the DVD.",1394323200,,282,4.66
2154275,4,B0002ZQLJW,"Excellent biography.  However, it definitely looks dated-- costumes, makeup, and picture quality.  There is a recent version (completed 2010)  that I haven't seen yet.",1392595200,,167,5.875
2154276,4,B0002ZQLJW,"It was interesting and done well for its time.  It gave more of an insight into how religion, no matter what kind is never allowed without descent.",1392163200,,147,4.444444444444445
2154277,4,B0002ZQLJW,"Good viewing and held our interest.  We have been studying the history of theologians and it is often enlightening to see how it is put into film.  Of course, we understand that there are enhancements, but based upon what I know about John Wesley and his method of study and teach, the movie does well.  What John Wesley studied, taught, and preached is far different from the doctrines  of the Methodist church of today.",1388448000,2,421,4.648648648648648
2154278,5,B0002ZQLJW,"Shares his beginning near death experience, the cruel wrath of the Gospels Opposition, and his continual seeking of GOD with DRAMA throughout!  Shares what he found as a minister of the Gospel of JESUS CHRIST that changed his entire life!
How does one KNOW beyond performance and show they're ready to go to JESUS?",1385769600,,314,4.814814814814815
2154279,3,B0002ZQLJW,"Reminded me of something I would have seen in high school - and slept through. Informative, if you can stay awake long enough. But I do like to have access to such history lessons, to help my grandchildren with their homework.",1379721600,,226,4.536585365853658
2154280,5,B0002ZQLJW,"Although this is an older film I chose to show it to our church because it is more comprehensive about Wesley's life than the newer version, and our church was not aware of all of Wesley's contributions to the Faith. The newer version is very good too, and deals more with Wesley's personal conversion in my opinion. Let the needs of your congregation determine which one you should use.",1379635200,,387,4.6231884057971016
2154281,3,B0002ZQLJW,"We were pleased in general with the content of the video.  It brought out specific events in his life and the struggles to bring light to the common English speakers, but cannot be considered comprehensive in any form.",1379116800,,218,4.7368421052631575
2154282,5,B0002ZQLJW,"Wesley was an amazing man of God and this documentary is the first (and only) documentary that gave true credit to the integrity and struggles he faced in his life!  It did not set him up on an altar as someone that he was not, neither did it throw him into the gutter to ""humanize"" (as we call it today) him in corrupt ways that he did not take (I've seen other documentaries that tried to be more ""relevant"" by doing that).

To my knowledge, this movie stays very close to his diary and attempts to be very accurate to history.

And, a huge plus, the acting is NOT PAINFUL in anyway, which is sometimes the case in these old religious documentary dramas.

Well worth it!  I am considering buying it myself!",1378944000,,708,4.333333333333333
2154283,4,B0002ZQLJW,Learned alot about the Methodists I didn't know. Like how the are a Protestant group. It's origins are in England.,1378944000,,114,4.75
2154284,5,B0002ZQLJW,"If you like religion, this is for you. Very informative. Inspiring. Full of RELIGION... I was personally blessed by the religious zeal displayed so emphatically in this biography of John Wesley.",1375056000,,194,5.290322580645161
2154285,5,B0002ZQLJW,"In 1954 I saw the original when I was about 10 years old.

Earlier we viewed the 2012 dvd on Wesley's life, which was so disappointing, It was like a Hollywood romance with very little substance. I then saw that the old film had been released on dvd and ordered it.

It was so inspiring and the parallels between life in South Africa and 18th century England are remarkable. Demonstrations, hi-jacking at gun point only now it is cars not horses. South Africa needs a John Wesley.

A dvd to be recommended.",1372377600,,506,4.478260869565218
2154286,4,B0002ZQLJW,"This movie is older, so the sound is a little off, but it accurately and effectively tells the story of John Wesley's life. I really enjoyed it.",1369440000,5,144,4.37037037037037
2154287,4,B0002ZQLJW,My adult Sunday school class enjoyed this classic movie.  The story captures many important parts of his life. Just prepare yourself for a movie made in the fifties.,1367798400,,165,4.892857142857143
2154288,1,B0002ZQLJW,"This biography of Wesley is accurate but leaves out much. There's no mention of Wesley's wife (or outrageous marital problems),  the structure of the Methodist organization which many claim accounted for it's success, or an explanation of Wesley's Doctrine of Christian Perfection which is considered by scholars to be his most important contribution to theology. It does present a brief overview of some of the key points of Wesley's life. However, the movie is so dated it's painful to watch. The sound is awful, the film quality poor, the acting atrocious. Quite a disappointment.",1364774400,2,583,5.202127659574468
2154289,4,B0002ZQLJW,"The content of the video was very encouraging. From what I now about John Wesley, the movie kept true. Apart from the content of the movie, the quality of the video stream was poor. The movie kept stopping on us, which was a bit distracting from the story.",1359072000,2,256,4.354166666666667
2154290,3,B0002ZQLJW,"I thought it'be a better production, but it looks like a low budget film (must have been. it certainly feels like a low budget movie). If you want to know more about John Wesley, look at an encyclopaedia. But if you want to know even more and want to take a look at time scenario, maybe it's worth it seeing this.",1356652800,,313,4.147540983606557
8035382,3,B0002ZQLJW,"I learned from this. I am not a Methodist so this was new territory for me. It was a bit slow for someone of my generation. If I'd seen it all in a mid-20th Century movie theatre, I am sure I would have been more entranced. Still, I enjoyed this.",1453507200,,246,3.94
8035383,5,B0002ZQLJW,This is a very inspiring account of the life of one of Christendom's giants.,1453161600,,76,4.5
8035384,3,B0002ZQLJW,Dramatization of the life of John Wesley and his connection to the Methodist religion. Useful information presented with sincerity; watchable but somewhat lengthy to retain interest.,1440806400,,182,6.038461538461538
8035385,2,B0002ZQLJW,Very old movie and not a good depiction of his life.,1440374400,,52,3.8181818181818183

8035387,3,B0002ZQLJW,Rather dated and rather dull.  Seems to be fairly accurate though.,1438214400,,66,5.0
8035388,5,B0002ZQLJW,It is interesting historically. It is culturally educational.,1431388800,,61,6.75
8035389,5,B0002ZQLJW,John Wesley was one of my favorite characters. His treatment in this book is quite good.,1419292800,,88,4.5625
8035390,4,B0002ZQLJW,"I liked the movie overall although the set was not very realistic in places, probably because it was a small budget production.  Definitely worth watching for learning about and understanding the life of John Wesley and, to a lesser extent, his brother Charles.",1415664000,,261,5.069767441860465
