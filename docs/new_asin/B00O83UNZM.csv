6728782,4,B00O83UNZM,"Currently (12/27/14) the last season of Becker is manufactured on demand.  However, the actual DVD Release is scheduled for January 13, 2015.",1419638400,5,141,5.409090909090909
6728783,2,B00O83UNZM,"I'll keep this brief. This show is by far the funniest show I've ever seen in my life. However, the last two seasons really killed it for me. Season 5 sees the departure of Reg from the diner and she was just irreplaceable. Season 6 sees another cast member in Bob depart which further takes the series down. Trust me, the first four seasons of this show are bar none the best comedy I've ever seen in my life.

And for the record Amazon lists this season as having 22 episodes, however there were only 13 episodes in this final season due to the poor ratings CBS was receiving while airing this show. Ended way too early, the producers should've shelled out the extra bucks to keep this cast together.",1419120000,31,702,4.4

6728804,5,B00O83UNZM,"If you loved seasons of one through four, you will love the final two seasons of curmudgeon Dr. John Becker and gang. Sure I miss the characters from the prior seasons, but the new characters are a great! The only negative criticism I have is not with the Becker gang, but it has to do with disk management: Why didn't those idiots give us, the viewer, an option to PLAY ALL.

6728809,3,B00O83UNZM,"Spent 15 hard-earned cash to find out what happened to John+Chris. Never got into this Sitcom, the jokes were OK but the whole set was drab. The office was drab, the dinner was drab, the apartment was drab. It was an acquired taste I suppose.",1450828800,,242,4.4

6728819,5,B00O83UNZM,Funniest sitcom of the early 2000's. Only TV show I ever purchased.,1441238400,,67,4.666666666666667
6728820,5,B00O83UNZM,"Becker hit the 3-2 pitch with the bases loaded with 2 out right out of the park for me. GRAND SLAM!!  Ted Danson finally found his niche in this sitcom. This series beat Seinfeld by a country mile. I was sad to see Regi and Bob depart from the show. Their replacements were LAME. I was bummed when this sitcom got cancelled. The cast was brilliant. I have to agree with other posters here that Season 6 sucked when Regi and Bob were replaced by that fat guy who was just not funny and Regi was replaced by Nancy Travis. She just didn't fill Regi's shoes well at all. Regi was cool and not hard to look at either. The fat guy who replaced Bob; who told him he was funny??  He was just stupid is all. I'll collect Seasons 1 through 5, but I'll pass on the Final Season. Never change horses in the middle of the stream. And like Murphy's Law; if something is working don't try to fix it.",1440547200,2,884,4.133720930232558

6728823,2,B00O83UNZM,"Ive always like becker.  but they got rid of bob in this season and it completely ruined the vibe of the show.  Plus becker starts to be nicer.  no, no, no.  hes rude and opinionated,  that's why the show was different. the decline was already started in season five when reggie left.  she wasn't as integral as bob, but a new character was introduced and that usually spells disaster.",1436400000,6,385,4.507246376811594

6728837,2,B00O83UNZM,"I can understand why this season was the last one.  While John Becker himself is still funny, the rest of the cast falls short, most notably the newest member.  This young ""comedian"" (and I don't know his name) was not funny and did not add anything to the show.  We sure miss Reg.",1426809600,2,281,4.264150943396227

8682447,1,B00O83UNZM,"I truly, truly hate manufacture-on-demand DVDs. I was excited about getting the final season of ""Becker"" on a separate DVD set because of the notoriously-bad packaging that was used to market the series set (ruined the last DVD), then I notice Amazon is selling the set as a cheap burned DVD set?!  I get that it's cheaper for the company... but the discs are NOT virtually permanent like normal DVDs! They wear out over time, they are much, much more susceptible to damage from scratches... just like burned CDs!
