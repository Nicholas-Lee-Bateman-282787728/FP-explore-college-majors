2535146,5,B000EULJZ6,"I am so glad that this show is finally coming out on DVD.  It is one of the best shows on tv, yet it hardly ever gets any attention.  I love this show, and I have a feeling that many other people are starting to enjoy it just the way I did- by turning on the TV out of boredom for the same old shows, and the the curiosity of what NCIS is all about.  Watch this show one time and you will be HOOKED!!",1142380800,8,400,3.6823529411764704
2535147,5,B000EULJZ6,"this is a totally amazing tv show that deserves more attention

than it gets! While other long-gone shows have already come out

on dvd, this show has long-term potential with a great cast and

storylines and I just hope we don't have to wait for additional

seasons to come out on DVD as we had to wait just for season 1.",1142294400,9,322,4.229508196721311

The action and interactions with the cast are fabulous and the storylines keep you watching to see how the plot unfolds. I love the tension between Kate and Tony, Gibbs is just great and I wonder about his relationship with Abbie. This is the show to watch for drama, comedy and a great cast to watch

Skipped the ones we remembered but a few were ""new"" to us since we had not seen them before.  Overall a good series, (altho not fond of the Tony character, especially in the early seasons). Gibbs, Abby and Duckie make this series, IMO. Well worth the $ if you are a fan of NCIS.",1512950400,,398,4.102564102564102

2535278,5,B000EULJZ6,"Way back in the early spring of 2003, a pair of episodes entitled Ice Queen and Meltdown aired as part of the eighth season of  JAG: Judge Advocate General.  In those episodes, Leroy Jethro Gibbs, a Special Agent from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), along with  his team of field agents and forensics experts, begin investigating the murder of a Navy JAG lawyer named  Lieutenant Loren Singer.  Evidence quickly points to another JAG lawyer  Commander Harmon Rabb  as the main suspect

With that two-episode backdoor pilot, the long-running police procedural NCIS was born. The following September, a full season of 23 episodes debuted on CBS. At the time, who could have suspected that this was the beginning of something big  a series that has now lasted for thirteen seasons (and counting), has been named the most watched television show in the world, and has spun off two more highly successful series?

NCIS is inspired by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), an actual civilian-run law enforcement agency of the U.S. Navy. Originally entitled Navy NCIS"" (for its first season only), the show follows the investigations of  Special Agents Leroy Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon), Tony DiNozzo (Michael Weatherly) and Caitlin Todd (Sasha Alexander), as well as  Medical Examiner Donald (Ducky} Mallard (David McCallum) and forensics expert Abby Sciuto (Pauley Perrette). Probationary Agent Timothy McGee (Sean Murray) joined the team as a recurring character later in the season.

From the very first episode of Season 1, it is evident that NCIS is different from most other police procedurals. It tackles Navy and Marine Corps-related crimes committed in the Washington DC area and its surrounding communities. These are the toughest cases: murders, kidnappings, an assassination attempt on the President of the United States, espionage, and even a terrorist plot to infiltrate NCIS headquarters. There's plenty of humor, drama, and suspense in every episode, and every central character is interesting, likeable, flawed, heroic, and easy to empathize with.

Even now, thirteen years after I saw it for the first time, I still get tremendous enjoyment from watching NCIS Season 1. Theres not a bad episode to be found anywhere amongst the 23 episodes of this shows inaugural season. Most highly recommended.",1467504000,,2335,5.309782608695652
2535279,5,B000EULJZ6,The whole cast is such a great fit and they play off each other in very pleasing manners.  I loved that they made Abby a goth and yet have her in an important and scientific role.  She inspired so many little girls that scientists CAN come in different shapes/sizes.  I highly recommend this show,1467244800,,296,4.444444444444445

I watched SWAK the other day and man was this show amazing in its prime. Its a real shame that the later seasons don't hold up like the earlier ones do. I honestly wonder if Shane Brennon hadn't stepped down if the show wouldn't have taken the worst nosedive imaginable. Because starting with Season 7 and onward, the show just isn't the same.",1461974400,,452,4.392857142857143

2535308,5,B000EULJZ6,"This show was about to have its 300th episode (13th Season) before I ever watched an episode, Season One.  The TV Guide story is what caused me to finally watch Season One, which I had owned for more than a year.  What a surprise to see what a great show I had been missing. Simply fantastic writing every show, great acting and directing.  Because of how low-priced the early seasons of this show are, I was able to buy at a reasonable price, and I am now just about finished with Season Nine of binge watching Seasons One through Nine, with Season Ten in the wings.  It does not get boring, Each episode is significantly different, and usually very funny, while remaining a serious crime-solving drama.  The entire series, so far, is highly recommended, but I would definitely recommend starting at the beginning, because, while most episodes are stand-alone shows, with an occasional two-part story, there is an overriding history and evolution of the characters that you would likely want to see in order, from the start.  I even bought JAG Season 8 to get the first appearance of the NCIS group.  This series is well-worth buying on DVD.",1461369600,,1142,4.708542713567839

2535409,5,B000EULJZ6,"NCIS Season One opens with the incident of a navy commander mysteriously dying on Air Force One.  There ends up at first being an initial struggle between the Secret Service, FBI, and the NCIS over who is meant to be assigned to the case. The crazy part is that the navy commander had unexpectedly died after  eating a rib meal where he was invited by the president (no the president did not do it). Anyhow, NCIS Season one is great for anyone who enjoys watching military themed television shows.",1446681600,,497,4.573033707865169

While the show is just fine, the DVD does NOT contain the promised ""Closed Captions."" This is the one and only reason for the single star. Amazon should let its buyers know when a DVD does not contain a relied-upon and/or promised feature. No ""Closed Captions"" is the reason, I'm reasonably certain, for the extremely low price!

Da Vinci episodes are intriguing mysteries loaded with subtle twists and turns whereas NCIS is a highly contrived diversion riddled with loud music, cliche characters, cardboard acting and implausible quick solutions.

Canadians also manage to solve crimes with fewer guns and and less violence.",1434412800,,509,4.839080459770115

2535696,4,B000EULJZ6,"The writers make a world of a difference in the development of the plot and all other subsequent sub-plots that may become involved in the course of the performance of each episode. The choice of personnel that play the parts and how they have melded the characters in the dynamics of the dialogue presented. How they project not only the professional dynamics but also the personal. Even with the characters that have been written out the writers have done an excellent job in how they have handled the logistics of the dynamics as they have introduced new characters. For the four star rating, I still question as to what demographic that the Amazon editions are to be marketed to. These are not family friendly for there are F-Bombs and other vocabulary that are not child friendly. Even a PG-13 rating is an inadequate caution.",1422921600,,831,4.777777777777778
2535697,4,B000EULJZ6,"Love the series, but knocked off a star due to editing issues with the Amazon Video version (I do not know if it's version specific or also is found on the Blue Ray edition).  The editing problem leads to spoilers in some cases.  The end of each scene, when the show would cut to commercial on TV, shows us the scene going to black and white.  The problem is that the black and white cut scenes are improperly dispersed within the Amazon Video series.  For example, the first scene opens by showing you the cut scene from the end, so many times we've seen the murder scene before seeing the runup to it.  It doesn't really ruin the show, but it happens often and we're up to season 4 and it's still ocurring.",1422835200,,708,4.293233082706767

I guess it is possible that all women in and related to anything military demonstrate overly emotional behavior and are limited in intelligence - but I highly doubt it.  I wish someone would have written this review before I purchased this show, but I should have surmised  that there would be male supremacist writing from the one star review about the gay man committing suicide.  It has the feel of the cop shows in the 80s where there is always a crazy emotional woman in distress and the over-acting, white male coming to save them.  That white male always knows what to say to calm them down because they are the level-headed, educated one. Ick, I need to shower.",1415318400,,716,4.606299212598425

2535821,1,B000EULJZ6,"The Weak Link title should be, the Homosexual Navy Seal team officer who must commit suicide. This Navy seal team officer is so boxed in by his religions teaching about homosexuality, i.e. the Roman Catholic Church, the military standard in May 2004 against open and avowed homosexuals being allowed to be in the military, his families tradition of military service and finally his wife confronting him with her discovery of his homosexuality and telling him he must choose her or his homosexuality; he decides he must kill himself and make his suicide appear to be a training accident that resulted in his death.  The moral of the story is if the Roman Catholic Church did not have their teaching about homosexuality, if his extended family would be tolerant of his homosexuality, if the military did not have some standard against homosexuals not being allowed to be completely open and proud of their homosexuality and if his wife would have been tolerant of his homosexuality and still married to her for their heterosexuality, then he would not have killed himself and he and everyone would have lived happily ever after.

I just realized after writing the last statement, I may be wrong about the Navy Seal Team officer being a homosexual.  This show might actually be about a bi-sexual guy who likes to do it with the men and women.  So all the above statements should be changed from homosexual to the bi-sexual guy who must commit suicide because the bi-sexual guy feels boxed in.

I know NCIS goes on for many more years after this episode and easily presume for many more years from this year.  The show producers could easily have a another show about the Navy Seal team officer believing he is boxed in by his church's teaching, any military standard, his familys military tradition and his wifes statement that she told her husband he had to make a choose between her or this time his bi-sexual polygamy life with multiple married partners.  And in that future show like this show, everyone will look and feel sad at the end of the show because of the un-necessary tragedy that this fine Naval officer believed he had to kill himself.  The Catholic priest or some pastor or minister of some church will have a similar final epitaph to the story as in this show.  The priest or minister will state he knew about the bi-sexual, polygamous Naval officers life that had to be kept a secret, but the religious guy had to just show love and concern in spite of his churchs doctrine and believe he failed this bi-sexual guy.  This future show can end again with the pretty, female, NCIS officer will just give a big smile to the priest or minister and replies, I have faith.  This statement made no sense to me.

The whole show is extremely improvable and not rational in the end.  In real life, very few if any adulterers will kill themselves and the few that do kill themselves, I do not believe there has ever been a case in which the adulterer tried to stage his own death to look like, seem like, faked like an accident.  And what makes the whole show even more improbable is to present a story that the must have to, suicide was because of religious, social and military standards and a spouse who demanded faithfulness.

Therefore I get the strong sense the show is really propaganda for the new morality.

NCIS goes for many more seasons beyond this show.  This show #22 is from the first season.  But, so far the characters are the same with a crime scene investigation just in a military a setting.  I think when there seems to be a political agenda based on an extremely improbable scenario I have been cured of watching anymore of NCIS.  That is unfortunate, maybe only for me.  I just do not like the new politics and sexual ethics being stuffed down my throat in entertainment when the motif is not related, that is a crime investigation in the Navy.

Therefore, I think I have been cured of paying for and watching anymore of NCIS even though I have only viewed the first 22 shows of season 1.",1413849600,,4015,4.609550561797753

2535875,5,B000EULJZ6,"Best thing about this Prime Instant Video is that it features subtitles. Seasons 1 - 5 of NCIS DVDs do not have subtitles. Beginning with season 6, somebody remembered that significant population of hearing impaired-to-deaf struggle to understand who did what? why? and when?. The how? was all that we could understand. Having praised Amazon for using the Paramount-CBS-provided subtitles for the Amazon videos only (and not issuing new packages of DVDs with same subtitles), I must also remind users that the entire season of Instant Videos of  Series 1 costs just under $20.00 and remains in your Video Library for as long as you subscribe to Prime. So, if Amazon continues with Series' 2-5, the total outlay would be $100. A steep price for limited income persona. I'm searching now for early NCIS series DVDs produced/offered in the Netherlands, a country that offers multi-multiple foreign language subtitles as well as subitles in English on English-language imports. My DVD library is chocked full on USA and British DVD packages from the Netherlands with English subtitles that were/are unavailable in the USA and England.",1409184000,3,1130,5.174863387978142

2535918,2,B000EULJZ6,"I'd never seen a CSI serial before purchasing this set, and wanted to see what all the hoopla was about. Unfortunately NCIS isn't free yet on Amazon Prime, so I purchased the DVD set (at < $20, I'm willing to take a chance). I chose NCIS as my introduction to the CSI franchise because Pauley Perrette's character seemed to have potential in providing ongoing appeal (a goth on network TV who isn't portrayed as a reject dunce? that's refreshing...)

PROs
+ the acting by Mark Harmon and Sasha Alexander is convincing
+ Pauley Perrette's character is enticing and adds flavor to an otherwise bland serial (Ducky helps too)
+ the austere character Gibbs is balanced out by the less jaded attitudes of the other protagonists
+ exposure to bits of Navy/ Marine Corps culture (assuming that there is some degree of realism to the program) helps to keep the show from being too boring
+ um... having trouble coming up with other pros... I like the music during the opening credits?

CONs
- Abby Sciuto is not a believable character, despite her glowing presence that steals the show. She would have about five PhDs to do her job as portrayed. ""Oh Gibbs, I can figure that out! I did one of my dissertations on different types of pine bark!"" I know people who work in white jackets in labs, and while they may be quite intelligent, they are not a Jack or Master of all sciences. Plus, while I like that NCIS is trying to portray a goth as capable and brainy, Abby is still a Hollywoodized version of a goth. But thanks for trying.

- Gibbs walks around with a big stick up his you-know-what. Makes me wonder if Mark Harmon is like that IRL. I suppose it could be an effective trait for a lead investigator, but it's difficult to enjoy a serial in which the central character is off-putting.

- I know this first season was aired only 2 years after 9/11, but really do we need a terrorist hiding under everyone's bed in every other episode? If there were as many terrorists in the U.S. as portrayed in this series, you wouldn't be able to go to the grocery store without brushing up against one.

- Plot holes galore. I don't need to go into detail here since the 2-star review by C. Franz covers some of the blunders in NCIS season 1.

- Something almost unbearable about Michael Weatherly's character Anthony DiNozzo, can't quite put my finger on it. Maybe he was funny 10 years ago or something.

- The humor falls flat too often. I think this is partly because television has improved since 2003, but that may be giving NCIS too much credit. The back and forth between DiNozzo and Caitlin is already wearing thin by the end of the season. The trite dismissal of Ducky (whenever he speaks more than 3 sentences about something interesting) is predictable to the point of being annoying.

Final verdict: This seems like a serial from the 1990s rather than the 21st century. I find the show ideal for falling asleep to at night because I don't much care if I make it to the end of an episode. So much for my experiment with CSI...",1401062400,,3024,4.495446265938069

Little nuances become evident and obvious by watching the series in sequence that is missed through a hit and miss watching regimen.

When NCIS came along I said ""I'm not watching that A hole"".  The everyone kept telling me how much fun it was and how I was missing it.  I got the first couple seasons on sale and decided to give it a shot.  All is forgiven Mark.  The show is smart, funny and fresh every time.  they do not go too far on gore or violence and they always look good, even in a prison camp which is not easy.  Maybe he has mellowed with age, I have .  But it is probably the acting.  You can start with any season and still enjoy but I suggest begining at the begining.",1373932800,,697,3.8111888111888113

That says the series manages to please the majority of people by providing good stories and characters we can identify with.
Season one is the introduction to this long-running show.  You meet the foundation characters that carry this series.
The first show, ""Yankee White"", sets the standard for acting and writing that we know and love.
While not a ""pivotal season"", it is enjoyable and fun.

Yes, we have seen some of them but now we can follow the story.",1371686400,,570,4.643564356435643

2536117,4,B000EULJZ6,"I actually do love NCIS, watch it every week, but what was interesting with the first season was watching the personal dynamic between the characters and realizing how much it has evolved over the years.  It was very different from what I thought I remembered.  The actors characters were more overblown....The characters are still along the same line but much more subtle now and for me more enjoyable which was why it didn't have five stars.  It was fun to see how Magee was woven into the series and not so much fun knowing Kate was going to get shot.

It definitely is worth owning to see how the series has evolved AND the stories are just a interesting and good as they now are.  You find out how various armed forces procedure work i.e. on Airforce One and yes I had to do a double take when the actor who played George W. Bush came aboard...he really looked like Bush!  Watching them takeoff and land on the destroyer and finding out about the procedures for those sitting in seats, interesting wouldn't have realized that.

He does not respect personal boundaries, going so far as to rifle through his colleagues' possessions, both at work and in their homes, and listen in on private phone calls. The targets of this behavior are either victims of Tony's quests for new sources of amusement, the behavior has improved some over the past seasons but not enough.

The best part about the show is the interaction between the regular (and irregular) characters. Over the years the show has changed. Sometimes the change was due to the death of a character (and there have been several of those. Sometimes it has been due to a person from a characters past being introduced (like Tony's dad).

The writting is sharp and the acting is very good. Nearly all of the medical stuff is true as well (being a pharmacist I can vouch for that). Directing and camera work is interesting as well.

There are very few 'bad' episodes. I would rate this show a very solid 8 to 8.5 out of 10.",1368921600,,807,4.296052631578948

From the start Mark Harmon was an excellent choice as the lead along with the rest of the cast.  Aside from Sasha Alexander's character who only lasted for two seasons, the rest of the cast develops into the tight knit group of supporting actors that add to the storyline instead of the fits and starts that other shows seem to suffer from.",1367625600,,492,4.51685393258427

I think that all of the characters that have been chosen for this show work so well together and they are also very entertaining.  I love watching Abby work in her lab.  She has funny little quirks about herself.  I also enjoy watching Gibbs run his team time and time again.  He is the type of boss that I wish I could have in life.  They are like a small united family who would do anything for one another.  Last night, I had watched the episode in season ten and they prove that they would do anything for one another.  If anyone is into a crime show, I would highly recommend this show to you.  It did not take me long to get hooked onto it.  The crimes are always different from the last one.

2536225,4,B000EULJZ6,"The pilot episode introduces the NCIS cast as the come into conflict with other agencies over jurisdiction in a death of a naval officer on Air Force One. They win, of course, by subterfuge and friends in the right places.  Ducky's digressions, Abbie's jumping up and down, and DiNozzo's sexism and movie references come into play right away and will scarcely change over the decade to follow. Gibbs, too, is exactly the same: boat, gut, and all. It's a convoluted plot, but fun. The George Bush character is amazingly well done. The only reasons I don't give it five stars is that Abbie's look has not come together at all in the pilot--her hair is a mess--and the lack of McGee is glaring. I could see why McGee had to be added: to make DiNozzo an equal-opportunity oppressor! This episode is a great beginning to a well-loved series.",1359849600,,836,4.648648648648648

Was a little bummed that I could nopt find out what the episodes were on Amazon, before purchasing them. I would have skipped buying Season 1, cause I have watched on DVR, most episodes of each season probably half a dozen times, trying to record episodes that does not sound familiar in the caption, but when I watch them I realize I've seen them in the first minute of the show starting. Some I have definitly watch quite a few times, there are definitly hysterical episodes. I LOVED the ending in Christmas 2009 episode where Tony is all serious to the end, and everyone is puzzled & in the end, Ziva & McGee sit down at their desks and confetti pops out all over and scares them, I died laughing!!

2536242,5,B000EULJZ6,"This is the one that started it all. Every time I go back and watch the seasons in order, I never cease to be amazed at the superb quality of season one. This show did not have to find itself or seek out a niche. It hit the ground running and never looked back.

The first couple of seasons slowly developed a faithful viewing audience, and by year three, the show was becoming a big deal. This set will show you why NCIS is still the number one drama on television!

I recommend this to people who love police shows, to people who like a slightly quirky cast, to military personnel, especially Navy and Marines. I would recommend this to anyone who loves a great ensemble cast with a strong lead.

There truly is something for everyone.",1356566400,,737,4.364963503649635

2536263,4,B000EULJZ6,"NCIS is not perfect.  I enjoy the earlier seasons because I found the characters less formulated and predictable as they are now.  The earlier season's stories were well written, maybe not as strong as the original CSI, but much better than CSI: Miami.  And while the Law and Order and NYPD Blue were better investigator shows, NCIS  in the early seasons moved a good pace and had interesting characters.  While I still like the show, I think it was stronger in the beginning because it was more plot based than character based now (although I do profess my love to Cote De Pablo  LOL) .  Its a great add to any collection if you like this genre.",1356220800,,646,4.47008547008547

The stories and situations and the facts (Ducky's as well as Abby's) are always a high point for me.  My husband is now addicted and has watched the first two seasons at least twice through each.  My only problem with the DVDs is that there is no closed captioning, so that my husband can follow the dialogue easier (he's hard of hearing).

Sasha Alexandra as Kate, Weatherly as Tony Dinnozo, And no Jimmy Palmer didn't make an appearance until the end of this season. Season one has a solid opening, you can tell they knew what they wanted to be. The pilot gives us a shoot-out on airforce one, with Kate resigning from the secret service. Only to have Gibbs give her a job at NCIS, the season just kind of goes along until we get to Bete Noire. And Ari, who infiltrates NCIS. Shoots Gerald, Ducky's first assistant in the shoulder. And takes Ducky, Kate and Gerald hostage. Gibbs tries to kill him, only to find out he's a double agent for the FBI. And then the obsession begins, where Gibbs wants to kill this guy. Mcgee does make an appearance, but it's towards the end of the season, all in all, season one is solid.

2536360,4,B000EULJZ6,"While the writing in particular is superb for this series, along with equally great acting and filmmaking, delivering characters who from the start are well-drawn and possessed of depth beyond the thickness of the screen, the DVD set of the first season is lacking in some regions.

Given that someone interested in purchasing the set is already surely a fan of the show, I will not go any further in my praise of the cast and creators. However, there is only one episode (the Pilot) which has a commentary. While it is provided by the show's creator, Donald Bellisario, there are a number of great episodes in this season which I would find a commentary suitable. There are three short special features on the sixth disc, mainly dealing with the process of casting the characters and developing the show. Another significant flaw in my opinion is the lack of subtitles. The description of the set here on Amazon notes that the discs are subtitled, but this is not the case (neither the setup menu nor the subtitle button for my player gives the option). Also, to watch the episodes, you have to select each episode on the disc individually; there is no ""play all"" feature. I like to see the menu once only until I've seen the entirety of the shows on the disc.

Still, the menus are not overdone with annoying transitions between screens like some movies and shows use, and the quality of the video is at least as good as the original broadcasts. I recommend the set for those who are fans of the show, but for those with hearing difficulties who want subtitles, this set won't suffice.",1270944000,3,1587,4.644128113879003

2536380,2,B000EULJZ6,"(Note: this review only covers the first season, as I currently only own that. Please be advised that reviews are very subjective, and this one seemingly runs against the majority)

Allow me to begin this review by stating that I am in no way a fan of ""CSI"" series, which appears to be the inspiration for NCIS. But I have watched - and enjoyed - CSI for few years so I feel comfortable drawing comparisons (I've also watched a few episodes of JAG, but never liked that so I won't compare it to the other alleged alma mater).

NCIS is a series about criminal investigators, employed by the Navy. It draws heavily on the aforementioned CSI theme (""follow the evidence""), albeit with much larger holes in the plot and other 'features' that sadly diminish the whole.

Now, CSI is a series where the viewer is regularly expected to suspend disbelief (just how many more of these dorky ""can you enhance that image"" scenes must we endure? You know the one - where the computer miraculously resolves a brown-green pixel into the Mona Lisa), which is sometimes annoying, but standard for most entertainment TV. But in NCIS it gets to a point where it becomes really, really hard to ignore reality and feel somewhat insulted by what the writers expect you to accept:

Examples from just the first four episodes (I saw the whole first season):
- During the Pilot, NCIS 'hijacks' Air Force One, *and* smuggles a body off the plane; they then go up against the *active* head of the President's security detail and win. If that is not enough: while doing so, they discover a terrorist plot based (I'm not joking here) on the movie 'Air Force One'.

- In the episode 'Seadog' NCIS not only miraculously (because there is no evidence to support this) deducts that instead of a drug deal, another terrorist plot is afoot. They find out that the main suspect is a victim (OK), and the victim has nothing to do with the main story (hmmmm). It gets worse: NCIS also deduct (from a Google search) that the whole of USA is dependent on three (3) power masts that are all conveniently located in Virginia, and they manage to catch the terrorist (singular) trying to sabotage them at the correct mast (if you follow the ridiculous plot he could have been at any of the three).

- in 'hung out...' they force an admission of guilt by threatening the life of the suspect (and you can forget about reading him his rights). This, by the way even though they *have* hard evidence in the form of DNA.

- let us forget the abominable 'the Immortals' episode where the writers manage to get everything wrong - only to serve up a wafer thin story about insanity. It takes place aboard a destroyer but could have happened anywhere where people have PCs (evidently the writers think that US warships are run by top-of-the line PCs configured to play MMORPGs). This was one so bad I constantly hoped it was a joke episode - or a dream.

- In 'the Curse' (number 5, but we skipped 'Immortals') NCIS rush a case to confront a suspect with incomplete and fabricated evidence instead of waiting for the data. While not laboring under any deadline (to be precise, the case is already a decade old). They do the exact opposite of following the evidence.

What's worse is that in NCIS the investigators often do not follow the evidence, but a hunch. A hunch, by the way, that is in no way supported or even indicated by any evidence:
- The poisoning of the 'Football' carrying aide to the president is in reality a terrorist plot to force the president into a certain kind of action. No evidence for this.
- The 'can you enhance that image' clue found on a getaway car (the logo of a power company) leads the investigators to look up, find, and somehow verify a specific document on the internet that would allow foreign terrorists to take down the whole USA. Yeah.

But plot holes and fantasy science aside, there are more problems with this series:

- Almost everything feels second-rate - actors, image quality, color fidelity (watch CSI, West Wing, Brothers & Sisters or even FireFly to see how it's done right) - everything looks cheap or cobbled together. The lab tech is (what the studio thinks is) a Goth chick, ostensibly to please the geek crowd (even though I have the feeling that the studio managed to irrecoverably alienate them with 'Immortals'). Instead of CG the studio uses second-rate video games and animation software. Heck, they even use corny complimentary (or public) footage from military vessels and planes, just like many old ""B"" monster movies.

- The whole series is doused in cringe-inducing, and what only can be charitably called 'W Bush era ""Patriotism""': Normal Law Enforcement Officers are fat idiots that get in the way. 7-year old kids should salute their father's casket on his funeral (meant as an advice for solace). Ugh. Terrorists are everywhere. Interestingly, and I hope that this is pure coincidence, the only 'dirty' naval officers in the first segment are an ex-con, and (uh, oh) one of the first enlisted women aboard a Navy Vessel. The one 'untainted' Navy suspect turns out to be a hero.

Are there any upsides to NCIS? There are, and they are somewhat far in-between. Acting is fair, in some instances even good (sadly usually from a guest star). The investigators follow a more low-tech approach, which I found refreshing. And, it would have been great if the investigators would follow the evidence. Alas, they regularly do the opposite, low tech evidence be damned.

All in all I am somewhat surprised that I'm the only one who is disappointed by NCIS. To me it simply feels like a clich&eacute;d, dumbed down, cheap version of CSI that somehow manages to get the one thing wrong that kept CSI watchable. To be honest, I had expected more from this series. Seeing that this review is at odds with that of everyone else I must assume that I was simply expecting something different.",1258070400,14,5893,4.670202507232402

Forget that Mark Harmon is beyond scrumptious or that Pauley Perette is just this side of kookie that makes her incredibly likeable. Forget that there's hot extras in pretty much every episode.

It's like these characters were built around the the actors, or for the actors anyway. This box set was the beginning for me When I got it I was excited I was ready to get the rest of them.

2536427,5,B000EULJZ6,"NCIS is one of the most addictive on TV--period! Each actor is well-suited to his/her role and does a more-than-excellent job portraying their character. Each character has depth and plays well off their counterpart. Case in point is Tony DiNozzo vs. Kate Todd--the writers really captured DiNozzo's Italian cultural idiosyncrasies: outgoing, price as a value system, constant snooping, and male machismo--""The Babe Hound"". All these together ARE Tony DiNozzo. You'll also enjoy the brother-sister relationship he has with the reserved Kate Todd, ex-body guard to the President of the United States, and winner of a wet T-shirt contest during her college days. DiNozzo also plays off Tim McGee aka ""McGeek"", who, as time progresses, learns to overcome Tony's ""charisma"", especially after his book-""loosely based on the team""-is published.

Now it only makes sense that Abby and McGee team up, the former a field forensics scientist, the latter an MIT computer forensics specialist. The Goth vs Geek attraction is also a nice touch, one hinting at a future romance.

The last pair of ""opposites"" are Gibbs and ""Ducky""--Dr. Mallard. Gibbs,a highly decorated ex-Marine and winner of the Silver Star, is focused, driven, a ""non-techi"", whose painful history includes a murdered wife and daughter, two failed marriages, and a tour of duty in Iraq where he was awarded the Purple Heart. ""Ducky"", on the other hand, revels in history, almost to the point of distraction. He is amiable, concerned with relationships--so much so, that he talks to his dead patients.

The only part of the show I find over-exaggerated is the phenomenal amounts of caffeine consumed by Gibbs and Abby. Any normal person would self-destruct. LOL.",1230681600,2,1717,5.259124087591241

2536445,5,B000EULJZ6,"On televison, there are dozens of crime dramas. While none of them have the long-standing history of Law & Order, or the popularity of CSI, I've found that NCIS is one that has always managed to keep my interest and been much more enjoyable to watch. To this day, NCIS is the only crime drama I watch and TV, and I've never felt compelled to watch anything else in the genre.

I've watched quite a bit of L&O, and sat through a few episodes of CSI, but I've found them both boring, and at times, can really drag you down with the gritty realism, the dark crimes and hard lessons learned. It's why I don't often watch these shows; they get rather depressing. Don't make the mistake of thinking NCIS lacks these things. A horrible crime has taken place, and you can bet money it's going to be resolved, and rarely does the perp go unpunished. As the leading man, Mark Harmon as Gibbs is great. Gibbs isn't a nice guy, but he's 100% behind his team and is the best at what he does. When he assures a victim's family he's going to get justice, you can believe it's not false hope.

Gibbs is just one example of the unique characters who blend the serious with the little things that give you a chuckle. Don't think that just because a character like Tony comes off as brash, immature, and a little girl crazy that he's not going to take his job seriously. A few lines of witty banter and the occasional smack on the back of the head doesn't detract from a serious story line. Rather it helps the viewer ""bond"" with this unique team. Kate Todd, played by Sasha Alexander, can be sympathetic to a victim and courageous in the face of a dangerous opponent. As the new member of the team, she's a great way to help a viewer settle into this new way of investigating crimes.

Another favorite character is Abby, the ""resident goth chick"" and forensics expert. Although Abby is a goth, it's nice to see she breaks the stereotype of the emo, depressed, obsessed with death goth. She's actually very bubbly and friendly, and I would certainly take the chance to throw on some black nail polish and platform boots to hang out with her in her scene for a night.

While you may run into the normal run of murders and mysterious crimes that make up the bulk of crime drams, investigations are anything but ordinary. This first season takes viewers to a variety of locations, including on a submarine and an aircraft carrier to investigate crimes. While all crimes do involve military personnel, there are various twists and turns, and I enjoy trying to go through an episode figuring out the ""whodunnit"" part.

With a fun cast of dynamic characters to enjoy, NCIS has more to offer than your average crime drama.",1216857600,2,2696,4.493877551020408
2536446,5,B000EULJZ6,"I came to this series in Season 3.  I bought Season 1 to see how it all started.

The first episode shows Kate in her job as a Secret Service Agent on Airforce One.  During the episode, Gibbs makes a couple of references to the movie with Harrison Ford.  (Yes, Gibbs, not D'nozo.)

McGee isn't yet a member of the team.  He appears as a guest in a few episodes.  Did you know McGee and Abby had a relationship?  Now, I know why Abby's toothbrush was at McGee's in Season 3.

The first slap to the back of the head happens half way through the season.  And the calf-poww!  (I like to watch this show with a SuperBigGulp.)

Kate's character grew on me, it makes me sadder, now, when I watch Season 3.  When she picks on D'nozo, he puts on a wounded puppy look.

Ducky and Jared are regular characters.  This season doesn't include Ziva Daveed or Director Shepard, not even as an off screen reference.  But, it does show how the whole 'Ari' subplot developed.

There is one goofy thing that happens to my DVD set, Disks 3, 4, and 5:

When I press play for the first episode on the disk, for some reason, it plays the last episode on the disk.  To get the first episode to play, I start the second episode, and then as soon as it starts, I press Search previous twice.  Disks 1, 2, and 6 don't have this weirdness.

It was enjoyable to see how the NCIS eccentricities developed into giving this show it's unique character.

This show has also taught me a new respect for US Marines and Navy.  I can't help but wonder how truly it represents real life in the services.",1213660800,,1563,4.2593856655290105

2536463,5,B000EULJZ6,"I am not a big TV watcher, and I really hate most of the crime procedurals on TV (Can't stand CSI and it's spinoffs or Law and Order since Lenny died).  Also, as a former Marine, I, along with many Marines I know hated JAG.  The ""I'm a lawyer, and a fighter pilot"" thing never sat well with me, nor did the female Marine lawyer Major/Colonel who went out on ""behind the lines"" recon missions.  I thought it was a lot of crap. Therefore, when I heard about NCIS ""From the creator of JAG"" AND ""From the network that brought you CSI"", I quickly passed on the show.  However, I met my girlfriend (later, wife) in college, and she loved the show.  I was visiting her one night, and she made me watch it.  I thought it was GREAT.  I wound up illegally downloading all the back episodes to catch up.  Then came the DVD.  I bought it very quickly, and liked watching the (slightly) higher quality DVD collection.  My one and only beef isn't with the show, but with the fact that since the collection came out so much later than show was on, I was expecting more and better special features, and a better quality DVD.  That is my only complaint.",1186876800,3,1136,4.286384976525822

2536465,5,B000EULJZ6,"Here's why NCIS is such a great show- as far as I know, it's the only show currently on television that is able to take a serious situation, combine it with humor, and make the story believable.  I believe that's the shows strongest point.  When watching an episode of this show, you care about the story, but at the same time you are able to care about Abby, Ducky and Tony because they provide distinct and enjoyable personalities and laughs.

It's really cool in my opinion how the show is able to throw in some humor during a dangerous and critical situation the team might be going through, and have it all come across as, maybe not ""realistic"", but certainly more believable and interesting compared to other shows who try to do the same thing.  NCIS has really solid writing.

The second greatest thing about NCIS is the great variety of personalities.  You have Abby, who's more than just a crazy gothic chick, she's also extremely smart and alert.  Every episode she finds a new way to amaze me with her overall fascinating weirdness.  She's STILL a really cool character right now, during Season 4.  You have the boss (named Gibbs) who's very demanding and always finds a way to get STRAIGHT to the point and immediately stop ANY humorous conversations that he happens to be overhearing from his workmates.  He's exactly what you'd expect from a boss.

Tony is the guy who's supposedly a ladies man, and insists he can have any woman he wants (though he's starting to change and grow up in Season Four).  Ducky is the guy who examines dead peoples bodies, and he's always hilarious in a sort of mean-spirited way.  He talks to the bodies while he's examining them.  He's a really good character.  Many other characters on the show are memorable, also.  In fact, they all are.

The point of the show is for these crime investigators to get together and find out how people have died, and it's great because when the show gets serious, and the characters gather all the clues they have at the moment and put the pieces together, you really get into the story.  At the same time, the genius writing team also implements humor during these parts, usually at the end of a scene before the next one comes in.  It's actually funny.  The show is serious AND funny and it *works*.

How many crime investigation shows have you seen that can pull off seriousness *just* as well as humor?  Probably none.  That's what makes NCIS such a good show.  I hope it sticks around for years.  Pick up Season One to find out where it all began.",1176163200,3,2532,4.560975609756097
2536466,5,B000EULJZ6,"I have to admit I got hooked on this show a little while ago, but had only seen 1 episode first hand from this specific season. I thought it was great, there's so many episodes for it being the first season, because I've bought other shows on DVD and the last one I got there were only 6 episodes...this one has 23 episodes in all, and I love the behind the scenes stuff they throw in too.

There were a few episodes I liked in particular in this season because they didn't follow the usual story line, and really kept you guessing or they had a cool twist to them.

The characters are great, and I love the visuals in this show. It's all very well thought out.",1174521600,4,661,4.15625
2536467,5,B000EULJZ6,"I'm a fan of cop shows, and one of my favorites, growing up, was Tom Selleck in Magnum P.I. I never was able to follow the popularity of Don Bellisario's later series JAG (I think because my admiration for the military wasn't able to overcome my disdain for lawyers in general) but I am intrigued by the show that spun off from JAG, NCIS. The Naval Criminal Investigative Service is a sort of Navy detective agency which supplements the Shore Patrol to investigate criminal activity that involves Naval personnel.

Mark Harmon starts as Jethro Gibbs, an ex-Marine Gunnery Sergeant who was a sniper, and has what you might call issues in dealing with others. His co-stars consist of a wiseacre (Michael Weatherly's Anthony Dinozzo) and a rather prim and proper female (Sasha Alexander's Kate Todd). His detectives are supplemented by a forensic specialist played by an ex-model named Pauley Perrette, one of the more innovative and well-acted characters in current television, and a coroner portrayed by the inimitable and seemingly ageless David McCallum.

I continue to enjoy this series, and the first season was very very fun at times. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys detective shows.",1173744000,3,1197,5.010050251256281

2536470,3,B000EULJZ6,"NCIS is in the same tradition as CSI, but does not quite reach the heights the various CSI franchises were able to achieve.  The stories are usually interesting, but the characters are simply not that engaging.  The acting is fairly solid, as is the writing from a dramatic arc standpoint-- the dialogue however, leaves much to be desired.  To say that clichs abound is, well, clich, but there it is.  More often it descends to blandness, making it hard to be interested in what the various characters have to say.  It is also rather difficult to buy Mark Harmon as a hard-bitten Marine; no matter how hard he tries, he comes across as threateningly as a favorite Uncle.  David McCallum (Dr Drake, aka, ""Ducky"") is  delightful. Tony DiNozzo, played by actor Michael Weatherly, is mostly annoying and at times, detestable.
The show's creators proudly proclaim the interpersonal relationships of the characters as the show's strength, when actually, it is the show's greatest weakness.  Interesting stories are often bogged down while characters fret over each other's feelings and motivations and stall to sort out their emotions.

Leroy Jethro Gibbs [has always been a heartthrob] but three wives [let's see, the first one with daughter was murdered?]what happened to the other two.  It turns out - eventually - that he had an affair with the, now director, and former partner?

Abbs is the ultimate in strange but likable genius - her and Agent Tim McGee - they are very neat counterpoints to each other.

Dr. Donald ""Ducky"" Mallard turns out to be another brilliant doctor who has had enough experience over the years [and friendship with Jethro] to invariably come up with all the right answers.

Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo comes across with a deep admiration of his boss and yet still wants approval.  Is he hiding a bit of emotional insecurity?

I was especially upset when Harmon was killed off in the West Wing [must be he was becoming a threat] but elated when NCIS showed up with him in the lead.

By the way, what happened to the red-head that would pick him up at the end of the show?  And how did he get that boat out of his basement?

2536473,5,B000EULJZ6,"This is a must-see TV show for me. I love it! The cast is great and the way they interact with each other is just the best. They mix clinical investigation with comedy and I think it is a perfect fit.

I particularly like Pauley Perrette as the quirky Abby. She is a real delight to see each week. Mark Harmon makes a great lead and I was very upset when last season (early 2006), it looked like he was leaving the show (or being kicked off because he was too old?). In this season, Sasha Alexander is the lead female investigator and she did an outstanding job. However, I can't say enough good things about Cote de Pablo who took her place.

Then there is Ilia Kuriakin! David McCallum is an all time favorite and I love what he has done with Ducky. Then there is Michael Weatherly who is so full of movie references, he almost sounds like me. Finally, we have Sean Murray who shows up late in the season, I think. He plays Probie so well, I could almost believe he is really like that!

This season's set is a great introduction to the show and displays how the characters develop up to what they are now in 2007.

The CSI franchise is heavily process driven franchise which combines highly stylized visuals of cast members completing labwork to unravel the mystery against the background of new age (or similar) music. However, NCIS is not just a CSI clone using a military setting. The key to this show is the great interplay between cast members with particular emphasis on comic relief.

Having spent an entire career in business, I can attest to the fact that the cast members do relate to each other in a manner similar to the way real people who work together do. Interstingly, this is a series which (at least in an admittedly small sampling) is watched together by spouses.

Their top notch forensic scientist is a goth, their coroner is Dr. Donald Mallard, aka ""Duckie"".  And their mysteries are also solid and well acted. The episodes are definitely worth owning and watching again.  Admittedly, there are times having rewind helps a lot in this fast-paced series.",1161302400,3,434,5.1571428571428575
2536498,4,B000EULJZ6,"I thought I saw all of Season 1, but after looking through these discs, I realized that there were a few shows that I must have missed.  NCIS was first seen as a subset of characters on JAG for two episodes.  The characters had a much colder demeanor in JAG than in this dedicated show, where the audience can see the true colors of the NCIS team.

NCIS provides a wonderful blend of different shows, while still remaining unique in their specific law enforcement field.  NCIS has some close ties with JAG (also another Bellisario production), but it could not properly be described without mentioning that NCIS also appears to have parts of Nash Bridges (another CBS production, now only seen as reruns on USA) and CSI blended in as well.  The humor between  characters can most certainly be described to parallel JAG and Nash Bridges.  There is a unique bond to say the least between Special Agent Gibbs and his team members. Gibbs is stearn and strictly business when on the job while other members of his investigation team find humor playfully at each other's expence or even regarding Agent Gibbs.  However, Gibbs's stearn nature can also provide good entertainment for the audience as well.  The forensic aspects in each show do not go as deep as CSI, but there is some science behind the evidence.  It's not an uptight show that only shows the characters working to ""get their man.""  A believeable story with the provided humor makes for an enjoyable episode.

The DVDs work fine, the only problem is that they constantly startup in Spanish, which can throw you off each time you start an episode before",1156809600,7,1611,4.714285714285714

2536536,5,B000EULJZ6,"NCIS is not JAG (which it was spun off from) nor CSI (which is was compared to and on the same network) nor is it  Law and Order Criminal Intent (a show in a similar vein). Naval Criminal Investigative Service is a real life investigative agency, investigating miltary crimes connected to Navy . These show are not like Dragnet or the FBI , which use to take cases from these agencies.

Mark Harmon leads the team playing Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs with a cool aire in his step. With his second in command the con man-ish (think FACE from the A-Tean) Anthony Dinozzo (played by Dark Angel's Computer whiz Michael Weatherly-in a role more suited for his talents)  and ex secret service Agent Caitlin Todd (Sasha Alexander) (who joined in the first episode). Doing medical for the team is ""Ducky"" Mallard (played by the EX Man from UNCLE's David McCallum). With Goth princess /Forensic Specialist Abby Sciuto (Pauley Perrette)rounding the team, they take on the unique and bizarre cases, which seem to have a ring of truth in today's world

Their methods are sometimes unorthodox, but always effective. Interesting TV. It does intrigue, however the mystery draws you in. This 6 disk 23 episodes will NEVER bore you, I will say that!

The extra have documentaries. The first episode has some insightful commentary by writer/producer/director Donald Bellisario.

However  what is missing is the three part JAG episodes that introduced the NCIS program, which ran as part of the JAG series

Well maybe in season two of NCIS box set, just like Universal DVD did with The Rockford Files pilot, which it placed  on Season two box set of Rockford.

So is it worth it, It is good solid smart mysteries that with makes you think , with a likeable cast, Go get it!

Mark Harmon is the heart and soul of this show. I cannot imagine this show without Mark Harmon as Gibbs.

David McCallum, Michael Weatherby and Sasha Alexander are great too but the best is Pauley Perette, who plays Abby.  The is a special bond between Abby (Perette) and Gibbs (Harmon) that is great to watch.  The interplay between Ducky (McCallum) and Gibbs (Harmon) is great too.

Every character on the show is quirky, interesting and fully dimensional.  Pauley Perrette  is hysterically funny as lab tech Abby. Her character hooked me onto the show and Harmon and the rest of the team made me stay.

I would have given the boxset 5 stars if it were not for the subpar DVD format. There are no subtitles which I find to be a must. Also there are is no SCENE SELECTION!!! Without scene selection, I might as well be watching VHS. Once I got past these shortcomings, I still loved the show and the characters.

NCIS is a simple show: bad things happen to people on military land and the Navy Criminal Investigative Squad is sent out to find out who did it.  The crimes are par for the course; sometimes interesting, sometimes not.  There aren't any flaws in directing or production either, it's all at the quality that is to be expected from a network TV show.  Where NCIS falls apart is its character and comedy writing, which verges on stereotypical and uncomfortable.  All too often the show tries far too hard to be funny, creating an aura that makes the show hard to watch.  The characters are flawed by this same sense, because their interactions with each other usually force out this comedy, such as Gibbs constant thrashing of his underlings in his stereotypical ""you're an idiot"" way NCIS has worked to cringing perfection.  Unfortunately, this makes the show at times unbearable to watch, not to mention the fade-to-black-and-white stylistic which feels forced.

 Are you someone who likes drama shows? Particuarly crime drama  shows? If yes, continue on then.

 Are characters that are easy to fall in love with important to you? Are you a human that enjoys a good laugh? Do you cherish the sweet moments on television?And do you crave out-of-your-seat tension that will keep you up all night wondering what will happen in the next episode?

 If you said yes to all of these things, I guarantee that you will love this show!

 And here is my personal take on NCIS:

 I like crime dramas like CSI, Law and Order, JAG, and such. I also like thrillers like LOST. But I also like SpongeBob SquarePants.

 CSI is okay, but it doesn't really have the laughs that I like in a show.

 Law and Order is nice, but the relationships between the workers are too perfect.

 LOST is nice, but once again, no laughs, no 5+star ratings.

 NCIS has the wonderful combination of all of these show into one. It will leave you laughing, crying, or staying awake staring at the ceiling hating Dave Bellisaro.

 I won't go on about the characters, because there are about 6 reviews talking about them.

 I just wanted to give my take on this show. It is by far, my favorite show on the network.",1144368000,80,1292,4.358649789029536
2536564,5,B000EULJZ6,"I recently got hooked onto the series, and found myself studying it, and the history surrounding it.  While the characters were introduced on JAG, the term ""spin-off"" I didn't think appropriate for it.  For those who have seen many of the Bellisarius productions, they seem to swing between emphasis on interpersonal relationships (Magnum, Quantum Leap) and strongly patriotic vehicles (Airwolf, JAG), with the shows having the better developed characters being the stronger shows.

This is why--and Don Bellisario backs this up in interviews--NCIS seems to lean more towards Magnum in terms of of how the characters react towards one another, and the quirks that play out with them.  Mark Harmon's Gibbs--the lead investigator; doesn't work well with authority or other agencies (or his ex-wives), coffee-addicted, carving a boat in his basement, and known for his ""mysterious redhead"" companion.  Michael Weatherly's DiNozzo--the jock who won't grow up, making a pass at anything with a skirt.  Sasha Alexander's Kate--in an homage to ""Moonlighting"", becoming Maddie to DiNozzo's David; while being the mature and smarter part of that combination.  Sean Murray's Tim McGee--yeah, he's the computer nerd.  But women are seeing SOMETHING in him.  Especially Abby.  Which brings us to Pauley, Pauley, Pauley--Miss Perette takes our classic concept of a Goth chick and throws it out the window in a spectacular fashion, with her peppiness and her open attraction for the men in the office.  It is David McCallum though that really brings the Magnum memory into clear relief.  Think about John Hillerman's Jonathan Higgins on Magnum--know it all because he's seen it all.  Put him in a lab coat and give him more and lighter hair, and we have Ducky Mallard.

Clearly, NCIS isn't JAG, and it certainly isn't even close to being related to the CSI franchise.  There's a fun in the drama that plays out in every episode that leaves the viewer giggling while anticipating the action, and that's what makes the Season 1 set so entertaining.",1144108800,108,2032,5.17125382262997

NCIS is one of the best and clearly the most entertaining criminalistic TV shows of all times.

Its not only the great plots in each episodes with very surprising revelations. Its the magic of the characters being performed by great team of actors. I love the tension between Tonny and Kate, the coffee addiction of Gibson and Abby is simply charming with her pigtails and ruby red lips.

To begin with, everyone is an investigator first and foremost, and never once deviates from their job descriptions to do something completely improbable like Harmless Rabbit used to do, such as borrow an F-14 to go hunt terrorists in the middle of a trial.  Also, the characters are completely off the wall and incredibly entertaining: Gibbs is a borderline Luddite with some mysterious redhead in his life, DiNozzo is emotionally frozen at the age of 20, lab tech Abby is a Goth chick that shouldn't be associated with the Navy in the first place, and new girl Kate is slowly losing her sanity after being unceremoniously dumped from the Secret Service--probably because she let them steal Air Force One in the first standalone episode ""Yankee White"" in order to preserve physical evidence of a death.

HOPE IT STAYS ON TELEVISION FOR A LONG TIME TO COME.",1142380800,11,383,3.8461538461538463
