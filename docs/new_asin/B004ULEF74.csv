4467428,5,B004ULEF74,"This movie was first released in 1958(2011), in B/W and widescreen 1.85.1 and runs 80 minutes. The sound and picture quality are very good. The only extra is a full screen trailor. The film starts with Apaches slowly surrounding a cavalry and some other Indians approaching with a white flag and then their chief Santos introduces himself. But Major Warden (KENT TAYLOR) and his men open fire on the Apache. The Major boasts his tactics against the Apache massacre. Captain Tom Thompson (BEN JOHNSON), who just arrives doesnot approve of Major's tactics and says that the local farmers will now pay for this massacre. Some of the men call the Captain, Tamahawk Thompson, as he is also friendly to the Indians. They all return to FORT BOWIE. On arrival at the Fort, Colonel Jim Carbett tells the Major that Victorio had escaped and the Major should not have massacred the Apaches. Captain Thompson is ordered to bring Mrs Allison Carbett (JAN HARRISON), Colonel's wife from Tuscon to Fort Bowie. Victorio wants to kill many soldiers for the murder of Santos. At night, Capt Thompson and his men leave for Tuscon. They find she is not keen to go to Fort Bowie, and Capt Thompson, then forcefully dumps her in the wagon, and they are off. On the way, the station camp had been burnt by the Apaches. Soon the Apaches attack them from the hills, but are chased off. At the Fort, Allison claims to her husband that Capt Thompson had made love to her, so Colonel Garrett sends the Captain to talk to Victorio offering no terms, which could mean certain death for the Captain and his men. Captain Thompson asks Senzanah (JANA DAVI), if she knows where Victorio was. She was once Victorio's woman. But she tells the Captain that he was to be deliberately sent to Victorio, after Allison had told her husband bad things about the Captain.
How will it end? Will Captain Thompson find Victorio? Will Senzanah tell the Captain where victorio was? What will Major Warden do? Will the Major follow orders or do his own thing? Can Colonel Garrett stop Capt Thompson from certain death in the hands of Victorio? What will happen to the relationship between the Colonel and his wife? Will Victorio agree to surrender or fight? Will the Apache attack Fort Bowie?
This story of MAURICE TOMBRAGEL is beautifully photographed in B/W widescreen by CARL E GUTHRIE and brickly directed by HOWARD W KOCH. The action scenes are very good and Ben Johnson again gives a good performance.

8441675,3,B004ULEF74,Typical 50's cowboys and indians movie. I always was a Ben Johnson fan but this is like a B grade version of a Fort Apache.,1500508800,,123,3.96

*Plot and ending analyzed*

Fort Bowie (1958) is a horrible Western, and there are many reasons that being the case. The most notable is a diluted script, bad acting, and a baseless portrayal of the Apache Indians war tactics. Ben Johnson is ineffective as the lead man, for he's as stiff as a bucket of heavy lead. You don't know if he sympathizes with the Apaches or wants them all killed, since he alternates throughout.  I don't think it matters much since he comes off as some arrogant jerk.

The Apaches themselves are played as half-grunting oafs.  The plot is the standard U.S. Cavalry versus the much-hated Apaches.  One officer wants to use mild tactics, while another wants to kill them outright.

In the film, the Apaches attack a large fort head-on in one of the most ridiculous scenes of a Western. In reality, two Apaches could have sneaked in and burnt the fort during the night. But the Apaches were intelligent and always avoided large groups of soldiers or forts.

They also threw in a paltry love interest side-story that is so stupid that it defies any intelligence. The only reason to watch this film is because of the stuntmen who perform some good horse riding and battles scenes, that's about it.

Ben Johnson was a good character actor, but not a reliable lead.

This film falls short of being average at that.",1490054400,,1378,4.680497925311204

8441683,4,B004ULEF74,"I can't quite bring myself to agree with everything ""Batjac 60"" says, but I too can watch Ben in almost anything, and I do admit that a romantic scene leaves him lookin a bit uncomfortable, but the film itself has really pleased me, perhaps because I've never seen it before. Was it ever released in cinemas in the U/K? - probably - but I'm pretty sure it's never been on TV over here. The widescreen B/W print is first rate. The film is virtually all location, there is plenty of action and Ben is ably supported by Kent Taylor, with cliched perfs from the ladies, Jan Harrison and Jana Davi, both of whom do their best with the script, and of course, it's the script/plot that is a bit weak and tends to let the side down. I have no hesitation in recomending this to Ben/Western fans, with the proviso that you realise I am a western nutcase (but I still know a bad western when I see one, and this ain't one..it's good..even if it's not John Ford, and just misses 5 stars, but only just)",1327190400,8,990,4.2994652406417115
8441684,3,B004ULEF74,"I love Ben Johnson in just about anything, whether it was ""Fort Apache"", ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"", ""Dillinger"" up to ""The Train Robbers"" and his Oscar-winning turn in ""Last Picture Show"", he was always good, always charismatic.  This particular film can truly be called an ""ordinary oater"" with the Indians, wronged by the Calvalry, fighting troops led by Johnson's character.  You would have to be a true Ben Johnson-lover to shell out any ducats for this film.  But, I did.",1324339200,7,477,4.864197530864198
