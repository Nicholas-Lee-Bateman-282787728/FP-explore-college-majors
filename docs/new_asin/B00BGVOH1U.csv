8568325,1,B00BGVOH1U,"As soon as I received these CDs I thought ""Gross"" what an ugly case. But fortunately LRH knows how to deliver Tech right? Wrong, I felt let down. These are just The Phoenix Lectures which I don't think any Scientologist likes. I tried to get my money back by returning this purchase to my local Org. I was told that since I purchased it through Amazon there was no way for them to refund my money. I slapped the female staffer that said this to me. She started shaking but thankfully I was able to handle the situation. I explained to her that MY CDs were created by Bridge Publications and that she was selling items from Bridge at the Org and that it will all get returned to the same place. She laid there crying so I raised a fuss to the higher ups and got my money refunded. I think new staffers will always make my blood boil.",1376611200,,832,4.20625
