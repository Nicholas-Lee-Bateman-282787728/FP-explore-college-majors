5798759,4,B00DHB3U4W,"The discs come in plastic snap cases. They play fine.

Sons of Anarchy (2008-2014) is good, but the violence is cartoonish at times and theres a bit too much homosexual stuff for my tastes. I wanted the main protagonist to kill his mom and her boyfriend in the first episode. He gets around to killing them near the end of the series. The series ends well, all of the loose strings are tied up and all of the questions answered, thats why the last episode is highly rated. So a great start and a great finish but overall I liked Breaking Bad (2008-2013) better.

Most people are aware of corporate espionage and what some companies will do to protect their secrets. In the TV show Breaking Bad the two main characters, Walter White, played by Bryan Cranston, and Jesse Pinkman, played by Aaron Paul, possess the knowledge and skill to produce the best meth on the market. And their brand is easily identifiable by its unique blue color.

Several competing criminal organizations buy their services and try to replicate their product but Whites and Pinkmans skill in the art and science of making their blue meth product isn't easily duplicated. One group tries to hold Pinkman hostage in Mexico because their highly trained scientists cant make meth as well as he does. Near the end of the series another criminal group keeps Pinkman chained in their lab and force him to make meth for them because their guy, who worked with both White and Pinkman, is unable to duplicate Pinkmans and Walter Whites skill in the art and science of making their blue meth brand.

Breaking Bad has one of the best story and character arcs ever used in a TV show, which is why it has an IMDb rating of 9.5, right up there with Game of Thrones, another great show. The Wire (2002-2008) was as good as the Sons of Anarchy, but not as good as Breaking Bad. I won't give away the ending of Breaking Bad, but if you watch the complete series from the first episode to the last the ending will make complete sense and be very satisfying. Its terrific.

If the above series don't sound interesting here are a few of the series I really enjoyed watching more than once: Band of Brothers (2001), Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Black Sails (2014-2017), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lonesome Dove (1989), Lost (2004-2010), Merlin (2008-2012), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek The Original Series (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish, or the hundreds of fantasy and science fiction shows Ive watched.

If you like reading try some of my favorite authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1520380800,,3062,4.924418604651163

5798761,5,B00DHB3U4W,"this show was so addicting with the family and the club brother hood, great acting such versatility among the actors and the way they perform together, was disappointed about tara but i understand the reasoning, sad that jax didn't see all the signs of conflict between tara and gemma to truly see that his mothers happiness and control was all that mattered no matter the cost, killing tara was an accident she said a accident is shoving someones face in the water and trying to drown her, down right hatred is when you stab someone 6 times in the back of the skull,gemma may have loved her son, but she knew that tara and jax had a love and a connection that she never had and never truly understood, that is why tara was always a threat to gemma even as a teenage love she still controlled jax then too, and at the end with all her lies she controlled him all the way to his death, he had no other choice than to die, than live not being able to connect with someone and love like he needed too, so sad!!",1517961600,,1007,4.25

Ironic too, considering I had just been raving to my brother how awesome this show is earlier today. It's like all of a sudden, the writers and actors/actresses stopped caring about the quality of the show. I'm not even going to waste my time watching any more of this, except to get to the part where Tara gets killed, just out of curiosity.",1486771200,,492,4.358695652173913

If it were the third or even the fourth season, I'd be done. Up to now, there's been a bit of humor, fairness, displays of redeeming qualities and the club did some good in the world. It made the violence easier to swallow. No more. I don't know why, in God's name, any of these people believe anything the other one says. They're lying out their teeth so why do they assume the other person is being truthful? And then PERFUNCTORILY GO KILL PEOPLE BASED ON LIES.

5799032,3,B00DHB3U4W,"After this season, I rage quit. I could understand why FX tapped out with 7, season six is a trainwreck. It was really good, but had the same lethargic pace as Breaking Bad: It would just be annoying if you saw each episode on its release date. There are a lot of silent moments or moments that just has music and pans over where the actors are for like three minutes. I've touched the skip ten seconds button so many times. I really wish my friends didn't recommend this series, because in my opinion, it's a waste of time. I'm not even going to watch season seven, because of this series' predictable formula.
By the way, the deaths of my two favorite characters -- who I will not name to not spoil -- they're murders were in my nightmares for a month. No thank you for being so brutal to nice people...
I guess the only thing you can say is good is that this series highlights bad things that happen in society....",1479081600,,917,4.30635838150289

Did JT have a plan to turn the club into a movement of anarchists?  What could that old bag Emma Goldman have to do with a guy being inspired to form an MC?  It probably won't ever be made clear.  Was Jax going to turn the club away from crime and make it a group of Harley owners who devote their time to toy runs for the kiddies, or what?

FX made the dvd collection annoying to view by including the song lyrics in the subtitles along with the script. The characters' lines will be displayed and the lyrics of whatever song is playing in the background will be displayed as though they are being spoken by the actors speaking their lines.",1472342400,,758,4.229166666666667

We binge-watched the first 5 seasons and then used Amazon to watch the few episodes of the 6th season that we couldn't get our hands on elsewhere until we were finally caught up. The show is deep and dark in all the right ways. Who knew you could empathize with criminals and murderers?! This show keeps you watching like no other. Great cast.

Watching the first five seasons in a semi-marathon binge, I've been exposed to the endless plot twists and turns combined with the sometimes overdone melodrama. You gotta feel for these guys, they never seem to have a relaxing, peaceful day.

Season six continues the pattern, with Jax doing his best to steer the club in a new, more benign, direction. Good luck with that. And Clay seems to have more lives than Garfield.

Definitely entertaining, just suspend any reasoned analysis as is necessary with almost all TV fare.",1469491200,,567,4.895833333333333

5801004,3,B00DHB3U4W,First season was great; then it was downhill from there.  Enjoyed Season 2; Season 3 less so.  They should have ended this series with Season 5.  Just was dragged out and the same people doing stupid stuff; came to the point it was highly predictable.  If someone had an opportunity to do something stupid; they would.  We are in Season 6 somewhere; not sure if we'll finish it.,1465776000,4,378,4.5

5801219,5,B00DHB3U4W,"This is a season where they spin ALL the plates. All the characters get to play a bit. Nero is amongst those they give a really great supporting role into. Tara gets the meatiest story as well as Clay. The Irish arc really comes to its end in a way that makes the most sense.

They setup the final season in very good fashion by planting the seeds in the last two episodes. I feel like some of the story lines were put in just to offset others and make up the difference. As far as filler goes, great quality.

And we finally see what Gemma is REALLY made of as well as Tara.",1458000000,,575,4.035087719298246

5801323,5,B00DHB3U4W,"I finished the final season this morning and I'll have to say that it was great entertainment.  This, from an ex-federal law enforcement official.  I was somewhat disturbed because I kept catching myself rooting for the thugs and seeing them as regular people with problems like everyone else.  Of course we normal people don't just shoot or stab everyone we have a disagreement with. However, the law enforcement people is this program were mostly a little shady.  It appears that general knowledge of biker gangs, the author's story seemed authentic and made the show really interesting.  The acting was sensational and most of the actors were not known by me prior to watching the show.  As I said in another review earlier in the season, the show would be more accurately titled if it had been named, ""SONS OF DUPLICITY.""",1454457600,2,825,4.857142857142857

5801349,5,B00DHB3U4W,"This is perhaps the best season of the show. SPOILERS.  The show's sympathies  and perhaps perspective shifts as Tara's disconnect coalesces into a plan to save her boys.  Her disconnect from Jax is palpable and heartbreaking, and provides the dramatic thrust of the season (amazing work from Maggie Siff and Charlie Hunnam in this respect).  The season's refrain for characters to own their place (it is direct with Jax, but certainly Tara confronts this) is powerful and certainly heartbreaking in the last few moments as that refrain is lost with Tara's death.  This is also the season where major players (e.g. Clay) are murdered and Jax really starts to become Clay even as he makes sacrifices that say otherwise.  Awesome performances also by CCH Pounder, Rockmond Dunbar, but leads Maggie, Ron (as resigned Clay)'and Charlie bring it. Awesome set up for season 7.

That last montage/scene is everything.",1453593600,2,910,5.108108108108108

Season 6 was pretty much non-stop story line and action with very little filler. I ended up binge watching this season in 2--days to catch up before Season 7 premiered. The ending of this season will shock the hell out of you. If you are reading this review then I am guessing you have watched the previous 5 so yeah....obviously buy and watch this....you will not be disappointed.

As for the standard stuff.....the discs played fine with no skips, the set came unopened and looked perfect, and it looked to have plenty of special features that I don't care about and did not watch.",1452297600,,688,4.504

Furthermore, the gratuitous violence is much more significant the later you progress into the series. The story lines are good; there's no need to show everything just because you can. I will continue to watch through the end of the series, but I'm not sure I will miss it when I'm done. Hell on Wheels and Justified are equally compelling but ultimately more satisfying.",1448323200,,534,4.752688172043011

It seemed to just go downhill after that season...but like a true addict I continued to watch. Season 6 was just AWFUL. The entire reason most of us watched was because although these are the ""good"" bad guys....they were loveable despite doing terrible things. This season....YUCK. Jax's behavior was totally uncharacteristic. His treatment toward his wife was absurd, not to mention his infidelity being cruel at best. In short...I will NOT waste my time on season 7.

5812650,4,B00DHB3U4W,"It's rumbling right along, the acting has remained strong, various characters have risen to and fallen from prominence in this season, and even though some of the action is somewhat foreshadowed and thus expected, the way it goes down is pretty consistently surprising. Jax continues to  ""get pulled back in,"" to paraphrase the famous line from the Godfather.  It'll pull you back in, too. At times, it seems to border on the didactic--""If you lie, look what happens,"" as in the various plot lines where a murder (like Piney's) is blamed on a rival gang, resulting in slaughter.  But wotthehell--it's a great yarn with a lot of strands. You still need a stomach for violence, though, and S.O.A. serves up plenty of it.",1444262400,5,718,4.821138211382114

So sad when he turned to the whore and especially when Tara came in and caught him.  From that moment on I cried until the end of sixth season seeing what Tara and Jax were going through.  Loved scene after Bobby was shot when Tara pulled her hand through Jax's.  Loved the scene at the park and then in hotel room.  Was so glad they found each other again.  I have watched episode several times and I always cry.  .  Can't remember when a movie, TV show has affected me so.  Maggie and Charlie did an outstanding job.

Too unredeemable and I like at least a little redemption in my stories. I wanted to see Jaxs good heart win the battle with the darkness of his life. I wanted some small piece of his soul to survive the bulls*** of his life choices. I loved the idea of an outlaw but not so much a psychopathic outlaw which is where this season seem to be taking him...no redemption at all just a giving in to the evil and the lies. I'm really glad they ended the season as they did. It took courage to kill off so many major players! Don't know how they will manage to wrap it up but despite my reservations and beginning to not like Jaxs very much, I'm back in his corner now. Gemma...not so much.",1438041600,,804,4.160256410256411

5818036,1,B00DHB3U4W,"I'm glad you asked. I wasted an enormous amount of time by having watched the whole series (after it was over on TV.) I guess I must of been mesmerized  by how a series could drag on and on based on little more than gore and mutilation. It's a real testament when the best acting of all cast came from Jimmy Smitt. Watching Samcro was like watching a bad episode of Keystone Cops. In fact, Jaxson tried  so hard to be cool, he even walked like Charlie Chapman. I guess there's enough people out there that would watch this kind of meaningless garbage to justify 13 episodes a year for 7 years. The only positive I can come away with is; it really portrays biker gangs as the bunch of idiot douchebags they are.",1435449600,,710,4.291044776119403

5818595,5,B00DHB3U4W,"The entire SOA series is a strange mixture of Hamlet meets MacBeth and the Godfather. There's nothing wrong with this, in fact the basic themes are pretty much universal dramatic themes. I enjoyed the entire series (I haven't seen the final season yet, but I will), I thought the acting was great, and even the fact that there was disaster after disaster, kind of fed into the ""these folks live a life of chaos"" meme.

I can't speak to how realistic the series was in portraying an actual biker club, but it was a fun ride for all six seasons. If you don't mind gratuitous sex, violence and mega-ink, this is a good series for grown-ups only. BTW, the season finale was....well it just was.",1427414400,,690,4.52

8593120,5,B00DHB3U4W,"Another very good season, but once again, the Commentary on Episode 1 has at least three spoilers of deaths of characters in future episodes of the season.  Not everyone has seen the entire season who buys a DVD.  That is the reason I am buying the DVD in this case, since I never watched the show while it was still being aired.  It is extremely annoying to have the season ruined with these spoilers, thinking the comments are going to be about the episode I just watched, as in all previous seasons except Season 5.  I recommend doing the Commentaries right after the episode is made or shown, so that everyone is still in the mode of keeping secret what goes on in future episodes.  During the season, those secrets are guarded, why not on the DVD?!  Everyone knows to watch the episode being commented on first, before listening to the Commentary, but it is ridiculous to have to watch the entire season before watching an Episode 1 Commentary.",1527465600,,949,4.585798816568047
8593121,5,B00DHB3U4W,Highly recommended this TV series.  You'll be hooked from the first episode!  Definitely  not recommended for anyone under 17 due to the level of violence and sex. I was quite surprised I liked the show because it's not something I would usually watch.  I have since recommended it to others.,1527465600,,292,4.78
