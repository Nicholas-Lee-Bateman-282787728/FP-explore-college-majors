The main characters are the two people, a tractor, combine, four wheeler, pickup, sheep dog, colt, and horse.  The sheep in the video are often up to mischief and oh so cute!  I saw this video on youtube and was so happy to find an US zoned version on Amazon.  I wish I could find more it is a great video and so much fun!",1361664000,,416,4.08641975308642
8234031,5,B000YSHYUC,"I have 2 young grandsons that love tractors and I have seen a Tractor Tom children's cartoon on the Pay TV channel in Australia but haven't been able to find a copy to buy in the retail stores here.
This DVD was one of two that I ordered from different suppliers and was exactly what I was looking for.
I received an order acknowledgement within a couple of days and the DVD arrived by post in just over a week from the date of order!
This is the first time that I've used Amazon, so it's given me confidence to keep using the site!",1273449600,,532,4.125
