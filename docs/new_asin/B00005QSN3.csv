1648982,3,B00005QSN3,"Just a fun movie with a very young Keaneau Reeves.  Lori Loughlin is also in it.  I always liked her.  Wish Hollywood would have had sense enough to put her in more movies.

Basically about a prom night that goes really bad.  Good laughs and cameos.

I waited a LONG time for this to be release on DVD.  Was worth the wait.",1241222400,3,323,4.112903225806452
1648983,1,B00005QSN3,"Can't believe some studios foist full-screen hatchet jobs this late in the game.  Especially this one, was looking forward to this finally coming out.",1240963200,11,150,5.25
1648984,5,B00005QSN3,"Few actors can successfully act roles like  Winston Connelly  And Neo.  I am amazed at Keanu's comedic genius which shows up in a hand full of his other films...""Tune in Tomorrow,"" "" The Prince of Pennsylvania""  ""Bill and Ted"", to name a few.
 I am a professional musician/ amateur film maker/ avid film buff. Because of a friend's insistence, I saw my very first Keanu film in 2005. For the next several months I watched every film Reeves had made.  I was stunned by the variety of roles he had taken on.
 Every aspect of this film is imaginative and delightful. The Music Score by Mark Davis creates a wonderful sound stage for all the scenes, particularly  all the outdoor set designs.  Add to this the  supreme music of  George Clinton's band appearing in a dance scene. They are fabulous.
All the supporting actors are top notch: The stage sets, lighting, cinematography are first-rate..
Lori Loughlin and Keanu are hugely entertaining. Loughlin couldn't be better in her role. The two of them are on a par with the best of comedic couples.
""Night Before"" is one of my favorite Keanu films.",1239494400,,1095,4.680628272251309
1648985,4,B00005QSN3,"i've been looking for this movie for years.  finally, after releasing all the mindless dribble that heads straight for the five-dollar bin at wal-mart, The Night Before hits the rack.  One of my all-time favorite Keanu movies... this is genuine awesome pre-""bill and ted"" stuff.  Lori Loughlin (full house) is cute as hell and you can't help but wish Keanu was YOUR prom date...loser or not.  Great soundtrack, original story (for it's time and even now)...despite being about five dollars overpriced, well worth the $$$.  Can't wait to see it again.",1236988800,,550,5.0
1648986,5,B00005QSN3,"Entertaining comedy with Keanu Reeves and Lori Loughlin. Winston wakes up in the middle of the night on a street and is only step by step able to remember, what he has done before. Especially, under the unintentional influence of drugs, he has sold his vain ball partner Tara, daughter of a policeman, to a pimp. Great fun movie.",1135987200,,329,4.593220338983051
1648987,4,B00005QSN3,"It is known to many, that to find a good teen movie, you must look further than the video shelves of your local Video Hire. Sure, there is 'Pretty In Pink', 'The Breakfast Club' and more recently 'Get Over It', but they all rely on the love triangle's to boost thier plot. 'The Night Before' is different, not only in the conventional, but the unconventional. Creating laughs from the twisted love match of Reeves & Loughlin, the seedy going-ons that run the streets at night, to slapstick escapades that adorn the closing sequences. This is a must for any lover of films, or the Weird and Wonderful that fill studio backlists to the brim. Deleted in the UK, buy quick from America, a minor masterpiece of Hollywood legends.",1031875200,23,724,4.6640625
1648988,4,B00005QSN3,"This is a really funny, feel good movie with a happy ending.  Lori Loughlin's character loses a bet with friends and has to take nerdy Winston Connelly (Keanu Reeves) as her prom date.  Through a chain of events -- including getting lost, a broken down car, a bar in a bad neighborhood, a pimp, and the girl's policeman father -- they NEVER reach the prom at all.  Winston proves to be a hero instead of a nerd and earns Lori's character's devotion by the end.  Keanu Reeves is charming and not the airhead character he protrayed many times in his early career.  He and Lori Loughlin have a nice chemistry.",969667200,46,606,4.472727272727273

1649053,5,B00005QSN3,"I had seen this years ago and thoroughly enjoyed every bit.  Just revisited this little comedy gem and had to recommend it.  First, of course, KEANU, YOUNG ADORABLE KEANU!  However, both he and his beautiful co-star, Lori, give such amazingly charming and, at times, downright hilarious performances.  Don't be misled by past criticisms of this movie.  I have read that KR has himself stated that he was happy with his choice to do ""The Night Before.""  Give this one a whirl.  You'll be glad you did!",1462320000,5,500,4.744186046511628
1649054,4,B00005QSN3,"A VERY young and extremely adorable Keanu Reeves plays Winston Connelly, a sheltered and innocent suburban teenager who gets lost on the way to prom, takes his date to The Wrong Side Of The Tracks, is roofied, and manages to accidentally sells her into prostitution because he has so little idea of what is going on. The story initially unfolds slowly and out of order in flashbacks (""where am I?""), then becomes linear as he figures out how to find and rescue her. Best sequence: Keanu and the lovely Lori Laughlin dancing to the funky music of ""The Rats Nest Band"", which happen to be none other than George Clinton and Bootsy Collins, and then at the end a quite satisfying car chase (there was a little John Wick in him even then). Lots of jokes and stereotypes about various low life inner city denizens, and about the hilarious (sarcasm) topic of human trafficking.  Even though much of it is funny, and arguably avoids overt racism, it's just not always on the right side of the taste line.  Not sure this film was ever theatrically released, and I'm guessing this is why. As an aside, after I watched this I went to Man Of Tai Chi, where 25-years-later Keanu plays the knowing and evil Donneka Mark--got whiplash going from one character extreme to another.",1458691200,7,1265,4.642857142857143

I was searching for some movies to put on my kindle for a trip and was delighted to find that The Night Before was available. I enjoyed it just as much now as then. In the meantime, I've raised to daughters who are now adults. Luckily, I didn't think about this movie for a couple decades, so I wasn't nervous when they went to the prom.

1649179,5,B00005QSN3,"I was happy to get my hands on The Night Before on dvd (My VHS Version is beat-up)
I have mixed thoughts on the DVD
Lionsgate has done such a Great job in the past on both DVD's & BR's
This dvd on the other hand is a Poor dvd Digital Transfer  (The print looks worn I'd guess they took the VHS Version and transferred it to dvd) The 5.1 Audio is also a bit hinky
The trivia track is more of a lame  gimmick (Why no Audio Commentary???)
This DVD would be fine if It was made 10-12yrs ago when The dvd Format first came out (But, Now to have such a Poor  Official Copy is unacceptable
There are a number of Other Titles in there ""Lost Collection""  I'd like 2 add to my Collection but, after watching this dvd I'm not sure
Shame on Lionsgate for putting out Such a Bootleg/Poor DVD of a  Great Rarely Seen Film
They dropped the ball on putting this out on dvd
The Film itself is so Good and over looked . I'd say it's one of the Best PG-13 of the 1980's!
I'm sure it gained a Cult type Following thanks to the VHS Era
Starring Two Young up and coming stars  Keanu Reeves  & Lori Loughlin
The two are both extremely good in it. They both play it straight in a Crazy Over-the top world!
The Music/Score also is top notch (Doesn't sound like a typical 1980's Movie) The Great King of Funk George Clinton wrote the Score
the score/music was and still to this day Fresh and ahead of it's time for a teen flick!
For those who have never seen it (which I'm sure is  allot of people)  It's a Must see Treasure
The Film itself  9.5/10
The DVD along with the Laserdisc are the only two Digital Copies
Hopefully this dvd gets word of mouth maybe One day A Studio will put out a Cleaned-up Special Edition
Cause this Film Deserves a Special Edition
It's a Odd Classic to say the least",1271462400,11,1769,4.101449275362318
1649180,3,B00005QSN3,"I watched this dvd on my lcd flat panel , and the picture is full of what i would call 'digital noise' meaning it has lots of 'micro' pixelation, especially in darker areas of the movie. Even the VHS version of this movie is better than this. Also it seems that it was transferred not from the master tapes, but from Vhs stockpile with bad digital noise at times. But since its finally on DVD , I'll take it, but I'm not very happy with the digital noise artifacts, it makes the movie look , almost cartoonish in darker areas. I'm hoping for a second better release (though i doubt it) and hopefully a blu ray release that is done right. I don't really mind that its full screen, that doesn't bother too much. I'm more concerned with the picture quality. Also there is no trailer for this movie, but trailers for other movies. Also the case it came in is very flimsy. It has that recycle logo hole on the case. I don't know if they want you to throw it out afterwards and recycle it.

1649182,5,B00005QSN3,"If you want to enjoy a simple, family movie, then The Night Before is the one for you. It's one great movie with Keanus Reeves when he was young, and Lori Loughlin. This a mishap of young boy that get to take to the prom nothing less than the most popular, prettiest girl in high school to the prom due to a bet that Lori Loughlin lost. You won't believe what happen outside of a prom night.
Enjoy this delightful movie from the '80s, I recommended for the whole family. If you enjoyed it in VHS, you sure gonna love it in DVD.",1257033600,,527,4.12621359223301
1649183,4,B00005QSN3,"Originally I got this great 80's comedy from an HD rip online, but this is just as good and with a decent cover.  Sadly, like all of the ""Lost Collection"" series, it is in full screen and has a fake 5.1 soundtrack.  For those who want to know, all of the ""Lost Collection"" films are supposed to be in 5.1 Dolby Digital audio.  This is not true.  Every channel sounds the same as track 3, which is all of the music, dialog and special effects mixed together.  A perfect 5.1 DVD has music in the first channel, sound effects with some dialog in the second, everything mixed together in the third, track 4 is base, and the last two channels are for rear sounds, sometimes containing a clearer isolated music track.  None of the ""Lost Collection"" discs are like this, making them fake 5.1 audio and that really hurts my view of Lionsgate.  ""The Night Before"" is still a must-have comedy, but don't look for awesome sound or anamorphic widescreen.",1242950400,13,942,4.5058823529411764
1649184,5,B00005QSN3,"I'm a fan of Keanu Reeves. He's the right person to fill this shy, backward, timid boy role. I like the premise of the movie. It really captures the spoof of the tug versus the clueless boy. Even though the violence was there this movie made me laugh almost all the way through.",1242345600,,278,4.264150943396227
1649185,5,B00005QSN3,"I've never been much for Keanu Reeves.  I'd always thought the guy was a throwaway schmuck who somehow got lucky and impressed the right people to get to where he is today.  Not to mention a lousy actor!  Can anyone honestly buy Reeves as an Englishman(in Bram Stoker's Dracula) or a southern lawyer(in The Devil's Advocate)?  Then someone got the hot idea of trying to make Reeves into some kind of action star like in Point Break, Speed and The Matrix!  I don't know who thought this was a good idea, but Reeves is as convincing playing a tough guy or cop as he would be playing Cab Calloway.
But it's not so much Reeves' fault, he just isn't put in the right roles.  That's where the Night Before comes in.  This is the ultimate Keanu reeves film.  I used to watch it over and over back when it was constantly played on HBO.  I even had the one sheet poster hanging in my bedroom at one time!
It's the best acting Reeves has ever done.  Why?  Because he's totally believable in this role.  This dorky kind of character is what Reeves is born to play.  He's so good in this, he carries the whole film.  Bill & Ted is a close second, and I'll give the guy credit, he was good in River's Edge.  But this is Reeves' masterpiece.
It's kinda like a lighter version of Scorsese's After Hours.  Reeves is high school nerd, Winston Connelly.  He wakes up in an alley in a slum part of L.A. and can't remember how he got there.  As he wanders around the streets and has run ins with various characters, bit by bit he remembers what had happened earlier that night.  He had taken the most popular girl in school, Tara, to the prom(she had lost a bet with her friend and as the loser, she had to go to the prom with the school geek.  It's funny coz she pretty much tells Winston this flat out, but he either doesn't care or is too dumb to understand the situation), but through a series of goofy events, he ended up selling her to a pimp and winding up on that pimp's hit list.  Now Winston must find Tara in the wee hours of the morning before he ends up dead, either at the hands of the angry pimp, or Tara's detective father.  During his quest he meets a bunch of odd characters, including a helpful prostitute played by Teresa Saldana.  A subplot appears to have been cut from the film.  I think the idea is that Winston had had sex with Saldana's character the night before, as she hints at this when we first see her.  Plus, I remember the plot description on the back of the VHS box saying that Winston had lost his date, his car, and his virginity all in one night!  Oh, well, it woulda been cool.  I know I'd do Teresa Saldana(and Lori Loughlin for that matter).  In the club scenes we're treated to George Clinton, Bootsy Collins and the P-Funk All stars.  In fact, it's because of this movie that I even know of George Clinton.  If I hadn't had seen The Night Before, I'd probably never had bought a Parliament or Funkadelic album.  They have some awesome songs for the film.  If anyone knows if these songs are available on cd, please let me know.
By the end of the night, Winston has gone through a period of self discovery and has become a tougher and more confident guy.  Not to mention Tara now has the hots for him!
This is quite the entertaining movie.  I gave it five stars, mostly due to childhood nostalgia, but this film is actually pretty good.  I'm surprised it never became more popular.  Again, Reeves is terrific in this part.  This is a part he was born to play, and as absurd as many of the situations are, he's believable as this character.  Even when he becomes more of a tough guy throughout the night, it really works coz he's so clumsy when trying to be a hero.  Lori Loughlin is a snotty little turd, but man, is she a cutie.
The film was directed by Thom Eberhardt, who also made the quirky and fun, Night of the Comet.
It's great that Lionsgate has released a batch of ""lost"" films of the 80s, I hope to see more released over time.  The DVD is pretty much bare bones except for an optional Trivia Track which is very disappointing because it barely pertains to the movie at all!  I was hoping for some cool The Night Before fun facts, but it was all lame-o information.  But it is still great to finally have this one out on DVD.  Thankfully I never bit the bullet and bought that bootleg copy on Ebay!",1241568000,2,4331,4.282019704433497
