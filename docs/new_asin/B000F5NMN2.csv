2552758,5,B000F5NMN2,"My 18 month old loves the songs and dances along with the show.  She isn't allowed to watch much tv, but this is by far her favorite show.  It teaches positive morals and the songs are very open about Jesus being the way to Heaven.  The salvation message is clearly portrayed in this dvd.",1364774400,5,288,4.296296296296297
2552759,5,B000F5NMN2,"My husband bought this for our kids to watch, knowing nothing about Psalty at all. We very soon realised this show was a hit in our house. It is a live recorded stage show packed with loads of songs, crowd participation & humour!! The show lasts roughly an hour and begin with the 'bad guy' rat, who tries to thwart Psaltys attempts to carry out his show - he phones Psaltys regular cast of kids & tells them the show is off! OH NO! However the audience comes to the rescue as willing cast members & the performance goes on! Halfway through the rat is thwarted & leaves - this is done in a highly amusing way - especially if you're a child!! My children love the songs and sing along & I am happy to leave them watching it knowing there is nothing scary or bad in it.
A very up beat & highly entertaining show - a little outdated clothes wise(& hairdo's!) now as it must have been recorded in the 1980's!!",1280016000,6,905,4.206896551724138
2552760,2,B000F5NMN2,"I grew up watching Psalty, Gospel Bill, McGee and Me and shows alike, in church and at home. My mom had the idea to buy some Psalty DVD's for my niece who is 1 year old. I first bought Psalty's camping adventure, and my niece loves it. Shes glued to it the moment she hears Psalty's voice. So I found this one thinking she would enjoy it as well. From what I have been told (I have not personally seen this DVD) there is a ""evil bad guy"" and he is ""dark/depressing"" and my niece won't watch it at all. infact she cries. So just a thought if you are buying for a young child...",1265587200,5,576,4.017391304347826
2552761,3,B000F5NMN2,"This Psalty video is loved by my children (age 2-5). They ask for it on a regular basis. It includes lots of neat songs. However, the big blue song book and other characters are annoying to me as a grown up. The whole thing is dumbed down. I keep it only because the kids like it so much.",1131494400,,288,3.9827586206896552

8117777,5,B000F5NMN2,"The children love it. We had Psalty's Praise Party Two for years. I eventually set some time aside and bought this. In my opinion it's not as good as the 2nd one, but the children can't tell the difference I suppose!",1417392000,2,216,4.2926829268292686
8117778,3,B000F5NMN2,"It was a great purchase, but it was the wrong movie.  Not because the advertisement was bad, it was everything that the seller said it would be.  I wanted the original Psalty movie, and this was something else.  I would do business again with the seller, but read the details on my part.",1397865600,5,287,4.377358490566038
