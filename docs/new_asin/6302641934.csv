488857,3,6302641934,"Had not seen this movie since I was 5 in 1971, loved every minute of it. All of the actors are 'playing themselves' great performances by Shelley Winters, Phil Silvers and Telly Savalas. A great classic that does not get much paly on tv or cable, so you have not seen it 20 times. Great look at American perspective on Europe, and how it has not changed much in the 30-odd years since the film was made.",971136000,10,403,4.246753246753247

488883,4,6302641934,"A sparkling farce, BUONA SERA MRS CAMPBELL has radiant Gina Lollobrigida, an all-star supporting cast, and gorgeous Italian location photography.  Carla Campbell (Lollobrigida) has carved out a respectable life and successful business for herself and her lovely daughter Gia (Janet Margolin) in the town of San Forino, but everything is about to come crashing down....

You see, some 20 years ago in the final chaotic months of WW2, a then-16-year-old Carla shared a house with three American G.I.'s, discoverd she was pregnant after their departure, and for the next 20 years has collected a monthly child support payment from each of them... Now those same three former G.I.'s (Peter Lawford, Telly Savalas and Phil Silvers) along with their wives (Lee Grant, Marian Moses and Shelley Winters) are headed back to San Forino for a grand reunion festival!  Each man thinks he's Gia's father... and none of the wives know about their husbands' Italian wartime romance.

Director Melvin Frank had previously worked with Gina Lollobrigida in the 1965 comedy ""Strange Bedfellows"" and crafted this film as a showcase for her special comedic talents, but her co-stars often threaten to steal the spotlight, especially Lee Grant and Shelley Winters who both shine in some gleeful comedy moments.  Costume designer Morton Haack dresses the gals in some fabulous clothes as well.

This movie was later adapted into the 1979 Broadway musical ""Carmelina""; and also formed the basis for the smash hit ABBA musical ""Mamma Mia"".",1441065600,2,1514,5.235537190082645

Obviously the story on which the musical, ""Mamma Mia,"" was based, this clever, stylish & very amusing film can be watched again & again - and is funny every time. You don't have to have visited Italy or have had fathers in WWII in order to enjoy it; but, if you have, you'll find it even more entertaining.  I'm so thankful to have located this '60s classic!",1391212800,,519,4.56989247311828

In a frunny way Peter Lawford, Telly Savalas and Phil Silvers
get screwed for the screwing they got as GI's by Gina Lollabrigida.

488914,2,6302641934,"Gina Lollobrigida is nice to look at, and Phil Silvers, Telly Salavas, and Peter Lawford are all cute in a bumbling sort of way, but there were better films than this made in America in 1968! Go look for them instead of seeing this.

It has what looks like the earliest color-- the 1939 Gone with the Wind has more realistic color-- Phil Silvers's yellow sweater and the yellow wall behind him is just too much yellow.

Watch tv instead.",1368748800,,437,4.45
488915,1,6302641934,"I bought the Region 2 import from Spain DVD of ""Buona Sera Mrs. Campbell"", one of my favourite movies.  The copy I received is a burnt DVD-R.  The picture quality is atrocious, worse than a VHS tape recorded at EP speed.  The English soundtrack plays on the right channel only, the Spanish track plays stereo on both channels.

This DVD version of this movie is totally unwatcheable!  This is the DVD with the picture of 3 guys and 2 women on the cover with the title ""Buona Sera Sra. Campbell"" in the center in yellow letters.",1343865600,,527,4.447916666666667
488916,5,6302641934,"For almost twenty years, an Italian woman (Gina Lollobrigida) and her daughter (Janet Margolin) have been supported by the monthly checks of three American men (Phil Silvers, Telly Savalas, Peter Lawford). Though none of the men know about the other, each of them believes he is the father of the girl since all three men were intimate with the mother during a ten day period during WWII. But when a twenty year reunion occurs, all three men return to Italy (along with their wives) hoping to see their daughter. That's when the fun starts! This giddy farce is reminiscent of the classic screwball comedies of the 30s and 40s. While it may lack the elegance and wit of an AWFUL TRUTH or reach the madcap hysterics of BRINGING UP BABY, it's close enough so that any quibbling is minor. Lollobrigida is gorgeous but it's the supporting players who shine. In particular, the inspired casting of Shelley Winters and Silvers as a perfectly match married couple, each of them doing impeccable double takes. Savalas as a loud American and Lee Grant as his brassy wife keep it up too. The film's plot was unofficially usurped for the musical MAMMA MIA!. Directed by Melvin Frank. With Phillippe Leroy, Marian McCargo and Naomi Stevens.

The Australian DVD courtesy of Shock video is a nice anamorphic wide screen (1.85) transfer. Since it's a region 0, it should be playable on all DVD players.",1343692800,,1386,4.799163179916318

488929,5,6302641934,"It may not have3 the music of ABBA, but Buona Sera, Mrs. Campbell has much better writing, acting,  and directing.  It is essentially the same story.  Gina Lollabridida is an Italian girl from a beautiful mountain village who finds comfort with three different American soldiers, played by Phil Silvers, Peter Lawford, and Telly Savalas.  A few days after they all leave, she discovers that she is pregnant.  Not knowing which is the father, she goes to Paris to have the baby.  She invents a husband and father for the baby, a non-existent American flyer.  Needing a name for the flyer, she only knows two American names, Coca-Cola and Campbell Soup.  Thus, she chooses to become Mrs.  Campbell, the widow of an American hero.

She does contact each of the three possible fathers, and each thinks that only he is the father.  Each is married, although only one has children, Phil Silvers.  Each of the three sends her a monthly check for the next twenty years which she uses to rear Gia Campbell, their daughter.

Her problem arises when the squadron holds its twenty year reunion in the Italian village that they had loved so much.  Each of the fathers returns, along with their unsuspecting wives, to meet their daughter.  The deception is finally revealed, but not without the humor that only LOllabrigida can bring to a role.  As the most underrated comic actress of her generation, she entertains in any comic situation and somehow makes it seem believable.

How a twenty-year deception can lead to such a heart=warming conclusion as each continues to hope that he is the father, knowing that the other ""fathers"" exist, is the product of some good writing.  This story needs no music to be among the better comedies of the twentieth century.  It has what a movie should have, acting and writing.",1311724800,,1801,4.807817589576548

488932,5,6302641934,"I bought this after seeing ""Mama Mia"" - that brought back vague memories of this movie so I looked it up. Frankly it's better than Mama Mia, and it's disappointing that the makers of that movie didn't even have the class to credit this one as inspiration and source. Gina Lollobrigida is beautiful and very funny in this, along with Telly Savales, Phil Silvers, and Shelley Winters turning in great performances. Very enjoyable.",1271203200,2,428,4.876712328767123
488933,5,6302641934,"This dvd is only for Region 2. There is no dvd release for region 1, which is sad to me. This is a gem of a film that deserves a proper release. Maybe even on bluray but atleast a dvd release. Gina Lolobrigida is in her prime playing the ""widowed"" Mrs. Campbell. I won't spoil the rest but this is easily the predecessor to Abba The Musical and it's easy to see why. However, it's pure eye candy to behold the lovely Gina playing Mrs Campbell in this movie and yes, she can act! Please, please, please, release this movie for the rest of the world!!!",1269388800,4,550,4.19811320754717

488935,5,6302641934,"It amazes me that this movie remains mired in VHS-land. Even the Spanish DVD version is only a re-recording from a VHS version with poor quality video and mono sound. Buona Sera Mrs Campbell is a GEM of a movie, made during a period of first-rate comedies and with a stellar cast. The plot was so so good that it made great background for the modern ABBA musical of Mama Mia! without justified recognition. It would be good to see this movie and many others of the time given their due desserts of restoration to DVD quality. I am sure that I not alone in my generation of avid moviegoers who feel some nostalgia for the gentle comedies of the sixties. They were made and performed by some of the finest exponents of their time.",1260403200,2,728,4.4
488936,5,6302641934,"I agree with the other reviewer about ""Mamma Mia.""  When I saw it in London in May 2000, my first thought was: This story line seems so familiar.  Then I saw ""Buona Sera, Mrs. Campbell"" again on cable recently and realized the guys from ABBA ripped off this story for their music-filled spectacular.  Gina Lollabrigida creates and is the center of the storm when three Americans, ex-GI's she met in the war, come back to Italy. They've been paying her money every month for years believing they are the father of her daughter ""Gia"" (played by the lovely and sadly late Janet Margolin)  She borrows her name from a can of Campbell's soup and makes up a past for her family and leads the three GI's to believe each one is the father.

The cast is great, Telly Savalas, Phil Silvers, Lee Grant and Shelley Winters, who is something of a whirling dervish, chewing up the scenery and displaying a gift for broad physical comedy.

It's a very well-made film, one I didn't fully appreciate when I saw it on TV as a child.  Apparently they tried to turn it into a stage musical once before ""Mamma Mia"" (""Carmelina"" in 1979, according to Wikipedia)  But the guys from ABBA got it right and turned this into an international sensation.",1255737600,,1225,4.561643835616438
488937,5,6302641934,"Somebody is missing the boat by not releasing a DVD of this wonderful little comedy while there is so much interest in Mama Mia. Too close a story line to be a coincidence and maybe a better plot than the ABBA vehicle. Both movies have a certain charm which dilutes the risque undertones. On balance, I prefer the Gina Lollobrigida outing, no offense Meryl! It would have been nice if the producers of Mamma Mia had given some credit to the forerunner.",1232064000,2,452,4.524390243902439
488951,5,6302641934,"BUONA SERA MRS. CAMPBELL is a pleasant comedy directed by the experienced Melvin Frank in the late sixties.  It tells the story of an orphaned Italian girl who gets pregnant after giving shelter, in little less than a month, to three American GIs during the last days of the war.

To preserve her good name, and not knowing who the father of her baby really is, she goes to Florence to give birth and returns to her small town as widow of a certain Captain Campbell, naming her fictitious husband after the soup she was given to eat by her young American soldier-lovers.  She then proceeds to ask each one of them - who have no idea of one another' s existence - to give her child support. Twenty years later, the soldiers return, with wives and children, to dedicate a chapel to the town' s people.  And they are eager to meet their beautiful former ragazza Carla and ""their"" daughter, Gia.

This is a warm, old-fashioned, sentimental film, utterly unpretentious in spite of its first-rate cast.  The humor is often heavy-handed but that this does not keep the action from being genuinely entertaining.  The actors are great. Phil Silvers, Shelley Winters, Telly Savalas, Lee Grant, Peter Lawford, Marian Moses, Janet Margolin, Naomi Stevens, and Philippe Leroy  contribute a great deal to the success of the film.  Silvers and Winters are especially funny.  But this film belongs to Gina Lollobrigida.  At 40, she still shows why she became a legend of  world cinema.  She won the David di Donatello Award as Best Actress of the year for her lighthearted comic performance in this film.  She deserved it.

It is high time this comedy be released in DVD format in the US.  The same can be said of other Lollobrigida films, such as HOTEL PARADISO and WOMAN OF STRAW.",1226102400,8,1766,4.685064935064935
488952,5,6302641934,"This 40 year ""young"" movie is just top, top, top. The beauty and talent of Gina and  the humour of Telly Savallas are unbeatable. The recent movie ""Mamma Mia""  with Meryl Streep  is just a poor imitation of this one.",1225756800,,216,4.35

So when I heard then and now with the new Mama Mia Movie coming out this week, how the 'writer/creator' of MM is being praised, I was thinking that the story was actually stolen without credit being given to the writer of this 1968 film.

Phil Silvers plays the perfect schnook being married to Shelley Winters in the film, and being one of the three former ""comforting"" soldiers who was with lovely Gina Lolabrigida during the war.
