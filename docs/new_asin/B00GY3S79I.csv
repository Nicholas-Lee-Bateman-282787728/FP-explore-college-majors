6124066,4,B00GY3S79I,"""Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water"" is one of those shows that could have achieved true greatness if not for a serious crippling flaw. It starts out with great promise: a Jules Verne-inspired epic which, in a way, feels like an extension of Hayao Miyazaki's CASTLE IN THE SKY (incidentally, the master created the concept for this show, and basically recycled that for his 1986 masterpiece), filled with humor, drama, young love, friendship, moving moments, adventure, danger, and mystery. Incidentally, the series is based on ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"", as a good portion of the show (episodes 4, 9-22) sets on a submarine which just happens to be called ""Nautilus"", and yes, it's commanded by Captain Nemo. ""Nadia"" offers a rich tapestry of compelling characters, from the decidedly comic Grandis trio (who start off as bad guys, then become heroes), the captain and his crew, and the children protagonists who propel the story. In fact, much of the focus is about the growing friendship (and yes, romance) between Jean and Nadia, two orphans from different worlds brought together in unusual circumstances and forced to face situations that are very unfamiliar to them. Both are also of different personalities:  he is sweet-natured, brilliant (read:  adorkably nerdy), caring, eager to please, and overwhelmingly genial, while she is introverted, distrusting, emotionally troubled, and sometimes impulsively bad tempered.  (This can sometimes make the latter a very alienating character, but on the other hand, another focal point of the show is Nadia's growth into a more stable, trusting adult on account of Jean's loyalty and compassion.)  All of this is underscored by great animation (for a TV show) and memorable bits of action and drama.

All of this should have made ""Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water"" a classic series, but sadly, it misses the mark for one fatal flaw: it is much too long, clocking in at 39 episodes. And a good third of these half-hours (subtitled by fans as the ""infamous island episodes"", although the better term is island/Africa) are absolutely useless. But don't blame Gainax for episodes 23-34; the real problem was that backing distributor NHK requested them to be made -- the show was supposed to be a 27-30 episode series, but better-than-expected ratings prompted said filler arc. Unlike episodes 1-22 or the climactic 35-39, episodes 23-34 turn a compelling sci-fi epic into a nonsensical, poorly animated, haphazardly directed and written, unimaginative, unengaging, unpleasant mess that feels more like a bad Looney Tunes cartoon on drugs than anything else. The characters become caricatures of themselves (Nadia herself, in particular, regresses into a completely unlikeable brat), the idiotic, slapstick-oriented stories are absolutely devoid of any adventure, substance, and, most damaging of all, ultimately sabotage the momentum of the first 22 episodes. With the exception of episodes 30 and 31 (which even director Hideaki Anno would have salvaged if he was given the choice of eliminating the filler), the rest in the filler arc have absolutely no reason to exist. None.

Now don't take this as a meaning that ""Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water"" is a bad show. On the contrary. Its characters, as mentioned, are compelling, the core storyline is interesting and labyrinthine, and as long as it is focused on adventure and mystery it is indeed deserving of praise. It's just too bad that it suffers from an unfortunate filler arc; without it ""Nadia"" would have been a classic. To truly appreciate the show, it is recommended to watch the show like this: episodes 1-22, 30, 31, and 35-39. Although the missing gaps may seem jarring, take it from me, it's better than sitting through episode after episode of discouraging nonsense that negatively impact one's enjoyment of the show. Even Gainax agrees that it plays better this way.

In spite of my misgivings with ""Nadia"", though, I personally have no qualms with the English dub provided by Monster Island. The characters are all excellently cast and give splendid, lively performances. The voices of the children in particular are spot-on: Meg Bauman (13), Nathan Parsons (12), and Margaret Cassidy (11) as Nadia, Jean, and Marie, respectively, are what really drive the dub's heart, providing it with an intangible feeling of realism that really enhances the characters onscreen. For inexperienced youngsters, they do outstanding jobs, and the chemistry between all three is terrific (some may have trouble with Jean's shaky French accent, but I thought it was very appropriate and fitting for his character). The Grandis gang, too, is excellently cast, and have electrifying chemistry. ""Nadia""'s dub has taken a lot of undeserved flak from critics who have made the mistake of writing off the dub on account of the sometimes uneven accents, but beneath it lies a spirited, energetic, emotionally charged dub that really brings its characters to life.  It is most certainly a very commendable effort that deserved better recognition than what it was accorded for back in 2001 and even today.

Out of curiosity, I did sample a few episodes of the Japanese version.  Although some voices are solid (Nemo, Gargoyle, and Sanson), I felt rather indifferent about the others.  Marie's voice is the weakest of the bunch; no offense to the late Yuko Mizutani, but I feel Margaret Cassidy does a far better job of bringing out this little girl's innocence as opposed to Yuko's high-pitched shrieking.  Likewise, despite Yoshino Takamori and Noriko Hidaka's solid turns as Jean and Nadia I found myself preferring Bauman and Parsons, if mainly because both characters are supposed to be children.  It just feels more natural to hear them voiced by actors of the appropriate age.  Despite insistence from some long-in-the-tooth fans that this show should only be appreciated in its native language track, I don't consider either version better or worse, only different.  Whichever one you prefer is a matter of personal preference.

The Blu Ray set by Sentai Filmworks, too, deserves a shout out, mostly in the visual department.  The DVDs by ADV weren't BAD, visually, and had a rich serving of extras on the latter discs, particularly (text) interviews with the dub cast.  However, the video quality is simply superior to those of the DVDs.  The colors are very vivid and rich with detail, although some of the latter episodes suffer from some specks and occasional film scratches, but that's more on account of the poorer quality of the island/Africa episodes in general.  Still, this is the best the series has ever looked.  Apparently the production crew went back to the original 35mm negatives to provide better visual results, and it shows.  Even the DVDs never looked this good.  It would have been nice if the DVD extras were ported over, and sadly there isn't much in the way of new material other than two television spots.

This is about as compact a collection as you'll probably ever get from a show as beloved as ""Nadia"", and I do generally recommend the show overall, but be warned, the lead character can be hard to deal with at times and there is a pointless filler arc that falls flat on its face.",1409529600,19,7209,5.074387151310228

6124068,4,B00GY3S79I,"Every once in a while, an anime rerelease comes along that reminds audiences what sets the anime medium apart from others. Nadia: Secret of Blue Water is one such series despite how its clearly dated in both its art and effects, but Sentai has done well in restoring it for this Blu-ray release.

The series is great for fans of Miyazaki films who don't mind darker and more mature undertones. The director of the series, Hideaki Anno (of the Evangelion franchise), was likely influenced by Miyazaki because he worked for Miyazaki in the production of Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, and fans of Miyazaki's Nausicaa will find another strong heroine in Nadia. One key distinction, though, is that a 39 episode series had greater opportunity to more fully develop Nadia.  Anno has a knack for showing the complexities of humans and relationships, and, simply put, he is great at convincing audiences to like characters for their good attributes and, ultimately, love them for their very human flaws.

Fans of Evangelion will also enjoy the similarities between Eva and Nadia. Quite frankly, the crew of the Nautilus, at times, feels more akin to ""NERV in a submarine"" (even down to the uniforms), and those who were able to screen Evangelion 3.33 You Can(Not) Redo will be treated to some select musical scores throughout the series that sound oddly familiar.

All in all, whether you're a fan of Hideaki Anno, Evangelion, Miyazaki, or anime in general, this series is a quality work that tells a complete heartfelt human story with a balance of action, drama, humor, and romance that leaves a satisfying conclusion.",1394928000,19,1618,4.915750915750916
6124069,4,B00GY3S79I,I'm not going to spoil the show for anyone but this is one of my favorite anime series I have the old Dvd box sets that came with the soundtrack and movie. This is a great show to invest your time and money into it's 39 episodes long and while it has aged (it IS an old anime series) it is incredibly good if you have ever seen Castle in the Sky well Nadia is a bit like that movie but with some interesting twists and turns. There is fan service but it doesn't warrant a warning sign to keep the kids away because they weren't made to be perverted.  This is TV 14 so anyone wanting to get this for little kids might want to rethink it. I'm taking one star off for the fact that they left the movie out of it. As far as extras I just want the series I could care less about packing the soundtrack in with it (I already have it) as it is pretty expensive if they added the soundtrack to it I wouldn't be able to buy it like most of the series that comes out from Aniplex USA that are packed with a bunch of stuff I don't want nor need. Thank you Sentai for releasing this classic I hope you release the movie sometime in the future.,1393891200,19,1131,3.960526315789474
6124070,3,B00GY3S79I,"This is a decent release by Sentai Filmworks, but one wonders how much better it could have been if more time was invested in it.
The release seems like a half- baked  release on Sentai's part.

First off, the series is 39 episodes long  spaced across 5 blu-ray discs, with 9 episodes per disc.  Interestingly, the fifth blu-ray disc  has the final  3 episodes on it, which is totally unacceptable from an episode count point of view.  The episodes could have been spaced out much better across the 5 discs.  Because of that,  some of the images look a little soft on some of the episodes, and one wonders if too many episodes were crammed on the first 4 discs.

Another issue with this set is there are no extras whatsoever.  Even the old dvd releases had the motion picture movie included, plus the CD soundtracks...this release has nothing in terms of extras.

Do I recommend this set?  If you are a fan of the show yes, however,  if you are a first time watcher, then no.  Its high price and lack of extras isn't enough to warrant a purchase.",1393804800,18,1046,4.431578947368421

6124080,3,B00GY3S79I,"Nadia Secret of the Blue Water is an anime series by the animation studio Gainax with the director being none other than the great Hideaki Anno who is most famous for Neon Genesis Evangelion. The series was originally meant for the direct Hayao Miyazaki and you can tell. The series seems very Ghibli but it still has that Gainax charm. It was one of Gainax's first work so you can't expect it to be perfect. This series has romance, comedy, action, and adventure so what's not to love here. The series is about a young boy who is an inventor who meets a young girl named Nadia who has a mysterious jewel who three villians want to take. The series makes you care about the characters and how couldn't you after all you've been through with them. My only complaints with the series is that the animation isn't all that great but it was 1990 so you have to give them credit. My other complaint is that the series felt to long with 39 episodes and it gets dragged out along the way with you wishing for it to get the point which would make it better as a movie.",1436486400,,1059,4.3

6124082,5,B00GY3S79I,"This is an adventure that is on a grand scale, starts off in France with poor Nadia being chased by thieves who want her necklace, but is saved by Jean whose in Paris with his uncle to enter in a contest for flying contraptions. Nadia and her pet baby lion ,King,and Jean begins an epic global journey to protect her and to find out why everyone wants her necklace, The Blue Water. I bought this when it first came out on DVD from ADV, the collectors box Collection 1 and 2 edition. Fantastic show, I watched the whole thing several times and never gotten tired of it. There are times in some of the action scenes (chase) that reminds me of those Indiana Jones movies.
 If you have it on DVD, there's really no need to buy the Blu-ray, unless your trying to slim down your collection for room. Sound is still in 2.0 digital and the screen aspect  ratio 4:3 on dvd is the same as 1.33.1 on Blu-ray.

6124083,3,B00GY3S79I,"Sometimes this series really surprises me on how progressive it was for the era. Mostly in the first 15 episodes.

Other times it strikes me as sort of middle of the range, typical kinds or flaws to others. Mostly the last few episodes.

There were a number right after the half way point that made me want to find something else to do. Frustrating filler and poorly executed plot, animation, dialog, and most of all directing.

Watch this series if you feel you can weather through to the little nuggets of goodness. Or don't.",1423526400,2,527,4.585106382978723
8628588,5,B00GY3S79I,"I wish I could give this one more than 5 stars. This is one of the oft forgotten masterpieces. The thing a true master of his craft does just before he gets famous. Hidieaki Anno is one of Japans current greatest film makers. Now being a master of both anime and live action. He made the recent 2 part Attack on Titan live action movie with Toho. He made the awesome and award winning Shin Godzilla that took Japan byu storm last year. Before that he is best known for making Neon Genesis Evangelion. The Robot Anime that changed anime the way George Lucas's Star Wars changed Hollywood.

Nadia The Secret of Blue Water is the show that he made just before Evangelion. And it is WONDERFUL!!! It is a Victorian Industrial era tale. Based very very loosely on the works of Jules Verne. At the 1889 Paris Worlds faire a young inventor and aspiring aviator meets a mysterious dark skinned young girl. She is from the circus, and seem to be being chased by a trio of international jewel thieves. And thus begins a wild steampunk adventure into the depths of the world of Jules Verne and the mind of Hidieaki anno. Atlantis, Nemo, The Nautilus, Robar, The Master of the World, The Mysterious Island. All are referenced in unexpected ways, as our young adventurers, their clumsy thieves, are swept along with the crew of Captain Nemo to face a threat to the very world.

It is 2 seasons 39 episodes. Layered with deep complex characters and stories. The show starts off simple. You feel like you are watching a generic western cartoon. 2 kids have a jewel. A trio of goofy thieves is chasing them through various adventures to get it. But that's just the known starting point. As soon as you re recognizing that, things get turned on their heads as both the simple characters and simple story that you thought you were watching opens up and you slowly start to get a feel for what lies ahead. The first two episodes feel like an American Afterschool cartoon from the 90's. If you can make it through them your mind will start getting blown. And remarkably it does this without getting too dark. While the threats are grin and terifying and real, they manage to maintain a balance of upbeat character with the kids. And it is just a wonderful story. It's the truest form of a Steampunk adventure story.

It is also a fairly accesible story, For an anime there is not a lot of fanservice, beyond Nadia's acrobat outfit. (which plays into some character development) The show is appropriate for kids 9-10 and up with parental guidance. 11-12 and up should be fine on there own.

Like I said the show is amazing. A must watch for anime fans, It's the show that a great director perfected his craft, and got every single thing right, before moving on to bigger things. If you are a fan of Evangelion you will like this better. Certainly you will like the voice dub better. The show is near perfection, It's worth hunting down in any format before it disapears again. Also if you are a fan of The Last Exile, you will love this show Last Exile pulls alot from here.

This is a Grand Adventure. It is a true must see for anime fans.",1522627200,,3118,4.492063492063492

8628593,5,B00GY3S79I,"It was the summer of 2013 that I discovered ""Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water"" on YouTube, before the website got strict on what they allow to stream shows & films and started to charge what was popular to watch or slightly alter visual and hearing from how it was suppose to be [a close-up or high squeaky voices]. For an anime series that was made since I was about seven months old [made in 1990], it was worth watching. It may have not be as popular as Dragon Ball, Pokemon, or Gundam, but Nadia does deserve some recognition for it brilliance and excellence. For starters, its loosely based on Jules Verne's ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"". While the series has original characters like Nadia (a young African acrobat with a mysterious past), Jean (a young French inventor who falls in love with Nadia), Marie (a little girl who joins our young protagonists after tragedy) and a trio of criminals turned allies - The Grandis Gang (former wealthy heiress Grandis Granvan, head strong sharp shooter Sanson, and the brilliant yet pudgy mechanic Hanson....these three seem like the prototype for Team Rocket's Jesse and James), and the villainous Gargoyle and his legion of followers the Neo Atlanteans, Captain Nemo and his submarine The Nautilus are always handy in the realm of public domain, especially when this series provides science-fiction origins between the Captain and Nadia in an alternate universe of the late 19th century (some even refer this series as steampunk).
 Another interesting thing about this anime series is that it WAS originally an idea that the great anime film director Hayao Miyazaki. True story. One you will have to look up on your own time. Take my word for it. Also, the animation for this show was done by the same man behind ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" - Hideaki Anno.
 One of my personal reasons why I like this anime series is that I find it rare to see both a woman of color to be a protagonist in an anime series AND interracial romance is also rare to see in anime as well. When you watch the show from beginning to end, in all 39 episodes, Jean and Nadia's relationship is one of the themes of the show. Boy meets girl, boy loves girl, girl can be frustrating and boy tries to put up with it, girl eventually opens up to boy, boy and girl figure out her past, boy tries to protect girl, and eventually they have a happy ending. Its a good show if you like old school anime before 21st century anime shows. It has adventure, excitement, thrills, mecha, love, and humor. Overall, you not regret Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water.
