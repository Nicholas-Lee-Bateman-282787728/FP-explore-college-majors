8091783,1,B000BSFK06,"Not very interesting.  This dvd consists of two films.  The first is the best.  It shows trains stopping in small towns in Appalachia throwing candy to kids at Christmas.  Also some snow scenes of trains.  Very little is actually Christmas oriented.  The second film came from Maryland Public Television.  If you're a local, you might enjoy it.  Much of film is devoted to a miniature train at the Baltimore Zoo--boring stuff.  Save your money.",1489363200,,444,4.891891891891892

8091787,5,B000BSFK06,"We are taking my 5 year old on a Christmas/Santa train ride in a week, so I got this video to prep him for the trip.  Boy, it sure did the trick!  He loves trains anyway, but this video was very well done.  It includes some narration and several holiday music tracks to help get you in the mood.  There are shots of Santa trains; lots of steam trains; plenty of snow plows; diesel trains pulling passangers and freight.  In the first part of the video the trains are mostly back east, in the mid-west and Canada.  However, the best part for me (since I'm from California) was the bonus footage at the end with vintage steam trains running in the west: Utah, Colorado and Nevada...all without any music or narration, just the train sounds...very cool!  Will be getting other train DVDs from this company now.",1260662400,5,807,4.486301369863014
