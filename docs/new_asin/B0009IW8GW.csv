8061480,5,B0009IW8GW,"I must start off by saying I give each film 2 and half stars,hence the 5 star rating.

The copies I viewed were screener copies.

Both films are Indonesian productions.

Hell Hole looks like it's from the 1970's early `80's.

Lots of near nude scenes of girls being beaten in some way,shape or form.

Full screen version. Quality is not bad.

Jungle Virgin Force is widescreen and is one bizarre ride!

Lots of red stuff throughout and the best dubbing this side of a mushroom trip.

It's widescreen and the film combo fits oddly enough.

The covers are stunning and obviously a tribute to the old comics of the 60's and 70's.

The bonus features are zero and they actually poke fun at that with such descriptions as `stiff as a corpse unanimated menus' which is pretty funny actually.

The price(under 10 dollars) more than justifies getting these very hard to find titles.",1126569600,9,874,4.647058823529412
