8019739,3,B00020X93I,"The two animations on this DVD by Aleksey (Alex) Budovsky are weird and wonderful, and not to be missed. They are both videos for weird and wonderful songs by ""The (Real) Tuesday Weld"". As far as I can tell, this is the only DVD with any of Budovsky's animation. He has a few more on his website (Figli-Migli Productions). The two Budovsky titles on this DVD are ""Bathtime in Clerkenwell"" and ""Terminally Ambivalent Over You"".

The two Plympton titles are old favorites, and there are a couple other good titles on this disk. The rest ranges from forgettable to unwatchable.

I very highly recommend the Budovsky titles to anyone who loves weird and wonderful animation. But plan on skipping through most of the other titles on this disk.",1294358400,,738,4.7578125
8019740,5,B00020X93I,"If you're a fan of edgy animation, I highly recommend

Avoid Eye Contact. This collection of shorts was

created by the talents of independent animators Jesse

Schmal, Patrick Smith, Fran Krause, Signe Baumane,

Bill Plympton, PES, Aleksey Budovsky, John Dilworth,

Michael Overbeck, Geroge Griffin, and John Schnall.

Each film adds a unique touch to the mix and the end

product is a brilliant anthology. Incredibly funny and

visually inventive.",1157673600,,448,5.391304347826087
8019741,5,B00020X93I,"This is a great collection of shorts, a wonderful addition to my animation library. This DVD puts independent animation within its' own context. These films are usually very difficult to ever see once they are out of the festival circuit.  Bill Plympton and Patrick Smith are well represented with some of their best work included.  John Dilworth is also well represented with one of his better shorts.

I highly recomend this item!!  Can't wait to see what will be put on volume 2!!  some material is strictly for adults.",1112486400,2,522,4.820224719101123
