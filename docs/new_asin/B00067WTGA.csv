2174244,5,B00067WTGA,"We bought this DVD for my not-quite 2-year-old son, Caleb, who is enamoured with tractors.  He LOVES it!  He has watched it almost daily since we got it a few months ago, and it often holds him mesmerized for the whole 40 minutes (a marvel for a toddler).  You don't have to be a toddler to enjoy it, though...my husband and I found it quite entertaining (for the first dozen or so times we saw it, anyway), and Caleb's grandpa was also impressed.

The video is very well done, with great footage of a wide variety of new and vintage John Deere tractors and implements.  Learn about a variety of historic ""Johnny Popper"" 2-cylinder tractors (probably our favorite part of the video).  Also see the newest 4-wheel drive BIG tractors.  John Deere construction equipment is also shown, with a detailed segment on excavators (a.k.a. ""diggers"").  Also includes the ""Buck"" (John Deere ATV) and ""Gator"" (basically a golf cart for the farm).  Interspersed throughout the video are catchy tunes with which you will find yourself singing along, as well as humorous clips that run in reverse...see a combine spit the harvest back out, a tractor ""un-plow"" a field, and more.

This video is sure to please your wheel-loving youngster, and you may be pleasantly surprised to find yourself learning more about tractors than you had bargained for...and having fun while you're at it!  I'd give this video more than 5 stars if I could...it truly is that good.",1131667200,45,1442,4.797570850202429
2174245,5,B00067WTGA,"I purchased both part 1 and part 2 for my two year old for his birthday. He loves tractors and any big equipment. He loves these movies. I can honestly say that I have no problem watching them either. He will tell me what the tractors are doing, and what color they are. He has so much fun. He is even learning the songs from the movies and likes to hum along with them. I would suggest these to anyone whose little guy or girl loves equipment! They are fun for all ages!",1130371200,2,471,4.075268817204301
2174246,5,B00067WTGA,"We recently purchased this DVD for our three year old son who is obsessed with John Deere tractors.  He watches it over and over again until we can't take it anymore.  The songs are catchy and you will find yourself humming along even if you don't mean to.  If you have a child who loves John Deere, then this is a perfect DVD for them.",1129593600,4,336,4.138461538461539
2174247,5,B00067WTGA,My 20 month old loves tractors.  He actually has no interest in television and we weren't sure if he would actually watch this.  But when it arrived we were pleased to see he loved it.  The video is fun and educational and makes our son so happy.  The songs are cute too.  A pleasure to watch for the whole family.,1128124800,2,314,4.166666666666667
2174248,5,B00067WTGA,"My 15 month old son LOVES this movie!  He points at the TV and says ""tract""  ""tract""  everytime he hears it coming on.  He will sit absolutely still and watch every minute of it while I get the kitchen cleaned up, it's great!  My husband likes it too, so they watch it together.  The songs are the best, he clapps his hands and squeals!  I can't wait for vol 2!",1127260800,2,361,4.071428571428571
2174249,5,B00067WTGA,"This DVD came in a batch that I bought, as an extra.  I really thought 'what am I going to do with a tractor video' so I was going to try to sell it.  My husband suggested that I let my 2 year old son watch it before we get rid of it.  Well, that was it, he wanted to watch it over and over and over.....(so did my husband - who thanks God, cause this is one of the few videos that he doesn't mind watching 5 times in a row).  I don't think my son is old enough to understand what they are talking about on the video, so I guess it's all the tractors and stuff that interest him. It has catchy toons, a bunch of tractors running up and down farmsv, and tells the history of the John Deere tractors - I don't see the hype (but I'm a city girl so what do I know about tractors).  The important thing is that my son really loves this video and when he is driving me absolutely crazy I ask if he would like to see the John Deere video, then I start singing 'John Deere, make America proud, John Deere .....""  It works EVERY time.  If your child loves cars and trains GET THIS (trust me).",1126224000,7,1083,3.8954545454545455
2174250,4,B00067WTGA,A great dvd which we casn't wait until volume 2 comes out.  The tractors are great and we must have watched this video 5 times in a row.

2174251,5,B00067WTGA,"My 18 month old LOVES anything with wheels or makes loud noise.  After my husband purchased a John Deere tractor to cut our lawn my son became sooo obsessed with tractors.  So I purchased this DVD and he would watch it all day if we let him.  He wakes up saying, ""brrrmmm, brrrmmm..."" asking to watch it.  It's a sweet video aimed at children and is quite enjoyable.  Wonderful for any brrmmm brrrmmm obsessed little ones!",1120953600,3,422,4.5

2174279,3,B00067WTGA,"The picture quality looks like it is a second or third generation copy from VHS. The kid narrator is grating and insincere. The songs are annoying and will pop into your head when you are mowing the lawn. I give it one star. However, my 2-year old son thinks this is the best video ever, and he is quite forceful in his opinions. So five stars from him.",1415404800,,353,4.205882352941177

My son, who is just starting to sing, will sing a lot of the songs from this video. I originally bought this for a road trip but we have watched it at least 100 times over since our trip last June.

Not everything accurate for all areas of farming, but regions of the country do have to do things differently depending on soil, and this is, after all, not newly produced. Have ordered several in the series.  Great for little farmers...and good for adults who have to/get to watch it with them!",1408060800,,445,4.402439024390244

2174293,5,B00067WTGA,"A city-boy whose family moved to a rural area when I was just a teenager, I had the privilege of becoming participating in the daily lives of farmers! One of the fondest memories i have is of the mostly good-natured disagreements among  fellow farmers claiming superiority for the tractor(s) of their choice.

It was my good-fortune to have as my best friend in high school, a guy whose father had two John Deere tractors of the early-year, two-cylinder ""Johnny Popper"" variety. These early John Deeres and, of course, some later ones, are showcased in this fun  DVD.

My wife, knowing my cherished bias in this critical area, bought a copy of this DVD at a yard sale. After watching it, I bought copies for each of my sons, to have and to show to their children.

If this is a subject of any interest to you, I would recommend taking a look at one of these (there is a set, of four, I think). Incidentally, they're not purely 'juvenile.' There's some serious information of the educational type in these DVDs.",1403913600,,1010,4.588888888888889

A kid narrates the movie and tells what an auction is, different farm equipment and their uses, shows 4 wheelers and deer. My grandson repeats each name of the equipment after the person who is narrating it and states ""I like 4 wheelers"" every time the movie shows them. He shouts deer when they show a picture of a buck. There's really not much to this movie but he absolutely loves it! It is actual people and equipment not cartoons.",1398643200,,524,4.412371134020619

Just a warning....the songs are very addictive and will be stuck in your head for days.  There is a lot in it that will be over a kids head and much of it is an advertisement.  The last 10 minutes of the video is an advertisement by the producers of the video for many of their other videos.  I didn't care for the amount of advertising in it but then again, 90% of the TV shows I watch were ones I recorded on my DVR so I could fast-forward commercials.",1392163200,,574,4.0

I read a previous review of someone who was also dissatisfied with this part of the movie.  I also ordered the fourth movie.  The narrator does not scold the tractor on that movie.

2174327,1,B00067WTGA,I bought this DVD for my son as a gift for his 4th birthday. He loves tractors so he was excited to open it up and run to the DVD player to view it. The DVD skipped all over the place and you could barely hear the audio much less see the pics. I sent it back and paid to ship it back. Today in the mail I received an Amazon gift card for $7.55. I'm sorry but this is unacceptable business practices!! I paid $12.00 and some change for the DVD and then another $2.40 to send it back and all I'm compensated is $7.55. Since when is it my fault that the DVD was bad to start with then I don't even get back the full amount that I paid for the DVD. This seller is a joke and I encourage anyone that reads this review to NOT buy anything from them. Your business/company is RIDICULOUS and a total joke!!!!!,1343347200,,801,3.950617283950617
