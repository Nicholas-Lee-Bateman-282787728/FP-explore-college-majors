5856678,4,B00DUJBVQA,"Very interesting show. Selma, the computer-credit card, was visionary, and the acting is not bad at all. The show looks a bit dated now but that can't really be helped. If you want to see where the iPhone and Apple Watch are going, you need to see this show.",1445126400,,258,4.285714285714286
5856679,5,B00DUJBVQA,"In the second season, the show hits its stride.  The episodes are more smoothly put together; the action is less haphazard.  The disks, created on demand, were as described, and look pretty much like any purchased DVDs.  The screen images are sharp and clear.  Unfortunately, there are no extras.",1440892800,,296,4.979591836734694

5856691,5,B00DUJBVQA,"I absolutely loved this show since it first came on in the early 90's, along with ""Kung Fu the Legend Continues"" back to back.  The show reminds me of the young adult ""Tom Swift"" series, where a intrepid swashbuckling young hero engages with advanced techno gadgets, and space age sci fi weaponry to fight the villain of the week.

Hero space age cop from the future beams to the present to hunt down evil criminals from his own time, and bring them back to his era for justice.  He is stuck in what is his past but our present trying to survive and get by with the help of a trusty hologram credit card.

 A more mature adult rip off of this series was made into a ""Van Damn"" film called ""Timcop"" with virtually the same exact plot, just rated R.  Science fiction is my bread and butter, and if you are a fan of ""Star Wars"", ""Star Trek"", ""Highlander"", ""Indiana Jones"" ect or if you may recall William Shatner's series ""Tekwar"" you will probably really like this show and find it worth your time and money.

 I liked how they mixed the gun play action with stunts, and martial arts.

 It was too bad that the series did not last beyond it's second season.  Looking forward to Hollywood maybe one day bringing this franchise back to life in the form of a film for the modern 21st Century because it had a great concept.

Thumbs way up for this one.",1421366400,3,1347,4.322709163346613
5856692,5,B00DUJBVQA,"After all these years ""remembering"" it, it was great to actually see the episodes again.  Like seeing them for the first time.  An all around fun sci-fi tv show to watch.",1418601600,,170,4.451612903225806

5856696,5,B00DUJBVQA,"Great fun! I have enjoyed this series more than when I first saw it in the 1990s.  I wish it had lasted longer than 2 years.  It has action and adventure, but is family-friendly--no bad language, violence is minimal, and the characters are appealing. I'm grateful to be able to own it.  I highly recommend it!",1406592000,,309,4.482142857142857
5856697,5,B00DUJBVQA,Buy it..Be sure to put this in your collection and it will be an all time favorite to watch....Dale Midkiff is a good actor.,1399852800,2,124,4.208333333333333
5856698,5,B00DUJBVQA,Must watch show worth purchase lots of action and storys keep u watching and wanting more worth time to watch.,1399334400,,110,4.55
5856699,5,B00DUJBVQA,"This is a continuation from the first season.  It is better and has more fun and action in it, especially that Darien cannot be bought no matter what the bribe is and that Selma becomes more like a person that a machine.  I also like that Darien learns about where he really came from and who he really is.  The only thing that I did not like is that there were not more seasons made of this series especially seeing Darien catch Mordicai Sahmbi and send him back so that he could go back home.  I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in science fiction especially about the future.",1396656000,7,594,4.324324324324325

5856701,5,B00DUJBVQA,As good as it ever was. Everyone needs an assistant in a credit card. Wish I had one to keep me inside my credit limit!,1393027200,2,119,3.8
5856702,1,B00DUJBVQA,"...Ten or so years ago I pitched a TV idea called Time Trax (or 'Tracks') to a famous independent  producer at 20th Century Fox. Trax is not from 20th. But here's an amazing coincidence: My pitch (with TV director David Orr) and this Trax are virtually the same every aspect. My details were explicit.

I really like this concept and its producer's totally fine job. If my name was on Trax it'd be Five Stars from me. I filed my treatment with Writer's Guild; I wonder if it's still filed there?  This Trax's credits don't list the producer we pitched to. He's famous now (No names, Hollywood heavies have Hollywood lawyers). After so much time, retired by 40,flew to Tahiti and on. I'm now 73. I've had a good life Maybe better because of this twist. So coincidence aside, I'm okay, fine, afloat, happy. But maybe there are lessons for writers in this quick take.

Amazon Review Guidelines coincidentally allow me latitude here. I repeat: this TIME TRAX
has a fine concept and execution. If you like Sci-Fi action adventures, you'll like it.
Whoever created and wrote the initial concept should be proud. Coincidentally, I am, remotely.  rc",1392768000,2,1141,4.742424242424242
5856703,4,B00DUJBVQA,"the series is very good and I love it therefore 5 stars for the series.
But the DVD are not pressed they are just burned DVDs and this is for me just 3 stars worth, since burned DVDs are more sensible and do not last as long.",1392076800,,225,3.8085106382978724
5856704,5,B00DUJBVQA,"Each week Darian Lambert searches out criminals from the future hiding out in our time. He is armed with a credit card that houses a powerful computer which helps holographic image Darian search out threats to the present. Could be made better with todays CGI.
an would make a great remake. Even so love the show.",1390089600,,313,4.607142857142857

5856709,5,B00DUJBVQA,I like good science fiction.  I especially enjoy shows with Time travel as part of the show plot.  Each week it is interesting to see which bad guy he will run into & send forward to his century.  Lambert has a pleasing personality & he along with Selma are enjoyable to watch interacting together.  I look forward to each episode.,1379116800,,331,4.466666666666667
5856710,5,B00DUJBVQA,"I loved it when it was originally on television. I wish that they had made a couple of more episodes and then showing that Darien had to go home. Then he would be with those he loved. It would been a great ending, showing a closing to the series with hope that Darien would live a happy life with someone he loved, like the nice doctor at one of the final shows.",1378944000,,362,4.041666666666667
5856711,4,B00DUJBVQA,"Not too many people even know of this show since it was on the ill fated Prime Time Entertainment Network.
The second season, like the first season is a bare bones set. There are no extras or bonus material. The liner notes are pretty sparce
also. The picture quality is good.
So for all the rest of you Time Trax fans whoever you are, this is a must!",1378080000,,351,4.176470588235294

5856713,5,B00DUJBVQA,"This dvd boxset of Time Trax season 2  was long awaited, and the wait was well worth it...the video and audio quality of the season 2 episodes is very good,  and  fans of this short lived series from 1993 and 1994 will appreciate it....the dvd boxset is well done,  just like the season 1 boxset....

8597962,5,B00DUJBVQA,"I thought I had watched both seasons of Time Trax, but most of the second season is unfamiliar to me, so it was nice to get this and to watch more.

Yes, there is no resolution regarding Dr Sambie, but, personally, I'm glad that he was in less of the shows; I thought he was in too many of the 1st season shows.

I think I like season #2 better than season #1; I remember in season #1 that there was more profanity (not terribly lurid, but more I didn't like it - in fact, that may be why I never watched season #2).  However, maybe I'm just forgetting things, but I haven't noticed this as much in season #2.

One nice touch is that one of the shows references the TRAX janitor from season #1.

If you liked Time Trax, this is definitely the better season.",1468022400,,757,4.122448979591836
