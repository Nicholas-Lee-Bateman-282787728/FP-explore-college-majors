1689281,4,B0000639IZ,I purchased Back to the Secret Garden as a gift for my two nieces and they just love it. This is as good as the original and I would recommend it highly for adults and children alike.,1168300800,,183,3.972972972972973
1689282,4,B0000639IZ,"I love The Secret Garden and am happy I purchased and viewed this sequel.  It was difficult to accept a grouchy Martha, but I stayed with the story.  While this is not as good as the original (novel, stage play, movie), it was worth watching.  I am not sure, yet, that it is a ""keeper.""",1162512000,3,286,4.163636363636364

1689284,4,B0000639IZ,"I liked this sequal a good bit,but I think it lacks something. It doesn`t seem to have the magical Secret Garden touch to me! It`s worth seeing,but probably not buying! It`s not great,but it`s not horrible either!",1120608000,11,213,4.783783783783784
1689285,1,B0000639IZ,"this is by far the worst moive I've seen. I LOVE the first secret garden. No one can do a sequel to a moive as good as the origanl. It's a classic. But this sequel is terriable. It controdicts the first moive. It takes the magic away. If you liked the origanl, first moive don't watch this, it will take the magic out of the first moive.",1115510400,14,337,4.044776119402985

I'm from austria and here it's not possible to get this movie, because they didn't translate it. After this I by DVD's only in the original language because ther are much better, as you can see at ""BACK TO THE SECRET GARDEN"" If its possible this movie gets 10 STARS **********",1083456000,17,404,4.1265822784810124
1689287,5,B0000639IZ,"A great sequel to the many originals. It was great to see returning characters. Though the Garden may have shrunken a little if you're a fan of the Kate Maberly version, but the Magic is still there. When Miss Mary must leave Misstlethwait manor, the garden door disappears. Martha Sowerby, the house keeper, tries looks for it, but even with all the ivy covering it, she knows it's not there. No one knows why, but the Vibrance of the once gorgeous garden, is gone, and the plants are dying. But when a little orphan girl named Lizzie Buscana from America comes to live in the large orhanage, she realizes the garden needs her help. Dickon may not be here to help, but all by herself, Lizzie can bring back the magic just by using her own instincts. Martha, now much older, and wiser, starts to realize, that Lizzie may be the only one who can save the garden now. With a little help with some animal friends, a lot of tender loving care, and friendship, the kids of Misstlethwait can bring the garden back to life by just being themselves. It was a great adition to the secret garden collection. Some people say that the secret garden all by itself was fine, and that this movie wasn't needed, but watching this movie shows adults that kids need to play. In this case the garden wanted to be played in. Just sitting there in the middle of a field makes you feel alone. With the garden returning, and 5 star acting, you can make this another addition to your secret garden collection.",1059609600,34,1485,4.483394833948339
1689288,5,B0000639IZ,"I just saw this today on pay-per-view.  It's an absolute treasure of a movie.  Why do the Brits do so much better at children's movies than we do?  This has atmosphere, beautiful scenery, a talented cast, and is lovingly photographed.  What a joy to see David Warner in this; he is probably the most under-rated actor of the 20th century.  He is always believable, always a delight to see.  I certainly intend to buy this movie, and watch it again and again.  You will be drawn into this movie's wonderful universe at once, and never want to leave.  These days, we all need a little magic, and this movie is a powerhouse in the magic and charm departments.  When you've really arrived, you don't have to shout about it.  This movie speaks softly and carries a big stick.  A very delightful and welcome addition to any film library.  The color is ravishing.  I think that is why the Brits do better than we do; they understand visual impressions, sounds, colors, and children.",1025827200,62,975,4.598837209302325
1689289,5,B0000639IZ,"Back to the Secret Garden is a wonderfully done film.  And just for clarification, I gave five stars for the movie, not the DVD.  The DVD comes with only two options, Play and Scene selection.  It would be nice if it had some more options, but it's still more than worth it.
This movie has an excellent atmosphere to it.  And I didn't expect to see David Warner in it.  It really is to bad that its theatrical release was canceled.
Now what else can I saw about this movie?  Oh yes, it stars Camilla Belle.  Camilla is a very talented rising actress.  You may remember her from her small, yet important role in Jurassic Park 2.  She was the young girl attacked at the beginning of the movie.  Or you may have seen her staring in the Disney Channel movie, Rip Girls.  Had Back to the Secret Garden been released in theaters, as it was intended, it would have been Camilla's first staring role on the big screen.  And for that reason alone it is a pity that it went straight to TV.",1020297600,4,979,4.260869565217392
1689290,4,B0000639IZ,"This is a wonderful follow-up for anyone who loved the original Secret Garden. My girls ages 8&10 felt if they were revisiting old friends and a familiar place from their childhood. They loved looking for visual clues that tied into the original story and this movie delivered. They squealed with delight at Robin Red Breast, Mary, Colin and Martha's appearances. They sat on the edge of their seats to see what would become of the Secret Garden. Bravo! A job well done by the creators of this sequel.

1689308,5,B0000639IZ,"This is a great movie, worth ten stars just like ""The Secret Garden""

Our beloved child characters from the book (and first movie) are grown up. Mary Lennox is now the mistress of the manor, married to Colin, her cousin, who is now Ambassador to the United States. They have no children of their own, so have turned the manor into a loving orphanage.

Martha, the child servant from the earlier movie, is now the chief servant, running the manor and the orphanage. Her free-spirited brother died during the war.

As the movie starts, Mary is preparing to join her husband in the United States, and as part of getting treatment for a disabled child, arranges an orphan exchange with an orphanage in the United States that can help the English child with needed surgeries. Mary meets a child who, like herself, seems to love gardens even more than the people around her. She becomes the next child to come to the Secret Garden from across the ocean, just like Mary came across the ocean from India in the first movie.

Meanwhile, Martha, no longer the child she once was, either chronologically or at heart, cannot find her way into the garden. The key does not work for her. The door hides itself from her view, so she has her own door built into the wall.

Our new hero discovers the garden, discovers a friend who also loves the garden, learns more about herself, and eventually even convinces Martha that she is the right child to inherit the garden's responsibilities.

Jealousies do abound, but eventually everything works for the good of the garden, and the garden blossoms and grows, just as our characters blossom and grow.

I heartily recommend this movie to you. It will ""grow"" on you.",1459036800,,1694,4.6644295302013425
1689309,4,B0000639IZ,"I loved Camilla's performance and the story was like having the old 1993 charcters (Dikinson,Colin, and Mary) back. I still love young Mary, but Lizzie was a good option.",1458777600,,170,4.896551724137931

However, I would have liked to see a different outcome as to when they became adults.  I won't spoil it by going into detail here.  However, once the story begins with the new character, it is good, but not near as well told as ""The Secret Garden"".

What a genetic mess they would have been (in theory) as the movie was a mess (in reality).",1285718400,3,418,4.594594594594595

1689453,5,B0000639IZ,"This educator and Dad, when my daughter was little, would watch the original Secret Garden!  This later film extended my understanding of that first story.  As a matter of fact, my first novel being completed now, The Serpentine Bond!, has a bit of flavor about a secret garden for university students!",1262822400,,302,4.901960784313726
1689454,5,B0000639IZ,I loved the secret garden so I had to buy this. I wasn't disappointed at all. It's a great movie.,1260921600,,97,3.9
1689455,4,B0000639IZ,"I love movies with a hidden message. This one almost got by me, it is so subtle but when realized, so very clear.
I believe The Garden represents the Garden of Eden. When Mary leaves Martha in charge, Martha decides that the children should only be allowed in the Garden on Sunday, after church, and then only as a place to learn life's lessons by a very strict teacher, such as the proper etiquite for taking tea. All very boring to the children and even leading to a fight amongst them. The Garden begins to die.
The Secret Door is significant enough. ""Knock and it shall be opened"". The door is hidden but to only a few ""enlightned"" children and covered with a veil of ivy. The door is revealed to Lilly who becomes the keeper of the ""key"" and discovers
""within herself"", intuitively, the reason why the Garden is dying. She brings the children inside and as they begin playing, the Garden rejuvenates itself, flowers begin to bloom and it becomes alive once again.
In many eastern religions, it is believed that the world we see is nothing more than a dream (or nightmare) and the REAL world, as God created it, awaits us beyond the veil of this one. Wasn't the Garden of Eden originally created as a place for the children of God to ""play"" in love, peace and joy?
What a mess of things we have made! But all is not lost - the Garden awaits our Awakening. Since we are all One, it only takes one ""keeper of the key"" to open the door for all.
The movie was good and the message even more joyful.",1251331200,2,1498,4.334519572953736
1689456,5,B0000639IZ,Back to the Secret Garden is an excellent story for families. The video is well produced with clear audio and video. I recommend it for everyone.,1231286400,,145,4.615384615384615
1689457,1,B0000639IZ,"WOW! Ok, so if you know the story of the real secret garden DO NOT WATCH this! You will be very disturbed! I'm going to give two semi-spoilers,  but they are little facts that get revealed very early on in the movie.

1. Dickon is dead! And the best part is the he died in War! (b/c his character who loved every living thing would so go to war!)

2. As disturbing as Dickon's death is...it gets worse. There is also the relationship between cousins Mary and Colin-ya I spent half the movie trying to figure out if they were married. (Oh, I'm not kidding!) Ya apparently incest is the new secret of the garden!
And while I watched this a long time ago, and refuse to see it again, I'm still pretty sure that they were actually married. Mary Lennox's name is  Lady Mary Cravin according to IMDB.

So pretty much, either the writer, Steve Thompson, didn't read or watch the original OR he is an advocate of incest and thought no one would notice. The saddest part is that Frances Hodgson Burnett's name is attached to the movie because he created the characters. On the bright side he's not alive to see what they did to his work.",1227571200,5,1128,4.352380952380952

1689459,5,B0000639IZ,"throughly enjoyed this movie.  Sarah Hollis Andrews played the part well of Mary she is a wonderful actress.  The actors played all their parts well I thought Dickon was the perfect actor for this part and was how I imagined him to be in the book as were all the actors Colin, Martha etc.  I would rate this an excellent movie as I thought the story followed the book more.",1220572800,,373,4.3
1689460,1,B0000639IZ,"Have you ever seen a sequal to a movie and thought there was not really an opening for part two in the first one? Well this is one of those movies. I am not saying don't watch I am just saying if you liked the first one don't get you're hopes to high, it is nothing like it. I am not entirely sure why it is called back to the secret garden since the garden is no longer a secret but whatever.",1199232000,6,393,3.8048780487804876

7958977,5,B0000639IZ,yes this is a great family movie.  I liked it when i saw it on Netflix for the first time.  it arrived in a timely manner.  i am a secret garden fan for years.  i even had my own secret garden one time!,1495411200,,202,3.627906976744186

7958980,5,B0000639IZ,"I saw the original Secret Garden in the theaters and loved it. This sequel takes place years later and now you learn who she married and what happened to everyone in the first movie. The actors in this, adults and children, are very believable. The respect for the garden - the plants and the creatures -  is reaffirmed, making this a good film for children. But adults who saw the first one will enjoy this as well. Although the first movie cannot be topped, with its much bigger budget, this one has a lot of heart.",1487980800,,517,4.385416666666667
