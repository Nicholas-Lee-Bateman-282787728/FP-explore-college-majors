5551806,5,B00B1LM730,"My 9 and 7 year olds really liked these.  My 4 year old did too, but it was kind of scary for her.  They have a good amount of suspense and are appropriate and interesting.  The stories also got my kids interested in the times, and have given them a point of reference when we talk about history.  At the museum, I can say ""This would have been happening when Molly's story was happening,"" etc.",1365120000,56,394,4.213333333333333

5551835,5,B00B1LM730,"Great filmmaking SHOULDN'T take a back seat when making films that empower girls and women, but all to often that's what happens, particularly, when done by toy lines. The only other thing from a toy line I've bothered reviewing is ""My Little Pony; Friendship is Magic"" because it made it on to A Mighty Girl an archive of Feminist media, along with these, and MLP no longer deserves to be on there, because the Villains NEVER get punished for being evil, unlike the Villains in these films. The Villains help kids learn about abuse, war, geed, and death. ""My Little Pony; Friendship is Magic"" did episodes on serious subjects in Season Five, and botched it. Protecting yourself from evil people is NOT a skill girls are taught. What I love most about these movies is that they show girls the HOPE their empowerment can inspire in those around them.

These films look like the people making them actually cared. The colors are not too bright, not too dull. The sets and costumes are GORGUS. They look like they were filmed by a HD camera. The fact that these were based off of a toy line is UNBELIEVABLE! The ""Transformers"" movies are empowering to boys, but have the reputation of being very repetitive, and overall very bad. Proving that empowerment of either gender SHOULDN'T be the only goal of a film. Art and ""Girl Power"" can, and should, always go together.",1492560000,,1364,4.683333333333334
5551836,5,B00B1LM730,"This is a great deal on four excellent American Girl films. My children (daughter, age 7, son, age 9) both enjoyed them. The films are well-made and deliver good messages about being strong, smart, and standing up for what you believe in. Even my husband and I enjoyed the movies, as they feature good storylines and talented actors. Plus, buying this disc is a lot cheaper than renting or buying them digitally.",1492128000,,412,4.736111111111111

5551839,5,B00B1LM730,"I have played the Christmas (Samantha) film the day before Christmas break at school.  It touches upon important aspects of history: immigrants, class distinctions, inventions, women's emancipation, etc. while telling an entertaining story.  There is NOTHING to cringe about either in the script.",1490486400,4,296,5.8604651162790695

We would have liked a single disc with all 4 movies since these stay in the car and would only have taken one slot in the case.

These movies have a wonderful message! People these movies have nothing to do with the clueless messages that Barbie movies have. They are all about love, family, respect, courage, etc. Great movies! Would buy them again. Our daughter loves them! Today, it's the 26th, and she already watched them all. They are educational! They talked about war, Great Depression, and rights such as kids not working in factories and women right to vote... I would recommend you to sit with your child to watch these movies because although the content is presented in a way that a lil girl can understand, they might have some questions. I promise you would enjoy them as well!",1482710400,4,803,4.826086956521739

I have enjoyed then just as much as my American girl:o)  They all have wonderful learning opportunities in them. And are sprinkled with star studded cast and wonderful new comers.

So far I've watched the Kit and Samantha movies; both are very good. There are quite a few recognizable actors in them.

She was so touched by the story about the poor factory children that she gave me her outgrown clothes and a fifteen dollar donation (out of her earned money she saves for ""Shopkin"" toys) to give to my church's Children's Ministry!!! She wanted to give ALL her money! Her three year old sister and their mother and I also loved the movie. We did not see the other movies yet but I am sure they are great!!!

5551920,5,B00B1LM730,"My daughter loves the American Girl movies.  So much so, in fact, that she wore out the Kit dvd.  When I came onto Amazon to buy a replacement disc, I saw this one: FOUR American Girl movies in one.  And it was running at a cheaper price than just buying the Kit movie!  Of course, I bought this dvd, so that now my daughter can watch 4 of the historical girls' movies, instead of just one.

This dvd has the movies for: Kit, Samantha, Molly, and Felicity.  You might recognize the actress for Felicity: she's played by Shailene Woodley, who is Tris in the Divergent series movies (the last of which, Allegiant, was just released).  All of the American Girl movies are well done: period costumes, plot lines that are particular to the time period, and they are totally CLEAN.  No worries about whether these movies are suitable for young audiences.  They DO NOT have any objectionable language or sex scenes.  Each one also teaches a moral message about friendship.

If you have American Girl fans in the house and they have the dolls and/or have read the books, they will LOVE these movies.",1458950400,7,1091,4.572164948453608

I have very low tolerance to shabby story lines like many of the Barbie and other kid movies out today.  These movies deal with serious subject matter and conflicts and at the same time deal with them in a very wholesome way. They were enjoyed by the whole family.  Our whole family likes the show Little House for the same reasons.,1458691200,,443,4.653846153846154

She also likes American Girl movies so I wrapped it up for her and ordered another copy for us but then a dear friend had to leave 2 of her kiddos at home for a week with family while she traveled with her husband and middle son to have surgery. A few of us pitched in to pamper the family. I volunteered to get movies and treats for a movie night in. Their daughter is also a huge fan of this series so I packed it into there gift. Both mother raved about the movies and how much their kids enjoyed them. So now I am getting ready to order it for a THIRD time.

They all have an inspirational story line as well as ""some"" historical facts. My only dislike would be that all the DVDs are stacked one on top of the other versus each having their on spot within the case. This is minor but can be annoying when the one I am looking for is on the bottom and I have to remove them all to get to the one.

So lately there been no more barbies,doll babies, or"" pretend"". She's trading it in for fashion, nail painting and selfies :) Well she got some money for her birthday and I told her she could get something on Amazon . I was so shocked and pleasantly surprised when she picked this DVD.

It's four of the American girl movies on DVD. It all comes in one case but on four separate discs. They are all rated G and all of them are generally cute, well acted little movies. The length of the movies range from 80 minutes to 100 minutes. I was also surprised to see some  A list actors and actresses in the different movies. A few of those stars include Marcia Gay Harden,Mia Farrow,Joan Cusack,Chris O'Donnell,and Julie Ormand among others. I love, that while the  movies are entertaining, there is also a definite lesson in each movie. They take place in different time periods so my daughter was learning about the Great depression  and WW2 while enjoying a good movie. All in all, just really nice movies that are great for the whole family. The DVD set is extremely reasonably priced and while there is basically no extras on the DVDs,  you don't need or expect them.
Really glad we purchased this set. :)",1441238400,,1363,4.502024291497976

5552054,5,B00B1LM730,"We purchased this set for our American Girl fan for Christmas and it is a wonderful value.  There are four movies included, all based on historical doll characters.  This set includes the movies for Kit Kittredge (set during the Great Depression), Samantha (turn of the century orphan being raised by her grandma), Molly McIntyre (set during WW2), and Felicity (set just before/at the beginning of the Revolutionary War).

Our AG fan is on the younger side so she didn't really understand much about the wars or Great Depression but still enjoyed the movies.  I would recommend these movies for ages 7-8 and up.  Still, they seem to be very historically accurate and make these time periods very relatable for young girls just learning about these times and events in history.  As parents, we enjoyed watching these too.  I am always pleasantly surprised by the caliber of actors and actresses in AG movies.  Shailene Woodley is Felicity and Abigail Breslin is Kit, both actresses who have gone on to much bigger things.

Overall, even if your child isn't quite old enough for these yet, the price is too good to let this set pass you by.  Definitely glad I snagged these while I could!",1422057600,,1186,4.798029556650246

5552079,5,B00B1LM730,"This is excellent value for money as you get four period American Girl films for a reasonable price. My nine-year-old daughter and I greatly enjoy the AG period movies (more so than the contemporary ones) and this was an excellent deal. It contains four films: Kit Kittredge, Samantha, Molly, and Felicity:

Felicity: This film is set in 1775 Colonial Williamsburg and features 10-year-old tomboyish Felicity (Shailene Woodley) whose mother wishes her to be a proper gentlewoman. Instead Felicity chafes against the strictures imposed upon females of that time and wishes instead to ride freely astride her horse and gets into further adventures by befriending and helping an abused horse belonging to a brute of a man, Jiggy Nye. Young viewers also learn about American history such as the conflict between the loyalists (to England) and the patriots who wish to be free of England's rule.

Samantha: This film focuses on Samantha Parkington (played by the talented Anna Sophia Robb who was also in Bridge to Terabithia, another family favorite) who is a rich orphan living with her grandmother, Grandmere (played by Mia Farrow) in a grand home near the Hudson River in New York. Samantha is a compassionate, intelligent, and pleasant young woman who upon meeting the OMally girls, immediately takes to them. The OMally girls, especially Nellie, becomes Samanthas close friend despite the difference in their social status. The OMallys are hired help who work on Samanthas grandmothers estate.
The story becomes more interesting after Samantha moves to the New York City to live with her beloved uncle and his new wife, Cornelia. Samantha discovers that Cornelia is kind and passionate about causes, especially the suffragette movement. Samantha also finds it difficult at first adjusting to life in a new city, a new home, and school but gradually blends in. When she receives news that Nellies father has died and the OMally girls have been sent to an orphanage in NYC, Samantha becomes actively involved in helping the girls, and in the process discovers that she too shares her aunts passion for causes.
My nine-year-old loved this story as did I. There are many themes in the film such as the emancipation of women, the fact that child labor was common back in the day, and how there was a stark difference between the way the rich and poor lived (although that is still very much present today). The poor working conditions in factories where children were employed was horrifying to my daughter and she was disturbed to learn that such things still occur today, especially in third world countries.
The Christmas part of the story is really just part of the overall story so if you are expecting a film dedicated solely to a Christmas theme, you will be disappointed. My daughter and I found this film to be well-scripted and well-acted and certainly found it engaging.

Molly: Molly McIntire is a young elementary school aged girl growing up in mid 1940s Jefferson, Illinois. Her idyllic life is disrupted when her doctor dad decides to enlist and help out with the war effort in Europe. It is left to Mollys mom (played by Molly Ringwald) to help keep the family afloat, working in a factory putting together fighter planes. Molly is at first very resentful of her dad going off to war and her mom getting a job, and her resentment grows even more when she comes home one day to find a British evacuee in her home. Expected to share her room with the evacuee, Emily, Molly feels her world is crumbling, but a series of events helps Molly see that in times of war, compromises need to be made, and compassion is all important.
I agree with some reviewers that the film does not do the books justice and this is perhaps one of the weaker AG films (my nine-year-old and I loved the Samantha and Kit Kittredge films). This is due to the many liberties taken with the storyline, a great departure from the books, and the fact that the main cast for the most part is not very well-cast. The actress playing Molly seems awkward and ill-suited to her role, and the other cast members are also rather stilted in their performances.
However, what made this a worthwhile watch was the attention to period details which makes this film another engaging movie in the AG franchise of films. It may not be their best effort, but the historical details and overall storyline does entertain and keep the viewers attention engaged. I hope AG will make more of such films that deal with Americas past.

Kit Kittredge: Kit Kittredge An American Girl, much to my surprise, proved to be a well-scripted and well-cast film, and both my daughter and I found the film an engaging watch.
Abigail Breslin (who is maturing into a wonderfully talented young actress) plays the lead role as Kit Kittredge, an aspiring ten-year-old newspaper reporter. She lives in Cincinnati, Ohio, and is vivacious and intelligent. Life is rather hard in the Kittredge household as the time frame is that of the Great Depression. Many families have fallen on hard times, and Kits dad has left the family to seek a living elsewhere, hoping to make enough to provide for his family. In the meantime, Kits mom (played by Julia Ormond) takes in boarding guests into her home including a magician (played by Stanley Tucci). There are also a couple of young hobos who make Kits acquaintance.
When a series of burglaries occur, suspicion falls on the hobos, including Kits friend, and it is up to Kit and some of her other friends to prove their friends innocence. The story is set at a quick pace but not at the expense of the storyline. The film is also satisfactorily rich in period details including clothing and mannerisms particular to that time frame. This is wholesome family entertainment and my daughter and I found ourselves entertained. It also proved to be an educational experience for my daughter as we were able to discuss the Great Depression and its impact on the United States. Highly recommended.",1419811200,,5973,4.841487279843444

5552130,5,B00B1LM730,"These four historical movies are far superior to the more recent American Girl films which are based on contemporary topics. Child actors Abigail Breslin, Shailene Woodley and AnnaSophia Robb went on to earn acclaim in big budget Hollywood productions but they are also quite good in these films which are well written, entertaining, and instructive.  They teach young girls quite a.bit about American history while engaging them in captivating stories.  WIsh I could say the same about the more recent American Girl releases:  Chrissa stands strong,  Saige paints  the sky, McKenna shoots for the stars, and most recently, Isabelle dances into the spotlight.  In my opinion, none of these compare to the Four films offered by Amazon for the low low,price of about $12.  (I have to add that I admired Sammi Hanratty's performance in Chrissa stands strong, which focused on school bullies, but the film was too depressing to be entertaining; the mean little twerps  who made Chrissa's life miserable don't even get punished in the end. ). I endorse the films in ""4 favorites"". Don't miss out on this outstanding bargain.

5552219,4,B00B1LM730,"This is a fantastic bargain, with three excellent movies of historical fiction. Production values are top notch, and there is a touching realism that the more depraved side of Hollywood typically misses by a wide margin. ""Felicity"" (American Revolution), ""Samantha"" (early 20th century), and ""Molly"" (World War II) are superb efforts, well worth seeing over and over again. On the other hand, ""Kit Kittredge"" (Great Depression) is a major disappointment in such rarefied company, being manipulative, predictable, and often overacted. But buy this inexpensive set and fall in love with the other three, which feature lead actresses Shailene Woodley, AnnaSophia Robb, and Maya Ritter, each of whom is simply brilliant in her own right. (To be fair, Abigail Breslin is marvelous as Kit, too, but the production around her is woefully mishandled.) Believe me, you cannot go wrong with this purchase.
