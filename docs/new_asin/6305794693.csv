When this movie was transfered  from widescreen format to box format, the original subtitles were slightly  cut off.  As a result, when the movie had to be dubbed in English, no one  knew what the heck they were supposed to be saying.  So, the actors who  over-dubbed it made it up as they went along.  This movie will have you  rolling on the floor with laughter with such lines as, ""Why you  shukin' an' jivin me?""  and ""My Wife Test Drove one of those  american cars...IT'S AIRBAG EXPLODED!  And that's why, Mr. Mitsubishi, I  want to kill you for your business...""
Anyways, it kicked a**!",940982400,2,705,4.492063492063492

7894595,1,6305794693,There are different versions of this movie. This dvd picture quality is a little better but has glitches where the screen is black for a few sec. Otherwise this version isn't as good. The dubbing is absolutely awful. Not the original crew. I'm watching the other version right now wishing I would have watched it first. This dvd version is painful to sit through. Footage has been cut out of this one. It seems to drag on and is over focused on buddha. Right now I'm watching the other version right after  from a shaolin multi pack. I think it's better. I don't recommend this version it's misrepresented.,1478217600,,606,4.611111111111111

7894597,3,6305794693,"Not to blame the movie but this was in very poor quality, my friend has paid a buck for some in better viewing condition. This movie had good fight scenes worthy of watching. The time it took to get to the actual challenge the story is based upon I flipped to some cartoons to kill the time. Feeling guilty about missing scenes while watching cartoons I scanned back and watched the skipped over scenes, I didn't miss anything.

The fight scenes make this movie worth it, fast forward through the rest.",1174435200,,502,4.516483516483516

It was just an o.k flick,,,many fight scenes and the choreography satisfactory.  If you love you old school kung fun,,,you're safe with his one!!",1151712000,,252,4.976190476190476
7894599,3,6305794693,"The editing was poor to say the least. The film just shut down and went black for a few moments while the sound kept going. However, I must say in only blacked out four-five times, and only once in an interesting point. The color went a little hazy at times but would quickly shift back to normal. Would I buy it again? Yeah. Good flick with cool Kung-Fu. Without the editing burps, I would have given in a four.",1018569600,,412,4.227848101265823
7894600,4,6305794693,"This movie is definitely a classic. The plot is sometimes confusing, but it is pretty simple in general. Ninjas are trying to take over a shaolin temple for its assets, and of course there are many battles. Then the Japanese royal monk, who is visiting the Chinese shaolin monastery, is murdered by the ninjas. The ninjas blame it the monks, and Japanese shaolin monks come to get revenge for the murder. My favorite part is the scene where the Japanese and Chinese monks are having a competition-- the fights are amazing, and fluid, and there are an assortment of weapons being used. In fact, all the fight scenes in this movie are good, they are fast, well filmed, and well choreographed. One character uses nunchaku, a weapon rarely seen in kung fu movies. Another character has amazing staff techniques, sometimes they are even comical. After all, shaolin is famous for its staff techniques.

 The abbot of the shaolin monastery (I don't know the actor's name) is excellent. He only has one or two fight scenes, but they are really good. He also accurately expresses the philosophy of shaolin and Buddhism, unlike in some movies where shaolin monks are portrayed as villains or thugs.

 I am a little stingy with stars, so if a movie were to get 5 stars from me it would have to be perfect in my eyes. I really like this movie a lot, but there are a few things I don't like that prevent it from getting 5 stars. One thing that bothers me about this movie is that the filming is sometimes bad, things are cut out of the shot. But in the fight scenes the filming is always good, none of the shots are so close up you can't tell what's happening. Also, some of the costumes are corny, but overall the costumes and settings are good, and are in the style of the Ming Dynasty which is when the story takes place. I would recommend this movie highly, it is one of my favorites. I have seen this movie so many times I could probably recite all the lines, but I never get tired of watching it.",1002758400,,1989,4.456043956043956
7894601,3,6305794693,"This is an old school Kung Fu Collecters but unfortunetly no effort has been put into making this old school flick look better. I have not seen Ground Zero Entertainment's version but AVOID! Lion Video's version it is so bad I only paid $7.99 for it and i still returned it because the screen would jump,picture brake up,bad Editing ,and it looked like it was copied from a copied VHS. The sound sucks,no widescreen, and only in English dubbed. I can make a better DVD without trying just give me the tools . I'd rather pay $20 for a good version than  Lion's version for FREE!  We didn't buy a DVD to watch VHS quallity movies, DVD distributers hear me out! Anyway enjoy Shaolin vs Ninja and try to focous on the Kung Fu so you can forget how bad the quality is.",988934400,6,763,4.328671328671328
7894602,5,6305794693,"For a movie with such a generic name, I didn't know quite what to expect.  I was surprised to find that the movie was everything I could have hoped  for in a movie called ""Shaolin vs. Ninja""  The movie is not just  some knock-off with passing references to Shaolin temple and ninja  warriors.  There are fights galore of shaolin masters amd students taking  on slews of ninjas.  The fighting is first rate, intense, and everything  you're looking for.  The video would have been better in its original  widescreen format, and the very ends of subtitles are conseqeuntly cut off.  The only distraction is the audacious, shameless dubbing with not the  usual voice talent we've come to expect in our classic movies.  The dubbing  was clearly done in the 90s, with the dubbers substituting improbable  names, such as Shaquille,Bob, Raymond, Sylvester, and Tommy boy, for the  actual character's Chinese names, which can be read in the subtitles.  The  dubbers also add many lines of improbable improvisation, such as references  to Beverly Hills, Las Vegas, and airbags.  Inexplicably, the Japanese boss  is voiced as a supremely cheesy 70s blaxpoitation pimp...really!...  Some  might find this comical, but it in essence made the dialogue spoof-like.  The actual subtitled dialogue is actually all serious and coherent. But  don't let the dubbing issue keep you from adding this video to your  collection.  Phase out the laffable dialogue, and follow the subtitles  instead and you are in for a real treat.  If you like first-rate Shaolin  figting and ninja culture, this video is a true winner.",966211200,8,1594,5.038610038610039
