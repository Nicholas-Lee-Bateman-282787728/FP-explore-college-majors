8695287,5,B00RFLT39G,"This Danish serial set in 1928 depicts Denmark's glorious times where such Beachside hotels were found all over the country along the western coast of Jutland and also along many fjords on the eastern side - and likewise in other part of the country.  It is much like the loved English pieces with the upstairs and downstairs lives in great homes or as such a Beachside hotel, where many guests are returning every summer. A converter is needed and can be bought on Amazon for about $60. There are 3 Seasons (2 dvd's in each) and I am told that there is a 4th coming. It shows a time where families took time out to just enjoy the nature and a simpler life. Sadly, when more people got cars, and the economy improved after the 2nd world war, people started driving south for warmer weather or flew to other destinations, resulting in that these hotels could no longer stay open. In our restless mode of living today, these hours of going back in time are golden.  Highly recommend them, great acting, superb costumes to the times, and plenty of comedy as well.
