However, the one annoying thing about DVD is that the screen often flashed a little whenever switching between takes or scenes. Not sure if other people had experience this problem with their DVD copy.",1335916800,,378,4.414285714285715
937557,4,6304707010,"When you think of great Chinese films, you think of director Zhang Yimou, actress Gong Li and actor Leslie Cheung.  Well Temptress Moon has two of the three, Gong and Cheung and fills in the third with Chen Kaige.  Chen is a the director of Farewell, My Concubine.  Like Zhang, Chen is a master of the visual sophistication.  His use of color is exceptional.

The Pang family runs the opium trade from their country estates.  The head of the clan has two children, the older son and the much younger daughter Riyu.  The older son is married.  She has a younger brother, Zhongliang, who she brings to live at the estate.  He is to study and prepare her husband's opium pipe.  But after a while, he gets tired of his second class citizenship and poisons the opium, leaving his brother in law a vegetable.

Zhongliang escapes to the city and becomes an escort who blackmails his liaisons.  When the head of the Pang family dies, Riyu is named as the new head with the help of a distant cousin, Wansu.  Upon hearing this, the head of the gang that Zhongliang works for decides that it is time to send him back to the Pangs.

Zhongliang returns and sets his sights on Riyu.  She responds to his advances but things takes an unexpected twist when he realizes that he cannot deceive her.  To further complicate things, a third suitor enters the mix.  Riyu was promised at birth to the eldest son of another clan but this was cancelled because of her opium use.  He is now grown up and has decided to make his own mind up.  Of the three he would be the most acceptable.

The film ends in Shakespearean tragedy.

This is a beautiful film with textured performances but the film belongs to Cheung. His role is the most complex.  Gong is also very good but this is not one of her best roles (look to The Story of Qui Ju and To Live to see what she is capable of.)

937558,3,6304707010,"I bought the DVD from Singapore videoshops and have grabbed a copy and watched....hee hee....The story is about old chinese period where it involved the loving between the opposite party and the not loving situation where the actress finally get poisoned by opium and the actor killed by bad company he joined in shanghai after he left the old family style and wnt all the way to shanghai to study. There are a few scenes which are filmed in dark situation that show that the actress have sex. It is done in a smart way to such an extent that film censoring department are not able to say that these are sexual scenes. Recommended to those whom are interested in this genre of DVD film/movie.

937559,5,6304707010,"Definitely worth pining for! I decided to purchase Temptress Moon after viewing the breathtaking, and devastating, Farewell My Concubine.  Both movies feature the amazing talents of Gong Li and Leslie Cheung. So total is their transformation between the two films, it's difficult to believe that these are the same actors. While Concubine served as a historical epic, Temptress Moon seemed more along the lines of Shakespearean tragedy. Like Kaige's previous work, the characters' frustrations signify larger themes: domestic turmoil; gender repression; family conflict; etc. Although these themes concern the private sphere of life and are not as overtly political as those addressed in Concubine, they are just as much about power, its abuse and the resulting disfigurement of the human spirit.

Temptress Moon is by no means a romance. The movie succeeds in being lyrical and melancholy - more engrossing than entertaining.  Despite the requisite tragic ending, I found the plot to be oddly satisfying! The waxing and waning fates of Zhongliang, Ruyi, and Duanwu intertwined to create a luminous study of the heart and its insatiable hunger.  Overall, Temptress Moon was a clear reflection of the obsessions that ruthlessly dictate interpersonal affairs.  Leslie Cheung, Gong Li and Kevin Lin give mesmerizing performances, while supporting portrayals like that of Caifei He as Zhongliang's sister and Yin Tse as Zhongliang's Boss are equally flawless. (Among the movie's many moral messages: ""Don't Do Drugs!"" :)",1138492800,4,1516,5.489270386266094
937560,3,6304707010,"This is a domestic drama of the 1920s when China was fought over by warlords and Shanghai was a city ruled by fat-cat Western and Japanese interests and Chinese criminals.  The chaos and split-personality of China at the time is captured by the film.

What you can say about this movie is that it was not directed by Zhang Yimou who did (if I'm not mistaken) Raise the Red Lantern and Ju Dou which were excellent movies. ""Temptress Moon"" is similar to Zhang's work. But Gong Li, the lead actress, is less sensual than usual, the story is convoluted and complicated, and the plot strains credibility.

The lead male character, Zhong, is a Chinese Tom Cruise. The women all love him, despite the fact that he's a louse. He suffers horribly because they suffer because of their love for him. Nobody suffers as much as Gong Li. The photography is gorgeous. The movie is worth seeing and is intriguing -- but it's not good enough to see several times to puzzle out what is going on.

937561,5,6304707010,"Without repeating other comments here, Kaige's Temptress Moon offers much more than merely a meditation. It serves as an allegory of society in flux. Early in the 20th century China was buffeted by economic and social forces that are represented well here. The street scenes of Shanghai where automobiles, streetcars, and rickshaws jostle can be seen as representing the strains of an emerging modernity on China, while the Pang family's wrenching over the loss of the family's head, followed by Ruyi's angst over her role and place in the family and society at large, represent the strains of change. The opium is real and allegorical, and Kaige's message regarding the supposed advantages of western influences is plain to anyone who wishes to see them. Finally, Temptress Moon clearly the equal to if not superior to Farewell My Concubine.",1119744000,6,842,5.108695652173913
937562,5,6304707010,"Chen Kaige creates another period masterpiece with TEMPTRESS MOON, the story of a wealthy family struggling to maintain their history on the outskirts of Shanghai.

Due to her brother's condition resulting from an addiction to opium (or so we're lead to believe), Ruyi (the ever glowing Gong Li) is granted leadership over the family fortune at a time when women were relegated to secondary roles.  However, Zhongliang -- a close relation now grown up and playing a con man to perfection in Shanghai -- returns home to bilk her out of the family fortune at the demand of his boss.  When Zhongliang discovers he has fallen in love with her, he chooses to alter her fate ... but his choice only secures his own fate in the eyes of the triad he serves.

MOON is wonderfully photographed, though this image transfer is a bit grainy at times.  It is a contemporary 'Romeo & Juliet,' with gangland influences and wonderful period photography.  The lovemaking -- while pushing the boundaries in a mainstream foreign release -- is relatively tame but beautiful captured with powerful emotion and vivid lighting.  At points, the film feels almost like a narrative valentine to the family and the viewer; but don't look for any happy ending here.

The ending poses a small handful of tight flashbacks that gives new meaning to some of the events depicted in the film, defining more greatly the motivations of the main characters, once again demonstrating how meaningful small decisions are in the pursuit of daily life and how tragic their consequences may inevitably be in the day, months, and years ahead.

While it arguably may be a bit hard to follow at times, TEMPTRESS MOON nonetheless delivers as a truly spectacular, moving experience that should not be missed.",1091404800,19,1759,4.895622895622895
937563,4,6304707010,"This 1996 Chinese film is set in the sophisticated Shanghai of 1920 as well as the surrounding area.  It is a fascinating drama including opium smoking, love, lust and revenge. There's a beautiful young woman, who has been raised to prepare opium for her father and brother.  As her brother is paralyzed, she inherits the family home but despite her wealth, she is unhappy.  A distant male cousin serves her and falls in love with her.  But she falls in love with her sister-in-law's younger brother who has fled the household years ago because of a shameful secret and now makes his living romancing and blackmailing wealthy women in Shanghai. The plot thickens.

Sound complicated?  Well, it is.  But that didn't stop me from watching the story unfold in spite of the farfetched plot.  The scenery was beautiful.  The acting was excellent.  And the location was exotic. And so I relaxed and just enjoyed the film.  Recommended.",1083888000,2,929,4.853503184713376
937564,5,6304707010,"Gorgeous, decadent, sensual, at times psychologically incoherent, Kaige Chen's ""Temptress Moon"" is nothing if not always fascinating to watch because at the very center of this film, at it's core, is a story about family, desire and the things we do to each other in the name of love.
Set mostly in Shanghai in the 1920's when China was opening up to the world outside of it's borders, it is reminiscent of Bertolucci's ""The Last Emperor,"" in it's surface beauty and rich, idle, beautiful characters: Zhonglaing (Leslie Cheung), a gigolo and his cousin Ruyi (the incandescent Gong-Li) a recent heiress. Chen is a director who is more interested in showing than telling and his images are so dynamic and surprising that they smack you in the gut.
""Temptress Moon"" is a film of uncommon grace and beauty, more of a tone poem than a symphony perhaps but always deserving of your time and attention.",1074556800,20,895,4.818181818181818
937602,5,6304707010,"I think this film is in some ways an improvement over Chen Kaiges breakthrough film Farewell my Concubine. In the earlier film Kaige waters down a very good story with too many references to history. In Temptress Moon Kaige remains focused on his characters and keeps the tone of the film an intimate one. In fact the film rarely leaves the intimate corridors of the Pang family estate. It is within those mossy walls that Kaige tells this tale of three childhood cousins/friends/lovers whose intimate bonds to each other become poisoned by their changing roles within the family structure. History does play a part in this film but it is interwoven only very subtly. The family estate is isolated from the big cities but the corruption finds its way into the estate. In fact Chen Kaiges suggests by the nature and course of this story that corruption is built into the very nature of the old ways as well as the new. And this, in the end, becomes the theme of the picture. But this theme is so quietly fleshed out with such nice performances that by pictures end you find yourself amazed at what Chen Kaige has conveyed with his very intimate story. This is a much better crafted piece of filmmaking than Farewell My Concubine or the later Emperor & The Assassin.",1034985600,3,1264,4.647321428571429

937604,5,6304707010,"Temptress moon takes us to the pre 2nd world war China where emperor still ruled and powerful families lived in big lands with many servants and  employees. Story starts with a young member of the family who flees from  home after her sister and her husbands lustful and opium based life that  suffocates him. He poisons his sisters husband and flees to Shanghai. He  becomes a gigolo who ambushes married rich ladies and blackmails them for a  Chinese mafioso. Years later he returns home in order to seduce the young  master of the house who was also a childhood friend a sister to him. The  lead acting is provided by Gong Li and Leslie Cheung ,meeting one more time  after the ""farewell my concubine"" and executed brilliantly.  Scenes are well shot and especially nite time shots of the films opening  scenes as well as street shots and hotel ballroom shots of Shanghai is  impressive. Gong Li and her faultless innocence and Cheung's troubled  sophistication and regret draws the main lines of the story and it journeys  throughout the film, leaving us in curiousity of ""what will happen in  the next scene ?"" The real surprise of the film is the unexpected  ending that really adds to the overall success of the film. An alternative  story of love and hate which will get your emotions going.",967593600,17,1298,4.702222222222222
937605,5,6304707010,"I've seen most of Chen Kaige's films and this one is undoubtedly one of his best efforts.  Yes, there was plenty of luxuriant cinematography to  complement the decadent sensuality of the story line.  And yes the central  theme of the story - the tragedy brought on by one man's inability to love,  his indulgence in hate and jealousy - is a well-beaten horse.  But Chen was  so successful in creating richly-detailed, fully 3-dimensional characters  that the viewer quickly became interested in their fate and the watched in  fascination as the tangled web unfolds.
I did not find the pace of the  film too slow and mind you, I thought Mission Impossible 2 was too slow.  But I don't expect a 3 figure body count from a Chen Kaige film.  Nor did I  find the plot of the film especially complex, as long as you are not  distracted by the multitude of secondary characters and focus on the main  ones.  Ultimately, this is a story about boy (who happens to be a mobster)  meets girl (who is supposed to be the victim), boy falls for girl, boy is  scared of love, boy loses girl, boy becomes jealous and tragedy ensues.
Despite the undercurrent of tragedy always present, the film does not  lack for hilarious moments.  Leslie Cheung is dashing as the gigolo-bandit  who struts about sprouting pick-up lines such as ""Miss, where is the  family library?""  Gong Li gave her usual solid performance as the  woman discovering her sensuality and is always pleasant to look at, though  I have doubts about her range.
A great film.  But you have to be in the  right mood for it.",967420800,4,1568,4.586956521739131
937606,2,6304707010,"The 5th Generation of Chinese Film Makers have given us some of the best foreign cinema in recent years.  Chen Kaige has given us two of those in ""Farewell My Concubine"" and ""The Emperor and the  Assassin.""
However, I must admit to being slightly disappointed in  Temptress Moon.  The film looks good.  Gong-li always looks good.  And the  film does a good job showing the corruption in government and lifestyle  that was the Nationalist Period.  According to the film, The China of  Chiang Kai-shek and the decadence of the period was not good for the people  of China.
Unfortunately, the film is ultimately too slow.  The film lacks  those unforgettable moments of the many 5th Generations films.
Yes, the  film is a good period peace.  Yes, the film shows the horrors of Opium.  But ultimately, the film is just too much on the slow side.",961977600,6,841,4.696551724137931
937607,4,6304707010,"This film has a slow start, but it sets the stage for the later development of the central characters. Gong Li and Leslie Cheung, two extraordinary actors, are incredibly beautiful to look at, and the  chemistry between them is palpable. The relationships in this movie are so  complicated...there are multiple triangles...that one viewing is simply not  enough to do it justice. This one has to be seen a second time, and it will  be well worth it.",961632000,5,449,4.792207792207792
937608,5,6304707010,"It makes you think. Each of the three characters is human, fallable and understandable. X-liong, for his mistake made as a child, that he still suffers for in guilt and fear, Ruyi, for her humanity, and her curiousity  and her easily made mistakes and misunderstandings, and Dwan-Hu maybe the  strongest of the characters, suffers in silence and is driven by his pure  selfless love of Ruyi, which is shown at the end of the movie, which I  thought ended well, and in a sick way, justly.

937609,3,6304707010,"""Temptress Moon"" is like the erant traveler one meets on a long train journey. During the first few minutes of conversation you are fascinated by this person and eager to learn more of the journey ahead. But  gradually, you realize that something does not quite fit. As attractive or  atriculate as the traveler maybe, you can sense a gnawing quality of  shiftlessness and aimlessness. This person doesn't really know where he or  she is going. It seems that during the conversation, the traveler has come  to depend on you to validate the unmapped future. And when you part you  feel deflated by the enormous promise that was never realized. So it was  with ""Temptress Moon"".
""Temptress Moon"" has a lot of  beautiful touches but essentially lacks a story. So much of this movie  should have worked and just didn't. The premise of the young man, Zhong  Liang escaping from his incestuous sister only to become a gigalo in  Shanghai was fascinating. Unfortunately the story lost steam when Zhong  Liang returned home to seduce his childhood acquaintance played by a  mature, robust Gong Li. Somehow it doesn't add up when the thirty something  year old Gong Li is referred to as ""Gu Niang"" (young girl). The  innocence and naivite she displays when she is being seduced by Zhong Liang  is not believable. From the start she seems like a woman on the make, as  though she never stopped playing the wiley prostitute in ""Farwell My  Concubine"". Similarly, the various layers of deception and sexual  confusion in the film just lead nowhere.
As much as I love Chen Kaige's  work, not to mention the amazing cast in ""Temptress Moon"", I  parted from the film with enormous dissapointment.",946425600,6,1681,4.828070175438596

7878954,5,6304707010,"Temptress Moon is a lush and gorgeous film with a plot of Shakespeare-ian complexity, not unlike many Chinese film dramas. The setting is Shanghai during the Nationalist Period, a romanticized era of decadence and western influences, and involves a series of interwoven, albeit convoluted games of love, sex, and manipulation coupled with the grim realities of the opium trade and its widespread abuse.

At its heart, however, it is a reflection on relationships and how the emotional reverberations can linger deep in the heart long after the superficial reparations have occurred.  It speaks to the folly of passion and the duality in each of us; wrestling with love yet beheld to responsibility, leaving little but a hardened heart in the wake. Such subject matter is addictive to me, and this movie, as all truly memorable ones do, dares us to look in the mirror it brazenly holds in front of us, like so many of the moments when the actors look directly into the camera, glaring back in defiance to our feigned  innocence.

This is not a movie to watch casually and may indeed, as many have mentioned, require additional viewings to follow the plot. It rewards your patience with an evocative and melancholy hangover, two qualities I enjoy in a movie.  For Chinese cinema fans, there are a number of great Chinese actors, particularly Leslie Cheung, Gong Li, and He Saifei, and the director is Chen Kaige in his follow-up to the highly respected Farewell My Concubine.
