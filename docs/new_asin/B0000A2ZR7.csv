1901311,5,B0000A2ZR7,"I loved this DVD, every single minute of it. Barbara Benagh's instraction is detailed so that you know exactly what you are supposed to be doing, how you should breathe, and what muscles you must concentrate on or move. Jason Gordon, the demonstrator, does the exercises beautifully with perfect form and evident focus. I have tried other power yoga DVDs and hurt my back because I was not performing the exercises correctly and the flow of the poses were too fast for me. I love this dvd  because it is relatively slow (but NOT boring!!) so there is time to go into every pose consciously and really feel the muscles and joints open up while I breathe. The many different routines I can choose from is another definite bonus. I love this DVD!",1090540800,20,743,4.586466165413534
1901312,3,B0000A2ZR7,"I bought this dvd based on recommendations, I wasn't too enthusiastic after I tried it twice , I knew to expect a slower pace than other power yoga routines but boy that was SLOW!!! too slow for me and thats why it was boring, but this is definetly good for beginners ,although it features all levels,  the explanations are thorough and the instructor has a very calming voice and that was nice. This dvd features a lot of workouts but don't be fooled by the big variety, althogh nice, there all edited cuts of the same longer workout. The advanced level workouts were challenging because the poses are held forever! and thats why even in the  2 hours routine there's no big variety of poses. But whatever works for you!  I liked ""Power Yoga For Happiness"" with eoin Finn better!",1076889600,17,779,4.55
1901313,4,B0000A2ZR7,"This dvd is really what the title says.  I have never really practiced yoga.  I've picked up a class here or there, never serious.  Never before have I been truely relaxed and invigorated by yoga like I am now!  Amazing.  If you're looking for something you'll stick with, this one is a good bet.  I'm addicted to the bedtime routine and I've only had it a little over a week!  I have really bad lower back problems and this is helping me tons with that too...I mean tons!  It's a great stress reliever and I would highly recommend this to anyone!  Get this dvd!  (The only reason there are 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the guy demonstrating...he's so boney that I can see his *entire* sternum.  That's just gross to look at.)  :)",1074643200,12,736,4.330882352941177
1901314,5,B0000A2ZR7,"I've been wanting to try yoga for a long time, and decided to finally give it a try with this DVD based on a friend's reccomendation.  As a working mother of 2 young ones, I barely have time to eat, let alone work out on a regular basis.  But that's what makes this DVD so great - you don't need to set aside an hour to work out.  Each day, you can choose from the many routines offered and pick one that fits your time restraints and particular physical needs.  And the slow method  the instructor teaches has gently eased me into the world of yoga in a non threatening way.  Although I am still enjoying the exercises for beginners, I can't wait to tackle the intermediate and - eventually - challenging workouts this DVD offers!",1064188800,16,731,4.338235294117647

Barbara has a very soothing voice and explains the positions and flows very clearly, so you don't need to be popping your head up every minute to see what the model is doing.  I can do a 20-minute relaxation session or a full 100-minute session that covers everything, and anything in between.  Perfect for any level of yoga practice.",1458259200,,485,4.682352941176471

1901348,2,B0000A2ZR7,I bought this video because it had some length to it with several routines. It's not worth it. The longer routines are the same as the shorter ones only with more moves.

I've been told that these are made to order from a master, and that when producing mine, the maker hit the wrong selection. (I bought it new.)  There's way too much awesome yoga on it for a cd, so my copy takes ages to load, cuts out, locks up, and other frustrations. I've ordered another copy; that's how good the workouts are.

Multiple short selections and long practices are available.  The instructions are sufficient and encouraging.  I strongly recommend this for those looking for their next yoga dvd.",1437523200,2,357,5.418181818181818
1901358,5,B0000A2ZR7,"This is a really well conceived, thoughtfully produced yoga DVD.  Nothing flashy, just a lot of good yoga.  And when I say a lot, I mean a lot.  There are three levels of practice on this DVD, and a huge variety of practices for each level (different lengths, some more relaxing, some more challenging).  This is the kind of DVD that you can continue to grow and practice with for a very long time.
And as a yoga teacher, I really appreciate Barbara Benagh's focus on form, alignment and breath.  There is a lovely flow in her sequencing here.  My only slightly negative comment here is that I do question the use of the term Power Yoga in the DVD title.  Most power yoga practices move much faster, and if someone was looking for a video more in line with a more typical power vinyasa style, they might be disappointed in the pace.  That said, I find these practices to be a much better pace than a typical power vinyasa, where you are able to spend enough time in each asana to spend some time focusing on alignment before you move along to the next pose.  I was not familiar with Barbara Benagh prior to buying this DVD, but I now count myself a fan.  Really lovely DVD and an amazing amount of yoga for the price.",1430524800,21,1217,4.3215859030837

If I am short of time, I can do a quick yoga routine OR if I have plenty of time I can take on the longer routine.  My only complaint is that the beginner workouts are TOO beginner, I really did not feel like they were challenging enough.  I guess that is the point though....they are BEGINNER routines.",1409875200,5,451,4.333333333333333

I love the fact that I can choose the intensity, length and type of workout.  At first, I was slightly 'put off' by the slower pace.  These are not fast, flow sequences. BUT, when I finally began to trust the sequences and really concentrate on my form and breathing, I found it to be a much more challenging practice. You WILL be challenged.

Our society is often too focused on speed, and therefore miss the bigger picture.  This DVD has taken me to a new level with my yoga practice. I highly recommend it.",1373241600,,618,4.301724137931035

Many options for different routines. Just a couple of slight issues with the content. I was a total noob before I started, but I am pretty sure that anyone who needs a chair for sun salutations is not going to be ready for crane pose 20 minutes later.

I would have preferred a woman perhaps or he could have worn pants or something. That being said I am new to yoga and found the routines easy to follow. Sometimes I do the 20 min if I am short on time.  My normal routine is 1.5 hours a day broken up around my schedule. My 7 & 13 year old daughters also enjoy doing this with me. If your looking to lose weight this is not for you. If you are a beginner I would advise a warm shower to relax your muscles beforehand. You won't feel as much stress on your hamstrings and will probably be able to do an entire 40min vs a 20 min set.,1367193600,3,679,3.8156028368794326

1901394,3,B0000A2ZR7,"It's going to take me a while to work through this entire DVD, not just because of the length but also the increasing intensity of the sequences. Basically, there are three levels (beginner, intermediate, challenging) with a variety of practices under each level. For instance, energize...there is a beginner, intermediate and challenging. Not only do they vary in intensity but also in length, each practice getting longer as you progress to the next level.
This would be better if it would allow me to create my own sequences from the variety that they piecemeal together rather than only do the preselected workouts they have created. This is my only complaint because sometimes I would like to do the more vigorous vinyasas but don't have the 60-120 minutes to do the preset practice that these sequences are built into.",1359158400,3,824,4.978260869565218

Because the video has a beginners, intermediate and challenging mode, it was easy to jump right in.  This yoga is challenging but rewarding. It will take me some time to master these new positions but I don't mind that, as the stretches performed in the video are much deeper than I have done previously.  The segments build upon each other making it easy to advance as you learn. All in all, this is a great video for beginning, yoga practitioners looking to elevate their practice.

1901404,4,B0000A2ZR7,"I take a yoga class once a week, so don't consider myself the greenest beginner, but this DVD made me feel otherwise. In the beginner's section, they have side plank on extended arm for a long time, and CRANE! That's right, no feet on the ground, balancing on hands-only, as a beginner. I think not. On the plus side, the instruction for properly executing each pose feels explicit. As always, it's challenging getting into the pose just right, which is why it's called a yoga practice.

While it looked very promising with an accessible menu and many programs like my favorite entry level dvd by JJ Gormley, I quickly realized how repetitive and boring this dvd really is.  I bought this because I was ready to move to more challenging exercises.  There seems to be a concentration on the same movements and poses and they drraaaagggg ever so slowly through each and every program.  This dvd would best be suited for entry level newbies to yoga.

However, considering other yoga instructional videos (which include a few from Giam) this one is definitely not my favorite. There are many choices in workouts, which I commend them for, but the environment is sterile (like hospital yoga) and the music is a little aggravating. The video does not have flow between segments. Overall, a bit boring, sterile environment and choppy delivery. I guess my favorite part is savasana, but, of course, that is always the best part.",1290988800,7,534,5.149425287356322
1901420,5,B0000A2ZR7,"I am a yoga instructor with an intermediate to advanced asana practice with a beginners mind.  I found this DVD to be extremely powerful and will help me refine my asana practice.  I teach mostly vinyasa style yoga classes that tend to move one breath / one movement with longer holds and pauses interspersed throughout the practice.  This DVD helps the student learn to flow with control and precision in the form of the asana.  Many of the poses are held longer than many typically ""power yoga"" practitioners may be used to and the flowing portions move slowly which helps encourage a controlled ujjayii breath.  I found myself able to move much deeper into poses that I practice daily with more attention to my alignment.  The verbal instruction provided very helpful words and imagery which I plan to build in to the classes that I teach.

There is an interview (12 or 14 minutes) with the creator of the DVD in which she talks about ""Power Yoga"", what it means to her and that she understands many yogi's may have a different view and get frustration with the pace of the DVD.  Even if you are used to moving fast all the time I encourage you to practice with this DVD and slow down.  Learning how to slow down is something that many of us can benefit from in our fast paced lives.  Just because something moves slow, does not make it easy.  In fact, I felt that I had engaged and strengthened my muscles very much.

There is an option on the DVD to view more information about the practices where they break down in greater detail what you can expect from each of the practices on the DVD.  This was helpful if you do not have time to do the full practice as most of us do not.  If I had to guess, I would estimate that I own close to 50 yoga DVDs.  This is one that I treasure very much.  While there are days that I am seeking more movement, there are just as many days that I need some stillness in my practice.  Be open to trying something outside your normal daily patterns and habits.",1287100800,10,1996,4.351351351351352
1901421,3,B0000A2ZR7,"With a name like power yoga I expected this video to be an actual work-out video. It claims to have routines ranging in time from 20 minutes to two hours, and technically they are not lying. However, what it doesn't tell you is that the shorter routines are not work-outs- they are lying on the floor breathing. I haven't gone through every routine yet, but anything short seems to be a waste of time if you are looking to burn calories. Rather then call these routines work-outs I would have described this video as a well-rounded snap-shot of what yoga can offer. It is divided into three sections, beginner, intermediate and challenging- each section contains versions of the same routines (which I think should be better described). The routines toward the top of the list of each section involve lying on the floor breathing and stretching. The routines at the end of the list burn some serious calories.

Over all I am  happy with this video- after all I didn't return it. However, I like the idea of having some shorter (and presumably intense) workout routines for days I don't have 50+ minutes for the ""strength and balance"" or ""complete workout"" routines and while Power Yoga promised that it did not deliver. When I bought this video I also purchaced ""yoga for beginners"" and ""yoga for relaxation"" by the same manufacturer, and if I had known this wasn't as focused as it claims I would not have done so.

1901427,5,B0000A2ZR7,"I really like this DVD because it gives you the option to select your level, and choose from routines designed for that level. This is really great because it challenges you, but only as far as you should really be able to go for your level. I have only done the intermediate level routines so far, but I like not having three different people doing three different things in order to achieve demonstration of three different levels. This is just one person, one instructor, doing one level of yoga - YOUR level. It's great!

The routines are broken up into different types and parts of the body to work. It also lists the times for each routine which is great when you only have a limited amount of time to practice.

The instructor (voice over) is a woman with a bit of a strange accent (to my ears, at least), which took a little getting used to, but she is very good with giving the instruction for each routine. The practice is demonstrated by the man on the cover of the DVD, which is kind of nice too. ;-)

I'd recommend this DVD to anyone wanting a good, challenging yoga 'workout'/practice. Especially those who may currently be at a lower/beginner's level, and want to work up to an intermediate to advanced level of yoga. This DVD is really good for that because you can move into the more advanced levels once your current level of practice has gotten ""easy""/less challenging for you.

I know some people don't like the way the ""Yoga for Every Body"" DVDs are broken into segments and don't always ""flow"" that well, but I haven't noticed that as a problem with this particular DVD. So, no worries there. ;-)

Overall, it's a really great strengthening yoga practice for anyone at any level.",1266883200,8,1701,4.545751633986928

The woman's voice is wonderful, there is nothing cheesy or pretentious (for a change) there's audio flexibility.  There's a TWO HOUR workout which is awesome.

1. The practice is done in a studio with a really ugly green wall and carpet. Maybe that is not so important for some but it was visually distracting to me with its ugliness!

2. Although this video boasts on having 25 routines but in actuality most of them contain the same sequences in different order or in different combinations.

3. Beginner and Intermediate practices are way too easy even for beginner yoga practitioners. In my opinion, the advance practice is the only level remotely challenging.

4. The practice doesn't flow nicely as sequences are very much segmented.

Here is a slightly different approach where the flow is not as quick as a class, but is otherwise the same as classes I have taken, but still provides you with a workout to develop strength.

The routines are made of  flowing routines that give you time to get into position and really feel the stretch.  It is not too long, but slightly longer than classes I have taken and the slight extra time and focus has helped alot with some things I have not really been able to get the hang of before.",1236988800,7,733,4.27536231884058

I chose this one because the reviews said it was a slow work out.  I LOVE it!!  I was looking for a slow and relaxing workout to accompany my high speed life.  I spend my days chasing after 4 young kids.  I really was looking for something that would allow me to get into poses and then hold them.  I wanted to challange my patience, strenth, durability, and balance.  This video does all of that.  An added bonus is that I have noticed my thighs, waist and arms becoming noticably thinner.

My oldest daughter has started doing this video with me.  She enjoys getting the extra stretch in everyday too.

I think if you are looking for a SLOW relaxing, but still challenging workout this is a great video.  For those of you looking for a highly intense, ever changing pose, or fast moving workout this may not be the right fit.

I'm at a point where I need to be challenged with my  stretching/strength so when I found this dvd I was really excited.

But I have to say, I am disappointed. I will do the routines, but they don't flow from one segment into the next like a yoga routine would if you were doing it with an instructor (or like my favorite Giam dvd).  They are filmed in a boring room, and Jason the man showing us how to do the exercises, is very distracting.  I find Barbara's voice soothing, but they were very much a let-down after my previous dvd.

The model, Jason, has excellant form and the instructor, Barbara, is wonderful, her voice is soothing and the music is relaxing. Not the fanciest set, but it does not detract from the instruction.

1901449,5,B0000A2ZR7,"A few words about myself to make it easier for you to judge wether my opinion might be helpfull to you:
I'm a Power Yoga Instructor at a local Hotel Spa Fitness Club. I'm strongly into Yoga since about six years prefering Flow Routines challanging strength a lot but still contributing to all aspects of Yoga. I practice every day. Beeing german my english spelling is pretty bad, sorry for that!

About the DVD:

If you wan't to learn the correct allingnment of the Yoga Poses in a very detailed and professionel way, this DVD is for you. If you want to challange you're strength like hardly ever before, this is for you. And even if you're a complete Beginner you will find the proper modified workouts on the DVD.
I personally only use the challanging Level of the workouts (There is Beginner Level using props like a chair, and intermediate wich will be right for Beginners in good physical shape and there's the challanging programm). I personally skip the Beginning in the routines using straps and blanket. I guess it's ment to get your body and mind to the right point to start but in Power Yoga that is not neccesary and usually not done. The Sun Salutations give you all the warmth and stretching you need for any further Poses.
The Slow Flow Style of the DVD offers some great advantages:
First of all it allows you to be very very precise with the allignment of the Poses. With the Slow Flow and the instructors very detailed discription you really learn every aspect of the Pose. For Beginners to intermediate: Get this DVD to learn everything so you can use faster typical Power Yoga Flows and have proper allignment practicing.
The second Advantage is: In the challanging version it gets incredibly tough because you hold the Poses so long! You stay in low Plank for to coomplete slow breath, you stay in uward dog for even a lot longer... This is very hard to do and you need a lot of strength. There's nothing challanging your isometric Power like this workout.
I use the challanging Level ""Good Morning"" workout in the DVD often.
If you skip the intro it lasts hardly twenty Minutes. In this time you do only three Sunsalutations and a few forward bends more. That's it. Still it get's you cooking even more like some one hour Power Yoga routines! That's because you hold the Poses so long. Imagine: in 3 Sunsalutations there's 9 Times Plank, 9 times low Plank (holding the whole body two inches of the earth)and 9 times upward dog, now think you are holding all these Poses between 2 to 5 very slow breath. Now that's Power Yoga!
One other thing I discovered is that I feel even more totally refreshed and full of energie after doing this rather short routine than I do after some longer and faster routines. The Full workout in Challanging version is really very hard to do. You have to have a lot of strength and you need to be a long time Yoga Practicioner.
There is many different workouts in all three levels on the DVD though ranging from 25 to 90 Minutes. There is something for every day, something for every level.
I highly recommend this DVD. It is different but great. Even though I personally do the faster typical Vinyasa Flow Routines more often, and I myself teach a faster and dynamic style, I learned a lot form the programm and always enjoy doing it from time to time. See my listmania list on Power Yoga for all DVDs I recommend.
I hope this was helpfull to you!

1901451,4,B0000A2ZR7,"This is a valuable DVD, if not quite ""For Everybody"" in the same way that J.J. Gormley's DVD in this same series is.

The main strength of the program is the combined teacher voiceover of Benagh and the inspiring demonstration of Jason Gordon the student. Benagh is calm and does a great job of focusing your attention on core, not surface strength. I like it when she tells you to breathe into tight areas ""as if your lungs were there.""

I'm puzzled, though, that the skill level required from segment to segment varies so widely, at least within the Beginner workout (the only one I've done so far). If you do the full 90 minute workout, it starts off with very slow, eminently doable warmups, and then moves into a highly modified sun salute using a chair ""for those of you who find the other versions on this DVD too challenging."" You think, ""Great, piece of cake."" Be prepared, though---over the next hour or so you'll end up doing revolved triangle pose, side planks held FOREVER, a full cobra that pulls forward into upward dog (also held FOREVER), and even an advanced arm balance. (That part always makes me laugh---the ever-calm Benagh shows brief excitement, saying, ""You're in Bakasana!!"" I always answer, ""No, I'm not."") I do think it's odd that they give all this stuff to the same people that they thought might have trouble performing unmodified sun salutes. I've even toyed with the possibility that my DVD is defective, tracking to advanced sections where it isn't supposed to. If so, someone let me know!

At any rate, this DVD is nice and challenging and full of useful insight, though not really for rank beginners. I can't wait to find out what the Intermediate practice is like (some far-off day when my arms are stronger).",1143849600,16,1746,4.699346405228758

This is a DVD that you can grow with and learn a lot from. I bought a few power yoga DVD's all at once - and had I known how much this offered and how well it was put together I would have only bought this and Yoga Shakti with Shiva Rea. Moderately good was Power yoga with Rodney Yee and moderately moderate was power yoga with Bryan Kest (a bit fleshy and flashy for a yoga dvd). Poor was Ashtanga Yoga with Nicki Doane.

This DVD's instructor is precise and very engaging with many alternatives to fit anyones fitness level or flexibility.  Its a slower pace than advanced power yogi's may be in to, but the slow pace method is gaining popularity and this DVD is just on that curve.  Most of all its an incredible value with user friendly capabilities.",1107820800,11,616,4.572727272727272

In response to the reviewers who claim that it moves too slowly: Heat can be built up in the body through either a quick flow or through long-holding poses. It seems to be a question of personal taste which road you take, but both will get you there.

Barbara Benagh's voice is soothing and her instructions are complete. Some videos require you to constantly look at the screen to figure out what to do next or allow you to become complacent in the practice, in this workout she reminds you gently to keep the pose pure and not become sloppy.  The background music is perfect for a calming yogini experience. You will leave the routine refreshed and ready for life's next challenge.",1095120000,21,764,4.651851851851852
1901462,4,B0000A2ZR7,"I read a few reviews of this DVD concerning ashtanga teachers requesting their students to try this DVD as a change of pace to practicing the Primary and/or Intermediate Series of Ashtanga Yoga.  I can definitely understand why.  I tried a few of the work outs on the DVD.  The Sun Salutation, the Standing and Balance Series.  The  work has a similar intensity to Sun Salutation A & B and the Standing Postures.  The biggest difference is there are certain poses you feel as if you are doing forever.  For instance Chateranga (a.k.a ""Yogic Pushup"") is performed so many times and so slowly, a person can't help, but get stronger. This is a part that's kind of breezed through (at least I do) when doing the sun salutations when I warm up for the Primary Series.  This DVD forced me to pay attention to detailed aspects of the practice like this one.

Ashtangis will definitely recognize most of the poses performed on this DVD (e.g. hand to big toe, hand to foot, triangle, revolved triangle, side angle, revolved side angle, etc.)  There are a few poses that are performed a little differently.  For instance the standing hand to big toe pose is performed with the arm extended out instead of having the hand on the hip, the intense side stretch is performed with the hands on the floor instead of behind the back in prayer position.

The pace is indeed slow, but ujjayi (victorous) breath is maintained throughout.  I think this is the type of workout that will make a person who is used to practicing Ashtanga or any other type of fast flow yoga to slow down and focus on holding poses.  There are several levels of the workouts that a person can try (beginner, intermediate, challenge).  I tried the challenge and perhaps that is why some of the poses were held the way they were.  Despite the slow pace, I was certainly able to work up a sweat performing the workout.

I would suggest this DVD for anyone who wants to try flowing type yoga, or a person who is used to faster flowing styles to try and slow down a little.  My only problem with this DVD was there would be certain points where the dvd would just stop.  I'm guessing this is a technical problem, which probably doesn't have much to do with the content of the tape itself.  Otherwise, this was a good solid way to do an ashtanga-type workout, without as many of the really difficult poses included and at a much slower pace.",1092700800,33,2393,4.52093023255814
1901463,5,B0000A2ZR7,"this is not your ordinary power yoga dvd.

if you are looking for a big sweat, or an aerobic-style yoga workout, you will not find it here. if you are looking for ashtanga, you should learn from a trained teacher, but the david swenson or john scott dvds and books are the way to go to support your instruction. what you will find here (though, if you are like me, it might take some pouting to get there) is a deep and powerful conscious practice of yoga that can brign benefits both physically and psychically in ways that many other yoga workouts simply do not.

like other dvds in this series, there are a number of routines at beginning, intermediate and advanced levels. you can select practices for morning or evening or with themes such as invigorating, strengthening, balancing, quieting, or do the full workout. the routines are composed of different assortments of segments focusing on: breath awareness, deep tissue awareness, sun salutations, strength work, backbends, and forward bends. the routines range from 20 minutes to 2 hours. you could also jump within a routine if you prefer to do something other than what is set forth.

the instructor has a gentle and encouraging manner, though she sounds like she is reading from a script rather than describing the poses. still, she is pleasing and informative. a long-time student of hers demonstrates the poses with impressive grace, strength, and awareness.

my preferred yoga practice is ashtanga, and i enjoy balancing that with more gentle and pose-focused practices. i also have the yoga for every body dvd in this series, which i have been using more often because i enjoy its versatility. this dvd, however, has great depth and can seamlessly move you into both the physical and not so physical aspects of yoga. the beauty of it is that, if you are not attracted to the spiritual grounding of yoga, conscious practice with this dvd can still give you the benefits without all the talk that would likely turn you off. if you already have a spiritual practice, this will blend with it without conflict. i find that the principles i am learning from this instructor are infiltrating in my other yoga practices, to great benefit.

if you are not sure about this, try staying with it. i was skeptical with the slow pace at first, actually, even quite a bit annoyed. but it is worth letting yourself quiet into this enriching yoga practice.",1092700800,25,2405,4.799516908212561

Picture: This is a subtle complaint, but the picture here is very weird. it's almost like they didn't use a camera with full color capabilities; the images often look shiny and almost flat.

Content: This is YogaLite. Instead of teaching you real poses and then showing you how to modify the pose to make it more or less challenging like most good yoga instructors, this routine is entirely simplistic.

Also, there is way too much voice instruction - so much so that it causes the routines to go extremely slow.
