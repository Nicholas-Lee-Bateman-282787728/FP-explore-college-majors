1877959,3,B000093W4U,"""I'd always wanted to make an unsentimental film about the complexities of women's friendships,"" declares the director of ""Me Without You."" The film is however, very sentimental, and explores the love relationships of its two main characters. Sometimes they share the same love interest, at times involuntarily. Sometimes they hate each other over a lover. Sometimes they laugh, and sometimes they cry. The film is also quite simple and not complicated at all. That hurts it a little. We would have loved to go deeper into what makes up a woman/woman friendship; very special and very desirable on one hand, but very difficult and suffocating on the other. The director chooses to just treat the visible part of the subject matter, and does so successfully. The result - a film as charming as its two characters/interpreters. Michelle Williams especially, gives a very subtle and emotional performance, that her role in ""Dawson's Creek"" doesn't allow. A very ""cute"" film about love in general. For those who have a wonderfully suffocating best-friend, they will relate well to this piece. PhilEd. [...]",1028592000,3,1102,5.162011173184357
1877960,4,B000093W4U,"I found that this movie was very true to life. How many times do I remember wanting my best female friend to go away but stay beside me forever? That's the phenomenon about it. Sometimes, there seems to be a very strong, mysterious bond between women. It's like: no matter what happens, you can come back together and fix whatever went wrong. (This review has a couple of spoilers: don't read if you haven't seen the movie.)
That's how I felt watching this movie. It showed the years go by for Marina and Holly (they constantly referred to themselves as Harina) to show that they were ""one."" It started out when they were young girls and followed them through their 20's.
At the beginning, you see that Marina is the ""wild"" one and Holly is the more practical, ""good"" girl. Troubles start to happen when the girls reach their teenage years. All along, Holly has had a crush on Marina's brother Nat, and it seems that he feels the same way about her. (SPOILER) Unfortunately, Marina seems to do everything in her power to keep the two of them away from each other, including: ripping up a letter for Holly from her brother the day after Holly and Nat had sex.
Time goes on, and they move into their 20's. People start to realize that they are very connected to each other, but to some, it seems a bit unhealthy. (Another SPOILER) They both get involved with their tutor, played by Kyle Machlachlan, and when each one finds out about the other, it temporarily ruins their friendship. (This is why you should not let men come between two women! It never works!) Anyway...
Towards the end, we find that Marina needs Holly a lot more than Holly needs Marina. She tends to feel suffocated by Marina, who claims.. ""There is no me without you."" (Hopefully, I got the quote right.) It all feels very dramatic, beautiful, and horrible at the same time, because you feel for this girl that has no identity without her best friend.
I really enjoyed this movie and I thought that Michelle Williams's accent was great! It felt like she worked a LOT with the dialogue coach to get it just right. The chemistry worked for all of the characters. The only reason I gave it four stars and not five, was because I would have liked to see Holly come out and face Marina about her manipulative nature and about the fact that she was keeping her away from Nat for so long. Maybe that's not important to others, but if someone was lying to me and being so cunning, I would have a hard time staying such good friends. Also, I think that it ended too easily, like a neatly tied bow, although very sweet. It made me feel sentimental and miss my female friends terribly! You should see this movie if you are nostalgic like me!!",1028419200,2,2699,4.476673427991886

If you are a Brit. in your thirties then re-live an era with which you probably look back with some fondness.
If you are American then this is typical student Britian in the late seventies and eighties. The somewhat colourful language is not there to offend but to typify British youth culture of the day. It's a compelling view and I recomend it strongly.

1877993,5,B000093W4U,"A complex realistic, if we really talked about it, movie about friends, love and finding the truth of one's life and destiny. I loved it as it twisted and turned as friends both love and hate their lives and each other for being real. There were times one might raise an eyebrow and think ""what?"".life is sticky, confusing, frustrating for all  as they try and figure out an answer for their own feelings & actions that don't make sense, or follow a logical pattern. I enjoyed the acting that acknowledged that things aren't always pretty and perhaps the reality of that and allowing that and loving the imperfection that ""defines"" us and forgives us was really well done. The movie made me wonder, for the first time, why is it ok and encouraged  that we so easily leave friends behind to something new, but not a marriage when in many ways friends are closer to the truth of loving who you are than the life of coupledom... worth some exploration.  Michele Williams really knows how to touch the imperfections and make them her own in her very real acting abilities. I never saw Dawson's Creek but what she does here is just the beginning as we all know. It will be interesting to see what she can do in her next film as Janis Joplin. I was a little surprised when I heard that as I can't imagine anyone being able to do so the very misunderstood and  complex ""Pearl"". But I can see it now after seeing Michelle in this movie and Blue Valentine.  She is not afraid to pick the challenges, as we see here. Janis will be her ultimate because there are so many who know so much and identify so well with the woman who was dead before she was born.",1480723200,3,1646,4.383606557377049

1878017,4,B000093W4U,"Very entertaining and interesting story about 2 best friends with good performances by both main characters and the supporting cast. I liked watching the friendship develop as the girls grew up, staying close despite their very different home lives.  It was interesting to see the manipulation happening in the relationship between 2 lifelong best friends in spite of the fact that they cared very much about each other; the girl being manipulative as well as the one being manipulated. I have seen friendships like this in life, and the movie offered more insight into the relationship than just observing. I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone, so I'll just say that I liked the ending. I have seen too many movies lately that just seemed to stop, like getting to the end of a good book just to realize that the last chapter was missing. But not this movie, it had a satisfying ending but also left you excited about the possibilities the future held for the two friends.
I was not too impresssed with the cast's wardrobes though, they were like a cliche of the time period and did not fit the tone of the story.",1471478400,5,1119,4.623115577889447

Michelle Williams and Anna Friel are great as Holly and Marina two lifelong friends so close that since childhood they dub each other ""Harina"". As the years pass that friendship seems to be slowly deteriorating, whether it's their contrasting personalities, both girls unknowingly sharing a lover, as well as deceit and emotional manipulation on Marina's part in keeping Holly and her brother Nat apart despite the mutual attraction between them. When Holly realizes she has to cut Marina loose near the end, it felt true to life as I have been in the situation where you have to say goodbye to a once great friendship that has since turned toxic.

There is definately some drama between the two, each budding to break from their chains.
Good acting, decent story, a nice subplot love story going on.
My only issue was this movie lacked a great story, something with more punch (drama) to move it along faster. And possibly some stronger characters as well.

When the girls combine their names as children into ""Harina,"" instead of ""Hollina,"" it is obvious that the friendship is more about Marina than Holly-- for both of the girls. Marina needs Holly more than Holly needs Marina, although they love each other deeply. Marina sabotages Holly's hopes on more than one occasion, and attempts to be more and more like Holly as the two grow up together. Marina's most petulant and hurtful sabotage of Holly takes place in a fit of anger and jealousy after a night that was wonderful for Holly, but Marina's worst nightmares are realized. Although somewhat understandable, her action causes the audience to gasp, ""Oh, no!"" and resent what Marina has done to Holly in this moment. Marina holds onto this anger, and breaks Holly's heart many more times before Holly decides to break her ties to Marina.

 Every woman who has ever had a best friend or a frenemy will appreciate this movie. I've never seen the dark side of female friendships represented so well. Michelle Williams is Holly, ""the sweetest girl in all the world."" She is an intelligent, shy, overlooked beauty. Her best friend's brother (Oliver Milburn), is absolutely captivating and charming. If you don't fall in love with this movie, you'll fall in love with him. Anna Friel does a capital job as her manipulative best friend. The contrasts between their personalities and the events that unfold are both heartbreaking and heartwarming.
Also has a great soundtrack, and it is not your typical chick flick. Even my husband enjoyed it.",1138838400,4,898,4.756410256410256
1878102,4,B000093W4U,"Marina and Holly were best friends as children and vowed to always be together. But as they grow older, the nature of their relationship changes for the worse. Although Marina (Anna Friel) is an outgoing party girl, she seems unable to find an identity of her own and instead relies on the smarter and more introverted Holly (Michele Williams) to provide her with one. Holly is in love with Marina's brother Nat (Oliver Milburn), but Marina's jealousy has always come between them. Holly can hardly have a relationship with any man before Marina claims him for herself, leaving Holly heartbroken. After college, Holly pursues a writing career and Marina seems to make a career of forcing herself into Holly's relationships. For some reason, although she blames Marina for her misery, Holly allows Marina to turn her life upside down.

""Me Without You"" is an especially true-to-life character drama. Marina and Holly are both interesting people, and each is sympathetic in her own way. The film's characters, their actions, and their feelings are all believable. Anna Friel and Michele Williams are exceptionally effective in their roles. It turns out that Michele Williams, probably best known for her teen roles in ""Dick"" and in television's ""Dawson's Creek"", is a very fine actress. Kyle MacLachlan has a small role as Daniel, one of Holly's and Marina's love interests. A story about a childhood bond that gets out of hand and becomes a co-dependent relationship of disastrous proportions sounds like it might be either a colossal bore or a horror flick. ""Me Without You"" is neither. Sandra Goldbacher's adept direction moves the story along at a fair clip, and it is easy to share these characters' frustrations.",1127001600,4,1716,5.063604240282685
1878103,4,B000093W4U,"Friendship is an important thing in living and there are plenty of films that tell the stories of great friendships.  ""Me Without You"" would not be one of those films, because you repeatedly have to wonder when you are watching this 2001 film whether Holly (Michelle Williams) and Marina (Anna Friel) really like each other.  The two girls grew up living next door to each other in London in the early 1970s, and when they were young, dressing up and bouncing on their beds, they make a pact of eternal friendship.  It seems clear this is a mistake, because Holly is the smart one but follows the lead of the dominating Marina, but there is nothing the two can do about it because their lives are so completely intertwined that a trauma for one invariable involves the other as they grow up and move on into the 1980s.

""Me Without You"" is directed by Sandra Goldbacher from a script by Goldbacher and Laurence Coriat, and I wonder what personal demons they are exorcising here because the pain and regret rings so true.  I also find myself considering this film to be the anti-""Beaches.""  There you had two young girls who form a friendship because of a chance meeting and who keep in touch over the years, especially during the key moments in their life.  Her you have two young girls who form a friendship because they live next door and they have nobody else in their lives.  They live together as often as not and are in each other's lives almost constantly, so that every time they fall in love the other seems to be some sort of impediment to living happily ever after.  We jump from year to year, with attention paid to what Holly and Marina wear along with the music they listen to, and the question is whether the two will be able to survive their friendship.

You can pick your moment where this friendship clearly becomes dysfunctional and a bad thing rather than a good thing, but I think the die is cast when Holly finally sleeps with Marina's brother Nat (Oliver Miburn).  She has had a crush on him since the beginning, but Marina sees this as some sort of betrayal, and from then on Holly is the sympathetic figure in this story, although to some extent she wins that position by default.  The division between the two friends becomes starker when they both end up in the bed of Daniel (Kyle MacLachlan), an American lecturing at their college.  The both want to sleep with Daniel and he obliges them both, and then is thoroughly befuddled when it turns out the two young women are closer than the thought.  For Marina the relationship seems to be nothing more than another competition with Holly, while for Holly the truth takes away all of the joy of an important personal epiphany.

I was not sure why Michelle Williams was adopting a Brit accent to do this film, but she was the reason I checked out this film, not just because I saw a shot of the seaweed scene.  To date in terms of ""Dawson's Creek"" alumni, Williams might be the forgotten one because she does not get big films but she is putting together a solid resume with films like ""Prozac Nation"" and ""If These Walls Can Talk 2.""  The important thing here is that if Williams's name is enough to get people to see this movie with its almost brutally realistic depiction of friendship between two young women, then so much the better.  ""Me Without You"" is not an uplifting film, but given its honesty it certainly is a refreshing one.",1125532800,2,3412,4.520325203252033
1878104,5,B000093W4U,"I first caught this movie while flipping channels.  I was immediately drawn to the love/hate relationship between the two main characters.  The performances of Anna Freil and Michelle Williams (very under-rated actress.. she is always excellent) were real evoked memories of days gone by.  The love triangle (and I use that word liberally) was also one that well written.  On top of everything else, the movie soundtrack is filled with past gems that bring the story and timeline to life.  I highly recommend this movie for fans of the Bridget Jones movies.",1119830400,3,557,5.010869565217392

The situations and dialouge were commendable, but Michelle Williams made the material come alive. Her wistful, longing looks, together with her breathtaking beauty, make Holly (her character) sensual and accessible.

I am sure that women will relate better to this film than men. But, that said, some will find themselves within these scenes also.

Make the effort to see this movie, and enjoy it for what it is.",1096761600,3,537,4.955555555555556
1878106,4,B000093W4U,"Worth it to witness the hard, ugly truth of friends who love each other and will spoil everything for one another to prove it.  Also worth it for the well-crafted acting and very accessible script.  However, for me, this tale of friendship became the mere backdrop for a surprisingly romantic story of longing and disappointment.
Michelle Williams does a remarkably subtle job throughout (I didn't expect this performance from her), and she is able to convey her character's infatuation for Marina's older brother with a truth never seen in the lovesick characters of Dawson's Creek. But the true revelation here is Oliver Milburn, who adds layer after layer to the cool but kind Nat.  It is no wonder that Williams' Holly can't let go of her crush on this young man; in the skilled hands of Milburn, Nat becomes a ""real boy"" and is one of the most endearing ""objects of affection"" that I have seen in the movies in quite some time.
All performances are wonderful, with some small, very funny moments that can be easily missed if you aren't paying attention (I caught many on my second viewing).
Why not 5 stars?  Well, I must confess that the ending left me wanting more.  Also, don't expect extra's on this DVD.  Except for the typical scene selections, subtitles (which was actually helpful - there is a lot of whispering in this movie) and 3 previews, there is nothing really added to this DVD.",1087171200,12,1398,4.709016393442623
1878107,5,B000093W4U,"This excellent film follows two girls who have been friends from childhood. They've lived next door to each other and are in and out of each others' houses daily. Holly is a sky, bookish, Jewish girl whose mother `comforts' her by saying ""Some girls are pretty, and others are smart."" Thanks, Mom. Marina, OTOH, is a knockout, has glamorous but unstable and unreliable parents, and a brother whom Holly secretly lusts after. As they grow, their friendship remains the one constant in their world - but one does wonder that it takes so long for Holly to realize that Marina is just using her and being very mean about it in the process.
Without either knowing (but of course all is eventually revealed), they have an affair with the same college professor, but throughout, there's this underlying attraction of Holly to Marina's brother, Nat, even after he's married a French actress.
Great flick with a touching ending. Terrific acting by everyone.",1086480000,10,948,4.894409937888199
1878108,4,B000093W4U,"Going through the cable channels, I came across this movie and left it at that channel.  Anna Friel, last I saw her as the wife of Nick Leeson (portrayed by Ewan McGregor)in ""Rouge Trader"", plays the outrageous Holly.  American actress Michelle Williams is her bookish and shy best friend Marina.  The movie focuses on their friendship from when they are children to their teen years and as adults depicting their different personalities and the men that come and go into their lives.  One person that stands out is Holly's brother, Nat, who Marina has been in love with since she first saw him.  He is the center of Holly and Marina's friendship.  Holly would rather Marina not have anything to do with her brother.  She uses her brother to control her friend and Marina, at times, allows Holly to do that to her.  Their relationship takes a pivotal turn in Holly is engaged to be married and is expecting.
Friendships take time to build and can take a matter of seconds to be destroyed.  In this movie, Holly and Marina, two different individuals remain strong ties despite their ups and downs and backgrounds.  The music provided a good backdrop for the movie asn well as the clothing of the decade.
Their friendship had been through some odds and ends.  One should let the other go so that one could make her own decisions and see what is in store for her.  It could have made them or break them.",1086134400,2,1400,4.578313253012048

1878110,4,B000093W4U,"This small, understated film explores the agony and ecstasy of being a friend, tracking the relationship between two British girls, Marina (Anna Friel) and Holly (Michelle Williams of ""Dawson's Creek"" fame), as they find their way through the 70's and 80's.  It is an unflinching, non-moralizing account of two people who grow up and grow apart but who can't let each other go.
Early on, Holly's mother says, ""There are pretty people, and there are clever people,"" and it's clear that while Marina falls into the pretty category, Holly thinks the only thing she can be is clever.  Marina's glamourous, party girl behavior belies her deep insecurities and neediness, which also prompt her passive-aggressive behavior toward Holly, all attempts to maintain control of a friend who needs nothing more than to break away from her.  Holly also carries a torch for Marina's brother Nat (Oliver Milburn) who admits the feeling is mutual, but the timing is never right.  It's clear that while the girls were inseparable as children, as young adults, Holly develops a personality and individuality all her own while Marina can't separate her identity from her friend.
The film drags in sections and often beats you over the head with the points it attempts to make, but all in all it is an enjoyable little movie.  Williams handles the English accent remarkably well and shows that she is probably the most gifted of the actors to emerge from ""Dawson's Creek.""  Friel may get the fireworks, but as Holly, Williams ultimately gets the more interesting character.  It is also amusing to witness the changes in fashion and music as the characters go from 1973 to 2001.

While Michelle Williams' character struggled to find herself, and to become independant and happy, she continuously finds herself sabotaged and put-upon by Anna Friel's character. We all have friends like that - just keep taking and taking until there's nothing left anymore and you can't remember why you were friends in the first place.

Michelle Williams is adorable but obviously American.  She's no Renee Zellweger when it comes to ""becoming English"".  Anna Friel was remarkably good, but deserved a better character to show off her talents.
The story itself attempts to be a portrayal of competitive friendship, but looses focus in its forced absurdity.  The characters avoid communication in situations that could easily be resolved with a few honest minutes of conversation.  The verbal back-and-forth that *is* so horrifyingly portrayed in the movie are pointed at the most boring and painful-to-watch ""intellectual"" exchanges are no fun to be involved in and less fun to watch.
The ending is such a let down and far too predictable.  It's almost as if the director realized that he was kissing the hour-and-a-half running time he was anticipating and tacked a ""Oh, yeah, 7 years later they all lived... uh... ever after?"" on the end.
The DVD itself has nothing to speak of in the way of special features - just the typical scene selection, audio options, and trailers buttons.  *yawn*

Me Without You is a look at two young English women from the 1970's to 2001.  They're in constant competition although neither of them realizes it until the end.  Marina, the ""beautiful"" one, seems to have a hold on Holly, the ""smart"" one.  In the end, Marina is the friend who really doesn't have it all together.
GREAT soundtrack!  Fabulous English accent by Michelle Williams!  I found myself liking these characters from the very beginning of the movie and couldn't wait to see how it all ended.",1057622400,,879,4.477987421383648

1878128,4,B000093W4U,"Friendships can be odd. And I have never seen a more realistic friendship depicted on film than that of Marina and Holly in the engrossing and powerful ""Me Without You."" The film brilliantly reveals a less tidy, more insidious version of 'friends forever', one in which undying loyalty coexists with cruelty and subterfuge.
There's no question the friendship between affection-starved man-eater Marina (Anna Friel) and studious Holly (Michelle Williams) will spin out of control. The script by Goldbacher and Laurence Coriat paints Marina as spiteful from puberty on, her deceptions growing more vicious and unbelievable as the picture moves from the pair's 1970s girlhood into young adulthood. Goldbacher is adept at visual storytelling, capturing intimate moments with breathtaking acuity. She's also got a couple of spirited actresses in her corner.
Williams drops her ""Dawson's Creek"" persona immediately, mastering a middle-class English accent and kindly, mousy demeanor. The actress' manner fits a girl whose mother has told her, by way of comfort, ""Some girls are pretty, and some are smart."" Her performance is touching, heartfelt, and certainly eye-opening. She is truly an underrated actress.
Friel wonderfully conveys her sadistic character's tortured bond to her friend. She turns a scene where Marina tells Holly, ""There's no me without you,"" into something poignant instead of overwrought. Her performance is powerful, emotional, and beautiful.
Kyle MacLachlan (""Sex and the City"") makes an insinuating weasel as a professor who sparks romantic hopes in both young women. As Marina's cocktail- swilling mother, Trudie Styler (Sting's wife) cuts a glamorously wasted figure, the kind of woman who's great fun as your friend's mother and a nightmare as your own.

Much of ""Me Without You"" strikes a familiar chord and intelligently captures the difficulties that can disrupt even a close friendship. Goldbacher often spins her story against the backdrop of 1970s British pop records, including The Clash, Adam Ant and Depeche Mode. It's a wonderfully entertaining film that is true to life and gut-wrenchingly real. A wonderful little gem that deserves to be seen.",1050105600,24,2177,5.479166666666667
1878129,5,B000093W4U,"I thought they captured ""friendship"" perfectly in this movie.  The difference between infatuation, admiration, aqaintances and real, true friends is explored completely and very toughingly in this film.  It captured the importance of having strong family bonds verses neglective parents.  It brought back memories of the 80s-rebellion music days.  Perfect preformances.",1032307200,,369,6.176470588235294
1878130,5,B000093W4U,"This movie didn't need big action scenes, headbreaking stunts or a supernatural plot to be good. One should call a motion picture only movie when you are really moved by it. And this one surely is a big movie. Not the classical-tear-jerking-coming-of-age-stuff we're used to.
The strength of it comes from the actresses and actors in it. I was astonished to see how good both Friel and Wiliams were able to play the same characters in different stages of their lives. I especially enjoyed Michelle Wiliams performance (I admit, I already liked her a lot before I saw this movie), I never imagined she could be that good and convincing (and with a quiet Brit-accent in her voice).
Unfortunately this movie isn't out on sale in Europe yet (...hopefully yet).
