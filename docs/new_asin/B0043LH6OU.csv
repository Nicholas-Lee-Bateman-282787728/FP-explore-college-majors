8415098,3,B0043LH6OU,"This was my very first purchase thru Amazon.  The product was easy to purchase and I am pleased with the purchase for the price.  Although if it wasn't for the price I would have been unsatisfied with my purchase.  The seller mentioned that the DVD's were only used once.  Obviously thee sellers idea and my idea of a DVD only used once are completely different.  The first thing i did was verify the DVD's and although they did work, it looks like he may have used some for frisbee golf?  All in all, I am pleased with the service thru amazon and in the future I will be more carefull watching how things are worded.",1311120000,,617,4.321739130434783

The fourth season of Friday Night Lights was fantastic! It's a very important season of transition for the show as it attempts to move from the show we knew into the show it has to become. Rather than allow it to become a standard drama that repeats the same stories with the same characters the writer's decided to work on having characters we love move on in realistic fashion at the same time as they introduced us to and tried to make us care for new ones. To help ease the transition the writers wisely cheat to keep familiar faces Landry and Julie around for one more year of high school. Meanwhile Matt Saracen and Tim Riggins are both still struggling to get their lives started this season and they each hold some of it's strongest scenes in a season partially designed to give their amazing characters proper send off.

The show can never exist without the continued presence of Eric and Tammy Taylor at it's core to hold all the pieces together. This year finds the happily married couple facing much more daunting issues and problems than they have in any previous season. They constantly struggle to keep their lives, and the lives of the kids around them together. All the while Eric and Tammy seem to be continually punished by the community simply for doing what's right. The best thing about the Taylor's is rather than dealing with conflict within their relationship the writers keep them a united loving couple dealing with external conflict caused by life, which is much more relatable and realistic.

The fourth season consists of thirteen very strongly crafted episodes spanning one high school football season in the town of Dillon:

East of Dillon
After the Fall
In the Sking of a Lion
A Sort of Homecoming
The Son (*Fantastic Episode, deserves an Emmy)
Stay
In the Bag
Toilet Bowl
Lights of Carrol Park
I Can't
Injury List
Laboring
Thanksgiving

Special Features Included On This Set:

- Deleted Scenes

The special features are great and will be entertaining for any fan of the series to watch. While I wish there was more that doesn't mean we aren't getting our money's worth. I do however strongly wish there had been some mention to the individual storylines they crafted for the season, and I would have loved commentary on episodes 'The Son' and 'Thanksgiving'. Still, I'm very happy with what we're given here knowing that they made these special features specifically to please the shows die hard fans.

There are a lot of new faces this year with Vince, Luke, Becky and Jess but I find them to be great replacements for the cast that has moved on and honestly feel they hold just as strong storytelling possibilities as the original cast did. Vince is a complex character who slowly earns our respect. He and Jess already clearly have unspoken history together and Becky and Luke by seasons end have gone through one of the most difficult experiences that two teens can go through. Though no one will ever replace Matt Saracen as a wonderfully crafted and instantly likable character, these characters quickly grow on you.

I have always loved this show, even in the messy parts of season two, but this year was particularly great. They were able to tell so many different levels of stories and all while keeping the drama involved in them at a completely realistic level. In comparison with the fantastic first season of the series that taught us the uplifting message that ""Clear Eyes, Full Hearts Can't Lose"" this season goes out of it's way to teach us in the same uplifting way that ""Clear Eyes, Full Hearts Can Lose"" but what matters is how you deal with it and how you let it define you from there.

As the show moved to DirecTV and 13 episode seasons I found the writing return to the greatness we expected in the first season and with the excellent handheld camerawork and character acting that makes you feel as if you are right there watching what you feel are real people, Friday Night Lights now feels like a cable series that could become as great as The Sopranos, The Wire, Mad Men or Breaking Bad. This is a fantastic show and I'm ecstatic that this season has been released on DVD with some special features. It gets better each time I view it.

Hopefully many others will buy this set and watch the fifth season too, thanks for your time.

*On a small note I'm usually okay when shows have to change music for a DVD release but was really disappointed that they had to change Bob Dylan's ""Don't think twice, it's alright"" to another song at the end of episode 'Stay'. Guess I'll keep my downloaded version of that episode. Several other songs are also replaced with sound alike music and usually at key moments, just a heads up.",1307232000,2,5575,4.657171922685656
8415100,5,B0043LH6OU,"I have to admit, whenever I think of this show I think of life back in 2006 when it premiered.  I was at a pivotal time in my life.  This show was a breath of fresh air and it often reminds me of the girlfriend I had at the time as she loved this show as well.  Being that she lived in North Carolina and I in Atlanta, we both would watch the show every Friday and then go out and party in our respective cities. We would text each other all night and weekend about the show and what was funny and what hit home the most.  Being that we're not together now, I often think of her when the show comes on and she's communicated the same about me. In watching these episodes, it reminds me of that time with her.

This was a wonderful show. I am very disappointed it ended and not many people took to it. I can't say one bad thing about this show and how it was written / filmed. Hands down this show was one of the best series ever made.

Season 2 was more of a hiccup due to the Writer's strike, as all the shows were never completed.

The first 3 seasons chronicles the lives of Jason, Tim, Smash, Lyla, Matt, Landry and Tyra (along with Coach Taylor and his family). With Season 4 and 5 it chronicles new characters Vince, Luke, Becky and Jess.  Season 5  was more heartwrenching. What more can I say about this show. It was just great.  I have an empty feeling now that it is over with and there is no more anticipation for what else is to come. You want the best for every character and when something bad happens it almost hit home as you can relate to their struggles.

I've made it a point to share and tell everyone about this show who wants to hear about it. It's one of the best and I wish all the people and actors associated with it the best in their future endeavors. If you haven't watched this.. Please start with Season 1 episode 1.. and enjoy the journey as I have. I hope this will help you choose to watch 76 hours of one of the best shows that ever graced television.",1305504000,3,1985,4.077120822622108
