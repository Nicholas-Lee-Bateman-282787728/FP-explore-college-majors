The bad guys, the knock out weed and, beautiful girls, the love story, deception, beat down,  the crazy twins.  the brothers bent on having a block party, who could ask for more?  And a diverse party. Thumbs up for pulling it off so well",1515110400,,335,4.426229508196721

8161521,1,B000LC5AXE,"This is lower than low budget. This is no budget.
Besides being an ultra cheap production it also lacks an interesting story and humor.
A waste of time and money.",1405296000,,162,4.433333333333334
