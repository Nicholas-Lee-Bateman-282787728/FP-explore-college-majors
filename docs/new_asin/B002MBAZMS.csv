8373800,5,B002MBAZMS,"I have been waiting for this movie to hit dvd for years.
I was surprised by the price .You can get this movie from
Warner Bros website for only $19.95.
Why is Amazon making us by this dvd from a second party?
When I get this dvd I will write a review.
The wb website says this dvd has NOT been digitally remastered
for this dvd.
Hope this helps",1255478400,2,344,4.0
