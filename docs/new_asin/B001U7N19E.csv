3797056,5,B001U7N19E,"I bought the CD for when my fiancee and our daughter go up to visit her parents on weekends in New York (6-7 hour drive).  She enjoys the music and falls asleep but after time gets bored.  So before going up with them on a week I had vacation I bought the DVD and took a laptop with me.  Played it in a continuous loop for 4 of those 6 hours and it kept her entertained.

Also having the same video in many languages (in reality you pay for like 4 different songs/videos) it helps stimulate the mind and learn a language.  If she hears the English version too much she screams until we put another language on.",1248393600,17,610,4.135593220338983

3797152,5,B001U7N19E,"There is something about Mr. Gummy Bear that truly fascinates babies and toddlers.
If you're able to download the videos and convert them and upload them on your iphones/ipods or androids, you are sure to have a nice, quiet meal in the busiest restaurant with your baby or toddler distracted and entertained.
My son, my niece and nephew and other acquaintances' little ones looovvveee the videos. You can play them back to back for 1/2 hour or longer, the volume doesn't even have to be up, and they're mesmerized...
We have enjoyed many restaurant visits, and our son, starting at about 6 months until now (he's 2 & 1/2), will sit still and pay attention when Gummibaer is singing his songs.
Ahmaazing!!!!

No one could use a computer around him without a bear sing melt down(this is what he calls it Bear sing)!Even in his sleep trying to change his diaper or cover him he would be whispering ""I want Bear sing"" needless to say we got this for his birthday and once it was open the rest of the presents were done! I am happy to have a computer back and he is happy to have his ""Bear sing"" on his tv. He can sing almost every song word for word including the foreign language ones and loves to just play it and jump around sing and dance!",1289520000,2,587,3.983050847457627

3797216,5,B001U7N19E,"When I heard ""The Gummy Bear Song"" the first time, I assumed it was a commercial for candy. Our little convenience store sells German gummy bears. This evening, they had run out of them, so I had to rest contended with jelly nukis instead! (I'm consuming those as we speak.)

Then I saw the ""Choco"" clip on Youtube and was confused. Why was the gummy bear doing a commercial for cocoa? Was I missing out on something here?

It's a German novelty song, stupid!

Gummibr is a disco artist of that unimitable kind only spawned in Sweden and Germany. His ""songs"" became instant hits on Youtube, and has given rise to a little cottage industry. Of course, the songs are both silly and annoying, except for kids, who will drive you mad playing them all night long. Here's a tip if they annoy you too much: bribe them with a jelly nuki!

Essentially, Gummibr only made three songs: ""I'm a Gummy Bear"", ""Choco choco choco"" and ""Nuki"". However, our ingenious little friend recorded ""I'm a Gummy Bear"" in several different languages, including Slovak, Hungarian and (of course) Swedish. The Swedish lyrics are (almost) grammatically correct, but the bear seems to be singing them with a slight German accent! :D

Nobody will remember Gummibr ten years into the future, but as a funny diversion at your local day care center (or convenience store), it might as well work...",1269561600,8,1362,4.729957805907173

(The negative is that the gummibear's butt/tush hangs out and he grabs himself, so a heads up, this video does have a gummibear doing that...more of a PG, than a G rating...I wish I would have known, I would have preferred a filtered kids version).",1260057600,,352,4.430769230769231
