5011792,5,B006P0FF3Q,"For those who are fans of ""Pok&eacute;mon"", especially when it comes to the video games, there are always simultaneous releases of the games.  While they appear similar in gameplay, there are often a change in Pokemon or setting.  But what if they treated the films the same way?

In July 2011, children and fans of ""Pok&eacute;mon"" were treated to two different versions of the 14th ""Pok&eacute;mon"" film.  One titled ""Pok&eacute;mon the Movie: Black - Victini and Reshiram"" and the other ""Pok&eacute;mon the Movie: White - Victini and Zekrom"".  The plot of both film are the same, the major difference is one would focus more on the legendary dragon Pok&eacute;mon, Reshiram or Zekrom.

While the film was a major success in the box office in Japan, in America, both films received a limited 2- day theatrical release in select theaters in December 2011 and it would be the first Pok&eacute;mon animated film release since the 2002 film ""Pok&eacute;mon Heroes: The Movie"".  ""Pok&eacute;mon the Movie: White - Victini and Zekrom"" would later air on the Cartoon Network in February 2012.

And now, both films will be released in a 2-DVD courtesy of Viz Media.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Pok&eacute;mon the Movie 14: Black - Victini & Reshiram / White - Victini & Zekrom"" definitely improves in overall animation and CG with the latest film.  With each newer film, there is much better detail in the paintings and better use of CG.

If anything, more detail and vibrant colors, compared to the previous two Pokemon films, considering those the last two films, ""Pok&eacute;mon Movie 12: Arceus and the Jewel of Life and ""Pok&eacute;mon Movie 13: Zoroark - Master of Illusions"" look fantastic.

Of course, with this being DVD, you are going to see mild artifacts and some banding but nothing to bothersome and I doubt the children will even care. It's a beautiful looking film!

As for the audio, the audio is presented in 2.0 and 5.1 Dolby Digital. Dialogue is clear and understandable, special effects sound very good coming through the center and front channels. I don't really recall hearing the surround channels being utilized all that much but for the most part, dialogue and music are quite clear.  It's important to note that only the English dub is featured and the Japanese soundtrack is not included.

Subtitles are available in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Pok&eacute;mon the Movie 14: Black - Victini & Reshiram / White - Victini & Zekrom"" comes with trailer for both films.

JUDGMENT CALL:

As a father who has grown up with a child who enjoys ""Pok&eacute;mon"" and having been in Japan during the time of the Pokemon merchandise explosion, it's always intriguing for me to see how ""Pok&eacute;mon"" remains innovative and how it manages to attract the attention of a new generation of young (and older) fans for over a decade.

And with the release of both ""Pok&eacute;mon"" films, it's another way to attract viewers to the films as ""Pok&eacute;mon Black/White"" have done for those who purchased the Nintendo DS video game.  And considering the film made over $53 million in the box office, it goes to show that ""Pok&eacute;mon"" is not slowing down any time soon and the momentum and excitement continues to thrive as it did many years ago.

While both films have the same story, the key difference is how it integrates Reshiram or Zekrom to the film.  Especially the activity of the character of Damon in trying to revive a world that is no longer there.  With that being said, for me, I enjoyed ""Pok&eacute;mon the Movie: Black - Victini and Reshiram"" as it appeared to have a slightly different back story which I enjoyed more.  Once again, they are the same storyline, same ending but it's different in terms of how Reshiram and Zekrom are incorporated into the film.

But what I enjoyed about the overall storyline is the character of Victini, definitely unlike other Pokemon who are great fighting Pokemon, if anything...Victini is just overall cute.  And it's just fun to see how fun this Pok&eacute;mon can be, may it be eating macaroons or helping Ash and his Pokemon.  But there is also an emotional side to this film as Victini was tragically left behind by its owner and he is stuck in town due to a barrier and you realize how lonely Victini has been all this time.  And you root for Ash and friends to help Victini, but at the same time knowing that Damon needs Victini in order to revive the town, and unfortunately it's an ambition that can not only harm Victini but also the people that Damon wants to help.

As for parents who are considering buying this DVD for their child, there is really nothing violent about the storyline, while some younger children may find one scene where it looks like Ash got badly hurt (don't worry, he was just exhausted).

As mentioned in the video quality section, the film looks absolutely vibrant and fantastic! I would not be surprised if ""Pok&eacute;mon the Movie 14: Black - Victini & Reshiram / White - Victini & Zekrom"" someday receives a Blu-ray release because it looks so good... but as for the DVD itself, it does have its share of artifacts (as expected from a DVD) but nothing to disrupt viewing and for the most part, for the audience its intended for, I doubt they would even care. But this is the most beautiful Pok&eacute;mon film by far and each year, the look of the films just continue to get better and better.

Overall, if you or your child (or if you are an adult fan) loves the Pok&eacute;mon series whether on TV series, collectors cards or video games, I definitely recommend Pok&eacute;mon the Movie 14: Black - Victini & Reshiram / White - Victini & Zekrom"".  You get both films in one release and for the most part, it's a heartwarming family film worth watching and owning if you are a fan of ""Pok&eacute;mon"".

Definitely recommended!",1337385600,22,5818,4.7955911823647295

5011818,5,B006P0FF3Q,"EPIC Pokemon movie, featuring my favorite legendary, Reshiram, and also having Zekrom and Victini. it was also a very colorful film and great for all Pokemon fans. What sets this film apart from all the others was it has two discs, two different versions of the same movie.

the difference is Reshiram and Zekrom switch roles. In Pokemon white, Zekrom is the hero, in Pokemon Black, Reshiram is.

There's also mild differences. In Black you see a shiny Goler, in White you see a Shiny Hydreigon. It's an awesome film and it also has amazing artwork and graphics.",1384041600,,562,4.724489795918367
5011819,3,B006P0FF3Q,"I saw a steady improvement in the quality of the Pokemon films up to the three Diamond/Pearl movies but Victini and Zekrom/Reshiram feels like a big step backwards. The story centers around the small and unimpressive Victini, a thousand year old Pokemon with undefined but incredibly powerful capabilities. Besides Victini we also have the giant legendary dragons Zekrom and Reshiram who have been turned to stones following a long struggle. Victini reminds me a lot of Shaymin from Giratina and the Sky Warrior in that they are both small, seemingly immature Pokemon who are deceptively strong.

The 14th film is almost exclusively populated with fifth generation Pokemon which are often quite dull. As always Ash Ketchum has Pikachu but now his team is rounded out with a puny little Tepig and a ridiculous Scraggy. In a battle Ash's Tepig takes on a massive Samurott. I always have problems remembering which Pokemon types work well against another. Is bug strong against steel? But when Ash seemed shocked that his Cinder didn't have much effect on the fully evolved Samurott it was absurd. If there's one thing I can remember it's that fire is poor against water and Ash is supposed to be a veteran with a life dedicated to Pokemon battling.

The Plot of the movie is bland and overly complicated. Some guy wants to use Victini to resurrect Zekrom and Reshiram as well as make a castle fly but he isn't really a villain. I'm not even sure what his motivation was since the film lost my attention during the middle portion. Things go bad and the ""Dragon Force"" (whatever that is) goes all crazy and everything is saved by the power of friendship which is pretty much the way every Pokemon movie ends. Grass grows, flowers bloom and Ash goes on to his next Pokemon tournament *snore*.

What impressed me about the Diamond/Pearl films was the improvement in animation but this film just doesn't have the same quality. The designs are fine and there is some interesting and subtle mixing in of CG but there's also a lot of classic Japanese corner cutting here including the static bodies with moving mouths. The fight between Zekrom and Reshiram felt like a rip off of the fight between Palkia and Dialga except not nearly as well done. There was just nothing here to grab my attention or cause the film to stand out in any way. It's just so darn generic and forgettable. If this was the first Pokemon movie it might be interesting but it uses ideas that have been done to death in the Pokemon series and for a relatively short movie there is a lot of filler. Team Rocket is a perfect example of the kind of film this is. Their appearance is obligatory but they have zero effect on the story and never have any interactions with any of the main characters. It's all pointless and useless. I'm not going to say this is the worst Pokemon movie but the quality of the films now form a bell curve and this film is part of the downward slope.  If the producers are trying to go beyond the appearance of just a cheap cash in for a popular license this is not the way to do it.",1383350400,,3071,4.5883424408014575

5011833,5,B006P0FF3Q,"Forgive me for not liking Generation IV especially the movies but this movie comes off as fresh compared to those movies. The movie is similar to Pokemon Black/White in truth versus ideals (and the anime is going to take the same path with Ash meeting N). There is no villain in this movie. Just a misunderstood anti-villain that wants the best for everyone at the expense of harming Victini.

The movie draws some parallel to other movies but overall comes off as a surprisingly improved sequel to the Diamond/Pearl movies. My only gripe is that Cilan and Iris don't play a huge role and are just there in the background. Also, I was saddened that despite Reshiram and Zekrom being on the cover, they are only in the movie for 10/15 minutes.

Oh, there was one scene I loved in the Black movie. The scene where Ash pulls off all of these ninja moves in contrast to Ash running away from the falling debris was just hilarious/badass.",1358640000,,933,4.580838323353293

The second movie is so similar to the first, I did not even bother to finish viewing.

The two movies are basically the same with a few minor changes, certain Pokmon such as Golurk, are shiny (of a different color) in one but in the other, Golurk is its original color. The main villain uses either Zekrom or Reshiram, depending on which movie you are watching. Other than that, not too much is different. I gave it only a 4 star rating because the story is the same in both, it does not differ except for some slight changes. It also got confusing about halfway through the movie as to where the storyline was going. Overall, it was a decent movie but probably not as good as past Pokmon movies.",1344470400,4,672,4.384

I'm a huge Pokemon fan and own almost all (soon to own the rest, hopefully) of the other Pokemon series movies and to be honest I don't know if I could really give them a bad review.

To sum it up; if you're a Pokemon fan, like me, then you won't regret this purchase.
