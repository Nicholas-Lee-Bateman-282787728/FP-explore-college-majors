8741585,3,B0186EJ9NU,"This PPV is part of the second season of the ""TNA: One Night Only"" series which are just stand alone PPV events with each one having a special theme.  This was return of ""Victory Road"" to PPV with competitors facing off in matches with the winners advancing to a gauntlet battle royal for $50,000 & a future TNA Championship title match with Mike Tenay & Taz doing commentary on this show.

Austin Aries vs. Kenny King - Aries started out in control with various armdrags & grounding King while also eventually taking to the air only for King to resort to tactics such as mind games & taking advantage of his surroundings to get the momentum keeping Aries on the mat while continuing to taunt him & the crowd as both men went back & forth throughout the match.

Davey Richards vs. Bram - Davey used his speed to his advantage early causing Bram to resort to his brawling tactics in & outside of the ring while attempting to ground Davey as they traded momentum with Davey delivering strong strikes while Bram resorted to whatever tactics he could to break his momentum in favor of himself.

Kazarian & James Storm vs. The Menagerie (Knux & The Freak) - A reunion of former Fortune members with them resorting to classic tag team wrestling tactics in splitting the ring in half keeping their opponent away from his partner while working him over both individually & together while both Menagerie members resorted to using their superior size advantage with power moves tossing each man around the ring easily before one team had to use a page of our their old playbook from the past to get the win.

Samoa Joe vs. Lashley - Both men were evenly matched early before Joe was able to get the advantage taking Lashley off his feet only & work over him when he was down only with rapid strikes for Lashley to do the same in return with crossfaces while both men worked on wearing the other down with submissions & nerve holds along with some impactful offense in what was the most physical encounter of the night.

Mr. Anderson vs. Abyss - The fight began on the floor with both men brawling using the ringside environment to their advantage before it finally settled in the ring with Abyss keeping a slower methodical pace focusing on the head while using his own offense against him while Anderson kept trying to Abyss off his feet & picking up the pace throughout the match.

Bully Ray & Rockstar Spud vs. BroMans - It should be noted that it was during this time that Bully Ray made his intentions clear or putting Dixie Carter through a table which made for unlikely allies during this match leading to one entertaining moment after another such as how Spud was freaking out both BroMans when he kept trying to channel Bully's spirit or how Bully attempted to do the same teamwork he would with Devon only to have completely different results with Spud including what made Bully say ""WHAT IS THAT!?!"" when Spud went for the tables while both men had some funny antics towards the BroMans as well as this was all about the chemistry between Spud & Bully (and for those who saw Jokers Wild II knows it's pure comedy) and their interaction with the BroMans made this entertaining.

Gunner vs. Magnus - Gunner was seeking retribution for his TNA Title match against Magnus earlier in the year as both men were feeling each other out early attempting offense like a hammerlock or front facelock before Magnus took control grounding him working over the back using the ringside environment & submission attempts with Gunner starting to get more intense as time went on with each man pulling out one big move after another from a superplex to powerbomb as it came down to one man being able to catch the other.

Sanada vs. Ethan Carter III - We got some ""japanese translation"" from EC3 before both men went back & forth with Sanada keeping a fast pace with his diverse japanese & lucha libre influenced offense of aerial & athletic maneuvers while EC3 was attempting to ground & pound slowing the pace down as it came down to who was able to capitalize on a mistake.

Crazy Steve vs. Samuel Shaw - ""Crazy vs. Creepy"" here as both men played mind games with each other with Shaw turning his focus to someone else at ringside causing Steve to go into a series of unorthodox offense that included horns & balloons while Shaw himself snapped in a violent manner in what was a very short match but had both men play off their personalities well.

Eddie Edwards vs. Tigre Uno vs. DJ Zema Ion - The early moments of this match saw a series of interactions between all three men from lockups to headlocks with each man showcasing their own offensive on one or both opponents such as various takeovers such as the head scissors, top rope dropkicks onto both men, switching off repeated chops in the corner, moonsaults & twisting corkscrew planchas, how one aerial offense attempt was countered into a submission, various offensive spiking their opponent into the match, and the infamous tower of doom in what was definitely the match of the night filled with non-stop action from start to finish.

Gauntlet Battle Royal Match - This battle royal happened ""Royal Rumble"" style where a new competitor entered in after a certain amount of time with the last man standing receiving a winners check resulting in some moments such as irony behind the first two entrants, the final performance of an ""original"" in TNA, who's mouth made him the odd man out, which competitor was really ""freaked out"" by another, the awkward positions that happened between 5 of the participants, one man's dominate performance resulting in up to four back to back eliminations, who ended up being an honorary member of a tag team during the match, and the renewal of a rivalry between the final two men with a weapon coming into match as well resulting in an entertaining match that had it's moments.

This was one of those events that didn't have a bad unwatchable match on it as there was some average & solid wrestling along with comedic & entertaining moments but didn't have a match that was very memorable or worth going out of your way to watch.",1448323200,,6111,4.631578947368421
