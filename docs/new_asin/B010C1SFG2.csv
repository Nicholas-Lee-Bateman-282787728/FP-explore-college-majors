8721764,3,B010C1SFG2,"This product amounts to two reissues of Italian television broadcasts from the 1980s.  The first begins with a look at a Lohengrin production being rehearsed at La Scala and I found myself wondering why I had purchased this DVD--this portion of the documentary didn't seem to have much to say. There's a brief focus on Mirella Freni that illuminates little about her career or her artistry and we see her in excerpts of Falstaff and rehearsing Simon Boccanegra.  One does get a brief look at the young Claudio Abbado in action.  About 20 minutes into the program, there's a sudden shift to a piano rehearsal of Cavalleria Rusticana with Giulietta Simionato and Franco Corelli that made me think that, for this alone, it was worth the price of admission.  Simionato is on fire theatrically and vocally--this is what we miss on opera stages today!  It's only a short clip but quite riveting. There's another inexplicable jump to a truly marvelous clip of Maria Callas singing Vissi d'arte from Tosca.  The second half features an interview with Mario del Monaco in what is described as his Norma Desmond Sunset Boulevard villa.  The great tenor speaks very quickly about many topics and takes the opportunity to say that ""anyone can sing at the Met"".  Giuseppe di Stefano is then interviewed and has some insightful things to say about Callas and offers his assessment of Pavarotti (""Americans like tenors who can hit many high notes."")  I found it amusing that nearly all who are interviewed could never quite come up with the name Antonino Votto when discussing La Scala conductors.  In short, I didn't find these two documentaries to be particularly illuminating (the interview questions are rather predictable) but I enjoyed two brief performance clips that reminded me of the glory days of post-war singers the likes of which we greatly miss today.  All is in Italian with many subtitle language choices available.",1441411200,9,1917,4.959375
