941379,2,6304938713,"FOUR DAYS IN SEPTEMBER is a very subtle and understated film concerning, most specifically, the four days in 1969 in which U.S Ambassador to Brazil Charles Burke Elbrick was held hostage by the Student Revolutionaries, the MR-8. This is not an ""edge-of-your-seats Political thriller that is powerful and exciting"" (all of terms that critics use). Instead, this film is told in a quasi-documentarian style that examines the emotions of all that were involved in this kidnapping. The information is excellent and is positively necessary in understanding Brazilian history, but I found the film as a whole very claustrophobic and ultimately dull.",1181347200,4,643,5.376237623762377
941380,4,6304938713,"In March of 1964, democratically elected Joao Goulart was kicked from office by a right wing military movement, mentored and financed in the US. President Johnson had some US Navy ships at the ready to support the Brazilian generals if necessary, all this in the context of fear of comunism taking root in South America's largest country - the old story of the dominoes theory run wild. The Brazilian junta proved so brutal that students and intelectuals started resisting and doing the unheard of, at the time: Kidnapping ambassadors and consuls of powerful nations (US, Japan, Switzerland, Germany) and exchanging them for political prisoners that were being tortured and killed by the military. Brazil would not dare show its torture chambers or even admit to the practice much less accept international inspections to its jails - as a result the junta would simply give in and release lots of priosioners that would otherwise likely perish. Some of the release are now in government: President Luiz Inacio Lula, former Chief of Staff Jose Dirceu, former President Fernando Henrique Cardoso and many others. After 21 disgraceful years in power, the last general, Joao Batista Figueredo allowed indirect elections - 1985 was the year. The film does an excellent job showing the incredible conditions of those days. Alan Arkin is great!",1127692800,2,1337,5.137614678899083
941381,5,6304938713,"This movie faced a lot of criticism in Brazil for the liberties it took with history. Some criticism dates back to the publication of Fernando Gabeira's book, mainly the fact that Gabeira's importance in the kidnapping is overplayed. Other survivors from the operation claim he did not write the note to the press, as the movie shows. Also, a girl did try to get information from the Ambassador's security man, but she did not spend the night with him (and those who like to spot errors may notice the fact that he calls her by her code name, Ren, even though she introduced herself by a different name). And one just has to read other books about those days in Brazil to realize most torturers were sick animals, not guilt-ridden human beings like the guy in the movie.
In spite of all these flaws, the movie still works admirably as a snapshot of an era. I understand it was rather easy to sell this movie to the international market because Alan Arkin is in it and the event it is based on involved the kidnapping of an American ambassador. But it would be great if people all over the world could also see another movie titled ""Pra Frente Brasil"". The story is fictitious but inspired by actual facts: while the 1970 World Cup is taking place and the whole Brazilian population is glued to television sets, a guy is captured by mistake and tortured to death by the police. Brazil won that World Cup, so the whole country was in a celebratory mood while the horrors of repression were happening in the underground.",1085961600,12,1517,4.56043956043956
941382,5,6304938713,"I saw ""Four Days in September"" when in came out in U.S. theaters in 1999.  It has stuck with me since then, mostly because of Alan Arkin's fabulous performance as Ambassador Charles Embrick.  But, also, because of the way the film brings to light for its audience what life was like in Brazil during the miltary dictatorship of 1969 - 1979. And, because of its very understated manner of showing you how this small, underground group of anti-regimists coalesced, got its training, and put its thoughts into actions.  It all feels very real.  No Hollywood-ization here.
If you want an entertaining *and* eductional evening, rent or buy ""Four Days in September."" You won't be disappointed.",1085184000,2,687,4.947826086956522
941383,5,6304938713,"Based on a memoir of one of the participants in the kidnap of the American Ambassador in Brazil in 1969, this is a thought provoking film.  We all remember the idealism of the times and the student protests around the globe.  Most of it was aimed at governments, which needed reform, but were never the ogres that the protesters claimed they were.  In Brazil, however, it was different.  A military junta had just toppled a democratically elected government.  All civil rights had been suspended and terror reigned.
A small group of radical students became revolutionaries.  Clearly they were over their heads with their dreams of freedom.  A bungled bank robbery caused one of the students to be tortured and imprisoned.  Something drastic had to be done.  Several hard-boiled older radicals came to assist them and the plan for the kidnap was hatched. How it played out is the brought to the screen by Bruno Baretto, as all the participants from the student dreamer played by Pedro Cardoso, to the strong minded woman who saw herself as a revolutionary, played by Fernanda Torres, are shown to be both dangerous and nave.  Alan Arkin is cast as the ambassador and some of the scenes between him and his captors are masterpieces of subtlety and realism.  We see many sides of the problem, including the side of the young policeman who has nightmares because his job forces him to torture prisoners.
Instead of making judgment, the film lets the audience experience the realities of the situation, which exacerbates the harshness of the government.  The emotional tenseness never ceases and the audience is drawn into the drama.  As an epilogue it jumps to a later time, when the original radicals, now older and wiser are freed in a prisoner exchange.  As the camera pans their faces, we see how they have changed.
The film sets us down in a time and place that is gone now.  Times have changed and so have the methods of idealists.  There is something to learn, however, from this lesson in history.  It is well crafted, brilliantly directed and the actors are superb. No wonder it was nominated for an academy award.  Highly recommended.",1038614400,8,2140,4.816438356164384
941384,5,6304938713,"Brazil, 1969. The country is under the control of an oppressive military regime. A group of idealistic students join an underground revolutionary group in protest. Out of this climate of paranoia and violence, a bold plan is conceived: a plot to kidnap the U.S. ambassador to Brazil. This true story forms the basis for the excellent film ""Four Days in September,"" directed by Bruno Barreto.
I have seen many historical films, and this is one of the best. There are no cardboard heroes or villains in this film; there are lots of moral shades of gray. Are these students terrorists or freedom fighters? Is the ambassador an innocent victim, or an ally of oppressive forces?
Leopoldo Serran's intelligent script is based on Fernando Gabeira's book ""O Que E Isso, Companhiero?"" The dialogue offers thought-provoking insights into the minds of the individuals involved in these events. The cast gives universally superb performances; particularly impressive is veteran U.S. actor Alan Arkin as Ambassador Charles Elbrick. The film as a whole is well complemented by a memorable musical soundtrack. Barreto's direction is both suspenseful and sensitive. Whether you are interested in Latin American history or just enjoy a well-made drama, I highly recommend this film.",991958400,17,1265,5.267326732673268
941385,4,6304938713,"I knew almost nothing about Four Days in September when I cuaght it on cable T.V. tonight. I'm egyptian, so it is a rarity for me to see a Latin American film. It provides with the extra pleasure of seeing another  culture, one with which I was unfamiliar but was always curious about. The  story of this film, however is a common one. Young Idealists facing the  harsh realities and consequences of action rather than talk. You would  expect this film do be completly one sided but it shows great intelligence  when dealing with the Secret Service agent who can't sleep becuase of the  torture methods he uses on young revolutionaries, he calls them ""Young  dreamers"" who must be stopped becuase they are controlled by forces  greater than them. Ofcourse the movie doesn't take his side, but its rare  for a political film to be so sympathetic. The character of Jonas is also  fascinating, he orders the other rebels around and chillingly tells them  that he will shoot them if they disobey any orders. He does this in a  passive mannere suggesting efficiency rather than brutality, yet another  subtext is added to his character, when the American ambassador(wonderfully  played by Alan Arkin) observes that ""A man can hide himself in a  Revolution"". The ending is both sad and inspiring, the rebels do  eventually succeed in toppling the dictatorship, but as the gather togather  infront of an airplane waiting to deport them to Algeria their is a certain  pain in their eyes, the myths of hotheaded revolution dispelled and the  aftermath of violence setting in.",952214400,,1566,4.863636363636363
941386,5,6304938713,"I think this movie was fantastic, but, first of all, in order to understand it, one must watch it trying to understand the socio-political reality of that time in Brazil. I was born in Porto Alegre, Brazil in 1970  and lived there until 1995 and as a Brazilian Citizen who went through a  part of the historical period shown in that movie, I must say I thought it  was sad such a thing happened and even sadder the fact ""Four Days in  September"" portrays a true story.  However, I must also say that I am  very happy  that the Dictatorship Period, which started to be extremely  harsh in Brazil during the 60's, has not been thrown into an old trunk of  things to be forgotten. It is fantastic that we Brazilians are striving to  keep those memories alive until all the shadows of that period be  completely gone. Also, I must confess I thought it to be even greater that  the originality of one young man, ""Fernando Gabeira"", and the  courage and audacy of a few other young ""Comrades"" were able to  bend the Dictatorial Military structure of Brazil so fast.  A big kiss on  all involved with this project, specially to ""Cludia Abreu"" who  has been on my mind since she played ""Helosa"" in ""Anos  Rebeldes"", a Brazilian TV Series on the Brazilian Military  Dictatorship Period as well. May we never forget the 60's so they cannot  ever come back! Valeu, gente! Mrcio Padilha",935366400,12,1374,4.530612244897959

This movie describes a horrible time in their history and the desperate act that students took to get the media to pay attention to an out-of-control dictatorship.  I would describe this movie as balanced--while never condoning the kidnapping of the US Ambassador, it makes clear that this group felt that this was the only way to get their message out and get the world to understand the awful acts being visited upon the citizens of Brazil by their own government.",1426032000,,602,4.723809523809524

Brazil (a terrific performance by Alan Arkin) in 1969 by a mostly young,
nervous group of terrorist freedom fighters.

While not quite up to the brilliance of films like ""Z"", it has much of that kind
of growing complexity and power.

Most interesting is how the film keeps forcing us to re-think our feelings about all the characters
on both sides.

Perhaps a little obvious or on the nose at times, but packs a punch by the end.",1319500800,,501,4.606741573033708

7879775,5,6304938713,"I enjoy a good political thriller and over the years I have seen a number of them.  ""Four Days in September"" is of the quality of ""Missing"", ""Z"", and ""Seven Days in May"".  It does an impressive job of setting the stage and moving quickly to the core of the story.  The main characters and their motivation are always a key part of any good political thriller and this film brings this out very well.  This is impressive since this is a Brazilian movie about Brazilian political situations yet the circumstances are clearly presented so that foreign audiences can easily follow along.  There is an American angle to the film that is also well-presented in that it enables the audience to understand events from multiple perspectives.  There is action, suspense, and lots of good acting.  The movie comes to an end leaving the audience with a good postscript and a sense that we have had a unique experience.  This is one of those movies that left me somewhat exhausted.",1230940800,,968,4.686390532544379
