8166114,5,B000M3J6YG,"Please beware of pirated copies offered here. There is no NTSC edition of this title so if you see any Seller advertising as such you can be sure it is a cheap Asian bootleg. This exquisite Collector Box Edition contains all 8 seasons on 25 double layered discs not 38 discs as these con artists say.

It is formatted for PAL, Region 2 and require PAL or multi-system DVD player. It comes in a black box, not the red box shown on a picture surely posted by one of the dishonest sellers.",1172534400,48,486,4.282608695652174
