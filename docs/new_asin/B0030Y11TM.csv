4047629,5,B0030Y11TM,"I am an ex. Sgt. of the RAF, during the 1950's.  A Life Member of the BOMBER COMMAND ASSOCIATION !
Each disk is complete in itself. I just viewed last night a library copy. Excitedly buying my own today. And plan to give a copy to each of the crew survivors when I get their number. Informing the library order dept. that this is the only and finest coverage I have bught in 25 yrs of intense study.

  There is NOTHING like the content of these. First includes a suviver. Taken back to European crash sites. First time we are taken into little museums & see for example, the chared remains of a crew that had died on his mission.  Were fried sitting in place, as flying at only 60ft, it hit a pylon. Never (& I have the RAF AT WAR..which gives the training of every position of the 7 man crew)  in such a fantastic details.  The third is the ONLY FILM IN EXISTANCE made by the RAF in COLOUR, of a crew from the time they had their bacon and eggs(we only had one egg a week)..to briefing, studying for each position. Then the mission. Standing behind each one at work as tossed around above flack..

And never seen, debrefing of the hundreds of crews... but they are late.

How 2 officers stay with the NAFFI urn of tea, awaiting their hoped for return..  THE only film of such a mission, but in colour!

So aftr giving talks for half of my life to the public, this is a professional summation.  The most important 3 ever.",1360886400,2,1422,4.245353159851301
4047630,5,B0030Y11TM,"An excellent 3-disc set ! Very interesting for a person interested in the ""Dams Raid"". Lots of actual testing of the prototype bombs & A/C on actual period time footage. A great interview with Mr. Johnson, Bomb Aimer on one of 617 Sqdn's Lancasters that attacked the 3rd & last dam. Interviews with German people who were teenagers witnessing the raids that night.
Other pilots from the "" Dams-Busters "" also giving their views. The narration was great , even the little bit of studio animation was great of the A/C attacking the dams , etc. I really thought in my mind Disc 3 would just be a re-hash of often repeated clips but much to my surprise it is a full color documentary of life on an operational base. A really good look at base life from ground crew to air crew. The ground crew bombing up ,etc. The air crew briefing,etc & finally the start up of the engines , rolling to the active runway & take/off ! You've joined the crew on an actual bombing mission & back only to confront bad weather moving in but the day is saved with a bit of British ingenuity as you'll witness. A good look at the dams & country-side then & now , a little touching as Mr. Johnson meets people who were on the ground that night as their dam was being attacked. The actual discovery of Mr. Johnson's Lancaster buried in the earth in pieces & fragments, a story in it's own right I will not spoil for the viewer. Watched all 3 DVD's in one sitting , well worth the price ,the collection will be coming out repeatedly to view in the future, "" DEFINITELY 5 STARS "" ! A SPECIAL THANKS TO ALL WHO CONTRIBUTED TO THIS FINE COLLECTION,"" WELL DONE "" !",1338768000,4,1631,4.298701298701299
4047631,4,B0030Y11TM,"This is a great three DVD set covering the history of the British bombing of German dams during World War Two. Before watching these DVDs, I would recommend watching the single ""Dam Busters"" British DVD by Richard Todd, which is a dramatization of the dam busting preparation and raids:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dam-Busters/dp/B000H1RFSM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dam Busters</a>",1330041600,6,438,7.12962962962963
4047632,5,B0030Y11TM,This was a very good presentation by the History Channel. It takes both computer animation and first person bios and replays the events that took place during WWII's raid on the German Dams. This includes a recovery operation of one of the original bombers. A very good addition the the British movie Dam Busters.,1293321600,13,313,4.814814814814815

8386297,5,B0030Y11TM,"This being the 70th anniversary of the raid, I wanted more documentory material. I read Paul Brickhill;s great book growning up and actually visited the Mohne See dam in 1980 when you could still see the different colour of the stone where it had been repaired. The people who experienced this raid are dissapearing so any first hand information was great. I recently met an elderly gentleman at work with a thick German accent. When I asked where he was from - Essen - I noted on his date of birth he would have been 11 or 12 years old at the time.

I asked him if he was aware of the raid and he answered did he ever. Everthing was flooded  - he still remembered it.

I enjoyed the discussion as to whether it was a monumental raid or a side line - what rot! The raid told the Germans our side was going to win and the destruction was just one thing of a terrible war that they started. I somewhat disagreed with some of the German civilians interviewed who now seem so much against the Nazis. But the fact is that armed guards were needed when transferring shot down flyers not from escaping but from being lynched by the German civilian population. Canada executed several German civilian mayors and political officers after the war for summarily killing shot down RCAF and RAF aircrew.

I recommend this - great value.",1385942400,,1323,4.454545454545454
8386298,5,B0030Y11TM,I am interested in this raid and found the narration was both informative and humourous. Stephen Fry a very good choice to tell this story of heroism. Loved it!,1385942400,,160,4.551724137931035
8386299,5,B0030Y11TM,"Great graphics to a grand story.  I would have liked more on Sir Barnes, tho'.  The attack on the Ruhr dams is probably single, most destructive  attack on Nazi Germany when weighed against the number of attackers.  To rebuild, the Nazis had to pull resources from all over Europe, one of which was the Atlantic Wall.  If it weren't to the Dam Busters, the Atlantic Wall would have been much stronger and better defended on D Day.",1377475200,,430,4.532467532467533
