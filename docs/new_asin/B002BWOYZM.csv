8362169,5,B002BWOYZM,"I think this video is excellent. I have been doing tai chi and qigong for several years so I am not a beginner but, I do not believe you need to be very experienced to learn from this video. This video is tight and to the point (35 minutes total), the author shows you warm-up exercises then the main cultivation exercises and then cool-down exercises. There's not a lot of fluff here and all the commentary and visualizations from the author are very good in my opinion. If you are looking for a nice qigong routine then I think you will find this worthwhile. Thanks to the author for the video.",1326499200,3,596,4.378378378378378
8362170,5,B002BWOYZM,"Over 25 years of teaching these techniques has led me to take part with many other Qigong teachers to make available, quality training tools for the masses. This has and never will be a business. This is a vocation, a life's work and mission to help others. Some will like it and use it and some will not. We are all on our path.",1317859200,2,329,4.15625
8362171,1,B002BWOYZM,"This video is a very poor attempt to recreate an already great qigong video done by Dr. Jerry Alan Johnson.  The better video is called ""Chi Kung: The Healing Workout with Dr. Jerry Alan Johnson.""  I mean this literally when I say that the routine in the ""Daoist Five Element Qigong"" video is nearly identical to the one in Dr. Johnson's video only ""Daoist"" is performed by someone (Master Fahey) that does not appear to be proficient in the movements.  Dr. Johnson's video has been around for a long time on VHS and is now available on DVD found on amazon here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chi-Kung-The-Healing-Workout-with-Dr-Jerry-Alan-Johnson/dp/B000XEFQHA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chi Kung: The Healing Workout with Dr. Jerry Alan Johnson</a>.  Dr. Johnson is a dedicated practitioner of the Chinese healing arts and has been for a very long time.  This is apparent in his video through the quality of his instruction, his graceful/practiced/harmonized body movement, and by the proficiency that his students demonstrate on the video as well.  Also, Dr. Johnson takes the time to describe the importance of posture, body unity in movement, and much more where the ""Daoist"" DVD pays scant attention.  Don't waste your money on this video when you can buy Dr. Johnson's and receive a far superior product for a fraction of the cost.",1314748800,3,1384,5.469483568075117

But the Title of the DVD was exactly the material i was searching for when i decided to buy a Qi Gong DVD - so i took the risk.  I was really impressed with this DVD.  It definitely covers the 5 elements(Kidney, Liver, Lungs, Spleen, Heart) in some really simple and easy to follow exercises.  Master Fahey also guides you through some great exercises that is a great warm up leading to the five element exercises. I would highly recommend this to someone who has an understanding of the five elements but also someone trying to master the five organ system/practice in their Qi Gong practice.  Only discrepancy is that it says on Amazon that it's a lot longer than it is.  It's actually about 35 mins long but thats more than enough time to learn the exercises of the five elements.  I'm also looking forward to ordering some more of their DVDs from their main website.  Thanks Master Fahey!! - you are my new go-to Teacher :)",1287014400,6,1002,4.467032967032967
