8221929,3,B000W9VWVK,"Sonny Chiba did well in the sequel to Street Fighter. The plot was a bit different than the first, with a new line of bad guys, a new side kick, plenty of fight scenes and an old acquaintance that was a big surprise! There was a few attempts at humor in the movie, but just did not rise anywhere near the level of Jackie Chan movies. Chiba continues high quality martial arts moves with a vengeance towards any he considers his enemy. It was surprising to see where Chiba's morality and loyalty really lay, a nice touch by the director/writers. In the end, for its day, it was a solid action/martial arts flick worth watching at least once.",1418947200,,640,4.432203389830509
