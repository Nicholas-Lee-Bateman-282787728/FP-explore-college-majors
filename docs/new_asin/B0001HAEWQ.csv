8276003,5,B0001HAEWQ,"This is one of the cutest vintage skateboarding movies I have ever seen. Part documentary, part fiction, this movie shows you a teenage Stacy Peralta before he created the Bones Brigade in the 80's, skating some of the most gorgeous places in California.  If you've seen the movie Lords of Dogtown, you would love this film.

My only problem with it is Stacy's so called girlfriend. She's more of a narrator than an actual girlfriend, and she and Stacy have zero chemistry, they don't kiss in this movie once! But if you look closer, you'll realize that Stacy must have been really shy and innocent around girls, every time she held his hand, he blushed! It's cute!

Have fun listening to Stacy's extremely SoCal accent when he speaks, ignore the bad music and so-so acting and enjoy the great skateboarding. So it's cheesy, so what? It's the 70's, what do you expect? Highly recommended to anyone who loves the Dogtown Boys. One of my most cherished VHS tapes for sure.

PS: Jay Adams and Tony Alva aren't in this. It would've been way cooler if they were.",1481760000,,1057,4.636363636363637
8276004,5,B0001HAEWQ,I first saw this movie back when it came out on cable. Once I found this I knew I had to purchase it. Any boardhead needs to have this in their collection!,1389830400,,155,3.875
8276005,5,B0001HAEWQ,"If you thought that Dogtown and Z-Boys was a great document of the early years of modern skateboarding (which it was), then you need to see this.  This actually predates the footage of Dogtown, and some of the footage of Peralta in Freewheelin was used in Dogtown.  Yeah, there is a little hokey story line of Stacy and this young woman he was dating and teaching about skateboarding, but you can't deny these bits of extremely valuable footage:  Peralta riding around with his Zephyr shirt, on a 7"" x 27"" open bearing 1976 skateboard, absolutely shredding slides and wheelies with his great style.  Tom Sims, before he was sponsored, much less owner of Sims Skateboards, riding a loooong board.  Footage of great old secret spots such as the Tea Bowl and the Escondido Reservoir (someone needs to build a replica of that thing!), with Stacy just pumping and gyrating the place to death.  Footage of Mike Weed and Peralta getting excited about HITTING TILE, much less kickturning a pool.  A nice  segment containing footage of the almost lost art of slalom, with greats Bobby Pearcy, Hester, Turner, etc ripping a pick up slalom contest.  Great footage of an almost UNGRAFFITIED BALDY PIPELINE, with the legendary Waldo Autry shredding.  Man, this thing was made like in late 75 or 76, the most advanced equipment is early Fulltracks and Road Rider wheels, and the clothing is vintage 70's.  I might not recommend this video to the average joe, but if you are a skater, especially old school, you will  DIG this video.  And one last thing, I would like to take this opportunity to commend and thank Stacy Peralta for all he has done for the sport.  As a skater since 1978, if I were to recommend one skater for the Skateboard Hall of Fame based on ability and contribution, Peralta would be the first.",1093651200,16,1801,4.712460063897764
