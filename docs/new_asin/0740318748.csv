7788350,5,0740318748,"I had seen these movies around and decided I would finally watch one. After it was done I knew I had to watch the entire series. It was alot better than I thought it would be. Great entertainment with good moral teaching. It didn't come across as those ""perfectly behaved christian children"", but rather normal kids and their lives. I liked the way the movie got a message across without ""preaching it to you"". It wasn't like a ""christian movie"", rather a great movie that happen to have ""christian values"". My only regret is that I didn't watch them sooner, and that there isn't more of them other than the five!",1231286400,4,613,4.531531531531532
