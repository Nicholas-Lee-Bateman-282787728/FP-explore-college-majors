8014131,5,B0001LQL6K,It is an excellence movie about the truth of drinking and the consequences it has for people. Very true of the facts.,1391817600,,117,4.363636363636363
8014132,1,B0001LQL6K,This video is terribly outdated. The film looks to be from the late 70s. It talks about head injuries but doesn't tie it to drunk driving.,1381190400,,138,4.346153846153846
8014133,5,B0001LQL6K,I was terrified when my kids began to drive-so I got this DVD to show them what happens to other kids who drink and drive. Nothing graphic here. Just the results on the brains of kids who were in accidents due to drunk driving. Viewers are really affected. Good job.,1355702400,,266,4.34
