The setting is beautiful and really brings me back to being young and enjoying summers at the beach.  I watch this about 3-4x a year.  So glad that put it for sale on DVD.  I was waiting !!  If you like great romance stories, this is a must have.......",1155340800,6,360,4.461538461538462

2517581,5,B000EGEJIE,"THis is a great story - I read the book and loved it as well. A great light summer movie. And the scenery is a paradise!!!! Very well written, great actors. Will watch this one again and again!",1152662400,,193,4.105263157894737

2517583,5,B000EGEJIE,I've been waiting all winter for this DVD to come out. I LOVED the BEACH GIRLS MINI SERIES.,1146873600,5,91,4.111111111111111
2517584,5,B000EGEJIE,"I liked this series.  Rob Lowe was good.  You could tell it was an old series, but sometimes those are the best shows.  More and more series type shows are popping up and I think that is good and keeps people interested.  It was quite  good to see Chelsea Hobbs and Wes Brown on the same movie.  And she was the only one that Wes brown kissed.  Funny those two are on June in January  and he tells her off on it.  Can't believe Wes only kissed one girl on that show that we seen.  What's up with that.  I have several friends liked the movie also.",1424563200,,547,4.018691588785047

2517586,5,B000EGEJIE,"I have to admit that I get tired of seeing so much ""dark"" and ""death"" in movies that are out.  I feel that we people need to be uplifted to combat the onset of Clinical Depression.  It is important to have good stories.  It is important to have quality in what we view.  I felt like there was all elements in this movie that would make it a ""watch again"" movie.  I realize there are many differing opinions out there, but for someone who needs to be uplifted and just wants to immerse themselves outside of their own reality, this movie hits the mark.

I could relate to the characters.  The acting was believable.  The storyline was something that had uplifting moments but kept me intrigued as to how the particular problems were going to be resolved.  We really need to have more genuine human interest type stories in the movies that we watch.  I liked this mini-series a lot.",1407456000,,880,4.44375
2517587,5,B000EGEJIE,Met the author of the book (Luanne Rice) read the book watched the movie LOVED them all. If you love the beach and romance than its a good watch and read.,1394582400,,154,4.0

2517590,5,B000EGEJIE,"Who can resist Rob Lowe and Julia Ormond..?  A feel good, beach centered melodrama with just the right amount of schmalz, beautiful people, and gorgeous scenery.  It was a TV summer mini series from mid 2000.",1370131200,,208,4.75
2517591,5,B000EGEJIE,Purchased it as a gift for my daughter and she is very happy with it. She had been wanting this for a long time.,1362528000,,112,3.7083333333333335
2517592,5,B000EGEJIE,This was a great miniseries and wish it was a longer show. The cast was amazingly played and the story was a good one not alot like it.,1361145600,,135,3.857142857142857
2517593,5,B000EGEJIE,"True, it takes great liberties with the book, which I also like, but it is still a favorite of mine. I watch it once or twice a year. The scenery is beautiful and Julia Ormond is wonderful! I love her portrayal of Stevie and she and Rob Lowe were great together. I did not care for all the drama with the teen-age set but I suppose they make it more attractive for the younger generation.",1342137600,,388,4.1866666666666665
2517594,5,B000EGEJIE,I was very happy with my purchase from Amazon. The product was great and the shipping was super fast. Nothing was damaged everything was packaged nicely. Overall great product!!,1287878400,,177,5.137931034482759

2517596,2,B000EGEJIE,"I ordered this movie because I loved the book. So when saw they made a movie out of the book, I wanted to see it. This movie was nothing like the book. They took some parts of the book but totally changed it around. In the book, Nell is nine, in this movie, Nell is 16. Very disappointed.",1277683200,,288,3.9827586206896552

2517598,4,B000EGEJIE,"Picked this movie because of Chelsea Hobbs, turned out to be a great movie. As a single mother of teenage daughter I could relate to this movie and so could my daughter whom I watched the movie with. It touched on a lot of subjects just right. You never felt like they overdid that or didn't cover that enough. The combinations of personalities and expersience made for a great ""family"" movie.",1255305600,,393,4.549295774647887
2517599,4,B000EGEJIE,"The series wasn't quite what I expected, as it differed from the book quite a bit, but all in all, it was pretty good!",1251763200,,118,3.9583333333333335
2517600,2,B000EGEJIE,"I have always enjoyed watching Julia Ormond (maybe because my grandmother's parents were Ormonds, born in Sterling Castle), so when looking for films she was in I came across Beach Girls.  The other reviews all made it sound so wonderful, so I purchased it.  Much to my disappointment, the movie is more about the teenagers than Rob Lowe's and Julia Ormond's characters--indeed, I would consider their story line to be secondary to that of Chelsea Hobbs' character.  But I will admit that when they are on screen I enjoyed their performances and story, and the photography is very good.

Update--1 July 2008: If this review was not helpful to you, I would appreciate learning the reason(s) so I can improve my reviews.  My goal is to provide help to potential buyers, not get into any arguments.  So, if you only disagree with my opinion, could you please say so in the comments and not indicate that the review was not helpful.  Thanks.",1205539200,5,937,4.746913580246914
