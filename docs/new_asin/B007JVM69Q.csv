5091836,5,B007JVM69Q,"As a life long fan of Dean Martin, I also was very disappointed with the two previous releases that contained high lights of the Dean Martin show. This ""Uncut"" dvd is what we've all been waiting for. Nearly 50 years old and the shows still seem funny today. Even acts I had never heard of were still fun to watch as Dean usually made an appearance to chat or joke or sing with the person. If your a fan of Dean Martin then you will probably already be buying this, if your leery of the other two releases, have no fear. This is the entire show and well worth your money and time. I hope they release more sets like this. Very entertaining.",1339372800,14,639,4.203252032520325
5091837,5,B007JVM69Q,"I am absolutely delighted with my purchase. I grew up watching this wonderful show & purchased this strictly because it is UNCUT...I refuse to invest in DVD sets that promise ""The Best Of..."" only to realize the DVD producers' idea of ""Best Of"" is definitely not mine & these wonderful shows don't deserve to be destroyed by editing. I hope TimeLife releases more of these wonderful UNCUT collections.",1339113600,22,401,4.911764705882353
5091838,5,B007JVM69Q,"They FINALLY got it right, good job! A big thank you to Neil and the Dean Martin Family for working so hard on this, all us fans greatly appreciate it. Now keep them coming and lets get the Martin/Sinatra 1967 Christmas show out there!!!",1338336000,8,237,4.409090909090909
5091839,5,B007JVM69Q,"I received my Dean Martin Uncut set just last week, watched the first episode with Sid Caesar & The Lettermen as guests. (I plan on spreading my viewing out at least once a week as much as I'm tempted to watch them all in one siting, but I love the ""can't wait till next week's show"" feeling) And so far all I can say is ""Rejoice all ye Dean Martin fans and fans of variety shows from a too sadly far gone era, Dean is back!!"" Even though I felt Sid Caesar's comedy bits didn't quite hold us as well (and I'm a Sid Caesar fan), I was quite delighted and have no regrets sitting through the 1st of the six. Even though as of this review I can't talk about the remaining five shows, I had no problem with the mastering of what I saw. Considering the age of the video source, I think the producers of this did well with the one episode I did watch thus far. And I thought all the musical numbers were superb!! As the new week has arrived, I will be slipping in the disc for the #2. And something tells me I won't be disappointed.",1338249600,12,1026,4.059113300492611
5091840,5,B007JVM69Q,"What a joy to finally see some of Dean's old shows intact with no cuts!  And despite what one of our reviewers said, the video and audio quality is excellent considering the master tapes are over 40 years old.  It was great seeing the guest stars (and quite a variety it was), all of whom I remembered well, but I think as I am now not a kid any longer that I actually am appreciating some of them far more than I did at the time.  I was such a fan that I can actually remember sitting in Mr. Davis' biology class and not being able to concentrate because I was thinking that Dean was on that night.  And it's sort of the same now, because as each of these programs ending I would sit there for a couple of minutes and find myself still grinning with enjoyment.

Yes, with the old variety shows, sometimes you had to sit through performances of people you didn't always appreciate, but Dean's shows more than made up for that with the spontaneity and good-natured humor that was always there.

I hope Time-Life does more of these.  I'll buy everyone they put out and I relish sitting there and living the joy all over again!",1338163200,47,1124,4.298578199052133
5091841,5,B007JVM69Q,"Update: If anyone wants complete versions of Dean Martin's Variety Show released to the public, it is I, along with thousands of fans worldwide! I was so lucky to have been there at NBC, as a network executive, for every taping of Dean's Variety Show during it's nine-year run. There was nothing like Dean's show, and there will never be anything like it again. The stars and celebrities that walked through those doors were overwhelming! Even the folks behind the scenes were like a loving family. Dean himself was just as you saw him on the screen, and the bond that I formed decades ago is still with me today!

If it were not for Time-Life investing in previous Dean Martin show releases, there would not be this third installment of Dean's Variety Show on DVD. Mainly because of legal reasons, the previous two sets had some of Dean's songs edited out. Now, for the first time, six of Dean's shows from his nine-year span on NBC are able to be released with all the songs intact (minus one song which could not be restored from the original master).

It is with great honor and satisfaction that I have been able to help Time-Life, almost forty-some years later, to present to a younger generation what a phenomenon Dean's show was like. It's even a bigger thrill to bring back those wonderful memories for the rest of us ""older"" folks to remember.

Once again, Lee Hale is the ""hands on"" creative consultant on this DVD release. Lee was the shows' original (Emmy nominated) ""Special Materials"" person and Musical Director. Lee Hale was also nominated for Emmy Awards in producing and editing. Because of Lee Hale, these releases have all the original flavor and continuity of the original broadcasts -- only more vibrant with re-mastering of the ORIGINAL color tapes of the show.

The price is good on this set of six-shows on 3 DVD's. For more information on The Time-Life DVDs and Dean Martin himself, there will be an exclusive layout in the forthcoming Dean Martin Fan Center magazine. Check out the Dean Martin Fan Center online!

This set is the best to date of any Dean Martin Show releases! It feels like I'm back in studio 4 at NBC all over again!",1332892800,118,2162,4.649214659685864
5091842,5,B007JVM69Q,"UPDATE (6/21/12):

THIS JUST IN: One month after The Dean Martin Variety Show Uncut was released, The Golddiggers Super Site has learned exclusively that a 4th Dean Martin Show DVD set is in the works... Also: Guthy-Renker has pulled its Dean Martin Show volumes from the market (this time, forever)...Plus: The most thorough REVIEW and analysis of the new DMS Uncut DVDs to be found anywhere.

If you're a fan of Dean and his series and care about its future course, you won't want to miss our extensive coverage, which can be found simply by entering into any search engine the words: Updates/TheGolddiggers Super Site

ORIGINAL PREVIEW (3/23/12):

As those who have either purchased or simply read about past DVD releases of Dean Martin Show material are all too aware, many of the musical numbers from the original programs have gone missing from the home video editions, as casualties of the often prohibitively high cost of licensing reuse rights from music publishers, composers, and their estates. But fans of Dean's series who've long lamented this frustrating situation now have new cause to rejoice, with the imminent rollout of this forthcoming collection from Time-Life.

As its title suggests, The Dean Martin Variety Show Uncut at last delivers what Dino enthusiasts have long wished for: whole, unedited episodes -- in this case, 6 of them, drawn from the first 6 years of the series' run, digitally remastered on 3 DVDs.

Among the celebrated guest stars and familiar series regulars whose musical numbers will actually be shown in their entirety on these discs are: Cyd Charisse, Joey Heatherton, Caterina Valente, Barbara McNair, Zero Mostel, Leslie Uggams, Abbe Lane, Buck Owens, Buddy Ebsen, The Lettermen, Dom DeLuise, The Golddiggers and The Dingaling Sisters.  And of course, most importantly of all, every one of Dean's performances -- both solo and in tandem with others -- has been included.

The parties responsible for producing this set -- Time-Life, NBCUniversal and The Dean Martin Family Trust -- deserve major kudos, not only for responding to fans' desires for complete, unabridged episodes, but also for managing to bring these wonderful goods to market for a very low price. In fact, to truly appreciate what a superb value this package is, one need only compare it to Guthy-Renker's Dean Martin DVDs, which, while offering an hour's worth of admittedly fabulous segments per volume, cost $19.95 apiece. By contrast, Time-Life's newest effort, if purchased at Amazon's current pre-order price, yields a total of SIX unedited episodes for about the same amount as a single G-R disc.

For much more on the new Dean Martin Variety Show Uncut collection, including further details of the Original Air Dates and lineups of the episodes featured -- info that you won't find anywhere else -- just Google the title of The Golddiggers Super Site's exclusive article: Dino Vino Undiluted.",1332460800,168,2915,5.12

Well, some have trickled down here and are here on Amazon. I bought 2 last year.  There are more here now. If you enter Dean Martin it doesn't come up because his last name is not in the title.  Those who do see it think it's a compilation, it's not. It's 3 complete shows, 2 which have never been out. Take a look, even the new and used a great deal.

Whatever the reason, as an adult I've become a big fan of the Rat Pack, Sinatra, Deano, and their music, movies, and tv. So it's been a real treat to discover Dean's show. It's funny how the fact that Dean is ""winging it"" most of the time is what stood it apart from  the other variety shows of that era. Like The Dean, very cool.",1424736000,,483,3.878787878787879

Forget about YouTube, most of those full shows have now been deleted. I gave it four stars strictly because I was hoping for more of my favorites but the quality is fine, I wouldn't fault that.

5091907,2,B007JVM69Q,"I like Dean Martin and watched his variety show back in the day.  These are definitely not the best shows from his hit series.  Few (if any) of the guest entertainers on these six shows were any good...mostly just slap-stick, unfunny comic skits and dancing around with the Goldiggers.  Dean does justice to a couple of songs, but most of the other (dozen or so) songs are butchered-up by his goofy attempts to be funny.

There were a few redeeming moments though: ""yodeling"" George Gobbels was a treat as was a balancing act by a couple of weight lifters.  The were also a couple of unheard-of comics that were funny.  But that was about it for these six shows.

I remember a lot of really good episodes from The Dean Martin Show...with appearances by some of the best entertainers and comedians of all time.  I know it's too much to ask, but I sure wish they'd find a way to bring back those episodes uncut.  Now that would be a REAL treat.",1372204800,11,942,4.430232558139535

5091912,4,B007JVM69Q,"Time-Life, NBCUniversal and The Dean Martin Family Trust finally got their act together and released six complete episodes from Dino's 1965-74 variety hour. Admittedly, the selected broadcasts do not represent the laid-back series at its absolute best. Still, the three-disc set offers memorable performances by Martin and his diverse guest stars  unique talents we will never see again. A particular favorite is the January 1968 program featuring Dean's ""I've Got a Tiger by the Tail"" duet with Buck Owens and the magical presence of Orson Welles. Compared to 2013's prime-time wasteland (which lacks any trace of spontaneity), ""The Dean Martin Show"" delivers far more entertainment value.",1366502400,3,690,5.509433962264151

5091923,5,B007JVM69Q,"This is THE variety show I've been waiting for years to see released on DVD. I used to watch ""The Dean Martin Show"" just about every week with my dad, and watching it now makes it seem almost like he's still here watching it with me. There were plenty of other great variety shows on at the time, but no other host had Dean's smooth style, laid-back personality and Sense of FUN! Those of us who are nostalgic about NBC shows from the 1960's are so relieved the tapes of Dean's shows weren't ""wiped"" in the '70's like so many others were. I've never bought any of the ""Best of"" compilations available up until now, because I only wanted to watch the complete episodes, the way they were originally broadcast. That's the way you get them on this set, and it's wonderful to see the NBC peacock at the beginning and the ""chime logo"" at the end of each show! (My favorite moment: At the finale of Episode #2, when he realizes he's accidentally pulled off Eddie Foy's toupee, the look on Marty Allen's face was PRICELESS!!!)

For six complete episodes, you couldn't beat the price ($19.99, including shipping). I hope this set is a huge seller, because I'm looking forward to purchasing more volumes of complete shows as they're made available, and I hope to see episodes featuring guest stars I remember from NBC in the '60's: Don Adams, Barbara Feldon, Barbara Eden, Phyllis Diller, Don Rickles, Rowan & Martin and the two funniest guys ever, Jonathan Winters and Paul Lynde!

If any of the tapes have the original sponsor commercials and NBC promos on them, it would be great if they could be included in future sets, to add to the nostalgia. It has been possible to do this with other sets in the past, as in the case of VCI Entertainment's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Burke-s-Law-Season-1-Volume-1-First-16-Episodes/dp/B0013PVGGI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Burke's Law: Season 1 - Volume 1 (First 16 Episodes)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Honey-West-The-Complete-Series-Fullscreen-B-W/dp/B001B0H7DG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Honey West: The Complete Series (Fullscreen B&W)</a>, SOFA Entertainment's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Four-Complete-Historic-Ed-Sullivan-Shows-Featuring-the-Beatles/dp/B0000C3I2X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Four Complete Historic Ed Sullivan Shows Featuring the Beatles</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/6-Ed-Sullivan-Shows-Starring-The-Rolling-Stones-2-DVD/dp/B005LJTU7E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">6 Ed Sullivan Shows Starring The Rolling Stones / [2 DVD</a>], Image Entertainment's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Movin-With-Nancy/dp/6305836655/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Movin With Nancy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Naked-City-Set-3/dp/B000BZN1Q4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Naked City - Set 3</a>&nbsp;DVD sets, as well as Infinity's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mama-Cass-Television-Program/dp/B002C7ELR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mama Cass Television Program</a>, all of which contain all (or most) of the original commercials.

To the couple of reviewers who were critical of the picture quality of these episodes, I can honestly say the shows look great to me, just the way videotape from the 1960's should look, and I'm watching them on a 46"" HD 1080p flatscreen. There was no high-def video in the '60's and '70's, so people should keep this in mind. There's the occasional minor glitch (certainly nothing that would detract from the shows), but the colors are vivid, and the sound quality is great, too!

Mr. Neil T. Daniels, in case you or anyone connected with NBC happens to be reading this, I have a request (actually, a plea). This isn't directly related to ""The Dean Martin Show"", but it's still NBC-related, nevertheless. There are a LOT of us who grew up watching TV in the '60's who are wondering if the ""streaming theater marquee lights"" intro to ""NBC Saturday Night at the Movies"" still exists on tape or film somewhere in NBC's vaults, or in a private collection. This seems to be the opening title sequence that baby boomers want to see the most; it was always very exciting for us to watch every week as children. NBC probably doesn't have any idea how fondly remembered and sought-after this particular intro is; if there's any doubt, just do a Google search for this sometime and read all the comments. I hope NBC wasn't so hard-up for blank tapes in the '70's that they destroyed this wonderful 30-second intro. If this was the case, please let us know and we'll stop asking. If it does still exist, would it be at all possible for this intro, along with the ""drum roll"" bumper that preceded the commercial breaks, to be included as a bonus extra on one of the NBC-related DVD sets, possibly one of the Dean Martin sets? We KNOW there would be copyright issues with the theme music, we know that. But if these issues could be worked out to the satisfaction of everyone concerned, I'm confident most of us would be willing to shell out an extra buck or two per set to cover the licensing costs. Please seriously consider this request.....It would be the ultimate bonus feature of any NBC set, and possibly the late '60's ""Monday/Tuesday Night at the Movies"" intros could be included on later sets (all following the NBC peacock, of course!).....Thank You!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dean-Martin-Variety-Show-Uncut/dp/B007JVM69Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dean Martin Variety Show Uncut</a>",1358640000,4,5762,6.145161290322581

5091925,5,B007JVM69Q,"What more do you want? Probably more will be the answer after viewing these wonderful, timeless shows from The Dean Martin Show, certainly one of the best, if not the best, variety show from the classic years of the 1960's and '70's. There are 6 ""uncut"" episodes, spanning the years 1966 to 1971, and all of them have enough special moments, great singing, and comic gems to make this purchase a MUST for Martin fans. ALL of the guests listed are here, so I was bemused from some of the negative comments. The picture and sound quality is VERY GOOD to EXCELLENT throughout. The ENTIRE shows are here and there are even the commercial breaks with Dean's picture and the announcer stating, ""and tonight's sponsor is ..."" and you get to hear the music playing without the commercials. Wonderful. You will be transported back to an era when TALENT mattered - real talent. There are moments when Dean is clearly clowning through a song, but others when he is fully engaged - and the performances are often moving. Most of the comic bits hold up well, especially when it's clear that Dean, perhaps underrehearsed, is having a grand time ""improvising"" through a scene, which keeps the comedy fresh and appealing all these years later. ""The Dean Martin Show"" began in 1965, barely 10 years after his split from Jerry Lewis, but you can see Dean actually doing some ""Jerry"" in his comic routines. The guests range from Sid Caesar, to Bob Newhart, to Joey Heatherton, and all of it is remarkably ""modern."" You get a show from his very first season and the DVD's end with a show from 1971, one of the last real seasons of the show before the show became almost weekly ""roasts"" of other celebrities. For the price you are paying, which is rather low, 6 uncut episodes of this incredibly entertaining show are worth the price and you can just hope that others will follow. The best part of the show, for me, is still when Dean jumps up on the piano, with Ken Lane playing, and proceeds to spend a few minutes making fun of classic songs, with different, funny lyrics, and then sits on the couch and proceeds to craft a song with his impeccable phrasing and tone. He was a gifted singer, terrific straight man and comedian and actor, and a legend. No one even remotely like him today. No one quite this fun. And how we miss his great talent. You can experience it again here and it's well worth it. FIVE STARS!",1358208000,3,2396,4.548611111111111

5091941,5,B007JVM69Q,"Well, I guess the folks at Time-Life and the Dean Martin Family Trust - heard the word when they released the ""Best of"" compilations last year. Nearly everyone was glad the shows were out but really annoyed that they were cut. When you saw the finale of a show and one of your favorite entertainers was there but not actually on the DVD, it became frustration.

Well, now that issue has been resolved with this (hopefully FIRST in a series) of ""Uncut"" collections. (Only the commercials are missing so each runs about 50 minutes.). Now the show makes more sense with the proper pacing from beginning to end.

The Dean Martin Variety show was one of the last of it's breed presenting diverse performers on each show. One example is show #0820 from January 1968 where we get the sex-kitten singing and dancing of Joey Heatherton only moments away from Bakersfield-country performer Buck Owens and that follows (by only a few minutes) the great Orson Welles reciting a scene from "" The Merchant of Venice"". Welles returns later to perform some magic with Martin. Not all the acts hold up well (this show had comedian Bob Melvin doing some pretty stale jokes), and one episode even includes David & Goliath, a strongman act, but Martin is in top form throughout, often appearing to ""wing it"".

If I find fault with watching these old shows it's that they used a pre-recorded laugh track that makes the laughs seem forced. They are still using LTs for shows like ""The Big Bang Theory"" which would be funny with out the track. I guess it's a personal preference but laugh tracks bug me.

This volume of the show (I note it is not titled with a volume number) contains six ""complete shows"" The video quality is passable though not sharp - do to the age (and I'm guessing) storage of the original tape masters. But Dean is hilarious whether he is in focus or not and some of the ""smokiness"" may be due to the cigarettes that seem to be attached to his fingers.

So, the folks at Time-Life have redeemed themselves this time and hopefully more volumes will see the light of day.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
