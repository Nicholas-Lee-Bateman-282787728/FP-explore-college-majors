7431842,3,B0159OSR24,"""I saw him beat someone badly, just for talking to me."" Leah (Lathan) and her boyfriend have different plans for the future and decide to split up. When she meets the charismatic and charming Carter (Ealy) she easily falls for him. He says and does everything perfect, but when she sees his dark side things change. Afraid of what he may do next Leah breaks up with him, but Carter doesn't let go so easy. This is a really good movie that could have been so much better. The movie gets really close to the tenseness it is striving for, but ends up falling short. Carter does do some very scary and terrifying things, but nothing that hasn't been seen before. The movie really left a lot on the table that would have really helped it out and made the movie as tense as the filmmakers wanted it to be. The movie is good and I liked it better then No Good Deed, but it was just too clich to really have the impact it wanted. Overall, not bad and worth watching, but not as tense as it could have been. I give it a B-.",1451260800,2,1014,4.178571428571429

7431844,5,B0159OSR24,I loved this movie! It was exciting and had twists you didn't expect. I've been waiting and waiting since I saw it in the theater for it to come out on DVD so I can buy it! Even my husband really liked it and he doesn't like maybe newer movies.,1450742400,,244,3.9
7431845,5,B0159OSR24,"I absolutely love this movie!! Yes, there are spoilers in the previews and the plot line isn't entirely new. However, the cast and crew did a great job with putting a fresh spin on this topic and developing a roller coaster of a film. Some of the scenes were very intense, and I jumped out of my seat at least once. And there are definitely things I did NOT see coming! I love that it wasn't a gory film, and that the main character (played by Sanaa Lathan) isn't a helpless mess. Micheal Ealy is very easy on the eyes, too. Lol. This is a movie I could watch again and again :)",1448668800,8,578,4.123893805309734

The cast is great in the movie - you'll smile, laugh and cry - then be scared out of your mind.",1446940800,7,366,4.112676056338028
7431848,3,B0159OSR24,"INCLUDES PLOT SPOILER IN TRAILERS.

Lea (Sanaa Lathan) has the prefect boyfriend (Morris Chestnut) except he doesn't want kids. She meets another perfect man Carter (Michael Ealy) who drinks the same coffee as she does. She dumps one for the other and soon discovers Carter has some anger management issues and doesn't take rejection that well. This then turns itself into a mediocre stalker film adding nothing new to the genre.

The film starts off really slow and takes awhile to get to the meat of the film. They could have shown some negative background on Carter to hold our interest, but that would eliminate the surprise plot spoiler element they put into every trailer anyway.

Guide: No nudity. Minor sex scene. 1 F-bomb near end.",1443916800,7,740,4.857142857142857
7431849,3,B0159OSR24,"The Perfect Guy is an uninspired thriller that coasts on its overqualified cast.  Sanaa Latham was the best part of Alien vs. Predator, and she's one of the best parts of The Perfect Guy.  She plays Leah, a driven woman who has a great career, great house, and great boyfriend (Morris Chesnut).  But Dave isn't ready to get married or have kids and Leah is tired of waiting.  I liked how Latham played her heartbreak as she made the hard decision.

Three months later, and Leah has found another man: Carter.  Michael Ealy has an amazing smile and loads of charisma, so it is little wonder that Leah would fall so hard, so fast.  Especially when she takes him to meet her parents and he's ridiculously charming.  However, when she witnesses a sudden violent episode she's not willing to stick around and see if it is a one-off or if he'd ever direct that anger at her.

Spoiler alert: he would.

What follows has very little tension.  Ealy is inspired casting, because his pale blue eyes can look quite creepy indeed and he plays the change in energy for his character perfectly.  Most of the other cast members are wasted.  Leah's parents only appear the once, and her two best friends are little more than props for Leah to tell her thoughts too.  There is a cop who gets a bit more to do.  The Perfect Guy did do a good job of showing how difficult it is to build a stalking and/or harassment case.

I did enjoy seeing The Perfect Guy in the theater because the audience I saw it with was very responsive.  It's hard to describe the sound everyone made when Carter stuck Leah's toothbrush in his mouth, but it was the exact sound that scene deserved.  (That was definitely one of the movie's most memorable and original scenes.)

The Perfect Guy is a route thriller.  If you like that sort of thing, it does have an appealing cast.  But I'd say this is one to catch when it comes on late one night or to rent from the library.  It's not a movie I'd pay full price for.",1442793600,9,1971,4.386740331491713

7431919,3,B0159OSR24,"I loved previous movies by each of the leading actors, but this particular script didn't offer any one of them much to work with in order to showcase their talent. The character development is limited and one-dimensional, and I wasn't sold on the chemistry between the leading actors like I was in their other works.

This is a clichd crazed ex-boyfriend stalker movie, kind of what you'd see on the Lifetime network. The plot and storyline are very basic, and almost completely predictable.

Overall, the actors worked with what they were given, but the writing was much too basic for these seasoned actors. We're just used to seeing each of them in much more complex storylines.",1484524800,,680,4.853448275862069

7431935,4,B0159OSR24,"While I don't usually like J-Lo movies, Enough(and U-turn, although R rated and having some mature stuff mixed in) isn't one of the ones I'm talking about. ""Enough"" has Lopez getting abused, then--through WELL-THOUGHT-OUT planning and with the help of her conveniently placed daddy--turning the tables on her attacker: her husband.

This movie does the same thing in a different situation. Lathan gets stalked(similiar to attacking), then through planning she turns the tables on him. If you make a movie that's got a woman beating a man in a fighting match, then she has to have some stipulated advantages over him: J-Lo takes special training, puts metal rings on her fingers for MAX affect, uses steeltoe boots, etc. J-Lo also uses the fact that her husband was ""big-time"" and she was ""small"". Lathan's indignant streak eventually comes out, where she purposely fuels Ealy's insane temper to bait him into a trap(based on her cop acquaintance's--who by this point didn't like him about as much as her--info). That cop info will tell you how the 2 movies are similar in that respect: you'll see how Lathan's coup de grace is right for her situation. Basically, the same as ""Enough""--only it will seem new to most viewers. Pretty good movie--only the landlord's demise seemed only possible if a person could not handle stress at all(possible) and the end was a little too sloppy. It needed a great Lifetime ending(NO FRILLS), but instead opted for ""Enemy of the State"". The ""Enemy of the State"" ending was tailormade for that movie, but not right here. It's supposed to be simple.",1482105600,,1581,4.943609022556391

7432027,5,B0159OSR24,"Leah & Dave are in a relationship.  Leah wants a husband and kids.  Dave, because his family are just about all divorced, don't.  Breakup time.  Then, Carter comes in the mix and Leah is on seventh heaven....until one night at a gas station.  From there, she is afraid and the law won't help her, because she hasn't been physcially attacked.  Yet.  It seems that Carter's good looks can't hide the obsessive hell in his heart for Leah.  He wants her....BAD!  With Sanaa Lathan, Morris Chestnut & Michael Ealy as the principle characters in this stalker flick, they may not have brought anything new to the genre, but the fact that they are all african-american gave this a racial spin that I approved of.  I will admit, I didn't expect what happened in that scene with Morris & Michael, but that just gave the movie creedence.  DUG THIS FLICK!!!",1461024000,,845,4.641891891891892

Michael wants to possess her. Sanaa is wonderful as the damsel in distress who isn't going to take it anymore. Nothing really new in this story or plot but the attractive and talented cast make it better than most.

They miss the point of the movie::: some people wanted more sexy or sex scenes since it has a romantic theme.. i say be quiet and go watch a porno for more steamy / sexy scenes which you though this movie lacks. clearly the movie focuses on the frustration of a stalked victim. Also, the desperation of some single women makes them blind to all the warning signs that a no good man shows in the beginning::: ( the inability to make or keep friends, troubled relationship with parent(s), his messy living conditions, acts way too nice till he seems too good to be true /  fake personality, too need / demand too much attention, lashes out when things don't go his way, cannot easily admit to mistakes or down play his s***ty behavior)....... i can go on for days but you have to watch the movie to see the warning signs in the beginning of the relationship.",1455667200,,1028,4.410526315789474

This was a movie I expected a great all around suspense since they brought it with the cast. Sure I knew it was the typical obsessed murderer; but they usually earn their crazy.
Example? Who is an executive living alone in a lavish home without any form of home security?  That's living 101 at the minimum. Fine,  even if she didn't have it before the obsessed ex, who gets a restraining order but still no home security? Still leave your key in a hideyhole that crazy knows about? Or use your poor elderly neighbor as your watchdog instead. Let's not lock the sliding glass door? IT guru, so let's not at least lock your computer just in case.
I gave it 3 stars for the actual movie actors making it tolerable, but by the end I wanted Sanaa's character to die for being the dumbest bish on the planet.",1454112000,,962,4.30939226519337

7432187,2,B0159OSR24,"The movie is not well written, the actress/actors are the best thing in it but the story is so poorly executed that there is no suspense and the writer generates little interest in the characters. technically competent, it's in focus, editing is competently done and the sound is okay, but an uninteresting and poorly told story. I think what I disliked most was the differences in the heroine's professional and personal life. In her professional life she is shown to be competent, successful, hardworking, solid middle class with a nice car, a very nice home. She's beautiful and in the prime of her life, but she's not particularly proactive in her love life, and as she wants a husband and she's beautiful enough to have a wide pool to chose from, I don't see her casting her net wide, but rather dealing with what life presents to her. How can she be competent at work and yet fail to vet her personal life. When she goes to the police and they explained their process to her, why didn't she hire a private investigator, or even security temporarily, something she could clearly afford to do. Also, the police officer she dealt with behaved, in my opinion, as they might've with an impoverished person, not a relatively well off person. Middle class people see a different side of the law, in my opinion, than poor people. Lastly, when she shot and killed her stalker and then showed up at the police station with the gun, 100% unbelievable that a person who'd just been in a struggle for their life, and who had just killed someone, would behave in such a way. Calling 911 would've been the first act post survival and if her phone had been taken out (I skipped around by that time I was so exasperated with the story), then she had neighbors whose phones she could've asked to use. She shot the intruder yet apparently none of her neighbors heard the blast and called the police, though the houses in the neighborhood were close to one another. Story just failed to work on most practical levels. one and half stars rounded up to 2 as the actress/actors did the best they could, and the film is technically competent.",1453420800,7,2124,4.6068601583113455

I figured it was just another mediocre stalker movie,and maybe it would've been except for one thing..it had a great villain!!!!!!  Micheal Ealy was just plain creepy and looked creepy and his performance along with Mrs Lathan
(and the gentleman that played the cop) made this a very,very enjoyable movie. For those that said this movie put them to sleep..maybe they were already sleepy. When I watch stalker movie or suspence movies,or horror movies,I want a good creepy believable villain,and Mr Ealy was all that and more!!!!",1451865600,,598,5.164948453608248
7432222,1,B0159OSR24,"Waste of my Sunday.  This boring thriller nearly put me to sleep. There is absolutely no character development, no reason to like or admire any of these characters and the storyline is insanely predictable and boring.",1451779200,3,217,5.027777777777778
7432223,2,B0159OSR24,I rented this title from red box and I was so looking forward to seeing it. Turns out this dvd was basically lack luster. The plot of this film has been done a million times before and so much better. I would have been really disappointed had I paid to see this at the movies. I didn't think enough suspense was built. I didn't really feel the chemistry between the actors. There was no twist to the movie so it was totally predictable (which leads to boredom) . I just thought it left alot to be desired. This film just screams lifetime movie network. I would honestly give it two and a half stars.,1451692800,,599,4.2631578947368425
7432224,3,B0159OSR24,"The Perfect Guy is a yet another variation on the boyfriend from hell thriller. Leah (Sanaa Lathan) is a career woman who appears to have it all: a lovely home in Los Angeles, an important position in a political consulting firm, and a handsome boyfriend, Dave (Morris Chestnut). But her relationship with Dave has had its downside. She wants marriage and a family. He doesnt. Eventually, she breaks up with him and immerses herself in work.

At a bar, she is offered a drink by an overly pushy guy and seems cornered. Another patron, the handsome Carter (Michael Ealy), comes to the rescue posing as her boyfriend, and tells the aggressive bore to back off. Grateful, Leah accepts Carters invitation to dinner. She is charmed by his excellent manners until Carter savagely beats a man merely because he talked to her. Clearly upset, she breaks it off with him only to find that he simply won't take no for an answer. He begins to harass her, spy on her, and behave in such a creepy way that she fears for her life.

The film covers similar ground to such movies as Fatal Attraction, The Boy Next Door, and Fear, with a plot staple that usually makes for a reliable thriller. Here, however, the script is sub-par and predictable. Theres little attempt to layer the film with surprise revelations or twists, so we go down a familiar cinematic path, practically numbed by the time final credits role. Lathan, Ealy, and Chestnut do their best, with Ealy particularly menacing in several scenes, but The Perfect Guy offers little else to distinguish it and fails to be worthy of their performances.

The only bonus extra on the Blu-ray release is a behind-the-scenes making-of featurette. A digital HD copy is included. The film is rated PG-13.",1451692800,,1740,4.754966887417218
