8536139,5,B0095HHOP8,"#1 This is NOT the British version of House.
#2 You MUST have a region-free player to play this (or a region 2 DVD player)

All of the characters are interesting and watchable; the script is excellent; the acting if first-rate; the music is good to excellent; and the details of a British hospital and medical jargon and procedures all appears to be done perfectly (however, the British medical system and its innumerable problems are never addressed--and that may be due to the specialties involved here).  This is probably the best looking British show that I have every seen.  I know they spent a lot of money to make this look right.  You never feel as if you are looking at a ""set.""

Now, for the negatives.
1. Monroe seems to have changed personality somewhat since series 1, and this could be due to events of series 1 or a change to make him more likable.
2. For people whose Christian faith is not mentioned, they do seem to say the Lord's name a lot (say twice per episode?).  The profanity and swearing is not overwhelming, as is found on a Showtime or HBO show.
3. This is a very short series and there is no series 3.
4. There are enough adult situations to limit viewing to those 16 or 18 or older (depending upon your own values).  Again, unlike Showtime and HBO, I do not recall any nudity nor do I recall any sex scenes (although there are adult themes like adultery).",1467417600,,1385,4.429133858267717

8536141,5,B0095HHOP8,"LOVE IT!  Great writing, great cast, great production teams! No, this is not House, it is better!  House was all talk with little action--none of the episodes I saw (lost interest, didn't watch entire series) ever had him in surgery.  Monroe has great characters portrayed by great actors ... loved Monroe & Sheperd, disliked Bremner & Springer (as the show intended). This show should come back!",1424390400,2,396,4.96969696969697
8536142,4,B0095HHOP8,"However, if you are looking for HOUSE, you won't find it. Mainly because no one call fill Hugh Laurie's shoes.
Similar plot twists so it definitely trying to imitate HOUSE without having Gregory or 13!",1389744000,2,201,4.771428571428571
