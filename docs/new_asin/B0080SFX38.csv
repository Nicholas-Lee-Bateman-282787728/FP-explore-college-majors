For people like me unfamiliar with the history of post-WWI Ukraine, it's hard at first to tell who's who and what's going on.  It prompted me to read about the period, which is a good thing.  Helps understanding of current Russian-Ukraine divide.",1519084800,,328,4.927272727272728

8523789,5,B0080SFX38,"Very well done, but at the same time very complicated plot that would be very difficult to decipher for those viewers with limited understanding of the history of Russia, Ukraine, Bolshevik revolution and so on. Complicated relationship between Russians and Ukrainians; this love-hate emotions on both sides of the nationalistic equation is craftily woven into the fabric of this great miniseries.",1478736000,4,397,5.524590163934426
