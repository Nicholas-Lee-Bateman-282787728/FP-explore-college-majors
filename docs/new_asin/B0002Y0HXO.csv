8034367,5,B0002Y0HXO,"I love it, especially the abs exercises, which resulted in already feeling loose around the waist. The upper body routine is also very effective and resulted in more shaply arms. The DVD convinced me I had to have everything David, and I have NOT regretted the purchases. He keeps me motivated every day and working towards a toned body and ""sound"" mind (no kidding).  I have used many personal trainers, but the very reasonable cost for his DVDs and books is worth 1000times more than most of the useless trainers.",1154044800,,515,4.722222222222222
8034368,1,B0002Y0HXO,"I'm sorry, David Kirsch is no motivator like Billy Blanks or Kathy Smith...too basic and completely BORING. Do not waste your money- instead for a really good weights (all round and in segments of arms, legs, butt, abs, plus extras) DVD buy Kathy Smith's Lift Weights to Lose Weight 2.",1129334400,4,285,4.72
8034369,2,B0002Y0HXO,"I had heard that this guy is tough.  Well it certainly didn't show here.

As an avid watcher/do-er of many many exercise dvds, I know what is motivating and appealing.  This however is not one of those programmes.  He's a bit on the boring side and a little flighty.  I never understand why exercise dvds have a music soundtrack, if they aren't going to do repetitions to the beat.  The timing is hickilty pickilty, and if you aren't watching the screen but listening to him babble instead, then you will be way off the amount of reps that the model does.  That is frustrating.  And why does he want the viewers brain to be in their stomach???

DO NOT buy this dvd if you are intermediate or advanced.  It is purley for beginners.  It simply isn't challenging enough to be very beneficial to anyone over beginner level.

If you are looking for better workouts, then almost anything else will be superior to this.  Sorry David.",1114214400,15,926,4.539393939393939
8034370,5,B0002Y0HXO,David Kirsch is a great personal trainer.  I've even emailed him a question and he answered! I have all his videos and one book.  This video is a great arm and ab workout. The ab section will get you burning.  You must up the weights or do more reps on your own when you get the hang of it. He shows you how to do each move with proper form and is encouraging throughout. Definitely recommended!,1106524800,6,395,4.171052631578948
8034371,5,B0002Y0HXO,"If you can get through David's boot camp video with moderate effort, this video may be a bit too easy for you.  That said, this is an excellent workout for a beginning or intermmediate exerciser.  David does a great job of breaking the exercises down and offering comments to help you maintain good form.  He is very encouraging throughout.  The workout progresses from easy to more difficult and can be made tougher by increasing the amount of weight used (two dumbbells needed).  There are a few innovative moves thrown in as well.

Since the difficulty level of any workout video is relative, I'll give a quick background of myself - I run 4-5 times a week, for a total of 40+ miles/week.  I also lift weights 2-3 times a week, incorporating plyometrics and compound movements.  I've personally found David's boot camp video to be just the right amount of intensity when using 5-lb dumbbells and think this one-on-one video is great for days I have less energy.  Regardless of fitness level, you are sure to enjoy this workout.  If you need to make it more intense, use heavier weights.  The biggest thing to remember about David's style (in my opinion) is to really *focus* on every repetition, *focus* on the muscle being worked, and *focus* on isometrics (contracting the muscle without movement - eg. pushing against a brick wall is isometric).  Hope this helps!",1101513600,28,1369,4.803418803418803
8034372,3,B0002Y0HXO,"This workout is similar to other workouts I have done, yet it is different in the fact it breaks down each exercise into segments.  I like using it with the Butt video, and making my own workouts using the different segments.",1099353600,3,225,4.487804878048781
8034373,5,B0002Y0HXO,"I worked with David on Extreme Makeover and know that his training and scupting exercises work. David knows the extra ""tweeks"" that make any exercise more effective. Don't waste your time doing the wrong exercise, or doing it the wrong way. Trust David! It works!
