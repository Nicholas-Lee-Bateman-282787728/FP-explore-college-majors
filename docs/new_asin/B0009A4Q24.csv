8058690,5,B0009A4Q24,Cool video of monster trucks from Hawaii in 1989 & 1990. Also has some mud racing from California @ the end of it.,1358553600,,114,4.0
8058691,5,B0009A4Q24,"One of the great indie monster truck racing films to come out of the late eighties, early nineties period when the chrome and candy apple giants were just beginning to find themselves airborne! The monsters head to Hawaii's Aloha Stadium for the 1989 Super Truck Battle on an extremely difficult J-style drag course. We see exhibition monsters, monster racing, and even the ridiculously incredible Destroyer-One monster truck transformer. Skip ahead a year to the even more competitive 1990 Super Truck Battle at Aloha, where some of the nations' best do battle on the dustiest course you'll ever see! There's Super Pete, Predator, Rocky Mountain Thunder, and Lon Ranger, all doing battle over a tight J-style course. Meet Bigfoot Fastrax, and watch as he is hooked bumper to bumper with Taurus in an all out tug of war! No enough, then how about unlimited mud racing from sunny California to round it off. The soupy mud offers little resistance, but these monsters are battling the quagmire to see who can post the fastest time. All this on this one VHS cassette! This is an absolute must own for hardcore monster truck fans!",1352851200,,1126,4.900523560209424
