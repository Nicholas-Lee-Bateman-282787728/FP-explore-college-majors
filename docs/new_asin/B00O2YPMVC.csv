6708256,4,B00O2YPMVC,"Enjoyed series 1 and series two did not dissapoint, if you like UK Polce stories and the 60's this is a must",1419984000,4,108,3.9545454545454546
6708257,5,B00O2YPMVC,Excellent,1419120000,,9,9.0
6708258,3,B00O2YPMVC,"As fiction, it seems fine.  I have no idea how accurate it is historically.  I am a huge fan of ""Scott and Bailey"".  WPC 56 pales in comparison with the quality of story lines, how the ensemble cast works together.  The amount and what feels/seems to be authenticity of the stores.",1419033600,2,281,4.450980392156863
6708259,4,B00O2YPMVC,"A little hokey, but if you like BBC productions, and don't mind simple, you will love it.",1417305600,,89,4.294117647058823
6708260,3,B00O2YPMVC,"More was expected than delivered by this series about the first woman police constable trying hard to be taken seriously in the man's world of policing after WWII.  The period recreation is good but the engaging and pretty first WPC 56 is an unbelievably naive; thrusting herself headlong into ""trying to make a difference"" she narrowly avoids a career killing affair with a detective cursed with a rich, but mentally troubled wife in Series One.  Various themes such as a corrupt police sergeant are introduced but none seems to ring true as if the creators of the series were attempting to superimpose modern themes upon post WWII Britain such as a closed homosexual senior police officer and the Road to Damascus experience of the corrupt police sergeant when his true love, a prostitute, is killed by the local mob.  I can hardly believe that WPC 56 is still employed after her affair with a gangster when working undercover - good thing he is killed and the affair remains a secret.",1431907200,4,987,4.794117647058823
6708261,5,B00O2YPMVC,Great,1431561600,,5,5.0
6708262,3,B00O2YPMVC,Yay!  Series two.  It was interesting and I will go on watching it if they continue.,1430352000,,84,4.1875
6708263,4,B00O2YPMVC,"1st season was really good, I could not stop watching. Season 2 was fairly good.",1429056000,,80,4.4
6708264,5,B00O2YPMVC,Wonderful series - eagerly waiting for Series 3.  Highly accurate about attitude towards women in male-dominated jobs.,1426032000,,118,5.9411764705882355
6708265,5,B00O2YPMVC,"Excellent British police show that takes place in the '50s about the first woman police constable at her station.  Mostly done with a straight face but they do manage to slip,some levity into the script.",1425427200,,203,4.8
6708266,5,B00O2YPMVC,Great new series,1424476800,,16,4.666666666666667
6708267,5,B00O2YPMVC,"I bought series 1 on a whim--love all British TV shows and the era and cast made WPC 56 a particular delight--watched it and immediately ordered series 2 and tore through it in a couple of nights. Now I'm bereft, eager for series 3 because there's definitely story lines that are not finished yet. Wikipedia says series 3 will be broadcast in early 2015! I became quite fond of Sgt. Sidney Fenton and the new secretary, Susie Nightingale.",1422230400,13,438,4.628205128205129
6708268,5,B00O2YPMVC,Both seasons of this series had interesting murder mysteries but what really caught my interest was the attitiude toward women in this 1950's era. If I were teaching a course at university I would use these movies as part of course work encouraging discussions that are most relevant in today's climate.,1421193600,3,303,4.96078431372549
6708269,4,B00O2YPMVC,Great series. Can't wait for season 3. Hope they bring character of Jack Burns back!,1420156800,3,84,4.666666666666667
8681770,5,B00O2YPMVC,"I really enjoyed this series, think it was better than series one tho' WPC 56 at times seems irritatingly timid. I'm hoping there will be a series 3.",1518480000,,149,4.357142857142857
8681771,5,B00O2YPMVC,Excellent quality and great story.,1517529600,,34,6.0
8681772,5,B00O2YPMVC,"A time when women are not considered suitable for police work and what they had to go thru,,
they were more for getting tea and typing than actual brains to solve crimes,",1499904000,,170,4.34375
8681773,5,B00O2YPMVC,Made it easy to catch up,1483056000,,24,3.1666666666666665
8681774,5,B00O2YPMVC,"Great series, unfortunately canceled. Appeal is to Midwifes crowd but evidently BBC botched rollout, didn't publicize.",1444262400,,118,6.4375
8681775,5,B00O2YPMVC,One of the best British police period series,1442275200,,44,4.625
8681776,4,B00O2YPMVC,"Interesting show.  A little campy.  The title sequence makes you think they were doing things on a shoestring.  Bottom line, it's not Foyles War, but a well done series that keeps your attention and is fun to watch.",1440979200,,215,4.605263157894737
8681777,5,B00O2YPMVC,"She really was to be a police woman and she is handed  over some weird cases, I don't know because she is a new one on the job, but a lot of times because she is a woman.  It a strictly A man world, for the year that it is.  She get harassed physically by an older policeman but she does report it.  I really do recommend it and I will wait for the next one.",1438905600,,358,3.6710526315789473
8681778,5,B00O2YPMVC,Safe for kids to watch - hard to find today! None of the trash on today's TV - just good entertainment.,1438214400,,103,3.9523809523809526
8681779,5,B00O2YPMVC,Good British series about a woman entering the police force in the 50's.  Sure wouldn't go down this way now. Also much about their personal lives included in this series.,1435881600,,171,4.7
