2672783,5,B000JJSJN2,"Amazing lesson licks, killer quality sound and AMAZING live performance.  What a fun time this dvd is.  Redd in tiptop form too.

Much love to a guy that continues to do the music the right way and keeps it real! xoxo",1225843200,5,217,4.2439024390243905
2672784,5,B000JJSJN2,"Redd is a great guy and a fantastic player with an exellent band!
Need more stuff to learn from him!",1214524800,,100,4.05
2672785,4,B000JJSJN2,"I bought this for the concert footage.  It had been posted on YouTube at one time, but removed for copyright reasons.  Were it not for that, I'd never have even found out who Redd Volkaert is -- all the sudden, now, I like Country.

Anyways, the band is tight and the guitar work is excellent.  And Cindy Cashdollar on steel is a special treat.

I can't comment on the instructional material at this point ... i haven't even looked at it.  I wonder if it will come across on bass??",1188950400,,481,4.288888888888889
2672786,5,B000JJSJN2,"This would be worth buying for the live show alone, which is amazing, but he actually teaches you how to start doing this stuff. If you're a novice chicken picker like myself I would highly reccomend this dvd. The licks are filmed with great detail on left and most importantly, right hand technique.",1172534400,,300,4.679245283018868
2672797,5,B000JJSJN2,"Redd is a legend in country guitar from his studio work in LA and Nashville to his long run as Merle Haggard's telecaster master. If you are a Redd fan or a fan of classic country this is a fun video. The lesson is limited but the included performance at the famous Continental Club in Austin, TX, with Cindy Cashdollar on lap steel and one of Austin's hottest rhythm sections, is worth every penny. Redd sells this video at his live performances and refers to it as ""guitar porn,"" and any player with an appreciation for classic country and country swing will love it.",1363910400,2,569,4.480769230769231
2672798,5,B000JJSJN2,"What can I say Redd's tele crys, laughs, weeps and jumps for joy.  An unbelievable amount of tone and emotion out of one guitar.  He recommends that you listen to jazz, blues, country and rock and you can hear all four in almost every song he plays on the DVD.  There are some classic songs here, Redd and Cindy do an awesome job on Bob Wills - Twin Guitar Special; one of Redd's finest self-penned tunes Tube'n, is a case study in tele tone and has a dark lilting lap steel solo by Cindy that puts it over the top.  Many other great songs on here also, really showcasing two great guitar players that work incredibly well together and seem to having a good time doing it.  And there are some fun licks to learn also.",1336953600,2,717,4.242647058823529
2672799,3,B000JJSJN2,"I really enjoyed the live concert footage of Redd at the Continental Club, but was a little disappointed in the actual lessons. Redd's an awesome guitarist, but there are some things you just can't teach. The licks he demonstrates seemed pretty random and not very challenging.",1334793600,3,277,5.043478260869565
2672800,5,B000JJSJN2,"The DVD is split into two sectons. It starts with a tutorial showing various country style licks. The video has an interesting split camera technique with one camera above the fretboard showing what the left hand is doing, so you get the players eye view of what is going on. The licks are great, however there is no real explanation of any of the theory behind them. They are what they are, standalone licks which you can learn and incorporate into your playing.

The second part is a performance at the Continental Club in Austin, Tx. Interspersed with some Redd Anecdotes about his life as he drives around Austin. This is worth buying the DVD for alone. Here you get to see the full viruosity of Redd and the band and learn more about Redd's life.

This is not one for someone who wants to start learning country style guitar, there are better beginners DVD's e.g. check out lick library's Steve Trovato series. This is however a great insight into one of Country's finest Tele players, with a boot full of licks to learn and use in your playing.

Fascinating!",1329523200,,1064,4.589473684210526
2672801,4,B000JJSJN2,"I didn't even know who this guy was until he was mentioned in Brad Paisley's ""Cluster Pluck"" intro, but I figured I'd take the advice and learn something from him.

Well, the teaching part of the DVD is lacking. True, he shows us some licks but doesn't necessarily ""teach"" them to us.

However, there's more than an hour of interviews edited together with a great little concert that left my household full of new fans.

I'm off to start collecting Redd's cds now. Thanks Brad!",1300233600,3,477,4.588235294117647
2672802,5,B000JJSJN2,"For downright entertainment, ya just can't beat Redd (Merle Haggard's main picker)on the telecaster and Cindy Cashdollar (formerly with Asleep At The Wheel)as these folks can really make some sweet music. ..........and make it look EASY while having fun with each series of licks.  They are HOT !@",1288742400,,297,5.1875
2672803,5,B000JJSJN2,"I have follwed Redd's career over the years.  He is an amazing guitarist, and the instructional part of this video is valuable to anyone who wants to learn more about the instrument.  The performance part is highly entertaining also, Cindy Cashdollar is fantastic!!",1275350400,,265,5.1395348837209305
2672804,5,B000JJSJN2,"I came at this tape from a steel players angle. The steel and lap playing by Cindy Cashdollar is awesome! She is my very favorite steel player! I also play a Tele so this was a deciding factor also in the purchase.

The entire set at the Continental is some of the finest playing I have ever heard. Redd Volkaert is a fabulous Tele player, and great singer, very entertaining!

Along with the Telecaster instructional part of the DVD this is kind of like the ""Holy Grail"" for Telecaster nuts, and Steel players!

I have spent numerous hours watching this DVD, learning something new each time from Cindy, or Redd. Redd Volkaert and Cindy Cashdollar at the very top of their game!",1243296000,7,679,4.549180327868853
2672805,5,B000JJSJN2,"An interesting DVD with some bonus 'live' tracks and interview with Redd.
His teaching style is relaxed yet informative and a unique way of filming the neck makes you see on screen what you see with the guitar in your hand.
Redd makes it all seem so deceptively simple and fun that you can watch it just as entertainment.

Bravo Redd !!",1238716800,,336,4.419354838709677
2672806,5,B000JJSJN2,"This is a great dvd!!  If you like great guitar licks Red Volkart and his
Tele is fantastic!! And Cindy Cashdollar is fantastic on her Fender double
neck. Great picken from the both of them.
  thank you very much, Drew Ritzul",1235088000,4,225,4.439024390243903
8151096,5,B000JJSJN2,Redd is the man for country guitar.,1508803200,,35,4.142857142857143
8151097,5,B000JJSJN2,Anything with Redd playing on it is worth twice the price! :-)  Great lessons and a great performance at the Continental Club in Austin.,1484956800,,136,4.666666666666667
8151098,5,B000JJSJN2,Great guitar playing,1471996800,,20,6.0
8151099,3,B000JJSJN2,"Quick delivery, but i wasn't impressed with Red's teaching style. He seemed to get off-topic too easily. If you like his music -- get it, but don't expect to learn a lot from it.",1462147200,2,178,4.264705882352941
8151100,5,B000JJSJN2,Redd is easily one of the very best guitar pickers. In this video he shows a lot of useful stuff. I highly recommend it.,1457827200,,120,4.041666666666667
8151101,4,B000JJSJN2,"Some good stuff, not much, but still decent.",1456012800,,44,4.625
8151102,2,B000JJSJN2,"This is crap. Do yourself a favor and just practice, no insight into technique or of anything for that matter. Just some dudes philosophy of being a dude, and of coarse stealing licks, with utterly no explanation at all. But it's ok, he doesn't know wtf he's doing either.",1424736000,,272,4.571428571428571
8151103,5,B000JJSJN2,"Redd Volkaert- the MAN! The instructional aspects of this video are nice, but I bought it for the live performance featuring Redd and Cindy Cashdollar.",1418688000,,151,5.08
8151104,5,B000JJSJN2,I really appreciate Redd Volcart 's talent. DVD is excellent.!! Wonderful  tele player.,1406160000,,87,5.6923076923076925
8151105,5,B000JJSJN2,"Redd is one of the best guitarist you will ever hear. Very entertaining. Not just a guy who guitar freaks like. He literally can play
anything!!! The most impressive guitarist I have seen since Danny Gatton.
The 20 short lessons on this DVD are very good. Very helpful for the Intermeadiate to Advanced player.",1401840000,,310,4.7592592592592595
