1998805,3,B0001GH7A4,"An amusing, not so scary little film.  Barbara Steel is always good though so worth watching if you like her.  The quality is not good however. Grainy and a poor transfer.",1187740800,,171,4.483870967741935
1998806,4,B0001GH7A4,"Aside from the dubbing being off, Nightmare Castle is one of the best horror films from the 'Love Generation'(besides Rosemary's Baby or Night of the Living Dead, The Innocents), yet. It sticks right to the plot, where some horror movies of that genre definetly do not.
Scream queen Barbara Steele plays a double role in this one; as (raven haired) Muriel who gets murdered along with her lover by her jealous husband Steven (Paul Muller). Her (blonde haired) troubled sister, Jenny  is constantly plagued with visitations by her ghost. Jenny is also slowly being driven mad by Steven and the maid (Helga Line) and when given the chance, they slip a few mickeys in her drinks. Muriel and her lover eventualy re materializes and seeks revenge by killing Steve and the maid, while Jenny and her doctor (Lawrence Clift) flee the castle for good.  This double role richly showcases her etraordinary and in some cases brilliant talent.
This film definetly has all the makes of a classic victorian horror story, with a touch of sexuality of course.
Since this is the shorter version, I definetly recomend 'The Faceless Monster'. This full length version also can be found on this site. It is featured in the film compilation 'Euro Fiends From Beyond The Grave.' Enjoy!",1181174400,3,1262,4.892523364485982
1998807,3,B0001GH7A4,"""Nightmare Castle"" (Originally ""Amanti D'oltretomba,"" but a.k.a. ""Night of the Doomed,"" ""The Faceless Monsters,"" and ""Lovers From Beyond the Tomb"") begins with Dr. Arrowsmith (Paul Mller), discovering his wife, Muriel (Barbara Steele), in the arms of her lover, David (Rik Battaglia).  There is a lesson to be learned here regarding trying to make out in secret in a greenhouse, but it is too late for thse two because the doctor decides to torture and then electrocute them to death as part of his scientific experiments. Then he drains their blood from their corpses, throws their hearts into an urn, and injects the blood into Solange (Helga Line), his loyal but ancient servant. She was Arrowsmith's lover in the good old days and the blood transforms her back into a beautiful woman.

Then Arrowsmith finds out he has made one little mistake.  It seems that according to her will his wife's fortune goes not to him but to Jenny (Barbara Steele in a blonde wig this time).  Fortunately, Jenny is a bit off of her rocker, so Arrowsmith decides to marry her so that he can then drive her mad by giving her hallucinogenic drugs so he can finally get his hands on that inheritance.  However, Derek Joyce (Lawrence Clift), Jenny's doctor, stands in the way of the plan working. Then Jenny starts having strange dreams about murders in the greenhouse, Joyce discovers the two hearts in the urn, and Solange needs another blood transfusion.  How ever will it all end?

If this is your first Barbara Steele film it may well end up being your last. The story is a hodge-podge of more familiar and better told tales from that period. Steele already played both the good and the evil girl in her best known film, ""Black Sunday,"" you can name your haunted house movie where past crimes are remembered, and if you want to try and take the high road you can see some parallels with ""Rebecca."" Besides, the film is not only in unglorious black & white, it looks like it was shot on videotape and I kept thinking this is what ""Dark Shadows"" would have looked like if it had been on television in the 1950s. Director Mario Caiano does nothing here to impress you and once you get past the initial sadistic torturing of the lovers if you were expecting the film to take advantage of Steele's looks you would be sadly mistaken.",1134172800,,2312,4.665847665847666
1998808,5,B0001GH7A4,"Italian director Mario Caino's film ""Gli Amanti Del'otre tombe"" was dubbed in English and sold to American audiences in 1965 as ""Nightmare Castle"" starring Barbara Steele who had appeared in Federico Fellini's ""8 1/2"". Barbara Steele was for many years a celebrated ""scream queen"" of horror films. Her exotic beauty- dark hair, cat-like eyes and pale skin, made her a hot item in Italian cinema. In Nightmare Castle, Barbara Steele plays a beautiful but spoiled scientist's wife who dallies with the gardener. When her affair is discovered, her husband tortures the lovers through electrocution in his dungeon. The lovers die. Some time afterward, the scientist marries his dead wife's look-alike sister or half sister. She becomes a victim in the scientit's twisted world but the lovers from beyond the grave make it possible for her to win out in the end. The cinematography is black and white but chilling and Gothic in its ambiance- old castles, dungeons, ghosts, creepy noises. It's an enjoyable movie with really great piano/organ music as well even if it's repetitive. However, for an old 60's film some parts are awfully violent and scary so this is material to be viewed by adults and serious horror fanatics. And of course fans of horror legend Barbara Steele.",1130112000,13,1270,5.052380952380952

To watch this movie, you should be a B/W horror movie fan, or at least Barbara Steel fan. You should be comfortable with old days gloomy situation.

The story is about a landlord killed his unfaithful wife Muriel (Barbara Steel) and her lover. Instead of bury them, he burned them and preserved their heart. Jenny(also by Barbara Steel), his new wife, had a serial nightmare upon Muriel. When examined by a young doctor, all misteries start to uncovered, that put his life also in danger.

A sound scolding will not do, Arrowsmith chains them to a wall and tortures them.  A hot poker, a little acid, and then he cooks them on a bed by electrocuting them.  He relieves them of their hearts then drains his wife so he can give her blood to Solange, who goes from an old crone to a young beauty.  Unfortunately for the angry husband, rich Muriel fixed her Will so her slightly unhinged stepsister (Barbara Steele as Jenny) inherits everything.  Naturally, he marries the poor girl straight away, annoying Solange who thought she was going to get fringe benefits from her employer for services tended.  But have a little faith!

They call for her doctor, a good witness if any, to provide them with the means to have Jenny put away.  Regrettably, the doctor has other plans.  And so do the two ghosts.

While the print is better, it really for me is not worth a purchase which I made. Find it also strange that some consider this film a valentine to Barbara Steele. to be honest, her performance, especially when she is the blond sister is not all that great. far better in Black Sunday and Castle of Blood. Also the commentary between Steele and the person talking to her, is strange as they kind of realize the film is not all that it could have perhaps been.

While Castle of Blood is the also hear, I soul warn people there is some wear and tear on the print they show, though the advertising seem stop suggest that this is some rare print. In id 2006, there was a DVD out that was far better, and that film is a real masterpiece, and highly recommended, also uncut with some juicy European scenes that were cut from the American release.

1998826,1,B0001GH7A4,"NIGHTMARE CASTLE [1965 / 2015] [Blu-ray] One of Barbara Steele's Worst Horror Film!

At the height of her career as the dark goddess of Italian horror, the legendary Barbara Steele [BLACK SUNDAY] delivered two of her most memorable performances in this tale of obsession, madness and depravity.

NIGHTMARE CASTLE [The Night of the Doomed] [1965] Barbara Steele stars as a cheating wife who is chained, whipped and tortured to death by her sadistic scientist husband, and as her unstable blonde stepsister whose fate may be even more ghastly. Paul Muller [VAMPYROS LESBOS], Helga Lin&eacute; [HORROR EXPRESS] and Rik Battaglia [SISTER EMANUELLE] co-star in this twisted shocker directed by Mario Caiano, featuring stunning black-and-white cinematography by Enzo Barboni and the very first horror score by Ennio Morricone.

Castle of Blood [1964] Interviewing Edgar Allan Poe [Montgomery Glenn] in a shadowy London pub, journalist Alan Foster [Georges Rivi&egrave;re] questions the veracity of Poe's macabre tales. Poe bets Foster he can't spend the night of All Soul's Eve in the haunted mansion of Poe's friend Lord Blackwood [Raul H. Newman]. Every night in Blackwood Castle, the dead rise and re-live their grisly demise. With the help of a beautiful, sympathetic spectre [Barbara Steele], Foster hopes to escape the shadowy castle alive.

Terror-Creatures From The Grave [1965] An attorney arrives at a castle to settle the estate of its recently deceased owner. The owner's widow and daughter claim that the late lord could summon the souls of ancient plague victims, and that his spirit roams the castle. Soon occupants of the castle begin to die in gruesome, violent ways.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Well what can I say about the 2015 Blu-ray Release of the Severin Films NIGHTMARE CASTLE [The Night of the Doomed] [1965]; Castle of Blood [1964] and Terror-Creatures From The Grave [1965] is the biggest load of rubbish that has ever graced my Blu-ray Collection, because one Castle of Blood [1964] has the most atrocious video and audio quality, so I do not know how they can have the nerve to put it on the Blu-ray disc. Terror-Creatures From The Grave [1965] is 50% of good quality video presentation, but at one point the video and audio have the worst anomalies I have ever seen and so all in all it is a very unprofessional presentation and I am glad to get rid of this atrocious Blu-ray release.

NIGHTMARE CASTLE Blu-ray Video Quality  Severin Films NIGHTMARE CASTLE [The Night of the Doomed] has a brand new 1080p encoded image restoration transfer from a USA rare print and is totally outstanding. Severin Film does not try to improve the films texture, but instead you get a brilliant crisp black-and-white image with the natural grain is left intact and is very fine and is not at all distracting. There are also no signs of excessive DNR [Digital Noise Reduction] filtering or edge enhancement. Close-ups, full and long shots have phenomenal detail without looking too enhanced. Occasionally, one sees a few white speckles now and again and other small elements of print damage, but this is inconsequential and not detrimental to your viewing enjoyment. Some scenes show some black blemishes, but this looks like to have been inherited from the films original print negative, but rather than being a side effect of this new upgraded restoration. Its safe to say that all genre horror fans have never seen NIGHTMARE CASTLE look this good on this Blu-ray disc release, compared to previous home video format, especially the inferior DVD release.

NIGHTMARE CASTLE Blu-ray Audio Quality  Severin Films new English 2.0 LPCM Stereo Audio language track has an overall presence which is totally free of hiss, pops, and or other age-related anomalies. Composer Ennio Morricones haunting organ music comes over with fine clarity and with just enough body for comfort. The dialogue is clear and easy to follow. Personally, I did not like the English dubbing, as it is like watching a Federico Fellini film with his style of dubbing, even though its good to hear Barbara Steeles real voice and she does a splendid job with the dubbing and I suspect the Italian track would have sounded more authentic, but unfortunately it is not available with this Blu-ray disc release.

Castle of Blood Blu-ray Video Quality  They tell us that the print is sourced from a brand New HD Transfer of a Rare USA print, well I wish they hadnt bothered, as it has the most atrocious quality I have ever seen. It has massive amounts of white speckles that make this print totally unwatchable. But it is such a shame as this was a really good macabre storyline, especially the ending.

Castle of Blood Blu-ray Audio Quality  Like the video print, the audio quality is the biggest load of rubbish and I felt it was totally unwatchable. But again it is a shame as this again was a really good macabre storyline, especially the ending. Also I did not like the dubbing.

Terror-Creatures From The Grave Blu-ray Video Quality  Again on the Blu-ray Case it boasts that the print is sourced from a brand New HD Transfer of a Rare USA print, well 50% is of good quality, but around the 35 minute mark, you get some really horrendous anomalies that is really off putting, which put me off watching this film all together and only watch half of it, as it was such unprofessional presentation.

Terror-Creatures From The Grave Blu-ray Audio Quality  Like the video print, the audio quality is again off putting at the 35 minute mark like I have already informed you. But the at the 45 minute mark again you get some more horrible anomalies of horrendous sound that really puts you off watching the film and gave up at that point. I also hated the terrible dubbing that is prevalent with Italian Horror Film and it looks so horrendous, as not seeing the lips and sound matching up is so off putting and again it is not in my opinion is a very unprofessional presentation.

Finally, anyone who is a massive big fan of Italian horror cinema genre of this Severin Films release. NIGHTMARE CASTLE [1965] [The Night Of The Doomed] is so deliciously over-the-top Italian melodrama with elements of the atmospheric Le Th&eacute;tre du Grand Guignol, that used to put on naturalistic horror shows between 1897 until its closing in 1962 in Paris. NIGHTMARE CASTLE boasts an atmospheric early score by the great and brilliant composer Ennio Morricone, not to mention the mesmerising presence of the equally great Barbara Steele actress. To top it off, we are given huge amounts of extra features, that I have not even bothered to view, as the two other films are the biggest atrocious let down of most unprofessional quality. I personally think Severin Films Blu-ray release apart from the film NIGHTMARE CASTLE [The Night Of The Domed] which is of an exceptional quality, the other two films like Castle of Blood is a really atrocious video and audio quality and Terror-Creatures From The Grave is only 50% of good quality, but the audio sound was atrocious and I have given my Blu-ray copy away, as it is a total disgrace to have in my Blu-ray Collection and Severin Films should be totally ashamed of releasing this bad quality Blu-ray disc and so gets a big thumbs down recommendation and I think you will be wasting your money.

1998833,5,B0001GH7A4,"I have been a Barbara Steele fan for many years. I first came to know ""of her"" in the movie ""The Pit and the Pendulum"" with another all time favorite of mine, Vincent Price. This particular Blu-ray for her movie ""Nightmare Castle"" is exceptional beyond words. I truly mean that. I have never seen this movie look this good.
If only all her movies looked this good! Not only do we get this movie, but we get two more of her movies (the US versions-HD transferred, but not restored), ""Castle of Blood"", and ""Terror Creatures From the Grave"". Both of those are at least in HD format here and it seems no restoration for those was done before putting them on Blu-ray. So, with that said, you are getting a US print that was used to make the Blu-ray. I have the Uncut European version of ""Castle of Blood"" on DVD, (the Red cover), which is clean as far as white lines, specks, film dirt, etc., but it is not as sharp as HD in detail.
I would recommend getting that DVD as well for a cleaner film print and a few uncut scenes, most notably the couple who arrive later in the movie. The wife is upstairs and gets undressed and shows off her bosom. This is cut out of the US version and Barbara Steele and the actress that plays ""Julia"" have a little love fest before Barbara (Elisabeth) plunges a knife into Julia's mid section. Those two scenes are the only difference that I have noticed.
Also, the ""uncut"" DVD has lost English dub audio problem in a few scenes that you have to have English subtitles on in order to know what is being said.
As far as the other Special Features are concerned on this Blu-ray, superb! I highly recommend this Blu-ray for the mere fact it has a 2009 interview with Barbara Steele talking about her very beginnings, showing clips of her modeling days, movie roles, etc. It lasts for about half an hour. Wow, what a doll she is and she doesn't hold back on what she thinks of her career, either.
The movie ""Nightmare Castle"" I would say is not the best in her career. I thought is had a decent storyline, though the pace could have been better.
Her and her lover's ghost don't actually show up until toward the end of the movie when the doctor removes the knife from their hearts that have been in a water submerged tank. It is only then that they take revenge on the abusive husband and the woman (Helga Line') that helped him.
The middle of the film shows her sister ""Jenny"" (Barbara with a blonde wig) come to the castle having married the same fool that killed her sister.
For me as a Barbara Steele fan for many years, this is a most for my ever increasing Blu-ray library. Thank you Severin films!",1444867200,5,2628,4.3543788187372705

1998835,4,B0001GH7A4,"I was glad to receive this triple pack set as it contains 3  Barbara Steele movies from the 1960s, all of which have been hard to find in good watchable condition.

The headliner is the gothic melodrama Nightmare Castle, which sees Steele in a dual role, first as an unfaithful wife who meets a grisly comeuppance from her sadistic husband (who seems to go beyond simple hurt feelings with his revenge!). Steele then appears again as the dead wifes insane sister, whom the husband hastily springs from an asylum and marries, as she seems to be the heir to the first sisters fortune. The main plot of the film now kicks in, and depicts what happens to this highly strung woman as supernatural events assault her in her new home.

Nightmare Castle does look good, and this Blurray version is stunningly restored. The photography is excellent, although several shots are out of focus, which disappointed me. The lighting and camera work make the most of the cast and sets, mostly Steele of course, although she does look rather odd in a badly fitting blonde wig. The period costumes are also a bit suspect, with the ugliest bustles that I have ever seen, hanging halfway down to the knees. They look ridiculousSadly the story is not great, especially the subplot involving the housekeeper who goes from wizened crone to gorgeous beauty (well, it is Helga Line) with no explanation - and when the explanation does come its impossible to fill in the earlier plot holes that made it so confusing in the first place. The dubbing spoils a lot of the atmosphere, especially Steeles acting, which takes a hit from the very poor lip synching - didn't she speak her own lines in English? It doesnt look like it. Anyway at least its entertaining enough.

The second movie is ""Castle of Blood, which appears to be largely identical to Nightmare Castle"" in its conception. Again we have an ominous castle, a gothic period setting, supernatural occurrences, death and murder, and lovely ladies. Steele again is the focus of the visuals, although in this film I though she was outclassed by the statuesque Margrete Robsahm as Julia, who looks simply stunning in the many lingering portrait shots of her that the film employs. Again, the remastered print is pin-sharp, and its all shot in focus, which says to me that at least somebody in the original production did some quality control, unlike in Nightmare Castle - although its covered in scratches and damage, particularly near the beginning. Its also apparently not the full version, as that contains topless shots and lesbian overtones, none of which are present here! This didn't bother me much as the film did play well enough as it stands in this version.

The third movie in the set is the appallingly titled Terror Creatures From The Grave. But it is pretty good, although yet again we have a gothic period setting, an isolated mansion, and Barbara Steele doing her usual mysterious thing with the long hair and heaps of dark eye make-up. This story involves a doctor arriving at a country house and finding two sisters living there, terrified of various supernatural occurrences that are assaulting them. This movie does have a more picturesque set than the other two, with a really imposing mansion (you can barely make out the building's exterior appearance in the other two movies) and some great outdoor scenes shot in beautiful countryside. It also has some very modern ideas, and some scenes are very reminiscent of Lucio Fulcis House by the Cemetery (made two decades later!), such as when the doctor listens to a recording of a previous investigator narrating some gruesome happenings, and some POV camera shots that prowl through the house after the heroine. But of the three, this one probably has the worst dubbing. Its impossible to empathise with the the actors when the vocal performances are so badly matched. The print is sharp again, but there is damage, especially about 35 minutes in when it all but falls apart on the screen! However, its definitely watchable, in fact it could have easily been the main feature. its also got the goriest special effects of all three movies.

The Bluray is rounded off with some extras including trailers, mini interviews, a conversation with Barbara Steele (she is wonderfully bonkers), and some trailers and some extensive outtakes from Terror Creatures including whole different scenes - this was very interesting. All in all a very good set, and all three films are great hi-def copies and while they don't quite live up to the legendary status they seem to have aqcuired, they are all easily as good as each other",1444521600,4,4615,4.850253807106599
1998836,5,B0001GH7A4,"Never have I seen this as clear and uncut as this version. Great interview with the ""Queen of Scream"" herself filled with little tidbits about Barbara and her career in film.",1444348800,2,174,4.645161290322581
1998837,3,B0001GH7A4,"This was a bit disappointing. I thought that with this Barbara Steele gothic film, I would have a good trilogy: BLACK SUNDAY, CASTLE OF BLOOD (DANSE MACABRE), and NIGHTMARE CASTLE. Unfortunately, this film lacks suspense, pacing, and much in the way of a plot. By the time the real ghosts show up at the end, we are beyond caring. We are tired of seeing Barbara Steele in a blonde wig barely speaking her lines. Why did they not just hang a sign around her neck saying, ""Sweet, Innocent Character""?

This double role for Barbara lacks the impact of her good/evil roles in the classic BLACK SUNDAY -- but, then again, that film single-handedly restored to the screen what a real gothic horror film should look like. How many of that calibre have you seen since then?  NIGHTMARE CASTLE, in my view, does not come close. Then again, if you are curious, don't just take my view only; read other reviewers here and balance what their opinions against what I write. Then let us read your review. See if you agree that the ghosts show up too late, are not frightening, and are too easily dispensed with.",1444176000,3,1096,4.586734693877551

1998841,5,B0001GH7A4,"When this was first announced I was totally geeked. Why? Castle Of Blood is one of my favorite films of all time and it is on this blu ray. The blu ray not only has NIGHTMARE CASTLE on it but COB and TERROR CREATURES FROM THE GRAVE and even more extras!! This release does not disappoint and gets my vote for release of the year (so far). Nightmare Castle is drop dead stunning to look at with amazing depth and detail. This looks even better than the dvd release of a few years ago.

TCFTG is also a big step up from the lousy public domain versions that we've been beset with over the years. While it isn't cleaned up or ""restored"" it is a nice hi def presentation. Granted there are a lot of weak areas picture quality wise but it blows previous releases away.

CASTLE OF BLOOD also gets the hi def treatment. Granted the print is rather worn and there are a lot of lines, scratches, specks and other unpleasant flaws. However this is the US version which really hasn't had any kind of release before .(Synapse does have a dvd out of the Euro cut which has nudity and scenes edited out of the US print. Maybe someday they will do a hi def release). In spite of the flaws this viewer had a wonderful time with the film.

If you just consider the other two films as great extras you will be getting your money's worth. Three fun movies for a cold autumnal night!",1441756800,5,1363,4.254826254826255

It is a fine-grain 35mm print struck from the original camera neg, with Italian titles and about 14 minutes of footage the others don't have.  What a difference this makes!  The velvety razor sharp image, sweet clean sound and detail of the ancient castle is amazing.

1998865,5,B0001GH7A4,"I watched Nightmare Castle again recently after a long time, and found it to be as engaging as ever. The movie has alternate titles, i.e. Night of the Doomed, Lovers Beyond the Grave, and The Faceless Monster. Ennio Morricone's score sets the tone for this Gothic story of supernatural revenge. Dr. Stephen Arrowsmith (Paul Muller) is a sadistic scientist whose cruel nature and ghastly experiments alienate his wife, Muriel (Barbara Steele). One night, Muriel sneaks off with her lover, thinking her husband to be away only to be found and tortured to death by Arrowsmith. Before dying, Muriel vows to return from the dead to exact vengeance. When Arrowsmith finds out his wife's vast fortune has been bequeathed to her mentally incompetent, institutionalized step-sister, Jenny (a blonde Barbara Steele), he hatches a devious plan - he marries the hapless woman and brings her back to his home and the nightmare begins.

Soon after her arrival, Jenny experiences nightmares and strange visions and it becomes apparent that she is being haunted by the restless spirits of the murdered lovers. Jenny is then used as a tool to exact vengeance upon Arrowsmith. The cynical Arrowsmith refuses to believe that the strange events have anything to do with the supernatural while his co-conspirator/mistress, Solange (Helga Line), who also lives at the castle becomes a bundle of nerves. Observant viewers will notice the miraculous transformation of  Arrowsmith's mistress from a disfigured woman at the beginning of the story to a lovely, youthful-looking woman when Arrowsmith brings Jenny home. Without revealing too much, this factors into the story and has to do with Arrowsmith's scientific pursuits, and ties into the plot.

The atmosphere is thick with suspense and supernatural horror and this can best be described as a good old-fashioned, B&W ghost story. I'd definitely recommend this to fans of classic horror, especially if you're fond of Barbara Steele.",1369008000,,1962,5.24203821656051

1998868,2,B0001GH7A4,"Nightmare Castle (Mario Caiano, 1965)

It's taken me a lot of years and a lot of needless frustration, but I think I finally figured out what it is about Barbara Steele movies I just can't wrap my head around: Barbara Steele. Which may sound obvious. Okay, actually, it probably is. But I was reading reviews of this movie while watching it (because I was that bored), and there's only one thing about it everyone focused their praise on: Barbara Steele. And I turned back to the screen and watched this supposed beauty queen (whom I can't find at all attractive) running through yet another wooden, almost robot-like performance, and that's when it occurred to me: the woman simply can't act, and thus, if she doesn't strike your particular perceptions of beauty, what else IS there? Answer: nothing. And so what we have here is a low-budget haunted-castle shindig among a raft of low-budget haunted-castle shindigs that were coming out in Europe in the late sixties (most of which America has no clue about; it was, for example, a very popular subgenre in Yugosalvia, but distribution outside the country was so awful for Serbian-language haunted-castle films that I've only been able to track down two so far) whose sole attraction, at least judging by the reviews, was its leading lady. For some reason (he said sarcastically), I'm put in mind of the recent Michael Bay miss The Island.

Need you a plot? Well, the haunted-castle thing has become more obscure in the past half-century, and there hasn't been a major Roger Corman rediscovery in America yet, so I'll assume yes. A jealous, wealthy lord-type, Stephen Arrowsmith (Eugenie de Sade's Paul Muller, suspects his wife Muriel (Steele) of cavorting with the hired help (The Night Porter's Giuseppe Addobbati), which of course she is. He feigns leaving for business, then sneaks back in, discovers them, and makes them die in rather hideous fashions. Afterwards, he discovers that Muriel, who actually owns all the family wealth, had had her will changed (suspecting Stephen of skullduggery, no doubt) and left to her twin sister, Jenny, who's been ""taking the rest cure"", as they say, since about the dawn of history. Stephen, who's been having a dalliance of his own with the maid, Solange (Horror Express' Helga Line), hatches a cunning plan: go off, get Jenny, bring her back to the castle, convince her it's haunted, drive her mad enough to be committed (rather than just taking the etc.), get her declared incompetent, get the cash. All well and good, save two small hitches: in order to pull it off, Stephen has to actually marry Jenny, a development of which Solange is not altogether fond; and the castle actually is haunted, by the ghosts of the recently deceased, who implore Jenny to discover their crimes and report them to Dr. Joyce (Laurence Clift), Jenny's personal physician (read: psychiatrist), who has come along to keep an eye on his former charge. There's also a bunch of nonsense about Stephen, mad doctor that he is, having come up with a formula to keep Solange forever youthful, because chicks who look twenty are always willing to play around with the sixty-ish-looking lord of the manor, aren't they? (For the record, Muller was actually forty-two when the film was released; Line, 33.)

If you really want to stretch for a reason to check this out, it's (kind of) worth noting that the film was scored by Ennio Morricone, whose film music has become iconic over the years, though I don't remember anything in here really jumping out at me. Other than that, you've got a predictable, low-budget horror movie with bad acting (Addobbati, the smallest part among the principals, is the only decent actor in the bunch) in a subgenre so saturated you can find a half-dozen better contemporary movies covering the same material with a quick trip to Netflix. Why bother with this one? * 1/2",1307664000,2,3870,4.8873668188736685
1998869,4,B0001GH7A4,"Just some thoughts on this Barbara Steele movie...

Some spoilers ahead.

Nightmare Castle (1965) is an Italian horror film that has nearly everything you'd want in a horror movie suitable for watching on a dark and stormy night.  It's atmosphere is dark and macabre and the organ music by Ennio Morricone that plays throughout is eerie and unsettling.  It was filmed in black and white.  The stunning Barbara Steele once again plays dual roles, just as she did in Black Sunday (1960).  The plot is quite bizarre.  Basically a sadistic count kills his cheating wife and her man.  The count marries his wife's sister after he discovers that his wife's will gave her fortune to her sister.  The sister is in an institution.  After the count marries the sister, she begins having nightmares.  That's all I want to say.  Watch to find out how everything unfolds.

In my opinion, this movie isn't quite as good as Black Sunday, but it's no slouch, either.  I recommend it for fans of Barbara Steele and fans of black and white horror movies of yesteryear.",1301702400,3,1050,4.7292817679558015
1998870,4,B0001GH7A4,"This is the USA version of the black-and-white 1965 release of the Italian film that originally ran (in Italy) for 104 minutes. Unfortunately some imprudent editing has clearly diminished several of the finer points of the film, shaving off a star for me.

It's essentialy a terrific classic horror film, very gothic, and a bit of a psycho-thriller to boot. One big plus is the superb filmscore by none other than Ennio Morricone, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Good-the-Bad-and-the-Ugly/dp/6304698798/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</a>.)

The story: An evil and depraved Count with a large estate, (who also happens to practice a sort of Frankenstein-ish medicine), catches his cheating wife [Barbara Steele] with her lover. He tortures and kills them, draining his wife's blood (more on this later) but he's nettled to discover that his wife has written him out of her will (she was very rich), having awarded all her riches to her step-sister who is locked away in a mental asylum.

The hag of an aged housekeeper had been helping the Count to do his wife in because he had promised her a cut of the inheritance when his wife met her demise. *But* he also had a means, by using his wife's blood, of making this decrepit witch young and beautiful and he does so [This point is not all that well-made in this version of the film].

Then the Count elects to bring the step-sister [also Barbara Steele but now with a blonde wig] home, as she has somewhat recovered her sanity, and he plans to gain control of the estate through her. Much to the displeasure of the housekeeper (now young and beautiful) the Count unexpectedly marries the attractive step-sister during the carriage trip home. [For reasons unexplained, the step-sister looks exactly like the first wife, blonde hair aside, which should not be since they were not blood relatives... oh well -- it was probably ""half-sister"" before the translation went awry.] The Count pacifies the housekeeper as the plan is cemented between the two of them to drive the new wife crazy again, making it easy for him to access her inheritance.

The final Macguffin occurs when the Count invites his new wife's asylum doctor to his estate to care for his unstable wife. That drives up the suspense a notch or two since this unwitting physician is now in jeopardy too.

I like this film a lot but there certainly are some abrupt transitions. I've also seen some very marginal copies on multi-film DVD collections so beware of those. You get what you pay for, at least when you're lucky you do.

In summary, I can definitely recommend this creepy drive-in film for fans of the genre. The setting is first-class and the terrific filmscore is just icing on the cake.",1298160000,4,2777,4.959139784946236

Not now.  Here we have a disturbing fairy tale of betrayal and revenge from the grave from director Mario Caiano who, with Enzo Barboni, his director of photography, make a hauntingly beautiful hommage to the essence of Barbara Steele.  Although always remembered for her performance as Katia/Asa in Bavas 'BLACK SUNDAY', here we have an experienced, mature portrayal giving Steele her greatest horror role to date.  Fans of Jess Franco will recognize actor Paul Muller in an extremely, slimy performance and Helga Line, who almost blows away Steele in the Hot babe department, as Muller's mistress.  The film is presented in sharp, widescreen transfer with a crystal,clear soundtrack which really enhances the haunting music score by, surprise, Ennio Morricone.

Luckily, Severin Films managed to get hold of the original negative and create what is surely the ultimate edition of NIGHTMARE CASTLE.  The film itself drags in places and the plot about a scientist who has a cure for aging long before Botox, Retin-A and plastic surgery is kind of silly at times but it's worth it for the great creepy climax.  The cinematography is something I really failed to appreciate fully until seeing this incredible transfer.  The transfer is great and evidently, they cut quite a bit out of this in order to fit into late-night television time slots.  Thankfully, it is fully restored and has great extras like interviews with the director and Barbara Steele.  Also, this has the first horror score from Ennio Morricone and it really enhances the mood.  As I said before, I never appreciated the lighting too much on the old transfer but this is one beautifully shot movie.  The make-up and special effects are excellent too.

I bought this new re-mastered version hoping for the best and I was not disappointed. The print is extremely clean and looks fantastic with a few very minor glitches. This version runs one hour and 40 plus minutes! Which is considerably longer than any print I've ever seen.

The film is dripping with wonderful gothic atmosphere and filmed in glorious black and white. It's a great movie if your a fan of these creepy old horror film and this version also includes some interesting extras. A thirty minute interview with Barbara Steele, a 14 minute interview with the director and a couple of U.K. trailers for the film.

This film has never looked better and if you're a fan this is a must buy!",1244419200,22,985,4.371584699453552

The movie's never looked this good before; with the exception of two or three brief seconds, the image is immaculate.  No Italian subtitles, but respectable English dubbing.  And -- the disc's crowning glory -- a wonderful video interview with Steele, done for this release, where she talks in some detail about the beginnings of her career. Steele fled Hollywood, Fox, a blonde dye-job, Don Siegel, and Elvis Presley for Rome, where she fell in love with the Italian culture and the Italian film industry, making that series of horror flicks that elevated her to cult status.  Full of intelligent observations about her directors and co-stars (including some information about her role that Fellini cut from CASANOVA), here's a half-hour that shows a Steele you don't know, but will love.  If you think you'll like this release, trust me -- you will!  Highly recommended for horror fans.",1242864000,34,1054,5.028735632183908
1998879,4,B0001GH7A4,"Nightmare Castle has finally to DVD in a pristine print from Severin films. It had been reported all over the web about how Severin Films uncovered a negative and are remastering the print in HiDef which will blow away all other releases. Having watched this , you will indeed get a super clean transfer, widescreen and uncut. Time to get rid of the grainy or cut transfers.
This movie is an ultra Gothic movie, with tons of atmosphere & some shocking gore scenes. The musical score is phenominal. You get Barbara Steele(Muriel Arrowsmith) in a dual role. She gets killed by her sicko husband Paul Muller (Dr. Stephen Arrowsmith) when she gets caught having an affair. He remarries a reletive of Barbara Steele(who is blond), Jenny Arrowsmith who inherited her sister's fortune. Now he wants to kill her & inherit it from her.
The murdered couple come back to haunt Dr Arrowsmith & Jenny until they get total vengeance. They get inside Jenny's head to where she thinks she is Muriel.
That is basically the movie in a nutshell, but what makes this above average is the heavy Gothic atmosphere. If you are in the mood to watch, you will very much enjoy the film. On top of that the transfer of Severin films is just fantastic, with a couple of minor glitches here and there, but overall the transfer is very sharp with blacks looking very solid as opposed to a faded worn looking transfer. Severin films is to be commended for this effort. Very much recommended !",1236729600,61,1461,4.644787644787645
1998880,5,B0001GH7A4,"This is a review for the St-Clair Vision version. Several other versions are available, many with more attractive packaging. However, this version is very watchable, some jump-cuts and splices, a little hard to hear now and then, but for your money this is a pretty good buy for what you get. The visual image is mostly decent and does not hinder the film's impact. I enjoyed watching it and would recommend viewing this film as a double bill with Steele's CASTLE OF BLOOD (1964), or better yet with THE BLANCHVILLE MONSTER (1963) in which co-star Helga Line plays literally the same character.",1208044800,,594,4.833333333333333
8012351,3,B0001GH7A4,"Another oldie with Barbara Steele, whom I usually like, but this one is a bit too boring. The ending to this is pretty good, it just seems like it took too long to get there. Normally I like and recommend a lot of these classic horrors, but this would not be one of them. While not terrible, it's just not very interesting or entertaining either.

8012356,5,B0001GH7A4,"fun Victorian/Gothic horror tale, an absurd premise but it's enjoyable to experience. Shot in sharp, crisp black and white the visuals are a joy to behold and Barbara Steele shines in her own unique beauty as she plays a dual role. This movie is part ghost revenge story, part mad scientist sadist. Some reviewers have claimed a pristine HD transfer/copy but unfortunately there are areas of severe damage on quite a lot of frames which is sad... but it's still a great watch. I do find it odd that there isn't a truly pristine undamaged master copy of such a relatively modern film out there somewhere? The film looks excellent aside from those afore mentioned damaged frames and sequences that pop up occasionally.",1493078400,4,716,4.829268292682927

But this video copy is so dark that you cannot see what is going on half the time, it's almost as if it was filmed in the dark. The lighting when they are outside the castle is fine. You might be better off getting a DVD/Blu-ray, so you can see what is going on.",1480291200,,330,3.7971014492753623
