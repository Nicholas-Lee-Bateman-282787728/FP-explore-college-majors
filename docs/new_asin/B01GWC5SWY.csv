""The cooperation of the US Navy, Army, Coast Guard and Office of Strategic Services made this production possible."" The movie begins in Manila Bay 1941. Patrol Torpedo boats show their maneuverability to the Admiral. Officers relax in a bar. Rusty wants to return to a destroyer. One officer is retiring after 30 years. A soldier brings news to the top officers. All Army and Navy personnel must report to their posts on this Sunday. There is an alarm for Cavite, the Navy base. Boats are sent into the Bay for protections. They fire at the attacking enemy airplanes. There is damage to the base. An enemy invasion force is approaching. The Navy will move to Bataan. Their job is to do as much damage to the enemy as possible. Can they sink the Jap cruiser shelling Bataan? The shore batteries attack and hit one boat. The second boat fires it torpedoes and hits the target, a converted cruiser.

The sailors return to base. Rusty recovers in the hospital from a wound. ""Blood poisoning"" was a serious disease before modern antibiotics. [The film moves slowly here, padding to fill up time.] The top general and key personnel will be evacuated to Mindanao and then flown to Australia. They visit a man in sick bay, he has letters to post. The key personnel arrive with the top general for transport to Mindanao. Do they have aviation gasoline and torpedoes? One boat is damaged by the coral and its engines must be repaired. They hear about the approaching Japanese cruiser and destroyers that can attack the supply ships. Can the torpedo boats stop them? They try, and succeed. Enemy seaplanes attack them. One boat is disabled, then hit by a bomb. The survivors hear of the fall of Bataan from a San Francisco radio station. A remaining PT boat is turned over to the Army. [The story moves slowly here.]

The remaining sailors see the retreating soldiers. Brickley and Ryan will be returned to America so their experiences can be used for new PT boats. The transport airplane is loaded with thirty men. Their job is to get ready to back to the islands. The others will take their chances. And so the story ends. [The viewers of this 1945 movie know what happened afterwards.] This movie was produced when the war was about over. It does not have the action and drama found in earlier movies, or others from this era. It runs on too long. There were better films made during this time, and afterwards. Modern technology has done away with torpedo boats for most countries. Small countries may still use this low-cost method of defense at sea. Fighter-bombers and rockets are now the weapons of choice to attack or defend naval ships.",1488672000,,2667,4.706638115631692
