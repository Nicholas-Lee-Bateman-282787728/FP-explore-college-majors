7795830,4,0935621296,"I'm practicing Mantak Chia's healing tao for about a year, I'm doing the microcosmic orbit, chi kung I,II,III and before that fusion I (which is a must, don't try to start with this one before you've learnt the previous one).
Because this is not a moving technique, I think a book would be better.
Anyway the video is good, Mantak Chia's English is a bit hard at start (subtitles would be great), but after a few minutes you can learn to understand thai English. (that's why the 4 stars)
About the technique itself, opening of the thrusting chanells is something unlike any of the other methods, it feels like a streams of energy are flowing thru the body, and the organs. (unlike the microcosmic which flows on the rim of the body)
So if you like fusion I and the microcosmic, get this video and brace yourself to the ride of your chi.
