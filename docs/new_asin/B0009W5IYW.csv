2326361,5,B0009W5IYW,"The Backyardigans has proven to be more education than most cartoons I have seen lately.  My 16 month old son loves the music and the characters are very creative.  The different genres of music for each episode makes me very happy to know that my son is learning about a varity of wonderful music like country and mambo!  The DVD is good but you must get all the episodes if you can.  Most of them are great for adults and children, my husband and I groove to the music along with my son!",1126137600,9,489,4.225806451612903

2326392,5,B0009W5IYW,"This is a wonderful childrens series that takes place in the backyard and the imaginations of the main characters.

All the stories teach children something useful, whether it's manners or helping each other. My grandchildren love them and ask to watch them.",1355702400,,380,4.861538461538461

2326398,5,B0009W5IYW,"As far as I'm concerned, The Backyardigans is one of the few shows for kids that really can be enjoyed by both children and their parents. The characters are cute and have their own personalities, nearly every single song is memorable, the music rocks, and the theme for each episode is always fun. I won't deny watching episodes until they're over, even if my daughter goes off and does something else if she loses interest. Heck, if I found a shirt with Tyrone on it, I'd go for it. This dvd has 4 episodes, like most of them do, and there's a good variety here. 2 of them are listed as 'bonus episodes', but why bother listing them as that when they're the same length as the 2 'main' ones, and no one would've probably bought this if it was just 2 episodes?

First up is the title one, It's Great To Be a Ghost. Pablo, Tyrone and Uniqua pretend to be ghosts in a spooky mansion when Tasha, the unsuspecting stranger, comes in uninvited. It's all in good fun, and they're not trying to hurt her or anything. The music for this episode is early jazz (1920s), and you can't help but snap your fingers along when Pablo sings his song.

Monster Detectives has detective Tyrone help Uniqua find her soccer ball after it ends up at a castle where Pablo the Soccer Monster lives. The intro for this episode is really cute, and the gang even acknowledges humans in a rare instance, mentioning soccer legend Pel. This episode's music is early rock (1950s) and they did a great job making it sound like the original jukebox hits. Someone's gotta edit a music video using the Soccer Monster song and footage of Happy Days.

The Key to the Nile is one of my favorites, and an episode that has Tasha as the leader for a change. She's an Egyptian queen (CleoTasha) and has her servants help her find three treasures to give to the Sphinx, who's played by Uniqua. This episode teaches the importance of saying 'please' and 'thank you', and being appreciative to others who help you. For the music, you get more of a Broadway style, if that makes any sense. 'hard to explain really, but the songs are all memorable, especially 'I Want My River Back'.

Finally is Pirate Treasure, which features reggae and ska for the soundtrack. Uniqua and Pablo are pirates looking for treasure using half of a treasure map, but pirates Tyrone and Austin are doing the same and happen to have the other half of the map as well. The Backyardigans sing a different version of the classing song 'Drunken Sailor' but calling it 'Scurvy Pirate' here so there's nothing objectionable. Just like the other episodes, the songs here are all a blast and the tone of the episode is just plain cheery.

The only con to this dvd? Like all other Nick Jr. titles, there are TONS of previews you have to skip through at the beginning. Other than that, this is another must buy for any parents of kids who love the Backyardigans...or something to have as a kind of guilty pleasure if you can't admit to loving these tracks!",1271462400,,2978,4.507407407407407

Even after he's watched a show he talks about the characters like they're his best friends, it's so cute!  It's Great to be a Ghost is his favorite of all the dvd's because the second episode (Monster Detective) is about a soccer monster who steals soccer balls and loves playing soccer which is my son's (and husband's) favorite sport!  They pretend to be soccer monsters and play soccer like Pablo, Uniqua, and Tyrone- I've watched these dvd's countless times and the Yardigans (as my son calls them) never get old, annoying, or repetitive!

I saw that it's available to purchase and realized that I would be the greatest Grandma ever if I gave it to him for Valentine's Day.

The characters are adorable without being the least bit sappy or excessive, the variety  -- and authenticity!-- of dance and music styles presented are just lovely, and the lessons taught are subtle and sweet.  (It helps that I am also a big fan of computer animation.)

My only complaint (hence the star deduction) is the same I have for most children's and ""children's"" (eg, sneaky adults') DVD releases -- why are they always put out in dribs and drabs, 2 or 3 episodes per DVD, rather than per season as most ""adult"" or mainstream series are? I feel slightly exploited whenever that happens. Other Nick shows have learned this lesson (""Avatar"" comes to mind) and have released larger collections -- why not ""Backyardigans""?

I'll collect them anyway -- perhaps high sales will encourage them to put out the larger collections.  Five-plus stars for the series itself.",1161993600,,1010,4.91764705882353

2326449,4,B0009W5IYW,"My daughter is an extremely music-and-motion oriented child, at the ripe old age of 5 1/2, she LOVES the Backyardigans.

I had recorded the episodes off of the tv for her, which were rather fuzzy, so when the DVD's started becoming available, we were both thrilled.

The big disappointment was when we tried to ""turn on the words"", as she calls it.  When you watch the show on Nick Jr. with a CC-enabled TV, you can read along with the show, GREAT learning tool for the pre-reading crowd.  Even the home-made videotape captured the coding for the CC and played it back on the TV.  (You have to record the show with the CC turned off, and like magic, they play back when you turn the CC on.)

With the huge budget required to create a CG-animated series,  I seriously wish the producers of the DVD had thown in this one extra!  (There are no other extras on this DVD, either.)

All four episodes on this DVD are fun, and the purchase is well worth your money, especially if you are into preschool entertainment that doesn't completely destroy adult brain-cells!",1136246400,2,1060,4.536842105263158

2326451,5,B0009W5IYW,"Don't let this brightly colored CGI cartoon fool you into thinking it's only for kids.  This is one you can watch for the umpteenth time without rolling your eyes way up in your head, and is one of the most entertaining shows to come out recently.

Each adventure takes place in the imagination of five young friends who turn their shared backyard into different fantasy worlds, each episode full of song and dance numbers of various music genres. Imagine hearing your kids singing `20s Jazz tunes while cartoon characters tap dance across the screen, and you'll pretty much get the idea.

This DVD has four episodes:

1. It's Great to Be a Ghost: This is the `20s Jazz episode, where Pablo (the blue penguin), Tyrone (the brown moose) and Uniqua (the pink spotted female of indeterminate species) pretend to be ghosts haunting an old house, and do their best to scare Tasha (the yellow hippo) an ""unsuspecting stranger"" who drops by the house.

2. Monster Detectives: This one has an early rock n' roll theme, and features Tyrone as a detective and Uniqua, who has lost her soccer ball, as they go to the castle of Pablo the Soccer Monster to get it back.

3. The Key to the Nile is another musical adventure, where Queen CleoTasha and her attendants Pablo, Tyrone and Austin (the purple kangaroo) seek three treasures of the Nile to present to the sphinx Uniqua.

4. Pirate Treasure is my favorite, set to a reggae beat, as the friends learn to work together to uncover buried treasure. Arrrr!

Janice Burgess has created a truly enjoyable, educational and fun series for all ages.

2326452,4,B0009W5IYW,"""The Backyardigans"" is a fairly new series now airing in the United States and Canada about a group of five friends who get together and have adventures in their backyards. There's a lot of singing (all really quite good) and the animation is crisp CGI. The characters each have different and interesting personalities and the stories are strong. This is a Nelvana production and includes many staff that have worked on shows such as ""Franklin."" You'll also find if you check the credits that many former members of the ""Blue's Clues"" crew write for this show as well. So if you like either of those shows, or even if you don't, there's a good chance you or your kids will like this!

This DVD has four complete episodes of the show --- ""It's Great To Be a Ghost!,"" ""Monster Detectives,"" ""The Key to the Nile,"" and ""Pirate Treasure."" These episodes have things to teach about bravery, politeness, facing your fears, speaking up and other important themes. So not only will you / your kids learn a lot, but you'll be entertained too.

The special features are as follows:

Promos --- These included promos for ""Dora's Dance to the Rescue,""Blue's Room"" on video and DVD, full length Dora specials and ""My Little Pony's A Very Minty Christmas."" You can't skip the promos at the start on the DVD version, although you can fast-forward through them.

""A Pirate Says Arr"" Music Video --- The best special feature on the disc. A music video version of one of the best songs from the included episodes.

Meet the Backyardigans --- Each Backyardigan is shown while an instrumental version of the main show theme plays. Facts about the characters are displayed on the screen, but aren't read out loud.

How to Be a Backyardigan --- Tips on how to dress up and stuff to become various things that the Backyardigans become, such as ghosts or pirates.

While the special features weren't thrilling, they were kind of nice. That's why I've given this four stars and not five --- I believe that in order for DVDs of this type to really stand out and be deserving of five stars, they must include great special features.

The audio does not have any subtitles available, but you can turn on close-captioning. Audio is English only, there are no options for other languages.",1131926400,17,2257,4.710659898477157

She is now 16 months old and she threw her first temper tantrum because she wanted to watch the backyardigans.. She has the huge stuffed animals of tyrone, uniqua, and pablo.  I'm so grateful that these adorable characters are finally hitting shelves.  Talk about a great xmas for her.  This DVD made traveling 10 hours in a car a whole lot easier.  It's a great dvd with bonus shows..",1131494400,,485,4.593023255813954

Could anyone please tell me if these DVDs have other languages besides English? Do they have the Spanish track?",1130198400,,222,4.55

2326456,4,B0009W5IYW,"I just recently bought this for my daughter in my department at work since we enjoy watching Backyardigans on tv.  I am glad that they have 4 episodes on the dvd.  The extras could have been better, so I only gave this 4 stars.

The colors are very vibrant and the songs are pleasent and catchy.  I haven't come across one that is annoying.  My daughter isn't interested in other shows like Dora, Max & Ruby, etc, so I'm glad she is interested in Backyardigans.  She dances along to them and even laughs.

I recommend this show to anyone who wants something GOOD for their child to watch.  Thank you Nick Jr for having a decent show out.  Now my daughter can take time out from playing, and watch/sing/dance to some entertaining characters, it is one show I am glad she watches and will watch with her.",1129680000,3,802,4.401360544217687
2326457,5,B0009W5IYW,"Dora and Blue's Clues really saved my sanity from the big purple monster but the one thing they didn't have as much of were alot of songs that my kids could sing along with. For that Barney was (unfortunately) still the king of sing along songs. But then along came the Backyardigans and I was saved! My 21 month old daughter loves to sing and dance along with the Backyardigans. Yes, she sings along! Ok, so it's a little jumbled and babbling, but some key words come through. Her favorite song is the theme song and also the Pirate song and her Ar's are clear as day! Even my 6 year old and 4 year old love to sing along to the catchy tunes and enjoy the incredible animation. I'm surprised that someone earlier on thought the singing was horrendous. I disagree. The singing is great, better than any Barney song ever recorded, and the songs are catchy. This is one of those series that I will probably end up buying every episode for. My only issue is that I still can't figure out what the heck that Uniqua character is.",1129593600,3,1024,4.366492146596858
2326458,5,B0009W5IYW,"We bought It's Great to Be a Ghost for my son's birthday and he's been watching it several times a DAY. Fortunately, The Backyardigans are amusing and witty!

The fun segments include:

IT'S GREAT TO BE A GHOST!

Pablo, Tyrone and Uniqua are ghosts, haunting an old house to the sounds of '20s-style jazz. When unsuspecting Tasha drops by, they really put their scaring skills to the test! (In this episode, it's interesting to see the ghost-like renderings of the characters. The animators have done a top-notch job!)

MONSTER DETECTIVE

60s-style rock underscores Tyrone's adventures as a no-nonsense detective helping his client Uniqua to retrieve her soccer ball from the castle of the Soccer Monster (Pablo)! (My son goes around the house growling SOCCER MONSTER!)

It's Great To Be A Ghost is a wonderful video that will be sure to enrapture children. However, because The Backyardigans are so amusing, witty, and colorful--featuring great toe-tapping songs and vibrant animation--don't be surprised if you, as an adult, fall in love with it, as well!",1128902400,2,1057,5.116279069767442

The Backyardigans are clever, imaginative and the music is incredibly addictive.  We had a 17 hour odyssey during the Texan Hurricane Rita evacuation and they were happy the entire trip.  This Backyardigans DVD gets a lot of the credit for that.  They truly enjoy this DVD and, to be honest, I keep hearing, ""I want my river back..."" in my head.  My son calls them the Snackyardigans but we all love them just the same.",1127952000,,550,4.29126213592233

I bought this DVD thinking that it only had two episodes on it (It's Great to Be a Ghost and Monster Detectives), so I was more than pleasantly surprised when it actually had four episodes, one of the ""extra"" two being the Pirate Treasure episode.  Since receiving the DVD on Saturday, I think we've watched it fifty times.  It's fantastic.  I highly recommend it--the songs are awesome and the characters are adorable.  Again, when Noggin stopped playing the episodes after only a few weeks, I didn't know what I was going to do every time my son wanted to watch it...now I don't have to worry about it!

They do an amazing job of utilizing different musical styles!  It is not the type of video that will have you trying to lose/break it (accidentally of course).,1127520000,4,314,4.362068965517241
2326465,5,B0009W5IYW,"This DVD is great! My daughters love it, and would have watched it all day if I'd let them. I highly recommend it to anyone who has a child who loves music, or who loves good music themselves.

It isn't apparent from the picture, but this DVD gives you four episodes. You can choose to play them all, or play just one. In the order they play, they are:

  *It's Great to be a Ghost - Did you ever play at being scared when you were little, until you actually worked yourself up into being scared? In this episode, the Backyardigans pretend to be ghosts, but it's all fun and games - for a while.

  *Monster Detectives - When Uniqua's ball is stolen by the Soccer Monster (Pablo), it's up to Tyrone, the Monster Detective, to help her get it back.

  *The Key to the Nile - When Egypt suffers a drought it's up to self-centered Princess Tasha to find the key to restoring the Nile. But will she ever remember to thank the faithful servants who are doing all the real work?

  *Pirate Treasure - Two sets of pirates (you can tell they're pirates by the way they say, ""Arrr!"") are looking for the same treasure on a desert island.

Each episode starts with the same opening musical number you see on television, and ends with a closing credits sequence that I thought was a little lengthy, but that my daughters didn't seem to mind at all.

I have to admit I was disappointed by the Special Features. The first two special features require reading skills, which makes things difficult for parents if their children can't read. Since the Backyardigans' target audience age is 2 to 5 that's probably going to be most of us who are interested in owning this DVD.

  *Meet the Backyardigans - This feature presents each of the Backyardigans, one at a time. They do not move, but are presented as stiff drawings (I was reminded of paper dolls) bouncing around against the show's backyard play area. At the bottom of the screen is a description of the pictured character. There is background music (the music from the opening sequence), but no voiceover reading of the description.

  *How to Be a Backyardigan - As with the first special feature, this one requires an ability to read or a parent with the patience to read and reread ad infinitum. Pictures of the various Backyardigans doing things from the shows are shown, with written instructions on how to be like that character. Example: Picture of Pablo playing drums. Written next to it is, Be a MUSICIAN How to be a musician like Austin: Bang your drums, Play the tuba, Say, ""Let's polka!"" You use the remote to move on to the next character.

  *""A Pirate Says Arrr"" Music Video - By far the best of the special features. Scenes from the episode are arranged pleasingly. My only quibble is that it isn't the full song from the episode and it ends a little abruptly. My girls loved it though, and asked me to replay it several times.

  *Previews - Ads for other DVDs being released in fall 2005.

I wanted this for the episodes, though, not the special features, so it's not an issue for me.

Overall, I have to give this high marks, because it is, after all, the Backyardigans! Which is the first kid's show that I enjoy as much as my children.",1126828800,7,3197,4.482698961937716

She actually picked up using please and thank you from The Key to the Nile episode. This is by far the best young kids program on television right now. It teaches children to pretend play.
