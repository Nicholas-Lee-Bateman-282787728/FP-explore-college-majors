1068848,4,6305784906,"I like this movie, it's the first Bond Movie with Pierce Brosnan that i like. The story is in the beginning what vage but it is entertaning until the end. This is one of the Bond movies you just have to see.",951091200,,207,3.9523809523809526
1068849,5,6305784906,"Pierce Brosnan's third outing as James Bond and a slew of controversy if it will be his last.
Feeling responsible for the death of a British oil tycoon and a friend, who died in an explosion in MI6 headquarters, James  Bond takes position as bodyguard to the tycoon's daughter, Elektra (Sophie  Marceau), who has a mysterious past and hidden agenda.
In recent weeks,  Brosnan has gone on record saying he wants more revealing and sexier love  scenes in Bond and he would love to see Bond killed off. He has also said  he wouldn't mind leaving Bond behind. Are these the greatest things to be  saying upon the opening of the film?
It would be such a shame when he  seems to be playing Bond right and having a script that wants us to see  more Bond.
I guess the next question to ask is who or what is Bond? And  why that element makes a good Bond film. A superior Bond film is always in  the script and the intrigue associated with a spy. In the latest film the  script always has two levels going on coupled with a pain within Bond  himself. These play off each other as the perpetual hero shows the signs of  being human. In the past 5 Bond films they have been trying to make him  more human and it really isn't till this one that they seem to have located  the angle they sought. Betrayed, injured, and scorned are just some of the  emotions I haven't seen in Bond in years. And that's exactly why this one  works and why it's the best Bond in ten years.
With this revelation,  director Michael Apted's action sequences and locales seem to be fleshed  out and in the highest of Bond form. Apted pushes the envelope with a great  Bond finale which pivots Bond and the villain dueling in a submarine  spiraling towards the bottom of the ocean. This sequence is true Bond and  reminds me a lot of the great climaxes of the 80's pictures.
Within the  cast is the always brilliant Sophie Marceau who's innocent but brutal  Elektra is going to be a fondly remembered Bond girl. Wasted is 2nd Bond  girl Denise Richards who seems to be quite out of her element and made me  thinking that these two could be father and daughter instead of lovers.  Richards looks like a teen and is supposed to be a ""Lara Croft type  nuclear expert""? Rounding out the rest of the cast is ""the man  who can feel no pain"" Renard played deviously by Robert Carlyle.  Carlyle reminded me a lot of Sean Bean's 006 in ""Goldeneye"".
With this entry into the Bond vault I hope Brosnan comes back for at  least two or three more. Connery and Moore did over six each why can't  Brosnan. So here is to the continuation of the franchise.  I hope the DVD  release is every bit as good as the film and the previous Bond DVD  releases.",951091200,9,2696,4.3346693386773545
1068850,4,6305784906,"I am a Bond fan, and fan of Bronson as Bond(maybe he's even the best Bond). This Bond does offer a few more twists than the previous helpings but still keeping to the old Bond formula which as been of great success.  The Bond girls sexy as ever, but I did have a problem with Denise  Richards(Dr Christmas) as a Doctor(she just doesn't look the part), but who  cares its Bond. The action is quick, lines funny(the ones about Dr.  Christmas are the best yet) and the best open scene of all the Bonds. One  of my favourite Bonds, but maybe not as good as Goldeneye. This will be a  great DVD to have. If you don't like Bond, you won't like it, if you do  you'll love it.",951091200,,668,4.131782945736434
1068851,4,6305784906,"From the opening speedboat chase on the river Thames, to a spectacular helicopter sequence, W.I.N.E. is in keeping w/ the tradition.  Brosnan is in top form as 007, and the involvement of Dame  Judi Dench as  ""M"" into the storyline is creative.  Although popular opinion  declares Denise Richards as the worst Bond girl, it seems that she wasn't  given a lot to work with.  Marceau commands attention as the beautiful  Elecktra King, the film's central character.
The movie is not without  flaws.  Carlise is a sympathetic villian but he's no 006 or Blofeld.  Richard's Dr. Christmas Jones almost seems thrown in as a secondary  character and juxtaposition to King(Marceau).
The story is solid and  will require some attention to the first-time Bond veiwer (and if you are,  where have you been for the last 38 years).
Finally, special thanks to  returning Bond composer, David Arnold, for delivery a stunning soundtrack  which is a wonderful fusion of modern techno and old-time John Barry (I'm  listening to it as I'm writing this).
All in all, W.I.N.E. is a perfect  addition to the ever-growing Bond series & with the current releases of  Bond DVD's, I look forward to spinning this up in my player.",951004800,4,1203,4.895522388059701

1068854,3,6305784906,This wasn't up there with the best Bond films but is worth a look.  Brosnan puts in another solid performance and Denise Richards looks as stunning as ever.

1068855,2,6305784906,"It wasn't charming as the first ones and, considering how ""special effects"" have improved in the past years, the new movie isn't trilling as it ancestors. If it wasn't for ""good old times"", I wouldn't  even care to buy such a movie.",950745600,2,232,4.523809523809524

The  World is not enough shows great direction and is a crowd pleaser from the  opening sequences to the closing credits - Something for everyone, clever  creativity and wonderful graphics!

1069007,4,6305784906,"The world is not enough(1999) begins with a spectacular opening title sequence that is very exciting and thrilling to watch as James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) plays a banker but looks like an accountant and escapes from an office building after beating up the bad guys and gets into a speed boat chase scene with a lot of explosions and almost gets killed trying to save a super- beautiful woman . Then the beautiful title song ""The world is not enough , but it is a such perfect place to start my love and if you are strong enough, together we can take the world apart my love ! by garbage starts playing. The rest of the film is ok with some cool and amazing action scenes and adventures in faraway lands and casinos as bond tries to protect the daughter of an agent who was killed by a terrorist only to find out she is a terrorist to. Pierce Brosnan is definitely  charismatic and cool as James Bond and is one of the best actors to play James Bond.",1512000000,,949,4.301675977653631
1069008,4,6305784906,"After a 6-year hiatus after Licence to Kill, the Bond franchise finally resumed with a very modern style Bond look and feel with 1995's Goldeneye. That film reinvented Bond to a degree, with a new actor (Pierce Brosnan) and stepped outside of the Ian Fleming novel approach. The result was a unique but welcomed film that's one of the better Bond offerings. Fast forward 4 years to 1999's The World is Not Enough, and the franchise is starting to look and feel tired again, with some weaker plots, bland acting, and an emphasis on action. I give this film 4 stars as the benefit of the doubt, because this film still has neat gadgetry, great stunts, and SOME of the old magic of previous 007 films. This film feels like a cross between For Your Eyes Only, The Living Daylights, and Goldeneye. Pierce Brosnan is a good Bond, but his performance suffers a bit due to a weaker plot; he never quite lives up to the promise he showed in Goldeneye. This film has energy, but at the same time it's anemic. The theme song is forgettable and is a crashing bore, and there's hardly anything that's emotional of memorable throughout the film. Still, this Bond film is well-made, and deserves a little praise. It almost seems, however, that the Bond films of the 90's ('95, '97, '99) were hurried into production, almost as if any script was acceptable, as long as they could get 3 films done by the end of the decade. As for the blu ray, it has great picture and sound quality, and the special features are good as usual. I recommend The World is not Enough for Bond diehards, but it certainly isn't where I'd start my collection; try the early Connery films first.",1511740800,,1654,4.535117056856187

This is a formula Bond movie. It has all the toys and witticisms that make it Bond. You may have to get over Denise Richards' stereotype as the bug lady from ""Starship Troopers"" (1997).

1069615,4,6305784906,"A marked improvement from Tomorrow Never Dies (though not a difficult feat), The World is Not Enough features an excellent Bond title, a good theme song and the second best Bond girl of the Brosnan era in the beautiful Sophie Marceau (Famke Janssen's Xenia Onatopp being first). On the other hand it also has one of the worst Bond girls in the entire franchise with Denise Richard's character Dr. Christmas Jones. This has been something that has plagued the Pierce Brosnan films after Goldeneye. Terrible Bond girls either because of bad casting decisions, poorly written dialogue or a combination of both.

As we enter the beginning of the CG era with TWINE, we start to see only some of what is going to eventually haunt the franchise forever in ""Die Another Day"". There are a few scenes with pretty dated CGI that understandably does not hold up to the test of time. On the improved side of things, we finally get a legitimized Bond villain again, one who is formidable, intimidating and best of all, tough. All things Jonathan Pryce's character from Tomorrow Never Dies could have only hoped to be.

Action is probably what the Brosnan series was known for best, and the action scenes in World is Not Enough are entertaining AND meaningful. The classic Bond snow skiing sequence, the underground pursuit as well as the scenes with the buzz saw helicopters are all memorable. The gadget use isn't ridiculous or over the top, but rather appropriate and pretty reasonable (for a James Bond movie).

The finale hosts a showdown between 007 and Renard, the man who feels no pain, in a classic matchup with nuclear weapons hanging in the balance. In the end The World is Not Enough is easily the second best Brosnan Bond flick after Goldeneye, if only the follow up could have been even close to this level.

1069620,4,6305784906,"Goldeneye seemed to balance the story and action- both done well. TND on the other hand focused more on entertaining action than it did on its plot. Then here's TWINE, which focuses more on its plot than the action. That's not to say it isn't action packed, and honestly the balance between story and action scenes feels much more natural than both Goldeneye and TND. The problem is the action isn't shot exceptionally well, which is its major problem (yes, more than Denise Richards' performance).

There are awesome ideas for the action scenes and the second unit had the tools at their desposal to execute them well. They just didn't shoot the action in a very exciting manner- it just doesn't feel inspired and it doesn't have a punch to it like Goldeneye did. Again, great ideas, but firefights don't feel exhilarating, explosions aren't a sight to behold and there's no suspense in the action scenes.

That being said the story is, as far as most Bond films go, very good. Besides Denise Richards' Christmas Jones, all major characters have depth and a story to them, including M who has a much bigger part in the story this time (a great decision, as Judy Dench is too good to waste on just a mission briefing). Even Bond, played excellently by Pierce Brosnan in his third outing, is written much more interestingly than in say most of Moore's films. This is more like Licence to Kill, The Living Daylights, Skyfall and OHMSS(which this film has some homages and references to) than TSWLM, Octopussy or AVTAK. The more entertaining Bond films are great as well, but it's always nice to have a more story driven Bond film.

The exposition is shot very well, you hear and understand everything you need to, but it's the second unit who did a shabby job here with the mediocre action scenes. Goldeneye's exposition was shot similarly but it knew that the action had to be shot differently to stand out- TWINE's action scenes are shot the same way the exposition is shot, which is extremely weird. Everything feels too planned out, no excitement to it, just shabbily done.

All in all, great plot, interesting characters, great performances (besides Denise Richards), fantastic score, very entertaining and while being more plot focused it still offers the escapism escapism of the rest of the series. Just most of the action isn't exhillerating. If you're new to Bond films, or even a Bond fan (in that case you've probably already seen it) TWINE is highly recommended.",1479772800,,2473,4.7981220657277

Sad to see Desmond Llewellyn bid us farewell. My big beef is with the choice of Denise Richards.  Movie starts off well. I remember being shocked at the explosion at MI headquarters when viewing at the theatre many years ago.  And it's good ride - the way many Bond movies stick to the formula...for the first half. But Richards' is more wooden than should be.  It is my least favorite of the Brosnan-era Bond movies.",1479254400,,559,4.56

1071458,4,6305784906,"Brosnan as Bond should've had a longer run. This feature has plenty of 007 gadgets, Bond Girls and action.

1074314,5,6305784906,"Occasionally in an action film series, one of its entries attempts to deal with the persona of its hero with equal intensity as it handles its central storyline. Such is the case with THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH. Director Michael Apted attempted to show James Bond's obsession for a woman, Sophie Marceau, for whom he had become intrigued with. Mishandled and mistreated by British Intelligence, Bond becomes enamored with her plight and tries to rectify it out of his attraction for her. Unfortunately this idea never came satisfactorily across upon this film's initial release. The change of pace to the Bond formula and Brosnan's desire to expand the depth of the James Bond character never seemed to come to fruition at the time. Somehow I think some of the action elements essential to this plotline got in the way. For instance, the opening sequence in Patrick Malahide's office demonstrates Bonds skills instantly take control a situation and an intensity to avenge the fate of a fellow operative. This is a great action scene and his driven emotional energy. In contradiction, the pipeline scene with Brosnan and Denise Richards is perfunctory and mundane and does not advance any of the complexities of Bond's character or plot of the film for that matter. Reexamining the film, I also see a complex relation between villain Robert Carlyle and Sophie Marceau and even Judi Dench as M and Sophie Marceau. This film abounds with complexities that were somehow overshadowed by the hype that surrounded it. It is another good Bond film. All that being said, Pierce Brosnan really has the part of James Bond down to an art and science in a rather ethereal fashion.",1449619200,2,1664,4.925266903914591
1074492,5,6305784906,Over 15 years since this movie's been released & the boat chase on the Thames is still one of the best action packed chase's in any movie. The intensity never lets up in this movie. Haters don't understand a good movie when they see one! Even the TWINE video game is still awesome.

1074496,3,6305784906,"Pierce Brosnan is James Bond. He gets some money back for someone. But the money is a bomb. So he unknowingly takes it back to MI6 where the owner is blown up. He then is asked to watch out for the dead man's daughter. For some reason the dead man is friends with M so she (now played by Judi Dench) feels obligated to protect the grown orphan.

From here I get lost. Someone gets killed. Some mean guy shows up. Some more people get killed. Someone gets some plutonium and a submarine to blow up the Caspian Sea so the oil pipeline is needed. Or something. It all gets confusing.

The acting is poor. I have always thought that Brosnan is a decent actor for your typical person situation. But to feign duress or what have you he over does it. It is so fake. Goofy actually. And Denise Richards is OK too. But some of her lines make her sound idiotic. ""There is too much hydrogen. I have to . . . stop . . . it"" as she crawls up a sinking submarine. Just sounded laugh out loud robotic hilarious. But I suppose I am picking her apart. Overall she was fine. For some reason this Bond movie reminded me of so many others. It was deja vu. There was a little ""View to a Kill"" in here. There was a little ""For Your Eyes Only"" in here. There was even a little ""Thunderball"" and ""Live and Let Die"".

As for the DVD itself? Well the 5.1 sound mixing is awful. Everything sounds hollow in this movie. Nothing I could do to make it sound better. I have watched A LOT of movies on my system with great results/sound, but this one was a joke - especially for an action flick.

It isn't a waste of time if you like bond films but unless you are trying to Watch all 20+ films I think you should pass. Pierce is fine but the writing is awful.",1441929600,,598,4.059322033898305

1074501,5,6305784906,"With two Bond films under his belt, Pierce Brosnan was now quite comfortable as Bond in this film. ""The World Is Not Enough"" is an excellent action film with a smart script. The story is a mix of a tragedy, political thriller and transitions. In this film, Bond comes across human and sensitive to Elektra King (Sophie Marceau) who is dealing with the loss of her father and a kidnapping ordeal. The villain is Renard (Robert Carlyle), a former Russian operative who feels no pain due to a bullet lodged in his brain. He really has no main henchman (a change) but has an ace up his sleave which adds to the suspense. Also in the mix is a strained (?) relationship between M (Judi Dench) and Elektra King.  The plot involves an oil pipeline to the west, stolen nukes and a lot of twists and turns. Returning is Robbie Coltrane as the larcenous but helpful (when pushed) ,Valentin Zukovsky in his farewell apearance. There is one weakness in this film, this miscasting of Denise Richards as Dr. Christmas Jones, a nuclear weapons scientist (?). There is also a changing of the guard in Q's department. Desmond Llewellyn bids farewell and John Cleese is introduced. Overall, this is a spy action film of the first rank.",1438819200,,1216,4.62962962962963

1075202,3,6305784906,"After 2 films with Pierce Brosnan as James Bond, both he and I had settled in.  He added a nice sophistication to the role while keeping a mean streak coexisting with some humor.  This film was vilified by critics primarily by the miscasting of Denise Richards as nuclear scientist Dr. Christmas Jones.  On that subject I would agree.  I don't even think Ms. Richards believed in the roll and while her gams were great to look at, she occasionally had to deliver lines.  And bad lines they were.  The script here leaves much to be desired.

With Richards in the good Bond Girl role, there are a couple evil ones that Bond must deal with.  Early on it is Maria Grazia Cucinotta as Cigar Girl who kills an oil-billionaire (David Calder) and good friend of ""M"" (Judi Dench).  She leads 007 on a terrific chase through the river Thames with Bond using a rocket propelled prototype.

""M"" sends Bond to protect her late friend's daughter Elektra (Sophie Marceau) who has taken over her daddy's business which is currently building a pipeline through central Asia.  There's a competing interest headed by the evil Renard (Robert Carlyle).  In addition to Christmas, Bond's other on-site ally is Valentin Zukovsky (Robbie Coltrane, returning from ""Goldeneye"") who also provides some comic relief.  In addition to the action sequences, Brosnan works well with Ms. Marceau in their scenes.  Carlyle, an excellent actor, seems underutilized making his character one of the most forgettable in the series.  Overall this is a pretty vanilla Bond film and certainly a letdown for Brosnan and the series.

The Blu ray version I watched is certainly a big improvement over the DVD.  Using a 2.35:1 aspect ratio the film comes in 1080p video resolution.  The filming locations exemplify the look of the film to some degree.  Gone are the beauty and color of the Caribbean or other resort locations.  Here we get drab London and even drabber former Soviet states.  Don't get me wrong the disc looks fine, but don't expect the eye-popping creation of earlier films.  One exception is when Bond enters a casino wearing blue lensed X-ray enhanced glasses.  All the better to check out those bad girls and where they are packing heat.  The audio has a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track and it works fine.  Like the video there's often little to work with.  The sinking submarine offers some surround action but there's also a lot of yakking going on in this film.  The dialog is clear and easily understood.  Rock band ""Garbage"" (Shirley Manson) handle the title song, but the closing credits only feature the standard Bond theme song.  Dolby Digital 5.1 is available in French and Spanish.  Subtitles are available in English SDH, Spanish, Korean and Mandarin.  Here are the extras:

He played his part great and took the role very serious and ramped up the action and stunts.

1075844,4,6305784906,"The World is not Enough was in my viewpoint a four star James Bond movie worth the five dollars I paid for it.  I agree with mutiple people on the reviews the movie seem to drag in certain scenes then blow you away in other scenes.  I feel the movie was saved by the acting job by Brosnan and Richards playing the smart hot chick.  But if it wasn't for that and the good gun fights, things being blown up, and so forth then the movie would have been very bad.  So if your just looking for a James Bond movie based soely on Revenge then this is the movie for you, plus you get some good character revelations between the MI6 personal that make you go really? Might make jaw drop some,  but I enjoy the movie as a whole even the dragging scenes.  Well worth five dollars if you don't have this Bond movie yet then buy it.",1371772800,3,819,4.0875
1075845,4,6305784906,My views are somewhat bias because I would like to own all the 007 James Bond films.

Sophie Marceau, as Electra King, is all over the map: she's weak, she's strong, she's humane, she's sadistic -- and Bond (Brosnan) just eats it up. With Renard (Robert Carlyle), they make up one of the most interesting villain pairs in the franchise. She manages to give us all (as well as Bond) a real ""pain in the neck."" Haven't seen Bond sweat so much since a laser was inching its way up to his crotch in Goldfinger.

1076183,5,6305784906,"Sure, there are a few laughs with the bits of incredible gravity-defying escapist movie physics, but overall Brosnan's third installment as Bond brings the charm-meets-darkness that the role properly requires he delivers the balance between corny and dramatic that makes the series the popcorn-eating action-fun fest it is intended to be. This is one of my favorite opening sequences for the way it establishes the storyline and offers up the perfect mix of action payoff and cliffhanger before the opening titles actually kick in. Plus, the title song is performed by Garbage, fronted by Scottish singing powerhouse Shirley Manson. She lends just enough rock with power ballad tinges to make a Bond song modern, yet classic. This film also employs a particularly fine cast not the least of which is a the authentic Bond ingredient: Desmond Llewellyn as Q-branch's chief of tech trickery in his last role before tragically being killed in a motor accident. Coincidentally, this film introduces a less paternal guru of gadgets, the all-thumbs 'R' (really a nickname, since Q is the shortening of Quartermaster Branch, and major Boothroyd is ""Q""'s actual character name.) As if that weren't enough star power, a few others on the list of classy Brit talent: Michael Kitchen, Robbie Coltrane, Colin Slmon and Judi Dench. Rounding it out is a love interest that can really act: Sophie Marceau, famously from Braveheart. The film is a well-executed sequence of Bond getting kitted out, escaping/chasing/fighting the baddies, and shagging his way around the globe for king and country.

1076512,5,6305784906,"The Bond movie starts right off with action.  Bond (Pierce Brosnan) is picking up money stolen from Sir Robert King who is a friend of M.  The banker is about to tell Bond who killed 0012 and took the money when the banker is killed by a thrown knife into the back of his neck.  Bond escapes after several close calls with death and manages to take the money with him.

He returns to London and gives the cash to the authorities only to have Sir Robert King killed by the money which was booby trapped. Bond chases the assassin and he discovers that the assassin is the banker's assistant who killed the banker with the knife.  He traps her after a dramatic boat chase in the Thames River but she kills herself and nearly takes Bond with her.

Bond is assigned to guard Sir Robert's daughter Electra (Sophie Marceau).  This is because she is linked to the possible murderer of her father as the man had abducted Electra and held her for ransom in the past.  He is a former KGB agent who now works as a terrorist named Renard (Robert Carlyle). Bond Visits her at the site of where the international pipeline is being built and almost immediately has to save her life and his from assassins.....

This is a high action Bond thriller like all of them.  It features two beautiful actresses in Sophie Marceau and Denise Richards (as Doctor Christmas Jones) and it makes for a suspenseful plot with an evil madman trying to cause a catastrophe.  With action scenes and stunts while in the air, snow covered mountains, and under water, this movie will keep you interested in seeing the suspenseful ending.  The madman is committed to finishing his plan and Bond is just as committed to stop his plan for disaster.

1076513,2,6305784906,"[1] Almost a tick-box check list of features of 1950-2000 mass braindead entertainment.
* Cars exploding with vast amounts of fuel
* Product placement of buildings - London waste of money dome, Bilbao?, Thames... - so the studio shots seem to be somewhere
* A chase or two to allow suspension of thought - amphibious, skiing, powered parachute, supposedly in a submarine...
* Fights (fists usually) between a few characters.  At least they don't sword fight.  Enlivened with a few planned kicks, and moves designed around props.
* Exotic-ish locations
* Special effects; here we have a five-part cutting device, designed quite well,
* Has to be in English.  All the characters speak accented EEngleesh, Meest-air Bond.  There's a filmic joke about 'Mummerset' rural English; here we have something like 'Mussian'
* Official views of history taken for granted; in practice this means Zionist.  The ridiculous Judi Dench as head of something also illustrates the feminist thing.  There are some embarrassingly sidelined black actors.  'Terrorism' of course is something 'they' do.
* Big wads of paper money!
* Ritualistic casino/ hotel room sex - to be fair the film makers could hardly show anything less dismal.
* No impact bullets so that people aren't upset by what bullets do. With lasers. But nothing more recent.

[2] Interesting more up to date themes..
* Swiss banker shown with thuggish colleagues.  This must be a reference to Jews extorting money from the Swiss by the 'Holocaust' (TM) fraud.
* Nuclear stuff even more stylised than usual, with obvious designoid artefacts.  This is the fraud that ran and ran.  Interestingly, here it's in phase-out mode.  It allows the female nuclear physicist, always half-dressed, considered necessary so that the way 'nuclear weapons' work isn't too obvious, despite the Carlyle baddie character understanding all about it.
* Interesting references to oil pipelines (or possibly gas) with graphics showing pipes snaking over landscapes, which may or may not have been models or computer graphics.  This is a bit puzzling, since the motives for killing Afghans and others were kept secret; how many people have heard of TAPI?  I take it that before the Jewish 9/11 fraud a couple of years later the pipeline(s) were considered done deals.",1347148800,,2285,5.123989218328841
1076659,4,6305784906,"Pierce Brosnan returned for Round 3 as the legendary James Bond in the franchise's 1999  installment, ""The World is Not Enough,"" co-starring elegant Sophie Marceau (as oil heiress Elektra King), Robert Carlyle (as villainous Renard), and Denise Richards (as physicist Dr. Christmas Jones), with expanded roles for returnees Judi Dench (as M) and Robbie Coltrane (as opportunistic mobster Valentin Zukovsky).  Brosnan reportedly insisted upon far more character depth and a less complicated story this time.  Fortunately, he only got the former, as much like 1995's ""Goldeneye,"" this film posseses an impressively sophisticated storyline and logical plot twists making it a very worthy entry for the now-50 year old Bond franchise.

All the best elements of 007's Pierce Brosnan era (1995-2002) are present in this movie: an awesome title song by Garbage, sleek acting, adrenaline-pumping stunts, and an intelligently written script offering genuine international suspense and plenty of slam-bang for the buck.  The film's only significant detriment is the inexplicable miscasting of Denise Richards as a nuclear physicist.  Obviously, the Bond production team sacrificed credibility for eye candy, but Richards tries her best to no avail.  Even so, it proves a costly, distracting error in the film's second half when the extent of the villains' scheme takes precedence, and Bond's supposed back-up in defusing a stolen nuclear bomb simply appears so implausible.  Instead, perhaps stunning Maria Grazia Cuccinotta (seen in the pre-credits sequence as the ill-fated ""Cigar Girl) should have received an expanded role and participated as Bond's cohort in order to seek some payback against Renard.  Yes, it is a moot point, but the Bond production team should have already learned its lesson from similarly inept choices for Bond Girls in ""Diamonds Are Forever"" and ""View to a Kill.""

Ultimately, despite the Denise Richards casting issue, ""The World is Not Enough"" deserves recognition for a classy, top-notch Bond film that is willing to take chances in order to best serve the surprisingly provocative script. In conclusion, special kudos should be given to Brosnan, Marceau, Carlyle, Dench, and Coltrane for keeping audiences guessing as to what will happen next.  In closing, the classy final scene of Desmond Llewellyn as Q was the worth the price of admission for me, as his few moments of screen time far outclassed his buffoonish replacement in John Cleese.

Rating: 8/10 stars. For ages 13 and up for some disturbing scenes re: torture.",1346198400,,2545,5.38287153652393
1076660,4,6305784906,"The World Is Not Enough is Pierce Brosnan's third outing as 007. It's a fun, fast-moving action movie with a lot to offer. There is of course a pretty scientist, an interesting chase scene and a villainess/victim (watch the movie) who covers her behind-the-scenes activities well enough that some viewers may not pick her out as a co-conspirator until all the facts are lined up. The main bad guy in fact even has an interesting motive for his actions given that he himself is dying and will not live to see the plot come to fruition.

  A lot of heat has been thrown at this Bond film because of Denise Richards' wardrobe in her performance as Christmas Jones, a nuclear physicist. Her acting was fine to me but I can understand that short-shorts and a tank-top may seem strange choices in clothes for a scientist who disables nuclear warheads. However, note that the work is being done in Kazakhstan which is a country with a lot of hot, arid regions which when you add on a protective suit, equals a lot of body heat. So give the character some slack.

  The chase scenes involving Bond and a female assassin in the early stages of the film are un-remarkable but fun. The later chase scenes through the snowy Caucasus Mountains in Azerbaijan are much better. Who wouldn't like snowmobiles that apparently can fly?

  As mentioned above, the villains in this film are among the more interesting Bond foes over the years. The first main villain, Robert Carlyle's Renard, is a Soviet terrorist who has a bullet in his head that is inching deeper into his brain over time and will soon kill him. The other is an oil tycoon's daughter named Elektra King, played by Sophie Marceau, who having basically had her father assassinated, wants to destroy oil pipelines in the Middle-East to make sure a new one she is building will be the only one, thus making her ridiculously wealthy. There is more to her story but you will have to watch the movie to find out. At any rate, both characters are both interesting and fleshed out very well.

  Finally, Brosnan's Bond is not as silly as some of the Roger Moore outings but he is also not very close to Ian Fleming's book versions either. He quips frequently and is less serious than the Connery, Dalton or current Craig versions. Still, his take on the character is fun and fits the fast style of the film very well. The technology is borderline over-the-top in this Bond outing but in the end does not take away from the movie too much. The HD picture and sound quality are great and the extras are fun. All in all, this is a good movie. I give it four stars.",1344124800,3,2601,4.534188034188034
1076661,5,6305784906,One of the best James bond movies. Opening scenes before the beginning credits are awsome. Action scenes are great. What more could you ask for in a 007 movie?,1342310400,,159,4.517241379310345
1076662,1,6305784906,"On the most recent Brosnen-Bond attempt:

We have the most two dimensional predictable female villainess since ""Never Say Never Again"".  Susan Stark of the Detroit News claims ""She (Sophie Marceau) turns out to be the most complex female character ever introduced in the series, and one of the most seductive.""  That's one theory.  Actually, when they tried to make her seem less two dimensional by having her acting all sad that her boyfriend was destined to impotency, it seemed stupid, unconvincing, and if at all possible, it would have happened when they met (if at all).  ""Oh,"" Susan might say, ""that's the profound effect that Remington had on her.""  If it's true that her heart was rehabilitated, the effect should have lasted beyond the one scene.

""I'm going to check on the pipeline.""  They get their skis, they ski, they're attacked.  Bad guys all go after Pierce instead of the chick whose life they're supposed to be threatening...he knows the terrain well enough to pull out of a slalom just before going over a cliff.  Everyone is saved.  We never even see the pipeline at this location.  (A co-viewer recalls seeing pipeline markers, though.  So then, the pipeline was under the snow?  Did she plan to thaw it?  Why is the corporate head ""going down to check on the pipeline"" anyway?  Don't contractors do that sort of thing, rather than financiers?

I can buy that perhaps a 00 agent might be familiar with a boat which is being developed, and he could be thorough enough to know what sort of impact it could withstand.  I don't buy that he is also familiar enough with the encasing building's architecture to know that his boat's structural integrity exceeds that of the wall of the building holding it.  It is also implausible that the drag force resulting from the wall collision would have negligible effect on the momentum of the boat.  He should have crashed in the street instead of landing in the water.  A five minute Bond film, I think, would be a very cool way to end the series.  Oh well.

Water has a high coefficient of friction compared to air.  It is physically impossible for his boat to travel at the same velocity under water (especially with an open roof) as it did in the air.  Watching carefully, his boat did indeed flip over, the effect of which was edited out.

Lastly, regarding the boat sequence, such a thing was done more believably in ""Live And Let Die"".  It was even reprised in ""Moonraker.""

We go from the boat scene in ""Live and Let Die"" to the skiing scene from ""The Spy Who Loved Me"", once again, done better in the original.  Well, we also did have the skiing scenes in ""For Your Eyes Only"".  Predictable is perhaps the best adjective to describe the bad guy's x-wing having a parachute on it.  So much for suspense.  And how about the gratuitous x-wings crashing into each other for no reason?

And then at the nuclear site, chaos starts breaking loose, Brosnen's first thought is 'save the pretty girl, even if she did expose me as an imposter.'  Very realistic.

So why, if Judy Dench is so great as M, does she have fear and nervousness in her eyes as she admonishes Remington?  We all know refusing to deal with terrorists is standard operating procedure, including the spoiled brat.  Why is ""M"" acting guilty about it?

Bond's ""doctor"" was not in any way behaviorably believable.  Nor was it believable that a top agent would go out in the field with a badly damaged shoulder, unless it was unavoidable.  He'd be risking his life as well as his mission.

Bah!  Implausible.",1336435200,2,3534,4.65210355987055

Denise Richards looked like she was in the wrong movie, Pierce Brosnan is a very good James Bond. Much much better than Roger Moore, but in this movie he looks bored. Goldeneye was awsome, Tomorrow Never Dies was excellent. But this piece of garbage. Felt like it was rushed into production, and rushed through production.

Bond proves it a losing notion, the Not Enough business, so monopolists beware. The plot is intelligent, based on a twist or two of the Stockholm Syndrome that lingers for victims of extyended kidnappings. Shirley Manson and Garbage are memorable and perfect for the theme. The movie is especially timely, given extra scrutiny lately of crude oil and the fine Denise Richards. Sophie Marceau gets my vote as the hottest bad guy on film, and her portrayal to my mind is one of the best of the series.

It's all here in The World is Not Enough, as Bond attempts to find out why a rich businessman, a personal friend of M, was assassinated inside MI6 headquarters.  It leads him into a liaison with the man's bereaved daughter, but things are definitely not as they seem.

It begins with the usual innuendos. A beautiful woman accountant asks 007, ""Do you want to check my figures?"" Bond looks at her and replies, ""I am sure they are properly rounded."" There is the traditional opening long chase, this time after a beautiful girl, in boats, on water, under water, and on land, with the usual large number of destructions. The chase ends when the woman jumps from the boat on an air balloon with Bond hanging on as it ascends. She is about to blow herself and Bond up, when Bond promises her that he will protect her if she gives herself up, She replies that no one can protect her from ""him,"" and kills herself. Bond jumps to safety.

 Bond returns to find that a friend of M, a very rich man, is killed in her building, leaving a beautiful daughter, Elektra, who had been kidnapped by a man who one of the agents had shot in the head, but Elektra was now free. The man lived but lost all his senses, including feelings and pain. The daughter says she will continue her father's work of building an oil pipeline.

Released in 1999, the film was Brosnan's 3rd Bond film.  It is interesting that Brosnan started at the top with the terrific ""Goldeneye"" and worked his way downward with each suceeding film.  (While this film is not great, his next and last Bond film ""Die Another Day"" was far worse, an absolute mediocrity.)  This film does make you remember, despite all the Daniel Craig mania, just what a good Bond Brosnan was.  I read a recent interview with him where he is still unclear why the producers of the Bond films let him go, feeling he had at least 2 more Bonds left in him.  I absolutely agree that he had a couple more Bonds.  However he did have a habit of shooting his mouth off too much and advising who he would like to direct the next Bond film, people like like Quentin Tarantino.  Perhaps the producers felt he was too much trouble.  For whatever reason, he was let go but he was a good Bond.  (I really don't think that there has ever been a bad Bond, although Connery is still my favorite.)
""The World Is Not Enough"" has a relatively serious script that basically concerns Bond's attempts to protect a beautiful heiress attempting to build the world's longest oil pipeline.  The heiress is played by beautiful French actress Sophie Marceau, coming right after ""Braveheart.""  Her character is one of the more serious and interesting Bond female leads and she does do a good job of it.  The second female lead proably involves one of the silliest bits of miscasting in any Bond film: California bimbo-type Denise Richards as Dr. Christmas Jones, a NUCLEAR PHYSICIST!!!! (Yes, you heard right.)  This casting is silly but it did create some interest in the film.  (I can remember how excited my friends were after seeing her in ""Starship Troopers"" and ""Wild Things,"" feeling she was one of the hottest women in the world.  However she never really looks that great in this film, being dressed down most of the time.  She never really looks truly spectacular until the final scene.)  This film also features Robert Carlyle doing a fine job as the villain Reynaud, the great Robbie Coltrane reprising his role as the Russian gangster from ""Goldeneye"" and the wonderful Desmond Llewelyn in his final appearance as Q.)
The action scenes are okay at best (although they are a million times better than anything in the most recent Bond ""Quantum of Solace."")  The opening sequence is the longest in Bond history and features a motorboat chase down the Thames.  It is okay but still nowhere as enjoyable as the motorboat scene in ""Live and Let Die.""  There is a silly and unexciting segment of Bond and Electra (Marceau) on skis being attacked by some bizarre ""parahawks.""  (This whole scene makes no sense in the larger context of the film.)  The one really good action action scene is of Bond being attacked by helicoptors with hanging, whirling blades, normally used to cut off the tops of tress.  This is an exciting sequence and Brosnan does a lot of running, jumping and shooting.  The conclusion has Bond attempting to prevent a nuclear device from going off aboard a sunken Russian submarine and fighting the evil Carlyle, who is impervious to pain, at the same time.  It is fairly exciting, though nothing great by Bond standards.  The same could be said of this film: it is a pretty good movie.  However Bond films are in a class by themselves and this is simply not one of the greater ones.
The picture and sound on the blu-ray are great.  Among the extras are deleted scenes with on-screen introductions by the director, Michael Apted.  Theres a ""making of"" documentary with some bimbo who obviously knew very little about the Bond films interviewing the cast and director.  This was obviously made for tv and used for publicity around the time of the film's release. There is also a nice tribute to Desmond Llewelyn who made his final appearance as Q in the film.  Llewelyn was sadly killed in a car crash not long after the film was completed, although this was thought to be his last Bond film appearance at the time he made it and he does get a nice send-off in the film.",1272067200,,4230,4.651413189771198

1076742,1,6305784906,"If you loved the Sean Connery Bond movies, and the Roger Moore Bond movies, you'll be very disappointed with this one. The earlier Bond films, up to and including Licence to Kill, didn't just rely on special effects, explosions and lots of gunfire: they had plots, and they told a story clearly. (They also had attractive, sexy women.) Decay started with Goldeneye, perhaps because Albert Broccoli was no longer involved in production, and by the time we come to 'The World is Not Enough', the emphasis is clearly on explosions, flames, gunfire, and destruction. There is a story, which you can just about follow; but telling the story takes a back seat to filling the air with bullets, and surrounding Bond with the kind of flame-filled explosion popularized by the 1991 movie 'Backdraft'. Of course, in some of the earlier movies, Bond was occasionally near enough to explosions to be put out of action - he had some implausible escapes; but in 'The World is Not Enough' there is no attempt at realism. Every few minutes Bond walks, runs, or jumps out of explosions that would have reduced him to charred scraps.

Brosnan does his best, and he's a good actor, but good acting is wasted in a movie like this; he's literally outgunned; the real stars are the bangs, flames and gunfire. If that's what you like, you'll like this movie.

Bond's close encounters with the uniformly unattractive female characters aren't sexy, erotic, or romantic: they're just embarrassing. It's sad that a series that started with Ursula Andress and went on to Diana Rigg, Barbara Bach, Kristina Wayborn, etc should have come down to this level.",1265241600,2,1626,4.866425992779783

Brosnan has the ability to show Bond enjoying himself, while still bringing a more realistic performance to a very non-realistic film genre.  When Bond is getting choked to death in some Byzantine torture mechanism, Brosnan makes you feel Bond's pain (even if it is much less pain than a normal person would feel.) This movie is blessed and cursed with one of the best of the ""Bond girls"" and one of the worst.  The beautiful Sophie Marceau plays Bond's love interest in the movie, gorgeous and mysterious.  The beautiful Denise Richards plays Dr. Christmas Jones, a nuclear scientist, but the actress just is not up to the job.  The World is Not Enough wasn't the best Bond outing with Brosnan, but still one of the better of the series, and one I enjoy rewatching.",1252800000,3,939,4.730061349693251

Not one of the best Pierce Brosnan Bond movies. Especially with the goofy story line of the wacko Renard, who doesn't feel pain. And M, getting involved too closely in the operation, leading to her kidnapping.",1247961600,,566,4.66

1076863,3,6305784906,"I have been reading several negative reviews about this Bond episode and the only explanation I can give myself is that what so many people have hated is exactly what I have liked.

Admittedly this is not your usual Bond plot: there is plenty of action scenes, including the classical pursuit, this time Bond chasing a handsome sniper(ess) on the Thames; there is the usual plot to conquer/destroy the world, etc. but the general atmosphere is completely different, dark, gloomy, realistic.

That is my point, the plot is realistic: the villains' motives are perfectly clear and understandable from the point of view of general, globalised economy. In you put a decaying Russian empire with all its leaks of corruption, weapon trafficking, inefficient government. In you put the blatant inefficiency of the British (read Western) governments too.

Then we have two superb villains, both unquestionably evil: one, a splendid Sophie Marceau who becomes such out of a desperate sense of abandonment and revenge, the other, the terrorist, who surprises us by being capable of loving tenderly and fully.

There is no black and white here, just a murky gray that taints everything and I can very well see how this adult vision may have displeased many Bond fans.

Five stars cannot be given to this glorious attempt though: the script is faulty and there are some really cheesy lines including, unfortunately, the usual love banter between Bond and the Beauty at the end of the film. Direction is not flawless either: here and there the rhythm falters and is regained with an effort. Too bad.
Acting is not as bad though as stated by many. Brosnan is convincing and the Beauty does her job, served by the worst of lines, overshadowed by the gigantic figure of the beautiful Marceau.",1240704000,5,1776,4.946308724832215

1076945,2,6305784906,"If I had to rate this on the Bond showcased alone, it's a solid 5 star rating. We haven't had this solid of a Bond since Goldeneye (and yes I enjoyed Tomorrow Never Dies). But that's about it.

The way it is, this movie plays out like a parody of Film Noir with it's uber exaggerated plot. Sure Tomorrow Never Dies was a tad over-the-top in places, but it was enjoyable. Here, this film is just plain boring.

The film starts off strong with it's 15 minute long PTS. After a successful operation in Istanbul, A woman has terrorized the MI6 building and Bond successfully defeats her. Now if only the rest of the film were that strong... we then get into a ridiculous plot involving this girl Elektra King, an heiress to an oil company. Bond is assigned to protect her from a Superterrorist with a bullet lodged in his head. This leads Bond into a plot that is confusing, and incredibly hard to follow.

It's incredibly disappointing that a film like this turned out to be so over the top and ridiculous. If the plot were any slower it would be a snail. The slowness is what contributes to the disappointment factor, and the final showdown is LAAAAAME.

Overall it isn't entirely bad. It is beautifully shot and well located, but this movie is very mixed for ratings to me.",1239408000,2,1272,4.469827586206897

Brosnan is a great Bond in my opinion and by this movie has molded into the persona. It's also the last movie Desmond Llewelyn played Q, his 17th I think. Anyways overall it has a good plot, a great villian, and a lot of good action. So if you want a good movie to watch on a friday night this is not a bad choice.

Oh and I didn't forget, the Blu Ray picture looks fantastic and the audio is top notch. ""Making of"" very disappointing though.",1238112000,,672,4.25

1077024,4,6305784906,"After the disappointment of Tomorrow Never Days, it perhaps shouldn't have been too surprising that, as per the usual EON pattern of alternating good and bad Bond films, The World is Not Enough turned out rather well. It helps that it has a stronger plot this time round as well as some attempt at an element of mystery - along with For Your Eyes Only this is the only Bond where the identity of the real villain is withheld for the first half of the movie. It's also more character-based than usual, with some interesting dialogue that takes on a different dimension once you know who's on the side of the angels and who isn't. The Maguffin is an oil-based variation on Goldfinger's big scheme, but the execution is very different and rather more grounded. Brosnan has the best character writing of his tenure but isn't always up to it: the moments of ruthlessness convince but he's one of those actors who can't stand still and just be and always has to do something, making him seem somewhat ADDS in some scenes and leads to a couple of strange bits of gurning. Yet it can still lay claim to being his best performance in the role, and the presence of Sophie Marceau and Robert Carlyle helps raise the acting bar enough so that even Denise Richards' hot pant wearing nuclear scientist - in-joke casting at its finest - isn't quite as bad as she's been painted.

There's a slightly schizoid feel to Michael Apted's direction at times seeming a tad uncertain and stylistically very different from Vic Armstrong's action scenes. It's certainly not difficult to tell who shot what, and not just because Armstrong seems better at hiding the significant height difference between Brosnan and Carlyle. While still variable (the opening boat chase has a few too many sight gags and the helicopter/chainsaw sequence doesn't work as well as it should), the action scenes are much better handled this time round and much better integrated into the story. Despite some awful wisecracks, this feels less like an attempt to hang plenty of setpieces on a flimsy plot and more like the action is being dictated by the story. Definitely one of the better modern Bond outings.

There's not much new in the two-disc Ultimate Edition to justify an upgrade though. While the extras from the previous release have been carried over, there's only a Hong Kong press conference and a few deleted and alternate scenes. Of these - including Renard's very unimpressive original entrance, more tomfoolery in Q's lab and a line about madmen in hollowed out volcanoes filled with large breasted women threatening the world with nuclear war (""It only takes one"") among them - only a visually striking scene in the abandoned oilfields seems good enough to have kept.",1202860800,,2736,4.806794055201698

1077026,3,6305784906,"And there is no point in watching this movie unless you are a serious Bond fan who wants to keep up with every film.  The World Is Not Enough has two great things going for it, and thats the extent I got out of this film.  Its not a bad movie, its just not up to par with the other so many great Bond films out there.  The pre-credits scene is the best pre-credits action scene ever in a Bond film - and its the best part of this movie.  The other great thing is the character Elektra King.  Her chemistry with Bond and her own secrecy was quite mysterious.

It's sad when I am waiting for the ending of a Bond movie to come.  Some parts of the movie were very good, and then there are others that just made me feel like ugh.  The story was never interesting, as much as I tried to get into it.  I won't say it was the easiest thing to follow either.  I was captivated, however, by any events surrounding Elektra.  She fooled Bond for quite some time - and me too, believing she was an innocent woman.  Though she really isn't the main villain in this film, her character was strong enough to hold the role.  The main villain, Renard,  was a big dissapointment.  He had the ability to be a very original villain, being shot in the head once and escaping death.  The result - he cannot feel anything, including any pain.  One would think such a villain would destroy his enemies in the fight scenes.  One would think.  The final fight between Renard and Bond felt very weak, despite the creativity that they are fighting in a submarine that has fliped vertically.

The action was actually limited in this film too.  The action scenes that are presented, felt rather dull.  Though there is some originality with the copters that have hanging blades and saws from their base, cutting everything in sight, that was about the only interesting scene of action.  As mentioned earlier, its the pre-credits scene that steals the show.  It is the most amazing boat chase, involving the Q boat piloted by Bond, who ends up taking shortcuts through the streets and buildings in London, before landing back on the water.

Pierce Brosnan actually did pretty good in this film, maybe a bit better than his previous two films.  The role of Bond seems to now fit him well, and he has found a comfortable level of flow.  Aside from Elektra, the rest of the characters were rather dull.  Again, the villain Renard is easily forgettable, and Denise Richards as Christmas Jones was embarrassing - specifically, she just can't act.  Most Bond villains have decent henchmen, but not here.  The closest we get is a guy named Bull, who is all show and no action.

Ok movie overall, but one of the most uninteresting Bond films ever.  One of the best female charcaters and a great pre-credits action scene are the higlights.  Die hard fans will still find enough to appreciate it, but for those who are comfortable with films like ""Goldfinger"" and ""Spy Who Loved Me"", this just can't compare.

The action scenes, the story, the acting, and the score are all just perfect.  This has the most action of any other Bond film yet.  Its packed and feels like it would never stop.  Those scenes of action are done well and look very good.  I loved the twists and turns with the story and the chemistry between Bond and Elektra.  It keeps the film more dramatic and less like just another Bond film.  Pierce was very comfortable in the role by this time.  This is his best work as James Bond.  Like noted, the music in the film is also top notch.  David Arnolds best work as well.  The title song by Garbage is my favorite title song in a 007 film yet.  Like I said, I have a soft spot for this one.  There is so much I love about it and very little I dont.  In many ways its an underrated film, but I do see it get credit a lot.  It deserves it.  A great James Bond 007 film.",1181174400,2,1043,3.8904761904761904
1077030,4,6305784906,"Pierce Brosnan returned in 1999 for his third appearance as James Bond in the 19th official Bond film.  Brosnan was excellent as Bond in ""Tomorrow Never Dies,"" and he was pretty good in this movie, but it seemed to me that churning out three movies in less than six years was causing a little fraying around the edges.  This movie is just not as good as ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" and perhaps not even as good as ""Goldeneye.""

This Bond film begins just as Bond films always do, with Bond attempting to save someone.  This time he has become involved in trying to rescue Elektra King (the stunningly beautiful Sophie Marceau).  While Bond does not rescue Elektra (who soon after frees herself), Bond does recover the ransom money.  It probably would have been better if Bond had not rescued the ransom money because it makes a big hole in MI-6's headquarters.  An assassin nearly kills Bond, who then goes chasing the assassin about in Q's nicely appointed fishing boat.  When I say nicely appointed, I mean rocket boost, torpedoes, a submarine mode, and a computer that has a cool mapping feature.

Once Bond stops chasing the assassin he learns that Elektra King is being threatened by a terrorist, along with her family's oil pipeline.  At least, that is what appears to be the situation.  Bond soon encounters danger as he tries to protect Elektra from terrorists.  Bond encounters even more danger when he discovers that the terrorists plan to steal a nuclear weapon from Russia.  While in Russia, Bond meets Christmas Jones (played by Denise Richards - their meeting generates one of the best jokes in the movie).  The nuclear bomb soon shows up in the King pipeline.  But wait, there's more!  Some of the nuclear material is missing from the bomb (I will let the viewer discover how Bond learns that little tidbit).  Bond is forced to learn what happened to the remaining nuclear material.  During Bond's search for the remaining material he encounters one of the most nefarious weapons yet seen in a Bond film, a helicopter with a series of cutting blades that is supposed to be used for trimming trees.

The plot thickens and builds until a final encounter with terrorist Renard (Robert Carlyle) aboard a Russian submarine that is well on its way to going kaboom, which will ultimately contaminate a goodly portion of the Mediterranean.

This special edition two disk DVD includes a wealth of extras, a couple of audio tracks, multiple features and documentaries.  The audio commentary by Michael Apted was somewhat lackluster, but the audio commentary by Peter Lamont (production designer), Vic Armstrong (second unit director) and David Arnold (composer) was good.

This Bond movie is not one of my favorites.  While there are portions that I think are outstanding (specifically, the opening boat chase, the chase scene in the mountains, the helicopters with the tree trimming blades, and the scenes involving Q and John Cleese as R), this movie seems to have much less creativity overall than the previous few Bond movies.  I am unable to fault Pierce Brosnan, who does very well.  Perhaps after churning out two Bond movies in the previous four years the level of creativity was running low.  I have to balance my comments a little by the six awards this movie won and the eight awards this movie was nominated for.  However, one award and one nomination were for Razzie awards for Worst Supporting Actress (Denise Richards, who won) and Worst Screen Couple (Brosnan and Richards, but no winner this time).

In spite of the weakness of this movie, it did well in the box office, setting a new record for the opening weekend of a Bond film, and grossing more than any previous Bond movie.  The main reason is that there is no such thing as a bad Bond film.  There may be weak Bond films, but they are all watchable.  The only question is how often you would like to watch them again.

This film does mark the passing of an era.  Desmond Llewelyn passed away shortly after this film was released in the United States.  We will forever miss Desmond and his explanations of his gadgets.  While it is said that anyone can be replaced, the question that is usually not asked is how well they can be replaced.  There was only one Desmond Llewelyn and while someone may take his function in the movies, they will not replace Desmond in our hearts.

I have this Bond film because it is a Bond film.  Admittedly weaker than average, it remains one of the series and I have watched this one several times, and I will watch it again.  Sometimes having all the movies in a series is more important than just having the best.

1077031,2,6305784906,"I'm a fan of both the novels by Ian Fleming and the movies, and have been for decades.  This movie in my opinion ranks 21st out of 21.  It is just bad.  The writers/producers by this time had finally run out of Fleming's stories and the other scraps of his works they'd managed to scrape together to form other movies, and the ideas they did come up with are not thrilling, not funny, not believable, and not good.  It's as though they knew that the movie would bring in the money (which it did), and therefore no one really had to try at all.  Especially Brosnan.  He clearly makes that assumption, along with his added assumption that HE is why the movie will make money.  Maybe he was partly right, but it's sad.

Good luck thinking of Denise Richards as having a doctorate in nuclear physics and being fluent in Russian without laughing yourself to tears.  She can barely speak the lines, so she makes it hard to believe she can read, let alone any of the rest.  There are many beautiful actresses who could have pulled this off, but Richards was apparently flavor of the month, or cheaper than the rest, or something.

Robert Carlyle has been good in other movies I have seen.  He gets a break as a ""Bond villain,"" and turns in a very poor performance.  Performance?  No, if someone shows up, stands where they are told, speaks when they are told and wears the costume they're given, I suppose you can say they ""appear"" in the movie.  ""Performing"" means being more than a cardboard cut-out.  I suppose an ""appearance"" was cheaper too.

If you are familiar at all with the rest of the Bond movies, particularly the good ones, or any good movie at all for that matter, you will find this one completely sub-par, and somewhat insulting to your intelligence and good taste.",1170547200,3,1774,4.5109717868338555
1077110,5,6305784906,"Occasionally in an action film series, one of its entries attempts to deal with the persona of its hero with equal intensity as it handles its central storyline. Such is the case with THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH. Director Michael Apted attempted to show James Bond's obsession for a woman, Sophie Marceau, for whom he had become intrigued with. Mishandled and mistreated by British Intelligence, Bond becomes enamored with her plight and tries to rectify it out of his attraction for her. Unfortunately this idea never came satisfactorily across upon this film's initial release. The change of pace to the Bond formula and Brosnan's desire to expand the depth of the James Bond character never seemed to come to fruition at the time. Somehow I think some of the action elements essential to this plotline got in the way. For instance, the opening sequence in Patrick Malahide's office demonstrates Bonds skills instantly take control a situation and an intensity to avenge the fate of a fellow operative. This is a great action scene and his driven emotional energy. In contradiction, the pipeline scene with Brosnan and Denise Richards is perfunctory and mundane and does not advance any of the complexities of Bond's character or plot of the film for that matter. Reexamining the film, I also see a complex relation between villain Robert Carlyle and Sophie Marceau and even Judi Dench as M and Sophie Marceau. This film abounds with complexities that were somehow overshadowed by the hype that surrounded it. It is another good Bond film. All that being said, Pierce Brosnan really has the part of James Bond down to an art and science in a rather ethereal fashion.",1167955200,5,1664,4.925266903914591
1077111,4,6305784906,"Pierce Brosnan is back and has to save the world from a mad man once again. Robert Carlyle is really good as that mad man and is one of the best Bond villians in my book. You also have Sophie Marceau and Denise Richards as two sexy Bond girls. Most Bond fans just mostly picked on the film due to Denise Richards acting abilities. Which are limited. I never had much of a problem with her, I guess I was too busy looking at her and not watching her acting abilities as closely as other Bond fans lol.

  I do think Brosnan's Bond films did try too hard in casting Bond women though. I mean most of them were too recognizeabke and just casted on looks basically. I think Goldeneye had the best casting though of any of his films. I mean I don't even know what else that Bond girl was in after Goldeneye or before it for that matter and she could act too. I do like the casting of Sophie Marceau here more than the Denise Richards casting though. Not only because she's a better actor but because she doesn't stick out like a sore thumb. I mean I just know her from a bad David Spade film.

  Anyway I think The World is Not Enough is one of Brosnan's better outings as Bond. It's surely better than Tomorrow Never Dies. Plus I think Robert Carlyle is as memorable as a Bond villian as Sean Bean in GoldenEye. I don't know why people talk about the villian in Die Another Day like he was the best of the Brosnan films, he did nothing for me really.  Brosnan doesn't shine here as much as he does in GoldenEye but I do find his line at the end both crude and funny and he delivers it well. Denise Richards' name is Christmas and he says somthing like ""Christmas doesn't come once a year""....lol.",1164412800,4,1692,4.203703703703703

Denise was not glamorous or smart as past Bond girls, essentially if she were left out of the story no one would have noticed. She looked like some chick Bond picked up from the mall, denim jacket included, who just provided unnecessary commentary. The story was disjointed and hopes that it would go anywhere and went no where. M is kidnapped, yeah, that had nothing nor any relevance to the story. This movie seemed rushed to produce and you can tell.",1163721600,4,565,4.603960396039604
1077113,3,6305784906,"Bond films seem very critic proof since they're not meant to move you to tears and they're not meant to be laugh riots or creep into your skin. They're action movies pure and simple and arguably no one does it better. But seeing as how we're already on Bond 19 and while it's not that the series has completely run out of ideas, there is a sameness and familiarity to it all that prevents it from being the best Bond it can be. Doesn't mean that the filmmakers don't try really hard though.

After the killing of oil tycoon Robert King, 007 James Bond is hired to protect his daughter, beautiful Elektra. The main villain orchestrating everything is Renard, a man who was shot in the head and affecting his brain so that he can't actually feel pain, although the bullet will eventually kill him. Bond has to team with nuclear physicist Christmas Jones (Bond girls have had pretty strange names but this is just stupid) in order to avert a world-threatening plan (natch).

First, the casting: Sophie Marceau personally is my choice for the hottest Bond girl but acting-wise it's very extreme from one end to the next without any in-betweens. And Denise Richards is arguably the biggest miscast I've seen in a film. As for Pierce Brosnan, well this is #3 for him so he's still as suave and Bond-esque with the action hero coming into play whenever he needs to. As for the villain, Robert Carlyle is one of those Bond baddies where the premise is there but he's just not as compelling, in fact he seems kind of wimpy.

The Bond series lately has been going for that bigger is badder approach but there's a couple of goodies: the opening with a big boat chase is one of my favorite openers in the series but then we have a kind of meh ski escape as well as Bond versus a helicopter with sawblades attached which is as exciting as it is preposterous. But that's what's expected with any Bond film so I don't even mind anymore but there's almost a too over-the-topness to it as if the films tried to eclipse Bond wannabe films of late.

Is it the best Bond? No. The best Brosnan film? No. But it's a solid if very faulty Bond. I'd recommend it anyway though.",1163376000,3,2152,4.4543147208121825
1077114,5,6305784906,"This is a pretty exciting movie. I have to say Pierce Bronsan makes the best James Bond, even better than Sean Connery in older James Bond movies. Some of the top action scenes include the Boat Chase, James Bond and Electra King(a very beautiful woman) getting chased while skiing and the helicopter scene. The basic story is that James Bond is sent to protect an oil heiress, whom unknown forces are trying to kill.

Bond thinks it is because they don't want competition from her Oil pipeline. However, the story takes a surprise twist that most won't see coming. For that reason I give this movie 5 stars; for this unusual twist that is not there in other Bond movies.",1148947200,2,670,4.583333333333333

Returning: Judi Dench as ""M"", Samantha Bond as ""Miss Moneypenny"", Desmond Llewellyn as ""Q"", Colin Salmon as ""Charles Robinson"", Michael Kitchen as ""Tanner"" and Robbie Coltrane returns as ""Valentin Zukovsky"".  Michael G. Wilson plays a man in the casino.
  At the MI6 Headquarters in London, England, an old friend of ""M"" (Judi Dench), Sir Robert King (David Calder) who she used to study law with, is building a new pipeline and believes terrorists may be trying to destroy it.  When Mr. King leaves, Bond sits down to have a cordial drink with ""M"". After the ice in his drink begins to fizz, he notices it has been poisoned. Bond suddenly gets the notion to run to the safe to stop Mr. King.  As King gets near the billetes of money, the special pin on King's lapel sets off a bomb in the money.  It kills Robert King instantly.
  Later at the funeral, Bond is briefed about Robert King's daughter, Elektra (Sophie Marceau).  When the MI6 returns to the Headquarters in Scotland, Bond is briefed on his next mission.  ""M"" had sent an agent to kill Renard (Robert Carlyle) who is a terrorist.  The agent shot him in the head, but Renard still lives with the bullet still inside.  The bullet is moving and killing his senses.  He feels no pain.  Eventually the bullet will kill him.  Renard gets stronger everyday and Bond must find him.  Bond will have some help by Christmas Jones (Denise Richards), but the plot thickens when Bond realizes Elektra isn't as innocent as everyone thinks and ""M"" is kidnapped and held  hostage.
  After 36 years of playing ""Q"" (1963-1999), Desmond Llewelyn makes his exit after introducing ""R"" (John Cleese), his new assistant.

1077117,1,6305784906,"The 19th Bond film is one of the most pathetic. James Bond is a emotional wimp, M is a stupid grandmother, and the so called ""world's dangerous terrorist"" with the banal alias of ""Renard"" acts like a school boy with a crush. This appearantly is all the doing of one silly little girl named Elektra King who wants to regain control of her family's oil company and is obessed with letting the world know. King is appearantly is so evil she can make everyone turn into third rate soap opera stars gushing over their emotions instead of thinking logically. This film makes everything so personal to the point of being a joke. Everyone has something whine about or some regret. The World is Not Enough is far removed from Ian Fleming's books which were targeted for warm-blooded metrosexuals. Yes folks, Bond is a 90's man and he's not afraid to cry.

The action scenes are dull and sometimes badly executed and the plot is far too convoluted even for a Bond film. I will admit this film is actually pretty stylish in terms of clothes and set decor but the dreary cinematography hampers the film's image quite a bit. I would say the last major insult was the return of Goldeneye's Valentin Zukovsky who is now just a comical fop as opposed to be a ruthless Russian gangster with a sense of humor. No, they had throw in Denise Richards as a nuclear physicist. Not even Ed Wood could have bought something that stupid.

1077118,5,6305784906,"In 1999, a year that saw big budget special effects extravaganzas such as, ""The Matrix"" and ""Star Wars - Episode 1:  The Phantom Menace"", MGM really had their work cut out for them in bringing the 19th film in the `James Bond' franchise to theaters.  It would have been a simple decision for some movie studios to push back the release of any movie that was expected to do well, in order to get away from the stiff competition so that their movie would have the chance it deserves.  But MGM believed in the `James Bond' franchise so much, that even though it's had sequel after sequel after sequel, and audiences should, by all rights, be completely tired of the character, MGM knew that their latest effort ""007:  The World Is Not Enough"" (quite the mouthful isn't it) was such a solid movie that even going up against such huge blockbusters wouldn't be enough to dent their profit from this franchise.

""007:  The World Is Not Enough"" starts off with Agent 007, James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) being given the assignment of protecting a very beautiful and seductive oil heiress (Sophie Marceau).  This assignment, as simple as it seems, proves to be rather troublesome for 007, for one this heiress is a close personal friend of M's (Judi Dench), and she possesses a passion for life and love that rivals James Bond's.  To make matters increasingly worse, the reason the heiress needs protection is because of an eco-terrorist known as Renard (Robert Carlyle), who due to a bullet lodged in his brain makes him impervious to any pain, and virtually unstoppable as an enemy.  In his quest to stop Renard, James encounters a lovely, young scientist (Denise Richards) who, unbeknownst to her, just so happens to be working for Renard and his evil cause.  So, it's up to Bond to not only thwart Renard's nefarious schemes, but also protect the young scientist and the heiress.  To some this might seem daunting, to James Bond it's just another day at MI-6.

Proving that even after 19 films and 5 different actors playing the title role, this franchise is still in top-form, somehow managing to come back time and time again with fresh, new ideas that continue to thrill audiences.  Pierce Brosnan returning to the role of James Bond for a third time, turns in his strongest performance to date, his range from Bond's love for the ladies to his ruthlessness with the villains is remarkably played by Brosnan.  Robert Carlyle delivers a very sinister, yet somewhat low-key performance as the villainous Renard.  Sophie Marceau and Denise Richards not only vie for the affection of James Bond, but also for the coveted role of favorite Bond girl featured in this movie.  Most Bond films only feature one clear cut Bond girl, but with this film it's evident that one would not suffice, and both win the coveted title in my opinion.  The action scenes are even more fun and elaborate, especially the obligatory jaw-dropping opener that always manages to deliver some new, over-the-top obstacle for Bond to overcome.  If I had one complaint about this movie at all, it would have to be the choice to have the band `Garbage' perform the title song, I am not a fan of `Garbage', and truthfully I believe their name says everything there is to say about their music.  They are definitely a poor choice for the title song in this franchise.

With 19 films under his belt, James Bond is still going strong, and this newest installment is definitely one of the strongest in the series.  A definite must own!

1077217,4,6305784906,"This was the 19th James Bond film, and the third one starring Pierce Brosnan. When an oil tycoon is killed inside MI-6, Bond must protect his daughter and thwart a complex plot to contaminate the world's oil supply.

Even though the story has become somewhat more relevant in today's political climate, at times it simply lacks the energy and urgency of other Bond adventures. The stakes are high enough, but the movie never presents them with enough gusto to rise above the typical Bond formula. You get the requisite mixture of dialogue and action sequences, and some elements that are potentially interesting (such as Bond's shoulder injury and M's larger role) aren't expanded on in a satisfying fashion. Renard is a villain with a great gimmick in the vein of Jaws and Oddjob, yet he ends up underdeveloped. The film gives us one of the best Bond girls (Sophie Marceau) along with one of the worst (Denise Richards). It also features the last appearance of Desmond Llewelyn as Q, who passed away shortly after the film premiered.

This dvd isn't as loaded as the older Bond films. You get two audio commentaries, a short, superficial making-of documentary, and one of those ""extended-viewing"" modes where clicking on an icon during the film will bring up some behind-the-scenes footage. There's also the cool music video from Garbage. It's a decent collection of goodies, just not enough (no pun intended). None of the Brosnan Bond movies can be called bad, and The World is Not Enough definitely tops some of the franchise's past efforts. It just lacks a certain spark and feels too formulaic at times to become classic.",1125100800,3,1626,4.88768115942029

The villians I question and it brings us back to better writers and sticking with the formula.  Bond is trying to be too dramatical and Brosnan is getting older and grayer and sleeping with women in their 20s.  The bond girls are cool, not a big fan of Denise Richards.  Action is excellent but less drama.",1124928000,2,413,4.453333333333333

So ... no ... go rewatch 'Goldeneye' because 'The World Is Not Enough's not really that great.  What makes this work notable (or in my mind, infamous),  is maybe the biggest casting mistake in the last twenty-five years.

Denise Richards plays a bilingual nuclear physicist.

Yes ... THAT Denise Richards.  Yes, you heard me right ... a bilingual nuclear physicist.  I would say that it has to be seen to be believed, but I just couldn't make myself buy into it.  THE CHICK FROM 'WILD THINGS' IS PLAYING A BILINGUAL NUCLEAR PHYSICIST!!!  I honestly think I could have delt better if I took the cast of 'Baywatch' and put each of them in all the supporting roles.

Obviously I'm not going to recommend buying a copy of this DVD.  However, if you know anyone that has one, borrow it and keep your finger on the 'chapter skip' button.  It's HYSTERICAL watching Richards fumble around with all the bigger words ...",1115424000,3,1151,4.578431372549019
1077221,2,6305784906,"I think Pierce Brosnan has had the most impressive debut as James Bond (in 1995's GOLDENEYE) since Sean Connery first invented the role in 1962.

(George Lazeby only got one shot, Roger Moore didn't taylor the role to himself until his third outing, and Timothy Dalton's lack of humor never allowed him to fit as 007).

But since GOLDENEYE, the producers of the Bond films have really squandered what a great actor they have for the role by jumping into lifeless scripts and listless direction.  The action scenes have no momentum, the storylines feel like retreads without the witty, apocalyptic urgency of the early films, and everything just feels rushed.

Robert Carlysle is a great villain but he's pretty much by the numbers for the second half.  Nothing is made of the irony that Bond is a hero who cannot connect with feelings and Carlysle is a villain who can't physically feel anything.

(Why couldn't Carlysle, lying at the bottom in the climax, laugh loudly at Bond and defiantly yell, ""Hey, Bond...Didn't hurt!"").

This entry also has the most cringe-worthy line of all the Bond films: ""Who says Christmas only comes once a year?""

Oh, how the mighty have fallen.",1101427200,5,1176,4.845
1077222,4,6305784906,"I really love this Bond.

Granted, every Bond is basically stupid--fun, but stupid.

(That's why I can't give any of them 5 stars.)

But this one has two brilliant high spots: the two polar women, Sophie Marceau and Denise Richards.

Sophie can act, so it does come as a surprise that she's the Bad Girl.

Denise can't, so it is WONDERFUL when (sticking out her chest like two nosecones) she announces that she's a NUCLEAR PHYSICIST!!!!!!

This is brilliant.  Like casting Arnold Schwarzenegger as Einstein or Keanu Reeves as Hamlet.

This alone would make the movie worthwhile.",1100476800,,578,4.88659793814433
1077328,4,6305784906,"and, as Bond films go, this one is pretty good.  Pierce Brosnan really captures both the dark, brutal James Bond of the books and the suave, stylish Bond of the movies and weaves them together into a believable whole.

It's too bad the producers are still scientifically illiterate.  Every time I saw people handling unshielded ""weapons-grade"" plutonium or calling it ""safe"" I wanted to scream.  Really, five minutes of internet research would have told Broccoli et. al. that this is complete bulls***!  It wouldn't have detracted from the movie to inject just that little bit of realism.

Other than that, the action scenes were excellent and well scripted, and the plot is deeper than in most of the other films.  A very entertaining film.  I'd give it five stars, but the BS factor is just a bit too high for me.",1093046400,2,815,4.7304964539007095
1077329,5,6305784906,"This is the best film to date in the series, hands-down. It may not have the classic charm of Goldfinger, but a couple of viewings (something most people aren't willing to credit a Bond film with) reveal a film which is incredibly substantial, in an unprecedented - and unnecesary - way. It could get by on the charm of the locations, one-liners etc., but it still tries to put together a credible and interesting plot, and it succeeds.
The most obvious credit to the writers is Carlyle's brooding, existentialist villain, which reminded me of The Misfit in O'Connor's 'A Good Man is Hard to Find.' Carlyle, in surprising contrast to his turn as the psychotic Begbie in Trainspotting, plays the role with just enough subtley and understatement, making the character's evil much more believable than the cackling megalomania of earlier specimens. What I also like about the screenplay, though, and what isn't immediatley apparent, is that it casts some doubt on the role of Bond in the world. In other movies, he seems to have an absolute moral imperative, able to gun down scores of people without any consequence, simply because his enemies are abosolutley evil. In this film, though, among the ruins of the USSR (a theme already explored in Goldeneye), there's more gray than black and white, and the circumstances don't allow him to get off so blamelessly; ultimately he has to do something which he might might regret. It's far from making him human - if that were to happen, it would undermine the whole promise of the series - but it's an interesting take. Then there's the way the plot works in minor characters, like Judi Dench's M and the Russian gangster Zukovsky, both of whom provide a usually self-reliant Bond with indispensable help, while Zukovsky experiences the closest thing to character _development_ which anyone has probably ever experienced in a Bond film. As for Richards, I don't know what she's doing there, either, and probably it would have been a stronger movie without her, but at least she's hot.",1087862400,,2027,4.895348837209302
1077330,5,6305784906,"THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH (known to Bond fans as TWINE) may be Pierce Brosnan's finest outing as Bond to date. A more complex and nuanced story than most recent Bond films, TWINE recaptures a good part of the exotica and international intrigue of the Bond series as first conceived.
The precredits sequence sets up the story nicely: Sir Robert King, oil magnate and friend of ""M"" (Judi Dench) is killed by booby trapped money delivered to him by Bond. All roads lead to Rome, the roads being clues, and Rome in this case being represented by Electra King (Sophie Marceau), Sir Robert's beautiful daughter, who was the victim of a recent kidnap plot hatched by the mysterious Renard, a terrorist rendered unable to experience pain by a bullet lodged in his skull.  ""M"" dispatches Bond to protect Electra, who has taken over her father's petroleum empire in central Asia.
From the moment he arrives in Azerbaijan, Bond is a hunted man. Although first enamored of Electra, Bond soon realizes that there is something amiss.
In TWINE, Brosnan resurrects the dark Bond of FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE. His dual nemeses, Electra and Renard, are ably played by Marceau and Robert Carlyle, who both bring some surprising depth to their characters. Electra is particularly sympathetic, being both the brainwashed victim and willing accomplice of Renard. She is by turns sexual and ingenuous, vulnerable and implacable. Marceau is breathtakingly beautiful.
Carlyle's Renard, trapped in a body that can't feel, exudes both pathos and hatred as he plots the destruction of the democracies.
Dench's ""M"" plays a central role in the film, far larger than any ""M"" before her. The film is notable for being the last appearance as Desmond Llwellyn as ""Q"". Llewellyn, who played ""Q"" in almost every Bond film after 1964, died in a car wreck just days before the theatrical release of the picture, and John Cleese was cleverly edited into the film as his replacement, ""R"".
Denise Richards has the weakest major role, playing Dr. Christmas Jones, a nuclear physicist. Richards could have been left on the cutting room floor in her entirety. More's the pity, because Richards is a strikingly beautiful woman who is entirely upstaged by the exotic, erotic Marceau. Besides being a rather miscast improbable genius in cargo shorts and a tank top, Richards' character has even more of an ""afterthought"" feel than ""R"" does, as if the producers just couldn't tolerate the idea of the film ending with an unredeemed Electra King and no virtuous love interest for Bond.
Two hours and some of intelligent action-adventure, THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH fulfills all expectations.",1086048000,3,2633,4.984090909090909
1077331,4,6305784906,"The Amazon reviewer noted that JB was becoming formulaic...well, in a sense, every movie is formulaic:  Mysteries, science fiction, light romances, even drama.  What was good about this were the terrific special effects, the complex, modern plot (The USSR is no more) and the music.  Bad things:  Alas, romance.  The lead could not compete with earlier Bond women and being neither a femme fatale or a blushing virgin we are caught in the middle.  Brosnan was good in this role, a more serious JB that brought much-needed weight and content to the part.",1085875200,,553,4.89247311827957
1077332,4,6305784906,"For me, this was one of those films where first impressions weren't exactly the best ones as when this film was released there was a great deal of hype about it and I certainly remember being excited about it but the reality of it at the theater didn't ring true.  My opinion of its theatrical release had even been so poor as to not even purchase the DVD when it was released.  A recently rekindled interest in the Bond films brought me to the decision to give this film one more chance which also leads one to the market place sellers as the DVD is no longer in production unless you wish to buy one of the entire boxed sets to get this film.
Upon viewing ""The World is Not Enough"" the second time I would definitely have to say that I was overly critical of its theatrical release.  Taken as a whole, this third Bond film with Pierce Brosnan as James Bond is a pretty good film.  The basic premise is a bit weaker than the other three Bond films starring Brosnan but of course, the films producers overcome that with some spectacular action sequences and scenery.
Performance wise, Pierce Brosnan does Bond extraordinarily well in this, his third appearance.  At this point in time, who else could play Bond, probably nobody as he's made the part entirely his and we, the fans, are the better for it.  One of the greatest treats in this Bond film, as with all Bond films is some new Bond babes and as even more special treat this film stars the extraordinarily beautiful French actress Sophie Marceau who may be best known by American audiences for her role in ""Braveheart.""  Her performance for this film is pretty much perfect to the role, which is ""over the top,"" as she takes her character from one end of the extreme to the other.  We're also treated to Denise Richards as a Bond babe in this film and she does a great job with her role although it isn't as quite as over the top as one would expect of her based on previous roles she's taken.
""The World is Not Enough"" is also quite unfortunately the last appearance by Desmond Llewelyn in role of Q prior to his passing.  ""Die Another Day"" just didn't seem right without his appearance in the film.  As the ""show must go on,"" the producers brought in his replacement in John Cleese of ""Monty Python"" fame in the role of R which is Q's assistant and his character is different but an acceptable replacement.
Director Michael Apted does a very good job with this film considering the script.  He may be best known for films such as ""Nell"" and ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" but his contribution to Bond series is a respectable one.
The Premise:
Our erstwhile hero finds himself once again amidst a series of plot twists and action sequences as he's been assigned to protect Elektra King (Sophie Marceau) and at the same time discovers a post cold war disaster involving Russian equipment to include tactical nuclear weapons, all along the way in attempting to find Renard (Robert Carlyle) who was supposed to have been eliminated by another ""00"" agent but that agent only succeeded in making a stronger monster.  What follows from there is a fairly decent Bond film that covers a majority of the spectrum that is normally covered in a Bond film as we find Pierce Brosnan's version of Bond becoming a bit darker and harsher...  {ssintrepid}

1077333,4,6305784906,I think Brosnon is one of the best Bond's ever. He is what I envision when I think of what Bond should look like.

1077334,1,6305784906,"There have been a lot of ups and downs in the storied Bond series, which is to be expected with so many different installments being made.  That being said, this is definitley one of the valleys, right down there with Licence to Kill and Moonraker.  The plot is terrible, Richards is much better on mute and Brosnan doesn't appear to be given anything to work with.  Just because you can assemble a few attractive women, some tech. toys and a madman doesn't mean that you have a Bond film.  While Brosnan's reign started strong with Goldeneye and only dipped a bit with Tomorrow Never Dies, it hit the toilet with this one.  The best Bonds are more than simply an action film- it needs to be a moviegoing experience.  Sadly the only experience this leaves the viewer with is the urge to turn the tv off.",1075507200,,803,4.465753424657534

Beginning with a slam bang action sequence (one of the best in the series) the film goes downhill from there as the plot gets more and more formulatic, even for James Bond standards.  There are a few plot twists and turns that make for wholesome surprises, but in the end The World is Not Enough is one of the most disappointing films in the long running series.  Robert Carlyle's (Trainspotting, Ravenous) Renard, a villian who is impervious to pain, is a nice touch, as is the beautiful Sophie Marceau (Braveheart) as the treacherous Elektra King, but the casting of Denise Richards as a nuclear physiscist (yes, you read that right) is one of many low points of the film (even though she looks severely hot in her short shorts and tight tank top ensemble).

Denise Richards is AWFUL as well as pretty much everybody else in this movie except Elektra King(Marceau)who is one of the best Bond girls since the 80's.  I do not understand why we had to go from Timothy Dalton to Pierce Brosnan.  I mean Pierce was good in the Lawnmower Man, but he just is not heading Bond in the right direction.  When Dalton took the reigns from Roger Moore, there was a refreshing little bit of originality and seriousness.  MGM cares more about money and box office popularity then they do about doing the GREAT IAN FLEMING'S original character justice.",1071532800,3,868,4.561290322580645
1077337,2,6305784906,"Yet once more 007 toys with the gadgets and girls--and saves the world when nobody else can. >yawn< The greatest flaw in THIS Bond film is the way the screenwriters have tried to add ""psychological complexity"" to the villains. The result is that many intelligent viewers will have mixed feeling about their deaths at the hands of Bond. The male villain is given a heart (not of gold, but perhaps of silver) and has good motives for hating the British government. The female villain (the ever-adorable Sophie Marceau) is likewise given pretty good reasons to hate these people. Bond, as usual, is given the personal morality of a stray dog, but what makes him most disagreeable in THIS outing is the way the writers have him gratuitously gun down the e-a Mlle Marceau--who is both insane AND unarmed at the time! Ever hear of shooting to wound, Mr. Bond? Or just grabbing the phone from her hand? Roger Ebert thought this Bond film had a better plot than is usually the case, but I am convinced, given the ""needs"" of the plot to make the audience ""care"" about who wins and loses (even on a comedy-adventure level), that there is a fatal flaw in the design. THIS film, contrary to its intention, often has us perversely rooting for the so-called bad guys.",1070496000,3,1253,4.648648648648648

Sometimes that which you saw most recently is deemed the best you have seen.  Being aware of this I still say that the 22nd bond movie made is my third favorite, recentcy being not relavent.
The new ""owner"" of the bond enterprise finally keep her politics in check a little bit by just having the writers create strong, interesting and at the same time beautiful female characters to balance and play off of Brosnan's charisma.  M (Bonds female boss) actually was part of the plot this time.  Denise Richards as a 22 year, built and gorgeous nuclear physicist was a stretch, but I smiled and accepted it.  Elektra King (Sophie Marceau) is deliciously powerful, vulnerable and beautiful.  For families there is no cursing with only a suggestion of sex and nudity.  This was to be Desmond Llewelyn's (Q) last bond film, but sadly he died shortly after its release in a car accident, preventing any cameo's that health considerations might have allowed.  I still think that Tim Dalton was closest to the Fleming novels bond, but Brosnan is so good that he will probably rank as the second best bond after Sean Connery.",1055980800,6,1281,4.7040358744394615
1077421,5,6305784906,"After a surprisingly dismal entry in Tomorrow Never Dies, Pierce Brosnan bounces back with an emphatic performance in Bond #19, The World Is Not Enough.  That is not to say Brosnan's outing in his previous film was horrendous (In fact, Brosnan was solid in Tomorrow Never Dies), but he was graced with a more alluring storyline, although at times spotty in its execution.  Aside from the unimpressive Bond girl stint of the stunning and delectable Denise Richards, all aspects of the film computed to make The World Is Not Enough a worthy rival to the classic Goldeneye, as Brosnan's best Bond film.
The plot takes a cue from Dalton's The Living Daylights, in that it is dark, deliberate, methodical, complicated and hence, somewhat confusing.  The story starts off with Bond in a Swiss bank located in Bilbao, Spain, where our hero secures the money of a wealthy oil magnate, Sir Robert King.  Bond returns to MI6 in London and hands over the the cash to King, but he is mysteriously assassinated thereafter.  007 deduces his daughter, Elektra King, played brilliantly by the unbelievably sultry Sophie Marceau, will be targeted next by King's killer.  Bond believes that an anarchist, Renard (Robert Carlyle of The Full Monty fame), who has a bullet entrapped in his brain, near his medulla oblongata and had previously kidnapped Elektra, is the one responsible for King's untimely death and will be Elektra's potential assailant.  With that, Bond ventures to Azerbaijan, where Elektra is organizing an operation to build a breakthrough oil pipeline, to shield Elektra and hunt down the suspected terrorist.  As Bond further delves into his investigation, he exposes that Elektra has Stockholm Syndrome, meaning she has fallen in love with her abductor, Renard and it turns out she was just playing Bond all along.  Together, Elektra and Renard attempt to take control of the Western oil supply, by detonating a nuclear bomb in Istanbul, where all three competing pipelines lead to.  Bond tags along with nuclear scientist, Dr. Christmas Jones (Denise Richards), who earlier attempted to thwart Renard in his successful quest to capture a nuclear bomb at a nuclear bomb deactivation facility, to save the day.
The World Is Not Enough is a fun, provocative, edge-of-your-seat thriller, exhibiting Brosnan at the top of his game.  This is Brosnan's most inspired performance, even more so than Goldeneye, as he seems to display more passion into this effort.  Equally impressive is the show-stopping Sophie Marceau, who portrays Elektra, as the mentally frenetic, chilling, yet thrilling ""good-girl-gone-really-bad"" vixen.  Marceau stands out as the best Bond girl villain in the entire series and an honorable mention as one of the very best Bond girls, overall.  Robert Carlyle is cold and calculating as the menacing, seemingly invincible, impervious, and tragic Renard.  Denise Richards is not as bad as what many critics and die-hard or casual Bond fans would claim her to be.  Definitely, Denise is pretty on-screen eye candy, but of course, she is not exactly gifted in acting skills, and her outing is no exception, though she was used quite well, in that she had rather simple lines in the film.  The supporting cast receives kudos for being a solid cast.  Valentin Zukovsky (Robbie Coltrane), as previously seen in Goldeneye, steps into a bigger role, as a comic relief tough guy.  M (Judi Dench) also receives a boost into a magnified role and she is surprisingly solid.  Of course, Q, played by the late Desmond Llewellyn makes a short, bittersweet farewell appearance.
As for the story and screenplay, The World Is Not Enough comes through with an excellent rhythmic flow, although the events tend to zip and zap with quick transitions, at times.  The action sequences are formidable and more impactful than those of Goldeneye, in my honest opinion.  The rip-roaring pre-title sequence sets the tone of the film beautifully, with the pipeline and Nuclear bomb hijack scenes standing out.  The climax is superb and suspenseful, especially the torture scene where Elektra, in sultry, methodical fashion, gets closer and closer to breaking Bond's neck.  To cap it all off, Garbage, with the sexy redhead lead Shirley Manson at vocals, rocks with an excellent theme song.  All in all, The World Is Not Enough is a sexy, smart, rollercoaster of an adventure, which probably unseats Goldeneye as Brosnan's finest accomplishment as Bond.",1055548800,7,4443,5.1120331950207465

MGM/UA's DVD anamorphic 2:35:1 transfer is very well represented.  Colors are bold, vibrant and natural looking.  Black and contrast levels are bang on.  Edge enhancement and shimmering are at a bare minimum. Film and digital grain are practically non-existant.  The 5.1 soundtrack is explosive, with agressive engagement in all channels.  Dialogue sounds very natural.  Some of the explosions may be too intense for your speakers at regular listening levels.  Extras? - Poorly represented considering what the other Bond titles have offered us but, then again, the Bond pool of resources has pretty much been exhausted on the other discs.  A featurette and stills, audio commentary and trailer are all we get.  Still, this is a nice offering from MGM and well worth your time and money.

1077426,3,6305784906,"I don't really know what it is about this particular Bond movie, but it comes up a bit short. This is by no means because of anyone involved, because it is a very well done film that looks great. It starts off with the usually great opening sequence before the credits, which also includes Bond getting pretty hurt for the first time, but it then goes from mearly good to just simply okay. Pierce Brosnan returns for his third go around as Bond and he is as assured and confident in the role as ever. The most confident one has been in the role since the good old days of Sean Connery. Let's start off with the plot. Bond is assigned to protect an oil heiress named Elektra King(played by the sensual and beautiful Sophie Marceau), after her oil tycoon father is murdered in the opening teaser. Elektra was once kidnapped by a terrorist named Renard(Robert Carlyle). What Bond eventually finds out, albeit being too late, is that Elektra has fallen in love with Renard during that time and the two of them are now in cohorts with each other. The main villainous plot has Elektra intending to destroy Istanbul by exploding a submarine , which would then force the world to rely on her own pipeline. Along the way, James teams up with a nuclear physicist named Christmas Jones(Denise Richards). 007's boss M(the always great Judi Dench), is caught up in it and is also kidnapped by Renard. Bond villains have always been a great part of the franchise. Carlyle's Renard is seen so little, and given nothing to do, and he feels like he's just there to stand and look sinister. Elektra is a far more interesting and watchable character. Bond also meets up with Valentin Zukovsky(Robbie Coltrane), previously seen in ""Goldeneye"". The action is good, but it's been tamed way down from the previous film, ""Tomorrow Never Dies"". It's apparent that the filmmakers wanted to tame the action and make it a little more plot driven like older Bond films. What this one needed IS a bit more action. It's a talky film which drags on and on. It's also sad to know that this was the final appearance of our beloved Q, played by Desmond Llewelyn. He died in a car wreck not long after. In his scenes with John Cleese, it is obvious that Q was being prepped to leave anyway. At least Cleese is a brilliant new addition. The Denise Richards part is laughable. While she is beautiful and nice to look at, her acting is something to be desired, and the mere thought of her as a nuclear physicist is a joke. Who's going to buy that?. Brosnan is Bond. He seemed comfortable with the role from the beginning, and now he just seems to be Bond. It makes you think - Roger and Timothy who?. Like any other Bond film, the movie is filled with gadgets galore, and great locations. The film is as entertaining as you would expect a 007 picture to be, but there's just something there that just doesn't hit the mark. The latest film, ""Die Another Day"", is a lot better and more entertaining.",1043884800,3,2958,4.520522388059701

My FAVORITE bond girl in Sophie Marceau. SHE IS SO GORGIOUS. And one of the few leading bond girls that isent a bimbo or a whining dumb blond.  Renard is a cool villin. Just not the best, but DEFINITLY not the worst. This movie establishes Brosnans Bond as a human being.  Bond gets hurt and is more vunerable then ever before. I just have one little complaint about this movie that gives it only 4 stars.  And that is Denise Richards.  Wrongly casted. She is only eye candy.

1077570,5,6305784906,"After a somewhat confusing entry with ""Tomarrow Never Dies,"" this Bond film goes back to basics:  Bond is trying to stop a notorious terrorist and one of his former kidnap victim from taking over the world's oil supply by nuking Istanbul.  Once again, we get solid action, this time from new director Michael Apted, who shows us a rousing airboat chase in the siberian mountains and Bond and one of his new squeezes racing down an oil pipe to outrun a bomb ready to blow them to noting than ashes.  It all seems formulaic, but who the hell cares?  Pierce bronsnan is the best Bond since Sean Connery and they are enough plot twists and surprises to keep it all going.  One thing I especially like about this film, is the way they go back to Goldeneye and reprise the role of Valentine.  With all other Bond films, they seem to forget the last film and just go on; so that was a nice touch.
One last reason why I consider this one of the better Bond films, is because they show a scenario that really could happen. Oil is getting more scarce nowadays and people may exploit that to make boatloads of cash for themselves, which is what the villians do here.  Unlike most Bond films, this one is utterly believeable.",1040515200,4,1213,4.436936936936937
1077571,2,6305784906,"Messily directed, over-produced and over-long 007 flick has Bond protecting the beautiful Elektra King, the daughter of a petroleun magnate who was killed by the villainous Renard, a terrorist planning the massive destruction of a oil pipeline.  After saving Elektra's life-and becoming romantically involved with her as well-Bond's subsequent investigation leads him to suspect she may not be as innocent as she appears.
After surviving a series of standard hair-raising action set-pieces, including an air-born buzzsaw attack that is both exciting and ridiculous(and typically over-long), Bond finds his mission even more complicated when M (Judi Dench) stupidily gets herself kidnapped.  This is the  most unacceptable portion of the film.  M, whom should be wiser than all the Double O's put together, should never had fallen for such an obvoius ploy.
With the aid of a sexy, busty nuclear physicist played by Denise Richards (the less said about her performance the better)007 goes forward and eventually saves the day.
  The weakest film in the Brosnan era to date, nevertheless has many strong points to offer.  Brosnan is good and Robert Carlyle does well with his underwritten part as the villain who feels no pain because of a bullet lodged in his brain.  Most Bond adversaries would gleefully relish this but Renard spends much of the film moping about how he can't feel love.  Also good is Sophia Marceau the central figure of the movie, who's not quite what she seems.  Robbie Coltrane makes a welcomed return although his character has nothing really to do.  John Cleese joins the series as the new Q, replacing the much beloved Desmond Llewelyn, who sadly died shortly after this film was released.",1039824000,,1713,5.148014440433213
1077572,4,6305784906,"I thought I'd never say this, but Pierce Brosnan ties Daniel Craig for the best Bond since the very young Sean Connery (slurp, drool.) Yes, Dalton is cool as a silk shirt, but somehow, I didn't, uh, bond with him as a Bond. This Bond film is really about the best I've seen so far. It delivers what we all expect from Bond films-action and plenty of it, gadgets, intricate plot, one bad girl and one good Bond girl.

The Bond girl here is Denise Richards (Starship Troopers) who works as an unlikely atomic physicist in shorts and tee shirt (think Lara Croft) and has an even more unlikely name ""Christmas Jones."" She is outshone, however, by lovely Sophie Marceau as Electra King, poor little rich girl gone bad.

In fact, what makes this film as enjoyable is that the supporting cast is excellent. Lead bad guy Renard is well played by Robert Carlyle, Judy Dench makes an admirable (if somewhat stupid) M, and we get to see Desmond Llewlyn as ""Q"" one last time. The direction by Michael Apted is tight. The film never falters.

The stunts are spectacular, including an opening boat chase on the Thames that makes you appreciate the art of stunt filming without the assist of CGI graphics. The predictable helicopter makes its appearance, but with a real twist-dragging some kind of tree-trimming sawblades that do amazing things to buildings.

The only quibble I have is that the villain --a man who feels no pain is a ridiculous concept. There are people who feel no pain, and they end up pretty much incapacitated, not to mention that a bullet even brushing the medulla oblongata stops your breathing . Too unbelievable and really, the lack of pain part was not even needed for the script. Dumb.

The DVD surround sound quality was distinct. The extras include scenes of ""how we did this"" material that can be brought up as an option-nice for subsequent viewings.",1039305600,,1867,4.679878048780488
1077573,4,6305784906,"Pierce Brosnan's first two Bond films were frothy fun. According to director Michael Apted, Brosnan went into this film with the desire to look further inside the character of 007.  Scriptwriters Purvis and Wade delivered and the result is one of the finest films in the 40 year old series.
Brosnan seizes the character of Bond and makes it his own in this picture.  No longer a comical superhero, this Bond gets injured, feels pain, and becomes emotionally involved in the mission.  His feelings betray him and he is left to salvage the situation to the best of his abilities.  ""This time it's personal"" has become a Hollywood cliche but it really is true for Bond this time around.  Not only is the central character given more depth and complexity, but many of the supporting roles are well written and superbly acted.  Special mention must be made of Sophie Marceau's performance as Elektra and Robert Carlyle as Renard, a villain who shows real pathos but never truly elicits the audience's full sympathy due to his horrific crimes.
Of course, being a Bond film, it also has plenty of humor and outrageous action-oriented set pieces. And I could have done without the ridiculous character Christmas Jones (she alone prevents this film from earning a full 5 stars from me).  But at least this time the dialogue in the movie really serves to advance both the characters and the plot rather than being just window dressing.

Yep. I can certainly understand the low ratings for this film.  It was absolutely a tremendous let down. Especially after the mind bender that  Tommorow Never Dies was.
First the biggest problem is the plot. The story just drags on and on without any climaxes. It is boring. Very boring. I kept waiting for it to pick up but it never did.
The second problem was the supporting cast. Whoever made the descision to cast Sophie Marceaux as femme fatale. Made a fatale mistake. She's a joke. Issabelle Adjani would have been a much better choice. The same goes for the villain Robert Carlisle--I really did not find him that scary or effective as a villain.
Denise Richards was nothing but eye candy and does nothing to enhance the movie. If she had not been in the film I would not have missed her at all.
The only pluses in this film are Pierce Brosnan who did a great job again. As well as the witty double entendres ""I was wrong Christmas does come twice a year!"" Which I found quite amusing.
Frankly the film feels as if it had been slapped together so that they could meet the quota of 2 years between Bond films. After this travesty no wonder the creators wanted to take 3 years instead of two for putting out the next film (Die Another Day). Just so to make sure that they do not make the same mistake.

1077694,3,6305784906,"""The World is Not Enough,"" is a very good Bond film, and is great entertainment. Sadly, the film suffers from the following:
1. The action scenes seemed very tired. The boat chase, ski chase, and the submarine battle had no real spice to them at all. It's as if Michael Apted focused on the drama, and put the action in as an afterthought.
2. Denise Richards is awful as Christmas Jones. She might be pretty but she sure can't act. The line where she says, ""Or are you just hoping for a glimmer?"" makes me wince each time.
3. The villains are boring. When this film was being hyped, they made such a big deal about Renard (Robert Carlyle) being impervious to pain. Well they did absolutely nothing special with this facet of the character.
4. The film drags. You start to feel tired about halfway through, and by the time you get to the final submarine battle, you are looking at your watch. This film is about the same length as ""Tomorrow Never Dies,"" but it feels 3 hours long. ""Tomorrow Never Dies,"" is so exciting it only feels like 90 minutes!

1077700,2,6305784906,"The World Is Not Enough isn't quite bad.  It's just...bland.  After the dizzying high of GoldenEye and a fairly strong showing in Tomorrow Never Dies (Jonathan Pryce's awful performance excluded), the franchise was looking on the up and up.  The World Is Not Enough doesn't fulfill the
expectations, however; a swirl of bad choices and too much style-over-substance make this the weakest Bond film since the Roger Moore days.
Pierce Brosnan shows his weak spots as an actor in this film.  The prospect of James Bond and M (dependable Judi Dench) being challenged in their moral stance is just rift with possibilities, but director Michael Apted was content with just scratching the surface of the dilemma; Brosnan, saddled with the character's guilt complex, is unable to surpass more than just a couple of puppy-dog guilty looks, and thus damages the character's credibility.  Of course, Dench and Brosnan are not helped by an atypically erratic, shallow performance by Sophie Marceau.  She is quite pretty and has shown ability in the past, but in this world, she flutters between screaming, hysterical weakling and icy, sadistic maneater with no conviction.  It's not an easy mix to begin with, and Marceau just doesn't pass the mustard.  Denise Richards is of course just a token pretty face in here, ""Dr. Christmas Jones"" easily the most laughable Bond girl in the last 20 years.  When Apted tries to make us take her seriously, the ludicrous nature of the casting choice and script sink his intentions, and when he tries to bury her into the background, it merely points out that the character is window dressing.
Robert Carlyle, thankfully, offers up some solace on the acting front, projecting a more human, wounded sensibility into his terrorist character.  He, too, is relegated to the sidelines, inexplicably, in favour of the much weaker Marceau.
After the pretty outrageous initial chase (where high hopes of Il Postino's Maria Grazia Cuchinotta becoming a Bond girl are dashed), the action sequences also fall low.  The ending of The World Is Not Enough is an all-time low, a vacuous attempt at a hand-to-hand fight sequence sabotaged by bad staging and shooting.

1077702,4,6305784906,"THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH (TWINE) edges out GOLDENEYE by a narrow margin to claim the title of best Brosnan Bond, in my opinion.  The plot is intriguing and Brosnan as Bond displays a little bit more complexity this time around.  We get hints that Bond actually feels.  Another plus is Sophie Marceau in what is probably the best Bond girl role.  Her role has even more complexity and depth to it, and in my opinion, she makes this movie.
The plot revolves around the murder of British Oil magnate Sir Robert King.  Bond eventually begins to suspect that the tycoon was killed by a shadowy terrorist named Renard (Robert Carlyle) who kidnapped King's daughter, Elektra (Sophie Marceau) several years ago.  At M's behest, King did not pay the ransom (due to the UK government's policy to not negotiate with terrorists).  Elektra eventually managed to escape, and Renard wasn't heard from again.  Until now.  Fearing Renard is trying to exact revenge for the botched kidnapping, Bond travels to Elektra's side to protect her.  But there is more to Elektra than meet's the eye....  And this is where the movie kicks into high gear.  Bond finds himself in the middle of an attempt to steal a nuclear bomb from a decomissioned test site.  The terrorists succeed, and nearly manage to kill Bond and one of the nuclear scientists at the site, Dr. Christmas Jones (Denise Richards, in a severely underrated performance).  Suspecting the worst about Elektra and Renard, Bond teams up with Christmas and they race against time to foil a plot to destroy competing oil pipe-lines before it's too late.
What separates TWINE from its predecessors is a marked complexity to the proceedings.  No one is completely good or evil.  Everyone is flawed and painted in shades of gray.  Bond is better here than he's ever been in the hands of Brosnan.  Sophie Marceau is simply terrific as the multi-layered Elektra.  Renard is a little underutilized and underdeveloped, but Carlyle makes it work because of his skills.  Denise Richards has caught a lot of flack for her performance.  Even I thought she was miscast when I first saw this movie, but now I realize its because Sophie Marceau is so awesome as Elektra that any other Bond girl would suffer in comparison.  Upon subsequent viewings, I've decided that Denise Richards really isn't so bad.  Her introductory scenes are smartly played.  She has a real sass in these scenes.  She may appear too young, but hey this is a Bond movie.  The real fault lies with the writers.  As good as this story is, they should have filled out her role a little bit more.  Denise Richards did what she could with the material, and I think has been the unfair target of critics.  The writers should have let her defuse the bomb at the end of movie, allowing her to leave a stronger impression.  Instead, it's Bond who saves the day again.  But I guess that's the point.
All in all, this a great Bond movie.  Complex, surprising, with texture and depth.  Let's hope DIE ANOTHER DAY is as good.  And once more, Sophie Marceau is the best Bond girl.  A close second, third, and fourth are Izabella Scorupco and Famke Janssen (Natalya Simonova and Xenia Onatopp, respectively,in GOLDENEYE) and Denise Richards as Dr. Christmas Jones (she really isn't that bad, folks).",1022889600,3,3278,4.772241992882562

Why and how on earth have this movie hit the screen in the first place bits me , and only seeing it yourself will make you realize just how bad it is . As usual in these cases I shall do my best to convince you about the true nature of this movie , and help you to come to the pass over decision .
Upon seeing this Bond flick , soon enough would you come to terms with the fact that this film belongs to the ""has no standing ability whatsoever"" category . The plot is one of the weakest , stupidest and most embarrassing the silver screen has suffered from the Bond's series . As an avid Bond's fan I do claim to be , I had to digest confusing nets of conspiracies on top of conspiracies, which are interweaved together on account of vague reasons of revenge , spite , power and greed . I feel like there is no point in even trying to track down the main occurrences and actions since they are generally puzzling , on occasions disconnected , and frustrating even to the most welcoming and patient viewer .
This time it is not my opinion alone , since I share the same feelings with a bunch of guys that had seen the movie and became completely numb in the end . The feeling was so common that we just looked at each other with no expression on our faces and immediately continued to another movie to erase and forget the disappointment and rage .
Nevertheless , to hit the main problem , it seems the main action scenes were designed to meet the hunger for pyrotechnics of the special effects division , and not the plot's ones . Unfortunately , these needs were taken to the extreme and left no room for real movie . In other words , the viewer gets the impression that someone had thought first of the way and style the fights and battles would have to be conducted , the landscape and the places in which they are going to take place , the High-Tech gadgets that would participate , and then , only then , built a framework story . It does not work .
I know people also expect these kind of things from a Bond's release , but you will have to believe me the outcome has crossed the line this time . This motion picture is almost a complete joke and disgraces the entire series . Even if considered as an attempt to be a farce about the Bond's series (which is a declared farce on spy movies in the first place , and sometimes a good one) it fails inclusively in almost each and every aspect you can think of : script , acting , logical sequence , dialogue and even in the love scenes . But you'd have to remember , of course , that the special effects are a bomb ...

The story for the film is the biggest problem. Over-complicated and contrived, it at least provides some good action scenes. However, apart from the excellent pre-credits opening scene the action and stunts feel laboured and sometimes un-involving.

1077799,4,6305784906,"Bond. James Bond. Those three words are known around the globe. They conjure up more than a series of movies dating back to 1962. They make us feel at home. Once again we are invited to spend a couple of hours with an old friend whom many of us have known all of our lives. Naturally, all meetings with a friend are not equally memorable, and The World is not Enough is not the greatest of our visits with agent 007. Still, it is better than a lot of them, and it's always nice to see Mr. Bond. Perhaps he can by now be viewed as the ultimate Peter Pan, and if that is true, then certainly he is also the most charming.
The world has changed in the nearly forty years Bond has been around. The Cold War is long over, so the creative team behind The World is not Enough brought back two of the movies' longest running villains - the mad anarchist and the insanely greedy capitalist. In a fairly ingenious twist, they have managed to make these two diametrically opposed forces allies through, of all things, love. I won't say more about this for fear of spoiling the plot. This element does give the movie more interesting plot twists than the last couple of Bond efforts. There is also, for once, an attempt to keep the audience guessing about one character's true intentions.
There are several things that are givens in any 007 movie. James will have lots of new toys to play with. There will be a beautiful and forceful woman whom Bond will conquer, yet there will be lingering doubts at the end as to who conquered who. Q will never laugh at one of his jokes. M will never acknowledge to him that he is the best spy in the world. James will always beat the bad guys because none of them can shoot straight even though their lives depend on it.
I personally like Pierce Brosnan as 007, although he wins in my eyes by default, since no one will ever top the original Bond, Sean Connery. Judi Dench as M and Desmond as Q are more than satisfactory. John Cleese plays a new character called R, who is Q's future replacement, and this addition provides for several comic moments.
There are also great performances by two excellent actors, Robert Carlyle and Sophie Marceau. Carlyle, a star in his native Great Britain, is the dreaded terrorist Renaud, who is more than happy to wipe out a major city with an atomic bomb just to prove a point. Marceau is Elektra King, the daughter of a billionaire oil tycoon. Electra was once held for ransom by Renaud, and when her father is assassinated by a terrorist group, she turns to the British secret service for help. Naturally, Renaud is the group's leader. There is one fly in the acting ointment. Denise Richards turns in a dreadful performance as a nuclear scientist named Dr. Christmas Jones. Ms. Richards was very good in a thriller called Wild Things, and her career survived her being cast in the abysmal Starship Troopers. Whether it can survive this role remains to be seen.
Rated PG-13. Not much here that will harm the kids. I should point out that 007 is not quite the gentleman he was 30 to 40 years ago. Back then he would never have shot an unarmed assailant, no matter how dastardly the person was. The modern Bond has become rather pragmatic about these things.",1016496000,,3221,4.461016949152542
1077800,4,6305784906,"Actually, I think that nearly every James Bond movie could be called ""stupid but fun,"" but this one has more fun than any other in quite a few years.  If you're looking for a thoughtful plot and well-drawn characters, well, what are you doing looking at a James Bond film?  But if you want James Bond doing what he does (blowing stuff up, drinking martinis), well, this movie is as good as most of the others.
I'm surprised to be saying this, because I agree with most of the criticisms leveled at the movie.  Yes, the villian Renard is a non-entity, and by the end of the movie, he's more pitiable than threatening.  And Pierce Brosnan still hasn't quite recaptured that wounded, cynical flavor that made Goldeneye such an exceptional movie.  And you probably didn't notice the outcry when Denise Richards was passed over for an Oscar (the award for Most Inappropriately Dressed Nuclear Physicist having been eliminated the year before).
But the good far outweighs the bad.  Let's face it -- when you go to see a James Bond movie, you're looking for excessive explosions and gunplay.  Here, you get excessive explosions and gunplay.  You also get solid acting by Sophie Marceau and Judi Dench.  And even the most ardent detractor must admit that Pierce Brosnan at 75%, as he is here, is about 20 times as good as Roger Moore at 100%.  All this is to say, leave your thinking cap at the door and enjoy the beautiful sight of stuff blowing up.  You'll feel much better.",1014163200,,1468,4.629343629343629

1077802,2,6305784906,"I've heard a *lot* of criticism of this Bond film and I have to say that I agree with most of it. It *did* have the potential to be a great addition to the series, but ended up being far too long and greatly lacking any good characterization.
My biggest problem with *World* is the villain--Renard. The beginning of the film sets him up to be an enormous challenge for Bond--a man who feels no pain, who can push himself stronger and harder than any ordinary man. However, there is absolutely no sign of this later in the film. Aside from two early scenes that display his imperviousness to pain, he might as well *be* an ordinary man.
Another serious problem I have is with the characterization of *all* the women in the movie. As pointed out by several other reviewers, Denise Richards is--at best--comical as Dr. Christmas Jones, the shorts-clad nuclear scientist who ends up as Bond's main crush. On the other hand, Sophie Marceau is ridiculously dramatic as villainess Electra King who pouts childishly throughout the entire film, despite everyone's insistence of her strength in overcoming her ""kidnapping."" I regret to say that even though I adore Judi Dench and Samantha Bond as ""M"" and Moneypenny, respectively, I have an incredibly hard time accepting that the former *would* walk into a trap like the one set for her. Similarly, I believe that Moneypenny has tradionally shown herself to be above the petty jealousy she seems to display toward Dr. Molly Warmflash (what a ridiculous name!) early in the movie.
Finally, (and this would likely take care of the film's seemingly endless length) there seem to be a lot of unnecessary sweeping views of vast Eastern European landscapes, which could be shortened or done without entirely.
All this said, I *do* think that there are some wonderful fight and chase scenes in the movie (and superb music to go along with them)--namely the awesome boat chase at the beginning, the parahawk chase through the French Alps and the fight scene at the banker's office in the opening sequence. The attack at Zukovsky's factory was also quite entertaining, despite the fact that Bond's awesome BMW was destroyed almost before he could use it!
I *do* wish that these few positive notes could erase all the bad factors in the film, as, like I said earlier, I believe it had real promise to develop some highly complex characters. However, aside from some traditionally great Bond special effects and fight sequences, this can really only ever be, in my opinion, a second-rate Bond film.",1012348800,,2528,4.854166666666667

1077907,4,6305784906,"In outing number 19 and Brosnan's third attempt at James Bond, The World is Not Enough recaptures the essence of From Russia With Love - perhaps the most espionage-oriented (least action theme) of all the Bond movies. Of Brosnan's efforts this is clearly his best, for he has now settled comfortably into the role, has fun with it, yet at the same time manages to give Bond a darker, grittier side which contrasts with the Playboy demeanour Moore gave the character. For Brosnan acting as playboy is merely a means to an end, and the grittier aspect Brosnan portrays is acknowledgement of this.
The realism in The World is not Enough leaves Goldeneye and Tomorrow Never Dies in the boy's league, while it strongly marches into a more muscular league. This film was billed as the movie where Bond grows up, and it certainly lives up to it.
Denise Richards is perhaps the biggest drawback of the film, not truly suitable for playing a cerebral character. Carlyle, while adequately portraying the villian Renard, just lacked enough on-screen presence to truly make him menacing. Also, the movie tries to cash in on the Oscar successes of Dame Judi Dench by giving her more screen time, and while her acting is flawless, the way she is written further into the story is somewhat contrite. This is easily tolerable since she is such a wonderful actor to watch.
The movie relies moreso on character interaction and not over-the-top action sequences or typical Bond glib remarks. All one-liners are quickly dealt with in time for the movie to settle into a neat political game of cat-and-mouse.

Pierce Brosnan (""Grey Owl"", ""GoldenEye"", ""Tomorrow Never Dies"", ""Mrs. Doubtfire"", ""The Tailor of Panama"") reprises his role as Bond, James Bond for the third time and he is better then ever. In the 19th bond film, the cast is back and also gets better than ever. The story starts off with Bond rescuing a suitcase of money and then finds out that he is in the chase of his life trying to avenge a friend's death and stop a man from a nuclear war! 'M' (Dame Judi Dench, ""Mrs. Brown"", ""Chocolat"") informs Bond of what he's dealing with and wants to know the details of how her friend, Mr. Robert King died. Mr. King owns an oil company and his daughter, Elektra King (Sophie Marceau, ""Lost and Found"") inherits it. Bond now must protect her from death also. Renard (Robert Carlyle, ""The Full Monty"", ""The Beach"") is the villain who can't feel pain or pleasure because of a bullet in his brain. Because of this condition, he is basically unstoppable and a worthy adversary for 007. When Bond's adventure continues, he meets the lovely Dr. Christmas Jones (Denise Richards, ""Tail Lights Fade"", ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"", ""Valentine""), a nuclear physicist. Renard gets hold of a nuclear warhead and plans for the worst.

1077910,5,6305784906,"What makes a good film?  Without a doubt, it must have a good plot, a capable director and good actors.
What makes an excellent film?  The inclusion of the above into a good script, great special effects and a good soundtrack.
When I first saw TWINE at the cinema, I thought it was a good film but nothing special.  Later, when I got the DVD, I contrasted it to the other Bond films and realised just how good it was:
TWINE has one of the more realistic plots.  I thought the plot in Moonraker was absurd, for example.  I think that when super-villians plan to blow up the world that [just-possibly] they are going too far.  Instanbul, the target in TWINE, is not a huge target (like London in GoldenEye), and while important, as highlighted in the Film, would not cause global economic breakdown in quite the same way.  By the way, I thought it was excellent, the way M was brought into the fray along with the fact the Bond girl is a true villian.
Michael Apted is a great director who knows how to keep an audience on the edge of their seats.  The action sequences were superb, some of the best, and least ridiculous that we have seen in Bond films.  I liked the idea of the helicopters with the circular blades, particularly because they were introduced earlier in the film at the pipeline cutting down trees.  All too often in films, you see machines specially designed for killing and they have no other purpose.  The helicopters were everyday machines that were sent to the caviar factory with the intent of killing Bond.
A special mention must be made about the boat chase.  On the DVD, there are documentaries about the making of this.  Apparently it took 6 weeks to shoot the 10 minute pre-title sequence (I think the longest in Bond history, so far) and it is worth every hour that was spent on producing it.  It doesn't have too many silly bits (but this of course is what makes a Bond film, as long as they're not TOO silly) and yet is extremely exciting.
The music in the film was written and produced by David Arnold (Godzilla and Tomorrow Never Dies).  One of the great things about him is his ability to use the orchestra well.  Although the soundtrack is by no means John Williams (Star Wars, ET and Superman), it isn't supposed to be, because Arnold throws synthesizers and ethnic beats into the works as well.  At first, the soundtrack seemed disjointed and I thought there were too many synthesized parts, but now I have changed my mind.  Soundtracks are written to compliment the film not to listen to exclusively.  Arnold manages to keep the on-screen tension extremely high during the action scenes and this is demonstrated superbly by the opening boat chase.
Pierce Brosnan, for me, is definitely up there with the ""definitive"" Bond (Connery).  Brosnan's smooth, suave and caring Bond is more 3-dimensional than Moore and Dalton, not to mention Lazenby.  Although this maybe is taken too far in the film in places (straightening tie while boat is diving under barrier near the beginning), it is great fun to watch.  The three films with Brosnan rival Connery's From Russia with Love, GoldFinger and You Only Live Twice.  I think these are the best 6 films in the whole Bond series.  Some of the other films are more fun, but these are the most substantial.
It is commonly agreed among Bond fans, that On Her Majesty's Secret Service possibly would be the absolute King of Bond films if Connery had played the part the part of Bond (George Lazenby).  This film has everything EXCEPT Bond.  One thing I particularly liked about TWINE is the intricate plot that not too many of the Bond films have.  I hope that this is a nod to OHMSS and that more Bond films might have plots this good.
In conclusion, superb film.  Great Bond film.
By the way, I wonder if anyone agrees with me that it would be good to see Bond pre-mission at some point.  Bond is an agent who must need to be constantly working when he is not on a mission.  He would need to practise firearm skills, keep fit, practise languages (other than in bed - TND).  In real life (sorry to keep harking back to it) Bond would be on a mission once or twice a year and would be working hard on skills all the rest of the time, as highlighted in the books.

1077911,3,6305784906,"Remember when Roger Moore would blurt out a smart unexpected remark in the middle of an awkward situation? Like the time he shot a sniper when he was out hunting birds with the villian Drax in ""Moonraker"", -"" you missed, Mr. Bond...""- then we see the sniper fall down from the tree- ""did I...""- said Moore. Those times are lost forever, it seems, since now, sarcasm has taken over. The world is not enough tried to bend the formula towards a dramatic plot which would let the characters - usually stereotypes- to be more three dimensional. Instead we get a too long, too predictable movie and by the number scenes. I mean , you just have to look at your watch, and say - 10 minutes have gone by speaking, so the action scene is around the corner. I like the Bond movies, specially the ones with Roger Moore, who for me is the definitive Bond- not Connery. May be, the producers should have guest directors in the franchise like Tarantino- start the movie with the ending, and work your way back- or Tawyker (directed Run Lola Run) having a different character always on the  move, keeping people's path crossing over... What about Robert Rodriguez? He can make a heck of an action movie with a few dollars, and make it look visually satisfying. Michael Apted -who directed this film- has directed other Bond films-better ones- and it seems when you are too close to something, you loose focus. We know the plots are usually silly, and there isn't much room for drama, but that's ok, we watch because we like the gadgets, the villians headquartes, and schemes-how smart are they-, the action sequences, the -now Bond is trapped how is he goin to escape scene, the beautiful women, the cool cars, the funny remarks... That's what we like. If we want drama we rent Steel Magnolias or Othello. Bond should be just fun, adventure, action, and overall , quick pacing- I got bored with The World Is not Enough- This is the worst Bond movie yet, I'm sure many Bond fans will agree. Pierce has so many scenes with Sophie Marceau, that I thought I was watching a soap opera. The world is 25,000 miles at the equator, and somehow Bond keeps goin back to wherever Elektra is. The Villian - Carlyle-from the Full Monty- could have been more interesting had he been shown interacting more with others, but he's established as very strong-physically- and bitter, and that's all. Gert Frobe's Auric Golfinger was an interesting character, who did not like to lose, ever, and was straight foward- in the scene where Connery is about to be sliced with the laser, he says to Auric-""Do you expect me to talk?"" Auric's reply is memorable- ""No Mr. Bond... I expect you to die..."".  You don't get this type of dialogue now. May be the producers need to look at the prior  films to gather the elements that made each movie , in it's own time, so good to watch. A Bond film should not be self aware, leave that to ""Scream"" and ""Scary Movie"". Bond films used to have a finesse, or class that no other movies had, it presented a world of fantasy, a world of original characters that you did not see in other movies, doing things you didn't see in other movies. If Bond is goin to get as sarcastic as Denis Leary or as critical as Howard Stern, then he would be like everyone else. Just throw the tuxedo on Andrew Dice Clay. May be Ms. Broccoli is considering goin back to basics with Bond, which seems to the majority, to be the best course of action. The ending has no punch, like the whole movie. It's weird, but this movie is like a bad remake - by people not affiliated with the franchise-of a Bond film.

1078018,4,6305784906,"Throughout most of Roger Moore's tenure as James Bond, all we heard was how he fell short of Sean Connery's greatness. If you don't count the sidestream ""Never Say Never Again"", Moore actually did one more Bond than Connery. Some ""pinch hitter"", huh. When Timothy Dalton took over, he wasn't around long enough for viewers to either get get used to him or come up with enough ways in which he didn't cut the mustard--less fool he. Then when Brosnan slipped into the role in ""Goldeneye"", all we heard was how ""slight"" he was (??). The truth of the matter is that each of the three ""lifers"" has put his own stamp on the role that is very consistent with James Bond as created by Fleming. Connery was the macho Scotsman, tough as nails and no pretensions--the Bond who was very much the man who turned down knighthood in the book version of ""Man With the Golden Gun"" by sending M a wire that began ""I am a Scottish peasant..."". Moore gave the role the urbane aspect that I think Cary Crant would have (did you know that he was on the short list before they found Connery?). But throughout Fleming's books, the Bond character has had a hot temper that has alternately stood him in good stead and gotten his tail in a wringer. Brosnan exhibits that Bond when the villan Renard taunts him with the fact that he slept with Elektra King before he did. BAM! Enraged, Bond decks him with one shot to the jaw. George Lazenby, another pinch hitter in ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"", wisecracked in an early scene; ""This never happened to the other fellow.""

The entire film is one long set up, where every character must make another startling revelation that steers the plot into another unneeded direction. In fact, plot details are still developing during the ludicrous climax, which involves M being captured by the villains. The film also loses that careful balance of humor, action, and gadgets, which renders the ""serious"" scenes silly and contrived. Then there's the action scenes, which are technically impressive but are so long that they failed to hold my attention.
There are two things that worked well, for me at least. I found Denise Richards to be surprisingly fun and energetic, probably the only person having any fun in the movie. She added some spark to otherwise dull and overblown action sequences. I also really liked the opening action scene on the River Thames.

1078021,5,6305784906,"I can always count on 007 James Bond to take me on an action packed adventure.  ""The World is not Enough"" is one of the best of the series as it explores a deeper side of James Bond.  This film is character driven.  The actions follow the intricate plot in revealing dark, unexpected motives.  The actions, explosions, threats, and character dynamics do not seem to be scripted or contrived.
These villains are complex and shrewd, and the seductive Elektra is capable of capturing Bond's heart.  The reasons for Elektra and Rinard's actions are plausible and more human than in other Bond films.  It does not necessarily make them sympathetic, but there is a great sense of loss captured in the scenes between Rinard and Elektra.
The action scenes are complex and should be viewed more than once to enjoy the full impact.  I am a Bond fan, so I always see the movies more than three times.  The character development in this film gave depth that has been missing in James Bond.  He is human and does care deeply, but he will not let emotions control him.  This makes Pierce Brosnan's Bond equal to Sean Connery's -- and I can think of no higher compliment.
The DVD features are excellent.  Commentaries, interviews, and a music video that is exotic, erotic, and seductive, as any James Bond love theme should be.  The band Garbage takes us on an incredible journey to a high tech world where a beautiful female android is created.  Her kiss of death and the song makes it is easy to see similarities to the plot.
Since this was released in late 1999, I am looking for another 007 movie with Pierce Brosnan soon.  I do hope that Michael Apted will be the director.

1078023,3,6305784906,"Originally, I was disappointed by this film.  A Bond film usually rushes you along headfirst through the action until you sometimes feel just a little giddy.  I thought the character development with the villains in this film slowed that headlong flight, to its detriment.
But in looking at this film a couple more times, I realized something.
Michael Apted really has a good way with the action sequences:  once he gets going, he really throws everything at you ... not only the kitchen sink, but even some of the plumbing.  He puts in so much, as a matter of fact, that I experienced some sensory overload in my first viewing.  It was hard to get a sense of the scenes, and so they blurred past me.
But now, after a couple more viewings, I have a better sense of the action sequences and of what Bond is doing in them.  Consequently, I really enjoy those scenes a lot, with the exception of the skiing sequence, which was disappointing.
Other pluses are that we saw more of the inner workings of MI6 and more scenes with the team backing Bond up.  I love that the series is doing that.  The addition of John Cleese is almost a masterstroke!  (I was sad but glad that ""Q"" had the opportunity to say one last goodbye ... in a scene that has a subtle surreality about it in that is foreshadows his death.)
Brosnan continues to give us that intense, hard, quick and very driven James Bond that he's been giving us since the **awesome** Goldeneye!  And, of course, this movie retains very well the James Bond elegance ... or should I say opulance?  It's difficult not to like an action hero who wears French cuffs!  I wonder if Brosnan gets to keep his wardrobe after filming wraps???
I can't help but think that other Bond fans who were slightly let down by this film might enjoy it more after another look ... if only for the great action sequences.  Even though the character development with the villains seemed to pull back a trifle too hard on the plot's reins, this film gets most of the James Bond panache just right!",991440000,,2022,4.476839237057221
1078024,3,6305784906,"I think the subtlety of Bond has been lost in this movie, and it's not due to Brosnan as such, as he had it in ""Goldeneye"". He has become too much of an action hero in the Rambo sense for my liking. I didn't like the story of this one, and the evil villan was very weak in terms of portrayal. We get an impression of how frightening and powerful this villan is through what other characters say and do, but when we see him ourselves, he is rather disappointing! It is not all the fault of the actor, even though he does not have the physical stature to carry off such a role. This is made even more acute by the fact that there is a great build up where we are told that he is just getting stronger and stronger until the day he dies, but it isn't really followed up with the dramatic ending that it could have been. Very run'o the mill, in fact. Also, he bore too much of a resemblence to Blofeld to be convincing in his own right. Somehing went wrong with this Bond movie. Maybe the next one will be better.",988070400,,1009,4.075376884422111

1078026,4,6305784906,"OK, let's face it, Bond fans, this wasn't exactly the best Bond movie ever made (Goldfinger still holds that title), but it certainly wasn't the worst either (that still goes to On Her Majesty's secret Service). And I also want to point out that this Bond movie is still better than just about anything that's been released in the last two months. The production values were certainly more over the top than, say Goldeneye and Tomorrow Never Dies, but that was expected. With technology getting better, the Bond movies will, in fact, change with the technology.
The plot for this Bond was different from some of the other ones, since the enemy happened to be a man, Reinard, that was practically unstoppable, since he had a bullet in his head. Bond's assignment is to protect Elektra King, the daughter of a wealthy oil tycoon because of fear Reinard could strike against her. Along the way, the chase takes him to Valentine's  caviar factory, which Bond nearly destroys, to a chase through the oil pipeline to diffuse a bomb, to motor boat and air-balloon chase over London's Millenium Dome, to the underwater finale.
My only complaint for this Bond movie was the choice of Denise Richards as Dr. Christmas Jones (I don't think they could've come up with a stupider name, either). She kind of gave the whole movie an especially cheesy feel, because either she was trying too hard or not hard enough. Especially with my favorite line in the movie where she yells ""James! It's too risky!"". Come on! You're talking to a guy who's jumped off a cliff to catch a crashing plane (Goldeneye), wrestled with Jaws 30,000 feet above groud(Moonraker), not to mention the countless amount of times he's nearly escaped death, and you're saying ""It's too risky""? Never, ever tell Bond that anything's too risky.
Other than Denise Richards, this Bond was one of the best yet, and proves that no matter what happens, there's always going to be James Bond in some form or another. The scenery for this movie was really something, too. Brosnan should be commended as Bond's savior, since Dalton nearly brought the franchise down.",987033600,,2111,4.815426997245179
1078135,2,6305784906,"This movie was a very big disappointment to me, being a big James Bond fan.  However, after seeing Tomorrow Will Never Die, I guess I shouldn't have expected much.  The action scenes- as well as everything else about the movie- were just so banally cliche and overdone, and the plot wasn't anything special at all. I also thought the thing about the villian was rather stupid and hokey-- ""he was shot in the head, so he will continue to grow stronger and stronger until he dies"". Ummm.....yeah, ok. Well thank god the movie didn't even follow that absurd premise much. Bond films used to be smart, creative and original with unique and fresh scripts. Now, just like most other action movies and sequels and whatnot (recent Bond films, M:I-2, Charlie's Angels, on and on and on) they're just like any other movie out there with snowmobile chases and big explosions. Only with british accents and crazy gadgets. The James Bond series has unfortunately fallen into a very derivative rut, it seems. And I mean really, was there any difference between Tomorrow Will Never Die and The World is Not Enough? I don't think so. God forbid they do something original, creative or intelligent with the series like they used to. They may as well just have named it ""Clich&eacute;d 90s Action Movie #463"".  Also, while most of the cast was fairly good (I think Bronsan makes one of the best Bond yet, a distant second only to Connery), did they really have to write in a physicist named ""Christman Jones"", played by the very young, beautiful, untalented and unconvincingly-""smart"" Denise Richards?  That did nothing for the movie.
But I guess you can't blame'em. They're just catering to the average American audience, who would rather sit through mindless car chases and explosions than something that takes half a brain to appreciate (M:I --> M:I2 , for example....ugh).  If you're a fan of *real* James Bond movies and what made them so popular, infamous and stand out in the first place, skip this movie.  If you want to see a bunch of action scenes and big explosions....and the most beautifully gorgeous woman on earth- Sophie Marcaeu....go out and buy this DVD.",985651200,,2154,4.823848238482385

Price Brosnan shows that, except for Sean Connery, he is the best bond. The idea that the main villian has a head injury that makes him invincible is also original. Denise Richards does an average bond girl performance. But she and Sophie Marceau are the movie's true highlight. The second highlight is the boat chase through the River Thames. The ending is also good as well. Too bad that this is the last time we see Q in a bond film (That new guy, R, just seems like a wimp).

1078137,4,6305784906,"After 1995's excellent 'Goldeneye', Brosnan finally begins to feel comfortable in his role as 007. TWINE is a definite improvement on 'Tomorrow Never Dies' which was pretty forgettable. Bond's nemesis is a terrorist named Renard (Robert Carlyle) a man who feels no pain, thanks to a bullet lodged in his brain. With such an interesting background I thought his character could have been developed further. He might have turned out as a classic Bond villain. Brosnan could do well to loose the brooding scowl because I think he should lighten up a little. In a documentary featured on this disc, Brosnan says he likes having Bond's darker side explored. For this they accused Timothy Dalton of being too stiff and serious! Apart from that Pierce is a great James Bond. He can't be held responsible for the film's shortcomings.

Judi Dench returns as 'M', the head of MI6 and 007's boss. This time around she has a more substantial role. Electra King (Sophie Marceau) and Dr. Christmas Jones (Denise Richards) are the two Bond girls but as usual the girls are present mostly for show and little else. Like Renard, Electra King poses as an intriguing figure but her potential is unrealised. Robbie Coltrane also reprises his 'Goldeneye' role of Valentin Zukovsky. The opening sequence with 007 racing down the river Thames in a power boat is just fantastic. This is also Desmond Llewelyn's last appearance as 'Q', MI6's gadget man. There's a short tribute to him on this disc accompanied fittingly by the theme of The Spy Who Loved Me, 'Nobody Does It Better'.",984096000,,1557,4.875471698113207

1078139,2,6305784906,"Well it's official.  Pierce Brosnan is channelling Roger Moore.  Every time I watch this film all I can see is the Mooreism that started to kill the series for me.  Sure Roger had his moments of pure dramatic acting, but they were always wasted away with a smirk and a quip.  But you could almost forgive him because, those smirks and quips were still funny.  They were a part of him and hence became a part of the character (if you were a GenXer).  But what they also became was formulaic.  When Dalton took over they tried to do the same to him but he managed to rise above it and give his best performances even if the stories weren't as solid.  And when Pierce took over, I think a lot of us agreed that he was a good choice, albiet and almost natural choice.
But man he tries to conquer Connery but comes out looking like Moore and that is exactly what you get with this awful movie.  I remember sitting in the theatre when I saw this film, almost bored to death an embarrassed that I brought my friend to it.  It was a ""paint by numbers"" film that followed the standard rules that have bogged down Bond films in the past.  And I don't know about you but the pre-title scenes moved so damn fast that I had not idea what was going on.  Something about money and reports and Swiss Bankers.  I had to watch this turkey again to get the whole plot.
So if I seem to hate this movie so much why does it still get two stars?  Well, one star goes to Sophia Marceau's performance and the unique role of her character.  Finally a woman who isn't seduced by Bond.  Sure there have been some before but not many.  And the other star goes to the writer (there's only one credited but I'm sure there is a bunch of input from many people) who gave Bond a little pathos and brutality.  But it loses three from first underusing Robert Carlyle, the plot, and Denise Richards, whose performance is so wooden, it drags the film down even further.
If you want to see a good Brosnan film, see Tomorrow Never Dies.  Sure it's still very lame, but he almost seems to make the character his own.  I liked the slick style and almost nostaligic feel of the film.  This one just wreaks of a formula way past it's prime.",981936000,2,2196,4.243373493975904

1078141,4,6305784906,"There are only two actors that have convinced me they can only play James Bond: Sean Connery and Pierce Brosnan. While Connery played the character with much suave and finesse, Brosnan plays it with a more serious and bolder touch. Without getting into too much detail about story or plot for this latest Bond flick it definitley lives up to its title with evil characters that don't know too much of a good thing can be hazardous to their health ! The story or plot is packed with typical Bond-esque twists and turns dealing with explosions,espionage, gadgets and global domination in some form or another concerning the world's leading oil pipelines along with Soviet politics ! In true essence it's any James Bond fan's cinematic treat.
The beautiful and gorgeous French actress Sophie Marceau (from Braveheart fame) is perfect for her role as heiress Elektra King to an oil empire. Even with half her character's ear missing (watch the movie and you'll know why)she's still mesmerizing. The only questionable choice for another character is Denise Richards (Wildthings) for her role as nuclear physicist/scientist Christmas Jones. At times her wooden performance will make some viewers cringe. I know, give Denise Richards time and she will be a ""better"" actress someday. It's just that she seems great for eye candy and nothing else (it's embarrassing since she plays an American scientist among European and British characters/actors). The only other disappointing note is the final cinematic appearnce of British actor Llewellyn as Q ;he passed away shortly after filming this project. The dvd inclusion of Garbage's video and theme title for the film,while the video has it's own Bond storyline, keeps in sync with the  overall effect or subject of world domination and destruction. It's amazing no matter what artist from almost any pop genre is chosen to record the Bond opening themes, they always come out on top ! It's a pleasant surprise to see the group garbage in an almost ""formal"" music video environment without going to wild, extreme, or bizarre (not that that is such a bad thing for the group's own personal musical image---I'm a fan of theirs,also)...

what i really liked about this one is that james bond was used like he used the girls he always slept with. electra found his weakness and exploited it. i always thought james bond would have to be a super-spy, one who would have no weakness, but we find that the quality that we love most about him, his sexiness--getting all the ladies--was just taken advantage of and attacked. i liked that part. it's time bond learned his lesson that sleeping with all the women in the world isn't that good of a thing.

For anyone that has seen the 1987 movie ""The fourth protocol"", you will know what Brosnan is capable of. In that movie he played a lean, mean russian agent. If only his portrayal of Bond was more like that, he would be much more convincing as 007. It was a sad day when Dalton decided not to return as Bond in Goldeneye.",977529600,3,592,4.701923076923077

And leaving aside plot inanities like M's role in the film, Electra's ""secret"" and the thudding climax, what on EARTH made them cast Denise Richards in this? She may be eye candy, but her range clearly extends from the sophomoric ""Starship Troopers"" to the titillating ""Wild Things,"" but no further. Every time she comes on the screen, it makes me want to turn off the TV or, at minimum, the volume. Casting her a nuclear scientist (in hot pants, no less) drew catcalls in the theater, and the experience doesn't improve at home.

1078278,4,6305784906,"When I first heard of the rumors that 'Remington Steele' actor Pierce Brosnan was tapped to play James Bond I felt that the series was in for a good dose of adrenaline it had been lacking in for about half of the Roger Moore films.  But the producers of 'Steele' wouldn't let Brosnan out of his contract, and sorry for us Bond fans, but we had to wait an agonizing 2 more films before they got around to FINALLY securing Brosnan.  This is the role he was BORN to play, and 'The World Is Not Enough' stands side-by-side (in MY opinion) with any of the Bond films of old.
The opening scene alone is just about the BEST of ALL the Bond films and for that matter pretty much ANY film I have ever seen. Ever hear of Sprint Boats?  Well they are miniature speed boats that can actually turn on a dime and the opening scene is a chase (what else?) on the river Thames in London which raps up at the Millinnium Dome and it'll leave you breathless.  While I had a hard time imagining one of the two leading ladies as an honest-to-goodness nuclear physicist, I STILL managed to find a LOT to enjoy in this, I believe the 19th outing for the super-spy.  Let's be honest: We DON'T see a Bond film hoping to stretch our intellect, now DO we?  We go 'cuz we KNOW we're gonna be in for a visual roller coaster ride with a pinch of adrenaline thrown in for good measure--shaken not stirred, please.  This film does NOT disappoint in THIS particular arena.  All of the usual elements of an exciting action/adventure are present, in fact the formula for a typically fantastic Bond film is followed to a 'T' in my opinion.  Shakespear it AIN'T, but let' face it, its a load of fun anyway.",976665600,,1669,4.306709265175719

Anyways, the movie is great and Sophie Marceau is a superb actress displaying huge talent in expressing emotion and vigor in her performance.  A lot of witty lines and the introduction of Q's partner, ""R"", help to make this an A+ movie.  As for the picture and sound on the disc: just as good as the movie.  Solid picture and excellent sound accompanied by a wide list of features, with the most interesting being the audio commentary by the director, make this a DVD to be watched over and over again.

1078280,3,6305784906,"Pierce Brosnan's third 007 outing, ""The World Is Not Enough"" has all the ingrediants die hard fans of the series love, explosions, cool action, gorgeous women and of course Bond himself played by Brosnan, but somehow the film skips a beat.  First off, this 19th Bond epic begins with a bang.  Before the title sequence even starts, Bond has escaped capture from crooked bankers, survived a massive explosion which guts out MI6 headquarters and pursues a really attractive female assasin in what must be the most suped up jet boat in cinema history.  It's just a shame that the rest of the film can't top the exciting first ten or twelve minutes.
The plot is Bond appropriate, Agent 007 is sent to protect a heiress to an oil industry who has been targeted by a super terrorist who is impervious to pain, he has a bullet lodged in his brain.  Before long, Bond embroiled in a complicated (and hard to follow) plot to rule the oil industry and then the world.  What is disappointing about this installment is the films sometimes slow pace and final battle scene.
The climax of the film takes place on a submarine and is too reminiscent of the end of ""Tomorrow Never Dies"".  However, the strengths of the film are in the suprisingly strong performances (excluding Denise Richards).  M has a more prominant role in this round which makes sense because she's played again by Oscar winner Judi Dench.  Her M character is for more empathetic this time and you can tell that she is concerned about Bond's safety.  This is a welcome plot development and I hope that Brosnan and Dench have more dramatic scenes with each other in future Bond films.
While just a tad disappointing, ""The World Is Not Enough"" is entertaining enough.",974764800,13,1720,4.687707641196013
1078281,4,6305784906,"Pierce Brosnan is proving more and more to be a most impressive James Bond.  In this, his third outing, Brosnan gives us a little more insight into who Bond is as well as how he is able to keep it all together.  The opening sequence, which is the longest in Bond history, really sets the tone well for the film, with a wonderful boat chase thrown in (Bond fixing his tie as he goes underwater is a gem).
 But a truly great Bond movie requires good supporting acting as well, and this film has just that, minus one...that of Denise Richards who plays Dr. Christmas Jones (Dr.????).  If she's suppose to be a Nuclear Physicist then I'm a Rocket Scientist.  With an obnoxious personality that just screams ""Kill me quickly"", the only two things Richards is good for is ""Eye Candy"" and getting the younger generation to want to see this movie, which is why she was hired in the first place.  She's almost half Brosnan's age for crying out loud!
 Well, as bad as Richards is, French Actress, Sophie Marceau is completely breathtaking as Elektra King.  Her performance is simply incredible, keeping you glued to the picture for all the right reasons.  As she showed American audiences in her U.S. debut with ""Braveheart"", Sophie evokes a vulnerability that leaves you breathless.  Her strength, determination and cunning instinct, as well as her catlike prowess in this movie give 007 a run for his money.  Finally, a Bond Woman who can take on 007 intelectually and still win out.
 Robert Carlyle, as many know from his performance in ""The Full Monty"", gives a quite unique performance as the villanous, Renard.  I know many critics were quite mixed on their opinion of his performance.  I must go with the positives.  In Bond films we always get these larger than life, truly evil bad guys bent on mass destruction and/or ruling the world.  What a nice change of pace it is to take this formula and add another element to it by making Renard already slowly dying from a bullet wound to the head that is making it's way further and further towards the center of his brain, thereby making him impervious to pain.  One of Carlyle's best scenes is when he's in bed with Elektra (Marceau) and we see this very vulnerable and touching exchange between them, something you never see with Bond villains, giving more dimension to the character.
 Other noteworthy performances are of course, Dame Judi Dench as M, who this time, for a change, finds herself in the field as a prisoner which adds a nice new element.  Robbie Coltrane, who we all should remember from ""Goldeneye"" reprises his role as Valentin Zukovsky with the same wonderful wit he showed us before.  Samantha Bond as Miss Moneypenny still gives us that unique sense of being repulsed by Bond while at the same time admiring him just the same.  And of course, the late, great, Desmond Llewelyn, who played gadget master Q since 1963s From Russia With Love and retires the part in this film to Monty Python alum, John Cleese, who is referred to in the film as R.
 The plot, in case you don't already know, involves the oil pipes owned by Elektra King, with Renard planning to destroy rival pipes, making hers the only ones available and in the process allowing them both complete control over the oil distribution in the far east.
 David Arnold is still in grand form scoring his second Bond movie, with some original touches added but not holding back from the classic themes we've come to love and appreciate.  But the title song, performed by Garbage feels a bit under par when presented here.  It sort of feels like it drags on too much with not enough passion by lead vocalist, Shirley Manson, compared to previous title vocalist, Sheryl Crowe, who's amazing work on ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" is truly inspiring (and I'm not even a fan of hers).  I felt the DVD extras for this Bond Special Edition were a bit light, compared to others.  You do get 2 audio commentaries, the first by Director Michael Apted and the second by Production Designer Peter Lamont, Second Unit Director Vic Armstrong and Composer David Arnold (the 2nd being the most entertaining for me).  There's, of course, a ""making of"" featurette included but it's over much to soon, leaving you stirred, instead of shakin'.
 The Garbage music video is included, but it is very bizarre.  Apparantly, Shirley Manson plays a cyborg being created in a lab to eventually go and kill the real Shirley Manson and blow up a theater full of people where the band is playing.  The opticals are cool, I must admit, while we see Shirley singing while the scientists are working on building her body.  Quite creative.  I just don't understand what it has to do with the movie other than a unique interpretation of the Elektra King character.  Strange, but still worth a look.
 I was also disappointed that you only get the original Theatrical Trailer and not the Teaser Trailer on this DVD.  Where many of the Bond discs include many trailers and TV spots, you'd think the newest Bond films would find it much easier to include theirs, considering they just came out.
 The only other bonus on the disc is ""The Secrets Of 007 Revealed"" an interesting and unique extra that was first used for The Matrix DVD.  When selecting this feature, you watch the film normally until you see the 007 logo appear at the bottom right of your TV screen, then you push the ""Enter"" button on your remote control.  The film stops and you now begin to view some wonderful behind the scenes footage of the action scene you were just watching.  It's a fun feature (you can also view the behind the scenes without watching the film too), I just wish there were more of them.  Still, a nice treat.
 In conclusion, yes, Denise Richards does hurt the movie, somewhat, with her spoiled brat-like attitude, but with plenty of action, nonstop thrills and excitement, The World Is Not Enough still reminds us why we love James Bond, 007!",974592000,5,5911,4.666023166023166

My beef was with how Bond handles both of them. I would change the ending. I'd turn in Electra and bring her boyfriend/villain to justice AND medical treatment to save his life. Instead of ""License to kill"", a ""license to heal"" and have Bond read a letter from Electra in prison thanking him for saving her life, in fact show the villain, as a changed man from his prison cell.
Finish with ""M"" lecturing him on how he's gotten older and wiser, and have him remark, ""its not enough to have a license to kill, sometimes even the world is not enough"". Maybe someone who writes Bond scripts will read this review and in the next film go in a new, unexpected direction.",971049600,4,1254,4.386266094420601
1078423,4,6305784906,"The World Is Not Enough is typical James Bond.  Part thriller and part comedy.  Slick and inventive.  If you're looking for new aspects to the series, you aren't going to get it here.  Part of the charm of 007 is the tried and true formula of doing the same things over and over, but with different characters and new locations.
 The basic plot, which I feel I can give you about the first five minutes because after that I'll spoil it.  It gets too dense to explain anyway, you just have to see it.  An oil-tycoon friend of M's (Judi Dench) is killed, and his daughter is feared to be next after her recent escape from the clutches of a power-hungry madman, Renard (Robert Carlyle).  James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) is sent to protect her and thwart the villain.  I have a confession.  With all my nagging about plot sequence, inconsistencies, characterizations, etc. I must tell you that for a James Bond movie I virtually let all that stuff go out the window.  Not sure why, but since I know the formula so well, it's almost more fun to watch for the trademark stuff.  Let's go through and see which ones you also like watching for.
 James Bond.  007.  The man himself.  There have been many.  No one can hold a candle to Sean Connery.  He IS James Bond.  Everyone since has had some pretty big shoes to fill.  Pierce Brosnan comes to the closest to the master, in my estimation.  Roger Moore was Bond when I was a kid, so I like him because the first one I ever saw was For Your Eyes Only.  Timothy Dalton was a disaster, sheesh, who picked that guy?  But Brosnan affects the same charm, wit and ease of the character as Connery....almost.
 There are always two gorgeous Bond babes.  Bond always sleeps with both of them.  One of them always ends up dead.  Note to female readers: don't sleep with James Bond, because then you only have a 50/50 shot at surviving the next 72 hours or so.  Not good odds, so don't chance it.
 This time it's Elektra King (Sophie Marceau) the daughter of the dead oil tycoon that James must protect and then there's nuclear physicist Christmas Jones (Denise Richards).  I would be remiss if I didn't mention, daring escapes, sensational chase sequences, exotic locations, diabolical villains and fantastical ways to meet one's demise.  My favorite ""weapon"" in this movie was the monstrously huge multi-bladed tree trimmer contraption dangling from a menacing helicopter.  They flew that sucker around sawing through all kinds of neat stuff.
 Our dear James would not be complete without the old stand-bys back at British intelligence.  M, Bond's boss whom Dame Judi Dench plays with conviction and respect.  Even though it is obviously far beneath her talent, she never lets up for a moment.  Miss Moneypenny and a new face in R (John Cleese), Q's gadget guru apprentice.
 On a sad note, when you get the video, there is a tribute to Desmond Llewelyn who has been playing Q since 1963.  In the film, the retirement of Q is mentioned in the story, but sadly, Desmond Llewelyn passed away last year and the video tribute to him at the beginning of the video is touching and appropriate for a man who was so dedicated to a single character.  The storyline and plot gets a little muddled and confusing in a couple spots, mostly in favor of demonstrating some of the trademark cool Bond stuff instead.  If you're the kind of James Bond fan who enjoys the old standards, I don't think you'll be disappointed.  If you are the fan who wants to see something new, this isn't for you.
 I've got Dr. No and Goldfinger in my video cabinet.  I'm still waiting for a movie to top the ultimate good guy-villain exchange, ""Do you expect me to talk, Goldfinger?  No, Mr. Bond.  I expect you to die.""  I mean, how cool is that?  Cheesy and hip at the same time.  That's the James Bond genre, if you can get through all the double entendres without grimacing, you'll be OK.  The World Is Not Enough, in this case, the video is not enough.  If you haven't seen it yet, see it, but especially for the tribute to Desmond Llewelyn.",970531200,,4039,4.533980582524272
1078424,4,6305784906,"The World Is Not Enough is a good Bond film, but I remember having a better time in the theater watching A View To A Kill, a film that everybody seems to to trash but was never able to come up with an adequate reason to back up their claim.
TWINE opens up with a 13+ minute pre-title teaser (one of the main complaints I have with Brosnan's Bond is that the teaser is always soooo long) which have Bond in Spain before skipping to London, where Sir Robert King, a close friend of M, got blown uo with exploding money. It then seques onto a spectacular boat chase on the river Thames as Bond chases after the delectable Giulietta da Vinci (aka Cigar Girl), played by Maria Grazia Cucinotta. With pure Bondian logic, the river chase ended up on hotair balloon where Giulietta prefer suicide than to tell our hero who was the one who blew King up.
With King gone, Bond is convinced that Victor Zokov, aka Renard the Anarchist, who onced kidnapped King's daughter Elektra, is behind the assassination and is now after the bereaved daughter.
The rest of the movie have Bond trying to track down Renard, see what is he really up to, and find out if Elektra is really as innocent as she looks.
Overall, this is one of the few Bond films which actually delve deeper into some of the characters. But for every attempt at character development, something else misfires.
The scenes between Renard and Elektra are too melodramatic. It is an attempt to make the audience sympathize with the villain, with somehow it just sort of get....gooey, for lack of a better word. You might think that our villain would revel in the fact that he can't feel pain thanks to a bullet in his head. But no.... he bemoaned his fate like a Shakespearean character trapped in the wrong story.
While Elektra is well developed, Bond's other interest, Christmas Jones, is woefully underwritten and really does next to nothing. So she can disarm nuclear bombs, ironically in the movie, she didn't disarm a thing. Denise Richards is just not convincing as a nuclear physicist. What they needed was a older, more mature actress in the part.
Action wise, TWINE delivers, but there is something about the ski chase that seems tired and repetitive. Perhaps it is David Arnold's lackluster score. As for the caviar factory with the helicopter and the hanging buzzsaws, we have Bond running this way, that way, up and down..... why don't he just get the hell out of there?
The title-sequence, which centered around the oil motif started out great...but Daniel Kleinmann, unlike Maurice Binder before him, jam too much into the screen at once and you don't know where to look. Binder before him, have the audience concentrate on one image at a time.
Compare to all the dvd of other Bond films,the extra features on the TWINE Dvd is rather sparse. There are some trailers, an interview with Brosnan, and some other extras, like how the title sequence is shot, are included, but have no commentary.
Overall, TWINE is a pretty good picture, helped enormously by French actress Sophie Marceau. I just love that sick expression on her face when she took her earring off and reveal to Bond how psycho she can be. Robert Carlyle is okay as Renard, but I would much like it if they cut down on the melodrama. As for Brosnan, he shines as Bond. I hope he would make more. Three pictures are not enough.",970444800,2,3349,4.611390284757119
1078425,5,6305784906,Pierce is my favorite James Bond and this is my favorite film of his so far. I've been a bond fan since '77 and can't wait for the new film. Great soundtrack and great theme song by Garbage. I didn't care for the villian too much but the rest of the film makes up for him.,970358400,3,272,3.875
1078426,4,6305784906,"Infrequently in an action film series does one of its entries attempt to deal with the persona of its hero with equal intensity as it handles its plot. The director of this film tried to show how James Bond develops an obsession for a woman for whom he has become intrigued with, her having been mistreated by British Intelligence, and the effect it has on him. Unfortunately this idea never really comes satisfactorily to fruition, as the essential plot elements are not fully explored. They are forsaken at the expense of some unimaginative action sequences and a protracted additional love interest in the form of Dr. Christmas Jones. All that being said, Pierce Brosnan really has the part of James Bond down to an art and science despite the flaws in the script.",969926400,3,767,4.774436090225564
1078536,4,6305784906,"Okay, so it doesn't flow, but neither does this movie in many spots.  I love the Bond flicks, and Brosnan is easily the best, but he's weighted down by a story that starts out appropriately complex, but then becomes too complex for it's own good, with too many plans-within-plans, too many betrayals, and way too many explosions.
In this outer, Bond must protect a beautiful heiress, Elektra King, from a seemingly invincible and cold-blooded killer, Renard.  A bullet making its way through Renard's skull is slowly killling him, even as it renders him impervious to pain.  Elektra (Sophie Marceau), her father murdered in the first few minutes of TWINE, now stands ready to complete a monumental oil pipeline through the former Soviet central asia.  Because the pipeline will assure the west's energy needs through the next century, and with competing projects underway in Russia, both it and Elektra become prime targets.  But all is not it seems, as Bond learns with a bang.
Unfortunately, much of TWINE seems that way, with Bond uncovering a plot just in time for it to prove a cover for something darker.  Usually, the revelation comes with the appropriate explosion, so, by the time the real climax occurs, we're already too punch-drunk to notice or even care.  the only hint of a structure is the standard formula with Bond falling into bed with every beautfiful woman he meets, and action sequences that seem to run out of sync with the script.  Enjoyable fun, but I preferred ""Goldeneye"".",969494400,3,1498,4.916666666666667
1078537,4,6305784906,"This is the first time I made myself watch a Bond movie with Pierce Brosnan - 'cause usually I don't like him, he is not macho enough to play  that role. But I was surprised. Even tough he does look too old and  unattractive and lacks charm, he does play pretty alright.
The story  itself is the usual Bond stuff, and even though you know 007 is gonna get  through, the makers of The World Is Not Enough have managed to throw in  some really exciting scenes.
James Bond movies still seems the only  successfull way to combine action, humour and beautiful chicks!",968198400,,562,4.407766990291262
1078538,4,6305784906,"It must be hard to write/star in a Bond film. There are so many expectations to live up to. Connery does not help - setting the standard so  high with the earlier Bond flicks. Bronson will always deliver as bond. His  supporting cast- Marceau and Carlyle are equally good. The actress who  plays Christmas Jones is laughable. She is so wrong for the part, you wish  she had stayed home. The plot - not bad- classic Bond, with the fate of the  world at stake. I liked it becasue there is always room for a good action  film, with no indecent language and (dare I say) excessive violence. Bond  delivers. The ending though could use some work - exactly how many Bond  films end with Bond kissing the girl? I should know - since I have seen  them all.",967248000,2,748,4.323741007194244
1078539,4,6305784906,"This is a good film, at least from the perspective of a big Bond fan like myself, but it just wasn't what it could have been.  After seeing Goldeneye  and TND I thought of Brosnan as the best Bond since Connery, but here he is  starting to seem bored with the role and not giving all that he did  previously.  I also expected more from director Michael Apted.  When I saw  his name, I thought we would be getting an emotional, human Bond like in  Licence to Kill, but with Brosnan's style and wit.  This was atempted, but  not as successfully as in LtK (it still beats the overly cartooniness of  some of the Moore films, though).  Then there's Christmas Jones (Denise  Richards), the most poorly drawn Bond girl since Holly Goodhead, and I must  say Richards acting ability hasn't improved since Starship Troopers (at  least there the acting was supposed to be bad).  Fortunutly, the film is  saved by the other Bond girl, Electra (Sophie Marceau).  She is the best  character of that type in a while.  There is also a much more active role  for M, a treat for Judi Dench fans.  Sadly, this is the last apperence of  Q, but he is replaced by John Cleese, which pleases me considering I'm as  much of a Monty Python fan as I am a James Bond fan.  Of course it won't be  the same without Desmond Llewelyn.  When it comes to the the plot, villian,  etc. this film rates about average with the other 18.
Like the film, the  disc is good but disapointing.  It ranks fairly high when compaired to the  average dvd, but it doesn't hold up to the other James Bond special edition  discs.  It does have a great transfer and it is the only disc in wave 2 to  have two commentary tracks, but thats about it.  The  ""documentary"" is mearly a 15 minute promotional featurette - pure  fluff.  There is also ""Secrets of 007"", which is not to be  confused with the 45 minute series retrospectives found on the other two  Brosnan discs.  It is instead similar to the ""follow the white  rabbit"" feature on the Matrix dvd.  It's nice, but the segments go by  too quickly to be informative.  The material would have worked better in a  real documentary, like on the other Bond SE's.  Besides for that, there is  the music video and trailer.  As I said, its a nice disc and worth buying  if your a fan of the series, but it pales in comparison to the other discs  released to promote it.",967248000,,2366,4.361111111111111
1078540,2,6305784906,"I thought this film, although seeming to have all the right elements of a Bond film, just didn't have any ""spark"".  Pierce Brosnen is a  fantastic Bond so he isn't the problem...and even the story was Bond-esque,  so that wasn't it.  Adding John Cleese was a stroke of brilliance!  He was  the brightest spot in the film and who ever thought of casting him in this  hopefully reccurring roll was absolutely right on the money!  The film  seemed overly long to me and there were even a few times when I was sure it  was over only to (groan inwardly)find  that it wasn't.  I rented this at  the video store and felt compelled to watch it and get my moneys worth but  to tell you the truth, had it been on TV I probably would have switched to  a re-run of Gilligan's Island.  All the Bond film elements were presant in  this film but for me this film just didn't ""click""...wait for it  to come on TV.",966988800,4,897,4.269461077844311

I was so pleased with it then before! Now it  is my favorite Brosnan 007. This movie is great! Lots of action, good bond  girls and an excellent plot that requires 2 viewings to get completly.

1078542,4,6305784906,"In the wake of the excellent Special Edition treatments that previous Bond  movies have enjoyed, this ""Ultimate Special Edition"" DVD of TWINE  is somewhat of a let-down in comparison.  Don't get me wrong, TWINE is a  very good Bond movie, with an interesting--albeit labrynthine--plot, great  stunt sequences, beautiful Bond women, and excellent character development.  Brosnan continues to give us a Bond that is an amalgamation of all of the  best characteristics of his predecessors, with a bit of his own, suave  style thrown in for good measure.  He keeps getting better with every film,  and dare I say, one day, he may supplant Connery as the consummate Bond.  The transfer of this film to DVD is pristine, continuing in MGM's tradition  of providing excellent DVD transfers.  But, as mentioned earlier, this disc  is relatively feature-poor.  While the other Special Edition Bond films  included multiple trailers, numerous TV spots, a couple of 45-minute  documentaries, and photo galleries, the TWINE DVD merely scrapes by with  only one trailer, a short, 15-minute documentary, and a series of alternate  video tracks (which are quite interesting).  That's it: no TV spots, no  longer documentaries, no photos.  It seems odd to me that while TWINE was  produced in the days of feature-loaded DVD, they were not able to scrape  together any more extra materials than they could for movies made 40 years  ago, when ""home entertainment"" was a radio and a warm fire.  To  get really nit-picky, the collectible booklet contains entirely preventable  typos, and the titling on the spine is white, instead of the shades of gold  that grace the covers of the other Bond special editions.  All told, the  film itself is excellent and not to be missed, but this DVD treatment pales  in comparison to the other Bond releases.",966470400,3,1825,5.0608108108108105

1078671,3,6305784906,"The latest James Bond opus, `The World is Not Enough,' makes for reasonably diverting escapist fare, provided, of course, one is not too  discriminating in one's moviegoing demands. Bursting at the seams with the  usual array of high-tech gadgetry and elaborate action stunts (including a  spectacular pre-credit boat chase along the majestic Thames), the film once  again stars Pierce Brosnan as the intrepid secret agent 007, undergoing a  myriad of hairbreadth escapes as he makes the world safe for the democratic  forces of the Western world.
The quality of any Bond flick must be  measured by how well it fulfills several basic requirements: the quality of  its stunts, the level of its wit, the beauty of its women, the creativity  of its gadgets and the cleverness of its storyline. `The World is Not  Enough' fulfills most of these prerequisites fairly well although much of  the humor - except for some scenes early on involving Q - falls miserably  flat with the allegedly clever quips and one liners eliciting far more  groans than laughs. The story itself, though it sputters at points, always  seems to right itself at crucial moments. As always, profusion often leads  to confusion as more and more characters are introduced then dispatched  before we have had time to register exactly who they are or what part they  play in the proceedings. However, the writers and director Michael Apted  have provided a solid core around which to build their narrative: the  character of Elektra, played winningly by Sophie Marceau, the daughter of  an oil tycoon, who provides us, first, with a focal point of humanity and  sympathy and, then later on, one of ruthlessness and villainy. Rendered  enigmatic by her dual qualities of warm vulnerability and icy cold  malevolence, she turns her every interaction with Bond into a fascinating  duel of wills and wits. That is far more than can be said for the other  major female figure in the cast, Christmas Jones, the nuclear physicist  with the aerobics-instructor body, who, next to Elektra, looks even more  inane and insipid than that description sounds.
As to the hardware and  the stunts, they, as usual, cannot be faulted in their imaginativeness and  technical proficiency, but the unending parade of ear-splitting explosions  and gun battles does begin to grow a bit wearying during the overlong 128  minute course of the film. Some judicious editing would certainly have  helped in tightening up the proceedings somewhat.
`The World is Not  Enough' must, finally, be adjudged a success or failure based on one's love  or disdain for the Bond series. Those with no strong feelings either way  will find themselves relatively entertained by the movie's assortment of  stunts and actions and positively enthralled by the riveting performance of  Ms. Marceau - which is about all one can reasonably ask from a film of this  nature.",965692800,6,2890,5.044491525423729

First, the story is serious and dark, but filled with  built-in action set pieces that mostly  (except for the parachute snowmobiles) fit right in and don't seem too  contrived. I was especially imressed that the finale wasn't a routine  shootout in the villian's secret fortress.  Second, the villians are  tragic and developed rather than the usual egomaniacal billionaire. They  are carefully written and add much to the depth of the film.  Third, there  are several supporting roles that are well-played and written, especially  Dame Judy Dench as M. The plucky Christmas Jones character is fun, and adds  a nice contrast to the silky Electra King.  Do I need to mention that  Pierce Brosnan is an excellent Bond? He really embodies Bond's  essence-sauve, sexy, and very dangerous.  Finally, the film is  beautifully shot and directed. Too many of the 70's and 80's Bonds looked  they were directed by committee.

Whenever she  opened her mouth, bad lines, along with bad acting, would spill out.  The  only reason she was in the film was because of her sweat body.  Her roll in  the film detracted from the films seriousness and, I my opinion, ranks  ""The World is Not Enough"" as the number 2 Bond stinker right  after ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" with George Lazenby.

Pierce Brosnan delivers another excellent performance as  James Bond, by now second only to Sean Connery himself. Neal Purvis, Robert  Wade and Bruce Feirstein have crafted an excellent screenplay that seems  reminscent of some of the earlier, less action-driven Bond movies. Garbage  provides one of the greatest Bond theme songs ever, and Michael Apted  brings it all together almost perfectly. Not everything is perfect of  course; the action sequences near the end are somewhat chaotic, John Cleese  is hard to swallow as R, and Sophie Marceau's near perfect physical and  dramatic performance leaves Denise Richards looking foolish.

The spectacular beginning action sequence is a knockout and a perfect way to blast off this impressive Bond entry. The film advances at a steady pace  and is filled with tongue-in-cheek humor. The ravishing Sophie Marceau is a  memorable Bond Girl and is certainly the best in the Brosnan Bonds, she's  everything a man could ask for; beautiful, exotic and seductive but lethal.  The voluptuously beautiful Denise Richards is also great, more Americanized  than Marceau but also impressive. Even though she doesn't have the looks  for a Dr. specialist in nuclear physics but she is attractive and that's  the most important thing for a Bond Girl even though it couldn't hurt for  them to have personality and smarts. John Cleese of 'Monty Python' fame  appears as 'R' who replaces the late Desmond Llewelyn who appeared as 'Q'  in 19 Bond films. There's a skiing action sequence that could remotely  compare to the one in 'The Spy Who Loved Me'. Robert Carlyle who played it  nice in 'The Full Monty' maked for a lethal villain here even though the  excellent premise of a man who could not feel pain is not fully  appreciated. The last action sequence is a bit of a letdown and the way the  villain dies is wholly unoriginal and disappointing.

But the list stops there.  Why, oh why did they pick Denise Richards as a nuclear physicist of all  things!  She even challenges Talisa Soto(LICENSE TO KILL)as worst Bond  girl.  I would have liked to have seen Denise and Sophie exchange roles.  Then they would have been much better suited for each other.
The opening  sequence involving the boat chase was excellent!, as was the introduction  to ""R"".  As Skiing sequences go in Bond movies, this one was OK,  but my fave is still where this film gets its title- ON HER MAJESTY'S  SECRET SERVICE.
I was glad to see Coltrane back- and loved the leg joke  he did on Bond later on!  Carlyle turned out a good performance too, but  wasn't in the movie as much as I thought he would be.  he turned out to be  more of a pawn to Elektra.
The BMW seemed to be there just for show this  time, and was only used once for gadgets, which is, lets face it, what we  want to see.
As for the DVD extras, I liked the explanations of the  stunts, similar to the ""Follow the white rabbit"" on The Matrix  DVD, and the Making of TWINE could have been a little longer, IMHO.  The  other Makings of... were much better made.  Anything by Shirley Manson and  garbage is always welcome by me!  Two things- One is no English  subtitles(same as on the majority of The James Bond Gift Set 2).  This gets  to me because when I have the commentary option on, I like to know what's  going on in the movie, and subtitles is the only way.  Secondly- as it is  with all Bond DVDs, there are no bios on the main characters.  I think this  would make a great addition.

1078762,5,6305784906,"The World Is Not Enough is the best, most original Bond movie to be released since For Your Eyes Only, and is one of the best ever made.  While I admit that the Bonds do have a rather formulaic approach, and that this  can restrain the creativity of the actors and directors, that approach is  the reason that Bond is the most successful movie character of all time -  if you don't like the formula, then don't watch James Bond!
That said,  TWINE is an excellent movie.  The plot is original and pertinent to today's  world.  The acting is exceptional for a Bond film (except for the rather  too bland Denise Richards).

1078768,5,6305784906,"My thoughts on this abomination of a movie are well known, but they were recently reinforced -
I saw the terrible ""Casino Royale"" (1967) again this past weekend....You know, I managed to sit through it, which is something that I cannot manage to do with TWINE....That tells me that IMO ""The World is Not Enough"" is worse than the unfunny spoof ""Casino Royale""....It is not only the worst Bond movie ever but it probably ranks as one of the worst ""action"" (I use the term loosely because there's hardly any of it in this travesty) movies of the last 30 years.

I haven't been able to sit through TWINE since I saw it the first night it was out in the movie theater. I almost walked out in disgust then too...I promised a friend of mine (who will remain nameless) that I would try and sit through it a couple of months back but I failed...I simply don't like it. Really, after the boat chase it slips into melodrama and never recovers. It is the most boring non-fun movie of the franchise.

- It was boring and they turned James Bond into a Nancy-boy.
- The action setpieces seemed artificial and forced - they lacked the flow evident in earlier movies. The parahawk sequence is a prime example of what was wrong with TWINE's action, it was stilted and lackluster (not helped by a terrible Arnold score). The only action sequence that worked on any level was the boat chase.
- Denise Richards as Christmas Jones was the Stacey Sutton of the Brosnan era (but without the knock-out looks, sorry Finesse).
- Pierce Brosnan seemed to sleepwalk his way through the part delivering his worst performance as James Bond (his best still being his excellent turn as 007 in GE).
- A lackluster screenplay with more twists and turns than a pretzel, none of which were interesting or particularly well explained.
- The worst finale of any Bond movie....who really cared.
- ""I thought Christmas only came once a year"" -- the whole theater groaned, no one laughed or even chuckled.
- Elektra as a villain was telegraphed way too early.
- They used another flipping gadget car. Prior to Brosnan we had gadget cars in 1964, 1965, 1977 and 1987. They used to be special now they are commonplace marketing which ever newest vehicle of the company that dished out the most dough.
- David Arnold used the James Bond theme too much, the only track that he scored a home run on was during the boat chase.",962928000,,2379,4.543123543123543

However  all good things must come to an end. I've drawn an opinion that Mr. Cleese  will do well to succeed; certainly not replace.
I had heard it said  before, but I didn't realize this till after the credits were rolling: This  IS the best Bond ever. Ever. No doubts about it.  As usual, there is no  want for excitement. Again the script comes through on the action, and  Brosnan does no less a spectacular job delivering his performance. Also as  usual, that delivery is in what has become his cool and suave way that  makes every man inspired to be that cool under pressure.

1078932,4,6305784906,"The World Is Not Enough is a substantial improvement over the disappointing Tomorrow Never Dies, bringing back the personal score-settling aspect that made Goldeneye a breakthrough in the Bond  saga.
By now Pierce Brosnan, Dame Judi Dench, and company have come into  their own in their roles and it shows in the greater polish shown in their  performances.  Sadly, the film turned out to be the last for Desmond  Llywellen as Q - the film also introduces Q's understudy, R, played by John  Cleese.
The film's score also brings back the lush sweep that made John  Barry's scores such a big part of the Bond mystique.
Normally the  prologue introduces the premise and/or a major character.  Here, though,  the prologue begins the actual story in earnest, as the recovery of ransom  money by James turns into a deadly trap for billionaire oil magnate Robert  King.  When MI6 HQ is thus destroyed, James chases a woman assigned to  finish the job, and is injured when she blows herself up rather than  surrender.
MI6 quickly deduces that it is the work of terrorist Renard  (Robert Carlyle), a killer with a bullet lodged in his brain severing his  ability to feel pain, which thus makes him physically stronger and more  dangerous.  James must protect Robert King's daughter Elecktra (Sophie  Marceau, who smolders throughout the film like no Bond girl before since  You Only Live Twice's Number 11), and this reunites him with old nemesis  Valentin Zukovsky (Robbie Coltraine).  The return of Valentin is welcome,  and the interplay between James and Valentin is outstanding, particularly  when James corners Valentin at gunpoint later in the film.
Through  Valentin James learns of Renard's hideout, an abandoned Soviet ICBM site  whose dismantling is supervised by shapely scientist Christmas Jones  (Denise Richards in a mixed-bag performance).  But there Renard manages to  escape, and in the process James begins to suspect he is being  doublecrossed.  His suspicions prove true when Renard plants a motorized  nuclear bomb in a pipeline near the Caspian Sea.  James and Christmas  succeed in disarming the nuclear portion of the bomb, but James has the  rest of the explosive go off, thus faking their deaths.  This allows him to  interrogate Valentin and learn the shocking truth about Renard and an  inside man on his side.
The action comes faster and fiercer than usual  throughout, and the characterization throughout is unusually good.",961977600,,2445,5.075757575757576
1078933,4,6305784906,"This is a James Bond movie.  That explains pretty much the whole movie - you know you're getting girls, gimmicks, and lots of explosions and stunts.  This one seems to to better than the average Bond.  Brosnan has brought a  greater degree of ferocity to the part, more like Sean Connery.  The best  part for me is that it looks good - unlike most action movies today, there  is very little computer animation (one computer animated part looks  terribly phoney (the flying sawblades) by contrast with all the real stunts  and explosions).  I also liked the interaction between Bond and the  pseudo-badguys, meaning the criminals in the movie who aren't the main bad  guys that Bond uses to help him out, another proud tradition from the early  Bonds.
The plot is a little murky (sort of like Cruise's Mission:  Impossible), but it doesn't really detract from the movie.  If you like  Bond, you should like this film.
As for the DVD edition itself, there are  a ton of extras: (1) the director's commentary is quite good, if a little  dry; some neat insight into what he was doing with each scene and why (2)  the 2nd commentary (prod. designer, 2nd unit director, and composer) wasn't  as good - seemed like they didn't really prepare anything, just sat around  and yacked, thus it is not very useful; additionally the composer talked  about the music in particular scenes, but with the movie soundtrack  completely removed, you couldn't remember the music he was talking about,  so not very useful.  (3) the ""secrets of Bond"" clips you could  cut to in the middle of the movie would have been more interesting if there  was a little commentary about how things were done, rather than a big  visual montage with pounding music. (4) The making of segment was only okay  - the interviewer was a ditz.
All in all, with the extras and the  enjoyment of the film, this is a very good DVD.",961977600,,1883,4.635258358662614
1078934,5,6305784906,"For James Bond film fans--well, what can you say?  Bond is back in this latest of the genre's thrillers and Pierce Brosnan as the unflappable 007 is at his best!
 In ""The World Is not Enough,"" it's action, more action,  and even more action!  This Bondian entry moves fast and furious, almost as  if the director (Michael Apted) was afraid that if he slowed down, the  audience would depart!
 Not so, this viewer!  Brosnan seems to have  the kinks worked out and appears more relaxed (and better coifed!)--perhaps  he feels now that Connery  and Moore are not lurking over his shoulders!  He doesn't have to worry about unnatural comparisons!
 And where  would any Bond film be without exotic (and erotic!) locations.  Following a  dizzying opening sequence in London, the climactic action switches  to  one of the former USSR states and the development of a mega-oil pipeline  deal!  Therein lies the rub!  Naturally, it's a global takeover of the  world's oil market  and our current baddie, Renard, a sly fox of an  antagonist (he can feel no pain), is taking no prisoners in his bid to rule  the world (Renard is ably played by Robert Caryle of ""The Full Monty fame).  It is going to take all the talent that 007 possesses if he is to emerge  the winner of this tryst!
 Of course, we are honored with the  presence of Judi Dench (who seems to have found a permanent role as the new  M) and roly-poly Robbie Coltrane chimes in with a good performance.  Naturally, a Bond film cannot be without its ritual ""femme fatale""--and  this lady's fatal, rest assured (mourning does not become Elektra here).  Of course, her evilness is offset by James' romantic interest du film!
  All in all, it's a frolicking, rollicking 007 film.  Bond aficionados will  appreciate this one--and if you're not a Bond fan.  Well, there's always  ""There's Something About Mary"" or ""Titanic.""

This is the 19th - YES 19th Bond film, where the formula is the  same as always. Opening pre-title sequence, Bond villain, Bond babes, Bond  car, Bond gadgets, Bond/Q argument, cheesy Bond puns, Bond car/plane  chases...it's all there. But the trouble is, it's the same as it was last  time. And the time before that. And the time before THAT. You see, we're  tired of hearing the same convoluted world-domination plans, tired of Bond  relentlessly sleeping with every woman in range. It's time for something  fresh. But do we get it? No. Same garbled plans. Same sex. There isn't a  drop of originality in the film. First the bad guy, Renard. Not a bad  performance from Robert Carlyle, but he doesn't appear for 45 mins - maybe  an hour. And he is little more than a henchmen to Sophie Marceau's villain,  daughter of an oil executive, who's annoyed that he didn't pay her kidnap  ransom, so she had him killed and now wants to take over the oil industry  by detonating a nuclear bomb and wiping out all oil pipelines except her  own. RUBBISH. Who writes this nonsense? The plots have always been silly,  but never THIS silly. Back to Renard. He can't feel pain (it's the movie  equivalent of lepricy, brought about by a VERY unlikely bullet-wound), but  never uses this wisely. He COULD survive explosions, jump out of buildings  etc. No. He bangs his hand through a table, and gets hit a few times.  BORING. Sophie Marceau's villain gets sillier as the film progresses, until  her well deserved demise. Denise Richards is the back-up (and superfluous)  Bond babe, who Bond quickly does the business with the moment Marceau is  out of the way (oh, that's love. Yeah, RIGHT...). Judy Dench is atleast  given a lot to do as M, and the late (great) Desmond Llwellyn does a nice  exit as Q (ably replaced by John Cleese). Pierce Brosnan does the usual  smirks as Bond, but the character has become rather tired recently (as has  the forumla). The opening theme (sung by Garbage - appropriate name  considering the film attatched) is dreary and slow. Nothing compared to  Tina Turner's Goldeneye. Everything about this film - even the visuals,  which range from mildly nice to downright dull - is tired, formulaic and  unoriginal. It's not worth bothering with, unless you're a very committed  Bond fan with little else to do. Oh, the opening sequence is far too long,  Robbie Coltrane gets killed and John Cleese's guest spot as ""R""  (oh ha ha) barely stretches beyond a minute. On the whole, a cheap, cheesy,  uninspired, poorly written and formula-reliant clone of the Bond theme,  with few twists or turns, and a totally predictable turn of events  throughout.

But of course are  there still the ingredients we we usually see in a Bond movie: the great  woman, the humor, the great stunts, the Bond gadgets, the Bond car and of  course the villain.  And it has a very good story!
""The World is Not  Enough"" is for everyone who loves (or just likes) James Bond a must  see! But though this movie is very good, for me is ""Tomorrow Never  Dies"" still the best James Bond movie ever made.",961804800,,701,4.3307692307692305

It's a good formula that it is dangerous to alter.  Look at the  Timoty Dalton Bond movies.  Dalton made Bond a misty-eyed, sensitive and  vulnerable soul.  Oops!  Brosnan's third shot finds him hitting his stride  and finding all the right notes.  Sean Connery is the ideal Bond, being the  first.  Here Brosnan rediscovers the toughness and ruthlessness of Connery  in ""Dr. No.""  He is nearly as suave as Connery and comes close to  matching Connery's overwhelming confidence.

1079046,4,6305784906,"The World is Not Enough is probably the best James Bond movie since 1977's  The Spy Who Loved Me.  It has the best action scenes (the opening sequence  is the best by far in the series), the best girl (Sophie Marceau, NOT  Denise Richards), and the best villain (an impervious-to-pain adversary).
The first forty-five minutes of the film are completely original  (something that has diminished from the 007 franchise).  In fact, it's the  smartest 007 to date, finally using the special effects and actually using  some wit to make the villain interesting.  Afterwards though, right at the  start of the ski-chase scene, we see the same old stuff from the Spy Who  Loved Me, A View to a Kill, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, etc. and the  finale aboard a submarine, reminiscent of the Spy Who Loved Me, Tomorrow  Never Dies and a few scenes in For Your Eyes Only.  Nonetheless, what a  refreshing feeling it is to see Brosnan enjoying himself as Bond.  This is,  like I said, the best 007 film in over twenty years, and I am betting it is  because of this guy--the best Bond since Connery.
Sophie Marceau is  extremely impressive as the heiress whom Bond must protect (and later doing  some extra ciricular activities with, unsurprisingly), but Denise Richards  as Christmas Jones is totally outrageous. She displays dumb-as-a-post  dialogue and a performance to go with it, and by now you guys out there are  saying, ""What? Why not, she's a fox!""  Well, the truth is yes she  is, but I've seen Wild Things and that was impressive enough.  She was  definitely better than Teri Hatcher in Tomorrow Never Dies, that's for  sure.
The theme song, sung by Garbage, is also the best theme since the  Spy Who Loved Me.  For Your Eyes Only, Moonraker and Tomorrow Never Dies  were all good theme songs but this one stands out above them and being  surpassed only by Carly Simon's song.  Paul McCartney's Live and Let Die  and Goldfinger's themes are superb, also.
For some unknown reason this  film's extras are not that impressive when compared to the rest of the  series'.  Yes, there are two audio commentaries but first they have to be  interesting before you can sit for two hours listening to how they did this  or that.  Then there's a little cheapskate try at a documentary, and  running at only 15 minutes is only a third long as the rest of the  documentaries of the other series discs.  So you are mainly only looking at  the film when you buy this disc, but the commentaries are good depending on  how interested you are in the film, which is strongly enough recommended as  it is.

We all know that Bond kills the bad guy in a confrontation at the end of the  movie.  In my opinion, Renard should not have been the ultimate bad guy.  He was a follower of the true evil person in the film and Renard should  have been wasted before taking on the true bad guy.  Making this change  would have been very unique and it would have made for a different kind of  showdown.
Marceau and Carlysle are great in their roles.  Richards was  their for show only.  I liked this movie, but still long for ones in the  less if your face style of for your eyes only and from russia with love.",961459200,,731,4.1063829787234045
1079149,3,6305784906,"""The World Is Not Enough"" is NOT Shakesperian drama, folks...it's a James Bond movie, and it works almost as well as some of the better Bond films of the past.
Give the filmmakers credit for trying to  delve into the characters in Bond's life (particularly the villanous  Elektra, who is the most memorable Bond girl in years), but ultimately a  Bond movie is about what you'd expect Bond movies to be about...action.  ""The World Is Not Enough"" delivers on this level, though one  wonders how many more ways Bond can Blow Things Up Real Good.
The worst  aspect of the movie had to be Denise Richards as Dr. Christmas Jones (yes,  you know her name will be made into a pun from the moment you meet her,  which it is). While undeniably gorgeous, Richards has a major problem - she  can't act, which makes her character the dumbest-sounding nuclear physicist  ever.
""The World Is Not Enough"" is highly entertaining, and  Pierce Brosnan is undeniably a very good Bond. But simply because we learn  a bit more about some of Bond's co-workers, don't expect some indie-flick  character study; Bond is going to blow things up real good, and look real  good doing it.
And THAT is the reason we pay to see him.",961113600,6,1200,4.599056603773585
1079150,5,6305784906,This is an excellent entry into the James Bond movie franchise. Pierce Brosnon is great as James Bond and the action sequences are great especially the motorboat chase. The women are sexy but Denise Richards  doesn't do a real good acting job in this movie but she sure is nice to  look at. The bad guy does a good job too but I wish he was a little more  menacing. The plot is pretty good with a few twists and surprises. Highly  recommend this movie and Tomorrow Never Dies and Goldeneye.,961113600,,490,4.351648351648351
1079151,3,6305784906,"Actually, the fact that early in this movie 007 injures his back should be a clue that he's not going to be up to his old standards in this movie. Many people have said that they think that this newest Bond movie,  ""The World Is Not Enough"", is good. It's not particularly bad- it  just isn't up to previous standards set.
The plot, while fairly  simplistic, was still hard to follow, and at times you couldn't understand  who was the bad guy, or why. It would have helped had they developed the  characters more- then you might have had more insight into the entire  development of the plot. The special effects and stunts were fairly good,  as always, but they weren't as memorable as many of the famous scenes from  other movies (such as the jump off the dam in Goldeneye). Sadly, the former  Q made an exit, which is definitely a disappointment- however, I guess that  fans will just have to live with it. I must say, though, that ""R""  certainly doesn't seem nearly as cool as Q, whom he replaced.
If you are  a long time Bond fan that sees all of his movies, you probably won't mind  any of these problems very much. However, you should probably think twice  about seeing this movie if you aren't really a fan- you could probably find  a better way to spend your evening.",961113600,,1276,4.416309012875536

Just stand there getting wet in that white t-shirt.  That's  probably the only reason the director casted her for after her  ""Wildthings"" movie.  Sophie Marceau was fantastic!

  The movie was cool. it was a  shame Valentin had to be killed. He was cool. It starts out with Bond  delivering money to a rich man (as usual in spy movies), and the mans  little pin ends up killing him. SO bond is trying to do multiple things at  the same time, save the world, find out who the insider is, why do they  want to destroy the world, and all that stuff.
The action is okay, i  wasn't blown away with the special effects because i honestly couldn't see  any, or if there was i couldn't see them because they were so good. There  is a good action scene at a Boat dock which is a caviare factory. The ski  chase was a little short, and weak. The nuclear plant was awesome, which  was the only time Pierce really blows a few heads off with a machine gun.  The opening boat scene was cool, but there seemed to be things exploding  because a little piece of wood hits a barrel, or they collide with  something.

The film is ""Bondonian"". That good old  ""love it or hate it"" point. I love it, but his edition is not as  good as others in the series. The DVD extras are shorter. Not the place to  save, Warner.",960595200,,723,4.507692307692308
1079240,3,6305784906,"After two outstanding entries (""Goldeneye"" and ""Tomorrow Never Dies"") in the James Bond series, Pierce Brosnan's third going, ""The World is Not Enough,"" is certainly ambitious in acting and  characterization.  Bond exhibits a dark and (generally) amoral streak  throughout the movie; there are at least two people that he kills in  instances that would have been shocking in most other Bond movies with the  possible exception of the early Sean Connery ones.
No doubt director  Michael Apted had something to do with the deeper layers of  characterization; Apted previously directed the ""7-Up""  documentary series, as well as the ambitious (but disappointing)  ""Thunderheart.""
The set pieces throughout ""The World is  Not Enough"" are terrific, ranging from a boat chase through London, a  ski sequence involving ""para-hawks,"" a long sequence at a  refinery dock with giant circular saw blade armed helicopters, and numerous  brutal gunfights and fistfights.  Brosnan reportedly did many of his own  stunts, and indeed, Bond is more spectacularly violent here than in recent  films.
The biggest problem with the movie (aside from the inherent  laughable premise of Denise Richards as a nuclear physicist) is that too  much of it makes no sense.  Now it may be that I've been dumbed down by too  many movies, but there were multiple instances while watching this that  Bond would struggle to take some action and I would be left wondering why  he was doing what he was doing.  At 2 hours and 8 minutes, the movie may  have been as long as the studio would have allowed it to be, but one gets  the sense that another five minutes or so scattered throughout might have  helped make things make more sense.
Equally problematic is the fact that  the villain, who is described as being impervious to pain due to the  lodging of a bullet near his brain, goes around doing things like grasping  hot coals in his hand.  Sure, maybe he wouldn't feel any pain, but his hand  should still be burned and structurally damaged.  That sort of damage  should affect his ability to grasp objects (like guns) and affect his  ability to use his hands (for things like shooting guns).
Finally, a note  on the special features of the DVD.  The DVD proudly advertises its  ""video options,"" allowing you to catch behind the scene looks of  certain scenes.  Those of you who own ""The Matrix"" on DVD will  think that this is similar to the ""Follow the White Rabbit""  feature on that disc.  Indeed, at designated scenes in ""The World is  Not Enough,"" a white ""007"" flashes on the screen.  If you  hit the ""Enter"" button on your DVD remote, you get whisked to a  behind the scenes look.
However, this feature is VASTLY inferior to that  on ""The Matrix.""  Most of the behind the scenes look is simply a  pan-and-scan view of the movie, with a few seconds of videotaped glances of  the shooting of the scene.  There is very little display of how the scene  was filmed, and nothing as extensive as the rehearsal scenes and other  technical details in ""The Matrix.""  I wouldn't not buy the DVD  because of this, but I wouldn't have high expectations for that special  feature.",960595200,,3143,4.804511278195489

Not a bit of interesting action to be found in this hackneyed  piece of garbage.  In fact the action sequences don't even flow well.  The  director, Apted, needs to turn in his DGA card because this thing had the  sloppiest direction of any Bond film in memory.

1079243,4,6305784906,"I enjoyed this movie but a few things bothered me.  I think Denise Richards is a beautiful woman but she's not convincing enough as a top nuclear scientist.  Sophie Marceau is sexy and does a good job.  I don't  know too much about Robert Carlyle but he did well as a villain.  Seeing  Judi Dench as M was very cool but it's not so much the fault with the  acting it's the plot.
It's good but it didn't have the ""OOMF""  that I usually get from previous Bond films.  Oh, the action and effects  were top notch and you can see so in the secrets segment of the DVD but the  goal for the producers was to see a new side of Bond.  Thus they selected  Michael Apted to direct the film.  His previous movies were not action.  They were good movies such as ""Coal Miner's Daughter"",  ""Gorillas in the Midst"" and ""Nell"".  Three very cool  movies but non-action.  It was a bold move.  I guess we are treated with a  side of James Bond that we are not used to seeing.  A Bond that shows his  rage.  Is something new, something good?  Either way, I enjoyed the movie  and it's very good and different from the others.  Maybe another woman as a  nuclear scientist and not a young 20+ year old?  I guess I'm used to seeing  older women as Bond's ladies and not someone so young but it's OK.  Denise  Richards is very beautiful and she's a talented actress.
First, let's  discuss the audio and video.  The audio is great and at first I questioned  about the surround in the early beginning but then I started to hear the  surround later on.  I was expecting a lot more through the boat scenes in  terms of audio but throughout the movie, the sound becomes prominent.  The  audio is well done throughout the film and is a good highlight for this  DVD.  The video is pretty good and MGM did a great job.  I don't think I  recall seeing any artifacts and no horrendous switch to the new layer.  It's anamorphic, so be happy!
As for the DVD, The menu is done really  well, interactive, computer generated and very nice.  Similar to the  MATRIX DVD where you can see how they created some scenes in the movie,  this DVD allows you to see ""The Secrets of 007"" where if you see  the 007, with a press on your remote, you can access the making of certain  scenes and see the storyboards which is nice.  The GARBAGE music video for  ""The World is not Enough"" is pretty cool.  I always felt she is a  freaky woman, I like their music but she's freaky.  The video is very cool  and they must of spent a lot of money on it.  For commentary freaks, you  get two.  One from the director and the other from the production designer,  unit director and composer.  Also, the booklet included is pretty cool but  booklets would be nice if they included it on the DVD as well.
Welcome  to a new Bond and a chance to share the psyche of the agent known as 007.  A very good DVD but a new side of Bond that I was not easily open to but it  was a pretty damn good movie.",960336000,6,2931,4.182640144665461

Although unbelievable as a  nuclear scientist, Dr. Christmas Jones makes for a very stunning Bond babe.

1079245,4,6305784906,"The World Is Not Enough is a solid entry in the near 40-year-old franchise.  After two decent outings in the role, Pierce Brosnan is finally given a film where he can showcase the numerous qualities which make Bond a  great hero, even today: dry wit, elegant sophistication, and a cold-blooded  lethality which has been absent in the series for a long time.  Brosnan is  secure and confident this time around, and the film does for him what  ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" did for Roger Moore. The film has what is  perhaps the best (and longest) pre-credit sequence in the history of the  series.  It has a fantastic character in Elektra (played with a natural  sensuality by Sophie Marceau).  Most surprisingly, it gives Judy Dench  something more to do than just sit around in her office, briefing Bond  about his latest mission. The film also marks the last appearance of  ""Q"" (wonderfully played by Desmond Llewellyn for over 35 years),  and passes on the torch to John Cleese in a most humorous fashion.  The  welcome return of Robbie Coltrane as a reoccuring character from  ""GoldenEye,"" is also one of the film's high points. The film's  greatest strength is perhaps the rare attention to actual drama that the  series has unfortunately been inconsistent with.  The best Bond films (From  Russia With Love, Goldfinger, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Licence To  Kill) have payed close attention to this element, and this one is all the  much better for it. The only disappointing features in the DVD are the  inclusion of only one trailer, and the lack of the Desmond Llewellyn  tribute, which inexplicably, the VHS version includes.

The character of Elektra was  not only predictable but boring, and Denise Richards as a nuclear  physicist, one can only wonder who comes up with that sort of rubbish.  The  bad puns in the movie were over kill.

The DVD is nicely done, though it would have  been nice to have deleted scenes (I'm sure they exsist) in there. It's a  Bond film, but after the gadgets and action of Tomorrow Never Dies, this  seems like a step back for Bond.

Anyway, back to the contents of  the DVD. TWINE is not the best Bond, but Brosnan seems to grow more and  more in his role, and does a decent job at playing Bond. What the movie  lacks in story quality, it more than makes up for it with stunts and fx.  Nice to see Bond on ski's again, something we all remember from OHMSS. In  fact, this movie visits quite some exotic locations around the globe. This  is also the last time you'll see Q and M (who plays quite an essential part  in this movie) portraied by Llewelyn and Dench.
As far as extra's go,  this movie contains 2 audio commentaries (as opposed to any other movie in  the 2nd boxset), a documentary, Garbage's music video, and best of all,  alternate video options throughout the movie, showing drawn concept images,  behind the screens looks at producing the movie, and some insights in the  kitchen of special effects. This is the first Bond DVD to incorporate these  extra shots in the movie itself, if you select so in the menu. Cool,  that.

1079301,5,6305784906,"TWINE is the continuation of a welcome trend in the Bond series.  Like the two other Brosnan films before it, TWINE sees the improving fortunes of Oscar (tm) winner Dame Judi Dench take Universal Exports along for the  ride.  No longer is M a `bookend' character; here she-and the whole of  MI6-are integral to the plot.  Indeed, it's not just that Judi Dench  herself has grown her own role, it's that there has come a realization at  EON Studios that there is a need to create a tapestry of recurring  characters with whom Bond works.  Hence we see here the creation of an MI6  team, including the return of _Goldeneye_'s Tanner, who, though until  recently ignored in the movies, was an important, recurring character in  the books.
The practical result is that M's traditional role of mission  setup has been farmed out to her subordinates, and her screen time is  mostly devoted to the development of an actual relationship with Bond.  The  consequent chemistry between Judi Dench and Pierce Brosnan is electrifying  in an unusual filmic way.  It may be the first big budget male/female  pairing where sex is not at issue, the woman is in a position of power, and  the man has no fear of losing his job for speaking frankly.  It's a  delicious mix which allows the two performers license to smoulder.
It  also gives M an uncommon chance to become a part of the emotional, and not  just factual, set up of the movie.  Her reaction to the fruit of her  loyalties-indeed, to the field consequences of her orders--is at the very  heart of the movie.  Never have we seen an M show us actual regret about a  mission before, and it lends for the first time an air of credible  ambiguity to the invincibility of the Double-0 section.
Moving away from  the film's emotional core, however, there are problems.
The opening  sequence is ultimately unsatisfying.  I wasn't sure at first if my  displeasure came from the editing of the piece, or the length of it, but  subsequent viewings have convinced me it's the just the very ending which  is unsuitable.  This is maybe the only Bond opening where Bond is  essentially defeated before the titles.  And that's a good thing: director  Michael Apted was trying to push the Bond format in different directions.  Showing Bond as vulnerable works.  But to leave us with that defeat  unrebutted by Bond making a joke leaves the scene unclosed.  Thus, we go  into the titles much too abruptly, and we wonder, if only for a second,  `Was that a good teaser or not?'  Just those few more moments of closure  would've left us totally happy with what is in every other regard a  beautiful thing.
By contrast, beauty is the only thing that Denise  Richards has going for her.  Denise Richards' dismal performance is an  obvious earsore-but more than that, the need for her character to be  romantically linked to Bond is unclear.  Surely the formula calls for Bond  to end up with a girl at the end of the film, but this feels somehow like  he just ended up with *any* girl.  Given the complexity of his main  romantic relationship in the picture, Denise Richards' character becomes a  cheap, badly-acted gimmick that insults the careful characterization given  to the film's real female leads, M and Electra.
Fortunately these are but  aberrations on an otherwise excellent entry to the Bond series.  The return  of Robbie Coltrane, the Central Asian locations, the relevant (but  critically maligned) oil plot, and the interesting psychology of the  Electra-Renard-Bond-M quadrangle all conspire to give us a Bond experience  worth buying.  It can only be hoped that Brosnan will take his contractual  option for a fourth film-and that he'll bring MI6 back to life for  us.
(DVD notes: Like other Special Editions, this is a feature-rich DVD.  Don't even think about buying on VHS if you have the DVD option.  Unlike  most other Special Editions, the director's commentary is made without the  sometimes annoying presence of the Ian Fleming Society's interviewer.  This  is a straight-up running commentary and it's definitely the better for it.  Apted's a fascinating director, and it's more than interesting to hear him  talk about the choices he made.)",959817600,4,4189,4.817538896746817

1079305,2,6305784906,"As a long time James Bond fan, I have to say that writing a bad review is difficult for me to do, but I feel that I really have no other choice. The latest chapter in the Bond series has all the believability of a daytime  drama. Pierce Brosnan gives his usual great performance of the tough yet  sophisticated 007, and the choice of Sophie Marceau as his initial love  interest is a good one. The writing however leaves a great deal to be  desired. The plot line is so very thin, that even the most casual Bond fan  can figure out what is going to happen within 30 minutes of the films  opening credits, which leaves you the rest of the movie to do nothing but  enjoy the special effects. The addition of Denise Richards to the movie  seems to be almost an after thought, and could have just as easily been a  man, however 007 would not have any one to sleep with at the end of the  movie. Let's not blame the actors. Even the greatest actor in the world  cannot over come a horrible script. If you need this film to round out your  Bond collection then by all means buy it, but if you are looking for a good  film, keep looking.",959644800,3,1130,4.152073732718894

This stops me from being pressured to follow the crowd in a specific direction. This DVD started out  great and to me, got worse. The action was good, as always, but the movie  dragged to it's vulnerable end. I must admit that my favorite part of the  WHOLE DVD was the tribute to ""Q"" who will be SORELY missed!

If you looking for gritty realism then 007  isn't for you but if you willing to suspend belief for 2 hours and just go  with the flow then I would recommend you BUY this DVD. It dosen't move 007  on and it is a by the numbers James Bond movie, but isn't that what we  expect , we do miss the charm of Sean Connery or the quips of Roger Moore  but Pierce seems to be growing into the role by the film and I look forward  to the next edition.",959558400,2,768,3.7861635220125787
1079308,4,6305784906,"This is the 19th installment of what has become an institution in filmmaking.  James Bond has to be the most enduring of characters in film.  He has been in Her Majesty's Secret Service for almost 40 years now and  barely looks 45!  ""TWINE"" is true to the late Bond formula.  A flimsy  script serves as an excuse for Bond to wreak havoc and mayhem on evildoers  in the name of saving the world.  As always, it is full of gadgets, gizmos,  lots of corny puns, serial sexual conquests, pyrotechnics, and stunts  galore.  It is a genre unto itself, part comedy, part action/adventure, and  part sex fantasy.
This installment concentrated on taking the action and  stunts to a new and exciting level and in that regard succeeded  brilliantly.  This was one of the most impressively stunt intense films  I've ever seen.  There were stunts that made use of every element; air,  water, earth and fire.  Michael Apted set the bar at a new level with  innovative and complex stunt work brilliantly done.  The DVD has a bonus  feature that gives behind the scenes looks at the stunts and you get a real  appreciation for how much planning and work goes into setting each one up.  I was surprised to learn that Pierce Brosnan actually did some of his own  stunts.  Also, Apted's choice of locations was fabulous, with some of the  most majestic backdrops you will ever see in an action flick.
As  impressive as the action was, I still long for the days when James Bond  films were stories of international intrigue, with strong and mysterious  plot lines, rather than a predictable succession of death defying chase  scenes.
Pierce Brosnan gets high marks this time out in the starring  role.  He was witty, charming, cool, tough and very athletic.  Sophie  Marceau was alluring as the victim turned villain, though the part was  limited in scope.  Besides her bewitching beauty, Marceau is a terrific  dramatic actor and this part really didn't allow her much opportunity to  show the breadth of her talents (See `Firelight' if you want a better  example).
Denise Richards landed her first part playing a grownup in  this film.  Her character was included strictly for the titillation factor,  a role for which Richards was correctly cast and is amply equipped.  Fortunately, the part did not have a heavy line load and didn't require any  real acting, an area in which she has scant assets.
John Cleese is no  substitute for the late and irreplaceable Desmond Llewelyn as the  gadgetmaster Q.  After 17 appearances, he will be sorely missed.
This  film gets a 10 for the action sequences, and about a 4 for the story.  I  split the difference and gave it a 7/10 overall.  As Bond films go, this  was one of the more entertaining in recent memory.  Action fans will love  it.  For those looking for an intriguing plot line, probably not.",959472000,,2827,4.715463917525773
1079359,3,6305784906,"I thuroughly enjoyed the action sequences in this exceedingly entertaining movie, and I thought MOST of the characters (excluding Denise Richards as Christmas Jones)were extremely well cast. Sophie Marceau only showed half  of what she is capable of as an actress in this film,as she played the  emotional, psychotic Elektra King. Marceau was convincing, witty, and evil  to the core. Renard is a well developed maniacle character, yet his schemes  seem all too far-fetched, and his love for King is a touch unrealistic. In  my opinion, a character like Jaws or Oddjob would do a whole lot of good  for the more modern Bonds as they seem a bit dry and unimaginative. Where  this movie really lacks, though, is its plot, and...what can I say...Denise  Richards. The plot of TWINE would seriously take a 00 Agent to unravel, as  it started out convincingly enough, yet it became over-twisted, and down  right crazy! Finally, Denise Richards was about the worst actress I have  ever witnessed in a movie. Her lines were lame, her character was dry, and  her romance with James Bond (Brosnan) as Christmas Jones, was short,  displeasing, and dirty. Brosnan did all he could towards the end of this  film to make up for Richards's horrific acting! Of the three modern Bonds,  I would rate them: 1. Goldeneye: for outstanding acting, plot, and a  ""Flemingesque"" touch to it. Bravo! 2. The World is not Enough:  for outstanding action and locales, yet unconvincing plot and characters.  3. Tomorrow Never Dies: What can be said. I couldn't stand this film! Bond  was dry, the characters horrid, and the plot, almost as far-fetched as  TWINE!",959472000,,1634,4.915750915750916

1079361,4,6305784906,"I've read the mixed reviews...some hate it, some love, but ""The World is Not Enough"" is still all ""Bond.""  While some reviews commented that the ""Bond Girls"" were the sexiest yet, I disagree.  Denise Richards seems to be reading her lines.  And neither her nor Sophie  Marceau have the star quality of past Bond girls, such as Ursulla Andress  or Jill St. John, just to name a few.  After all, these Bond girls were  stars in their own right before joining Bond.  The bodies and faces were  incomparable, not the plain-jane lookalikes of today's Bond girls. While  some reviews claim Brosnan is developing the ruthlessness of Connery or  Lazenby, Connery was much more flippant (though not as much as Moore) than  Brosnan was in this movie.  Brosnan got too serious.  Come on...Bond isn't  supposed to be serious.  This is tongue-in-cheek adventure.  Let's not try  to make a serious show out of it...we'll all be disappointed.  However, the  lack of really good looking and good actresses for the Bond girls, and  Brosnans successful attempt at a more serious Bond aside, this was not a  disappointing film at all.  It had all the usual Bond stunts and gadgets.  It's lacking something in the screenplay that the old Connery movies had,  but then this is the 21st century.  Everything changes.  This was the usual  visually exciting Bond film.  No disappointment.  See it.",959385600,4,1373,4.868995633187773

I must have just been restless because I gave it another chance when it was released on video and, boy, I'm glad I did!  The film was  pretty good.  The speedboat chase scene is among my favorite action  sequences ever and the Bond Girls are beautiful.  The only complaint I  have, though, is a pretty big one.  Some of the inventions and plot details  are just way too unrealistic for me.  Call it futuristic if you want, but  some of the stuff is just plain stupid.  They look real (of course) with  the great special effects, but make you say, ""Yeah Right.""

1079363,5,6305784906,"""The World Is Not Enough"" will go down in the annals of Bond as  one of the best in the series, but not just for the action sequences  (though they are appropriately spectacular), and not just for the  ""Bond girls"" (though both Marceau and Richards are gorgeous, and  INTELLIGENT), and not just for Brosnan's Bond (although he's continuing the  perfect tone for Bond that he strived for in ""GoldenEye"" and set  in ""Tomorrow Never Dies""--as one Amazon.com reviewer put it,  ""Connery's vicious edge, Moore's amusing wit, and Dalton's  brutality"").  No, this movie will be a classic because it actually  tries for a meaningful plot and three-dimensional characters.
Not only do  you have the stock  ""Bond-vs-vicious-villain-out-to-destroy-a-portion-of-the-planet""  theme (done realistically for a change), but you also have some subtleties  of plot and characterization that we haven't seen the likes of since  ""From Russia With Love.""  Bond actually gets hurt in the opening  action bonanza, and for the rest of the film, his shoulder causes him  pain--making him the perfect counterpoint to the villain who can on longer  feel any physical pain at all.  Though this might seem like a ""comic  book""-ish villain trait at first, it works well here, since Renard is  racked with and ruled by an all-too-human emotional pain, while Bond steels  himself to do his job by shutting off his emotions altogether.
Seriously,  this may sound like so much ""movie critic"" babble, but watch the  movie and you'll see what I mean.
Buy it, and maybe they'll keep making  more excellent Brosnan Bond flicks like this one.",959299200,,1602,5.112403100775194
1079364,5,6305784906,"In the nineteenth James Bond film, we find 007(Pierce Brosnan) acting as bodyguard to an oil tycoon's daughter(Sophie Marceau) after her father is killed by madman, Renald(Robert Carlyle), in an act of revenge after a  botched kidnapping and extortion of Marceau. What follows is a web of  deceit, lies, and madness which will test the very limits of both James'  and MI6's, especially M's, mettle. This has all the usual trademarks of a  typical Bond flick, with impressive gadgets(check out Bonds sunglasses),  beautiful women, top action seqences, and of course all of Bond's little  one liners we've all come to expect. But this time around, a little bit is  borrowed from older Bond flicks, such as the classic M interrupting James  and Moneypenny conversation via the intercom sequence, which hasn't seen  the light of day since the days of Connery and Moore. As well as the ending  which reminded me of Moonraker and The Spy who loved me(if you've seen  those movies, then I won't go into details). The story is quite impressive.  Characters are given more life and a bit of depth, both emotionally and  mentally. Not to mention characters which were only brief in showing in  previous outings, such as M(Judi Dench), are given more screen time and add  to the story immensley. Saddly this was Desmond Llewelyn's(Q) last movie,  but John Cleese looks to be a good replacement. An excellent addition to an  already memorable series.",959299200,,1438,4.949790794979079
1079365,4,6305784906,"Movies are fantasies. OF COURSE the whole concept of James Bond is  farfetched, and the implementation is even more ridiculous. So what? James  Bond movies, for almost 40 years, have been some of the best escapist  fantasy cinema has to offer. ""The World Is Not Enough"" is in the  top half of Bond films in terms of overall quality, with some fantastically  staged action scenes (even if a couple are nicked from other Bond films).  Pierce Brosnan continues to stake out his place as the second best Bond,  after Connery. He's got style, charm, a dry sense of humor, and a sense  that this is all a bit daft, which helps immeasurably. The villain Renard  is poorly written, but Robert Carlyle does his best with the part. Sophie  Marceau is an anti-Bond Girl type who thinks a lot like Bond. Very sexy and  convincing, but with a girl-gone-bad attitude that is a great foil for  Brosnan. Denise Richards is one of the worst Bond girls ever (and yes, her  role -- a twenty-something NUCLEAR PHYSICIST working in Azerbaijan -- is  preposterous), but fortunately, Marceau gets far more screen time. TWINE is  different as well in that M (a dignified Judi Dench) gets caught up in the  intrigue and action to a far greater extent than any other Bond film. So  overall, even with the awful double-double-entendres at the end of the film  that had the entire theater groaning when I first saw it, ""The World  Is Not Enough"" is a more-than-worthy addition to the Bond canon. It at  least justifies James Bond's continued existence.",959299200,,1524,4.700757575757576

I couldn't really care less about the villian that I  think his codision is a physical impossobility. And that I think  it didn't  really have much plot. But hey... you might like it.

You know how much they hyped Bond's  modified BMW with all its gadgets, but we hardly see it do anything before  it is hacked into two pieces!  Wow, we saw it launch a missle and destory a  helicopter and also saw it start remotely.  Big deal!  I wanted to see more  emphesis on this car.  I do admit the X-Ray Vision goggles were cool and  that scene was very, very nice.  I just was not thrilled by this movie,  like I was with the others before it.

1079434,3,6305784906,"Although Pierce Brosnan is by far the best Bond since Connery, he can't  save this film from mediocrity. Not even with the aid of eye candy Bond  girl Denise Richards.
I can't really pinpoint the exact reason why I  don't really like this movie. There are great effects and some good acting,  but a number of details spoil the overall experience. First of all, the  plot just seems to be bits and pieces from all the other Bond movies mixed  quite badly together to form something not entirely uninteresting, but  definitely less than exhilarating. And that's a big crime in a Bond movie.  Secondly, Bond has gotten far too many one-liners for his own good. Brosnan  fights bravely to prevent his character from becoming a walking clich, but  even he can't save this script completely, although he really tries.  Although a Bond movie is not a real Bond movie unless good old James gets  to say some witty lines now and then, there are limits. This is not a  slapstick comedy!  Overall, the movie never really catches the real Bond  spirit.
Tomorrow Never Dies was a far better movie than this, and I hope  the next Bond movie will be that as well.",958953600,,1148,4.58128078817734

Along with the usual Bond formula of high tech gadgets, one-liners, and of course, the Bond girl(s), this latest installment also  provides a story with a different twist.  Throw in a combination of mind  games, an unusual villain, exotic locales, and amazing stunts and you get  an explosive, testosterone driven, eye-candy, action-packed thriller with a  dash of high quality performances.  One sequence in particular is the high  adrenaline boat chase along the Thames River that takes place very early in  the movie.  Cool stuff!
The story delves much deeper into the psyche of  James Bond than previous 007 flicks.  Pierce Brosnan plays a much darker  and vulnerable 007 in his third run as the British super agent spy James  Bond.  The World Is Not Enough also showcases the acting talents of Dame  Judi Dench (who plays M) and Sophie Marceau as well as many others.  John  Cleese, of Monty Python fame, also plays a role in the movie as the heir  apparent to Q.  Every character played a larger role in this movie, in  which, there were times when I felt James Bond was a supporting character  rather than a leading one.  There is definitely no shortage of star power  in this movie.
A few things I didn't like about this movie (just my  personal opinion mind you) were the opening Bond song, the paraglider-ski  sequence, and the miniature scaled models.  Yuck!  Still though, this  latest 007 thriller gives a good ride!  Humor, international intrigue, and  plenty of action.

I could go on for pages why I didn't like this film much, and the rating reflects that, but I'll just give a few comments on the DVD extras. First the  introduction is too obnoxious and there is no way to skip past it. The very  short, 15 minute, 'making of' feature was more like a 'E!' feature from TV  with some rather boring interviews with some of the cast and crew. The  'secrets' section was very interesting with storyboards combined with  unfinished scenes that showed what the shots looked like before final  production. The video by Garbage is very good too. It's a great song  although short. The music video isn't just cut scenes from the movie,  although it has them, but a whole little story in itself. Finally a big  oversight in my book is a lack of English subtitles, although French and  Spanish is included.

""tommorrow never dies"" was (arguably) the best of the series  (sorry ""goldfinger"" fans). now this...""the world is not  enough"" has so many failures to it's credit, it's hard to imagine  where to begin. the two star rating is simply one for pierce, and one for  john cleese, who now fills in for our beloved ""Q"". but that's  where it ends. robert carlyle plays a very-lightweight heavy who's as  unforgetable as this film. sophie marceau is almost as unforgetable, but  what is not unforgetable or unforgivable is the casting of denise richards.  this is no bond girl...she looks more like bond's daughter. and following  off the heels of the terrific michelle yeoh from ""tomorrow never  dies"", you would think that the casting agent would put away his  ""buffy/dawson/party of five"" casting book and get a real woman.  those ""child-like"" demographics don't fly in the world of bond,  and neither does this flick. but, as the previous film atests...there's  always tomorrow...",958780800,,1458,5.180257510729613

Maybe it's not as good as  ""Tomorrow Never Dies,"" but hell, ""The World Is Not  Enough"" has a great blend of style, action, humor and beautiful women.  It's intelligent and complex. The complexity is it's only flaw because  sometimes it has to slow down when it shouldn't to explain all the detail  in the intrigue. Still, it makes up for it's flaws. It's entertaining,  keeps you guessing and has a lot of style in the settings, suits, gadgets,  action sequences and yes, cars. It's visually rich in it's own way. The  action isn't stupid and elevates the story. Maybe it's not as good as one  expected, but it's still fun and interesting, very entertaining. I don't  get the slack Denise Richards has been getting, I think she did a great job  as did every other actor.

1079517,1,6305784906,"This was my first Bond movie I ever watched, and will probably be my last.  I have never seen a cornier bunch of characters in my life, heard such cheesy lines, and experienced such poor acting.  At any moment I expected  Dr. Evil and Mr. Biggelsworth to pop out and demand a million dollars from  someone.
The characters were one step above cartoon characters and were  as believable as Santa Claus in Miami.  They spoke their lines with almost  no conviction, and you could see in their eyes that they thought the movie  was a big joke.  Because it was just so foolish what went on in the movie,  and with the actors trying to be so serious, I think that's what made it  such a bad movie.
The action scenes were even more unbelievable.  From  the silly devices they traveled in and wore, and the impossible things they  did with them, I felt that I was wasting my time.  I understand where  Austin Powers came from now, and I really appreciate the sheer genius in  the flick.
Perhaps it's just me, because judging from the long-running  success the Bond series of movies has had over the decades somebody out  there enjoys them.

""Goldeneye"", ""Tomorrow Never Dies"") have injected new life into a genre that would have become obsolete years ago. Bond, the  supersmart, supercool secret agent is an anachronism: he belongs to a  bygone age in which Britain was a superpower. However, the recent films  have altogether energetically (albeit with mixed results) brought him up to  date. The traditionally male-centred attitude of the films is missing:  Bond's superior, M, in these films is a woman. Moneypenny the secretary is  no longer the dizzy chick eagerly infatuated with Bond. She gets to rebuff  him and put him in his place. A new low in violence is also reached in the  films. In the opening scenes of this one, he callously points a gun in a  man's chest (reminiscent of one of the signature touches of John Woo) and  in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"", he stabs a man with a knife (!) towards  the end, which is highly uncharacteristic of the old Bond who is much more  refined in his methods. The last reels of ""The World is Not  Enough"" contain the carnage and destruction one would associate with  the likes of Stallone and Schwarzenegger, but never with Bond.

Plummeting to a new  entertainment low, The World is Not Enough is pitiful shadow of the Bond  series former glorioius self. The suave all-knowing secret agent, the  tounge-in-cheek humor, scantly clad women, charismatic antagionists,  amazing gadgets, and hard-broiled suspense that dignified the Bond series  apart from the action pack in the 1960's has sadly been rehashed,  repackaged, and constantly reused to the point of cinematic oblivion.  Despite the obvious debonair charm of the ever-so-talented Pierce Bronson  in the role he was made for, this new Bond adventure is noticably absent of  the intelligence, sophistication, and film-making excellance that elevated  the orginal Bond films to such unparalled fame and prestige in the 1960's.  The film attempts to add mind-numbing and old-fashioned sentiment to an  old-fashioned cocktail creating a very dry dry dry martina of out-dated  cinema. Gone is the thrill of wondering what magnificent death trap will  Bond get himself out of this time, gone is fun of watching each  successively unbelievable stunt, gone are the insanely demented Goldfingers  or Earnest Blowfields, and gone are all the many numerous pleasures of  watching a James Bond film. Bond needs serious changes to the stiffling  formulas of the past, or he'll eventually end up missing in action.

1079605,5,6305784906,"I've read all the reviews, and I am not surprised at the diversity of opinions from long-time Bond fans about this movie.  The series has been around for so long, and James Bond has undergone so many incarnations, that  no film will meet every fan's expectations.  Some liked the slower plots of  the 1960's films; some prefer the tongue-in-cheek slapstick of Roger Moore;  others want non-stop action like ""Tomorrow Never Dies"".
TWINE  combines elements of all past Bond films (fast action, easy girls,  throwaway one-liners), as well as its own additions to the franchise (a  darker and lonelier version of Bond).  It also has the same kind of  convoluted, intricate plotline that the early movies used.  They were all  utterly preposterous, of course, but this one makes viewers think hard to  sort it all out.
For my money, this movie is the best since the early  Connery days.  Brosnan's Bond is tough, but more human and vulnerable than  any of his predecessors. The villains, while not as outrageous as some  would like, were more complex than usual.  I thought Sophie Marceau was the  best Bond girl actress in the history of the series, and her character  possessed the same balance of brains and sex appeal that made Octopussy so  popular.  Even Denise Richards was superior to the Bond girls of such  classics as ""Diamonds Are Forever"" and ""Man With the Golden  Gun"".
I think, when Brosnan finally steps down, his movies will  stand the test of time better than Roger Moore's or Timothy Dalton's.  Fans  will probably rank him second only to Sean Connery, who had the  insurmountable advantage of having been the first.",958608000,6,1630,4.850364963503649

Tommorow Never Dies grew on me  after repeated watchings, so I guess TWINE will too after a while, but I  didn't walk away from this thinking it will reign as one of the best Bond  flicks.  It's definitely worth seeing but I think if you're like me, when  the movie fades to black there is going to be a little dissapointment.

With all those gadgets, Bond movies started to seem like a visit to Sharper Image or Brookstone. Unfortunately, this movie is distracted somewhat (The previous movie, ""Tomorrow Never Dies"", is far superior and more coherent.), and the British superspy is still driving that German sportscar, and using that grappling hook/watch. Make sense? Not if you remember that Bond loved his martinis shaken and not stirred, his women in flocks and his cars British. I expected more from director Michael Apted: the plot is all over the place, the ending is abrupt, ""M"" does things that the British government would never allow a person of such power to do, and the villains are weak.  (The main villain is the actor who portrays the loveable character from ""The Full Monty"". C'mon. What next? Elmo versus Bond?) If these type of things don't annoy you, and if you enjoy action movies, then you'll probably like the latest installment of the Bond franchise.

1079727,4,6305784906,"After the relative failed attempts at ""updating"" Bond in both ""Goldeneye"" and ""Tomorrow Never Dies"", Michael Wilson and Barbara Broccoli finally get it right with ""The World is Not  Enough"".  Much of the strength of this film lies with director Michael  Apted, whose previous credits are limited almost exlusively to dramas  (""Blink"", ""Nell"", ""Gorillas in the Mist"") and  documentaries (""Incident at Odwala"").  The result of his  direction, as well as a superb script by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade  (""Plunkett & Macleane"") is a Bond film that at last allows  some complex character relationships to underline the pyrotechnic action.  From an exhilarating opening sequence (the best of perhaps any of the Bond  films), the film rolls out with a plot that seems a bit better constructed  that most of the other Bond films, some interesting character interaction  and some of the most human villains the series has ever been able to offer.  Sophie Marceau and Robert Carlyle turn in excellent performances, much  better than many of the other high profile actors to portray villains in  the series (such as the cartoonish performances given by Christopher Walken  and Jonathan Pryce, to name a couple).  Brosnan looks and acts the part  better than any Bond in years: he is undoubtedly the best man for the role  besides Sean Connery himself.  With some highly original action sequences  (I particularly liked the ""buzzsaw helicopter"" sequence) and a  story that for a change actually explores Bond's darker side, ""The  World is Not Enough"" is, in my opinion, one of the finest films in the  series.",958521600,,1597,5.05

Sound like fun?  It is!
The villain is one of the best in a while,  the plot, while still grandiose in the Bond tradition, is a little more  grounded in reality than those in recent memory, and the movie even  foregoes the Grand Exposition, where the villain reveals the Big Plan and  the motivation to Bond seconds before Bond dispatches him.  I felt this  Bond movie actually held more respect for the viewer than most movies, Bond  or not.
Overall, it's no cinematic masterpiece.  Action sequences are  what you'd expect, the girls are gorgeous, and the one-liners and double  entendres come fast and furious.

The Denise Richards character seems to almost an afterthought....However, the pacing is fast, with the spectacular stunts one expects from the Bond films,(the insurance rates for stuntmen on a Bond film must be the highest in the world)the gadgets are there, certainly the beautiful women are there, and Desmond Llewllyn's last appearance as ""Q"" should not be missed..(surely they are not going to REALLY use John Cleese as his replacement...)Not a bad movie overall, but with some small adjustments it could have been so much better....",958262400,,1252,5.223880597014926

It has vile albeit interesting villains,  sexy femme fatales and the everpresent ""good"" Bond girl, action  sequences that move at a breakneck pace (tell me the Q-Boat sequence at the  beginning didn't keep you on the edge of your seat), an enthralling and  twisting storyline, and one of the best end sequences in any of the Bond  films so far.  In a way The World Is Not Enough reminds me of the early  Sean Connery films like From Russia With Love and Thunderball, Brosnan even  appears to have taken some lessons from the Connery era in the way he  handled the character this time around.  As a huge 007 fan, this movie was  like a God send.  I hope and I believe that number 20 will be just as good  if not better.",958003200,,896,4.218934911242603

All the hype Robert Carlyle's character got as being bad and invincible amounts too nothing!  He's meant to be this big  terrorist but in the end it turns out that he's in love with a woman, which  results in a very big letdown at the end of the movie.  This is because the  bad guys in Bond movies are bad, that's it.  You can't start giving them a  heart.  There's no sense or feeling of satisfaction when Bond kills  him.
However, Brosnan is making the role his own.  John Cleese is going  to be a good replacement for Q and yes, the women are hot!  Even though  Denise Richards acting is dire but hey, that's not what she's there for is  it!
The action sequences are explosive and so are the stunts, which you'd  expect as the budget for each movie gets bigger and bigger.  There's more  one-liners in this than any other Bond movie and the one at the end of this  movie is a classic!
This is a good all-round movie, it's just not a  good Bond movie.  However, I enjoyed this movie a lot and I know you will  too!  So I advise you to buy this, sit down and relax cos Bonds gonna take  you on a roller coaster ride of entertainment!",958003200,3,1237,4.139830508474576

Robert Carlyle is so unscary he belongs in Sesame Street. Denise Richards is a nuclear scientist (!) who wears tight fitting tops and hot pants instead of the white coat.

Director Michael Apted seemed an odd choice to me and he has succeeded in making every single scene as dull and leaden and unimpressive as it is possible.

1079954,3,6305784906,"""The World is not enough"" is a decent action movie and a worthy entry in the never ending James-Bond-franchise. Since I have a weakness for Bond movies I hoped this one would be even better than the first two  Brosnan-starrers which were really not bad, but weren't among the best  films of the franchise. In some respects, ""The World is not  enough"" is better than its two predecessors, but in some others, it's  worse.
Let's start with the good news. I think that this film has more  class than the last Bond film. It is less joyless and Brosnan shows a  little bit more edge. Fortunately there is also less product placement in  this picture than in the last one in which this was pushed to an  intolerable degree. Another strength of the picture is its villain, one of  the best in the series. What disappointed me was the lack of tension and  the rather unexciting action scenes which were, for the most part, worse  than in the last films. After the incredible pre-credit-sequence, the  quality of the action goes steadily downward. The lame showdown is slightly  better than the one in ""Tommorow never dies"", still you have to  say that all Brosnan Bonds ended with the worst action scene of the entire  movie, a big mistake since you should end the film with the BEST you have  to offer.
All in all, ""The World is not enough"" is a step in  the right direction in terms of storyline and characterization. Now they  should hire a director who is a wizard in action sequences (maybe John Woo  should become a Briton). It is also the film that will always be remembered  as the one with last appearance of ""Q"". Its place in the  Bond-history-books is therefore secured.",957916800,2,1673,4.565656565656566

maybe its the fact that  its Desmond Illiewen's last performance as Q.  As R stepped in, you could  not help but to feel a valuable asset to the Bond franchise was being lost.  Q provided the comic relief with his often hilarious laboratory scenes and  playful disgustedness of Bonds style.  Not only did the Bond franchise lose  a valuable asset, but the world lost a good man when he died in that tragic  accident.
maybe its different because it has mmore action than most of  the other Bonds.  its also more sexually oriented (man, that last line  makes the whole movie) with Christmas Jones and Electra King. The male  villian is also interesting, a man who can fell no pain and can push  himself harder than anybody.

Sheryll Crow did the  ""This World is not Enough"" theme and boy was that crap! Also, a  final note about A View to a Kill- Christopher Walken and Grace Jones are  absolutely positevely the most entertaining villians of the whole Bond  franchise.
Pierce Brosnan, hmm... where do i start? He's dull, he's a bad  actor (why else would a guy star in a television show in the early 80's,  but then with his swave looks never become a big movie star until as late  as 1995- obviously because he has zero acting skills), he doesn't have any  wit (or at least the writing is horrible), he has a lame temper, and worst  of all he doesn't have a British accent!

This movie is all about perfectly  choreographed action scenes, plenty of sex, drinks (the immortal phrase,  shaken but not stirred), dry English joke.  In summary, this is a VERY  macho movie.  Under the guidance of the director, Michael Apted who's more  well-known directing dramas, Pierce Brosnan is given the opportunity to  play a more wholesome human character.  James Bond is always potrayed as  this super-spy who's able to save the world in the nick of time but never  are we shown his lonely side.  He's this man who's so good in his job that  his heart has been turned stone cold.  I couldn't agree more with other  fellow reviewers that Denise Richards is too pretty, too busty, too leggy,  too Californian to be this nuclear scientist.  But Sophie Marceau, she's  Sexy in capital letter. I wish the movie could concentrate more in  expanding the character of James Bond's nemesis in the movie, who's devoid  of any feelings.  David Caryle, who played Frank McCourt's father in  Angela's Ashes would be more than able to up to his job.

Pierce Brosnan, no matter what cranky critics say, is a fantastic Bond, who is sort of like a melting pot of the past actor's  best attributes. Connery's vicious edge, Moore's amusing wit, and Dalton's  brutality. Another thing that makes Brosnan a keeper is that, like Connery  and Moore, he has fun with Bond. Dalton and Lazenby made the mistake of  taking this as a serious acting job. It isn't. TWINE does have a great  script which is understandable (I guess a lot of people who complained just  weren't attentive, since very few modern movies require that.) Renard may  have been a lame bad guy, but Carlisle did play him well and believably -  isn't that all that counts? Denise Richards, however laughable she was as  Christmas Jones, did well with her material. And, the way I look at it, she  wasn't evne the main Bond woman this time around. Sophie Marceau is perhaps  one of the sexiest Bond women ever to grace the silver screen. There was no  doubt that she was the perfect choice for Elektra King, playing the  good-girl gone bad to a tee. I hope she is more visible in future years.",956966400,126,1194,4.628571428571429

The things that caught my eye most were the superb opening  scenes, and the non-stop action. The first chase scene is the best of any  Bond film (i'm sure others will agree). I went to see it in theatre with  some friends and we all loved it. Now i'm looking foreward to buying it as  soon as it comes out from Amazon( May 16). So, I give this movie 4 3/4  stars.

In this film Bond  is sent to protect Electra King, the daughter of a wealthy businessman from  a probably his most dangerous villian to date.

Aside from the pre-title boat chase and the snow  chase, everything else is done in obvious studio sets and interiors, with a  poor sense of timing and choreography. Whatever happened to the outdoors,  adventurous Bond? Why is he confined in tiny spaces so much? The plot, as  many claim to be better than in most other Bonds, serve only to lead up to  each action scene, which are poorly-paced, in addition to what I've already  mentioned. Any attempt to flesh out characters are appallingly lame as it  is focused only on the villains. And both of them are flaccid sleepwalkers.  Come on, we all know a good Bond villain needs to be over the top. And the  attempt to be serious and sympathetic is further undermined by puerile  slapstick and bad puns. John Cleese isn't a very worthy replacement for Q  either, judging from his performance here. Or maybe he's hampered by the  horrendous dialogue.

I'll first describe the things they did wrong  for this one: Denise Richards and underexploitation of the villain. I'm  sorry, but Denise Richards is no nuclear physicist, and shame on the  casting directors for trying to pawn her off on us. She's hot, I'll give  her that. But her lines were delivered atrociously and from the minute she  walks up in her short shorts and tight shirt, you can't take the character  seriously. Of course, this is a Bond film, so you can ignore seriousness  when it comes to Bond girls if you want without it spoiling the movie. My  second problem with TWINE was how they implemented the main villain,  Renard. Now this was a villain I was interested in; he was ruthless,  unfeeling, and yet had a strange pathos about him. And the movie makers did  not use him to his full extent. I don't want to spoil too much of the  movie, but they could have done a lot more with a man who feels no pain.  Those two quibbles aside, TWINE is easily Pierce Brosnan's best effort so  far, especially after the dismal Tomorrow Never Dies. He combined his  effortless grace and charm with a certain ruthlessness that I loved about  Timothy Dalton's Bond (yes, I am a Timothy Dalton fan, don't crucify me),  and which was one of the most defining features of Connery's Bond in  Goldfinger, widely regarded as the best Bond film.

Now, TWINE has a *PLOT* (come on everyone, say it with me: PLOT!), and there is actually *DIALOUGE* (say this one with me too: DIALOUGE!) between the actors, and Brosnan really shines in this one; he really doesn't TRY to be cool, he just IS: I remember reading something in the LA Times that quoted Brosnan saying ""In this next movie, bring me in to DO something, don't just have people shooting guns at me for 3/4 of the entire movie!"". So, all the little 'Bond fans' who just saw TND and liked it, have a lot to learn from the REAL Bond fans who have been around a little in the Bond world, read the novels, seen the movies, gone to the locations, etc...

He  plays him like Connery did in Goldfinger but in fact this is the 90's  Goldfinger it's classic bond to the tee and this one is more darker and  elaborate then the  others of the 90's.

Personally, I love it when the  creators try to depart from the norm, and TWINE is one of the best examples  of this.  To begin with, it actually has a plot!  I agree, it's not the  best plot I've ever seen, but in Bond films the plot does not have to be  airtight, and at least there is more to this one than the stupid  action-driven premise of TND.  Brosnan is seriously trying to portray 007  as a real person, rather than the suave superhero parody that Moore was  trying to be.  Carlyle is great as the new millenium's Jaws, although he is  seriously underused.  The action is not non-stop, but when it comes it is  breathtakingly done.  Come on, admit it - you never expected that second  parafoil to open up, did you?  Overall, I'd say this is the fifth best  James Bond ever, much better than TND and leagues ahead of anything Moore  or Dalton ever did.

If you are expecting a short one liner movie  with pleanty of explosions and gun-fire, you are probably going to be a  little upset, but if (like me) you want a heathy mix of all the great  things that made bond so popular in the past with action, adventure,  romance, comedy, thrills, and just general fun ! then this is the movie for  you !

The plot took the most interesting twist I have ever seen in a Bond film (it kind of reminded me of the plot twist in The Living Daylights) with the good girl becoming bad.  The opening scene with the boat chase on the Thames is spectacular, one of  the best opening chase scenes filmed in a Bond film.  The caviar factory,  although a little awkward, was a good action scene also.  Brosnan is the  best Bond since Connery (maybe even better! )
What suprised me is the  amount of computer generated graphics in this film, and how easy it was to  spot them.  There are some while driving into Baku, and the pipeline chase  was also very easy to spot that it was fake.  I also think that Denise  Richards, although very hot, could have done a better job on her acting,  but that is mostly the writers fault.

1080629,4,6305784906,"I am a true Bond fan, having read all of the books and short stories and having seen all of the films in their theatrical releases. The last three have been the best since the 60's (I REALLY tried to be endeared to the  Moore and Dalton films but, even after repeated viewings, each of the films  with these actors as Bond are simply awful), and the biggest factor is  Pierce Brosnan. First of all, Brosnan cares about the character,  understands each of the carefully contrasted elements of his appeal as a  screen icon and, with each film, pushes harder to return the films to their  former glory. God bless 'im. This film continues on the right track,  although I believe that Brosnan will have to fight the good fight in order  to dispense with such glaring casting faux pas' as Denise Richards, in a  wince-inducing portrayal. As to plot gaffes, even the best of the series  (Dr. No through On Her Majesty's Secret Service)invited you to suspend your  disbelief a bit more than you might  otherwise be inclined to.
If Brosnan  can keep the bean counters and demographics experts away from scripting and  casting, the next few films-hopefully keeping Brosnan aboard while he's  still youthful enough to carry the role-will bring back the genuine  excitement and sense of epic adventure that remain the standard in  adventure, intrigue and entertainment among action films. Oh, and by the  way-let's not forget the renewed vitality of John Barry protege David  Arnold's wonderful scores and the terrific title tracks of the last three  films. Their contributions have thus far been invaluable.",953424000,11,1596,4.884328358208955

The action is fun and hokey, just what you  look for in a Bond film. The plot is interesting and involving. The writers  did a good job of getting some of the other characters major roles (M,  Valintin, and so on). I think it was a nice touch to involve M in the film  more than usual.
The opening scene is awesome and original, and from  there we're treated to everything you would expect from a Bond film;  intrigue, wit, gambling, and sexy Bond girls.
Only two complaints:
1.  Although Denise Richards is physically attractive, her acting belongs on  late-night Cinemax movies.  I can't believe how bad she is!
2.  The  climax aboard the submarine was derivitive and unsatisfying. Bond films,  especially lately have been great untill the final ""big scene""  which usually falls flat. (Exception: Goldeneye)

The plot is simple, a mad man is shot in  the head by another 00 agent after kidnapping a friend of M's daughter.  The shot doesn't immediatly kill him but it does destroy any sensation he  might have, and of course he will die shortly thereafter.  Enter Bond, who  get's back the ransome money only to find that is has been booby traped,  the resulting explosion in M16 headquaters kills M's friend, who  immediately dispatches 007 to guard the daughter of the victim, throw in  some weapon's grade plutonium, some intrigue, and a saw that really doesn't  make any sense and you've got a fun two hours.  This is certainly not the  best of the Bond films, but it is enjoyable, I would reccomend renting this  film before making any decison's though.

However, highlights of this film include the speed boat pretitle sequence which unlike most Bond's end's without some witty remark  or twist just before the title credits. The ski chase felt inconsequential  and did not link well with the rest of the film. It felt like the chase was  just stuck in because it was a bond film. However, action sequences with  Christmas and Bond make up for this.  The Title song by Garbage is  excellent, reminiscent of classic Bond title songs such as Goldfinger and  Thunderball, and by far better than Sheryl Crow's Tomorrow Never Dies.  Composer David Arnold harked back the  minor tonalities of the original  Bond themes, however the soundtrack for TWINE seems like a complete rehash  and reversal of material presented in TND. Overall The World is not Enough  has all the qualities of a Bond movie and while not one of the best, it is  also not one of the worst. Pierce Brosnan is good as always with fine  performances alongside Sophie Marceau. Dame Judi Dench whose wonderful  performance in TND is sadly lacking in TWINE, however we do see her in a  more major role.

This plotline was petty,  predictable, and so out of realism it is pathetic. Sure, i don't think bond  should be real, he is the biggest and best, so should have the wildest, but  this was rediculous (especially the closing line). And if a script comes  along to try to show a human side to bond like attempted, they need to find  a good issue for it. Even though i am looking forward to john cleese (who  else could replace Q) this movie did Desmond Llewelyn an injustice as his  legacy. Just go out and rent thunderball, or goldeneye. And to close, COME  ON HOLLYWOOD YOU HAVE THE BEST BOND ACTOR YET, DO SOMETHING WITH HIM!",951523200,,1029,4.307291666666667
1080900,5,6305784906,"Ok, everybody knows what a Bond movie is and has been for over the last 3 decades.  They all have the same formula, same characters, same themes.  If you're expecting something new, don't go here.  Hopefully one day, the  formula will change a little more, get some famous directors at the helm,  shake things up a little.  But, until then it's the same old themes.  If  you are aware of this going in and like Bond, you will love the movie.  I  think it's the best Bond in years and years.  This time around the Bond  character is less of a joker and a more serious agent.  This is definatley  not a Moore Bond.  This Bond gets hurt, shows anger, frustration, and has a  killer instinct...like a secret agent should.  The action is great.  The  actors are good, except for Denise Richards.  She is gorgeous, just a  horrible actress.  And the opening sequence is amazing.  In conclusion, I  would have changed a lot of things personnaly, but of the recent Bond  movies I've seen, this is by far, one of the best.  I go see Bond movies  for what they are, pure fun.  I don't expect to be enlightened or moved by  them.  Just to have a good time.  And this one certainly provided.",951436800,,1179,4.369158878504673
1080901,5,6305784906,"This is an incredible movie. The stunts, the plot, Pierce Brosnan, its all wonderful.  Pierce is the ultimate bond, suave, gorgeous, and full of pithy lines! You gotta love the last one!",951350400,,186,4.8125
1080902,1,6305784906,It's a good thing that guys like George Clooney and Pierce Brosnan are so good looking because they couldn't get a job sweeping streets in Hollywood based upon their talent.  Please read David Talamantes review because it is  so accurate I had to laugh when I read it and I definitely don't want to  waste any more time on this film than I already have.,951350400,,353,4.4
1080903,3,6305784906,"This is a good film, but it still lacks a good plot, and is nowhere near any of Daltons films. Brosnan gives one of his best performances as Bond, but its all to CRASH BANG WALLOP, and not enough feeling. Whatever happened  to ACTING?  Denise Richards is sweet, everyones dream Christmas, but a  nuclear scientist?  I'm not convinced. Ends on a joke that would even make  Roger Moore cringe!",951350400,,391,4.608695652173913
1080904,4,6305784906,"This movie is back to basics like the way Ian Fleming wrote the orginal books such as From Russia With Love and Dr. No. No need for fancy stunts as the movie series has done the past years but this movie shows the real  Double 'O"" British agent as a cold ruthless agent who will stop at  nothing for his government. The acting is top notch and the scenes are on  par with any of your favorite Bond movies in the past. Mr. Bronson is quite  cool and shows how he has matured in the role to be on par or even better  than Sean  as  all are compared to him!  Don't miss this one as you won't  be sorry as you will play this DVD over and over again.  May this long  running series continue and Mr. Bronson role ages like fine wine. He gets  better in each movie and is quite at home now. This movie does not need  stunts to keep your interest just the great acting. Don't just sit there!  Order this one ASAP as you won't be sorry!  Take my word as the opening  goes  BOND, JAMES BOND!",951177600,4,981,4.0
1080905,2,6305784906,"The SCRIPT Is Not Enough!  Every Bond movie must have a casino -- so right in the middle of the plot (bing!) it cuts right to James Bond being in a casino for no reason at all.  It adds nothing to the movie, but he has  to make an appearance there.  And a hot new car, outfitted with all the  gadgets (we're supposed to say ooooh, aaaaaah, niiiice car!) and they  destroy it within five minutes of him driving it, before you get a chance  to see what it can really do.  Nothing new or exciting, just the same old  formula randomly patched together.  Come off it, let's get something new  into the formula, instead of desperately rehashing the best two-minute  snippets of every Bond movie that's come before, and hoping it all adds up  to a watchable movie!  It left me feeling like a cow pushed through the  Hollywood stockades.  This is the end of this review, so now is the time  you are supposed to laugh and smile, and go away feeling good.

7894342,3,6305784906,"My least favorite of the Pierce Brosnan series. It's a good story, with good actors, but something was just off about the whole thing. It felt rushed. The quick wit and dry humor of normal Bond films was there but felt contrived. Even the action scene looked a little on the low budget side. If you're a fan of the franchise though, you'll still want to add it to your collection.",1520899200,,380,4.366197183098592

7894347,4,6305784906,This movie arrive on time and was in great condition. And it was wrap in plastic so you know that it hasn't been open. When I open the DVD case the code to digital code was not inside. Which sucks I bought another James Bond Film and it came with the codes. But I give it 4 stars but I really loved this movie. I was also a little disappointed that Denise Richards didn't put a little bit more effort on her role in the movie. Sophie Marceau did outstanding job on her role in the movie.,1514937600,4,487,4.030927835051546
7894348,2,6305784906,"I respect that they lost the comedy and went a bit more serious with this film but that's probably the only good thing that they've done. The acting is terrible, The main villain isn't that much of a villain and the dialogue is just laughably bad. Maybe under a different writer, This could have been something good.",1513209600,,316,4.56140350877193

I do watch them with him though.  This one was ok.  Had some humor and lots of action.  If you like James Bond movies, we would definitely recommend this one.",1512691200,,330,4.416666666666667
