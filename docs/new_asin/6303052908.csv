560457,5,6303052908,"Probably the most entertaining movie of its type ever made, it chronicles what happens when ray and family head off for their favorite fishing spot in the mountains,then they see a bright flash from L.A what happens next is everything you would expect to happen( price gouging beyond belief) settling payment with fistfights as people panic. Under ray millands tight direction this movie will keep you on the edge of your seat. the best SHTF/ survival movie ever 1962. the cast are all totally believeable  in their parts, This review is for the mgm midnight movies version with the last man on earth with Vincent Price on the flip side.",1507593600,,637,4.790909090909091

560459,5,6303052908,"I watched this movie on television when I was about ten years old and it scared the life out of me. I never forgot the movie but could not recall the name of it. I searched the Internet for information and finally found out what it was called. I immediately purchased it and watched it again after many years had past since I first watched it. It is still scary because although the film is quite dated, it still quite realistically shows how quickly the veneer of civilization erodes away when a terrible event such as a nuclear attack happens. It's a cautionary tale.",1505520000,,569,4.480769230769231

560487,4,6303052908,"Where I grew up (or at least got bigger) the Cold War was my multi billion dollar alarm clock.
Every dawn I woke to see the sky move as a B52 Stratofortress returned from maneuvers to land at the SAC. It was a different time from just a few years later: Vietnam/Night of the Living Dead, the 68 Convention/Easy Rider, Apollo 13/2001 A Space Odyssey; before the Charlton Heston somehow glamorized mankind's well deserved resetting (Soylent Green, Omega Man , Planet of the Apes) it was a time of wonder and despair.

This movie puts me in mind of the kind of movie I went to see at a drive in when I was youth.  Movies like this would part of a double feature.  In my mind it is an above average ""B"" movie.  The special effects are strictly average.  Firearm safety is nonexistent.

The movie, of course, is fiction.  However, there are some strange coincidences that occur that makes the movie even more unbelievable.  What made the movie most enjoyable to me is the time piece aspect of the movie.  The vehicles, of course, are from the 1950s and the early 1960s.  The towns outside Los Angeles are amazingly rustic.

560491,4,6303052908,"This is an excellent movie that can make you think or have discussions with others.  The general plot has been outlined by other reviewers, so I won't repeat it here.  The main reason I am writing the review of ""Panic in Year Zero"" is that the Blu-ray Kino-Lorber disk I received, did NOT have subtitles/closed-captions, in any language, as indicated in the description.  Subtitles are important for my parents who do not hear well, and I specifically bought this version because the description stated english subtitles were available.  This is the main reason I took 1 star off.  On the plus side, the picture is beautiful transferred and, unusually for a older low-budget film, the sound was clear enough for my parents to understand most of it without subtitles.",1490918400,,766,4.906976744186046

560530,4,6303052908,"Almost nave I guess. Quite amusing to compare this with later post apocalyptic films which were unmitigatingly bleak. A family struggles to retreat and stay safe from the rest of humanity after an unexpected nuclear attack, while retaining their moral conscience. As the rush of survivors from the big city starts to kick in, local merchants start to gouge. But our hero also has to start acting in his family's best interests, rather than adhering to social norms. But eventually, the real baddies in the piece are a gang of punk kids, who looked like bad-uns anyway.
I always think that films like this were made almost like public information films, or maybe some kind of predictive programming to prepare the population for the horrors to come.",1480982400,2,748,4.897637795275591
560531,3,6303052908,"Made in the early 1960's, Panic in the Year Zero was a product of the Cold War hysteria that once gripped the nation. The movie, which starred and was directed by Milland, raises some thought provoking questions on how society might collapse in the face of a nuclear attack. The acting is adequate, but the movie had a very low budget and the black-and-white production looks like it was completed in about a week. It's an interesting glimpse of the mindset that dominated the country back then. It was made and released around the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis, so it remains an informative glimpse of the times back then. It also has some unintentional laughs as Milland argues with a gas station owner who has increased the price of the gasoline above the listed 35 cents a gallon. It belongs in a time capsule.",1479427200,4,817,4.602739726027397

560643,4,6303052908,"From 1962, what I would call the granddaddy of all ""nuclear war"" movies. I will grant you that it is low on effects and low on what we may consider reality but overall I think it gets it right, from the human standpoint anyway. This will show humans at their lowest and I also believe this is the type of turmoil that would follow and disaster, the human being will do anything to survive. the central figures are a family that is travelling to the hills in California for a vacation and then the bombs drop behind them. the problems and difficulties this family meets and overcomes are wonderful. Let me say that the supporting cast is superb. The family led by Ray Milland(also directed), Jean Hagen, Mary Mitchell (daughter) and the absolute best performance of the movie by Frankie Avalon (son, pre-beach movies). I have always had the same problem with Ray Milland and as he got older it became more prevalent.....he growls through the whole thing.",1467417600,,953,4.678571428571429

560727,5,6303052908,"I bought this move based on the reviews even though I'd never seen or even heard of it before. Prior to this my experience with nuclear holocaust had mostly been the ones from the eighties (The Day After, etc.) that largely consist of impressive special effects and people sitting around feeling sorry for themselves who try too hard to convince us how terrible life is after a nuclear war. Panic In Year Zero, on the other hand, is completely different, and in a good way. If you're looking for epic scenes of devastation, you won't find them here. This story isn't about what Los Angeles looks like afterward nuclear annihilation but about what happens to one family lucky enough not to be there when it happened.

From a technical perspective, the acting is consistently excellent. It somehow escaped my attention before watching that the son was played by Frankie Avalon, and he did a great job as did the other cast members. Not surprisingly, the best performance is that of Ray Milland himself, and he also did an outstanding job of directing. I especially liked the diner scene early in the movie where people were acting fairly normal and yet the tension was thick enough that you could cut it with a knife. I also liked the lectures Harry Baldwin occasionally dished out, especially the one directed as his wife after her misguided effort to prevent their son from shooting one of a trio of hoodlums. In fact, that little speech needs to be given to all the many stupid characters in every other apocalyptic movie, where they seem not to grasp a very simple but also very important concept: that sometimes it's necessary to kill in self-defense, especially when society has collapsed and you run into people willing to kill you for what you have.

In fact, probably my single favorite thing about this movie was how effective the main character (patriarch Harry Baldwin) was at dealing with the situation. After initially heading back to Los Angeles, Baldwin's character takes charge and begins making smart decisions. In any other script, the writers would create tension by having the lead make dumb decisions and then narrowly escape the consequences, but not here. That isn't to say that it turns out to be smooth sailing for the Baldwin family, but if something like this did ever happen, Harry Baldwin is the kind of guy you'd want to stay close to. And again, that's what makes it fun: because we DO get to go with him in a way. Instead of muttering, ""Don't do that, stupid!"" to my television as I would with most movies of this genre, I kept finding myself nodding and thinking, ""That's smart, Harry."" When World War III is going on the rules are a little different: you leave the cannoli and take the gun. Or, if you're smart like Harry Baldwin, you take both.",1462147200,11,2778,4.702258726899384

560829,4,6303052908,"This review is for the blu-ray version of 'Panic in Year Zero' by Kino Lorber released in April, 2016.

I'd prefer to give it 4 1/2 stars. 5 stars for the transfer 4 stars for the movie. While not a great movie it is a very good one. Also you only get one movie (MGM's Midnite Movie release paired this with another movie.) You do get a few extras though to help out.
You get an informative analysis by Joe Dante. You also get a commentary track that is very informative along with a trailer for this and a few other recent releases of older science fiction movies by Kino Lorber.
While not always the best of value, especially for old low budget movies, I am very appreciative to at least have the option of getting a good old sci-fi movie on blu-ray. For that Kino-Lorber deserves to be applauded.

The transfer is a real beauty. It was great to see such a nice clean print on a classic low budget sci-fi movie. If you are a fan of these types of movies and want the best possible picture then this one is a must for your collection.

The movie itself seems to be based on two old stories called Lot and Lot's Daughter (At least that's what I learned from the extra's. I myself had never heard of these stories until I listened to the commentary track and Joe Dante's comments.

The plot is very simple. Harry Baldwin (Ray Milland) and his family, wife Ann (Jean Hagen), son Rick(Frankie Avalon) and daughter Karen (Mary Mitchell) leave the Los Angeles area with their station wagon and trailer to go on vacation. On the way they see flashes of light coming from the coastal areas. They soon learn that a nuclear attack against the United States has taken place and that Los Angeles has been hit. From this point onward, Harry, decides that he needs to get supplies immediately and go into hiding until civilization is back in order. He decides from the get go that he will do anything to protect his family. This includes shooting people if necessary. He takes his family a park for hunting and camping. As expected civilization is breaking down and they are forced to defend themselves and find supplies in order to survive.

'Panic in Year Zero was made on a low budget and was directed by Ray Milland himself. He did a very good job. The budget didn't allow for a whole lot but he did a good job with what he had. The movie is entertaining and moves along. It is a very serious movie and there is little to no comedy in it.
The acting is very good as might be expected from the cast. Ray Milland was once an 'A' lister. Jean Hagen was well known from 'Singing in the Rain' and many other movies and televsion shows. Frankie Avalon obviously became well known shortly thereafter due to his Beach movies with Annette Funicello. Even some of the supporting actors were well established actors.

I try not to nitpick too much at these old science fiction movies but the scenes in the car were obvious mistakes. There was a trailer behind the car that blocked all vision, yet you can see everything through the rear window. At the time of this writing i'm not sure if that was a mistake or deliberate. I didn't listen to the whole commentary track yet...just a few parts.

SPOILER THIS PARAGRAPH - One thing I found surprising was that Ray Milland actually shot and killed people and committed a few crimes along the way by assaulting a store owner and effectively stealing items despite the fact that he said he would pay down the road. In no way was he 'punished' by movie's end. While he may have been protecting his family, he shot and killed two unarmed young men while holding them at gunpoint. One of them made no attempt to attack him. They may have been dangerous by this act was vigilantism. I'm surprised these acts got by the censors as I believe the censorship code was still in force at the time of this movie.

Recommended for any fan of post-apocalyptic fiction and fans of old science fiction movies.",1461110400,3,3918,4.447075208913649
560830,5,6303052908,"Panic in the Year Zero,"" made in 1962 at the height of the Cold War, is a sobering look at the aftermath of a nuclear attack, as seen through the eyes of the Baldwin family  Harry (Ray Milland), wife Ann (Jean Hagen) and their two teenage children (Frankie Avalon, Mary Mitchel). While they are off on vacation, their hometown of Los Angeles and four other major American cities undergo a nuclear attack. The family heads to a fishing cabin in the mountains where they hope to steer clear of residual radiation and armed survivalists, get information about the extent of the devastation, and figure out their next moves.

Science-fiction movies of this era dwelt a lot on alien invasion and usually depicted a world bound together in a concerted attempt to defeat the attack from beyond the stars. Panic in the Year Zero dealt with a then-present  fear that nuclear war would mark the end of mankind as we know it. The film capitalizes on that paranoia in a doomsday scenario that seemed frighteningly plausible. With a breakdown of law and order, desperate people  once decent citizens  are driven to acts of violence. Looting is rampant, and survival of the initial blasts doesnt guarantee surviving the lawless aftermath. The movie is pessimistic in its portrait of humanity spiraling out of control.

Other films have dealt with nuclear attack, notably Fail Safe, Dr. Strangelove, On the Beach, The Day After, and most devastatingly, Testament. This one was Ray Millands first time directing a theatrical feature after having directed several TV shows. Frankie Avalon was a pop singing sensation at the time, appeared in many movies in the early 1960s, and is best remembered for a series of fun-at-the-beach musicals with co-star Annette Funicello.

Bonus extras on the newly restored HD Blu-ray release include Atomic Shock!, a short film in which director Joe Dante discusses Panic in the Year Zero; audio commentary by film historians; and trailer gallery.",1460851200,,1964,5.006134969325154

560834,5,6303052908,"THE STORY: Ray Milland (who also directed) portrays Harry Baldwin, a WWII vet taking his wife and teenage son & daughter high into the California Sierra mountains for a well-deserved vacation of camping & fishing. A few hours into their trip they witness blinding flashes far behind them - just about where L.A. is. Some sort of storm... or heat lightning perhaps? Immediately afterwards it becomes impossible to get any radio reception - you can see the wheels turning behind Harry's eyes. Later, when they do manage to pick up a radio station, it comes in the form of an Emergency Broadcast Network bulletin. His worst fears are confirmed: civilization just got cancelled. Harry's nervous wife Ann wants to go back to get her mother and he begrudgingly, (and more than a little foolishly), agrees. On the winding mountain back roads the family encounters steadily increasing traffic, as panicked citizens of L.A. flee the doomed city like rats from a sinking ship. Harry stops at a roadside diner so they can grab a bite and try to speak with someone for more information on what's happened. One of the patrons who fled the destruction shares what little he knows, and it isn't good. The mounting fear & hostility in the crowded diner are palpable - and spreading dangerously fast. Later, while refueling at a gas station, the Baldwins witness a shocking act of eye-opening violence, and Harry sadly realizes that there is no going back. From that point on we see him shed his middle-class businessman persona, becoming a grimly determined survivalist who will do whatever it takes to safeguard his family. His street smarts and prior military training & experience are put to the ultimate test as he is forced to make hard choices, and make them quickly in order to obtain the food & supplies his family will need once they reach their remote camping destination. To get there Harry & his family will have to traverse miles of open roads teeming with careless drunks, ruthless punks, hysterical paranoiacs and murderous maniacs. If they make it, Harry can only pray that they will be able to hold out for as long as it takes for our military to restore some semblance of law & order.

THOUGHTS: One of my all-time favorite movies. Yes, PANIC IN YEAR ZERO! is somewhat cliched and either ignores or downplays the more horrid aftereffects of nuclear war, radioactive fallout & atomic disease, but it's the core concept of the movie that grabs you. It treats its subject matter deadly serious. There are no fantastical mutant monsters shuffling about nor desert wastelands crawling with radiation-enlarged insects & lizards, etc. PANIC attempts to show you what things might really be like - at least as much as its limited budget would allow. That this movie is as good as it is is really a small miracle when you consider that it was produced by American International Pictures, a studio whose primary output was drive-inn/exploitation/schlock fare such as I WAS A TEENAGE FRANKENSTEIN, ATTACK OF THE GIANT LEECHES and GHOST OF DRAGSTRIP HOLLOW. The intelligent script, (courtesy of Jay Simms & John Morton, from a story by Simms), is actually trying to say something underneath all the chaos & hysteria, and while it may not be very optimistic it certainly feels realistic. The practical, methodical rationalization of Ray Milland's Harry Baldwin impresses me to no end. Once it becomes clear that it's all hit the fan, Harry's courtesy & manners are put on indefinite hold. Seeing this amiable father & loving husband coldly engage in what just 24 hours earlier would have been unconscionable (and often illegal) acts gives us serious pause for thought. It's what I love about end-of-the-world movies; you are constantly putting yourself in the protagonist's place, asking ""What would *I* do in this situation? How far would *I* be willing to go?"" In almost every case, YEAR ZERO's tense narrative has Harry behaving very realistically; doing what many of us probably would actually do if everything suddenly went south and we hoped to survive. I only have a few minor gripes with this movie. First, the film isn't given sufficient runtime to properly flesh out its characters. YEAR ZERO! would've benefited immensely from an additional 15-20mins for better character development and to feel a little less rushed. As it is, the the resultant ending is too abrupt & optimistically upbeat (though cautiously so). But the biggest strike against PANIC is its unconventional jazzy film score, courtesy of AIP go-to composer, Les Baxter. While it bravely dares to be different from the typical sci-fi stuff, I find it distracting, irritating and often wildly inappropriate. Others may like it, and that's fine, but I would have preferred something more conventional. Even so, those few negatives hardly outweigh all the stellar positives of this 1962 low budget gem. And when you take into account the fact that this was released in theaters just 3 months prior to the Cuban Missile Crisis, its thematic impact hits home even harder.

THE BLU-RAY: Kino Lorber's newly remastered Blu-ray, I'm happy to report, is a very good one. The video portion is solid, with only minimal crush (video noise). Little or no pixelation or artifacting were detected. Picture is quite sharp for the most part. Audiomix is uneven though; dialogue is level but the blaring soundtrack is a tad loud but overall not too bad. No pops, crackles or hissing were noted. A decent selection of bonus features make this worth a double dip/upgrade for those who already own PANIC on DVD. First up is an engaging (if somewhat dry) audio commentary track from film buff Richard Harland Smith which runs the film's entire length. He shares a wealth of behind-the-scenes information and trivia tidbits, making it well worth a listen for fans of the film and post-apoc flicks in general. Next is a brief retrospective segment with genre director Joe Dante that's fun. Finally, trailers for three Ray Milland-starring flicks (including this one) round out the goodies.

BOTTOM LINE: I've long been a fan of ""last man on earth"" films. Only a handful are truly great, while most are either just okay or real clunkers. PANIC IN YEAR ZERO! is definitely one of the best of the bunch. It's honest, thought-provoking, unflinchingly and surprisingly brutal at times, fairly believable (taking into account when it was made), totally engaging entertainment. So put on your Civil Defense helmet, grab your rifle, climb into your fallout shelter, turn on your Geiger counter, grab an MRE and settle in and enjoy this terrific little 93-minute slice of engaging 1960's cold war survivalist paranoia. 5 STARS.",1455667200,3,6659,4.981132075471698
560835,5,6303052908,"I continue to think back upon this movie with amazement. It is a hidden jewel; the actions of the characters are so antithetical of what you would expect from characters in an early '60's movie. A decent, middle-class father descends into theft, aggression and, ultimately, homicide to protect his family. The actions of those around them are somewhat predictable - chaotic, opportunistic - but Milland's response is original and somehow frighteningly authentic and unexpected.

The disaster could have been rewritten to be a meteor or really anything causing a temporary breakdown of order and the basic elements of the excellent story would still shine through.

Ray Milland does an excellent turn as a father on a camping trip with his family that turns into a survival odyssey. Frankie Avalon is good as his eldest son as is the rest of the cast but really when it all plays out the center of the story is Milland and how the loss of order and safety affects him.

561064,4,6303052908,"When the Baldwins shove into their station wagon (with the attached trailer) and embark on their fishing trip, they unwittingly escape the nuclear strike on Los Angeles by moments. Panic in Year Zero! - awesome title! - is a modest 1962 post-apocalyptic film, but not so modest that it couldn't put up that sobering image of a mushroom cloud billowing over L.A. Ray Milland - who stars and directs - plays stony patriarch, Harry Baldwin, a firm man of action who doesn't waste time in running for the hills with the fam. Except their try for sanctuary leaves them exposed to armed vigilantes, desperate looters, and marauding motorcycle punks.

Panic in Year Zero! feeds into the Cold War paranoia that so held the era hostage. That generation - and the one after that - lived in constant fear of the atom bomb. Give Milland his propers for not pampering the audience. It's bleak, minimalist speculative fiction, never mind that Les Baxter's groovy, jazzy score would've fit better in a 1960s TV Batman fight scene. This film lends credence to those who posit that when the fit truly hits the shan, people will let you down rather than rally.

Milland's character is hard to like, given that he comes off as a driven martinet. But he's only doing his best to safeguard his family, and he holds no illusions as to the largesse of his fellow dudes. The commands he barks out are frequently harsh but always practical and always oriented towards the family's survival. I got joy out of how Harry Baldwin reacts to that gas station attendant's jacking up the price of gas from 30 cents a gallon to $3 a gallon.

If anything, I have beef with his wife (Jean Hagen) who whines and second-guesses a lot of Baldwin's decision-making. To me, she was so slow in coming to grips with the grim new reality brought about by the collapse of society. She would've been the first to fall in a zombie apocalypse or in the Game of Thrones. Milland doesn't play down his character's flaws and contradictions. With each hard choice, his principles are tested and, yep, compromised. There's no easy out when under a mushroom cloud.

Frankie Avalon plays Milland's teenage son, and it speaks to the gravity of the situation that not once does he bust out in a beach song or surf. I do think Avalon and Milland's interplay is engrossing. Avalon wants to emulate his father. Give Milland's character enough credit that he does try to teach his kid the subtleties of firing a weapon as a last resort versus just straight-up killing a man even though he'd wronged you. But I wish he'd followed thru in one cirscumstance. The dad's humanity later ends up costing them.

The first half hour is particularly engrossing as the Baldwins must negotiate a wasteland of wrecked vehicles, and rub elbows with frantic citizens stocking up on stuff, and listening jaw-gaped to the radio announcer's ominous news bulletins. Other than that early on mushroom cloud, I don't remember any other visual effects. And yet Milland the director capably invokes a vibe of brittle tension and frayed nerves. A tough, morose, thought-provoking film that latches onto an ordinary family and presents a ground-level look at one potential aftermath should the atom-scare actualizes. I'd almost rather that Frankie Avalon sings.",1405382400,3,3275,4.83065953654189

The plot is weak. A family heads out on vacation, global nuclear war destroys major cities worldwide, they become survivalists with morals and rescue a damsel in distress. A few weeks later, order is restored and they head back to civilization. Predictable with a large dose of unrealty.

The characters are wooden and unchanging. The women are damsels in distress, the men either downhome American heroes or villains of the worst sort.

And although this happens on most 1950's and 1960's B-movies, I really hate it when voices echo off the walls on an ""outdoor"" set. There are no production values to speak of. Clothing, makeup and hair styles hold up particularly well on heroes and villains alike in this post-nuclear holocaust world.

561067,5,6303052908,"There are plenty of reviews about the movie itself.  My review is about the video quality and that of various alternatives.

TV VERSION:  This is the version played by most TV stations and networks (i.e. THIS-TV), and found in various places on the internet.  It's pan-and-scan, 4:3 definition, and of course it crops much of the widescreen picture. The camera focuses on the star (Ray Milland), making sure that he's in every shot.  As a result, the other characters often are off-screen (notably Mary Mitchel).  While all of the movie's chronology is in most versions, much detail is lost due to the pan-and-scan, and the video looks very washed-out.  If you just want to see the gist of the movie, this is probably good enough for you.

AMAZON STREAMING VIDEO: The Amazon streamed version is widescreen, close to the same as the DVD. It crops a little bit off of the DVD, perhaps 2-3% from each end.  However, the picture does look a bit on the dull side (although not as much as the TV version), compared to the DVD.

There are also pirated versions of the DVD which range from mediocre to horrible. Avoid them; only buy from trusted sites.

MGM DVD VERSION: The DVD version sold on Amazon and its partners is by ""MGM Presents MidnightMovies"", and it also includes ""The Last Man On Earth"" (starring Vincent Price).  This is the full widescreen version that appeared in theaters. The picture is sharp and clean, almost the same as it would have been in the theatrical release. If you're a purist and want the best possible copy of this movie, this is what you should get.

561305,5,6303052908,"It might not seem so today, but Panic In The Year Zero (1962) was an absolutely kickass movie for its time, taking a provocative situation, and dealing with it in a thoughtful, straightforward, and at times coldly brutal way.  In an impressive feat, Ray Milland both starred in, and directed this look at the aftermath of a nuclear attack on America, where law and order break down, and a man does whatever he can to keep his family alive.  Spoilers follow.

Harry Baldwin (Milland) and his family are on vacation, bound for Shibes Meadows, a remote spot in the country.  Baldwin is headed out of Los Angeles, towing a small trailer behind his Monterey sedan.  With him are his wife Ann (Jean Hagen), son Rick (Frankie Avalon), and daughter Karen (Mary Mitchell).  Looking back towards LA, the family see flashes in the sky, and later huge clouds rising from the ground.  Most of the radio stations are down, but preliminary reports indicate that nuclear weapons have been detonated.

Baldwin decides to return home, but soon changes his mind, as they encounter a steady stream of cars fleeing the city.  The cunning and decisive Baldwin quickly adapts to the situation, wisely procuring food, supplies, weapons, and gasoline, taking them by force when necessary.  As the news spreads about the attack, the survival instinct quickly kicks in, panic grows, the respect for law begins to slowly breakdown, and violence emerges.  The film shows this progression developing in a completely plausible and natural way.  Baldwin, a peaceful family man, goes almost immediately into survival mode, able to recognize what is critical for short term survival.

At first Baldwin's family, Ann in particular, have difficulty with Harry's manic, and at times brutally violent behavior.  Rick however quickly adapts to the situation, and is also prepared to do whatever is necessary, shooting one of a group of three punks who threaten the family.  A sign of how much Harry's morality has been altered occurs when he starts a fire, in order to cross a busy roadway.  Several cars catch on fire, but there is no regard for anyone who might be burned or killed, as the Baldwin's make their way to Shibes Meadows, and hold up in a cave.

 Safe for the moment, there is time to reflect on their situation, as Harry speaks of retaining ties to civilization, and maintaining links with reality, as a means to feeling less afraid.  The family settles in, and adapts a survivalist mentality, but matters reach a critical point, when they find some murdered people, and Karen is attacked by the same punks they ran into before.  Harry administers justice without mercy, breaking into a farm house where the men are holed up, and executing them in cold blood with a shotgun.  They also discover Marilyn Hayes (Joan Freeman), a young woman who has been sexually abused, and whose parents, the owners of the farm, were killed by the scumbags.

In an outstanding performance, Ray Milland displays sensitivity, in addition to an amazingly hard and cynical edge.  A complicated man, Harry Baldwin's all consuming will to survive and sense of paranoia, drives the entire film, which ends somewhat optimistically with the phrase ""There must be no end - Only a new beginning"".

This film firmly taps into the Cold War fears of the time, and was released just a few months before the Cuban missile crisis occurred in August in 1962, and made the threat of a nuclear attack an all too real possibility.  Given the movie ratings board, it's remarkable to even see a character like Harry in a film.  Although through the years it may not have garnered the appreciation it probably deserves, Panic in the Year Zero, is an early classic in the post apocalyptic genre, and benefits greatly from Les Baxter's bold, jazzy, and occasionally strangely inappropriate soundtrack.",1335052800,,3834,4.9145962732919255

561307,5,6303052908,"OK, I first saw this a long time ago at a drive-in from the back seat of my parents car with my brother, he fell asleep. My view is that its too close to reality for most of the people out there. Just the idea of limited nuclear war is pretty much totally unthinkable for most people. Getting down to the family level is way to personal for just about everybody, and that's the reason this film gets dumped on so much. If anything like this happened most people living in cities aren't going to make it. Since most live in cities that's most of you. So, you're all ""no way"". OK think of this. If someone had said in 1962, when this movie was made, that in the future a bunch of nuts armed with box cutters would take over American airliners then crash them into some of tallest buildings in the biggest city in the U.S. that story idea wouldn't of even been considered usable for a story-plot element in a sci-fi movie! Milland has this story about right. The shooting will happen alot quicker when people find out that the person who shoots first is the one who gets to tell the story cause it don't matter if you were right or wrong then. See, its when everyone knows that it can't happen that's when it does. Five stars.",1255392000,,1223,4.275862068965517
561308,4,6303052908,"This is probably the best movie ever made about World War Three.  Made in 1962 at the height of the Cold War, Panic in Year Zero is the story of a family which luckily leaves Los Angeles the morning before the city, and the nation, are attacked by hydrogen bombs.  The film is their story of survival.  Society breaks down, ammunition becomes the only currency, and survival is the order of the day.

This film, as other reviewers note, has nothing in the way of special effects.  Nevertheless, this is an engrossing film with pretty good acting, and the viewer truly gets a feeling of what a nuclear war might have been like for the survivors.  The ""official war bulletins"" that punctuate the movie sound real, and really add to the sense that a nuclear holocaust has taken place. I have seen several films about nuclear war, but this one remains my favorite even after all of these years.",1127520000,27,890,4.566037735849057
561309,4,6303052908,"Science fiction thrillers of the Cold War era tended to be grim reminders that man's stay on earth was at best a tenuous affair.  PANIC IN YEAR ZERO asserts that when the chips are down in a nuclear holocaust even so-called 'good' folks are more likely to loot and steal than they would like to think.  Ray Milland, who both stars and directs, hits just the right note of grim realism in front of and behind the camera.  Milland is Harry Baldwin, a solid, middle class type who takes his wife (Jean Hagen), his son (Frankie Avalon) and daughter (Mary Mitchell) on a cartrip from their home in Los Angeles to the countryside when the Big Bomb falls.  LA is devastated, though we see it only obliquely as a huge mushroom cloud and hear about it through their car radio. PIYZ is not a big budget film, and its special effects are non-existent.  Yet, not for one moment does the viewer doubt the reality of the atomic war.  Milland, with his weary face and stark grasp of reality, carries the film as he is in nearly every scene.  He knows that the strands that hold society together are fragile, and the Bomb has severed them, possibly forever.  As director, Milland sets up the viewer to accept the bruising of human decency as he places himself as an actor in several minor yet revealing scenes that point out, more to the audience than to him, that law and order ultimately  reside in the barrel of a gun.  The race for survival falls to those who can make the necessary mental adjustment.  Part of the queasy feeling that PIYZ is so rich with is that humanity is held together only by the most fragile of mutual consents.  The opportunity for some savage wilding is apparently too irresistable for many.  The radio intones incessantly about looters, and Milland has to confront a trio of punks that in ordinary times would probably have limited their hell raising to stealing a few hub caps.  Even his own son (Frankie Avalon) has to recognize that killing is a two-edged sword and that to take pleasure in it is to lower himself to the same level as the riffraff.  For Americans who had just recently witnessed the hovering of fingers on the buttons of nuclear armaggedon during the Cuban missile crisis, PIYZ was surely a wakeup call to bless those fingers that did not plunge those red buttoms into their deadly bases.",1074902400,15,2322,4.56144578313253
561310,5,6303052908,"There are older movies and better known movies in the genre but this one is the best ever made and probably the most realistic for the time period. There was no difficulty in my believeing any of the plot developments. Knowing the area well and projecting back in time I can see they even got the geography correct.
First saw this movie as a young child and it really left an impression. Ranks right up there with giant ants and triffids as apocolyptic scifi. I can only imagine what it's impact was when it was released, having been filmed right after the Cuban Missile crisis.
I really identifed with Ray Milland's character AND his entire family. Plus this is the movie where Frankie Avalon got his start. What more could you ask for?",1054857600,16,737,4.548872180451128

7837550,4,6303052908,"Ray Milland never disappoints.  He turns in a solid and stoic performance here.  There are glaring continuity errors throughout, but the acting and subject matter are pretty good.  Frankie Avalon, cashing in on his teen idol status in 1962, plays Milland's son and actually does a decent job.  Milland's career was in decline, but this shoestring thriller wasn't the bottom for him.  That came later.  This movie is worth a look.",1524960000,,429,4.971830985915493
