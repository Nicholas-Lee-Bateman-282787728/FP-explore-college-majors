7125573,5,B00W7AGUBY,Love everything Mr Tyson does.  I don't agree with everything he says but its very thought provoking!,1456790400,,101,4.9411764705882355
7125574,5,B00W7AGUBY,"So much of it was being my ken, but it was so funny smart (my favorite kind of funny) that I truly enjoyed it.",1455148800,,110,3.625

7125577,5,B00W7AGUBY,"Not exactly what I expected. Star talk, means people not distant suns. But good and thoughtful, sound bite discussions which give you just a taste of thinking about the issues in life. If it encourages the masses to THINK, then it's worth it.",1440979200,4,242,4.651162790697675
7125578,5,B00W7AGUBY,"Imagine a world where more people cared about what was going on with the Large Hadron Collider than the Kardasians.  Neil DeGrasse Tyson is to science what Jon Stewart is to politics.  One man with the potential to reignite the public's interest in this most critical of topics.  Whatever you had planned on watching tonight will not possibly enrich your mind like this DVD set.  Dr. Tyson can take something as complex as astrophysics and present it in a way that not only makes sense to the average person, but that will actually make you curious to learn more about it.  If you find yourself even a little bit ""science-curious"" then go ahead and order this DVD.  If you're not 100% convinced, give the free ""Star Talk"" pod-cast a listen.  We need to make science cool again, and this is one heck of a start.",1437436800,14,810,4.544827586206897
