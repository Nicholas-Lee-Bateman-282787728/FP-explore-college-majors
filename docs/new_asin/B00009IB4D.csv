7990779,3,B00009IB4D,Kam Yin Fei is the underrated performance in this chop-sockey film. She has a skill and intensity that puts the male actors to shame. Her mantis fist and eagle claw choreography is worth the viewing time.,1419638400,,204,4.694444444444445

7990781,5,B00009IB4D,One of the best movies I've watched. I'm a huge Kung Fu movie fan and I watch them all the time and have since I was a kid with my brother and cousins.,1395187200,,151,3.606060606060606
7990782,4,B00009IB4D,"This was a solid kung fu movie. At first, the slapstick scenes were annoying me, but as the plot unfolded, I cared what was happening.  That's not always the case with this genre... sometimes the story is just filler between fight scenes.  And this one had some amazing ones.  There were slow parts, but the revelations about some of the character relationships towards the end really make it interesting.  As another reviewer mentioned, the choreography is soooo good in this.  Kam Yin-Fei, and Ting Wa-Chung are so cool to watch fight vs, and side-by-side.  I especially liked  Kam Yin-Fei, as she's like a lightning fast robot, and super cute.  I love the hilarious dubbing and the awkward cuts in these movies.  This one has some good ones, but it's not completely riddled with them.

Overall, great for anyone who finds all the quirkiness of 70's and 80's kung fu productions endearing, and wants to see one with a little more plot substance than most.  I only gave it four stars for some of the slow parts and a bit of the ol' unfunny intentional humor.  I seem never to laugh at the parts that are intentionally funny, though.  See it!",1390694400,,1142,4.65
7990783,2,B00009IB4D,"Picture was very grainy. Acting wasn't great. Story was decent but lacked quality due to bad actors.
For an old movie was okay, would be considered a flop by todays standards.",1360454400,,175,4.67741935483871
7990784,4,B00009IB4D,"This is a very engaging movie.  The story itself is alright.  It's about an orphan named Xiao Hai, played by Ting Wa-Chung, who is raised by a crime boss played by Lung Fei, and begins to learn the Chicken fist when he falls for a girl who is a mantis fist expert, played by Kam Yin-Fei.
The reason to get this film is the fight coreography.  While it kind of looks undercranked, it's not obvious, unlike some of those Alexander Lo Rei 'Ninja' films during the 80's.  And the treat is watching Kam Yin-Fei.  She is AWESOME.  Not only does she have a lot of power, reminiscent of Michelle Yeoh's on-screen fighting, but she's also very acrobatic.  She does as many flips and leg sweeps as the lead character Xiao.  Xiao is not a very sympathetic character, but he is a great on-screen fighter and verry acrobatic.  He does multiple flips in one spot, not unlike Li Yi Min in some of his films.  Lung Fei is also great, but there is some body doubling when his character does some flips.
The downside of this DVD is the picture quality.  It is full screen and looks like it was taken from a VHS source.  I also had a problem with the sound effects during the fight scenes, but I think that was more a fault of the original makers of the films.  Some of the body blows, for instance, had the same sound effect as the 'slap' sound made when one guy blocks a hit with his arms.  You realize how important proper sound effects are to making a fight work in a kung fu film.
The special features are interesting, but nothing special.  Gordon Liu's interview isn't very enlightening.  It's rather distracting that the voice doing the translating only picks out every other sentence (it's like he only had one shot at translating), he translates for both the interviewer AND Liu, and in his British accent, he sometimes throws in British terms, like 'bloke'.  The demonstration of Hung Gar is interesting, but is more for show than actual learning value.
Overall, the film deserves a 5.  The fight coreography is well paced and top notch.  And watch for the girl.  It's a wonder why she didn't do any other kung fu films of note.  She could have been another Moon Lee or Michelle Yeoh if she was doing her thing in the late 80's.  'Death Duel Of Mantis' - a film you shouldn't pass up on.",1064188800,6,2278,4.4124700239808154
