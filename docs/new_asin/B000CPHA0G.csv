8100085,5,B000CPHA0G,"WOW! That's what I thought when I saw this series. I have seen a great many anime series, lots of them end up falling through the cracks and collect dust on my shelf. This one is a unrecognized gem that I don't see myself having to dust off very frequently. I have been collecting anime for 15 years and I just stumbled onto this one by accident. It's great. It is the story of 6 women living in Hokkaido. They all lead very different lives, but they share a common bond. Even though these girls have never met they are tied together by their aching hearts. Each girl is given 2 episodes to encounter a problem and find a solution. I think that a few of them are better than the others.

ATSUKO is a 20 year old girl who works at her family's fish market with her Mom. Her Father passed away and left them in debt. They may have to sell the market to pay off the debt. Atsuko was promised to a young man with tons of money. He really loves Atsuko and tries to do what he can to win her affection and save her market, but Atsuko resents being forced into a marriage that she doesn't choose. She meets a man that is in his 30's and plays sax at a jazz club. She finds his way of life refreshing and liberating. She is torn between doing what is going to make her family happy and following her heart.

KARIN has a medical condition that requires surgery. She is scared and doesn't want to go through with it. Her Father died on the operating table when she was a small girl. She lays around in the hospital putting off the inevitable. She gets encouragement from her loving brother, her doctor, and a secret admirer on the internet. She falls in love with her doctor and begins to discover that she isn't alone. The people around her may give her the strength to go on living.

I actually have the complete collection that contains all 6 stories. This is probably the best of the 3 volumes though. Atsuko and Karin are my favorite stories, along with the final story of Akari. If you just get any of the 3 volumes you can still enjoy them. All 6 of the stories are unrelated so you can buy any of the individual volumes and be happy. I recommend getting the entire series though.",1352937600,,2177,4.240963855421687
8100086,4,B000CPHA0G,"This unusual story follows the lives of six young women, of various ages, living on or visiting the Japanese island of Hokkaido. The characters have little in common at first, other than dreams of love and happiness, symbolized by the magic of diamond dust, a winter phenomenon that is supposed to ensure happiness to those who see it.
The first story is of Atsuko, a twenty year old living with her mother and helping run the family business. She feels trapped by her family's financial circumstances and  a approaching arranged marriage, when a stranger enters her life. She finds herself drawing closer to this man, but is he truly the answer to her problem?
The second story involves Karin, a girl of about fifteen who's been hospitalized with a life threatening ailment. In order to avoid dealing with her problems, she escapes into a web blog where she documents her dreams. She eventually acquires an ardent fan, and has hopes of romance. But before the story ends, she must face disappointment, along with some unpleasant truths about herself.
The production quality of this series is quite good, and the voice casting isn't bad at all. The stories themselves don't have simple happy endings, but both characters find reason for hope, which makes the whole thing pleasant to watch. Female angst is not everyone's cup of tea, but a bit of patience with this story can definitely pay off. Take a chance, Columbus did.",1212710400,3,1423,4.8559670781893
8100087,4,B000CPHA0G,"The unrelated stories of Diamond Daydreams have more in common then what your lead to believe. For one all of them have a deceased father but only Karin seems to be really effected by this. Another is that these girls are young teens and the guys they fall for are grown men but so far only one man understands that problem. Everyone seems to have a different take on what diamond dust actually does but one is that the person you see it with is your true love. The style and story of this series can sometimes feel like a soap opera and though it can get a little girly you start to get hooked into the unique plot.

I have to say that Diamond Daydreams is starting to impress me because I already have no idea where the story is going but I like that surprise feeling of every episode. Every two episodes there's a new girl to find out about and they'll continue this until the sixth girl is introduced. I'm very curious to see how they get these girls to meet up. My only problem with this series are some of the scenes are boring and ineffective and it makes you wonder about the future episodes potential. The settings are great and the animation is perfect for this style, maybe this series will exceed my expectations.",1147305600,6,1225,4.349344978165939
