2823838,5,B000PITXRS,i seen this concert in l.a. it was great i love operation mindcrime....omc 2 im not a huge fan of but it was great in concert. dio showed up for a song and he is on this dvd also he sounded as good as ever. the acting on stage was just so so for me...it helps tell a story that i already know well. i forgot the name of the singer who is mary but she is back for both om1 and 2 and she still sings gr8.  i'll be buying this dvd when it comes out for sure.,1181001600,,455,3.595959595959596
2823849,3,B000PITXRS,"Well, lets start with general impressions. Overall this is a good DVD. The sound is great and the video is great. The band pulls off both Mindcrime discs very well live. It's true that Geoff Tates voice has had better days, but he sounds a lot better on this than he did on Live Evolution. However, his acting leaves much to be desired. I don't know why he decided to sport the Madonna microphone and act out parts of the show. He kind of reminded me of Meat Loaf in The Rocky Horror Picture Show. But like I said, overall this is a great disc for Queensryche fans. I highly recommend it.",1246406400,,588,4.258928571428571
2823850,5,B000PITXRS,"I really like this DVD. I got it for Christmas ('08) and have watched it twice. The playing is great. Tate's voice is pretty good for the most part. True, he is a bit over the top and corny at times. But it still works. As for the political commentary, get over it people, that's part of the story (listen to the songs themselves). And yes, muscicians, just like the rest of us have a right to their opinions. You have the right not to listen. I happen to agree with the views presented on stage. But if I didn't I would either choose not to watch or just ignore it. For instance, you won't ever catch me at a Toby Keith concert! LOL. Well, besides his political views, his songs pretty much suck:) Anyway, if you are a fan of Mindcrime, get this.",1238976000,,747,4.194444444444445
2823851,2,B000PITXRS,"First of all, I'll give my 'positives' regarding this DVD. Mike Stone is a great guitar player...way better than Kelly Grey. Stone does a very good job on the lead work that Grey simply could not do on 'Live Evolution'. Also, using Pamela Moore to do background vocals is a plus as well.

However, the production (sound, lighting, camera work) is not nearly as good as 'Evolution'. Understanding that Tate and company are telling a story here, there is too much theatrics which takes away from the music, and Tate himself does not do very well vocally.

As a long time fan, I always considered Queensryche to be a band with a lot of professional class...they stood out from the rest. I suppose when Degarmo left, all of that went with him. I was quite frankly shocked by the profanity, and specifically, the pervasive use of the 'F' word and the middle finger salute throughout the production. I will never understand artists and actors who feel like using such language enhances the story. I suppose that it shows their true character as individuals.

Tate has always been somewhat arrogant, and it is also obviously clear where he stands on his political views. This story could have been told without him sharing his with the rest of us. The poster disgracing Bush at the beginning of the show was tacky, tasteless, disrespectful, and just plain filthy. As I stated, this behavior stunned me, and to say the least, disappointed me. Tate has no integrity and definitely lacks character.

Had I known all of this beforehand, I would not have purchased it. I know my review means nothing, and will more than likely not have any affect. I just felt like I had to give my honest opinion. To the true Ryche fan who soaks up their music, this is a disappointment.",1237593600,11,1759,4.664516129032258
2823852,4,B000PITXRS,"One thing that I have learned over the years is that it is very difficult to capture the same energy, audio and visual effects of a live show on a taped performance. Although I wasn't there, I have a feeling that the flat vocals were largely due to that fact. I have been to several live shows that were mind blowing only to see the same performance on DVD and find that the singers sounded like they were in their bathroom singing. I'm a diehard fan of Queensryche and Dio so they can do no wrong. I'm sure that the experience of the show was epic but the DVD left me wishing I was there.",1222732800,,589,4.130434782608695
2823853,5,B000PITXRS,"Of all of the concert DVDs that I own, or have seen, Mindcrime At The Moore is definitely my most favorite! I've been a Queensryche fan ever since the early '90s, after the release of ""Empire"", & I've seen them twice in concert, even though they were the opening act. I love Mindcrime At The Moore for tons of reasons: all 34 songs in the concert, live actors play the parts of the characters, there's different set & costume changes, lots of props, Pamela Moore, who plays Sister Mary, is in OMC1 longer than on Operation LIVECrime & she's also in OMC2, there's a video screen in the back of the stage, showing scenes that highlight the storyline and the band, themselves, are front & center, on stage & play magnificently! Also, even though Chris DeGarmo's not with them, anymore, the guitarist that replaced him, Mike Stone, does a fantastic job on guitar! Plus, we answer these questions: ""What happened to Mary?"" & ""Whatever happened to Nicky?"" I also like the bonus features, especially the tour documentary. This is a terrific concert DVD set & I recommend it to all Queensryche fans or fans of heavy metal, in general, because, believe me, it is fabulous and everyone involved in it hit a grand slam!",1210809600,,1208,4.649532710280374
2823854,5,B000PITXRS,"I received my Mindcrime DVD yesterday and watched it last night - what a treat! I'll watch it over and over. Unlike one of the other reviewers, I found the political messages pertinent - I think it shows that the original story is in fact timeless. War, money, corruption, exploitation, longing, remorse - it all makes for great drama! Also, in traditional opera or theatre, the musicians are in the pit and invisible to the audience. In Mindcrime, the musicians are front and center on stage - powerful! I would recommend this DVD especially to today's teens; current bands don't do concept albums or theatrical performances any more - what a shame.",1193961600,,650,4.8125
2823855,5,B000PITXRS,"I loved the original mindcrime , I loved the livecrime release , damm it I loved Rage for Order Empire , Promised Land but somewhere around the HITNF and Tribe I fell away from the 'ryche . Sure I still watched Livecrime and loved it from time to time , but the new stuff didn't do it for me. I watched with interest and a little disdain at the repeated reissues of various incarnations and packages of the Mindcrime set . Finally news came of Mindcrime 2 and I purchased it on the day of release. I was disapointed with it , terribly disapointed , I just couldn't access it like the Mindcrime 1 , I listened to it maybe 3 or 4 times no more . When the DVD wa sissued I wasn't so fast in buying it but for some reason a month or so after its release I went out and got it. What can I say I sat there with the home theatre sytem blasting it out and loved it , from the opening bars to the closing encores this is one hell of a concert , the band sound great , Geoff tates voice may not eb quite as strong as it was 20 years ago , but whose is ? He still has one of the most classical and distinctive vocals of any singer  . This is a truly great performance , well filmed and produced and for any Queensryche fan it is a must have , any lover of hard rock will also love it . I cant get enough of this DVD and watch it repeatedly , finally I now get Mindcrime 2 !",1191283200,3,1362,3.8297872340425534
2823856,5,B000PITXRS,"This DVD more than fufilled my expectations. Great performances of some of the best tunes I know.

Yes Geoff Tate was a little bit of a ham - but it worked and worked well. I don't understand what people expect. Enjoy the band, enjoy the songs, enjoy the spectacle - and relax already!",1189814400,,285,4.377358490566038
2823857,4,B000PITXRS,"This is an excellent compilation Video DVD of Operation Mindcrime I and II. The picture clarity and sound is outstanding. It felt like I was at a play. I would rate the entire DVD excellent, but I can't. Their anti-Bush/anti-Iraq gestures prevent me from doing so, but it's great entertainment. When will these groups learn that no one cares about their political opinions. If you love Queensryche's music, then this is a must-have DVD for your collection. As for the anti-Bush signs and gestures, just remember that these bands are misguided, and don't know what the heck their talking about when it comes policy. I'm pro-Bush all the way, and nothing I've seen on this DVD will ever change that! He and I believe in the same thing - lets skin these terrorist cowards alive. Kill em' all I say.",1189641600,6,795,4.685714285714286
2823858,3,B000PITXRS,"Well I thought this would be a good addition to our concert dvd collection to listen to in our in home bar.  While I love Queensryche, I have never seen them in concert and therefore was not aware their stage show is more like going to a play. I have gone to a lot of concerts and have not seen acting on stage.  I guess some of you die hards like my husband expected it but it was distracting to me.  It was hard to enjoy the beautiful, creative songs while watching such bad acting. And might I add that I felt as though ALL of the songs were lipsynched because the vocals were just too exact and sounded exactly the recorded versions.  Bottom line, I would've rather played their cd's on my ipod than watch the heavy metal soap opera.",1188000000,2,737,4.205673758865248
2823859,5,B000PITXRS,"Woow,, Nice guitar play, nice quality, nice theater and the best of all is Geoff Tate, his voice.. woow he sang like the old days, like the studio version of Operation Mindcrime I!! and his acting along with Pamela Moore,, they are terrific.. he is indeed an artist..
For those who've left queensryche for the past years come back,,",1187740800,,332,4.6440677966101696
2823860,5,B000PITXRS,"This DVD is an amazing performance of both Mindcrime albums performed in their entirety.
A must have for any Prog/Metal fans !!!!!!!!",1187740800,,133,5.090909090909091
2823861,3,B000PITXRS,"I have to echo some of the other sentiments I've read here: I'm a fan, and I had great expectations for this concert.  But the truth is, it's really just an average performance of admittedly-great material.

The first thing you can't help but notice is that Geoff Tate's voice just ain't what it used to be.  I always thought Pamela Moore (as Sister Mary) was a fine addition the original Mindcrime performances.  But using her to help Tate hit the high notes just doesn't make sense. . .her voice is deeper than his!

Sadly, the problems don't end there.  I've got a pretty decent surround-sound system, and played both discs with the 5.1 surround option on.  But it's often hard to make out what Moore or the rest of the band (besides Tate, I mean) is singing.  I think the DVD's producers picked up on this, because there are many instances when the lyrics being sung by background singers flash on the screen--a sort of forced subtitling.  And while we're on that subject for a moment, I found much of the editing to be distracting.

On the plus side, using live actors in addition to the 18 year-old original Mindcrime video footage does bring a certain urgency to the story, something that video screens alone could never do.  Even if you know it's coming, the death of Mary is a graphic shock that you'll not soon forget.  Geoff Tate overacts like mad, yet it somehow works within the framework of the story.

Mindcrime 2 vs. Mindcrime 1?  Well, it just depends on your own taste.  If you liked the 2nd album, you'll probably like seeing it live.  I'm a big Queensryche fan, but I couldn't give a crap about Ronnie James Dio, so it didn't bother me that his contribution was relegated to a video screen.  My personal feelings about OM2 were that there was way too much Sister Mary, and I felt the same way about the live performance.

Bottom line: If you're a fan, it might be worth it.  However, you may have noticed a number of fans here that were disapppointed.  I would suggest renting it first if you can.",1187654400,9,2017,4.5041322314049586
2823862,4,B000PITXRS,"Being on a tight budget as I am I knew I should have waited to buy this, but I couldn't resist. I have long been a mindcrime fanatic, I have listened to part one probably more times than should be allowed by law, and part two, while not quite as good is a thoroughly good front to back album.

I will say the first act was an energizing preformance, it had an engaging mix of music, acting and visual arts that had me singing with every song. The Seattle Seahawks drum corps was an excellent addition and Mary's suicide made my heart skip a beat.

It was hard not to watch the second act after watching the first, but unfortunantly after One Foot in Hell the energy really begins to leave the stage. The cover of the DVD stated that ""the Chase"" was preformed with Ronnie James Dio, but unfortunatly for that song neither Dio nore Geoff Tate are present on stage. After ""the Chase"", the remaining part of the preformance begins to bog down and I found myself waiting for Nikki to committ suicide so I could hear ""Jet City Woman"" from the encore.

Overall I would give this four stars. Five for the outstanding preformance from Disk one. Disk Two gets three, losing one for promising and failing to deliver Dio in person and and another for a gradually declining preformace towards the end of disk two.",1187654400,,1300,4.430962343096234
2823863,5,B000PITXRS,"This DVD is an excellent performance of both Mindcrime albums performed in their entirety.  With live actors and video recordings highlighting the storyline, the vision of MindCrime comes to life.  The only problems a true fan of Queensryche and Mindcrime should have with this performance is that DeGarmo is no longer with the band and ""The Chase"" isn't performed live.

The 1st Disc is Mindcrime I, and its the best of this 2 disc set.  People might argue about Tate's vocal performance, but you have to have an understanding of what is going on with this performance.  First of all 15+ years have gone by since Mindcrime I was orginally released, so after performing these songs for so long and looking back on the original vision with more experienced eyes they have re-envisioned the vision.  Think George Lucas and his countless revisions of the Original Star Wars Trilogy.  In otherwords, this is a new arrangement of MindCrime I, both vocally and musically.  Secondly, and most importantly, this isn't Tate singing MindCrime in the studio, this isn't Tate performing at a standard live venue like LIVEcrime, this is Tate ACTING out Mindcrime in a Rock Opera, which is the true and absolute realization of a compilation album, which MindCrime is.  In my opinion Tate does a very good job at affecting his voice to evoke emotion, so that you truly feel what Nicky is going through; you hear the anger, you hear the sadness, and you hear the pain.  This performance is what I have always envisioned Mindcrime I to be.

The 2nd disc, is MindCrime II and the bonus stuff.  MindCrime II is more of your standard rock performance than the opera vision of MindCrime I, but you still get the emotion of the story from Tate's and Pamela's vocals.  Though not as good as MindCrime I, MindCrime II still offers a great vision, and great songs/performances.  My only disappointment with the MindCrime II performance is that the vocals of ""the chase"" are not performed live, instead a video recording of Tate and Dio singing is played while the band plays live.  Sad, but at least one of the bonus features is footage of ""the chase"" performed live at another venue.  Other good bonus matierial in this DVD set are the encore performances of ""walk in the shadows"" and ""jet city woman"", and a tour documentary.",1187568000,,2302,4.775252525252525
2823864,5,B000PITXRS,"I know I'm late, but I finally got around to watching this DVD. I've been a fan of this material since 1988's original release, and I've got to say this is the definitive version of the Mindcrime saga.

Some have talked about the somewhat 'flat' sound of the band in the recording, but take a look at the venue. For Operation: LIVECrime, the setting was a massive arena that the band could barely see each other from the stage-wings and mountains of speakers. Here, The Moore is a much more intimate setting, nearly that of a club gig. Of course the sound will be different. I, personally, like the smaller, ""group of friends"" flavor of this version.

I like the fact that they answered the two big questions for O:M and O:MII - What happened to Mary, and what happened to Nicky. I can imagine some folks don't like that the 'mystery' was revealed, but it just adds to story.

Geoff Tate's still got the vocal range that makes him such a stand-out in the field of rock, and the band hasn't lost a step. Sure, having Chris deGarmo would have been cool, but Mike Stone is no slouch and Michael Wilton is magnificent. Scott Rockenfeld and Eddie Jackson get there moments to shine, and they don't disappoint.

The addition of the Seahawks drum corps a couple of times is a lot of fun.  Pamela Moore still absolutely delivers as Sister Mary and Christen Sorensen (no relation that I know of) is both creepy and believable as Nicky.

The one minor complaint I'd give is that they could have recorded this when Ronnie James Dio was available to reprise his duet with Tate on 'The Chase,' but they even smooth this over by adding the one live Dio performance of the song as a DVD extra.

I really dig the fact that this is produced and presented as a true stage musical, with the band acting as sort of the chorus/narrator from old Greek theatre. It's just a great show that is so much more than just a concert.

If you're a fan of the band, or a fan of Mindcrime, you'll definitely want this in your collection. If you're a fan of great stories told with music, grab this up today.",1187395200,2,2074,4.4109947643979055
2823865,4,B000PITXRS,"Like many other reviewers, I was introduced to Queensrche back in '83, and have seen them five times now (including this past tour). I picked up this DVD because this show was not disappointing. However, the sound just isn't the same without Chris DeGarmo. Mike Stone's performance is not bad, but there are times where his particular style tends to clash with everyone else. Another reviewer likened Geoff Tate's acting skills to that of William Shatner, I couldn't agree more, on the other hand, William Shatner can't sing like Geoff Tate.

I think for me to fully enjoy the live performances of Mindcrime I and II, I've been toying around with the idea of just watching Livecrime followed by Mindcrime at the Moore (Part II). I was blown away when I saw the original Livecrime during the Empire tour, and it still ranks as one of the highest on my list of shows I've seen (Pink Floyd, SRV, Metallica, and Judas Priest are included in that list).

Another disappointing part of the tour was the absence of Ronnie James Dio. Although I know it was a bit much for him to go on a lengthy tour for a measly 3-minute segment, it would have been cool to see him perform ""The Chase"" live instead of the pre-recorded version. It would have been even better if they were on tour together since I've only seen Dio on video (Sacred Heart Tour).

Overall, for the die-hard Queensrche fan, this is one to add to the collection. In my opinion, the original Operation Mindcrime will definitely withstand the test of time, Mindcrime II, on the other hand, like any other sequel, loses something that can only be found in the original. Mindrime II is a fair album, and seeing it performed live helps, but it's not one of Queensrche's best efforts.",1187136000,13,1732,4.616883116883117
2823866,5,B000PITXRS,Absolutely amazing. that's the only way to describe this DVD  A must have for any Queensryche fans.,1187136000,,99,4.823529411764706
2823867,4,B000PITXRS,"I saw Queensryche on the Empire tour and have been a big fan ever since the EP from 1983. I think this is a pretty good performance of both Mindcrimes. Geoff Tate's voice sounds great (I don't know if it was the way it was shot, but it looked like he was lip syncing alot)and Mike Stone does an admirable job of playing Chris Degarmos's leads from the first Mindcrime. I was disappointed that Dio was not there live, even though it was just the one track. But Pamela Moore (is she so hot they named the theater after her?)has a huge part and does a great job as Sister Mary. I did throw on the  Livecrime video and did find the energy level on that to be a bit better, but all in all ""Mindcrime at the Moore"" is a fine live performance.",1186963200,,736,4.111111111111111
2823868,4,B000PITXRS,"I have followed Queensryche since 1991's Empire. I was a kid at Christmas when I got the original Mindcrime video from the Empire tour. Like allot of people I was apprehensive to get this DVD. I wasn't shy about my dislike of the Live Evolution album and Q2k. Tribe was a step in the right direction but still kind of lacking.

My wife convinced me to buy this and I am glad she did. The first disk is a masterwork performance. I love the alternate arrangements on some of the songa and all of the band performs well including Mike Stone. Is he Degarmo? No nobody really is but I can assure you he is a BIG improvement over Kelly Gray and a much better fit for Queensryche. He plays very well by his own standard. Geoff sounds great and Pamela Moore adds a nice vocal dimension to the performances. Scott, Michael, and Ed add the pedal to the metal I have come to expect from this band.

Now I'll admidt Mindcrime II just doesn't have the power of of the original but there are some good momments there as well like the chase, signs say go, and I'm an American. Overall though it compliments the first story well and makes Mindcrime a complete and exciting treat for this recharged Queensryche fan.

Five stars for disk one and three stars for disk two so that means a very well done four star performance.",1186876800,,1306,4.366255144032922
2823869,5,B000PITXRS,"E' dai tempi del tour di ""empire"" che non vedevo i queensryche cos in gran forma, questo dvd per me  il migliore di tutta la loro carriera, e la consacrazione di una band, dopo questo dvd si pu tranquillamente dire che i queenssryche sono entrati nella storia del grande rock come i Deep purple, led zeppelin e thin lizzy negli anni settanta.
I queensryche sempre si sono distinti dagli altri gruppi del loro genere, Geoff Tate  uno dei pi importanti vocalists di tutti i tempi.
Questo dvd  musica e teatro, la collaborazione pi stretta con Pamela Moore rende questo dvd imperdibile.
Una sola nota negativa, purtroppo nella composizione della seconda parte si sente l'assenza di Chris De Garmo,Mike Stone  un grande chitarrista, ma Chris De Garmo per me era fondamentale per la band, hanno perso la parte pi melodoca, che era a mio parere molto importante in questo gruppo!",1186790400,,873,4.8389261744966445
2823870,3,B000PITXRS,"Sorry!!  I'm a huge Queensryche fan, and ordered my copy of ""Mindcrime at the Moore"" before it was even available.  Though packaged nicely, I was disappointed by the performance.  As a review, I'd say that it is a flat ""dinner theater"" performance of one of the best hard rock / heavy metal records ever released...plus the second disc whose only crime is delivering a ""more of the same"" performance to us consumers.  The passion is just not there.  I'd recommend finding a DVD of the original ""Operation: Livecrime""...There are still a few floating around out there...It is freakin' awesome!!",1186617600,4,593,4.94949494949495
2823871,3,B000PITXRS,"I have been a Queensryche fan since the first E.P.way back in 83.
Mindcrime, to me was and is the finest concept piece of music ever written. I spent months pouring over every note, every vocal line, and every lyric. Geoff Tate is the reason I am a singer.
I bought this DVD with the hopes of a kind of closure from the concept. a complete telling of the story. What i got was a bizarre stage performance, with Tate less acting like the virtuoso singer he is, and more like William Shatner. I hate writing this as much as you hate reading it.....
In alot of ways, it is great; musically, the band has never been better. Stone  and Wilton rip the songs into shreds with lightning riffs and major props to Stone's respectful adherance to Degarmo's playing on Mindcrime 1.
Ed Bass is great at holding the bottom end as well as the backing vocals in the higher registers.
Rockinfield is his usual professional amazing self, lighting the songs up with tight beats and eloquent fills.
Pamela Moore shines vocally as well, adding much more voice to the totality of the set.
No, the real problem here is Tate himself..His need to dumb down the story by explaining every nuance is almost insulting to me. Having read the lyrics to both discs, I thought it obvious the story, and did not think we as fans needed our hands held as Tate walked us through every step of the tale.
His voice seems shaky at times, and I can olny imagine it is due to all the poor acting he is struggling through instead of simply being a lead singer in one of the greatest progressive rock bands ever...
Again, I love Queensryche. I have a mindcrime logo inked on my calf. I have always styled my voice and songwriting in the queensryche vein. Yet, I cannot really reccomend this to a true fan of the band and of the Mindcrime story...This West Side Story version is too much to take.
Buy Operation Livecrime. I put it in after about 30 minutes of Mindcrime at the Moore, and thought to myself ""Ah, ok, here is the real Mindcrime""..
Allen Dean, The r. A.d. Project..google me!",1186531200,6,2044,4.4361702127659575
2823872,3,B000PITXRS,"The quality of this DVD is great overall. The picture is really good and the sound is OK althugh the mix itself could be a bit better. To my ears the vocals are mixed way too loud and sometimes end up ""on top"" of the music without really blending in. Besides this I like the sound though.

The performance itself is cool with live actors on stage and all the Mindcrime-songs played in their entirety. Some of the songs have been re-arranged which sometimes works really well and sometimes not so well. Tate struggles with some of the notes but overall he sings really well. The band plays solid as usual.

However, compared to the performance on ""Operation: Livecrime"" this one's not so exciting. I'm one of those who really misses DeGarmo... He brought A LOT to the table that Mike Stone just doesn't. For example I hate it the way he has changed DeGarmo's parts in the duelling guitarsolos. They don't fit at all with Wilton's parts. The list could be made longer but I won't go into that here.

The bonus material is pretty cool, especially the documentary about this particular performance. It's always nice to get an ""inside glimpse"".",1186444800,3,1139,4.628712871287129
2823873,5,B000PITXRS,"I always liked to see Queenryche perform. OM-II live is a cool continuation to OM-I.
OM-I was always great to watch but it's nice to see a fresh performance of it. I also have the older versions...

It also comes with a few songs as a bonus.

I wish it had subtitles option as well...

Highly recommanded!",1186358400,,305,4.315789473684211
2823874,5,B000PITXRS,"I was lucky enough to attend the shows Mindcrime At The Moore were recorded at, even the one where Ronnie James Dio made his only live performance. This tour (10 shows attended) totally blew me away and I couldn't be happier that Queensryche decided to film it all live for this DVD. They've come full circle with Operation: Mindcrime and it was a much welcomed release to all who are fans of the story.

I'm no music, mixing, guitar expert by any means, I just know what sounds good to me. The band is tight, the sound is amazing and the on stage acting was passionate and riveting. Geoff Tate's vocals are very strong and as one of the best vocalists of all time IMO, he still has that ""it"" factor. Pamela Moore does a wonderful job as Sister Mary. To the delight of the fans (especially the guys, she's HOT!) they utilize her talent quite a bit and I couldn't be happier about that. An amazing beauty which is only surpassed by that strong, rich voice of hers. Michael Wilton (guitar), Mike Stone (guitar), Eddie Jackson (bass) and Scott Rockenfield (drums) do what they do best and each is a master at his craft. The Seattle Seahawks Blue Thunder Drumline marches out and performs ""Anarchy-X"" with the band, which gets you whipped into a frenzy right from the start. All the way this DVD is filled with hard rockin' heart pumping music by the most talented of musicians, drama, tragedy, love, pain, rock, revenge, redemption, surprises and Moore!

The bonus features are cool with a tour documentary that gives a glimpse into the preperations for this amazing tour.

I wholeheartedly recommend the Mindcrime At The Moore DVD and CD to everyone. An absolute MUST HAVE for Rychers and a great release to convert someone to the Ryche side!

BUY IT NOW and enjoy it TODAY!",1186272000,2,1772,4.598101265822785
2823875,4,B000PITXRS,"Queensryche still sounds great. Geoff Tate especially still sounds terrific. He hasn't lost a thing over the years. As for the production, it was just OK in my opinion. The stage at my high school was bigger than the one they performed on, and the little skits they performed reminded me of a high school play. I also miss Chris DeGarmo on guitar. The guy they had was good, but anyone who has seen ""Operation: Livecrime"" knows that no one plays that part better than Degarmo. Still. I gave it 4 stars. A very good concert.",1185494400,,523,4.458333333333333
2823876,4,B000PITXRS,"Well I finally gave in and bought this Dvd. As a longtime fan whose fanship of Ryche has been recently been rekindled, I was looking forward to seeing this more theatrical presentation of one of the greatest albums of all time. Also, as an added bonus, Mindcrime's underwhelming sequel is peformed live in its entirely as well.

Prog-nosis (couldn't resist haha): Mindcrime 1's live performance is not up to par compared to Livecrime. The Rhythm section performs tightly, and ironically, Mike Wilton is probably in better shape guitar wise than on the original live album. His leads and warm tone benefit the band greatly (I wish he would write more). However, Mike Stone is very sloppy when playing much of the Degarmo leads, and adds unneccesary embellishments at times (example: the bluesy out of place lead at the end of Suite Sister Mary). His image is like a lost cousin of Phil Anselmo (with a mohawk) circa 1992, but thats not what grates on me. He has a very nervous approach to vibrato that doesn't compare to the smoother playing of Degarmo (and believe me, he is designated many of Degarmo's original leads). That said, some of the arrangements of the original album are embellished in new and novel ways (example: Empty Room), and this is actually welcomed as some of these interludes are fleshed out to somewhat regular songs. The theatrics are great, but Geoff Tate seems to be the perfect fit for Nikki, despite the younger actor playing the more drugged up Nikki.

Vocalwise: Geoff starts out very shakily on the performance of Mindcrime I. He strains with many of the notes, and Pamela Moore actually sings a lot more this time around on many of the old songs and higher parts. By the second half of Mindcrime I however, he is back to much of his original game and sounds very impassioned.

One other thing that annoyed me with the performance of Mindcrime I was the drum sound. It was flat, and overcompressed (very late nineties sounding) compared to the original performances. That may be because of the Tv I was watching it on, or that I don't have dolby surround speakers, but there was definitely something amiss as far as this element. Performance wise though it was great.

Overall the performance of Mindcrime I is decent, but not great.

Mindcrime II: The performance of Mindcrime II, in my opinion, is better than the album that was released with the same name.

The performances are a lot more comprehensible, and it benefits from an overall better mix and mastering. The album Mindcrime II had a very muddy, overcompressed production (Rockenfield's drums are ironically better this time around as well), and I don't think that Tate was up to par on the album either.

However, this was the real surprise: Mindcrime II's performance outshines the actual album, and the mix and production is 100 % better as well!

I also thought Mike Stone fit the second album better, as he wrote much of it, and his leads actually benefit from being in a live setting. A better and less sloppy performance of an album that was muddy and sloppy in comparison! Very strange indeed.

Geoff Tate sounded in prime form on the second dvd as well, and his theatrics (along with the others) were very entertaining.

So the question is, is this worth getting? I would say that people who just detest any Queensryche (recording, live or otherwise) after 1994 could probably stay away and not miss much. I would say that people who want to see a band slowly regaining their fire and also hear a better version of a mediocre album could buy this and be very satisfied.

Its a long way (BACK) to the top for the band, but if the Mindcrime II performance (on this dvd) is any indication, they are definitely headed in the right direction even moore (haha).",1184803200,,3757,4.711890243902439
2823877,5,B000PITXRS,"You can read my thoughts on the stuDIO version of OM 2 in the review section of that cd.

This live dvd is perfect.  Perfectly performed, great sounding, origingal staging and just great music to pull from.

Having been a fan of QR since THE WARNING, you expect me to tell you how great this is...and you'd be right.  I was there for the LA show when RONNIE JAMES DIO played ""The Vhase"" with the band and it was electrifying.

I just love this dvd..the tour doc in the bonus section is worth the price of this alone...the bacstage with DIO footage is classic as well.
Just another great QR product.",1184716800,,598,4.351351351351352
2823878,4,B000PITXRS,"Before I start my review and analizes I want to make one thing clear is that I am not a huge Queensryche fan.  I have always liked the story of Operation Mindcrime 1 & 2 and was thrilled that they performed both parts live in concert.  I do respect the talents of all of the band members especially the Vocals of Geoff Tate.

I attended a show on this tour and was totally blown away.  In fact it was one of the greatest shows I have ever saw in my life.  I was thinking all throught the show I hope that they film this for either a DVD release and/or an audio release. Now on to my review.

This DVD captures the raw energy of the performance and the audience.  Geoff Tate never sounded better.  Sure he can no longer hit the high notes which in is case is good because in the early days all he did was wail instead of sing.  Pamela Moore was excellent as well.  The camera angles are both good and annoying.  I felt that the camera moved to much in some places and din't move enough in others.

The sound quality was mixed as well.  In some areas Geoff Tate sounded great but in other parts of the DVD he sounded like he was eating the microphone.  Pamela Moores vocals weren't turned up loud enough which was annoying too.

The acting wasn't that good but they still pulled it of anyway.  I have to remember that these arn't professional actors there rock stars.  The drummer, guitar plaer and bass player were really good in there performances as well.

The bonus features are amazing as well.  I like how the band filmed their rehearsals for the upcoming tour.  I also like how they filmed Ronnie James Dio only appearance with the band which was recorded live from Los Angeles.

The bottom line is if you like the story of both operation mindcrime 1 & 2 you'll love this DVD.

This DVD is also a great addition to anybody who likes concept albums as well.  I will compare this to the genious of Pete Townshend's Tommy!",1184544000,3,1924,4.283333333333333
2823889,4,B000PITXRS,"What a hoot!  I've been a fan of these guys from the beginning, through thick and thin, and this set captures a truly remarkable performance.  My only complain is that the audio quality seems to take a dump in the end of disc two.  Geoff and Pamela sound way overmodulated, and the weird blurry effect that distorts the image of the two is distracting.

The best parts?  ""Suite Sister Mary"" from OMCI and ""Fear City Slide"" from OMCII.

Awesome stuff!",1184284800,,450,4.5625
2823890,5,B000PITXRS,I was ragging on this after I downloaded a copy from the net and watched it on my PC so I burned it and watched it on my LCD W/surround and loved it! In particular the OM2 set which is fresher compared to OM1. Approching 45-50 years old these guys put on a clinic for all you young bands out there to learn from.,1184284800,,312,3.890625
2823891,4,B000PITXRS,"As a longtime QR fan who had high expectations for OM:II and was a little disappointed I purchased this DVD with a bit less fervor. Needless to say I was pleasantly surprised to find a similar (if not more solid) effort than the Livecrime release of 16 years ago. It absolutely made sense for the band to put together a tour that covered the Mindcrime saga in its entirety; however the prospect of combining what was essentially two separate concerts (along with the visuals) given the fact that these guys are well into their 40's seemed a little far fetched. As mentioned in a previous review, this was indeed a massive undertaking. With that in mind, my assessment of the whole DVD experience was going to be much more forgiving than it was after my first listen to the latest studio release.

My findings-good, bad and ugly.

The good: As I alluded to before the coverage of the original Mindcrime release was the most tight I've heard since 1991. Throw in the theatrics and you have a dynamic that was simply absent on ""Live Evolution"" and ""Art of Live"". From the drum corps backing up Scott Rockenfield in Anarchy X to Geoff Tate belting out ""Eyes of a Stranger"" while bound in a straight jacket Disc 1 is worth the price of admission alone. The band nails every song and sprinkles in some creative improvisation (""Electric Requiem"" and ""My Empty Room"") for good measure. Pamela Moore providing backup/harmony effectively augmented Tate's vox-even though he sounded better than he has in years. Additionally, a more animated Tate and company managed to successfully capture their audience rather than just play for them..a testament to this being more than a rushed swan song. Believe me, once the title track kicks in you'll be held captive as well. The best aspects of ""Mindcrime at the Moore"" are borne out in Disc 1, which leads to..

The bad- Actually we'll just say not-so-good. Disc 2 covers the latest release and it can be safely said that Mindcrime II is best experienced live. The passion that was so prevalent in part I does indeed carry over into this segment, however it became quite apparent a few songs into the set that this was headed towards anticlimax. After energizing the crowd for 90 minutes the show seemed to lose some steam-an unfortunate eventuality given an abrupt end to the frenetic pace after ""A Murderer?"". Even with a sound that was as true to (or better than) the studio release, the second installment of the Mindcrime saga live just didn't have the substance to close the deal. Fortunately QR remedied the crowd's hunger with ""Walk in the Shadows"" and ""Jet City Woman"" as encores.

And, the ugly: As much as I appreciate the many faces of Mike Stone I just couldn't digest his look for this show. His Plasmatics-era mohawk and recurrent virtuoso-esqe solo fills seemed quite out of place. Fortunately he holds his own along with Michael Wilton...which didn't happen on ""Live Evolution"". Another forgettable moment was the live rendition of ""The Chase"", sans Ronnie James Dio. Actually, neither Tate nor Dio were present on stage-just a very amateurish and almost laughable video that accompanied the band throughout the number. Understandably, RJD was only able to perform live at the LA show (which is included as a bonus feature on Disc 2) but the video could've been approached very differently (i.e. have a more impassioned Dio on screen with Tate singing live in the foreground).

In sum, given a few shortcomings it can't be overstated that this is without a doubt their finest live release. Considering how this aging band covered material not only conceived almost 20 years ago but comprising the finest metal concept album in history this performance is a must to watch and own.

4 Stars for sure.",1183766400,5,3748,4.812111801242236
2823892,5,B000PITXRS,"simply put - you HAVE TO own this DVD if you even marginally call yourself a Queensryche fan.

The music is tight and they sound as good as they did 20+ years ago (well, you can tell Geoff has aged a little, but not that much)

32 songs for $22!  I ripped the audio from my DVD's and put it on my ipod, it is that good of a production.  My only complaint is that the bass player looks bored and doesn't really get into the music.

Pamela Moore is awesome in her role of Sister Mary.  Even Ronnie James Dio makes an appearance!",1183680000,2,526,4.009615384615385
2823893,5,B000PITXRS,"This is the next best thing to seeing them live, and seeing the queenryche sagas of Mindrime played back to back. Unfortunately, they didn't get them squeezed on one DVD, so you have to stop and change discs unlike a live continuous show, but thats ok. Well worth the money.  Its Livecrime to the max, now with essentially Livecrime 2 expanded on the masterpiece. Must own for a Ryche fan, and definitely should be purchased first before the CD if on limited funds.",1183507200,5,465,4.602409638554217
2823894,5,B000PITXRS,"I have had the privledge of seeing Queensryche 2 years in a row now. And I remember ""Mindcrime 1"" tour. This DVD is awsome. Great to see the Ryche in top form. Plus the bonus with Ronnie James Dio doing ""The Chase."" is excellent. This is a must have for true Ryche fans.",1183507200,2,270,4.113207547169812
2823895,5,B000PITXRS,"For those of you who do not have the DVD, GET IT, particularly if you saw the live show in person during the OMC I and II tour.  It is a fantastic, PROFESSIONALLY captured and edited spectacular, not to mention a high-quality audio track to match!

Seriously, I have watched several ""live"" DVD concerts, but this production beautifully blends the live performance, terrific camera angles and imagery, and post-production editing into what can truly be called a visual and audio masterpiece.  It is meticulous and detailed, capturing the exciting pulse of a live performance without compromising the cinematic story-telling that this saga requires.

And let's face it, you absolutely cannot enjoy this DVD (despite all I have mentioned so far) unless Geoff Tate and the band delivered musically.  Guess what?  THAT'S THE BEST PART!!  Tate sounds terrific!  For the first half, he delivers a powerful, spot-on performance that is every bit as good as Operation LiveCrime!  What chops he still has!  Cripes!

And the band is rock solid --- tight technically and impressive melodically.  Wilton and Stone are superb, and the underpinnings of bass and drums are phenomenal, to boot.

I saw the show in Baltimore and loved it.  The DVD is even better!  It is a worthy chronicle of a band and a story that just won't quit.  I hated waiting so long for this thing, but now I am fulfilled.

Go out and get it.  If you rate it less than a five, you're wound way too tight, dude.",1183507200,7,1468,4.780876494023905
2823896,5,B000PITXRS,This new DVD captures Queensryche performing Operation Mindcrime 1 & II in their entirety. In the process the band defines how a performance DVD should be shot. I caught this tour 5 days before these performances were captured and I tell you that sometimes my mind was playing tricks on me. This DVD almost mimics the vantage point that I had when I saw this tour on October 6th 2006. This is one of the best depictions of a concert experience that I have ever seen. The viewer will really be drawn into the story as the Mindcirme saga unfolds. I do not know if this release will win the band new fans but what a treat for those of us that have stayed true to the band over the years. This is like having my memory of the show burned on to a DVD. I can relive this show anytime I like now. There are some great effects applied but they do not detract from anything. This is not like The Art of Live that was full of sepia tones and filters. I highly recommend this to any Queensryche fan out there. The band was in great form and Geoff Tate hit a home run!,1183420800,22,1056,4.131067961165049
2823897,4,B000PITXRS,"Queensryche returned to their most famous work when they released the somewhat ill received Mindcrime 2. The sequel is similar towards other recent Queensryce releases in that it is much softer and leans more towards the progressive side of music rather than straight heavy metal (as the original MC).

  However, this live CD/DVD should bring many fans to the new release and might win a few MC 2 critics over as well.

  The show featuring over 32 songs (covering both MC and MC2) was a massive effort. The music is also fronted by changing sets, live actors and a myriad of props to help convey the story of the seminal concept albums. Geoff Tate (The lead singer) voice has diminished little over the past years and sounds almost as good as he did in the bands early live works. Singing with such intensity and acting well is something that Tate should be quite proud of, as no other aging metal singer can claim a similar feat.

  There is little in the music world that can compare to Mindcrime at the Moore. The release features great songs, but it is the sheer intensity of the performance that distinguishes it from other similar acts. Rob Halford was quite right when he said that the band was as similar to and opera as it was a metal act.

  Not to be missed.",1183420800,4,1271,4.502183406113537

I met the guys after and they were fantastic to meet,along with Pamela Moore who reprised her roll as Sister Mary. A fantastic voice in Mind crime as well as a solo artist.

For the most part, they did a great job considering they don't have the budget for live shows they had in the early 90's. Mindcrime 2 is not at the level of the first part.
