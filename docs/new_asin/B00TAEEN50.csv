""Stunning, mesmerizing...I was blown away by the complexity of Paysons VideoTonePoems.""

Consciousness expressed through poetry, philosophy, critiquing personal history, rich music and compelling images. As a reality of the mind, the Greeks would have called it beauty of the mind.
Leonard Miller, University of California, Berkeley/Professor Emeritus

Having watched Payson Stevens expanding artistic journey for over 30 years, I am awed by his attempt to integrate its many facets into one new media of expression. The poet, musician, philosopher, scientist, and environmental activist has come full circle in his creative endeavor...bravo!
Nele von Mengershausen, artist, Germany

Utilizing video, poetry, photography, and music, Payson Stevens leads us on a breath-taking expedition into the mind and senses before
landing us squarely back in  our own hearts.

A tour guide to the transcendent, Stevens is a generous host, allowing us to accompany him on an illuminating journey through Indian religious sites steeped in spirituality. You can sense his delight as he introduces to a culture and a land he so obviously loves ... including a visit to his magnificent Himalayan home. His final  meditations on the human condition, the environment, and technology are a wake up call to us all.

A heart-warming, breath-taking, soul-stirring,  adventure! Excellent!!",1430438400,,1454,5.668202764976958
8701136,5,B00TAEEN50,"The marriage of breathtaking nature photography combined with Hindu and other stone religious carvings merges the world of the seen and unseen in a transcendant vision of life and meaning.  Some of the most beautiful and moving video I have ever seen.

8701137,5,B00TAEEN50,"Payson R. Stevens VideoTonePoems are compelling. A blend of exquisite visual art, intriguing sound, and the poignant written word eloquently expresses Mr. Stevens devotion to his art, his spiritual practice, and the world around him. Words of wisdom permeate and enthrall. The videos are short, offering the viewer-reader the opportunity for a quick injection of inspiration when needed.

This artist has found a unique medium of expression. I highly recommend his work and a visit to his website, [...], where his visual art and other works are also displayed.",1428969600,,561,5.303370786516854
8701138,5,B00TAEEN50,"Each of Payson Steven's work is awesome, and this new genre of VideoTonePoems is an innovative juxtaposition of poetry, video and music.  Presented with his voice full of pathos and his philosophical interpretation of the world around us.  Best to be watched with the family, especially the children, one at a time, in dimmed light, without any external disturbance, to quitely absorb the meditative vibrations, and develop deep understanding of how we can harmonise our relationship with the surroundings.",1425686400,,506,5.3924050632911396
