7241168,5,B00YSFZBMA,"To put it bluntly, I was amazed!  Note that I do have cable TV but that I do not subscribe to the titty channels, so that the relatively infrequent nudity and just-below X-rated sex was a delightful surprise, as were the frequent F-bombs that occurred exactly when expected (as they would in a more or less real-life situation, depending on your personal experiences).  My partner was offended by the language (and the sex) so I had to watch this all alone but that didn't mean I enjoyed it any less.

You can get the plot anywhere (Wiki is a good place to start) so I'll not go into that.  What I will HIGHLY recommend is watching each season's BANSHEE ORIGINS set of clips so you can get a heads up on what you're about to see without having to figure it out piecemeal from the episodes themselves.  Note that this is absolutely necessary at the beginning of season four, where a lapse of 18-months has occurred.

The clips were scripted and shot separately from the episodes themselves, as explained by the productors on the commentary audio.  I had originally thought that they were outtakes or sections that were cut for time purposes but that was not the case.  THEY DO EXPLAIN A BUNCH OF STUFF!

I can say that each season opens with a whole new set of problems and a bunch of characters whom the writers were not afraid of killing off just to torment the survivors and shock the audience.

To save time and effort, this same review will be posted for seasons 2 through 4 (the last seaon of the series).",1483833600,2,1510,4.478102189781022

7241177,5,B00YSFZBMA,"Unbelievably good, vastly underrated.
You WILL NOT regret buying the whole series, although you have to wait until October until the final season is available on DVD. I'm 61 years old, and I've never seen action scenes so well done.
The fight between Burton and Nola is the best scene I've ever watched.
You care about these characters a lot as you learn why they are like they are.
RECOMMENDED HIGHLY.
