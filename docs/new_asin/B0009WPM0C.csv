That said, it's not too difficult to follow what's going on. Enjoyable if you're a fan of the Luchadore vs Monsters genre. Pretty good prints too.",1183939200,2,309,5.078431372549019
8068768,5,B0009WPM0C,"These are low budget gems of Silver Age Mexican Cinema. The first film ""El Hijo de Alma Grande"" is one of the best. It is well acted and well written. Unlike many of this genre, this movie has a good back story. Blue Demon at his best. The second film is Mil Mascaras fighting vampires. Mil is one of the only Cinema Masked wrestlers who actually wrote some of his own material and even directed his own Mil Mascaras movie. See ""La Verdad de la Lucha"" if you want to see a really superb Lucha Libre film. ""Los Vampiros de Coyoacan"" is very well shot, considering the tired Vampire theme. The producers experimented with colored lighting and the color compositions of many scenes are right up there with Almodovar and even Late Kurosawa. The third film is standard fare - masked Superheroes in civilian clothes, bad monster makeup, cheesy dialogue, cheesy Horror, too few plot points to care, wrestling scenes too dark to view, and sexy girls. It is an attempt to capitalise on the popularity of an earlier, more successful flick, ""Las Momias de Guanajuato"", which spawned several sequels. Still worth the watch.
This is not Academy-quality acting, but you'll never see Santo kissing Blue Demon on any broke Mountain.",1140739200,10,1216,4.767772511848341
