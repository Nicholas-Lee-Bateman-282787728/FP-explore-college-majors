8564795,5,B0010WDMD4,"I loved this documentary! The main character, Eliahu Gamliel is the epitome of what is good in our world. This man has such wit and profound joy for life and nature that it makes me want to go to Israel and experience a little of what he has.
The film explores the origin of one of Israel's most famous songs, known by kids and adults alike and we get to learn how this simple, yet powerful song came to exist.
It's hard to believe that, when most documentaries deal with some kind of tragedy, scandal or horrible problem, you can find a jewel like The Land of Milk and Honey which only deals with the positive aspects of life and culture.
I got to experience Israel in a completely different light... no war... no terrorism... just good vibes.
Truly recommend for everyone.",1196985600,2,774,4.457746478873239
