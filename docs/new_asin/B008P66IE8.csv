8529398,4,B008P66IE8,"I got my order in record time, even faster than Amazon.com would. No defects on the discs and I enjoyed the series very much. If you have to rely on the English subtitle, you better read the book first. The English subtitled is so bad it's almost shameful.",1455408000,,256,4.354166666666667
8529399,5,B008P66IE8,"Yes, the subtitles are sketchy...but the characterizations and story telling are dead on.  This is not a movie with a gazillion-dollar budget but the production finally does justice to a true classic.  The special effects are TV series quality, which means they work when they have to, the fight scenes are great, but again, this manages to bring out the characters, a feat only accomplished in a few episode-based versions of the story.  If you like The Water Margin, get this and ignore the Engrish subtitles when you have to.",1414195200,,528,4.844444444444444
8529400,3,B008P66IE8,"this is probably a bootleg I got the same one from Malaysia. its very good show but its not the best picture quality and its PAL. the main problem is the English subtitles, for example they talk about going to Tokyo, that's in japan, ive read the bopoks this is strickly Chinese. I feel many words were left out of the subtitles and the translations of the words are horrible. I cant wait until this will 'officially' come out and ill  buy its again. hopefully on blu ray with the real actually translated correctly subtitles.",1374796800,5,526,4.536842105263158
