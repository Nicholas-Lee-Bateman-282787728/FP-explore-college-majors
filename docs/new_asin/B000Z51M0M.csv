8321518,5,B000Z51M0M,"They advertised original, non-black market Bollywood movie. It was just that -- original and non-black market. Anybody who buys Bollywood movies know that the market is oversaturated with black market wares that often times do not work, subtitles are off-sync, and the quality of the discs are just really bad and often warped. So I appreciate that this dealer sells only original and real releases!",1287100800,,399,5.153846153846154
