8295417,4,B001DXUF9Y,"This is an interesting documentary about the Russian Empire.  These vol cover from Peter the Great to Catherine the Great.  The dedication is to the 300th anniversary of St. Petersburg and the 300th anniversary of the Russian Empire, which is certainly an intriguing political argument, as it proposes that the USSR and Putin's Russia are simply continuations of the empire.

There were many things about this documentary that I enjoyed.  First was that it was shot on location.  For example, the house in Holland that Peter the Great stayed at is shown, and the similarity to the house he later built in St. Petersburg is very evident.  Locations throughout Europe and Russia are used.  There's a lot of information, and although I was looking for errors - I'm a professor of Russian history - I didn't catch anything significant.

However, I didn't like the hysterical visual style and found the translation in the subtitles problematic.  At times, things seem to be left out by mistake, but at other times I suspect it was intentional.  An example:

In the Russian original: Even by Russian standards, the steppe people lacked a developed state structure.

English subtitles: The steppe people lacked a developed state structure.

The fourth program (the second part on Catherine the Great) was especially problematic with the subtitles.  The section on Jews was translated in such a way that made it seem rather anti-Semitic, while the original Russian doesn't have that sense.

However, this is an information-packed overview of Russian history that's worth watching.  A hint: go to the 3rd item on the menu (Ustanovlenie, first letter looks like a Y), then choose Angliiskii (English) for the subtitles.",1306713600,2,1709,5.093525179856115

I'm a huge fan of Russian culture and history. At first this set seemed juvenile to me but after watching much of it I can't stop. Perhaps the sound and visual effects could be called distracting but sometimes they are quite humorous as intended. For one who does not speak Russian fluently I find reading the closed captions challenging because the texts sometimes go by very quickly. Then again, when one owns such a set the joy comes in revisiting the same program many times. Always something new and un-noticed in earlier viewing becomes clear.

I very much encourage people who want to learn about the history of the Russian Empire from the time of Peter the Great through the last Tsar to purchase this set.",1250380800,3,790,4.595744680851064
8295419,5,B001DXUF9Y,"I have been renting the Russian Empire series through Netflix and have found this documentary of Russian history done on its 300th Anniversary totally fascinating. I use my atlas to map out all the locales mentioned and am amazed how large Russia is and how in the 1700 and 1800's they travelled long distances by horse/carriage. It is very well done with a mix of movie footage, shots of locations that figured in the history and very cute cartoon-like sections with quotes from the historic figures at the time. Very cleverly done. Nothing like this in American documentaries. It's fun to watch. The commentator who explains the history is very engaging. This is in Russian with English subtitles which are amusing because they are obviously translated by a Russian not fluent in English so at times a little hard to figure out what is being explained. There are Russian titles in the various sections that are not translated, unfortunately. Definitely worth viewing if you are interested in Russian history.",1229212800,8,1010,4.982248520710059
