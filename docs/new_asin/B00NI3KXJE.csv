When I first watched ,and then came summer I gave it a rather bad review, Watching it a second time I have changed my mind. Jeff Has a certain style that takes time to get accustomed to. They are always shot in close one one one interaction or small group. I have come to really like his work.",1532908800,,435,4.253012048192771

8678354,3,B00NI3KXJE,"These movies were quite enjoyable.  They are not as polished as they could be, but still worth watching.  I would really like to see this director continue to evolve as he clearly captures some honesty in his work.",1429401600,,214,4.605263157894737

8678356,2,B00NI3KXJE,"Three of the 4  dvds had no subtitle/CC option, which as a hearing impaired person I really rely on. Consequently the  stories were very hard for me to follow and the audio soundtrack seemed VERY poor overall. While the producer has dealt with some very relevant gay themes, the execution is only fair. Disappointing to me as a whole.",1425772800,,334,4.6440677966101696
8678357,5,B00NI3KXJE,"I received this DVD set from my niece for Christmas.  I am amazed at the depth of the characters in each of the four films. Jeff London is a brilliant writer, able to bring realistic people and emotions we all share to the screen. The settings, casting and shooting are so impressive. These are lives of people we are or know. Real life on screen. Each film is extremely satisfying. You cannot watch these films only once. You will find validation to your own life and a marvellous hope for happiness. One of the best presents I've ever received.",1422230400,3,546,4.515151515151516
