2472340,5,B000CS3AHA,Very good price.  Good delivery.  Enjoyed the show very much.  Gunny has a good thing going.  Hard to believe someone gets paid to have that much fun.,1257897600,2,150,4.444444444444445
2472341,5,B000CS3AHA,This DVD should have been twice as long. One can never have enough R. Lee...,1227484800,4,76,4.133333333333334
2472342,5,B000CS3AHA,"If you like the Mail Call show you will love this ""blooper"" version. The thing about R Lee is he is 100% sincere in his love for the Corps but he's also a born performer and it comes thru in his presentation of the show. What is unexpected is how funny he is and loveable he comes across in all the episodes. Like many of us I revered him in the movie ""Full Metal Jacket"" but you owe it to yourself if your a true fan to check him out in the comedy ""Saving Silverman"". The series Mail Call is one of my very favorite shows and this SNAFU DVD is great!",1209168000,,551,3.9285714285714284

2472344,4,B000CS3AHA,"Not as ""salty"" as advertised.  Some TV shows on Fox network have more ""saltiness.""  Bloopers are funny, but not as funny as I expected.",1199577600,2,135,4.583333333333333
2472345,5,B000CS3AHA,"If you're a fan of Mail Call or it's host R. Lee Ermey, you definitely don't want to miss out on this DVD.  The bloopers are damn funny, and there's a nice collection of special chapters along with it. The only problem I had was the hour went too quick and I was hungry for more.

Thanks for the laugh, Gunny!",1162857600,4,309,4.049180327868853
