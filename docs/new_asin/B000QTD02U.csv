Completely insane and offensive and only for fans of Z-movies, never mind b-movies, they feature alternately disgusting and hilarious  performances by John Giancaspro of a kind that are only available in the independent underground, and which will never be seen in the polished, professional, but too-often DULL world of bigger-budgeted films. Tropes from the mainstream are sprinkled throughout these movies, but here they are mutated into underground nightmare visions, like an angry and drug-addled madman's vision of society's favorite films. But here the constantly ranting serial killer Harry Russo, who tortures and strangles prostitutes before raping their corpses, ends up being closer to the majority of real serial killers that you'll read about than any Hannibal Lector ever could. There is a dirty realism underlying all the craziness and sometimes-poor effects here that is unshakeable, and this and other Ron Atkins films should be given a look by anyone who found this review and it's friendliness to underground cinema intriguing. All others, and anyone easily offended by extreme political incorrectness, are well-advised to stay away!",1459296000,,1325,5.458536585365854

8197280,5,B000QTD02U,"Most people don't understand these movies... I thought they were great! So bad they're good type of nasty fun. Its so awfully and cheaply made, its delightful to see these masterpieces! Gorehounds beware, you won't see Dead Alive or The Burning Moon here, instead its a trip into the bowels of a maniac (Harry Russo, played brilliantly by John Giancaspro) as he snorts and kills everything in his way. Great B-Movie, for fans of trashy, exploitation, sick and depraved cinema. Also one of the darkest comedies ever made, its hilariously no holds barred fun, if you get to appreciate its unique charm.",1410652800,,600,4.892156862745098

I will say it can be very offensive to some people but it was not made to b taken serious. Crazy fun",1364428800,,274,3.6610169491525424
8197282,1,B000QTD02U,"OK, I usually only write reviews on films that I have enjoyed and want to share with fellow Amazon freeks but I must make an exception here!!! I simply cannot let this film sit with one lone review and 4 stars, if I was able to I would rate it with 0 stars! The budget for this film might have exceeded $100, the acting is absolutely horrendous as well. The main character tries way to hard to come across as a lunatic and in turn will annoy the living crap out of the viewer, absolutely ridiculous and not even laughable! The cover of the film states that it is the ""Most vile pieces of filth ever filmed!"" No chance, I cannot emphasize enough how unentertaining this was! The nudity in this film, well trust me they should have kept their clothes on, ugh! The gore, the most unprofessional crap ever put on film, were they even trying? The insanity, the only insanity would have to be purchasing this crap!

Unfortunately I cannot get back the wasted time I spent viewing this film but I can sure enough try and save future viewers from doing the same. Now that I think of it I wonder why my DVD player did not spit this out onto the floor and then vomit on it and then run over and kick me in the b@lls for letting it play for so long!!! Well, wishful thinking any ways!

For those of you who like shocking, gory, controversial and offensive films check out some of my lists here on Amazon but PLEASE don't waste your money or your time on this complete GARBAGE!!!",1277769600,,1467,4.292418772563177
8197283,4,B000QTD02U,"This was not half as bad as I had been led to believe by other reviews i had read.
Yes it's not got the budget of so many other ""nutter"" films, But if you want Cape Fear, er,  watch Cape Fear.
 It does what it says on the tin- You will not have seen anything like this before, I smiled all the way through it.
The guy who plays Russo (our protagonist) is completely barking to the point where he is happy to run round the streets with his willy out in just about every other shot, he shouts everything he says, most of which is unrepeatable here!
 The violence is cheap and unconvincing but because of the sentiment it works,
It's very sexually explicit, mainly women, with close up shots of their bits all over the place! And the main character has a semi-on for most of the time (quite a big lad too!)
It's sick, twisted, depraved, morally void and FABULOUS!
Watch it with your mates, not your bird!
Can't wait for more of the same!",1193616000,4,934,4.235955056179775
