8268132,1,B00180OU7K,"This entire movie was based on a testimony by the husband (to the FBI agent) about his wife's supposedly psychotic murdering of 7 people either because they were immoral, marriage-haters, or just plain jerks (Roberts). I anticipated a surprise ending but this ending was not a surprise (well maybe) but was just plain dumb, completely eradicating everything seen in the previous 80 some odd minutes.  So since the entire movie was a series of  lies, couldn't we have been given some little hint as to what the truth was?",1524700800,,520,4.831460674157303

8268134,2,B00180OU7K,"Another Sin Eater movie. Sinners must be punished to preserve the world for His return. Burn them, kill them etc etc taken straight from the sociopathology handbook. Here's the irony of Dark Honeymoon, it brings up very relevant points about marriage, illustrating how a lot of people get married to people they don't really know realizing their mistake only after it's too late. Getting married for the wrong reasons usually caving to pressure but are too embarrassed to admit they screwed up, resulting in a miserable life trying to ride it out with someone they settled for, hence adultery or kink to avoid judgment while committing adultery. Trying to find some kind of worth by clinging to someone who can ""make them happy"" a definite recipe for failure trying to find someone to provide something the individual should be providing for themselves. Sam summed it up when he asked Nick was it his first time before revealing he was married four times. Real is real, if a person isn't even 30 and has already been married and divorced twice but desperate to get married again, alarm bells are ringing and the red flags are flying high and clear. It's time to be out of that situation. Chronic marriage addicts are the worse.

The film is heavy handed in some respects leading me to believe the director either went through a horrible marriage or witnessed a horrible marriage (who hasn't these days). Divorce lawyers are laughing all the way to the bank either way. Unfortunately this basically sums up the film. Killer wants to kill people so comes up with a anti-marriage, Jesus freak story for justification. Fornication, bi-sexuality, adultery...horrible dirty sinners all, they must die. The End. Except the twist at the end reflects the film. Not really all that interesting for a story that's not really all the interesting to begin with. There are a lot of well know actors and actresses in the film though, Darryl Hannah, Roy Scheider, Eric Roberts, Tia Carrere, Lindy Booth. Why?

One extra star for Tia Carrere because her character is such a pot smoking, bi-sexual slut in this movie but it's awesome. Total fantasy fulfillment, the type that will destroy a marriage faster than you can say ""the condom broke"". Attractive woman comes on to a married man in a cheap motel lobby, she is hands down more attractive than the wife, attractive woman is willing to sleep with both husband and wife because she's awesome like that, husband realizes he's an idiot for throwing away his freedom and should have never married to begin with because he really wants the attractive woman and only kinda sorta wants the wife but not really.

Anyways, with so many well knowns in the film, makes you wonder what inspired them to star in such an obviously suspect film. Pass on this one unless you need something running in the background while doing laundry.",1520553600,,2857,4.838445807770961
8268135,3,B00180OU7K,"I liked fellow reviewer Huhito's analysis of this movie...but there are too many scenes where both the husband and wife are obviously present.  However, the plot has puzzling ""holes"" that are damaging, especially the twist ending.
DARK HONEYMOON did hold my interest.  The film's name stars aren't really used much:  Eric Roberts is the movie's first victim and Darryl Hannah has little screen time.  Roy Scheider as the motel owner and Tia Carrere has a pivotal role as a sexy seductress.  Lindy Booth chews up the scenery as the repressed psycho and boyish Nick Cornish has an affable demeanor as the supportive husband.
DARK HONEYMOON is disposable but enjoyable filmmaking.",1320796800,,677,5.118181818181818
8268136,5,B00180OU7K,"The only way to explain this movie is to spoil it upfront so if you haven't seen it once, see it, then read this, then see it again.

The truth is that he does get too drunk to kill her on their wedding night, esp since we find out later that she is trash from NYC that didn't invite anyone to the wedding.  We find out also that his father is a preacher/fireman(saves lives).  When we find out that his wife is also cruel, that is when Tia shows up.  This is the side of his wife that he was forced to kill.  The righteous side and the deceptive side are both Lindy and Tia talking to him after he makes it to a motel.  There he makes a shrine to marriage but he has lost his mind.  He lost it the night his wife didn't want sex after he had waited so long to have it.  He was the virgin.  And after he gets to the gas station in his dad's BMW, he kills a man because he has already crossed over to being a killer.  The whole time that he is talking to his wife at the motel he is actually talking to his own righteous side, his preacher side, his unyielding side.  Tia is another side of him;  a devil's side, a yielding side, a deception point side.  The two girls and him are all actually the same person.  He killed his wife long ago on his wedding night in her wedding dress.

Anyway, this is a movie that you get 4 friends to spend 6 hrs yakking about what it all means and it probably would make a GREAT campus movie to show to a group of eggheads.  I thought it was great not just because of the fine acting which in retrospect was not so bad if he WAS the killer, but because I had to watch it literally 2 times to get some of it and then skip forward and backward a bunch of times to get everything straight. So I spent more than 7 hours watching this movie and it was fun and not too gross.",1282608000,6,1802,3.922865013774105
8268137,1,B00180OU7K,"This was terrible! Lindy Booth as a psychopathic Christian zealot killing the ""sinners""? No thanks. Also, for them to put Eric Roberts on the DVD box when his scene lasts about a minute before he is killed is extremely deceptive to the person buying the film.",1280707200,6,259,4.6521739130434785
8268138,2,B00180OU7K,"If someone had said to me before I watched this movie ""Trevor, here's a movie.  In this movie, Lindy Booth and Tia Carrere make out.  However, by the end of the movie, you'll wish you hadn't watched it,""  I would have said ""Impossible.  There's no way to screw up a movie that badly.  Those two kissing will make up for ANYTHING.""

I was wrong.  I wish I hadn't watched it.  Despite a steamy kissing scene between two of the hottest women in Hollywood (ok, Tia Carrere's not 25 anymore, but still not bad), I could have rented anything else at Blockbuster and been happier.  Eric Roberts and Roy Scheider deserve much better roles.  Ditto for Daryl Hannah.  Lindy Booth has made some decent stuff, too, just not here.

The storyline is awkward and improbable.  How did Lindy Booth get that woman up into that tree, anyway?  With the rope?  And then she tied her up with it?  I don't think so.  While we're at it, I'm having a hard time seeing her lift Roy Scheider and put him into a car trunk, too.  I suppose that in the end she didn't really do it, he did (spoiler, sorry!), but even that is left poorly explained.  Why did he do it?  What's HIS psycho background?  At least I wasn't expecting it to end like that.  The Sixth Sense, however, it's definitely NOT.

The movie ends with the killer walking away after escaping from a police car wearing an orange prison jumpsuit and a State Trooper hat and jacket.  Yeah, he'll blend right in looking like that.  They'll never see him again.  At least you don't have to.  Unless you really enjoy bad movies.  Then go ahead and see it.  Thanks for reading my review!",1238976000,4,1614,4.412969283276451

8268141,2,B00180OU7K,"This movie just plain stunk! Don't know why I'm surprised. I'm notorious for picking out crappy movies. BUT I thought I was safe with this one because of its ""big"" stars. The acting & dialogue seemed awkward. The married couple didn't have any sort of rapport or attraction. And it just ended up not making a whole helluva lotta sense all-around - which always totally irks me. The only reason I didn't give it only ONE star is because of Roy Scheider & Eric Roberts (although sadly, Eric only had a brief appearance). Don't waste your time or money on this bomb! I'm glad I only rented it, but still....that's $4.50 I'll never get back!  =\",1218412800,4,641,4.525862068965517
