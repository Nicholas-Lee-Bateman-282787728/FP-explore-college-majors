8443608,5,B004VLYHN0,Very good review of the Queen's life and reign.,1452211200,,47,4.333333333333333
8443609,4,B004VLYHN0,"Again, this DVD was given as a gift and I was never informed whether it was good or not.",1448582400,,88,3.6842105263157894
8443610,5,B004VLYHN0,Well what can I say I love Queen Elizabeth she has & is doing her Job very well. I believe she is loved by many close and afar.,1406246400,,127,3.5714285714285716
8443611,5,B004VLYHN0,It is a very good depiction of the Queen's life. I highly recommend  it  to anyone who is interested in royalty.,1391817600,,112,4.285714285714286
8443612,5,B004VLYHN0,"Over the last 20 years or so, I have become a great admirer of the queen of England.  Even though I am an American, I have the utmost respect and admiration for a woman who dedicated her life to the royal service how ever long or short it may when she was only 18 years old.  Many of the people who have been interviewed on some of the DVD's I have about the Queen have said that she is the glue that holds the country together.  This DVD helped me to understand hermore as a person and not just the Queen.",1371427200,2,506,3.99009900990099
8443613,5,B004VLYHN0,"As a monarchist, I'm always interested in books about royalty and although there's always the temptation to think that it would be nice to be part of such a fairy-tale world, the reality is really quite different and more like hard work than days of fun.",1371081600,,254,4.543478260869565
8443614,5,B004VLYHN0,"Even if you're not a monarchist or a fan of Britain's royal family you should watch this just in order to see what duty and self-sacrifice really means. When she was 16 she made a tremendous discovery: for whatever reason a visit from the monarch MEANS something to people, it's something they'll remember for the rest of their lives, so YOU MUST NEVER LET PEOPLE DOWN! Her beloved father, George VI, taught her that, and she has lived by it ever since.",1360454400,2,453,4.536585365853658
8443615,1,B004VLYHN0,"This dvd was not worth what I paid for it. There's little information that isn't already known by most. You would do much better by buying a good biography of HM Elizabeth II. The whole thing seemed cheap, from the quality of the video footage and audio to the over-used news footage that everyone has seen 100 times.",1328745600,5,317,4.482758620689655
