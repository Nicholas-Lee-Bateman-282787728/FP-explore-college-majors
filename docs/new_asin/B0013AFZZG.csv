8249599,4,B0013AFZZG,"I plan to go to Alaska next year so I purchased this.  There is a lot of good information contained on this DVD but these guys could show a little more excitement about fishing!  If you are planning a trip to Alaska you should get this just for the info it contains.  One thing I was surprise with is that it does not have any info on fishing the Keni Peninsula.  Having said all of that and knowing I want to fish the Keni, I would still buy it.",1355529600,,446,3.9775280898876404
8249600,4,B0013AFZZG,"The dvd is a little dry, but they are very precise in giving directions on the exact locations where they are fishing for King Salmon in southcentral Alaska.  I actually fished a couple of these spots, and caught my first Kings!  I love any dvd that focuses on Alaska, plus you get to see some nice scenery.  At $30, this is a bit overpriced in my opinion; in hindsight, I would've paid upto $20 for it.",1323216000,2,403,4.276315789473684
8249601,5,B0013AFZZG,"Even though we live in Alaska, I bought this video in order to be able to explore some new fishing ground without having to go out and waste a lot of time doing so.  There's just to many places in this state to fish for salmon, and if you spend your time exploring and come up dry you'll miss out catching fish at spots that are sure things.  I can personally attest to the kind of success you can have at Honolulu Creek, but now I have a lot of other options close by thanks to Jim and Russ doing our scouting for us.  Their information is right on and I highly recommend this video, and no doubt their others, for anyone coming to Alaska to enjoy the fantastic fishing we have to offer.",1203724800,4,688,4.119402985074627
8249602,5,B0013AFZZG,"As with your other videos, this was a great watch. Can't wait to try out the locations suggested. This will help speed things up. Had a blast on the Aniak thanks to that video and book, look foward to a repeat expirience. Keep these coming.",1203465600,2,240,4.355555555555555
