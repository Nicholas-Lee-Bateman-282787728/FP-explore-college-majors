4141912,5,B003L77GTM,"After the rather low key Seasons 4 and 5 (great in their own right, but vastly different from Seasons 1, 2 and 3), Weeds seemed like it was heading for it's end. In all honesty, where could this series possibly go? Well, the answer awaits in the immensely rewarding 6th Season.

After the shocking events in the 5th Season's finale, Nancy and the gang (minus Celia, which is a blessing since the show didn't need her anymore), are off on the road. Sending the characters on the run was a risky but inspired move because it exhausts them dramatically, puts them in contact with some wacky people and locations (adding much of the humor missing from Season 5), adds a real sense of urgency and danger and keeps the pace brisk and engaging.

What works best about sending Nancy and Co on the lam is that it also lets the show backtrack it's history, letting the characters come to terms with what they have done over the years. It's in that self reflective nature that the show brings in a wholly unexpected emotional level. The finale here is not necessarily shocking in terms of plot, but shocking for what Nancy does emotionally, when you see it, you will never think she had it in her. Season Six of Weeds is decidedly different in almost every aspect, but it also brings all of the shows past seasons into a greater light.

Since we finally get to really see what is going on under the surface with Nancy, Andy, Silas, Shane and yes, even Doug, we begin to understand their past (before the show started), their actions during the series and then how they react during Season Six. With the writing in such top form, the acting is even better. Mary-Louise Parker is as riveting and unlikeable as ever as Nancy Botwin (though the frustration you feel with her during the season is specifically calculated and snaps into focus during the finale). Justin Kirk really takes the front seat as a father figure and leader, being the emotional ground for which the family stands. Hunter Parrish as Silas gives a haunting, aching performance showing how he is really questioning his role in the family and what he truly wants in life. Alexander Gould as Shane is as dark as can be, but we also get to see beyond that facade and into the soul of a tortured young boy. Kevin Nealon as Doug is not exactly needed but adds some nice comedic touches and the send off (for now at least) of his character is rather poignant. Season Six also has a fantastic array of guest stars including Linda Hamilton, Mark-Paul Gosselaar, a very memorable and funny Richard Dreyfuss and a slew of returning cast members from previous seasons (how these past characters are integrated into the story is very clever).

If you are a long time fan of the series, Season Six of Weeds will be vastly rewarding and emotional for you, it's a complex, decidedly different, and introspective season that rewards in spades. A great show that just keeps getting better.

4141913,4,B003L77GTM,"The show doesnt have the realistic feel it used to have, but its still fun to watch.  Andy(Justin Kirk) is amazing in this series, if it weren't for him and Kevin Nealon I wouldnt watch.  Those two should have their own show!!!  But anyway, if your looking for some good laughs and an escape from your day to day life then pop in this season of weeds, or any season for that matter and enjoy.",1289952000,2,392,4.2
4141914,3,B003L77GTM,"I'm torn over this season of ""Weeds."" Season 5 had an amazing cliffhanger, and this season definitely has its moments, but it just wasn't as good as years prior. Nancy, Andy, Silas, and Shane take the baby and run after Shane's, ahem, incident by the pool. The Botwins assume new identities and scrape by working odd jobs and selling hash as they traipse around the country, hiding from Esteban and his cronies. Although there are some truly hilarious moments, many of which include special guest star Richard Dreyfuss as Nancy's former lover/high school math teacher, I really, REALLY missed having Elizabeth Perkins (Celia) on the show this season. Also, the final few episodes were kind of out there. The whole Silas/Lars thing came out of nowhere, and the final few moments of the finale threw me for a loop and were not near as good as the last few finales have been. Still, I'll stay loyal to ""Weeds"" and look forward to seeing what next season will bring.",1289865600,31,962,4.732142857142857
4141915,5,B003L77GTM,"okay, i know a lot of people are saying weeds started to go downhill after third season, but i still love it! I mean sure the first couple of seasons were better, but which show isn't like that? I love weeds and will continue to watch the show!",1288569600,7,244,4.104166666666667
4141916,5,B003L77GTM,"I don't care what anybody says, this was an awesome season. Not as good as previous ones, but I'm still eager to watch and find out what happens. Very disappointed that Celia is gone because she was one of my favorite characters, but Doug is back and that's pretty awesome.",1288396800,8,273,4.48
4141917,2,B003L77GTM,"Not much left to this show except to see Mary Louise Parker naked I guess - maybe they can move the show to Cinemax.....This show really needs Elizabeth Perkins back, badly.",1287100800,11,173,4.612903225806452
4141918,1,B003L77GTM,"Lets get this out of the way. That fine looking Cougar in the green dress and that brigade of bad boys makes for an awesome front cover, but heck that's all this show has to offer at this point. It really was ok when it started but it went from being dramedy (drama with comedic themes) to just a boring series. This this should be the last season or maybe they should end it next season. I give this 1.5 stars, I wish you could rate something on this site 2.50, 3.50 and so on.",1286409600,9,478,4.042105263157895

They would have offed her immediately.  Why are they still calling it ""Weeds"" since it's not about weed anymore?  Hated the ending episodes for the sixth season.",1473292800,,443,4.4625

No such luck.  Now I'm into the final season, and liking her better again - seems like she's growing up a bit.

Favorite character is Celia Hodes, and I'm hoping she'll be back during the last season at some point.  Started out loving the brother-in-law Andy, but now I'd like him to be killed off too for being so annoying.  Do NOT want to see him and MLP finally get together, but I suspect they will because they deserve one another.

I didn't think it was possible to make the lead character anymore repulsive, but they did! She is just beyond awful, and the rest of the cast is now pretty awful as well..so no real incentive to watch anymore. The only thing that would have kept me watching this series would have been seeing Nancy killed or imprisoned for life along with at least one of her sons. I had sympathy for the older son and the brother in law, but not enough to keep watching.",1362787200,,546,4.20952380952381

4143000,5,B003L77GTM,"Season Six of Weeds was a really enjoyable surprise. It is an entirely different season, as it is driven by increasing more suspenseful plot lines, several of which are very good, clever and quite successful.

The series really moves away from its ""mom sells pot"" genesis and becomes a bit of a ""buddy / road"" movie. Which is OK, its just different.

Where it really shines is the performances of Andy, Silas and Shane. They all have much more to work with. Andy, as always, is given the best dialogue. Shane and Silas really develop a rapport and have some important plot contributions. The Nancy character is fine, but becomes (in our opinion) ever more detestable! Hey, its not bad acting, just a bad character in the middle of an entertaining situation. Doug is along for the ride and several previous Weeds characters make cameo appearances.

Other reviewers mention ""poor writing"" but I think they are missing the point, or don't know what they are talking about. The writing is just fine, sometimes really great. The difference is the plotting, which is a huge change from the great Seasons 1 and 2.

In many ways its an entirely different show with familiar characters.",1350604800,,1177,4.783251231527093

4143069,4,B003L77GTM,"This is the worst Season to date compared to the previous five.  Although I enjoyed watching it simply to see what's going to happen next, it lacked the humor and wit the previous seasons had.  It's never been as great as it was the first three seasons, but you still get hooked on following this family around.  They're on the run from the drug lords and the FBI in this one.  Using fake identities to get by and drive all over America in a camper.  It was ridiculous and lame.  There were sections that seemed way too outlandish to be realistic.  It seemed as if the writer's got lazy and were doing paint by numbers sitcom work.  Let's just spit this out quick and go home.  Who cares if it doesn't make sense and can never actually happen.  I still give this 4 stars simply because I've followed this family this long it feels like I know them, but I expected something fantastic at this point.  If this were the first season, it'd probably get one star and I wouldn't watch any other seasons after that.",1341878400,,1008,4.365591397849462

4143167,5,B003L77GTM,"I, have watched all of the ""Weeds"" seasons, up to 7. I would recommend this show to any open minded adult who enjoys to watch a funny show, kind of about weed. Also, that has a pretty good story throughout the seasons. Some people may not like the show because it is called weeds, so obviously, it is going to be a little, or maybe a lot about weed among other things. Honestly, the first season probably was my least favorite, because I think it was i bit too soapy for my taste. it should still be watched, for sure. If the first season doesn't hook you or you don't like it, then I believe you should at least give the second, and or third season a chance to change your mind. I honestly think it will. I think throughout the seasons this show has been funny as hell and a little informative. The only reason I say a little, is because i already know about a lot of stuff done in this show. which is probably another reason i love this show. I do recommend buying this season or all.  This was my review on this show, I hope it helps.\

4143447,4,B003L77GTM,"my husband and I watched Seasons 1 through 5 over Spring Break last year and were completely addicted. We waited and waited for Season Six to come out on Netflix to no avail. Season 7 began on Showtime but Six was nowhere to be found. For less than the cost of another month's waiting for Netflix I just bought season six.

If you're addicted to the show, you'll watch it and enjoy it even though it's clearly the weakest season. Spoiler alert: they just spend the entire season driving around. One episode is entirely spent at a Montana State Fair. Nothing happens that really contributes to the plot as a whole until the last two episodes. Everything else is an amusing little Botwin Anecdote.

Not the best, but I'm a TV Junkie so I'll take it. I've definitely spent $16 on worse things. Hell, we've all lost $16 in our lives so at a bit more than a buck per episode watching the Botwins drift across the country is worth it.",1318204800,,928,4.421052631578948

I think at this point selling Nancy as a sex object is pretty ridiculous.  Basically this whole season is the family on the run from Nancy's Mexican husband.  They get in several very stupid situations.  Nancy thinks she can use her sexuality to get her out of every situation, it just doesn't work any more at this point to me.  The only thing exciting is the last episode when her husband catches up to her, you want to find out what happens next.  That is about it.  Save your money !!",1312243200,,834,4.379084967320262

I started watching this show a couple years back, and I really liked it.  I have watched season 1-6 so far, and overall, I find the show to be pretty good.

Season Six:
I really liked the first 4 or 5 seasons, but somewhere in there something changed for the worst.  I really felt that this sixth season was the worst they have created so far, and I have actually decided to quit watching the show entirely.  If I was rating the show from season 1 to 5, I would easily give it 5 stars because of how good the first few season were, but I would definitely quit watching after season 5.",1308441600,2,603,4.172413793103448
4143584,4,B003L77GTM,"I recently purchased the entire ""Weeds"" series currently available. I had seen it all in some capacity on Showtime, but in light of news about Season 7, I had to give it one long, season-to-season rewatch. Season 6 felt a little uneven plot-wise(creator Jenji Kohan all but admits this in an interview about the finale) but thanks to the well-crafted characters the show has amassed, you can pretty much watch the Botwins and Doug Wilson do anything.

The season was definitely one of taking stock in where the characters were after their crazy Mexican mishaps. Nancy's descent into the most selfish person ever continues to entertain. Andy, after falling out with his fianc, is still earnest in having a meaningful life, and it of course can't happen with Nancy. Shane, the killer, gleefully takes on a faux-hardcore protector role, believing his headshot to be the beginning of a brand new him. In what is probably the most shockingly entertaining of them all, however, is Silas' growth and desire to break away from the insanity. I honestly couldn't stand the Botwin children during the Agrestic years, but burning the city down really grounded the two of them more than I would have expected. I walked away hoping Silas will get the normal, complacent life he longs for. Doug has lost everything, and is really only clinging to the Botwins as they're all that's truly left.

A notable missing link in this season is Celia Hodes, played by Elizabeth Perkins. She was a great character, and it seemed like they were setting up a real arc for her, but Kohan states it just wouldn't have been organic for her to follow Nancy across the country. I, dishearteningly, agree. As fun as Celia was, she didn't have anything to do in the fourth and fifth seasons, so the writers just tortured her.

The Botwins go on a road trip this year running away from Nancy's kingpin husband, Esteban Reyes. I really got the feeling what hurt this season was new writers. They're obviously being guided by Kohan and producers Roberto Benabib and Matt Salsberg, but the jokes dialed back their punches and the drama is more spelled out to us. Benabib says it himself in commentary on the sole episode he co-writes with Salsberg; they're digging for storylines. Little hints at a larger plot tie themselves together towards the end of the season, and they do an alright enough job at letting us know Nancy is not without her remorse, and you might find yourself confused at how you can still sympathize with her. Alas, we seem to be gearing up towards the end. I would say the only season this manages outrank is the first one.",1308355200,2,2607,4.737885462555066

There are more twists and turns and surprises for each character and Nancy and co have never been more up in the air!!!
This season everything is turned upside down and its a gripping on the edge of the seat affair .
Jenji  has given us so much to wonder about this time and wherever  she takes us we constantly be surprised and enthralled. This show has excellent writing ,a fantastic first rate cast ensemble to rival that of Grey's Anatomy,Dexter, Saving Grace and all the other first rate outside the box shows America has given us. You have to get it and  embrace the mayhem , the laughs , the drama and the touching family that are driven by a mom trying to raise her family by any means necessary ,the only way she knows how!

4143671,4,B003L77GTM,"Personally, I like this season over the previous two. I prefer the focus to be on the Botwins, and both Silas and Shane's storylines were vastly improved. The ""on the road"" arc really brought the series back to it's core appeal.

Some of the lesser episodes in Season Six do veer a little into sitcom territory...with pretty broad humor. But, as always, even those moments are anchored by the talented cast.

Loved seeing Richard Dreyfuss guest star...but would have liked to have seen a few more moments between just him and Nancy. That storyline seemed to call for that. Regardless, Dreyfuss delivers (of course) in the moments that he has...and there's solid support from quality character actors throughout the season.

To me, the series hit it's nadir in Season Five... so it's nice to see some fun infused back into show. Now...bring on Season Seven!!",1304985600,2,857,4.896551724137931

She spends the whole show foisting her baby onto her other children/brother in law - and drinking iced coffee.  Just as the show seems it might pick up, they're on the run again.  No real humor.

4143806,2,B003L77GTM,"Let me start by saying that I used to loooove this show, that is before the writers of season 6 completely destroyed it with dreadful writing, abrupt character introductions/exits, and poorly developed storylines! This season was all over the place, never really took off, and lacked a solid plot driven storyline. As a matter of fact, the best episode of the season was the last, an episode in which I nearly missed due to the hollow, vacuous, and mindless nature of the rest. I mean seriously, being on the run and taking an unexpected road trip should have been easy for the writers to work with. They could have introduced the reporter storyline earlier and developed it throughout the season (would have been entertaining seeing Nancy/Natalie manipulate that situation to her advantage)or worked in Celia's character instead of Doug's; Doug's character is annoying at best, and Celia...well Celia's character has always been entertaining, nonetheless. Perhaps they could have, in some complete twist of Weeds like fate, come across Heylia James and/or Conrad. That would have been interesting and I can only imagine how that would have played out. Oh, and then the whole thing with Silas and Judah??? Seriously, give me a break. Keeping the above in mind, while considering the weakness of the previous TWO seasons(4&5), I can't believe this show hasn't been pulled yet. It's truly sad to see such a great show like Weeds go down in flames simply due to indigent, lazy, and idle minded writing. I'll still watch season 7, but only because I'm certain it will be its last.

The writing is absolutely pathetic this season.  Season 6 has Nancy & the Family on the run and, boy, do they run.  They never stop.  Anytime the season starts to get even remotely interesting, like when they get hotel jobs in Seattle, boom, they're gone and on the run again.  There's weird random graphic sex scenes with characters who have nothing to do with the story and which leads nowhere.  In fact the whole season is pointless and really leads nowhere.  No great new characters introduced.  No fun juicy dramatic new stories to really get into.  Just the family on the run being chased by drug dealers and the FBI.  Really???

4143897,3,B003L77GTM,"The title perfect summarizes this season.
Everything I have grown to love from Weeds has either been toned down, missing in action all-together or beaten to a pulp where it became tasteless.

For instance, charismatic characters that steal the scene with hilarious lines--that dorky Indian guy, Sanjay, his ghetto stereotype girlfriend, U-turn,  Isabelle, supporting characters like Celia, Conrad, and characters that really forced Nancy to adapt or do something ""unthinkable."" Can't remember all of the names, but if you watch previous seasons, you know that most of the f-ed up s! Nancy did, it was because she was/people left her out of options.
Also, the clich TV-show cliff hangers, that I love to hate, are almost inconsequential. The dramatic moments are just as anemic, and don't even amount to much.
The jokes are so spread out it feels like when they'd try to be funny they'd make fun of religion, but it became so tacky, it simply felt like it was written by an atheist or agnostic liberal Hollywood extreme leftist who was molested by a religious bigot.

Silas was the only character that showed believable growth, and I don't know if the actor did a great a job, or if he was simply bored with the series, but I feel and empathized with his uneasiness.
Nancy, or Nathalie just became a capricious b! She lost her conscience, what gives us doubt, remorse, and a sense of morality. It felt like she was enjoying herself too much. And that counts for her actions toward people--her family, supporting characters, and even herself; and simply the random decisions that she'd make.
The whole season felt dumb, from the clueless cops, to the ""moments of clarity,"" and the ""twists and turns."" And I fell asleep at least three times, during my four sessions.

I don't recommend buy the episodes. Just wait for Netflix, rent, or simply pass. You wouldn't be missing much. I hope this won't be going downhill, I have hopes. The last episode is a great set-up for new waves of charismatic characters, or for simply Nancy to continue her glorious destructive road to oblivion while using and wrecking as many people and lives as possible.",1301702400,5,2139,4.852054794520548

Shane has just killed Pilar and Nancy does what comes naturally to her, and runs.

The best thing about this season is that the family (and Doug) comes to terms with there actions over the last five years.

Shane is a little scary and untill like the 7th episode he is portrayed as a evil, but misguided child. Nancy has always dragged her family through the mud, but she makes up for it in this season when she hands herself in.

Silas is the one character however that i followed the most, he was never the character i liked the most in previous seasons but he is the innocent soul trapped in a prison. I was gutted that he didn't have he's happy ending, but at least we get him back fro the next season.

The first 5/6 episodes were fantastic, the series dipped a little towards the middle but teh finale was amazing.

4143964,4,B003L77GTM,"For better or worse, Showtime's hit series, ""Weeds,"" has certainly changed over the years. As each episode twists and turns, the Botwin clan (led by the indispensable Mary Louise Parker) -- as well as the show -- somehow manages to adapt and evolve in ways that are truer to real life than the average drama, despite the extreme situations they often find themselves in. At this point, you really have to love and identify with the core characters to really enjoy the show. Sure, they may not be living in little boxes selling little baggies, but you can sure bet there is enough juice left in this dramatic-comedy to leave you drooling for the next season by the time this one wraps up in typical cliffhanger fashion.

True to form, season six of the show finds the family in yet another setting; this time the Botwins are on the run thanks to some misbehavior by the budding psychopath Shane (Alexander Gould) at the end of season five. With the engagement of Uncle Andy (Justin Kirk) dissolving, he decides to tag along, as per usual. Together they flee from Nancy's husband (Demin Bichir) and commence upon a road-trip that takes them through Seattle to the Midwest, where the family business turns to selling hash and the Botwins actually (gasp!) get jobs. One particularly amusing detour finds the clan blending in with a commune of fellow fugitives while Nancy gets a Zack Attack from Mark-Paul Gosselar and Andy seems to have found his blessed calling. The season wraps up with the family unearthing some major secrets in Michigan while reconnecting with an old friend (Richard Dreyfuss) and ultimately devising a plan to flee the country altogether for what a quaint paradise that seems inevitably out of reach.

Like seasons before, season six of ""Weeds"" is almost as addicting as the drugs its characters peddle. It'd be so easy to knock out all 13 episodes in one-sitting, and you can chalk that up to good writing and phenomenal performances by the cast. Although certain characters are left behind (most notably Celia Hodes, as portrayed by Elizabeth Perkins), the core group more than compensates. Parker is excellent as always playing the sometimes selfish and sometimes oblivious mother than you can't help but feel sorry for. Although most of the narrative is driven by the actions of Shane, it is big-brother Silas (Hunter Parrish) who is finally given a bit more depth and the show feels the stronger for it. Kevin Nealon returns as Doug, a wholly useless character in the scheme of things, but it's great to have him along for the ride and Nealon delivers solid chuckles throughout, as always. Other noteable appearances come from the likes of Linda Hamilton, Peter Stormare and Patrick Fischler.

Season six of ""Weeds"" is best appreciated with the knowledge that you can never go back. Agrestic was left for dead three seasons ago, and hoping for a return to form will only lead to disappointment. Rest assured, these 13 episodes will keep you on your toes while simultaneously beefing up some of the principal characters (yes, even Doug). If creator Jenji Kohan is to be believed and season seven truly is the last, then you can bet it'll go out with a bang and that many of the detractors of these last few seasons will miss it when it's gone.",1299456000,3,3267,4.799289520426288

4144027,5,B003L77GTM,"**NOTE - This review contains minor spoilers **

After three seasons in Agrestic, and two seasons spent in Mexico, Nancy Botwin and her brood pull up roots once again as Season 6 becomes one big road trip for the family, now on the lam because of Shane's murderous tendencies, which became apparent in the Season 5 finale.

When their attempt to cross the border to Canada is foiled, the gang first settles in Seattle, shacking up in a cheap motel after having gained employment at a nearby hotel by crossing a picket line and replacing striking hospitality workers. Nancy isn't scrubbing toilets for long until she finds a way to start dealing to the hotel guests in search of weed. Linda Hamilton makes an amusing appearance as a no-nonsense lesbian dealer, and nails the delivery of every line she has.

Andy, Doug and Silus practice trailer-park evangelism when the gang has a stop-over in Montana. Dale Dickey makes a small but terrific appearance as does Mark-Paul Gosselaar (he has a bare-buns scene having hate-sex with Nancy).

Celia disappears this season, and as much as I love Elizabeth Perkins, the plots and guest characters make up for her absence--I didn't miss her near as much as I thought I would.

The cliffhanger season-finale is something this series has almost always done to perfection (save for the burning of Agrestic in Season 3--it just wasn't gripping or suspenseful enough for me) and Season 6 does not disappoint.

Like the cover art says ""Weeds is still smokin'"" and I whole-heartedly agree. Everything that made me fall in love with this series is still here: the jet-black humour, addictive and quirky storylines, and solid performances from the entire cast.

Losing some of the secondary characters was a mistake because it forced us to stick with the Botwins who have, in many ways, become caricatures of themselves.  Shane is primarily a one-note psychopath; Nancy, a certifiable whack-job and most definitely the creepiest, most dysfunctional mother in the history of TV (Peggy Bundy is Donna Reed in comparison); and Andy, who occasionally has a moment or two to shine, needs to grow a pair and get on with his life--this constant mooning over a woman as ridiculous as Nancy is kinda pathetic.  The only character who really grew was Silas.  I was hoping he'd run screaming from the family and get the college dream he wanted.  The show's finale, I must admit, was a great surprise and although it was way over the top, gave me hope that the upcoming season might actually go somewhere different and regain its strength.

Weeds first started out simply, pot-dealing soccer mom Nancy Botwin tries to make ends meet by introducing the herb in her suburb. However, as Nancy finds her way crawling up the drug-world grapevine, danger and comedy are ensured.

This season was one of the 'lesser' seasons, it did lack focus and seemed like a real road trip at times. The season begins to pick up once Nancy returns to her hometown, ready to flee the country to escape the Mexican Mafia, FBI and her husband who wants her head on a pike, Esteban (Demain Bichir), and his betrayed henchman, Guillermo (Guillermo Diaz).

From Seattle to Colorado and Michigan, we follow the Botwin's on an escape, living off the lam since Shane (Alexander Gould) bludgeoned Mexican VIP and queenpin, Pilar Zuazo (Kate Del Castillo) after she makes her intentions clear in season five's shocking finale.

I like to grade the series by episode for a full analysis of the season.

Episode 1: Thwack!

Fleeing Ren Mar during the aftermath proves to be difficult for Nancy & co. Andy cuts it off with Audra (special guest star Alanis Morissette) and Nancy and her family begin their life on the run. (B+)

Episode 2: Felling and Swamping

The Botwin's assume new identities and head north to hide from Esteban, now on hot pursuit of them. (B+)

Episode 3: A Yippity Sippity

Starting over in Seattle proves hard for the Botwin's as they try to manage their double lives. Silas (Hunter Parish), Nancy (Mary Louise Parker) and Andy (Justin Kirk) get jobs at a Space Needle hotel. Oh, and Shane steals a baby stroller for Stevie/Ahvi! (A-)

Episode 4: Bliss

Nancy gets back into dealing and makes two new friends, a pot-growing lesbian couple (guest starring Linda Hamilton and Sugar). Low on money, she gets a new idea, bubble hash. Nancy's mind just never stops. (A)

Episode 5: Boomerang

One of the best episodes of the series. It had a multi-flustercluck involving Latrice, a hotel maid who finds out Nancy's secret, and Shane gets some blowback from confining in housewives with no lives. Which you should never trust anyway. Seriously. (A+)

Episode 6: A Shoe for a Shoe

A somewhat disappointing conclusion to Shane being kidnapped by Cesar, but overall a strong episode. Ties everything up and feels kind of like a mid-season finale. (B+)

Episode 7: Pinwheels and Whirligigs

A rather plain, and in my opinion the worst episode of the series. Fluffy and light, it lacked the darkness that has been lingering around the Botwin's. Oh, and Doug (Kevin Nealon) officially is freed and with the Botwins. (C)

Episode 8: Gentle Puppies

Forging new identities, the Botwin's become the newest born-again's in Pioneer City 2010. Nancy makes a new friend, and ends up letting her sex drive ruin the Botwin's plans. (B)

Episode 9: To Moscow, and Quickly

Problems with Stevie make Nancy more self-conscious about her questionable decisions and parenting styles. Andy proposes they leave the country... and the plot begins to thicken. The FBI remains to keep an eye out for Nancy. (B+)

Episode 10: Dearborn-Again

Nancy reunites with her eccentric pedophile math teacher who has obsessed about her since she was 15, Mr. Shiff (Richard Dreyfuss) and Shane and Silas start to dig into how Nancy was as a kid. (B+)

Episode 11: Viking Pride

Silas comes to a revelation after learning Judah (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) might not be his real father. Andy creates a new drug, and the search for passports begins (A)

Episode 12: Fran Tarkenton

The crap starts to hit the fan for Nancy, as she no longer has anywhere to run. The whole family is ready to leave the country... but not without Nancy. (A)

Episode 13: Theoretical Love is Not Dead

In this twisty season finale, Nancy makes a decision to finally bring everything full circle. Gin Wigmore's ""Hey Ho"" plays in an unforgettable montage. Excellent finale. (A+)

Season 6 had some strong episodes, but overall lacked a focus. I like how they came full-circle with the final 4 episodes. Season 7 will begin in Summer of 2011.

Also, I couldn't help but miss Celia (Elizabeth Perkins) and her family (Allie Grant & Andy Midler) after they built her up last season to rival with Nancy.

This had to be the worst season of the series and showcased just how horrible of a mother Nancy is.
Up through the fist few episodes of season 5, the show enjoyed a pretty good run and was fun to watch; Celia made it even more so and when they got rid of her it was like the wind was knocked out of the show.

Spoiler:

In an interview with TV Guide, weeds creator Jenji Kohan apparently stated that season 7 may be the last and that Nancy may die. I didn't see the interview (it's posted on the Wikipedia page) so I don't know if it's true or not.

After a terribly stale and soap-opera-esque fifth season, Jenji Kohan and the team of writers behind this brilliant dark comedy have kicked the show back into gear. The sixth season finds the Botwin family ducking and dodging their way down a dark and twisted road. With the Botwins evading the Mexican mafia and the FBI, the sixth season is injected with a renewed shot of adrenaline, allowing for the return of the trademark Nancy-looking-like-a-deer-in-the-headlights cliffhangers that have been missing since the third season.

4144131,5,B003L77GTM,"Weeds has certainly changed alot over the years. It started out with poor widow Nancy Botwin secretly dealing dime bags to her suburban neighbors, and then she started carrying on with a DEA agent, who she marries. She then begins to grow marijuana, and starts to sell her own strain. She's held at gunpoint, her DEA husband is murdered, and she begins to pay a debt to a drug dealer named U-Turn, who eventually dies. Her neighborhood of Agrestic (a high-class suburban neighborhood that she has pretty much dominated over the years) burns down in a wildfire which she inadvertently, sorta-kinda caused. She then moves with her family down to Ren-Mar where she begins trafficking drugs for the Mexican mafia. She falls in love with Esteban Reyes, a mayor of Tijuana. She discovers that her cover business is being used for human trafficking, so she squeals to the DEA, and the tunnel is shut down. People find out that she squealed, so she is almost killed, and then BAM - she's pregnant with Esteban's baby. So, she has the baby, gets married to him, and begins to settle down into her new life. Soon, she discovers that there's a woman named Pilar Zuazo who is Esteban's boss, who wants Nancy out of the picture. Tension between them ensues for quite some time, and then in the finale, Nancy's 13-year-old son Shane kills Pilar, knocking her in the head with a croquet mallet, leaving her to fall into a swimming pool, and bleed from the head, to death.

So, here we are, season six. Nancy and the family are on the lam again, and they stay on the lam through out the whole season, while Esteban and his crew are on their tail through out practically the whole thing. Like every season of Weeds, this one has a few slow-burning episodes in the middle of the season, that leads to an eventual spectacular finale, that makes you excited to see where it will go from here. Throughout the season, Nancy and her family settle in Seattle, each of them working minimum wage in a hotel. They then go to Nancy's hometown of Dearborn, Michigan. They impersonate religious fundamentalists, Nancy hooks up with the guy who played Zack Morris on Saved by the Bell, Silas has his long-overdue college experience, and the family makes some big plans.

One thing that I love about this season is that every character is brought into some kind of illumination. Each character realizes how crazy the things they've done over the years are, and what kind of person they become because of their actions. Especially Nancy, who has seriously tricked fate over the years, she (finally) takes responsibility for her actions, and realizes what kind of person her actions have made her. And, we (the audience) realizes that she has always been a wild card, making decisions that are risky and possibly self-destructive. I won't elaborate more, other than saying that the season ends with a selfless act that makes Nancy a much more likable character in the long run.

One thing that I really didn't like about this season, is that Elizabeth Perkins' character Celia isn't around anymore, when Kevin Nealon's Doug is still on the show, for what reason, I don't know. While Celia's story was getting lame over the years, they gave her a great cliffhanger in season five, which will probably never be resolved. And, at certain points in the season, the direction feels kind of aimless, like they don't know where to go with what they have. However, that proves to be untrue, as the season progresses.

4144132,3,B003L77GTM,"The first two episodes of this season really almost did me in as a fan. It was so obvious that the show didn't know where to go. This is something that has cropped up here and there , in all of the earlier seasons , except perhaps the first. A good example would be the sudden, unlikely death of U-Turn. In fact, in my opinion, the writing on this show has ALWAYS been a little on the uneven side. The most popular three solutions to problems as they come bearing down on Nancy....the DEA, Nancy f's someone or someone dies...or sometimes all three, as in the case of Peter.

I stuck with it this particular season and at times I thought "" cool , they're back, this is going to be great"".  Unfortuneatly, it never really delivered anything solid or even very memorable other than maybe the conclusion.

I thought the show was very stale towards the end of the 5th season , again , other than the finale. Going on the run gave the show a real chance to settle, well , anywhere , really. My imagination soared at the concept of the clan somewhere a little different, such as Canada or Seattle. A chance to recapture some of that magic of the first two seasons without the repetitive, overbearing seriousness of her ascent through the higher ranks. Face it, Nancy was at her best when she was still a small fish.

I couldn't help but feel that the writers did not have an end game for the 6th season and didn't really expect a 7th season. It seemed everytime they ran out of quick laugh type scenarios...they moved them down the road. Finally, another option other than death, the DEA and/or sex...just move on. I really wonder if this is an option we may need to consider as fans, in order to preserve the memory of a once overwhelmingly fantastic, unique and innovative show.
