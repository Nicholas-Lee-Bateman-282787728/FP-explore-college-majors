Transfers are ""best available source"" and quality can vary from very good to only fair.

I'M FROM ARKANSAS features another silent movie vet, the underfed and over-height Slim Summerville. Also here is Al St. John. An early association wth Mack Sennett may have helped bring St. John's uncle, Fatty Arbuckle to Sennett's Keystone Cops (Summerville was also a member of this bunch). In the sound era, St. John was western film sidekick to many stars, both 'A' and 'B' grade.

In this countrified musical programmer from Poverty Row's PRC studio, a silly prize-winning hog story is mere backdrop for some great C&W swing and yodeling songs. Interesting to see Arthur Q. Bryan, who's best known as Elmer Fudd, try (and fail) to hide any Fudd-like inflections as he portrays a dignified Secretary of Agriculture.

7036214,3,B00UCKF512,"This is a nice musical comedy if you're into older films and country-western music from the old days.  Overall, that's not my brand of music, but I'm a big Mary Ford fan, and seeing a young Mary Ford along with numerous other well known musicians of the time is worth the price of admission alone.  Nice, quaint storyline with colorful characters.  The acting isn't always top notch, but I don't think that was the main focus or point of the movie.  I think it was supposed to give the viewer a taste of a country hoedown in a rural setting with musical acts interspersed between dialog.  It was simply meant to entertain, not to make the viewer overwhelmed by award-winning acting or special effects.  It succeeds, as it is entertaining, as long as you know what you're getting.  Some jokes are tongue-in-cheek parodies of the country bumpkin, while others are not.  Don't expect Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn type performances, but do expect a look into yesteryear's entertainment by old-time country performers.",1357862400,,1017,4.872093023255814

8705412,3,B00UCKF512,"This cheapy hillbilly flick from PRC Studios is a hoot.  I can't really give it four stars because it just does not compare with a truly four-star movie.  Nevertheless, this one is fun to watch if you have low expectations.  Future cowboy star Jimmy Wakely sings several songs.  As others have mentioned, Mary Ford of ""Les Paul and Mary Ford"" fame is one of the Sunshine Girls (the blond one) who sing with Wakely.  The Pied Pipers do a number at the end of the movie.  Look closely and you will see a young Merle Travis in a non-speaking role, playing accordian in the hillbilly band.  The music is pretty good if you like the older 1940s style of country music.

Some of the comedy is so lowbrow it's funny.  Love the hillbilly brothers, for instance.

One bit of trivia here:  The man who plays the raspy-voiced representative from the Department of Agriculture is Arthur Q. Bryant.  He was the voice of Elmer Fudd in those great Warner Brothers cartoons.  Just thought you'd like to know.  I watched this on Youtube.",1497398400,,1020,4.56353591160221
