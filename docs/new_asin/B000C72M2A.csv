8096173,3,B000C72M2A,"This video is really good for those with some exposure to erotic dancing. In my opinion, its intended audience might be ladies who've danced in the past and just want a quick refresher??  I have a really hard time recommending this one for beginners because the level of instruction goes from beginning moves to more advanced ones very quickly and the moves presented definitely require a certain level of fitness and flexibility that some women might not have and might find too frustrating.

This video starts out by going over different types of walking or traveling.  Then, there's brief instruction on ""slow moves"" using a pole.  The slow moves are not directly taught, but one is expected to pick up on how to move sensuously from watching Fawnia move and her commentary on the moves.  Next, there's floor work, but again, the moves are intermediate/advanced moves and are more gymnastic than sensuous.  The last part of the video deals with stretching and flexibility which might have fit best in the beginning of the video.

On the plus side, Fawnia has a great personality and loads of energy.  She makes an excellent teacher, but again, I think the ""audience"" of the video is women who've had some dance exposure and who are very flexible.  To me, the advanced moves would have fit best in a 2nd or 3rd video. At any rate, the real downfall of this one is that it just tries to fit too much stuff into one video (floor work really requires its own video)and tries to appeal to all levels. I also didn't like the fact that not enough emphasis was placed on learning routines that would incorporate all or at least some of the moves presented. That being said, my advice is if you're not in shape, very flexible or new to erotic dance---save this one for later and start with ""The Art of Sensual Dance"" or ""The Art of Exotic Dancing"".",1132617600,,1842,4.625766871165644
8096174,1,B000C72M2A,"For all of her credentials and titles that she's won, I was expecting more!  It looks like it was filmed in the back of a store for one thing, and she doesn't teach you anything!  She shows a few routines, which someone with no dance experience whatsoever could have come up with.  I watched it once and threw it away!  This was a sad display of dance.  Art of Exotic Dancing for Everyday Women and S Factor Videos - much better!",1132531200,6,429,4.246913580246914
8096175,3,B000C72M2A,"The instructions are clear and understandable, she repeats over and over so you can easily follow and get it down. Then she takes the same move she's just demonstratd and shows you how you can easily incorporate them into the other moves she teaches on this video.

She very clear and takes you step by step (especially in the floor moves) while explaining the type of interaction you'll have w/the customer - I can only assume a real stipper would find this dvd invaluable.

Otherwise, not much else. For 10 bucks I'd buy it; for the $40 bucks it sells for, I wasted my money altogether.",1100908800,2,588,4.537735849056604
8096176,5,B000C72M2A,"Fawnia did an excellent job in this video! I watched, practiced and aced all of the Dance Moves. She shows you LOTS of good Dance Moves that are not commonly used in the States. So, this video gave me a great advantage. Fawnia teaches you how to loosen up and use your body effectively. A Must See!",984096000,,298,4.245614035087719
