8199677,1,B000R9SJYI,"A fine D movie with no plot and bad acting. Trying to make out what is going on in this movie is like listening to two crazy people talking to each other and each one of them is talking about something different than the other. The plot is a mess. The good, well the picture is fine as is the sound, but that's not saying much for the money you put out for this movie.",1415059200,,368,3.92
8199678,3,B000R9SJYI,"After reading the producer's webpage for the movie, I have to say it would have been nice if he had incorporated some of the backstory found there into the film.  It would have gone a loooong way in clarifying some of the events here.  On the other hand, given that he had a budget of $8000 and nine days to film...it was certainly better than your average high school production.

I quite liked that the person in jeopardy was a fully clothed male and not a scantily clad female in high heels.  It was nice to see an average joe in trouble--hey, that could be any one of us up on the screen.  And, whether by design or by accident, the fact that the average joe's average apartment looked like a place almost any one of us has had to live in at one time or another. (Yeah, the key word here is average)  A lot of the movie took place in broad daylight, which you don't see too often.

Another plus was the effort made to transplant and translate antiquarian British ghost story motifs into the 21st century American heartland.  MJ.R. James might have grinned a bit to see some of his tropes woven into the story.

That being said...there isn't a whole lot of story and what there is requires the characters to act like idiots to move the plot forward.  Mr. Klein keeps looking over his collection of newspaper clippings but doesn't get around to telling Jim to GET OUT.  Once Jim and his friend realize that there ARE no new neighbors, he goes right back into his haunted apartment.  As another reviewer mentioned,the police officer is pretty dense about what's going on and if he is Mt. Prospect's ""finest"", Mt. Prospect has even bigger troubles than Amon Moloch.  People who live in that apartment keep disappearing and NO ONE NOTICES?  Again, this would have been a great place to add in the information found on the webpage.  Have the main characters work together to research this place that has been there for centuries and which no one is willing to talk about.  But...nooooo....they just go on acting like idiots.

My other issue is that I couldn't tell if the actors were wooden or if they were struggling with some of the clunkiest dialogue ever written.  It's difficult to write expository dialogue anyway, but when your characters keep telling each other ""and this is the strangest thing"" and go on to add something that isn't particularly strange while ignoring the fact that they previously delivered a whole cartload of information that was even stranger--it's annoying.  Another scene has Mr. Klein delivering lots of creepy noninformation and then suddenly switching gears and getting very chipper.  The delivery of all this non information made my ears bleed.

And, as has been pointed out, the ending seems to come from left field and leaves you wondering exactly what the point was.  The scene is certainly creepy and I wouldn't want to be where Jim is...but exactly what did it all have to do with Amon Moloch and his evil?  Was Mr. Klein possessed?  Does Amon need possess the dead so he can feed on the living?  What was his deal?

All that said, I was sufficiently creeped out that I had to sleep with several lights on, so Christensen is on the right track as far as I am concerned.  If he can polish his craft, write smooth dialogue that sounds like real people talking and learn to handle exposition without stuffing it in in big chunks with both hands...I think there may be a chance we will be hearing good things about his sophomore effort.  I'll watch it anyway, during the day, with all the lights on.

I have to go...something is going bump in the kitchen.",1303603200,,3590,4.58307210031348
8199679,5,B000R9SJYI,"If you're disgusted by the typical brainless blood-and-guts gorefest featuring dumb teens & a stereotypical serial killer, THIS is the movie for you!  In fact, I've been waiting for a movie like ""With You"" for a long time, & my friends all feel the same.  The suspense keeps you on the edge of your seat & slowly builds toward the final - & unexpected - scene!  VERY SCARY!The story itself is appealing with a small-town setting, old ghost stories, & a main character anyone can relate to.  It was fun to watch

It's amazing what was obviously accomplished on a small budget, & would like to see more from this team!",1274832000,2,616,4.513513513513513
8199680,1,B000R9SJYI,"The scary thing about the movie was that it was made. The writing was awful, the lighting, bad, and the acting of low quality. The script could not possibly have been less creative, nor devoid of anything approaching intrigue. The old man who rented the house out was the only actor in the movie i could say did his job, and he was on screen for all of 3 minutes. I love a good low budget film, and enjoy a nice slasher, but this wasn't even a B movie, it was an F.",1245024000,,465,4.010752688172043
8199681,4,B000R9SJYI,"Let me start by saying that to me, the mark of a good scary movie is that it initially scares you, but days later, you can't get images or scenes from the movie out of your head.. and this movie did just that.  We watched this film in our ""girlfriends movie night"".  There were 7 of us ranging in age from 13 to 60 and we all enjoyed this film.  Why only the 4 stars?  Because I'm disappointed that the acting was so B grade.  Many indi films are outshining big budget films in every way, but this film was actually hindered by the acting.  The scenes with the caretaker and the shop owner were actually comical and detracted from the building suspense of the movie.  We even giggled out loud several times during their scenes.  Beyond that though, the music was appropriate and helped to set the tone for the scarier scenes in the movie.  One reviewer here on amazon said that the movie was not scary at all.  I find that comment difficult to understand because it is a classically scary film.  There are no vampire renegades, or chainsaw slashers... maybe that's what today's viewers are looking for in a scary film.  For me, give me a good creaking door, a haunted old house, and disembodied voices every time.  The ending was shocking and unexpected and really brought the whole story together.  It also helped clarify the reason for the title phrase ""with you"". Overall, this is a worthy piece to add to a collection if your a fan of this genre.  The movie is good enough to survive the sub-standard acting, and a welcome find if you are always in search of a classic bump-in-the-dark kind of film, as I am.",1197676800,,1612,4.4353741496598635
8199682,1,B000R9SJYI,"I received this movie in damaged condition so I returned it for a refund.  HOWEVER, I saw it at a friends house and it was AWFUL.  Of course, it's homemade quality, terrible lighting, and shaky camera work.  You can barely hear the actors but the sound effects are loud.  The movie was stupid, the plot, was foolish, and the fright factor was non exisitent.  The movie had a couple spiders, shadowy figures, a drop of a telephone book, and a tipped over bottle for action/scare.  WOW!  This movie was painfully dumb.  Don't waste your time and ESPECIALLY do not waste your money.",1194652800,9,579,4.607843137254902
8199683,4,B000R9SJYI,"I am not one who is fond of horror flicks, but I watched and appreciated 'With You.'  It had me on the edge of my seat, and watching behind closed hands at different times of the thriller.",1191369600,4,188,4.081081081081081
8199684,5,B000R9SJYI,"This is a truely scary movie. Not a bloody, slasher type film. This one builds suspense, and drama to an ending that I did not see coming. Very satisfying as a horror film . This is one to rent or buy. I have watched it several times and will watch it again.",1190073600,2,258,3.980769230769231
