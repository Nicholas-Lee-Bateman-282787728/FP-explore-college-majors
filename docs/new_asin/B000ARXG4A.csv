8079261,5,B000ARXG4A,"Well what a surprise this movie was. I really expected some kind of throw away film but what I got was a rather thought provoking and stylish film. You can't compare this to ""Less than Zero"" 2 entirely different movies so once you have separated the 2, you will like this intricate story of the spoiled rich kid and his delinquent friends. Charlie played by devon Gummersall is the rich kid, with his alcoholic girlfriend, his stoned friend and the girl the stoned friend just recently picked up. this is a 4 person movie and each character is played wonderfully and even Charlie has some depth to him. Give this one a try. It really was very good. the young cast is very good too. Arly Jover, Leslie Bibb and Eion Bailey as the surrounding characters, bravo.",1444608000,,759,4.547445255474453
8079262,1,B000ARXG4A,"I read somewhere how this movie is compared to Less than Zero - definitely no comparison.  Less than Zero really delved into the lives of young adults, drug addiction and personal struggles in a very genuine and creatively wonderful way.  Young Unknowns is very predictable with terrible acting.  It is like watching young people clearly making stupid choices for the sake of making stupid choices - no substance to any of the characters.  Charlie and his friend, ""act black"", use drugs, disrespect women and are just extremely unlikable and stupid characters.  You don't see anything beneath the surface on these character have no redeeming qualities.  You dislike them from the beginning and really end up hoping they get what they deserve in the end.  Not sure why this movie was made - one of the worst movies I've seen in MANY years.  PLEASE do not compare it to Less than Zero - that movie was a great 80's classic.",1360540800,2,921,4.748427672955975
8079263,5,B000ARXG4A,"This movie earned it's stars - for storyline, acting, and cinematography. This independant film is bound for cultdom.  Charlie, the main character, is a kind of spoilt, fast-talking, Beverly hills kid bullshitter, which made me think ""gimme a break"" in the first few minutes of the movie, but as his more somber, alcoholic (and attractive) girlfriend comes into the picture, trying to figure out how much of his [...] she can take, you begin to feel it's not going to be superficial after all.  And it isn't!  The movie never preaches, it's got a hard edge, and it's not a ""Hollywood film"", though we surely learn something by the end of the movie (the hard way, of course).  This film moves at a very quick and engaging pace, the acting is dead on, and it packs a wallop in the end!  The fast-talking, realistic dialogue between these jaded characters and the very recognizable elements within both them and the story, will [...] you in from the get-go and take you on a wild, and horrific, ride!  It creeps up on you..  Look out!",1193097600,3,1031,4.601092896174864
