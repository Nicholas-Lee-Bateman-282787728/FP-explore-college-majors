3702645,4,B001MYIPVE,"Scooby-doo and the samuri sword is a combination of futuristic technology and olden day legends. Scooby-doo and the gang travel to Japan for Daphane's martial arts competition. But it suddenly turns into a wild mystery, with alot of laughs, thanks to Shaggy, Scooby and the rest of the gang, plus others.",1242950400,5,304,4.980392156862745
3702646,5,B001MYIPVE,"In the beginning they are in Japan and they are visiting one of Daphne's friends, who is at a school for martial arts.  At the school they learn that there is an ancient legend about a black samurai.  This is one of my favourite new Scooby-doo movies, it has a wonderful ending.  Anyone who watches it won't want to fast forward through any of it.",1242086400,,347,4.3076923076923075
3702647,3,B001MYIPVE,"I am 21 years old who still enjoys watching the Scooby Doo movies and the show. I thought that this is a good movie but I also noitced while watching it that it is very simular, like another reviewer pointed out, to the movie ""Scooby Doo and the witches ghost"" Even though I think it was a good movie, I still think that it isn't half as good as ""Chill out Scooby Doo"" I enjoyed watching it, but ""Chill Out Scooby Doo"" is much better.",1241308800,,434,4.117647058823529
3702648,3,B001MYIPVE,"This Scooby film is an alright addition to the movie series, but it just didn't really have the same enjoyable feel as previous films. When you first see the gang in the movie the scene appears awkward due to the 3D backgrounds complimented with normal cartoon characters standing in front of them causing a white outline of the characters for a few minutes.

After the beginning of the movie the gang go on a search for the sword of doom. The search and mystery are short due to the film then taking a similar (but much extended) ending to that of a previous Scooby-Doo film. Then Scooby and Shaggy train to become samurai so they can defeat the monster in a small sword fight. I wouldn't recomend this movie unless you don't really mind repeating plots, different animation techniques, or straight to the point conversations with little amusing side conversations as seen in What's New Scooby Doo.",1239753600,4,899,4.726114649681529

3702660,4,B001MYIPVE,"Released in 2009, SCOOBY-DOO! AND THE SAMURAI SWORD is thirteenth in the feature length Scooby-Doo cartoon series created specifically for the home market.

In SWORD, the gang goes to Japan, where Daphne, a noted martial arts student (who knew?), is scheduled to compete in a tournament.  Unfortunately, the gang is scarcely on the scene when the legendary Black Samurai disrupts the competition and steals the Destiny Scroll, which gives a clue to the location of Sword of Fatethe possession of which will return this evil spirit to full force.  At the urging of Miss Mirimoto, owner of the scroll, the gang is soon on the trail with Miss Mirimotos assistant Miyumi and cultural history expert Mr. Takagawa.

Sword drags a bit in the middle, so I wouldnt describe it as among the best in the series, but it has a lot going for it just the same.  The art design is pretty nifty and the plot and its solution faked me out.  The movie riffs on ""hop and chop"" movies, and SWORD also contains supernatural elements that are usually missing in Scooby-Doo outings, and that adds to the fun too.

No one would accuse the Scooby Doo cartoons of being great art, they are usually well done and entertaining. It is always fun to revisit the gang, the plots make fun of their own clichs, and the animation is usually pretty sharp. All of that is true of SCOOBY-DOO! AND THE  SAMURAI SWORD, so everyone will have a pretty good time.  It is also notable as Casey Kasem's final voicing of Shaggy.

People always complain about the re-boots never meeting their expectations and how the classics are better but I'm just glad Scooby Doo gets the opportunity to resurface throughout the years and not fade away into history.

3702687,4,B001MYIPVE,"Although set in Japan, this one is clearly inspired by the same kind of pulp adventure you'd find in an old Edgar Rice Burroughs story, or for more younger audiences, the Indiana Jones movies. Japan's culture is sort of mish-mashed here with chinese elements. The main villain is reminiscent of Fu Manchu while managing to avoiding the stereotype. It gets really pulpy when they gang goes to find this ancient temple hidden in a jungle which is guarded by a cannibal tribe (played for laughs, nothing scary for children). No they didn't leave Japan to get there either. The natives in that scene are straight out of the Amazon, and the temple is a merger of Mayan, Inca, and Aztec culture. I almost expected them to run into Nazis and dinosaurs (They don't its still a kids movie)! It is a strange anachronism, but clearly someone had a great love for the old adventure serials and decided to put Scooby Doo and the gang into them.
