8215547,5,B00005N8B0,Both of these movies are by far some of Adam Sandlar's best movies ever. The Wedding Singer is about a struggling singer trying to get noticed but falls in love with his partner in teaching singing lessons (Drew Barrymore) who is marrying the wrong guy. With the help of his friend and his crushes roommate he must try to win her back before it's too late. Little Nicky is a hillarious story about the son of the devil (Sandlar) trying to save his father after his two brothers escaped from hell and froze the portal. Before his fater deteriorates Nicky must capture his brothers in a flask and bring them back. Both will make the perfect gift for any occasion.,1054252800,,661,4.516666666666667
8215548,5,B00005N8B0,"Adam Sandler has to be one of the greatest comedians of our time. Coming from HBO standup comedy to being one of the most sought after comedians, reflects greatly upon himself. This edition contains great hits, including Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, and Bulletproof, which also stars Rob Schneider in two of the three. Another comedian who is up an coming in the comic business. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a long night filled with laughter!",994896000,,459,4.897435897435898
