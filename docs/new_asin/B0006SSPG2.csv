2193923,4,B0006SSPG2,This movie was very enjoyable. The actors portrayed a realistic yet humorous attribute to the trails and tribulations of man and women relationships. An excellent addition to my DVD collection.,1172534400,4,193,5.466666666666667

2193927,1,B0006SSPG2,"What a mess.

I was so vexed when i watched this film.

The talented black actors in this should feel shame to even be connected to this flim. Just a massive waste of they're time and talent and mine own time for watching this mess of a film.

A massive let down for the black movie making industry full stop.",1137024000,13,309,4.116666666666666
2193928,1,B0006SSPG2,"I was very disappointed in this movie.. I expected so much given the number of actual ""black stars"" appearing in it..  I'm pretty upset that I purchased it ...  It was not good ...  I won't quit following my black stars especially the one's in this movie. However whoever wrote this needs to study script writing and work very very hard.. This movie receives two rotten tomatoes.. sorry people",1136851200,11,393,4.666666666666667
2193929,1,B0006SSPG2,Man this movie set black cinema back 20yrs I couldn't believe it! The cast was good but the storylines typical and one horrible! Well when it comes to love stories we've seen it all heard it all! So I don't expect a new twist on love but the second story with Lisa Raye and Arie Spears worst i've ever seen in my life! Not because I haven't seen worse movies but because who was in it expected more! Don't buy this movie or rent it I wasted $4 on it at blockbuster don't make the same mistake!,1136160000,11,493,4.092783505154639
