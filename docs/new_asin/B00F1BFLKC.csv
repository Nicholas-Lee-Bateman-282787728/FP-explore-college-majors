5962864,5,B00F1BFLKC,"Like many Americans over the age of 55, I distinctly remember where I was when I heard the news (on TV) that John F. Kennedy was shot and killed on 11/22/63. In recent years, as memories fade, there has been less coverage in the newspapers and on TV on that day each year. But this year is the 50th anniversary and there will be much more coverage of the event. This PBS special will air on TV and then released as this DVD. The DVD release will allow more people to see it and allow it to become part of school libraries, just like the recently released PBS documentary The March , that I reviewed earlier this week on Amazon.  The DVD is also an extended version  though I don't know what was added. It is narrated by George Clooney and is part of a series titled  inexplicably  Secrets of the Dead !

The title of the 93-minute documentary comes from the fact that it was 1pm in the afternoon on 11/22/63 in Dallas, TX when President Kennedy was pronounced dead by the White House. (Texas is, of course on Central Standard Time.

This is NOT a story of Lee Harvey Oswald or Jack Ruby. In fact Oswald is only mentioned once and Ruby is never acknowledged. This is about the event and how it was reported to the world by television, particularly CBS Anchorman Walter Cronkite. As we learn, there were parallels between JFK and WC. Both were 46 years old at the time of the event.  Cronkite had just convinced CBS to extend the evening news from 15 to 30 minutes and was the first person to ever be called an Anchorman.

Using incredible color archival footage from many sources, the film lays out both Cronkites and JFKs careers up to that fateful day. And they interview nearly every living person who was involved in the TV coverage. Dan Rather and Marvin Kalb were at CBS, Robert McNeill was at NBC (the end credits list CBS and NBC archives but ABC is not mentioned). We hear from those who were young at the time: President Bill Clinton and current NBC anchor Brian Williams.

If there is one thing that annoyed me in this presentation, it was use of recreated scenes. There was lots of real footage of what was happening in the CBS newsroom  and CBS had made a documentary about a day in the life of Walter Cronkite, which is used successfully. But the recreations, just seemed artificial to me (well, they were artificial). And a new song composed and sung by Michael Feinstein about Cronkite and his sign-off slogan Thats the way it is over the final credits is  at best  in my opinion, corny.  But thats not a reason not to give this DVD a well-deserved five stars.
There are no bonus features on the DVD.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8611401,2,B00F1BFLKC,"5 minutes of insights, 20 minutes of rehash, and the remainder unabashed hyperbole. In one breath Clooney extols the universal love of Americans for Kennedy, and 3 minutes later Dan Rather (accurately) points out that JFK's razor thin win in 1960 required a political trip to Texas in anticipation of a 1964 re-election bid that was no sure bet. More narration about Dallas welcoming Kennedy with open arms, while the accompanying visuals include a grim faced man holding a Confederate flag. One of the talking heads makes the absurd claim that this was the single biggest news story of the 20th century (Pearl Harbor, anyone?). Almost everything in this program has been said and done better elsewhere. A truly sub par episode of a decent series.",1415318400,,747,4.936507936507937
8611402,2,B00F1BFLKC,"I found the documentary quite interesting, but was surprised at two blatant falsehoods which continue to be mentioned in retrospectives of that day. the first is Dan Rather's claim that he and KRLD's Eddie Barker spoke on the phone while Barker was at the Trade Mart and Rather was at the station. Rather claims, as he did in his 1977 autobiography, that Barker told him that Kennedy was dead based on what he heard from a Parkland doctor who was at the luncheon. This is impossible and Barker has said so a hundred times in both print and on the air. Barker said he never spoke to anyone on the phone because from 12:40 until 1:35 CST, he was on the air describing what was happening at the Trade Mart. He never had thirty seconds to chat with anyone and aside from that, Barker claims there was no telephone near him from which he could speak with anyone. Rather is simply wrong about this and the videotape of the KRLD broadcast proves it beyond any doubt. The second mistake was the assertion that Robert Pierpoint of CBS told Walter Cronkite during a phone conversation not to announce the president's death until it was official. Even Robert McNeil, who was then with NBC, says he was with Pierpoint when the conversation took place and heard him say, ""Don't make the announcement yet!"" Well whoever Pierpoint was talking to in New York, it was not Cronkite. From 12:50 through 1:50 CST, Cronkite was on the air live and did not stop talking. The videotape of the broadcast proves this once again. Also, in the scores of interviews Cronkite has given about that day over the years, he never once mentions any phone conversation with Pierpoint or anyone else because it simply didn't happen. Cronkite did not use the phone until after he was relieved by Charles Collingwood and left the studio. Finally, the camera that they showed in the recreation of events was NOT like the camera in the CBS newsroom that day. The camera that was in fact used had a single zoom lens (as obvious in the broadcast) and NOT the three lens turret system that was used on older cameras. On the actual videotape of the day, you can see the camera zooming in often, both on Cronkite's face and on photos that he was holding up. Interesting, but not entirely accurate.",1392076800,3,2252,4.590570719602978
8611403,4,B00F1BFLKC,"Overall this is an interesting documentary. Like many others I have grown tired of hearing only from conspiracy theorists about what happened on 11/22/63  and I now prefer to hear about it from people who were actually there on that day and can tell us what it was really like, from their perspective.  One PM Central Standard delivers pretty well on that point as we hear from some of the news reporters who were involved in breaking the story to the nation, and it tells the story in a compelling way.

The main story is told from the perspective of the CBS newsroom in New York where staffers who are spending a routine afternoon preparing for that evening's newscast are suddenly confronted with incredibly terse and incredibly apocalyptic news flashes coming over the teletype machine.  You feel caught up with them in the controlled chaos,  adrenaline is mixed with cool professionalism as they take these snippets of earthshaking information and turn them into televised news bulletins. And we watch the amazingly restrained and measured reporting of Walter Cronkite as he works this live situation.  I have seen the coverage that all three networks did on that day and they all did a remarkable job, but of course Cronkite is the iconic figure that most people remember so it is natural that the story revolves around the CBS coverage.

A few other perspectives are told, like the story of the UPI reporters in Dallas who generated those initial terse, frantic teletype bulletins.  And we also hear from Robert MacNeil who was in Dallas that day as a reporter for NBC news.

However at several points during the documentary we are taken out of the story and suddenly subjected to several minutes of extensive fawning over Walter Cronkite, as the narrator (George Clooney) and others gush endlessly in obvious reverence about Cronkite's influence on television journalism. Obviously Cronkite was one of the focal points of the story, and I would certainly expect to hear some of the commentators give praise for how he handled himself during that chaotic first hour.  But it went beyond that at times into almost a tribute to Cronkite as if he were the subject of the documentary.  They even bring on former president Bill Clinton to gush about Cronkite.  What does Clinton have to do with the Kennedy assassination? Okay he was himself president at one time, and as a young man he got to meet JFK at the White House.  But why are we pulled away from the gripping story that we are watching and forced to listen to Bill Clinton gush about Walter Cronkite?  Very odd and very distracting.

Also it seems like this subject matter was worthy of a standalone documentary, instead of PBS throwing it into their oddly titled ""Secrets of the Dead"" series.  When I saw this written in weird calligraphy on the cover of the DVD (lower right-hand corner) I almost passed on this DVD thinking it was just another nutty conspiracy sideshow (maybe this time it was zombies that killed Kennedy).  I am glad that I took a closer look and picked it up.  Weird calligraphy and weird fawning over Cronkite aside it's a good documentary.",1390608000,4,3125,4.798507462686567
