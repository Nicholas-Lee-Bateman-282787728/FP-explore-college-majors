8326896,3,B001NGGBDK,"I've seen nearly every single episode of the show, but only have a few on dvd in a collection. I'm so hooked I want the entire series, but there's no collection like this being offered in the US. We love Poirot over here too, you know! Come on, let's get a complete set offered in the USA!",1403827200,2,289,4.087719298245614
8326897,4,B001NGGBDK,"For those of you looking to purchase the ENTIRE series of Poirot, starring David Suchet, be advised that this collection does not include ANY program beyond ""Apppointment With Death.""  Therefore, it does not include: ""Three Act Tragedy,""  ""Hallowe'en Party,"" ""Murder on the Orient Express.,"" ""The Clocks,"" ""Elephants Can Remember,"" ""The Big Four,"" ""Dead Man's Folly,"" ""The Labours of Hercules,"" or ""Curtain,"" the final episode in the series.

The series is excellent.  It's one of those gems I keep returning to in my DVD collection.  Especially when i cannot stomach one more cable rerun.

I would give it 5 stars, except for the fact that the ""complete collection"" is incomplete (not including series 12 and 13).",1402963200,,714,5.165217391304348

8326900,4,B001NGGBDK,"This is so much better than the US version but you do need a region free dvd player. I have a Pioneer Elite which upconverts to 1080i.
David Suchet is an incredible actor anyway, but his performance as Poirot is faultless. I am a Brit resident in the US and if you can get the region (PAL) 2 dvd and the right player it is so much better than the NTSC version.",1371427200,5,360,4.013888888888889
8326901,5,B001NGGBDK,"This is one of thee best products,Agatha Christie is and was the best book writers,Poirot is one,Bring all of his movies,and Suchet?he is the best.its a must have.",1370736000,,163,4.857142857142857
8326902,5,B001NGGBDK,"I purchase this set about  years ago, I believe . I love it. Quality is great, the only one thing I missing is a subtitles in English. Would be great if next collection will have them.
 Otherwise, great collection to have.:)",1332979200,10,224,4.439024390243903
