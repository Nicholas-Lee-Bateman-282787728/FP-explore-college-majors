8441558,5,B0002DVBMQ,"I bought these DVDs for my nephews two years ago and they loved them.  My son, who is now 2, has been in love with these DVDs since he was 18 months.  We will be lucky if he doesn't wear the DVD out.  This is the PERFECT child introduction to basketball.  If your child is like mine and enjoys sports, he/she will love this DVD.  Our son has learned so much, specifically with this DVD he is picking up teamwork and the basics of taking a shot at the hoop.  I now give one of these DVD in the Tiny Tots Sports series to every child we go to a party for.  We have received 100% positive feedback from the parents about how much thier child loves it and where could they get more.  The best part has been watching my son shoot at the basket we have and run for those rebounds.  He actually began telling us what he is doing.  He is picking up the basics about the sport while learning how to have fun!  Thank you Tiny Tots.. you give my husband and I a good 30 minutes of fun and education for our son every day!  I can't wait for spring so he can get outside and play again!  Coach Coati Rocks (he is the series mascot)!",1199664000,,1119,4.009049773755656
8441559,1,B0002DVBMQ,And the entire series sucks! I bought this and golf and it was a waste of money and time. It was poorly put together. Watch your home videos instead or the NBA with your kids if you want to have them SEE the sport. Or take them out to play instead.,1144627200,,248,3.8823529411764706
8441560,5,B0002DVBMQ,"My toddlers can not get enough of this video and the entire series by Tiny Tot Sports.  It is a fun educational experience without being instructional.  As a coach I recognize the need for toddlers to explore on their own and not be instructed on their attempts to shoot, pass, and dribble. They will learn from watching other toddlers dribble and shoot sometimes successfully and sometimes unsuccessfully.  Again, as a coach this video gets 5 star vote!!",1138665600,,455,4.883116883116883
8441561,5,B0002DVBMQ,"My children absolutely love this new series of videos by Tiny Tot Sports.  Baby Basketball takes the cake as their best title to date.  We look forward to baby football.  These videos are balls, shapes, colors, and stimulating characters that the children adore.  They loved the mascot Coati.  My two year old goes crazy when he comes on the screen.",1090886400,,349,4.75
