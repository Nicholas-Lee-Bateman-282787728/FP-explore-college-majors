7907812,5,B00000F9SC,This tape is excellent.  You not only find clips of The Honeymooners on this tape but clips of Jackie Gleason's other characters as well.  This well worth the money for Honeymooners and Gleason fans alike.,1187136000,,205,4.828571428571428
7907813,5,B00000F9SC,"This is an excellent video documentary.  It shows many wonderful clips and skits from ""The Honeymooners,"" but the highlight for me is seeing the clips of Gleason's other characters:  Rudy the Repairman, Reggie Van Gleason, Joe the Bartender, Charlie Bratton (The Loudmouth), and others.  These characters are not available in syndication or elsewhere, so being able to see these characters is a real treat.  Plus all of these clips help to explain and show just what a genius Jackie Gleason really was.  I recommend this video for all Gleason and ""Honeymooners"" fans, as well as anyone interested in comedy history.",991267200,17,615,5.11
7907814,5,B00000F9SC,"This video is a must for every Gleason fan's library!  Tremendous footage of all of Jackie's characters, including Kramden, Reggie Van Gleason III, The Poor Soul, Rudy the Repairman, Joe the Bartender, Fenwick Babbitt,  Loudmouth Charlie Bratton, and others.  Nicely done.  Can't wait for more  to be made available!",942883200,20,316,5.36734693877551
