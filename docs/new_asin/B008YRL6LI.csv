5191378,5,B008YRL6LI,"This Canadian television show about a supernatural world (the Fae) that exists in secrecy among humans is so different from the typical fantasy TV show that it grabbed my attention immediately. It incorporates mythologies and cultural folklores; however, they are the ""Lost Girl"" version of myths and legends. It has characters, action, and escapades that are enthralling and entertaining. The creator and producers have described the series as a supernatural crime drama with light comedy and it definitely lives up to their description.

The protagonist of Lost Girl is Bo (Anna Silk), a bisexual succubus that was adopted and raised by human parents. A succubus is a creature that must feed on the ""chi"" (the life force) of humans and Fae to survive; and when injured absorbs the chi and energy created during sexual encounters to heal. Being the modern version of the mythical succubus, Bo feeding or healing from either a male or female is irrelevant because it's all sexual healing to her. Bo accidentally killed her high school boyfriend by draining his chi during her first sexual encounter and it was after this incident that her parents told her she had been adopted. Thereafter, Bo fled from home and everything she had known, living a friendless existence, accumulating a history of chi-drained bodies; moving from city to city and creating a new identity each time.

Bo saves a human woman, Kenzi (Ksenia Solo), from a rapist by draining his chi and when she realizes what Bo did for her, the two become instant friends (with Kenzi as Bo's streets-smart sidekick). This kill brings the heretofore unknown Bo to the attention of the local Fae clans. The Fae are powerful supernatural beings that have existed in secrecy among humans since the beginning of civilization, despising and using them for their own benefit. Their world is divided into two clans, the Light and Dark, with the Dark being the most evil and criminally-inclined of the two; however, although the Light Fae are more diplomatic, both sides use humans as slaves, servants, and food. Bo is abducted by two Fae police detectives and brought to the Light Fae leader, The Ash, for interrogation. It is here that Bo discovers that she is not the only one who is `different'. It is also here that she meets her future romantic lovers, the wolf-shifter and police detective, Dyson (Kris Holden-Ried); and Lauren (Zoie Palmer), the human physician & scientist obligated to serve The Ash. When the Ash orders Lauren (Dr. Lewis) to examine Bo and determine what kind of Fae she is, Bo is told by Lauren that she is a succubus and that, if she wanted to, she could learn to control her chi-feeding power and sexual drive. Each clan wants Bo to align herself with one or the other, but after being forced to defend herself in a contest trial, Bo refuses to abandon her ties to humanity and determines to search for the truth about her origins and who she really is. Rounding the cast of central characters are Trick (Richard Howland), owner and bartender of the local Fae tavern, ""The Dal Riata""; and Hale (K.C. Collins), a siren & police detective working alongside Dyson. Minor characters include The Morrigan (Emmanuelle Vaugier), vengeful leader of the Dark Fae with an instant dislike of Bo; and Vex, a mesmer serving as the henchman for The Morrigan, and a darling of the Dark Fae Elders.

The women of Lost Girl are strong, resourceful, and live their lives on their own terms. The interpersonal relationships between men and women are equal in status in spite of their differences. Compared to the sex scenes involving Dyson, the first lovemaking scene between Bo and Lauren may seem tame, but it is nevertheless intense. (Fact: The pilot for the show later became Episode 8 of Season 1, and contains the initial lesbian love scene between Bo and Lauren. Regardless of what naysayers may say, from the outset the relationship with Lauren was intended to be as essential to Bo's emotional evolution as her relationship with Dyson.)

Along with the creatures, adventures, rolls in the hay, cleavage, and Bo's intrepid journey to find her place in the world with the family she creates along the way, Lost Girl is very much about a sex-positive universe where sexual orientation is not judged. The core nature of Fae and humans, and their interconnections, are not affected by any one of them being bisexual, heterosexual, or homosexual.

Lost Girl is produced by Prodigy Pictures for Canada's Showcase TV network and broadcast by the Syfy TV network in the United States, United Kingdom (UK and Ireland), and Australia. The DVD & Blu-ray contain the unedited episodes as shown on Canadian television (Season 1 has 13 episodes; Season 2 has 22 episodes; Season 3 has 13 episodes). Episodes running time: 44 minutes.

5191379,5,B008YRL6LI,Must have and it is 5 dollars cheaper here than on wal-mart.com! I love this series and I have season one on dvd and I am so happy to have pre-ordered season two!,1351814400,,162,3.9393939393939394
5191380,4,B008YRL6LI,"In season 2 we find Bo having to handle her abilities - particularly her healing - on her own, now that her lover Dyson can no longer feel love for her - or anyone else.  This plot device allowed Bo to become her own person and grow as a woman and as a Fae whose destiny is still unknown. Meanwhile, as the cover art implies, it also allowed Bo to explore the other vortex of the love triangle; she fell deeply in love with human lover Lauren.

Ksenia Solo continues to be magnificent as Kenzi and even though Dyson's broodiness caused some intense eye-rolling, Kris Holden-Ried shined as Kenzi in the classic body switching episode. The Trick revelation late in the season is bound to forever strengthen his bond with Bo and Anna Silk and Zoie Palmer's chemistry continues to be unmatched. The Lost Girl cast is, without a doubt, the highlight of this show.

The season suffered a lot from a late back 9 order but was still enjoyable overall. With Bo struggling with the darkness within her, Kenzi having a lot on her plate as she deals with her ""gift"" from The Norn, Dyson having his love back and Lauren sacrificing her freedom to be with Bo, season 3 is definitely looking up.",1349395200,17,1180,4.47906976744186

5191383,5,B008YRL6LI,"VERY MINOR SPOILERS:

For some reason when I recite the title for my review I think of the theme song from the 70's sitcom ""Maude""!

FYI, ""The Garuda"" is a flame spewing winged demon

With Dyson having made his proverbial deal with the devil and Lauren reunited with her old flame, Bo finds comfort in the arms of a Dark Fae and sometimes said Dark Fae +1!

What made season 1 great is repeated in season 2 with some added complexity, as Bo learns more about herself.
Not to say that there has been any noticeable reduction of minutes highlighting Ms. Silk's impressive cleavage.  Also, Kenzi sans the leather, in a form fitting evening gown has the effect of equaling Bo in the redirection of blood flow equation!

I watched the entire series in 3-sittings and am happy to know that there will be a season 3.  My highest recco for SyFy/Fantasy type programming.",1346112000,19,862,4.558441558441558

I Love this show from season 1 - 3. The writing style is struggling a little on a few episodes but enjoyable to watch.

**SPOILER ALERT*** They decide to kill off interesting characters in season 4 But kept the tiresome relationship between Bo and (INSECURE) Lauren alive? EW! Enough already! I have no problem with two women being in love and my review is NOT because its about two women. Regardless of gender their relationship is based on ""lust"" and insecurity"". Its disgusting! 3 seasons of that master and slave relationship is too much! IF the writers need Bo to be in a Lesbian relationship then PLEASE get her a better woman to hook up with!!!!!!

It's like watching a master and slave relationship. TIRED as a viewer with Lauren and her jealous whining. WHY DID THEY NOT KILL THAT CHARACTER OFF?? It is an sickening unhealthy relationship that is getting Really OLD to watch. I was relieved when Lauren's girlfriend pulled out of her coma. I thought, GREAT! Moving ON... Also, in Season 1: I really was drawn towards Bo's relationship with Dyson but never understood or believed there was any ""real"" love between her and Lauren, only Sex! All I saw is a ""weak"" human lusting after a superior Fae. Which is fine for awhile but it just didn't make sense to carry that relationship on and on.... It got even more disgusting in Season 3 when Lauren said to her girlfriend ""Bo"" (who needs sex with other Fae to survive) to stay away from Dyson (who is a Fae)??? I mean Ewwww!! What is this?? High school?? Jealous Lauren?...HOW UNATTRACTIVE!! If the writers/ show execs want to turn people OFF to Lesbian relationships then this is the way to do it.

However I honestly have tons of nitpicks with this season that made me drop its rating to four stars. One, some characters discussing their relationship with each other got really repetitiive, the season felt a little too long, one characters death was very stupid and the main villin didn't feel too scary. Still very good followup.

Update 11/15-Having rewatched the season recently, most of my nitpicks are still here, but I think it took longer for me to feel them this time. Definutly better the 2nd time around, but I'm not changing the rating.",1399593600,,651,4.660869565217391
5191449,4,B008YRL6LI,"Warning: HERE BE SPOILERS

In season two, seductive succubus Bo Dennis has established herself as quite the problem solver for the Light and Dark Fae, and she continues to engage with some bizarre creatures. Bo is growing in her knowledge of herself and her powers of sexually manipulating, healing, and sustaining off the sexual energy of others begins to expand. The stories in this season are definitely better and even more creative than in season one. However, the two people who Bo cares about most (Dyson and Lauren) veer off into other relationships, leaving Bo to focus on her heightening (and blah) role with The Fae. Loved most of the random little stories this season... but the grand Garuda thread/character that leads up to the show's finale was kind of a dud.

Season one was all about succubus Bo finding herself and forming her new Scooby Gang family as a P.I. for The Fae... and of course about her very passionate connection with were detective Dyson. When Dyson loses his ability to love... Bo has to move on. In season two, this is her transition period. Rebound, if you will... so I'm glad she spent it somewhat with a Dark Fae dude than with human Lauren. Then again, from a romantic standpoint... there was nothing more than teasers this season. No real passion, ultimately. Although Bo does get another sex scene with Lauren this season... those hoping for a real f/f relationship at last will have to wait until season 3. But even then, things are questionable.

I'm still convinced Bo is a man-centered bisexual, and this is pretty disappointing for me. I had hoped her interest in both men and women would be at least equal in terms of her emotions and passion. Nope. Her biggest passion has been Dyson. She wasn't left ""hungry"" with him... primarily because he has a wild wolf's passion for her and apparently she feeds off that extreme entirely. And yet, when Dyson isn't in the picture, who does she run to when she needs to feed off sexual energy and have full on sex? Men.

Like season one, Bo and Lauren get one night together in season 2 before the plot cuts in and leaves them separated. Really? Just one time?? Not only is this annoying when you want to see her play out a f/f connection (or even have a juicy f/f affair that lasts more than one boink)... but the conflicts that arise to immediately dissolve the f/f connections show some serious inconsistencies in characterization. One minute Lauren is passionate for Bo, the next she closes down. What? And it won't be the first... or second or even third time!!! I swear too much about their connection and conflicts just insults my logic. They have great chemistry when they aren't finding a way to stay apart... but I really wish some better writing would go into the Bo/Lauren thread. I guess I'll have to wait for Bo to find a female were (do they come in female?) for her to get a satisfying connection and passion for another woman. There is also one f/f/m threesome (again) this season while Bo is with her Dark Fae boyfriend, but they don't actually show it (again). Guess that's even more scandalous than f/f, lol.

Okay, that is my f/f rant.

Otherwise, the stories are really fun to watch. I was wow'ed by a lot of the imagination here. For a show that has little effects and just a few settings... it's the interesting characters and the chemistry they share that truly bring this show to life. Whoever does the casting for this show is FREAKING awesome!!! lol.

Some story highlights this season for me: the kooky Mongolian Death Worm (E5), the Fae strippers (E7), the Scooby Gang's out-of-body trade with each other (E9), capturing a Jinn (in a ""bottle"") was so creative (E14)... and Kenzi's undercover job in high school (E16) was truly hilarious stuff. Kenzi is the best sidekick ever! I didn't care for the Dark Fae, Vex, in season one... but he is totally fun to have around as a key character in this season. I never get tired of the Dark Fae sense of humor. And Bo's one-on-one encounter with the sexy Morrigan (leader of the Dark Fae) was awesomely funny and sexy (and the Morrigan's reaction to losing her assistant was priceless)... though I could make another case here at how abrupt too many of these f/f connections ended. Those two were hot together! lol. The Morrigan is a really fun and sexy character that I wish they'd done more with.

Plenty of Bo cleavage this season as well... one never tires of watching sexy-hot Bo. ;)",1399161600,,4446,4.6404066073697585

I love fantasy and sci-fi and Lost Girl takes it to the next level with snappy dialogue and well developed characters as well as a great 'love is love' message and a cool vibe about acceptance all around. The setting is the unseen world of the Fae (both light and dark) and the interactions they have with humans. The protagonist is a Succubus, a Fae that feeds on human sexual energy (way to bury the lede!) This is season 2 and season 4 is just around the corner.

The whole ""succubus"" idea is very sexy and clever, and Dyson is smokin' hot in an unusual way. Kenzi is the real star of the show as far as I'm concerned. What a doll. I was into season two until somewhere in the middle of the season, and then the episodes kept getting cheesier every week. For me, the series stopped being sensual, entertaining and kinda edgy, and just started being downright LAME. I don't know if I'm going to be able to give season three a chance when it comes to DVD, because season two was such a let-down for me.",1376179200,7,685,4.317829457364341

Whether is was Kensi summoning a really nasty fae named Baba Yaga, or Bo's complicated love-life (at some points, I was yelling at my tv for her to not be so stupid with the guy she was with), it was just one unexpected thrill after another.  Trick's past gets revealed, Bo learns more about who she is, Dyson's internal loss, it's all there.  This truly is a must-have for any Lost Girl fan.",1368576000,,546,4.71578947368421

5191517,5,B008YRL6LI,"I absolutely LOVE this show!! The beautiful Anna Silk makes the perfect main character, Bo. If you have any interest in the show, watch it from the beginning. Once you see the first episode I promise you'll want more. You will be HOOKED! Just like the trailer foretold, it's ""Impossible to Resist"".
Bo is a succubus that didn't know what she was until she was caught by the Fae, an entire race of extraordinary beings kept secret from humans. Bo meets Kensi, a runaway with street smarts and one liners that will have you rolling on the floor every episode. The two become fast friends and together, take on private investigations for both humans and Fae.
There's the love triangle between Bo, Dyson and Lauren that is constantly changing. So pick a team!
Each show unfolds a little more of Bo's sorted past and hints at just how powerful our little succubus may be.
It's a great show with twists and turns and I guarantee that once you watch it, you'll lurve Lost Girl as much as the rest of us!

The plot lines are not too convoluted, but the approach is a bit bent, so they are fun and serious at the same time.  The hookup between Bo and Dyson was pretty good, but as much as I'd like to see them get back together, I want to see Bo and Lauren make their thing work even more.

All in all, entertaining and exotic, with characters that are unique and likeable, and very, very sexy hot.  What more can you ask for?",1366416000,,637,4.048

To see a whole interview question and answer, you must go back to menu to listen to the next question there is no 'play all' button. This would be fine if the questions were not under 1-3mins, it takes longer to go back select the next one than the actual content.

5191538,5,B008YRL6LI,"Lost Girl has been compared to Joss Whedon's Buffyverse, and it does have some of the humor that made Buffy such a delight but is closer in tone to the darkness of Angel and goes beyond that in terms of sophisticated characters, plot arcs, universe and politics. Many reviewers are putting the adults only label on the series due to the fact that the protagonist is a succubus and the series does have sexual zing, but I am adding the adult label because there is enough here for the well-versed fantasy reader and viewer to analyze and enjoy.

Season Two continues to develop the world and the politics introduced in Season One but the longer plot arcs and politics of the Fae world get more attention than they did in Season One. There is still a case of the week, but it is less concentrated in the overused plot device of a private or police investigation and more focused on the world of the Fae and the coming war that threatens to destroy not only the Fae world, but the human world as collateral damage.

Dyson is still the ""beautiful, broken Wolfman,"" who loves Bo, even though he is unable to feel it thanks to the cost of a favor by the old ones and the attraction and love between the two still sizzles. Less compelling is the relationship between the doctor Lauren and Bo. I can't tell if the actresses don't have chemistry or of the character of Lauren is badly written, but this relationship is the one weak point in the Lost Girl Universe.

The supporting characters continue to be a joy from Kenzi, the human sidekick who is stronger than she appears, to Trick, the barkeeper who is also much more than he appears and the Siren who comes from a wealthy family even though he has chosen to be a police officer for the Light Fae. One time characters are also strongly drawn.

Is there sex? Sure and as Bo is a succubus, not all of it is heterosexual as her focus is the sexual energy of a person rather than their gender. If you are even a little sensitive to same sex attraction, this show isn't for you, though the lesbian scenes aren't written or played for male titillation. All of the actors and actresses are exceptionally gorgeous, even with their clothes on and the whole thing, plot, character, pretty, short and long story arcs, urban fantasy universe that uses old myths in a new way...all of it makes for some amazing television. Highly recommended to fans of urban fantasy and mythology. I for one am on the edge of my seat for the third season and everyone I have introduced the show to loves it.",1364169600,,2525,4.4707158351409975
5191539,5,B008YRL6LI,This series is like eating potato chips.  You can never stop with just one episode.  It's too much fun.  What trouble will Bo get into next?  Who are we currently rooting for in her love life?,1363910400,2,192,4.25

I've quickly come to love certain characters like Kenzi and Hale, and there were quite a few episodes that really stood out. The body switching one being one of my favorites. I also enjoy the way Bo's relationships with women aren't treated as some wink, wink nudge, nudge sort of thing. I believe that she honestly cares about Lauren just like she cares about Dyson. And all of the Fae stuff is really interesting. It's cool to see them twisting and integrating the stories into their episodes.

I love that gender preference is not even discussed, people just are what they are. Nobody ever has to 'come out'.

I have both seasons.",1362009600,,108,3.9545454545454546
5191555,5,B008YRL6LI,This show is awesome and very unique. I love every single female character is a strong woman. This show quickly became my new favorite.,1362009600,,135,4.666666666666667

5191577,5,B008YRL6LI,This is such an entertaining and well acted series! I love the Fae concept and all the actors do a great job. Each episode keeps you watching to the end. Season Two is even better than Season One. Highly recommend!,1361836800,,214,4.375
5191578,3,B008YRL6LI,"I bought this set new, but I'm only on disc 5 and it's the second one with serious play problems.  (The failing discs don't have visible scratches or gunk, so it must be subsurface manufacturing defects.)

My current DVD player is pretty good at adapting to scratches and damages of well-traveled Netflix DVDs, so for these discs to fail this way they have to be truly defective.

This refers to a Region 1 disc set, produced by Prodigy Pictures Inc., giant ape media.",1361750400,,468,4.614457831325301

5191581,5,B008YRL6LI,"And it shows so well on DVD!
I started watching this on SyFy when it first came on, and liked it so much that I decided to get the first two seasons on DVD.  There are a lot of very watchable extras on the set, and a few extended scenes vs. TV.  I would have to say that my personal favorite is Kensi, she adds a quirkiness to the show and is a fantastic side kick to Anna Silk.
The DVD set is well packaged and has good extras, although I would like to see a little more.  Overall a great set well worth the cost.",1360540800,5,514,3.830188679245283

**** POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT ****

More than ever Lost Girl is the show to watch. I love sci-fi and fantasy and this show is right up my alley.

The actors, the characters, the scripts, and plots are growing and maturing. And I don't even have to look for subtext when it's main text!!

A provocative, sexy, and daring TV show that will make you wonder why there isn't more out there like it.",1359936000,3,419,4.265822784810126

It's great and I hope the producers,writers,syfy all continue with all it's actors to bring us all more. Team Docubbus forever!!!!!!",1359763200,,387,4.542857142857143

5191602,5,B008YRL6LI,"I absolutely love lost girl, and season 2 just makes me that much more of a fan. I love the chemistry between all the characters and the storylines are great and entertaining. Definitely a show you could get lost in and watch all day on a day off. I wish there were more of Lauren in the season as I hope they will rectify in season 3. And having seen 3x01 of Lost girl.....I think all Docubus fans will be quite pleased with the awesome start to season 3!!!!",1357862400,,459,4.168539325842697
5191603,3,B008YRL6LI,"I bought this box set after waiting fruitlessly for months for Season II to reach iTurnes in the US. I received the DVD in the mail 1/7/13, one week before the season 3 premiere. I thought I would have plenty of time to watch this before season 3 started, but instead, I received a damaged product and had to exchange it for a new one, which will not arrive until season 3 starts, I am sure. A replacement is nice, but expedited shipping would be better... They don't exactly give you that option when you attempt to exchange an item.",1357516800,,534,4.35
5191604,5,B008YRL6LI,"I love Lost Girl.  I really wanted a good 1080p copy, after Syfy HD spoiled me.  Also, I really was annoyed with Syfy's BS editing, so you gotta get the whole thing and you can get the whole thing here!

Season 2, twice the viewing time!  Not enough Lauren, still, lol.  This season went off the rails here (especially poor Dyson) and there, but I'm still looking forward to Season 3.  Ah well baker's dozen better than none.

I'll update after viewing features and when I can properly expand on my appreciation of the series.  It is nice having one of my ships be canon (Doccubus).",1356912000,,582,4.4245283018867925
5191605,5,B008YRL6LI,"Love this series! Kysenio Solo is not only gorgeous, but hilarious as well. Sure, the writers craft excellent dialog for her, but I think she gets into it and really has fun with the role.  Thankfully, season three starts soon as the anticipation is too much. My only gripe are technical ones; I'd prefer a cleaner separation of the episodes and being taken back to a menu when an episode concludes. Also, the time counter shows time for the entire disc instead of the episode, and I like to go into episode three with a fresh counter instead of two hours already elapsed.",1356825600,,572,4.553398058252427

5191629,5,B008YRL6LI,"This is a very different kind of show. Of course it's from Canada. It has been compared to other shows about the supernatural, but I think it has influenced more than copied.
I believe it was a few years old before it came to the SyFy network. It's take on the folklore of the European Celts is refreshing and appears to have influenced  some tamer, newer TV shows on the American networks, like ""Grimm"" and ""Once Upon a Time"".
Personally, I like the sexiness of this show. The humor and action helps relieve the melodrama. I would recommend buying both seasons and it looks like SyFy is having at least a third.",1356220800,,612,4.464285714285714

5191632,4,B008YRL6LI,"Lost Girl Season One is good Fantasy only somewhat constrained by SciFi 's limited budget. All the characters are interesting, human and otherwise. There is a central plot that ties things together and individul episodes usually stand alone with a story that is captivating by itself, as well as advancing the central plot, which is how fantasy creatures exist in our world, in secret.  Lots of drama, a wealth of characters with different abilities - did I mention that the heroine is a Succubus? That ads a touch of sex, that fits with the story.  So what more could you ask for?  Well, better sfx, but surely imagination isn't totally dead.  You get enough visuals to enable the viewer to build on the details.  I'm happy to say Season 2 follows nicely and very much look forward to Season 3
Watch and ENJOY !!!  :-)",1356048000,2,819,4.613793103448276

8532693,4,B008YRL6LI,"Lost girl is, and remains, the greatest example I have ever seen of great characters in a bad show. If you know that phrases like ""the chosen one"", ""our destiny"", and ""fated too"" are bad signs of bad writing, then this show may cause you harm. The writing is really, really bad. Contradictory, shallow, and often boring; the actual plot of lost girl shouldn't have lasted a whole season... But it did, and I was always thankful when the next came out. The reason is simple, the cast, OMG the cast... They are fantastic. You could take Bo and Kenzie and put them in any show together and I would watch the hell out of it. Trick is interesting, the eye candy looks delicious, and they are all a fantastic mix of fun, dark, dramatic, and intriguing. This cast makes these fascinating and fantastic characters that you just, SO want to see do something, anything! So, you tune in. You shake your head, you blurt out ""REALLY!"", and you admit to yourself that this is the worst, great show you've ever seen.",1476230400,2,1001,4.5054945054945055
