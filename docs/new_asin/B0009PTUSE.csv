8064881,4,B0009PTUSE,"This film tells of two NYPD detectives who answer a help call from another cop. They speed to respond to him and

charge inside a building. But the building is the Russian Embassy. Thugs attack them. The help call turns out to be

bogus. And police cannot enter a foreign embassy for any reason, unless they are invited. An embassy is foreign

territory. Police of the host nation have no authority there.

Tony Lo Bianco plays Massi, the responding cop who loses an arm to the thugs' violence. He rages against the system

that gives the Embassy thugs diplomatic immunity. Lo Bianco as an actor is one of New York's treasures. For fifty years,

he has given strong and clear performances, in roles ranging from a gigolo-killer to a gutsy detective to an Arthur Miller

hero.

  As his partner, Hal Linden shows the talents that would later make him famous as TV's Barney Miller. He plays the

partner who could not protect Massi against the thugs. Nobody could. But that does not help him. Darkness clouds every step of

his day. With his wife, over dinner, and trying to unwind

watching TV, the scene at the Embassy haunts him. He has to do something.

  Paul Benjamin is another happy surprise in this film. He plays their squad commander, a shrill, shouting Everyman who

will ignore justice to score his own pension. He spits out the words at our heroes 'I'm going to retire with HONOR! And

you two will NOT stop me!"" He is a man on the edge. He senses that the two detectives could push him over that edge.

Despite the fine performances and moving story-line, Benjamin, as a brooding, evil presence, steals this scene. He is an

actor who deserves more fame than he got.

  Take a look at this movie and savor it. It is a tale worth telling.

8064882,4,B0009PTUSE,"Mr. Inside/Mr. Outside was a pilot film for a series that was never made.  I found it dark, gritty, and full of action, with a good plot.  The characters were realistic and interesting, and Tony Lo Bianco and Hal Linden did a great job of portraying them.  It really should have been made into a series---it was far superior to most of the cop shows of that era.",1329004800,2,362,4.294117647058823
