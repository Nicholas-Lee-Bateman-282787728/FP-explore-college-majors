8434047,3,B004LAIUAC,This was not what I expected. I thought it was like a sitcom and it's not really. It's cute but rather dull.,1429315200,,108,3.9545454545454546
8434048,2,B004LAIUAC,"Have purchased several DVD collections from Amazons library. We enjoy most of them, this one not so much.",1424390400,,105,4.888888888888889
8434049,5,B004LAIUAC,"This is the best set of these shows that is out there. 20 episodes each of LIFE WITH ELIZABETH and DATE WITH THE ANGELS. The picture and sound quality are excellent considering these are taken from 16mm public domain prints. The episodes selected are the best ones available from both series, and you even get to hear Betty sing in a few of them, and she's really good. The scripts, written in the main by George Tibbles of MY THREE SONS and FAMILY AFFAIR fame, feature frequently witty dialouge. Betty's life-long love for animals can be glimpsed here as well. Several episodes of ELIZABETH feature Betty's own dogs at the time, and ANGELS has a gorgeous shaggy dog feature in several of these. Another ELIZABETH segment features a kitten and a parrot, so you see what I mean. The set I got is actually a re-issue of this set from PopFlix, and it spreads the same exact shows over three discs instead of four, but I can't detect any lesser quality by doing this. 40 fine episodes from the dawn of Betty White's long carrer entertaing us. If you love all things Betty, you'll enjoy this set.",1417305600,5,1091,4.543147208121828
8434050,5,B004LAIUAC,"Many episodes of zaney Betty White in her early years.  Her wit is so funny.  She is truly a legend is female tv comedy.  If you like her in ""Golden Girls"" & ""Hot in Cleveland"", why not get these dvds and see her early tv beginnings...",1371859200,4,235,4.065217391304348
8434051,5,B004LAIUAC,"I am a big fan of classic television and, while familiar with Life with Elizabeth, I had never heard of Date with the Angels.  It is a terrific show and showcases classic attributes of Betty White, including her impeccable comedic timing.  There are so many well recognized (but the name name escape you!) character actors and supporting players in it that it is a delight to watch.",1361318400,2,382,4.686567164179104
8434052,5,B004LAIUAC,"I had never seen these before, loved them.  Fell in love with Betty again, after seeing these.  I only had seen her in Golden Girls.  Thanks for getting it to me so quickly.  Anyone who is a Betty fan will love seeing these!!",1341792000,6,225,4.162790697674419
