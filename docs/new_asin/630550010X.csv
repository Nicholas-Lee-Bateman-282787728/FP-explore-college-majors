7891349,1,630550010X,"Shannon Tweed just oozes sex appeal,which was the only reason I even bothered to watch this movie(and all of her other movies)While the typical short-commings of this movie would be obvious to most familiar with her work(bad acting,bad script)it unfortunatly doesn't make up for it in the other areas fans would be familiar with(lots of nudity,steamy sex scenes).Shannon Tweed is very rarely nude in this movie,and the sex scenes are very watered down and dissapointing(expect alot of close-ups of two heads kissing and slow motion sex scenes)Forget Night Fire,if
you really like to look at Ms. Tweed,check out Scorned(four stars!)Body Chemistry 4(three stars)or even Possessed By the Night(two stars)",1021248000,2,701,5.440366972477064
