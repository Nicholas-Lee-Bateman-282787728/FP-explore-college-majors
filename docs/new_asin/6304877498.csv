6096954,3,6304877498,"This film is in the style and tradition of the very funny 70's tv  send-up KKENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE, but never quite reaches its heights in terms of eith outrageousness or humor.",1458000000,,175,4.645161290322581

6096957,1,6304877498,Uninteresting. I don't even remember it well enougg to review it.,1437436800,,65,5.0
6096958,2,6304877498,"Disjointed, and way too long between laughs.  A bore.",1437091200,,53,4.888888888888889
6096959,5,6304877498,"It actually isn't really much of a movie so much as it is a bunch of funny bits varying in humor, the longest of which being a little over half an hour. Mild gore and nudity nothing horribly offensive with the exception of a commercial about a prosthetic penis (one of the funniest parts). A recurring skit about a man with four multiple personalities. A mock horror movie. And many many other short bits.",973900800,4,405,4.486486486486487
8625710,5,6304877498,"This is probably the stupidest movie ever produced. That being said, this is my second copy. Love it, never fails to amuse me.....and it's one of my fav obscure AF movies to pull out of my vast VHS collection to stump the people who ask me to choose what to watch ^_^ I recommend....as long as you have a pretty warped sense of humor. Or lots to smoke.",1523836800,,352,4.1911764705882355
8625711,1,6304877498,"Take the absolute worst episode of SNL, marry it the Goove Tube (minus the debatable wit) & if they were to have sex this would be the grotesque idiot baby that they would have. All the skits are horrendously unfunny be they about a group of cowboys trying to outdo each other on who can suffer the most pain, or a guy with multiple personality disorder going to his (fame seeking) shrink, or a laugh-less horror film spoof, they common link is how devoid of even a smile they are. But then again what do I know about comedy anymore? I lost my finger on the pulse of what America finds hilarious ever since ""Meet the Spartans"" somehow got to number one at the box office (just thinking about that still makes me ill)",1516665600,,716,4.350746268656716
8625712,2,6304877498,Another movie that I wonder if anyone involved actually watched it before releasing it.  It is like a bunch of guys that think they are funny hire some girls that were willing to take their tops off and made an amateur movie.,1514764800,,225,4.357142857142857

8625715,1,6304877498,"This movie was a waste of time to watch.  After 10 minutes it appeared to be a contender for the ""Worst Movie"" award. This is collection of short takes that would have to be much better to be considered as sophomoric humor. I would give it a negative star rating if possible.",1468627200,,275,4.288461538461538
