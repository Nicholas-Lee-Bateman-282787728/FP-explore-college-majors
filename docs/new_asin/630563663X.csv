7919398,5,630563663X,"To raise money for tuition Sam and her sorority sisters enter the Ladies Competition Challenge. Where they compete against their gym rivals in a winner takes all best of five bouts.
These bouts include:
An interracial boxing match that ends with a 1st round knockout
A kickboxing match that ends in a 2nd round knockout
An excellent GLOW style wrestling match that ends with all ten women in the ring fighting
Second interracial boxing match, this one ends with an immediate knockout that's sadistic and funny.
One amateur styled boxing match that seemed out of place and a little anti-climactic
Surprisingly the actresses took the fight scenes seriously and they did a pretty good job.  The other high lights include; topless weightlifting, a shower scene, all female strip poker, a sexy calendar shoot, women being filmed while they change, and a training montage. If you can find a cheap copy it's a good one.",1363478400,2,912,4.922077922077922
7919399,1,630563663X,"Okay, true believer, you know what kind of movie this is. This is not for the ladies' acting talents. Maybe their natural talents. Plot:(whatever little there is) Girls need money, they do a calendar shoot (teaser for softcore montage), girls play strip poker with each other (softcore montage), girls do something with their clothes on, girls end up in Foxy Boxing(c)(tm) type of boxing match. Lots of jiggling and toplessness ensue throughout whole movie.",1069027200,5,457,5.1891891891891895
7919400,4,630563663X,"If you are NOT a fan of ""sexploitation"" films--you know, where vivacious young women in various stages of undress outnumber men by a  factor of about 3 or 4 to one--then KNOCKOUTS is at best a 2 star film, and  even then only because it has something like a coherent plot.  But unlike a  lot of specious brain-candy on video, KNOCKOUTS has a novel set-up--five  gorgeous, good-girl co-eds try to earn money for school by taking on five  freak-nasty biker babes in a variety of boxing, wrestling, and kick-boxing  matches--that actually leads to a pay-off, in this case the last 30 minutes  of the film actually being dedicated to the matches in question!  Needless  to say, the ring-action of this bevy of playmates, centerfolds, and  lingerie/swimsuit models involved (including one of the Spice girls in her  days before outrageous platforms and poor make-up choices)is not going to  make you forget RAGING BULL any time soon, nor more than one or two of the  five ROCKY films.  But to their credit, the ladies are surprisingly game  and the director makes the best of it, with the pro-wrestling match coming  off as the most authentic (but then, wrestling has always been an easier  ""sell"" than boxing or kickboxing).  Even the ring announcer  during the fights is good: sometimes you wonder if he's simply playing it  straight or actually working a subtle satire of clueless ring-side  play-by-play that plagues pro-boxing shows on TV.  Again, if light-hearted  foolishness with pretty girls is what you're looking for, this one's for  you.",966556800,4,1544,4.9375
7919401,4,630563663X,"If you are not a fan of ""sexploitation"" films--i.e., where the  number of fetching young women in various stages of undress in the movie  greatly exceeds the number of men PERIOD--then KNOCKOUTS is barely 2 stars,  and only that many because it has something like a coherent plot.  As a  ""sexploitation"" film, though, it has all the requisite criteria  (the aforementioned bevy of attractive and scantily clad stars and  co-stars, seldom missed oppurtunities to display them, etc.), plus a  surprisingly well executed gimmick: the five ""good girl"" college  co-eds try to raise much needed cash by taking on an equal number of nasty  ""bad-girl"" biker babes in a series of boxing, kickboxing, and  pro-wrestling bouts that take up the last third of the film.  That these  matches actually happen AT ALL is amazing:  in Hollywood, even a mild  catfight, let alone ring boxing and wrestling, is frequently teased and  then blown off with the skill of a carnival barker.  But KNOCKOUTS actually  provides the goods at the end, though let's just say that, with the  exception of the pro-wrestling match (which is an easy ""work"", as  the WWF/WCW prove on a weekly basis), Jackie Chan has no need to look over  his shoulder when it comes to ""authentic"" martial arts action,  and a modest suspension of disbelief is necessary.  Still, given the USUAL  level of suspension of disbelief necessary to enjoy a happy little T&A  exercise like KNOCKOUTS, that shouldn't be too hard ;)!",966470400,6,1470,4.926229508196721
