8701070,4,B00TA4I6YE,"Some people like to binge-watch Breaking Bad or Game of Thrones. Nothing wrong with that. My binge-watching material of choice is Wagners Ring Cycle, and since I recently had a holiday weekend combined with Arctic temperatures outside, it seemed like a good time to revisit this Blu-ray set I purchased about a year ago. My impression was more or less the same as the first time I watched it, that this is a vivid and well-executed and on the whole most entertaining performance, by no means an embarrassment to the composer or his enormous ambitions, but falls short of being a go-to Ring Cycle or the one Id take with me to whatever Valhalla awaits. Heres the skinny, or, considering the immensity of the work, the girth.

These performances at La Scala were recorded over a period of three years, meaning some of the roles don't always belong to the same singer. We have two Brunnhildes, two Frickas,  a pair of Mimes, a couple of Fafners, and three different Wotans, one for each of the first three operas (Wotan doesnt appear in the final chapter, although his awesome presence is at all times palpable). One of the drawbacks of this is that we don't get to hear the magnificent Nina Stemme, our Brunnhilde in Die Walkure and Siegfried, deliver the glorious Immolation Scene in Gotterdammerung, but on the plus side were privileged with Irene Theorins dynamic and world-upending (literally) interpretation.

Another problem is that with so many Wotans you're bound to experience some inconsistency, both physically and vocally. As a bass, Rene Pape, our Wotan in Das Rheingold, might seem more suited for the role of Fafner and later Hagen, yet his voice has a certain worldliness and compassion, in addition to self-doubting, that makes it ideal for the role. Plus, the man has such an imposing stage presence that it seems silly questioning his suitability to play a god. Yet any attachment we might feel for his portrayal of the character is betrayed by the time we get to Die Walkure when Vitalij Kowatjow takes over. Not that theres anything lacking in his performance, on the contrary its thunderous and imposing and arguably superior to Papes. But he isn't playing the same character. For one thing, from a physical standpoint he actually looks younger than Pape with his long and wild hair, yet the events of the opera take place well after Das Rheingold. Plus hes more aggressive and sensual in his mannerisms, less pensive and afflicted with resignation, as if he hasn't yet lived through what Papes Wotan has experienced. By the time we get to Siegfried, Terje Stensvolds Wotan, now transformed into the Wanderer, is completely divorced from those previous iterations. It makes sense that Wotan might look a little older by this time, more frail and tired because of what hes been through, despite the fact that hes an immortal who subsists on rejuvenating golden apples, but his appearance in this opera is somewhat jarring, like an aging hobo telling stories around a campfire. Plus the singers voice isn't as rich as his predecessors, it sounds a bit harsh at times, and strained, lacking in intimidation. Overall Stensvold does a nice job, but I see the Wotan of this third opera as still possessing much of his earlier fire, his hubris and his ability to dominate his surroundings, qualities that aren't nearly as evident here with a performer whos so noticeably past his prime.

Our two Frickas go from matronly and long-suffering in Das Rheingold to passionate and aristocratic in Die Walkure, creating a similar sense of schizophrenia. The instability of the cast makes the viewer all the more grateful for the consistency of this cycles Alberich, sung by Johannes Martin Kranzle in one of the best performances of the role Ive ever heard, and seen. But while the cast might lack the stability of other Rings, at least the orchestra and conductor are the same. Daniel Barenboim is a veteran of Wagner, of this score, arguably the finest working today, and his depth of knowledge and insight requires a world class orchestra to achieve fruition, which the La Scala players provide. He takes his time, finding meaning in virtually every nuance of the dense orchestration, and yet the music never seems torpid or bloated. This is a Ring Cycle that shimmers, and breathes, from the croaking birth of the universe that opens Das Rheingold to Brunnhildes sunlit awakening to the crashing and bittersweet twilight of the gods, as profound and multifaceted as life itself.

The revolving door of performers probably won't matter much to viewers whose primary concern is whether or not they can actually sing, and for the most part this cast delivers. As I said earlier, both Brunnhildes are brilliant, memorable, appropriately fiery, and two of the three Wotans are for the ages. The ageless Waltraud Meier takes on three different roles, Sieglinde, Waltraute and one of the Norn sisters, formidable as all three and as one half of Die Walkures incestuous twins nothing short of a revelation. Mikhail Petrenko, our Hagen, has a deep, dark and determined tone with a hair-raising hoi-ho hoi-ho. Like all great Hagens, hes thoughtful and even sympathetic instead of just strictly diabolical, his Machiavellian machinations the result of personal hurts from a dysfunctional (to say the least) upbringing. Petrenko looks a bit like the late comedian Andy Kaufman, and when he was taking his curtain calls I half expected him to say Thank you very much, a la Latka Gravas from Taxi (sorry, I couldn't resist).

Probably the most polarizing casting choice here is Lance Ryan as Siegfried. His is not an especially pleasant voice, its reminiscent of the great Jon Vickers but without his power and vulnerability, most importantly his depth. Like Stensvold, Ryans voice can sound harsh and even strained at times, especially during the more declamatory moments, and certainly during the love duets where his lack of beauty is highlighted against the womens superior strength. This cant be excused by the length of the role because its like that from the moment he first appears onstage. Yet in spite of his shortcomings, Ryan does possess an heroic instrument thats suitable for the part of Siegfried, and eventually I grew accustomed to his voice and was even able to take some pleasure in his performance. At least his tenor doesnt clash with his fellow singers, and you certainly cant fault his commitment to the role, vocally or physically, his face aptly conveying emotions that his singing, not through lack of effort, falls short of. If you want vocal purity, look elsewhere, and I don't know if I would recommend an audio recording with Ryan in this part. But if you can live with a flawed voice accompanied by a performance that immerses itself in the character and his struggles, you might find his Siegfried one well worth experiencing.

Guy Cassiers production is minimalist in terms of props, relying on lighting and projected shadows and other images to achieve its effects, which at times works against the intent of the opera. For instance we never see an actual dragon in either Das Rheingold and Siegfried and thus never have that sense of immediate danger. Likewise, the immensity of the giants Fasolt and Fafner is expressed through their shadows rather than the singers themselves, making them less menacing, which runs contrary to the stomping and fearsome motif Wagner provided for these characters.

On the whole the production is engaging though not especially incisive, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. The Ring is challenging enough on its own that it doesnt require a conceptual approach from the director, especially since such efforts are often clumsy and can get in the way of the audiences own perception of whats going on. Still, it is nice to have some kind of unifying visual motif, such as the power grid in the Barcelona Ring, or the shifting planks in the Mets current rendition, to put across the idea that these operas are as interconnected as the Norns matrix of thread, something thats lacking here.

Not that Cassiers doesnt play around with a few abstract ideas. The most prevalent of these, and maybe the most controversial, is having a group of dancers representing the Rheingold. Its a bit overdone in the first opera, the events onstage often resembling a Bill Blass commercial with a bunch of lithe and beautiful young athletes prancing and lounging around in their underwear. Its recurrence is less demonstrative in the subsequent operas and therefore less distracting, but even so becomes tiresome. And in Gotterdammerung theres a theme of tangled naked bodies and blurred screaming faces projected onto the background which, I assume, is intended to represent the decadence and dessication of the Gibichung clan, or the downfall of the gods, or both. But overall this is a production that doesnt go out of its way to tell you what the Ring is about or try to dazzle you with any innovative ideas. Its a bright and colorful, sometimes garish and often mesmerizing interpretation of a bizarre and mythological world.

As I said, the Ring is a complex work on its own, and there are multiple ways of looking at it. Probably the simplest interpretation is that its about how love is more valuable than wealth or power, that power without any wisdom is doomed to self-destruction, and that the past and future are intertwined and subservient to the inexorableness of destiny. A more esoteric point of view is that the Ring, like the great John Ford film The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, is really about the artist behind it and his place in the world at the time of its creation. One might argue that Wagner most closely identified with the character of Wotan, a god walking among men whose brilliance, or at least he thinks so, provides him with an exemption from the values and contracts and familial bonds the rest of us have to live by. An alternative to this is that the gods instead represent the old guard of composers, and the fiery destruction of Valhalla is a metaphor for Wagners radical musical vision imperiously taking their place. One of the most amazing things about the Ring is that it invites such divergent translations and yet somehow they all seem valid.

But what impresses me the most about this work is both the scope of Wagners vision and that he was able to pull it off. For instance creating an adequate finale for fifteen hours of such precise musical and dramatic complexity, without an accidental note anywhere to be found, would seem nearly impossible for most artists, but Wagner somehow finds the perfect sendoff. Brunnhildes Immolation Scene is both spectacular and the only solution that makes any sense, bringing together all the important motifs into a complex tapestry of sound. For me its not only the greatest ending in all of opera but the greatest music, twenty minutes of sheer glory that almost functions as a mini-opera within the larger work, a stunning compendium of what weve already seen and heard, both exhausting and exhilarating. For me the Ring Cycle is the pinnacle of opera, of music, dare I say it, of art, and the fact that the man responsible for it was so detestable in his personal behavior, such an unmitigated egomaniac, makes its vast and munificent humanity all the more miraculous.

If you're a collector of Ring Cycles, like me, then this La Scala version is a healthy addition, but if you're interested in only one, Id still recommend Barenboims earlier effort from Bayreuth which is even more minimal and much darker but more consistent in its performances and quite frankly more meaningful. The highlight of this set is definitely Die Walkure which is nearly perfect, in fact I don't think Ive ever experienced a better performance. Cassiers vision hits its stride with this opera, dispensing with any overly eccentric touches and simply stepping out of the way, and the singing-acting is at its best and most enlightening. Each of the remaining operas is flawed on some level but not to the point of detriment. This is still the Ring after all, and under maestro Barenboims direction it will always be a wonder for the senses.",1515024000,2,12156,4.909975669099757
