8611067,5,6301910303,"the film is about a professor who is running for the Presidency of Europe  !?! whose platform is on artificial insemination to bring order and control(over intelligence, health,etc.) over a society.  He believes ""passion resulting in natural relation""  between man and woman can be ""prevented through therapy"".  It is also about a country girl Nanette(lovely Catherine Rouvel) who is set on having a baby without a man (through artificial insemination)  'cause her brother in law is well... you'll see.
They are placed in a picnic for the publicity of the candidate in the nature and their views are re-examined when a mythical piper's music brings them together amidst the lush summer day with wind, grass, water, other people having fun. Love the scooter scene that curiously reminds me of Amelie.  At first the movie felt more like a lazy afternoon on a hammock (as in I fell a sleep).  But I was awakened by the energy of bright Nanette skipping around in her red slippers and following her from start to finish.  there's so much more to this picnic.  The scenes are like the impressionistic paintings full of lights and motion of the elements and people.  I fell in love with Jean Renoir's summer in the country.
 Various themes include feminism, science v. nature, religion, love, family,freedom flow through. all these subjects are handled with comedy and sweetness of a picnic in the grass.",1057449600,6,1398,4.931623931623932
