5680599,4,B00BXKAOB6,"Visible Scars is an indie thriller, which released in the middle of April. This title won ""Best Picture"" at the 2012 Shockfest and there is a reason why. This multi-genred film builds momentum as it moves through Acts II and III. Beginning slowly, Visible Scars draws the viewer in to a story of abuse, which later turns into murder. This title is a compelling film, with an intriguing conclusion.

 The story is dual in nature. The film begins with two sisters, who are kidnapped by a psychopathic man and killer. They are raised in poor conditions, until their new home is destroyed by an accidental fire. The film moves ahead several years. The second half of the story involves a new group of characters. Stacy (Jillian Murray) is a young girl who is looking for peace of mind. She has recently been abused by her boyfriend, Brad (Jonas Fisch). So, she seeks shelter in some local woods. Unfortunately for Stacy, these woods are now ruled by a bloodthirsty tour de force. Let the mayhem begin!

 Some of that mayhem can be found in the film's wide assortment of characters. Viewers should try and spot the protagonist. Is there one? Instead of a hero or central figure leading the story, there are numerous minor characters introduced and outroduced often and quickly. The minor cast of characters are still multiplying into the third act of the film and even ten minutes before the film ends. This is an unusual way to develop a story. Yet, the narrative works, by keeping events onscreen interesting, with all of these diverse personalities.

 The film also pulls off a bait and switch, in regards to genres. Visible Scars begins as a crime thriller. An early murder takes place and then a kidnapping. So, viewers might be expecting a simple detective story to take place. But, at the midpoint of the film, the genre changes to horror, unexpectedly. The criminal investigation is mostly forgotten as more and more bodies turn up in some woodland. The gore increases along with the bloodflow and a few viewers might not know who is causing all of the chaos. There are a few surprises to be found in this feature, which is one of the film's more enjoyable elements.

Visible Scars is a compelling and very watchable feature. Richard Turke's first feature film is well shot. There are several great external shots involving natural scenery. The setting is a sight to see. As well, the acting in this feature is well done. Actress Jillian Murray brings a great performance with her character Stacy. Stacy has a few personalities hidden under her beautiful exterior. And, Murray hints at her character's strangeness. Other actors bring equally solid performances. Also, Visible Scars picks up speed as it moves through the film's climax and into the conclusion. Just when you expect the film to keep going, it ends too soon and the open ending might leave some wanting more. These elements and many more make this indie thriller a must-see.

Visible Scars was released, in this critic's opinion, under-the-radar April 6th, 2013 on DVD. This title is available for only a few dollars ($5-6) and this horror film fanatic would recommend this film to fans of indie thrillers. Though, viewers will have to be patient as Visible Scars takes awhile to develop. But, the payoff and ensuing chaos is well worth the wait. Visible Scars is a must-see that most will not forget. And, some viewers will even be expecting a sequel.",1367971200,3,3419,4.812606473594548
5680600,5,B00BXKAOB6,"Visible Scars is a great movie with many plot twists and a deep underlying theme. There are many elements that make this movie special. You feel a connection to all of the characters, especially Stacy. The acting is also as superb as the story line. This move has won awards for a reason.

5680601,1,B00BXKAOB6,"I made myself go through the whole dreadful movie praying for an ending that made sense of all the different directions in the writing.  Acting was just plain bad - except the boyfriend of the blonde.  He was funny and actually did a good job with a bit role.  I still don't know what happened at the end...it didn't really end as much as petered out.  I never understood how the main character was applied to the twins and where was the back story for her?  Schizo movie because you couldn't tell what direction it wanted to take or why it chose the directions it did go ...however briefly.  End of the day, the movie makes the audience have to fill in the blanks and connect the dots of which some were simply missing.  Until this movie, I didn't even know fake reviews existed.  Now, I know.",1388275200,2,794,4.35374149659864
5680602,2,B00BXKAOB6,"The acting is terrible and the story isn't the best. When the movie ends You are asking yourself ""What?!?"". Plus it seems to take forever to get to the point...very slow.",1381708800,,170,4.516129032258065
5680603,4,B00BXKAOB6,"The film starts out simply and develops levels of complexity to propel it beyond your typical feral child slasher film. Mike Gillis (Tom Sizemore) kills a prostitute (Hanna Hall) and goes ""Raising Arizona"" with her twin daughters. His wife (Carol Abney) loves the children, but they have to be kept locked in the basement(is their home a trailer?) There is also an element of cannibalism that is alluded to as part of their diet. A fire destroys the home, and the area has a reputation of being haunted.

Years later Stacy (Jillian Murray) comes to this area as a retreat from her abusive boyfriend Brad (Jonas Fisch). Unfortunately she mentioned where she was to her drama queen shallow girlfriend Kelly (Deja Kreutzberg). Soon she has company which include Kelly's boyfriend Chris (Timothy Ryan Cole) who supplies us with the voice of reason.

Most horror slashers would stop at this point, but this film develops another character, retired Detective Black (Dave Parke) who is working on the cold case of the disappearance of the prostitute and her daughters. Her sister (Diana Costa) is still alive and wants closure. Also in the woods are two herbalists who use the story to scare people away from the area and their crop.

While there is an abuse theme, the viewer is not overly exposed to it. We briefly see bruises, and Stacy getting pushed to the ground. This aspect was under developed so time could be spent to create complexity. The production is not without plot continuity issues, but then again most horror film have them.

The film interjects light elements from time to time. The acting wasn't bad, but at the same time it doesn't make you take notice. While the film exceeds expectations of a dull ""B"" slasher, it won't be a classic horror film either. The gore factor is slightly less than a classic slasher,

5680607,5,B00BXKAOB6,Richard Turke certainly does not feed his audience pablum.  Instead he takes you on a journey of many twist and turns and introduces you to a host of characters.

5680610,4,B00BXKAOB6,"Visible Scars has the unsettling quality that one used to get from exploitation films shown in less reputable cinemas before horror films went mainstream with Halloween and Friday the 13th. At moments, especially in its disturbing first act, it feels like something you shouldn't be watching, as if writer/director Richard Turke were inviting a little too much enjoyment from his viewers of evil acts, without the stylized overstatement that serves as quotation marks and lets you know ""it's only a movie"". Turke eventually gets around to more traditional horror tropes, but by then you're so thoroughly drawn into his world that these overused gore effects have recovered some of the impact they had when audiences first saw them in the Seventies. That's a neat trick, and it's probably one of the reasons why Visible Scars won Best Picture at the 2012 Shockfest Film Festival. Bypassing a theatrical release, the film has gone straight to Blu-ray and DVD.

Much of the effect of Visible Scars comes from Turke's awareness that he's dealing with a sophisticated, post-Scream audience that knows genre conventions as well as any filmmaker. So, for a long time--much longer than I would have believed possible--he toys with the viewer's expectations, then abruptly changes direction. Just when you think you've settled into the pattern of a Michael Myers killing spree, you're abruptly diverted into the possibility of alternate personalities, like the first Friday the 13th or Psycho. Lest you get too comfortable with that notion, there are tempting elements of I Know What You Did Last Summer's long-simmering revenge plot and Scream's bad boyfriend choices. And there's always the possibility of spirits that can't rest; it might be that kind of movie, like all those Nightmares on Elm Street.

One should know as little as possible about the plot of Visible Scars before an initial viewing. Indeed, the truly spoiler-allergic should skip this entire section of the review, as well as the ""official"" write-ups supplied by the filmmakers at their website and on the back of the Blu-ray case. For those unwilling to try the film on faith, I have attempted to make the following description spoiler-free.

In 1993, a misogynist low-life named Mike Gillis (Tom Sizemore, who hasn't been this dangerous since Natural Born Killers) kidnaps the infant twin daughters of a drug addict and part-time hooker, Becky Comfort (Hanna Hall, who played the young Jenny in Forrest Gump). Mike's wife, Claudia (Carol Abney), has been nagging him for children, and this is his way of silencing her. But Mike warns Claudia that the sudden appearance of two children would be difficult to explain; so the kids must be permanently confined to the basement. Claudia, who is an abused wife and grateful for any concession, complies.

Eight years pass, and Claudia has gone. It's just Mike and the two girls, whom he has raised to be utterly dependent on him in their remote cabin in the mountains outside San Bernadino. He appears to have cut off all contact with the rest of the world. When the film leaves Mike and the two girls, it is unclear whether any of them will survive and, if so, who.

It is now present day. (In a few years' time, director Turke may regret that he didn't specify a date, because the film only works if ""present day"" is 2010.) A troubled young woman who goes by the name of Stacy Walker (Jillian Murphy) is driving into the mountains near San Bernadino, having abruptly left behind her dog (whom she never leaves), her roommate and her boyfriend without explanation. She has strange marks on her body, which are briefly exposed when the sleeves of her sweater ride up, and she hastily pulls them down. She tells everyone--a waitress at a diner (Gwen Holloway), an overly inquisitive park ranger (Kevin Brief)--that she is going to her uncle's cabin to be alone and think.

When Stacy reaches the cabin, she is tormented by dreams and sightings (or are they visions?) of mysterious figures and by children's voices that may be real or imaginary. Hiking in the woods, she encounters a hippy couple in a makeshift encampment, Judy (Jules Hartley) and Sal (Connor Dylan Wryn). They tell her that no one comes around here anymore, because the woods are thought to be haunted by something ""bad"" that happened ten years ago--the stories vary--which makes this an ideal place to grow weed. Stacy stays with them for the night, but when she's awakened by more nightmares, Sal is gone and Judy tells her to go back to sleep.

Meanwhile, Stacy's roommate, Kelly (Deja Kreutzberg), has become increasingly concerned by her friend's odd behavior. When Stacy calls with instructions for her dog's care, Kelly forces her to provide a general location, but receives strict instructions not to reveal Stacy's whereabouts to boyfriend Brad (Jonas Fisch). But when Brad arrives, caring and concerned (maybe a bit too caring), he wheedles the information out of Kelly and prepares to depart for San Bernadino. Kelly insists on accompanying him, as does her boyfriend, Chris (Timothy Ryan Cole), who is afraid to leave her alone with the handsome Brad (whom Chris doesn't trust for an instant).

In Beaumont, a town near Stacy's current location, Det. Black (Dave Parke) is retiring after thirty-five years on the police force. Black hates the idea of retirement and proposes that he come back part-time to work on cold cases. (His chief laughs.) One cold case rankles in particular. The department never made serious efforts to find Becky Comfort's missing twin babies, because the mother was a prostitute and her sister, Maggie (Diana Costa) kept bringing in tips from her psychic. But Black always believed there was more to investigate. On his final day in the office, he sneaks the file out the door and begins anew. He is helped by a call from the current occupant of Becky Comfort's former residence, who has found some of her belongings buried below the structure.

As these groups of characters converge, strange things begin to happen. Many of them are spooky, some are violent, and a few are downright messy. By the end, there's carnage everywhere, and the few people who remain have yet to put the pieces together.

isible Scars was shot by venerable horror cinematographer Jacques Haitkin, whose work includes the original A Nightmare on Elm Street (and its first sequel), The Hidden and a personal favorite of mine, Galaxy of Terror. I was not able to find definitive information about the shooting format, but judging by appearance and the lack of any credits for film scanning, the movie was almost certainly acquired digitally. (Most indie projects opt for digital today, if only because it's cheaper.)

Echo Bridge's cut-rate approach to Blu-ray works best with a digital source, because there are no finicky film transfers to wrangle. The 1080p, AVC-encoded Blu-ray for Visible Scars sports a clean, noise-free and detailed image that, ironically, provides the contemporary equivalent of a Seventies exploitation film. The older look would have been cheap and grainy. Today we're used to documentaries shot on video and reality TV. By lighting spaces for visibility, not people for glamor (although several of the leads are attractive even without special lighting), DP Haitkin conveys the sense of voyeurism that has long been an essential element in the horror and thriller genres. Blacks are solid, which is essential to scenes at night and in dark interiors, especially where poor visibility is a crucial element in creating confusion (or assisting a practical effect). The color palette is muted and naturalistic, without anything too bright or saturated to enliven this world of dark deeds and buried truths. At 101 minutes with limited extras, the film resides comfortably on a BD-25, without visible compression issues.

Visible Scars' soundtrack is presented in lossless DTS-HD MA 5.1, and something is wrong with it, although I can't say whether the problem is in the disc mastering or is inherent in the original mix. The track is mixed at an unusually low level, so that I had to raise my volume level by +5 db above my usual listening level just to hear the dialogue. Even then, much of the dialogue was muddy and hard to make out, as if poor-quality production sound had been used or something had gone wrong during the mixing sessions. Since the rest of the production was professional in its execution, I'm forced to question whether something was amiss in Echo Bridge's mastering and reproduction of the disc.

Sound effects are adequate, and James Eakin III's moody score has decent, though not exceptional, fidelity. Aside from volume and dialogue issues, the soundtrack did not stand out as a disaster, although it rarely rose above mediocre. That would be consistent with Turke focusing most of his budget on effects and actors, but only someone who worked on the film can say whether the track is an accurate reproduction of what the sound team created.

Although Turke says in the commentary that he initially set out to write a horror film, he also notes repeatedly that Visible Scars is more of a thriller with horror elements. I suspect that's why audiences at Shockfest reacted so favorably. Horror films have largely become rote exercises in fulfilling genre expectations, while thrillers still demand careful attention to story and coherent narrative. Otherwise they simply don't work. Turke, who was making his feature debut, is one of those rare young filmmakers who truly seems to care about telling a good story, even though he's chosen to do it in a deliberately disorienting fashion. The disorientation is purposeful and methodical, and he maintains complete control of it throughout the film. On the commentary track, the actors, ever desirous of more work, repeatedly clamor for a sequel, and there are certainly enough loose ends to pick up. But if Visible Scars is any indication, Turke won't do so unless he can extend the narrative in a consistent and logical fashion--and still surprise us. Now that would be a novelty. Highly recommended, despite the audio issues.",1373932800,2,10112,5.014889815366289

8575078,4,B00BXKAOB6,"It's easy to see this film as something flawed, because it just tries to do too many things, right? It starts with a very well made drama about a man who abducts two infant twin girls for his wife--who desperately wants kids--to care for. The children are locked in the basement, and he later kills the wife and feeds her to the girls. Then it all of a sudden jumps to a girl who confusingly looks like she might be one of the twins all grown up, but she isn't, she's a girl who's retreating to the California boondocks woods to contemplate her legacy of abuse at the hands of father and now boyfriend. What follows is a weird hybrid of horror, police procedural, buddy travel comedy, criticism of the media, manifesto against abuse, portrait of rural California life...and there's even more that doesn't really fit in. But I make sense of this rambling, loosely cobbled together construction by thinking of it as a West coast version of Dante Tomaselli's Torture Chamber. Set in the glorious California sunshine, it's an attempt to push a lot of our cinematic buttons all at once. I might give it only three stars if it weren't for the fact that the many, many sideline characters are all extremely well delineated and well acted (as they would be in a Tomaselli film). I've watched this twice now and the second viewing did not disappoint. If you insist on perfection, skip this, but if you like the art--that is, the failed attempt to go beyond simple good composition--of horror, I would recommend this strange, shambling mass of good, partially realized ideas.",1415145600,,1565,4.694545454545454

8575081,5,B00BXKAOB6,"I don't really get the negative press on this film. It is actually a good watch. It's kind of a mix of Friday the 13th and the Hills Have Eyes, but with a more subdued, almost quiet intensity. It has it share of kills, but over all uses mood and creepy vibes over gore. Watching it felt like watching a late 70s suspense movie, but with that touch of mystery where you really don't know till the end if you are dealing with something supernatural or not.

Then of course, there is Tom Sizemore. His part is fairly small, but it is easily his best performance since Natural Born Killers. Many will compare the two roles, but this character is a totally different kind of psycho. He is also kind of mystery himself. You never really know what the deal is with him. He is just nuts.

As far as the ""cliffhanger"" ending, its really not that much of a cliffhanger. I won't say what happens, but its more just an open ended kind of deal. Again, reminding me of Friday the 13th. Regardless of that, a sequel is probably in the works.",1397520000,,1026,4.310880829015544
