2073052,1,B0002A2WFO,"I have not seen the DVD yet, but am quite perturbed that Columbia has been so slow to put out all the stooges on DVD.  First we got 7 episodes, then 6 and then 5.  Now, they are giving us 4 with two of them already in previous DVDs.  Lets all protest Columbia so that they will get back to their senses and finish the first job which is to release the rest of the episodes as they started.  Then they can do what they want with colorization, etc.  I wrote them 3 letters in the past and they never responded.  Anyone that can break through to them, I encourage you to do so.  I feel better, now.",1088380800,6,595,3.9915254237288136
2073053,3,B0002A2WFO,"as of this writing, these DVDs have yet to be released. I've NEVER been a fan of colorization (those dreaded Laurel & Hardy videos by Cabin Fever come to mind and make me want to puke)...but the beauty of these DVDs is you get a choice between color and B&W. 8 shorts in all seems pretty light (considering that 3 of them were already released on past collections), but at least they are finally releasing my all time favorite Curly short, 1940's ""You Nazty Spy!"" (I've always been a Shemp Howard fan, but there are a handful of Curly Howard shorts that I absolutely love). For fans of colorization I say have fun...I'll watch them once in color to see if colorization is as bad as I remember...then I will ENJOY them in the original B&W versions...keep the Stooges films coming on DVD and thanks for giving us the B&W option...throwing a few Joe Besser shorts on some future collections wouldn't be a bad idea, could help me appreciate Curly Howard a lot more!!!",1087948800,4,963,4.540229885057471
2073054,1,B0002A2WFO,"Oh, boy. Just when we thought ""colorized"" films were dead and buried, Columbia resurrects the corpse with an octet of Stooges shorts in that heinous format. And some of these shorts have been on DVD already! And eight shorts for $45 SRP!
This is an abortion, and I plea with all Stooge fans to boycott this junk until Columbia comes to their senses.",1087776000,4,349,4.555555555555555
2073065,5,B0002A2WFO,"The three Stooges are so funny and the short films presented on these dvds from Columbia Tristar are classics. Each film is presented in a beautifully restored black & white or new, color version. I know a lot of people will be thinking ""colorized - I remember that from the 80s and it didn't look very good"". Well in all fairness, a lot of time has passed since then; and the result of the new colorization process is absolutely no comparison whatsoever with the 80s disaster.  The result is remarkable by all standards. Technically, the process used here is far superior to anything that has come before it. Gone is the limited pallet and the ghostly halo effect that would occur when characters or objects move abruptly. Earlier colorized movies also looked slightly out of focus and detail was lost. Here the images are crisp and clear and it is easy to imagine it had been filmed in color. Above all the color looks completely natural and doesn't distract you from the movie.

 So, only the question of whether this process should be used at all remains. And this is a question that everyone has to answer for him or herself. These dvds give you the choice of watching the original black and white or the new color version. The viewer can do this at any moment during playback by pressing the angle button on the dvd remote. So many reviewers of these dvds take a puritanical stance preaching that it is some sort of crime to create a color version of a black and white film and encourage people to not watch it. How dare you tell me what I can watch, as I have already stated it is an individual, personal choice not a legal requirement! Well done Columbia for releasing these great films in this new format, I hope they are just the first of many.",1093478400,5,1754,4.492163009404389
2073066,1,B0002A2WFO,"I don't care one way or the other about the colorization.  The real problem here is that they are re-releasing shorts that were already on DVD...when there are obviously tons that have yet to be released.  Whomever is in charge of this project should be shot.  At this rate, i'll be dead before the entire Stooge catalogue is on DVD. By then there will be another format anyway.  The real sleaze tactic by Columbia is throwing in a few ""new"" ones with the other re-treads, to kind of force you to buy the thing.  Everyone knows they should just release a box of all the shorts in chronological order and be done with it.  But it looks futile, and the idiot managing this project is the real MORON!!!",1093219200,7,699,4.421875
2073067,5,B0002A2WFO,"Having seen some of the terrible colorized episodes of the Stooges in the past, I was extremely skeptical of these DVD releases.  But since they promised the original B&Ws, I decided that it was worth a shot.  And it was.

I was very surprised to see how decent the colorization turned out on these shorts.  There are many points where it looks natural for an older film.  The Stooges themselves are what makes the colorization pull you back a bit... you just know they aren't suppose to be in color, but after watching it for a while you actually get used to it.  And that's really shocking for me to admit.  I was curious, but prepared to hate it.

And really, it's interesting to see the detail they put into coloring backgrounds and such.  You'll spend one viewing just to notice all of the changes and another to just enjoy the shorts for fun.

And the B&Ws look excellent-- better than many of Columbia's previous releases.  Now if they would just release the shorts in some organized fashion...

If you don't believe me, rent 'em first.  If you go into it out of curiousity instead of the sheer want to hate it, you'll probably appreciate the work they did.  And as always, you can't go wrong with the originals.  Highly Recommended.",1093046400,3,1240,4.547511312217194
2073068,4,B0002A2WFO,"I initially gave this DVD a 1-star review without having seen it yet (idiot that I am), but after viewing it, I ate a lot of crow and promptly deleted the review. My intense skepticism leading up to it was completely dashed away by the time ""Men In Black"" from the ""Goofs On The Loose"" DVD was even finished, and all I could say after that was WOW!

Columbia did a first-rate job of restoring the original black & white prints, and VERY high kudos go to West Wing Studios for the positively marvelous colorizations! The Stooges almost literally came to life on the screen and in a visual clarity unsurpassed to this point and more than likely will remain that way. I will always love the Stooge shorts in black & white, but I have to say that the color versions are really growing on me and I find myself watching them more often!

The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is that there are only 4 shorts on each disc; I realize the time-consuming and painstaking process that undoubtedly went into this, but I still feel they could've added more shorts. At least 6 shorts per DVD would've been better. You certainly can't argue with the value of this 2-disc package; the price is very reasonable. I was sent the wrong DVD in the original shipment, but Amazon quickly rectified this and the correct ones were shipped immediately; I wasn't at all upset about that, mistakes will happen.

In conclusion, I say to those that still aren't sure about this: as a long-time and hardcore Three Stooges fan, if this can win ME over, it can win ANYONE over. Don't be skeptical and colorblind like I was; view these with an open mind and I know you'll enjoy them too!",1092960000,5,1658,4.447368421052632
2073069,3,B0002A2WFO,"To state the obvious: The Three Stooges are classic. There I said it. Not that anyone inside Columbia Tri-Star has taken notice, even though The Stooges have rarely been absent from public consciousness since their debut as Ted Healy and The Three Stooges back in 1931. From the early 30s to the late 60s this trio of chuckle-heads made some two hundred plus shorts and several feature films for their alma mater.  And although television, VHS, laserdisc and now DVD have kept their memory alive, the current trend of releasing Stooges material on DVD seems to be inconsistent at best. It should be noted that Stooge aficionados continue in their wide spread dissension over Columbia's lack of establishing a chronology for The Stooges body of work on DVD.  There seems to be no logic in Columbia's releases, often providing consumers with numerous different and sometimes overlapping gift sets. Thus purchasing every Stooge short is an expensive proposition. This is to say nothing of the various bootlegged DVDs which continue to circulate Stooge shorts in poor to down right dismal quality transfers. How Columbia chose this batch of shorts to inaugurate its new colorization process remains a mystery.

Here's the long and short of it - in the mid 1990s somebody at Columbia decided it was high time to honor The Stooges on laserdisc. So technicians went to the vaults and digitally remastered 32 short subjects in an impressive looking, limited edition box set. However, in the intervening years, DVD replaced laserdisc and, with sales of classics slumping, the new regime at Columbia decided that they would just slap any old transfer onto disc rather than take the time to repair and remaster more classic shorts. But, they still had the original 32 remastered laserdisc transfers at their disposal. So what Columbia did was to intersperse these 32 restored shorts throughout their recently released DVD series and shove in three or four truly awful transfers in between on each disc, hoping the consumer wouldn't notice, wouldn't care or wouldn't complain about the varying degrees of quality.

And now we come to yet another insult to the legacy of these immortal comedians - colorization! The two newly minted discs from Columbia -- Goofs on the Loose (which includes the shorts: Men in Black, The Sitter Downers, Punch Drunks, Playing the Ponies) and Stooged and Confused (which includes the shorts: Violent Is the Word for Curly, You Nazty Spy!, No Census No Feeling, An Ache in Every Stake) have been bastardized by the gimmick of Chroma-color, using a new and allegedly superior process than was previously made available. Despite a featurette included on both discs, in which Columbia technicians brag of the realistic representation of color with several brief examples (which I must admit look far better than anything seen on these short subjects) the results are pretty much the same.

Flesh tones are pasty and overly pink while background scenery gets painted with a broad stroke of mono or duo colorization that is about as accurate at capturing life's palette as is the state of the art of embalming.  Outdoor scenes are painted with a flat watercolor blue sky and flat watercolor green lawns and trees. All buildings are brown or grey and most suits are a flat black, grey or brown. The appearance of the Stooges suddenly wearing bright orange or red suspenders and overalls is the equivalent to watching a Mexican fiesta crash an Irish wake. The most satisfying byproduct of the Chroma-color process is that you can turn it off and watch the Stooges as originally intended -- in a series of shorts that have been very nicely cleaned up and digitally remastered in all their black and white glory.

In the late 1980s Ted Turner attempted to take his acquired MGM/Warner classic library and dye the films for contemporary audiences - the logic being that contemporary audiences were just too, too sophisticated to appreciate black and white photography as an art form. But the process so outraged film purists and those in the know in Hollywood that an actual injunction was filed against colorization by the likes of director, Martin Scorsese and others to stop Turner from destroying the integrity and purity of classic motion pictures.  Rightly relegated to the dustbin of celluloid history some years ago colorization has now unfortunately reared its ugly tri-colored head once more.

For The Three Stooges discs technicians have claimed to have done an extensive research of old costumes and first hand accounts of the colors used in order to accurately reproduce the colors on the set when the shorts were originally shot. What needs to be pointed out however is that costumes, makeup and set colors were chosen then because of how they would register in black and white. For example, green make up gives a more luminous quality to flesh tones. Does this mean that we should be watching The Stooges painted in color like a trio of not so incredible hulks?!?

The black and white image quality on both of these discs is infinitely better than what we've come to expect from Stooges shorts released on DVD from Columbia. Though a discernable amount of film grain still exists, the gray scale is nicely balanced with deep blacks, solid contrast levels and a considerable amount of fine detail. There is edge enhancement throughout but it does not terribly distract. The soundtracks have been preserved in stereo but are shrill and extremely dated. The only extra included is the aforementioned ""colorization is good"" featurette that, while fascinating in its technical information, does not dismiss the cold hard fact that colorization is still WRONG! Films should be experienced as they were originally intended to be seen. The average consumer has only recently savvied up to the fact that widescreen is better than full frame. Time for another education lesson on why monochromatic is superior to color!",1092873600,,5932,5.019308943089431
2073070,3,B0002A2WFO,"I am giving 5 stars for the clarity and sound of the stooge shorts in these 2 DVD's but only 3 stars for content. The Three Stooges are supposed to be in Black & White, but seeing them in color adds a new dimension to watching them. Whether you watch the Black & White version or the color version, either way the picture and sound are well done. These 2 new releases are severely over priced for the amount of content and for that reason I drop my overall rating to 3 stars. We all know you can put more than 4 shorts on a DVD and once again Columbia/Sony Pictures has screwed the stooge fan. They only put 4 short's on the DVD's and some of them have already been previously released. There is something unique about playing these shorts; you can switch from color to black & white at any time while they are playing using your DVD remote. Columbia's approach to releasing the Three Stooge's is all wrong. They should have taken the time and digitally remastered all of the shorts. Then Columbia should have released the Three Stooges in chronological running order in mega sets or box sets. Columbia doesn't care about the stooges fans, they only want to gouge us some more. I have sent several messages to Columbia/Sony Pictures concerning the Three Stooge's releases and haven't received a reply from them.

2073071,5,B0002A2WFO,"Why so much negativity regarding the colorization of Stooge shorts?? I'm an avid Stooges fan and agree that the black and white versions are better, because this is how we remember them for all these years. I think its great seeing the colors, they bring out new details in the episodes. I agree that the marketing is a bit of a rip off (4 episodes per DVD instead of 6) As a whole I would rate this 4 and one half stars.",1092614400,2,421,4.146341463414634
2073072,5,B0002A2WFO,"For those who want to read a brief review, it follows here -- WOW!!!

For a little more detailed review, it appears that ChromaChoice is the Cadillac of color enhancement. Watching these programs was

nearly like watching them for the first time.

All of the color choices really worked. It's amazing how natural the flesh tones (translated throughout this review as Caucasian

skintones) look. In previous colorization attempts the two things

that seem to give the systems the most problems were flesh tones and water. However, in Violent is the word for Curly, when Curly dives into the shallow puddle, ChromaChoice resisted the urge to make the water sky blue. It appears muddy, murky, and totally natural.

Heck they even gave Moe gray hair instead of taking the easy way out and coloring his Beatle haircut jet black. And Curly's scar under his left eye is much more pronounced in color that it was in the B&W version.

My wife watched them with me. Now, understand that she ""bears"" the Stooges because I like them, and as such has seen many of the

shorts. However with You Nazty Spy, she was laughing and making

editorial comments. In the first scene when Onay and Amscray are

trying to install a puppet leader so they can control him and profit off of war, she said ""It's Halliburton and the Republicans"". Then watching Hailstone, she constantly commented about how he was as clueless as the current administration. I paused the short and asked her why she was coming up with these comparisons even though she has seen the shorts several times before. ""I don't know,"" she said, ""adding color makes them seem more relavent, more funny."" This is a telling comment and probably a driving factor as to why Sony has begun this process. And I must admit, having color in the shorts makes the Stooges seem more ""alive"".

I saw no errors in the color. When stock footage is used (crowd scene in No Census No Feeling for example) the color is not as vibrant. This seems to be a challenge to any color process. I recall when Mailace in the Palace was colorized for the 60th

anniversary, they used a totally washed out PD print which caused a totally washed out colorized film. Since the stock footage was made at a different time and probably under different lighting, the difference between its color vibrance and the color of Stooge recorded scenes is telling.

Talking pictures, radio, and television were all considered fads by many when they were first introduced.  However there is no denying that the marketplace has considered these entertainment

media to be lasting and viable.  Only time will tell if the new Sony process enters this realm, but first impressions show that the product is high quality and should have a usable place in the entertainment genre.",1092441600,6,2772,4.7677824267782425
2073073,4,B0002A2WFO,"""If at first you don't succeed, keep on suckin' 'til you DO succeed!""
  And as a Stooges fan for well over forty years, I must say that Columbia Pictures HAVE succeeded with these new versions of the Stooges' classic shorts.
  I, like many others, turned up my nose when I first learned of these new colorized versions; however, I purchased both DVDs yesterday and have watched them many times since then and I admit it: I was dead wrong! These new versions are GREAT!
  The ""bonus"" short included on the DVDs, ""Colorizing The Classics,"" explains the meticulous research that went into creating these versions, and displays the obvious affection the art directors of the new versions have for the Stooges' legacy.
  Besides, if you REALLY can't stand the color versions you can always watch 'em in black and white, and the B&W versions are NOT simply the colorized ones with the color ""turned off,"" they are separate restorations of the original B&W versions with only minor digital ""cleaning up"" of scratches and other defects in the original film stock.
  Now I'm ready for some SHEMP shorts with the new and (IMHO) improved look!
  NOTE: The only reason I gave this release four instead of five stars is that on one of my DVD players, the little icon for ""camera angle"" which you use to ""toggle"" between the color and B&W versions stays on the screen and will not go away. This is annoying, and is most likely the fault of the player because it doesn't happen on my other, older DVD player. But it is annoying enough for me to knock the set down one star.
  By the way, I noticed another reviewer complained about ""missing"" Stooges shorts and their feature films. All the Stooges' feature films that I am aware of (""...In Orbit;"" ""...Around The World In A Daze;"" ""The Outlaws Is Coming;"" etc.) and even some of the more ""questionable"" features, i.e., ""Stop! Look! And Laugh!"" with Paul Winchell, are currently available on DVD. Besides, most of those feature Curly Joe DeRita or Joe Besser and frankly do not show the Stooges at their best.
  Yes, there are MANY original Stooges shorts which have not made it to DVD yet. But the fact that Columbia/Sony spent so much time and money on these ""new"" versions can only bode well for the future of the Stooges, and seems to indicate a commitment on the studio's part to preserve the great comedy legacy of the Three Stooges!

2073075,5,B0002A2WFO,"To one old enough to remember the anti-colorization hysteria of two decades ago (the execrable Woody Allen et al. testifying against Ted Turner's colorizers before a Congressional committee with nothing better to do)these disks make one thing clear:  colorization has advanced by leaps along with the computer technology that makes it possible.  No more pale, washed out pastels; these disks have rich, saturated, primary hues, almost like the old Technicolor.  They even have convincing Caucasian fleshtones.  At first it's slightly jarring, but any nostalgia for the black and white quickly disappears upon viewing.  I can't say why, but the color makes the images more lifelike and immediate; it seems to enhance the clarity and detail of the image rather than obscure them (a charge often made against early colorization).  And, I swear it, the Stooges are funnier in color!  The opposition to colorization always had a tenor of liberal puritanism about it (You make like it better in color, but you're not allowed to watch it that way--we say so!!).  And yes, there are some movies (mostly film noir and nouvelle vague) that it makes no sense to colorize.  Perhaps these are 10% of the total.  But for 90% of the films for 90% of the people, the new technicolorization is just great.  A chance to experience old favorites in a new way.",1092441600,4,1340,4.9641255605381165

2073078,3,B0002A2WFO,"I agree that Columbia/Sony has botched the job of releasing Stooges' DVD'S. It seems to me that whoever is making these decisions regarding which shorts to release doesn't know a damn thing about the Stooges or their history. For example, with so many great Curly and Shemp episodes not released why would you put out that horrible ""Stop Look and Laugh""...I wouldn't want the thing if it was free. That being said, in regards to the colorization, I think people are complaining about it too much. To me it is just a novelty to be able to watch the shorts that I have seen so many times in a different way, even if it is 'fake' color. As for the cost, you can get both DVD's for $31 on Amazon which is much less than most stores and not too bad for 2 DVD's. I guess my biggest complaint would be that there are only 4 episodes on each DVD and some of them are 're-runs'. I will check out the colorized Stooges because it will be a conversation piece and maybe even a collector's item someday.

You Nazty Spy was filmed and released a full nine months before Chaplin's The Great Dictator.  So give the Stooges some credit!!

Instead, they will be giving us their interpritation of the styles of the day.
My question is: Will the B&W presentations be true B&W or just mono-chromatic (no color) viewings of the colorized versions?  If it is just mono-chromatic, the grey tones could look very different than the original un-altered B&W grey tones.
Now, they must think we fans are just Stooges and will not notice the duplication of titles from previous DVD releases.

It really makes these shorts Pop!! Of course on same disc you can watch it in B&W.
After watching these shorts/features in Color - I Want a whole Stooges box-set in Color!!
I can't relate to those who are against the Stooges being (also) available in color.
Must be exhausting, time consuming & $$ to the specialists who color these.

8024974,4,B0002A2WFO,"I have already written a separate review for each of these collections [each is available as single disc, 4-episode set, as well] where I gave my opinion of the color and the content.  Having owned them for several months now, I find myself choosing the color versions over the black and white each time I view the episodes.  In my youth, having watched many of the episodes over and over on TV, in black and white, and in un-mastered versions, I must say that I enjoy these brilliant remastered films, especially in color.  The color appears natural, and, for me, adds quite a bit to the overall experience and enjoyment.  In fact, many of the reviews of the color versions are quite favorable.

But, I will only speak for myself.  I will not try to speak for other fans, or for ALL fans, for that matter.  ""Purists"" are certainly entitled to their opinion.  Their feelings are valid.  But being a purist doesn't necessarily give one higher authority or integrity.  A preference is a preference.

Some reviewers have commented on the lackluster sales volume for these sets.  I have not seen the statistics on the sales, although my guess is that these have not been monster hits.  But, part of that, I suspect, is due to the fact the the price for each set is not cheap, especially in light of the fact that only 4 episodes are featured per set.  Personally, I ordered mine via Amazon Marketplace vendors and paid between $10-$12 for each.  Not bad.  [I suspect that the colorization and remastering were no cheap endeavors, eh?]

And...since the sets offer the option of viewing the episodes in either color or the remastered b&w, to protest you have to be totally, even morally opposed to the colorization!  For my part, if the studio releases more volumes, I would likely purchase them, depending on the specific episodes included. I will say that the inclusion of only 4 episodes per disc is skimpy and ungenerous, and even unsatisfying.  That said, however, for many of us, the color opens up a fun little new world.",1157068800,2,2022,4.6770538243626065
8024975,3,B0002A2WFO,"Technically speaking, if one considers the B&W and colorised versions as separate entities, there are 8 shorts on each of the discs here.  This set could have been a real winner, and have sold a lot lot better, had there only been that same number of shorts, with no colorisation and no retreads from earlier discs.  ('Violent Is the Word for Curly,' 'Men in Black,' and 'Punch Drunks' have all already been released.)  Instead we get this, a two-disc set that only contains 4 shorts proper apiece, with 3 of the 8 having been previously released on DVD.  It's an insult that classic shorts like 'An Ache in Every Stake' and 'You Nazty Spy!' should finally be released on a colorised DVD instead of in B&W only, on a proper disc with a realistic amount of shorts.  Yes, the viewer does have the option of watching them all in B&W (and at least there's a ""Play All"" button, a feature that was missing on just about every previous disc in this series), but just the fact that there are colorised versions is wrong.

I agree with other reviewers who have pointed out that if the researchers had really been doing their job (as they claimed to have done on the self-congratulatory featurette on both discs), they would have found out that the colors they used were not the colors that were actually used.  Certain colors like purple and green were used a lot, for example, because of how they would register on B&W film stock, the same way that certain colors are used in modern movies because of how they'll look on color film stock.  The colors dubbed in with Chroma Color just look jarring and fake, although I will admit that they do look more natural and lifelike than those in things from the first generation of colorisation.

I also agree that this was a really odd choice for colorisation.  It seems as though most of the classic comedies from this era are just about immune to people who otherwise dismiss anything in B&W.  Some people will claim that old movies will find a wider audience if they're shown in colorised form to the new generation, but whose fault is it that a lot of younger people today have no interest in most stuff that's over like 10 years old or consider something from only 1984 to be a classic movie already?  They're not appreciating it for what it is then if they can only watch it in color, and it's their loss, ultimately.

Real fans aren't interested in colorisation and would like nothing more than a proper DVD release of all 190 shorts instead of these stupid ""themed"" discs and now discs that only have 4 shorts apiece and include colorised versions.  It's no surprise that these colorised fiascos sold very poorly, which is why we haven't seen any Stooge DVDs since these came out.  They didn't sell poorly because people weren't interested in the shorts themselves; they sold poorly because real fans don't want colorisation and a bunch of retreads.  And yet I can't bring myself to give this a lower rating, because as badly executed as this is, at least the shorts (for the most part anyway; I find 'Men in Black' to be kinda overrated, and I don't find 'Playing the Ponies' to be so great either) are great stuff, and it is great that some of them have finally been put out on DVD, even like this.",1156550400,,3242,4.535162950257289
8024976,5,B0002A2WFO,"This collection is soitenley worth your money.  This 2 DVD set, 8 shorts in total(allbeit a bit skimpy), are amazing quality and is the best you've ever seen the stooges, even better, you have the option to watch them in full color thanks to technology.

Both DVD's have unprescedented picture quality. Whether you are watching the digitized color or the remastered black and whites, the picture is crisp and clean and there is little if any distortions between the eight twenty minute shorts.

The 8 shorts, all from the 30's and a few in the 40's, most soitenly during the prime time of the stooges era (All Curly), are some of their best shorts ever made. I am waiting for the very first stooge shorts Hoi Poiloi and Women Haters which are viewed by many as their best ever skits.

The color factor of the collection is the main selling addition, and 8 shorts is a bit skimpy for 2 DVD's (about 2 hours total), Columbia could have added at least 10 shorts on each DVD, but I still say seeing them in color and the remastered original prints look is worth your hard earned dough.  I personally love the color addition and it's amazing how they can take a 1930's short and make it look like it was released yesterday. It really makes you feel like the short was truly filmed in color. It doesn't look too synthetic or fake, the realistic color with skin tones, color backdrops and every thread of clothing is a site to behold.

I admit, some shorts look better than others, and the indoor scenes seem to suffer the most, but when the action is outdoors, everything looks a bit more natural. When you view the shorts, take a close look at the trees (most notingly in the ""Sitter Downers Episodes"" when they are working on the house, it's amazing how a computer can bring the color and environments to life. At times I thought the skin tones of the stooges was a bit off at parts, they sometimes have a sunkist orangy tint, but considering the age of these shorts,(We're talking 70+ years here people) what is not to like? Don't want to bother with the color? No problem. With the press of the ""angle"" button on your remote, you can instantly go back to the remastered black and white originals.

 The first DVD includes the rare Violent is the Word for Curly"" You Nazty Spy"" ""No Census, No Feeling"" and ""An Ache in Every Stake"". Certainly not some of their best efforts, but the rare ""Violent is the Word For Curly"" is a must have for fans. You Nazty Spy"" really is a funny spoof on the Hiter Regime and Moe makes a terrific Adolph. An Ache In Every Stake is outrageously funny as Curly and Larry really take beatings. Seeing them try to cater to a party is a funny idea within itself. No Census, No Feeling is probalby the weakest of the bunch, but don't think it's not entertaining, it's s till prime era of stooges when they had their most energy, so a true fan will love every one.

DVD 2 includes Playing the Ponies. This particular short was never released on DVD. Hard to believe considering this is one of their memorable ones. The spoof starts out with the stooges running a restaurant with Curly of course doing all the hard labor in the kitchen. They get suckered into selling the restaruant and trading it in for a run down horse. The lame story may sound silly but the energy and fun filled slapstick humor of the stooges manages to work throughout the 20 minute spoof. Men in Black, one of their earliest shorts, which was nominated for an Oscar, is one of their best shorts ever made. Stooges portrayed as Doctors will get your gun wrenching throughout. The Sitter Downers contains enough slapping and bashing of Larry and Curly to do most stooges fans in, Moe really lays into them and the smacking and eye-poking and is as funny as ever. Watching them attempt to build a house for their wives is funny within itself. Pop Goes The Weasel, a bit of a take off of the other future (boxing/wrestling) short called Grips, Grunts and Groans (1937), is a short that was never released on VHS and a rare find for stooge fans. One mentioned the fact that this short was censored or edited out, I 100% guarantee it is uncut and very uncouth, you won't be disappointed. The ending sequence he was referring to that was left out was regarding ""Grips Grunts and Groans"" which was released later in the 30's.

I seriously like what Columbia is doing with bringing out remastered shorts. If the addition of color does not entice you, you may not want to spent the 40 smacks on just 8 shorts, but know this up front... whether you're watching this in black and white or in color, this is the best the Stooges have ever looked, so keep that in mind. They want to give us the best possible Stooge collection and this is a good start. When will there be more though???

 The shorts are not reprints of the VHS or prior DVD releases. They truly are remastered from start to finish and being a fan of the stooges for 20 years, I can honestly say I've never seen a single short look better than on these two DVD's. The colorized versions are very well done and they were painstakingly conceived by some real savvy people and some top notch technology. A nice little bonus on how the shorts were remastered in color is included and quite interesting if you're wondering ""how they'd do that?""  I hope the two DVD's offered are not the last, as I would love to have every stooge short ever made (remastered) and in color on DVD. If it takes years to have this accomoplished, I would be willing to wait. Well worth your dough if you're a fan especially if you want the absolute best. Moe, Larry and Curly would be proud.

The color was also wonderful - you couldn't even tell they were filmed in BW - and you experience the Stooges from a whole new perspective. I can understand the viewpoint of the anti-colorization crowd (that it's vandalism to colorize old films) but they seemed to really do well here... and like I said, the BW versions look better than ever.

My only complaint - and this is nothing new - is that four shorts per disc is far too few. There should be at least ten per disc, but I doubt we ever see that.",1100217600,4,706,4.1911764705882355

8024980,3,B0002A2WFO,"Color?!?  No Way!  At first that's how I saw this, as some things should just be kept in B&W.  But, I try to keep an open mind so I tried it out.  I must say that I am impressed at the job they did for the color.  It gives it a feel of the shorts being made not that long ago (even if the colors are pastel), and a thought that the stooges are still alive (given what they look like in color).  Anyway, I will not be negative towards the color as the B&Ws are still available and this was obviously not easy to do.  Unfortunately, there are 2 big reasons of why this didn't get 5 stars.  1:  They can obviously put more than just 4 shorts put dvd, but knowing how corporations are, it could be a money thing.  2:  The shorts are not even in order which boggles my mind.  I would not want to have to go through dvds trying to view these in order.  I would rather watch from the 1st short (only short to be a musical) to the last Shemp short (I will not count Joe Besser as he had a contract refusing to take much comical abuse).  Why they don't do that I don't know.  Especially since if it was that hard to make it in color, then there shouldn't be a reason of not putting it in order.  Then again, it could have something to do w/ the each stooge's families.  Who knows.  It is still worth having for a collection, but they could have still done it a lot better.",1096070400,3,1363,3.9667896678966788
