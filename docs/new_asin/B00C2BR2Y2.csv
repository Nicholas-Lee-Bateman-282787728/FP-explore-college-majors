8576477,5,B00C2BR2Y2,Excellent films depicting the harsh life in the Tokyo of the sixties. Remarkable for its stark depiction of exploitation of young women seeking sexual and social freedom. The older generation having suffered the disastrous World Wae II defeat as well as betrayal of its imperialistic ideals (also admirably dealt with in Shohei Imamura's films) are simply unwilling to impose discipline and understand the younger generation will to rebel. The young actors are excellent throughout and Oshima already at this early stage of his career shows himself to be a true visionary.,1434585600,,572,5.2967032967032965
