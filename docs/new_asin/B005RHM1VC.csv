8484302,4,B005RHM1VC,"Paramount Pictures present ""LUCKY JORDAN"" (1942) ~ (84 min/B&W) -- Starring: Alan Ladd, Helen Walker, Marie McDonald, Sheldon Leonard & Lloyd Corrigan

Directed by Frank Tuttle

Lucky Jordan (Alan Ladd), cynical gambler and racketeer, finds one thing his luck and connections can't fix: the draft board. In the army, he fits like the proverbial square peg, and deserts to find his former henchman selling the mob's services to enemy spies and saboteurs. Meanwhile, Jill Evans (Helen Walker), the attractive WAC he's taken hostage, hopes to reform him (by any means at her disposal). But it takes an unexpected plot twist to make Jordan change his ways.

Alan Ladd had a style as a gangster that counterpointed well with the wonderful Sheldon Leonard. Helen Walker presented an unusually perky, sexy look that was never really exploited in the movies.

This film in some ways is a cult 'classic' -- includes light comedy, spy thriller as World War II was in full swing, This is one of my favorite Alan Ladd films.
