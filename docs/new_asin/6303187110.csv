Every thing about this movie looks like a winner. The set up, the jokes, the characters, the plot...all potentially funny. But somehow the transition from idea to reality took a very wrong turn, and nothing, and I mean nothing, works. Sure, there are a couple of smiles, but somehow the over the top self-absorbed contractor who should be comic, ain't. The poor schlep hounded on all sides could be amusing, but isn't. The business competition--great idea! The incompetent cop who knows everything. Good stuff! But as Terry Bradshaw says after being skewered by Frank Caliendo, ""Not funny, Frank, not funny!""

No need to write much; hard to imagine anyone reading this. But I paid real $$$ for this DVD and was disappointed. It was not insulting or annoying, not exasperating or cheap, it just didn't work. Not sure if that was the director, the second tier cast, the actual script, or what. But there's a very, very good reason you've not heard of this. It is indeed remarkable that so many promising ideas could fail so completely.",1284940800,,1187,4.813725490196078
7843116,4,6303187110,"This very funny comedy stars George Wendt as a laid back kind of dude. His up tight, mean wife, Robin Duke. This is just a classic comedy. John Candy directs and has a small cameo as a Russian terrorist. This movie is so much  funnier and better than most expect it to be. It costs a lot, I know. But  at least rent it or find it somewhere.",961804800,,340,3.985294117647059
