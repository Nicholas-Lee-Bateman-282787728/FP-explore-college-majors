-X Division Championship Match, Zema Ion (Champion) vs. RVD: Its the Pretty F'n Dangerous champ vs. The Whole F'n Show to kick off the show and despite only being made 3 days before the show this is a good opener.

-Joey Ryan vs. Al Snow, If Joey wins he gets a full time TNA contract: After not winning his TNA Gut Check contract thanks to the judges, Ryan disrupted Impact broadcasts enough that he was offered a one show contract against one of the judges Al Snow.

-TNA Knockout Championship Match, Miss Tessmacher (Champion) vs. Tara: Teacher vs. Student here as Tara had recently turned on her friend Tessmacher and Tara also had been bragging about her new Hollywood boyfriend, which they felt the need to point out at times for some reason.

-TNA World Heavyweight Championship Match, Austin Aries (Champion) vs. Jeff Hardy: There's some one upping early on with Jeff getting a good amount of boos, some good mat wrestling by both though Austin shines more here. Aries does some showboating allowing Jeff to get some moves in but just for two, then on the outside he throws the champ into the steel steps. Hardy misses the Whisper In The Wind, Aries hits an elbow off the top for two, then works on the neck and back with moves like a nice backbreaker for two.

The Starstruck brainbuster is hit but only two, Jeff hits a Twist of Fate, then the Swanton and covers to win the title to a chorus of boos. 8/10.

For being the best show of the year from TNA this was a pretty good show, the main event matches were good to great and beyond the Snow/Ryan match the whole card had a big time feel to it. I would certainly recommend this to a wrestling fan as its certainly a quality 3 hour show.",1358553600,2,8085,4.363213811420983

8561566,5,B00B2OG2TQ,"Bound for Glory ranks with Destination X as the top 2 TNA ppv's of the year.
Solid card. Roode vs. Storm is my favorite match on this one.
Sting's Hall of Fame induction is a great bonus too.",1365552000,,191,4.052631578947368
8561567,4,B00B2OG2TQ,"The X-Division Championship match between Rob Van Dam & Zema Ion was fun but not stellar. The Television Championship match between Samoa Joe & Magnus was solid but could have done better if given more screen time. The Street Fight between James Storm & Bobby Roode was a hardcore,smash-mouth,bloody,ECW-ish brawl. The Al Snow-Joey Ryan match was not bad but a little boring. The 3 way World Tag Team Championship match(Chavo Guerrero Jr/Hernandez vs Christopher Daniels/Frankie Kazarian vs Kurt Angle/AJ Styles) was not great but pretty good. The Knocksout Championship match between Tara & Miss Tessmacher was so-so at best. The No DQ tag team match between The Aces & Eights against the team of Sting & Bully Ray was also a smash-mouth,hardcore,ECW-ish brawl with a twist ending to boot. The World Championship match between Austin Aries & Jeff Hardy was a high-flying,dynamic,dramatic match of the night. I give this PPV a 7 out of 10.",1360800000,2,939,5.064516129032258
8561568,4,B00B2OG2TQ,"X Division Champion Zema Ion vs. Rob Van Dam - RVD started out using his educated feet early causing Zema to attempt to take his legs with a dropkick before taking RVD down completely with a head scissors as both men traded momentum with high flying moves such as a top rope side kick, twisting spike DDT, top rope flip suicide dive, and missile dropkick.  Each man delivered an impactful move of their own with Ion dropping during RVD's rolling monkeyflip in the corner causing RVD to drop headfirst onto the turnbuckle & later Ion being elevated in the air with RVD catching him with a dropkick in mid-air.  This was a good athletic match that had some nice spots.

Television Champion Samoa Joe vs. Magnus - The former tag team champions met here as both men started working a clean match against each other before Magnus threw the first sucker punch over the referee to gain control for a bit including a running elbow to the back of Joe's neck.  Joe was able to catch Magnus when he went to top rope & unleashed some stiff offense like a snap powerslam, powerbomb, and STF before Magnus regained the momentum with his trademark top rope elbow while being able to keep countering Joe's attempt at a real naked choke submission.  Real good back & forth match between the two.

Street Fight Match with Special Enforcer King Mo: James Storm vs. Bobby Roode - A year in the making here between the former Beer Money partners that started off with Storm taking the fight right to Roode bouncing him off the guardrail & apron.  Both men would would get in Mo's face at one point as Roode gained the advantage busting Storm open using the ringpost & chair before taking the match back into the ring where Storm would regain the advantage using a kendo stick & trash can in a way that the commentators could only refer to as ""bad vibration"" as the match went to the ramp way with a snap hanging DDT on the ramp that caused Roode to bleed while Roode was able to deliver his spinebuster on the ramp as well.  Things really picked up after this as you saw more weapons being used by both from thumbtacks, the timekeepers table, one item given by a fan at ringside, and the one weapon that has been the key instrument since this whole feud started.  This was a bloody old school brawl to say the least with some ""extreme"" elements in regards to the weapons that you don't see put together like this anymore.

Al Snow vs. Joey Ryan - After months of Joey Ryan making his presence known during the ""Gut Check"" segments, he got his chance to earn the contract he's wanted here.  Al attempted to give Ryan a wrestling lesson by first showing him up with some amateur wrestling then constantly staying one step of Ryan offense with basic moves like a side headlock takedown.  Joey was able to gain an advantage when Al was distracted by the referee before but kept showing off & playing to the crowd eventually allowing Al to gain it back embarrassing him by ripping at his chest hair, catching Ryan in the apron skirt, and giving some ""Head"" but it was the appearance of another man who's had his issues with the management in TNA that not only made the difference but started a new alliance.  The match did it's job as far as telling a story between the two men but wasn't much as far as in-ring action.

Tag Team Champions Christopher Daniels & Kazarian vs. Kurt Angle & A.J. Styles vs. Chavo Guerrero & Hernandez - With Kaz & Daniels (who Taz had fun with based off the colors of their ring outfits) being the odd men out, they stayed on the floor in the beginning so they wouldn't get tagged in making the other two teams fight each other first only to make the blind tag when one of the legal men were already down which started to become a trend with all the teams making blind tags except with their own partners.  Everyone had their various moments to stand out & make an impact such as Hernandez showcasing his strength with holds like the bearhug into release belly to belly suplex & drop backbreaker, Kurt Angle with 3 straight german suplexes followed by a top rope release suplex that sent one partner into the other, Daniels' with a STO that turned Styles inside out, and everyone going aerial with moves like Air Mex & head scissors & a springboard off one ring rope to the other in the ring to the outside.  This was a real good match that saw everyone working their tails off resulting which had some crazy sequences & insane spots.

Knockouts Champion Ms. Tessmacher vs. Tara - This third match in their ""teacher vs. student"" series against each other but under completely different set of circumstances as Tara turned against Tessmacher after No Surrender under the advice of her ""new boo from Hollywood.""  Tess started out going for quick covers early only for Tara to result to using the referee for a distraction & resorting to dirty tactics like choking while also using her power to focus on the midsection before Tessmacher was able to make a comeback with a head scissors into a DDT but it was one missed opportunity that allowed the opening for Tara to capitalize.  This was a decent back & forth match but the weakest out of their trilogy however stay tuned afterwords for the reveal of who the ""Hollywood Celebrity Boo"" of Tara was...or at least a celebrity of TNA's standards.

No Disqualification Match: Sting & Bully Ray vs. Aces & Eights - Either Aces & Eights go away forever or have complete access to TNA with Sting & Bully showed unity coming into the match with Sting wearing Bully's shirt while Bully had on Sting's war paint while Aces & Eights came to ringside with their hostage in Joseph Park handcuffed to the guardrail at ringside as Sting & Bully attacked right away on the outside using the steps & guardrail & ringside table including a broken piece being busted over their head.  Aces were able to gain control due to mistiming by Sting & Bully as they went as they traded momentum back & forth when more members of Aces arrived causing Joseph Park to take matters into his own hands as Sting & Bubba took control back with their own Road Warriors tribute before another member arrived making all the difference here as more members continued to arrive along with help from Hulk Hogan himself before we finally had one of the Aces & Eights members revealed that shocked everyone...more Bully Ray than anyone else.  This was one of those matches that had good action along with so many different storylines & angles coming together well.

World Champion Austin Aries vs. Jeff Hardy - Hardy (complete with a new entrance theme) & Aries tried to show up each other early on with shoves & slaps before Aries was able to take control & really throw it in Hardy's face causing Jeff to lose his cool & make Aries pay for it before giving a ""receipt"" for the showing off.  They took the match to the outside where Hardy used to guardrail & turning Aries upside down into the steps before returning to the ring where Aries was able to take advantage of a mistiming by Hardy working over the back with various holds like an under grip backbreaker, grounded abdominal stretch, and top rope dropkick o the back.  The action continued to pick up with Hardy countering Aries brainbuster & Aries delivering two back to back suicide dives squishing Hardy on the outside between himself & the guardrail with such impact that Aries cut himself above the eye before the match got taken to the ramp with Hardy's head taking a nasty bump.  This was a really good main event here as they told a good story with the crowd also being split adding to the match.

In the end, this show is what we've been getting out of TNA for the past few months in that it's truly ""Total Nonstop Action"" with there not being a bad match on the card with some solid wrestling action while also having entertaining moments so this is a card I would recommend for a viewing.",1360540800,,7869,4.515471167369902
