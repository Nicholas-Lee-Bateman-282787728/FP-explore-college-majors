8601431,3,B000FO43AO,on the cd charlie wilson in on it. on the dvd you see him at the very begining but no more after that. i suspect he was edit out of the dvd. in my opinion c wilson was the best part of the cd. also had a hard time finding a player that it would play on. ending up getting it to play on my portable dvd player. out of about 6 pyers that was the only one i could get it to play on.,1182124800,,379,3.4705882352941178
