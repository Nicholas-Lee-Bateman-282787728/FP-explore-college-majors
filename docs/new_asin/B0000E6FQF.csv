8002006,4,B0000E6FQF,"New Line Cinema took a new direction from the old Nightmare series by literally bringing Freddy out of the screen.  Krueger comes to life to stalk actress Heather Langenkamp having been laid dormant in the unproductive Nightmare Series for too long.
Wes makes a daring and successful attempt to resurrect Freddy. He returns the demon to his dark and humourless self giving him a terrifying new ""shadowy"" look.  He furthermore blurs the line between reality and fiction bringing the slasher into the very world that is suppose to be our sanctuary.
With a palette of special effects, Freddy returns to the claw abandoning his creative murders in exchange for the ""catch and slash"" Nightmare was originally famous for.  Fans of the saga must be willing to accept this long-winded, stand-alone film at its newest angle and embrace the post-modernism.  For those looking for another addition to the series, I'd recommend Freddy vs Jason.",1073174400,,932,5.071895424836601
