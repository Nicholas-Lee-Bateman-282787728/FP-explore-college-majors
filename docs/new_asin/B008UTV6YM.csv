5317299,5,B008UTV6YM,"Cory does a really good job here--his video presentation is interesting, upbeat, and he seems really ""into"" giving a great series of lessons.  I've seen a lot of Guitar videos and this is one of the best--from the first examples, i'm learning new licks or relearning licks the ""right way"".  Highly recommended for anyone from advanced beginner who loves blues and guitar and is wondering what to do next with the pentatonic scale.  So many times a video will show you a lick, but it's sort of a cold presentation--not here--Cory just seems like a great guy who loves his subject.  Moreover, the Guitar Lab series has a lot of support material, including PDFs of all licks plus a MIDI player that demonstrates the timing of the notes.  But the best part is Cory's teaching--he's a natural and I recommend this video for anyone who wants to get the low down on Freddie King, SRV, the Rev. Billy G., Johnny Winter...there's a lot here.  I like this video over other videos that have 100-200 licks since the material is presented better and the back up info is better on the disk.  Very good job, and $20 is a bargain.  It's like six months of lessons (at 2 licks per week) for $20.00--you can't beat it.",1374969600,6,1200,4.5488372093023255

8539900,4,B008UTV6YM,Corey is a great instructor.  His cool relaxed manner makes it fun.  Just enough theory to boost understanding.  Breakdowns of the moves are excellent.  Never knew I could play this stuff!,1419984000,,188,4.967741935483871
8539901,5,B008UTV6YM,"Excellent content and instruction from Corey Congilio. Great camera shots of the guitar neck with a PIP showing his strumming hand. Mr Congilio breaks down the licks note for note. I was extremely impressed with the flashy Stevie Ray Vaughn riffs he breaks down. Not for beginners, but if you have the minor pentatonic scale boxes under your fingers fairly well you can navigate the material. Sure, some licks are harder than others but learning the guitar is a journey that takes time and PRACTICE. A great DVD.",1416355200,2,512,4.829545454545454

8539903,4,B008UTV6YM,"Too much talk! Frank Zappa said it best ""shut up and play your guitar"". I would have given this DVD 5 stars were it not for the fact that Corey talked sooooo much! He breaks down some great licks! Often stopping in the middle of the breakdown to talk and share information.....then he resumes the demonstration. I sometimes found it unclear where exactly he was resuming from. He starts each example with as much as one minute ( sometimes more) of dialogue. His enthusiasm is charming, but it would have been easier to learn from this dvd if he would have gone through the licks without so much commentary. I found myself constantly going back and forth between the examples at regular speed (where there was no talking) and the slower breakdown (where there was often lots talking). Sometimes it was just easier to learn from the fast example because there was no stopping, and starting, and explaining. Overall it has great licks!",1385337600,4,932,4.723926380368098
