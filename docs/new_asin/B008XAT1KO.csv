5188730,5,B008XAT1KO,I bought this double feature to get Mafia on Blu-ray.  Mafia is a very funny satire and spoof on several gangster movies. This was the last movie Lloyd Bridges made. A fun movie. The other movie was also good but not a classic like Mafia.,1365984000,,238,4.288888888888889
5188731,5,B008XAT1KO,"Mill Creek does it again, this time with two Mob themed comedies, BOTH of these are PG-13.
Both are in thier original widescreen ratios, and have optional english captions.

The PQ and AQ are great with this release.

Mafia stars Lloyd Bridges, and Christina Applegate

Thr Crew stars Burt Reynolds, Seymour Cassell, Richard Dreyfuss, and Dan Hedeya.

Mill Creek is really releasing some stellar products lately!

5188739,5,B008XAT1KO,I liked the crew and never bought the DVD so when I came across this on Blu-ray I decide to get and what a difference in sound and in the picture.,1389571200,,146,3.7419354838709675
5188740,5,B008XAT1KO,This movie was enjoyed very much.  It was like a takeoff  of the Godfather.  We laughed from beginning to end.,1381968000,,110,4.4
5188741,4,B008XAT1KO,"I'm speaking specifically to The Crew. Dreyfus, Reynolds, Cassell, and Hedaya form a quartet of hilariousness when they come together as masters of their craft. Four elderly former mobsters are being pushed out of their home in South Beach Miami, so they push back, winding in a modern day Spanish drug kingpin, a dirty cop, and all the boys from the old neighborhood. Dreyfus is the usual smooth Dreyfus running the show. Reynolds hasn't lost a millisecond of his comedic timing. Hedaya plays a goofy character, borderline crazy with a heart of gold. Cassell is the ladies man who's perpetually silent except when he needs to be.",1370131200,3,630,4.897196261682243
5188742,5,B008XAT1KO,"If you like movies like Don't Be A Menace To South Central (While Drinking your Juice in the Hood) and Scary Movie then I recommend this one is for you. I only had Mafia! on VHS not DVD. The Picture Quality is okay and the sound too is okay. I don't like is that it's a Double Feature and there no special features not even a Trailer for either movie, but for the price I can't say no. I'll never watch The Crew! Just Maifa!",1366329600,,424,4.0

8531873,4,B008XAT1KO,"""Jane Austin's Mafia!"" Is hilarious...I would have given it five stars, but many people watching it now might miss some of the more obscure references.  That said, as a fan of ""spoof"" comedies, this one is more hit than miss.",1456790400,,225,4.625
