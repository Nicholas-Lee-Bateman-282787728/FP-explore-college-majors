7988930,4,B000093NT9,"This Something Weird Video double-bill features Doctor of Doom(80mins/1962) and Wrestling Women vs. The Aztec Mummy(89mins/1964). Both movies were originally in Spanish and now dubbed in English. Both movies feature virtually the same cast with the two main lady wrestlers, the two detectives, and the one sinister bad man. Both movies also feature menacing mad doctors out to create the ultimate indestructible goofy looking 'monster thing'. Silly, spooky, and charming at the same time.

Additionally you get a bunch of extras. There are 6 trailers(Black Pit of Dr. M, Little Red Riding Hood & the Monsters, Creature of the Walking Dead, The Vampire's Coffin/The Robot vs The Aztec Mummy, Face of the Screaming Werewolf, Little Red Riding Hood). There are also 10 TV Spots(The Phantom in the Red House, The Genie of Darkness, Brainiac, The Living Head, The Invasion of the Vampires, Sampson vs The Vampire Women, The Vampire, The Witch's Mirror, The Curse of the Crying Woman, The Blood of Nostradamus). You get the demented 'echo booming' voice for each trailer.

Lastly, you get episode 3: Spiders of the monster kidie show Ghoul A-Go-Go along with the Gallery of Exploitation Art for the K Gordon Murray Collection with music by The Dead Elvi. The Ghoul episode runs 28 mins and the Murray Collection runs 16 mins. The Ghoul A-Go-Go is definately some looney material. Gotta see it to believe it. The K Gordon Murray art collection takes you back to the days of drive-in fun with those kooky movie posters. This collection is deserving of the title 'Something Weird'.",1254787200,6,1572,5.042307692307692
7988931,4,B000093NT9,"Shortly after the inception of Superman,Batman and Captain Marvel during the Golden Age of Comic Books psychologist William Moulton Marston,working under the pen name Charles Moulton,gave the world Wonder Woman,the most iconic of comic book heroines. Soon after, dozens of comic book amazons were flying through the sky and crashing through walls fighting for ""truth,justice and the American way"" just like their male counterparts. Following the lead of North American comic book publishers,Mexican motion picture producer Rene Cardona and screenwriter Alfred Salazar would create a film series that would rival the popularity of the el Santo movies...Los Luchadoras a.k.a the Wrestling Women. This dvd set from Something Weird features the first two Wrestling Women movies ""Doctor of Doom"" and ""the Wrestling Women vs. the Aztec Mummy"",starring Lorena Velazquez and Elizabeth Campbell as Gloria Venus and Golden Rubi. The plot of Doctor of Doom finds the mad scientist Dr. Ruiz performing illegal surgeries. Specifically transferring brains of animals into humans. It's up to our female tag-team champs to stop the villian. And they do with the aid of their police detective boy friends played by Armando Silvestre and Chucho Salinas. This movie also features a half man/half gorilla creature,plenty of wrestling action and cheesy dialogue. The movie's one set-back is the obvious substitution of two chunky real women wrestlers for the svelte Velazquez and Campbell whenever the action begins in earnest. The second film sees the return of Velazquez and Campbell as the Wrestling Women and the hunky Silvestre and comical(think Mexican Morey Amsterdam) Salinas as their detective boy friends. This film has the ladies going up against Asian gangsters,female judokas,and a mummy who can turn into a bat. By the way this is not the same mummy from the Aztec Mummy series starring Ramon Gay and Rosita Arenas. Both of these movies are great psychotronic fun and should not be missed. Also not to be missed are the extras on these discs. Trailers from Samson(Santo)vs. The Vampire Women and Little Red Riding Hood meet the Monsters among others.",1250899200,4,2143,5.34319526627219
7988932,2,B000093NT9,"With this double feature we do not get eggroll.  We get the first movie, DOCTOR OF DOOM, which we can skip because we only bought the DVD to watch the other movie, so intrigued were we by the title.  WRESTLING WOMEN VS THE AZTEC MUMMY is indeed better that THE ROBOT VS THE AZTEC MUMMY, which came from the same source, K. Gordon Murray dumpster diving behind the Mexican cinema lots again.  I won't get into LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD AND THE MONSTERS but if you buy this DVD you can see the trailer from it.  Only seeing is believing.

WRESTLING WOMEN actually has a few yucks going for it, and if you are into bad movies, well, you could do worse.",1168732800,6,646,4.262295081967213
7988933,4,B000093NT9,"The first of what is promised to be a release of Mexican horror films purchased from Mexico by exploitation meister K. Gordon Murray in the early Sixties.  Lots of related TV spots/trailers, with LOTS!!! OF!!! ECHO!!! ON!!! THE!!!! ANNOUNCER'S!!! VOICE!!!!  Good reading on the included eight page booklet talking about Murray's career.  Wacky gorillas!  Mad scientists!  Masked wrestlers!  Bad Twist music!  These have got it all.  But I can't wait for my two favorites, once glimpsed in a drunken state at 3:00 a.m. on a New Jersey UHF station: The Brainiac and the truly creepy Curse of The Doll People!  Cursed dolls come to life and start stabbing people to death!  THis is 30 years before ""Chucky"", remember!",1060819200,15,714,4.97457627118644
