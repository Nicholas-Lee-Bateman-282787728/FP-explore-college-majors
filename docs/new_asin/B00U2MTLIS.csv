8704011,5,B00U2MTLIS,"Coming just fifteen years or so after Wagner, Strauss was a formidable classical composer and in many ways, enigmatic. As another reviewer notes on these pages his activities or non, other than musical, in his homeland from 1933 to 1945 raise many questions. Though unlike Wagner, Strauss was not noted for expressing his societal or political views thereby concealing his true opinions about what was going on around him. Unlike Wagner he was apparently totally devoid of any flamboyance. The brilliance of his compositions, it can be said, speaks for itself. His orchestration ability and writing for the voice, especially the female, may be unequaled. However as noted by his Grandson in this presentation, it is not widely recognized that Strauss was continuously employed as a conductor, traveled regularly and conducted various orchestras an estimated 6,000 to 6,500 times during his long career. This documentary offers insight and provides visuals of this historic figure from the annals of classical music imagination.",1505347200,,1027,5.385093167701863
8704012,2,B00U2MTLIS,"This film is documentary as hagiography.  It is over directed, overacted, incoherently edited, and abysmally short on facts and any attempt at a real biography.  It relies, perhaps too heavily, on archival footage of Strauss himself, most often conducting his own music.  Some of these moments are immensely disturbing, such as his leading a performance of his bombastic, banal Olympic Hymn at the Games opening or conducting the Vienna Philharmonic in 1944 while Germany is destroying itself and a great part of the rest of the world, murdering millions.  Watching Strauss conduct this orchestra in that year, one must not ignore who has been expelled from it, why they were denied their jobs, and what music they are forbidden to play.  Yet the response to scenes such as these by the movie's commentators is mostly to shrug it off.  Strauss is never blamed for his participation in these morally heinous circumstances.

Strauss was not the worst collaborator by any means, if he was strictly speaking a collaborator at all, though one image of him with Hans Pfitzner standing at his side in the midst of other committed Nazis is hard to take.  Strauss's relationship with the Third Reich was complicated.  Yet he did take on a prominent bureaucratic role under it, one he came to find increasingly uncomfortable. The film's attitude is to render him almost entirely inculpable for these acts by either not mentioning them or mentioning them briefly and then ignoring them.  He was certainly not blameless.  No doubt his position was fraught, since he had family members to protect.  But that fact can explain or justify only so much.

The movie concentrates on only a few of his pieces, many of which come back again and again.  Most are not among his best, like the overwrought  Alpine Symphony and often kitschy Also Sprach Zarathustra.  Yet you will learn almost nothing about them.  The commentators are uniformly glib and repetitive, emphasizing mostly matters of rhythm or baton technique and so on.  The pianist in the bunch seems to be something of a Neo-Nietzschean himself, at least he makes a great deal about Strauss relationship to that philosopher.  But the same man also hears biographical matter in almost every bar Strauss wrote.  It is obvious nonsense, so overboard does he go in pursuing the analogies.  He also states, somewhat offhandedly, that because Strauss was a great family man he was a great composer.  The two, for him, apparently go hand in hand.  This is more than worshipful.  Its evocation of the doctrine of the Volk and the family at the heart of it is maddening.
Besides, one need only to counter his argument with two names, far greater composers than Strauss:  Beethoven and Brahms.

This flirting with rightwing opinions is the case with several of the other commentators as well.  Make no mistake.  Whether it means to or not, this movie has politics.  A few comments by the same Nietzsche man have an unmistakeable anti-Semitic cast to them as well.  Listen to how he emphasizes that Schoenberg was a Jew at one point and how he champions Strauss as an anti-Christ.  His interpretation of the opera Salome, though he says he is quoting Strauss, is similarly tainted.  He seems almost unaware of the implications of his way of putting things.  I'd say this was true for many of the rest as well, excluding Strauss's grandson and Fassbaender, who mostly makes scary faces and sighs in rapture.

Brigitte Fassbaender, an artist I have long admired, has become, in this film, almost a caricature of herself, mugging and wildly gesticulating.  You'd think she was performing Clytemnestra still.  The young singer she's instructing is quite good, but almost is never allowed to finish anything.  And what is the point of filming her riding on a train or in a car.  This same happens to her accompanist.  Both journeying take up a lot of useless footage.  And what are these interludes between the great retired singer and her novice student meant to be saying about Strauss, especially when no song is sung complete?  It's puzzling.

The two actors who read from letters and diaries by Strauss and his wife make you wince from their over acting and reacting.  Like everything else in the film, their segments seem to follow no chronology.  Why are they shown walking down a corridor together?  There is an enormous amount of pointless footage throughout the movie.  What they read seems to lead nowhere, to have no thematic shape to it at all, though again there is a great deal of mugging and mewing by both of them, cute little glances and looks back and forth.

And the film does not know how to end.  It returns to the beginning, the line from Strauss about how he is the end of the rainbow arcing from the Greeks to him.  But then it keeps on going.  The most poignant shot is of his wife Pauline at her husband's funeral.  That is moving to see.  But then, at the real end of the movie, the final shot is of a crucifix.  Why, when so much is made about Strauss's anti-Christian views (views that are quite well known to anyone who knows anything about Strauss at all), is this the last image we see?

All of the commendations, again excluding the grandson and Fassbaender, sound as if they had just come from some stuffy Teutonic musicological conference whose topic is that all music is finally German and only German music counts.  Strauss was the last in that great line, the end of the rainbow which began over the mountain in ancient Greece.  Strauss's beloved Greece was, of course, largely a Greece that Germans, at least since the Romantics, had made up.  It was true of Hlderlin, for example.  So it becomes Western Culture itself that is at the end of the rainbow.

This notion, Strauss's own, is nonsense, of course.  German Culture is not Western Culture and Germany art continued after the war was over.  Strauss seemed to mourn far more intensely for what he regarded as the loss of that culture than he did for the many, many millions his country's war had killed and murdered.  But, in any case, Western Culture is not German alone, Western music is not German alone, and the world of the East is not even acknowledged in such cultural solipsism, a solipsism which this film seems not just to accept but endorse.

That position is also nonsense, of course.  But it would not have sounded out of place in Germany in the thirties and forties. Neither would much of this movie.

Richard Strauss said of himself that he was not a first rate composer but a first rate second rate composer.  He wrote a lot of important music, especially many of his songs and a handful of his operas.  His late work may be, strangely, among his best and most moving, Capriccio and the Four Last Songs, for example.  I suppose it could be said that Die Frau was affected by the First World War; it makes a kind of plea for upping the birth rate.  But he was a composer as a composer mostly detached from the world around him.  He was no great thinker.  Nor was he the greatest composer of his time, a position that the film assumes, summoning Glenn Gould as its authority.  I won't make my own list.  That would serve no purpose.  But that assumption in the film underlines how hagiographic it is.  With such a complex figure as Richard Strauss, both aesthetically and ethically, that is an unhelpful attitude to take and makes this movie at times very hard to watch and listen to.",1445990400,3,7419,4.711508553654744
8704013,3,B00U2MTLIS,"Kind of a weird compilation, in my opinion.  A singer's masterclass alternating with segments of a train ride alternating with archival clips of Strauss conducting alternating with a pianist noodling away at Strauss tunes alternating with adoring commentary by musicians.  Don't get me wrong; there are a lot of interesting insights about Strauss and his times that get tossed around in this film.  But it's aggravating to have the archival clips constantly interrupted and cut off by closeups of the musicians reacting with their facial expressions to what they're seeing or hearing.  Presenting the clips in their entirety would have added so much value to this presentation, although it seems apparent that such was not the producers' intent.",1440288000,2,745,5.288135593220339
8704014,5,B00U2MTLIS,beautifully done with a sophisticated selection of quality musicians and scholars who conveyed and carried the message of the documentary very well ... very enjoyable,1439251200,,166,5.68
8704015,3,B00U2MTLIS,"Nothing new for me - not the best film about Richard Strauss...it's a movie about prople who adore this composer, nothing critical. Half of the movie is a masterclass with Brigitte Fassbender. Where are the statements of famous conductors?",1435276800,6,239,5.153846153846154
8704016,5,B00U2MTLIS,"In my favourite parts of this new Richard Strauss documentary director Eric Schulz lets his camera linger on the faces of the artists and scholars who have been interpreting the great composers life and music, as they watch, along with us, Strauss at the podium. This goes way beyond the talking heads that are a cliche of cultural documentaries. We hear amazing insights from people like pianist Stefan Mickisch, musicologist Walter Werbeck, and soprano Brigitte Fassbaender. But more importantly Schulz catches their expressions as they make new connections, thinking about Strauss as a conductor, a composer and a human being.

Schulz did the same thing in his award winning 2011 documentary Carlos Kleiber: Traces to Nowhere, which is really a splendid film. In the Strauss film he introduces some very appealing young artists: actors Henning Hartmann and Sina Reiss, who read letters by Strauss and his strong-willed wife Pauline; and soprano Emma Moore and pianist Diana Al Hassani, who participate in an amazing lesson with the great singer Brigitte Fassbaender. In speeches and letters Strauss talks about German music and art and culture, and the hope that it might someday be reborn as artists come together in a vital way. Eric Schulz demonstrates in his excellent films just such a coming together of the best and most profound ideas and experiences, in a new Germany and a new Europe.

Thanks to Schulz and his diverse cast I feel that I know much more about Strauss than I did before. Schulz is building as fine a series of classical music documentaries as the amazing early 1960s films of Ken Russell. I hope they serve as a model for future work in this genre.",1435104000,,1676,4.939716312056738
8704017,4,B00U2MTLIS,"For those looking for a biography of the well-known 20th century German composer (who if he only wrote the opening bars of Also Sprach Zarathrustra  the opening theme from the film 2001: A Space Odyssey  would be a legend), conductor and musician, I think they will be somewhat disappointed. That is not the purpose of film director Eric Schulz. But if you know Strausss best known pieces  Til Eulenspiegel, Salome, Don Juan, you will learn about his other compositions as well (he composed over 200 songs starting at the age of six (yes, you read that right  though his mother wrote the words) and continuing until a few months before his death in 1949 at age 85. And, most importantly, you will see Strauss conducting his own compositions in rare films from the late 1930s and early 1940s. The film clips are excerpts but the images are pristine as is the sound.

Tying all this together are recent interviews with music historians  most are German, with one American  who critique Strausss work. One sits at a piano and demonstrates his comments musically. Most of the dialogue is in German (only the American speaks English) but the subtitles are large and easy to read. Note that the subtitles are available in English, German, French, Spanish, Chinese and Korean!

Diorector Schulz tries to get creative by having a young man read from Strauss journal and letters while a young woman sits by his side listening. Late, the woman reads some of Strausss wifes letters while the young man listens. We are get to follow a young soprano as she goes to voice lessons and takes the train (while listening to Strauss music with headphones). Personally I found this distracting but that is subjective.

Im not a classical music expert  just a general music lover  so I did learn more about Strauss, though many of the critical commentary was beyond me. The highlight  at least for me  was the archival footage. There are no bonus features on the BD and I would have appreciated at least a few full performances as bonuses but they aren't there.

Im giving this four stars because I thought the film was not focused enough for the general viewer. But it probably would get five stars from a classical music or opera enthusiast.

The pkg includes a 16-page booklet with an index to the chapter stops and a 2  page essay  in English, German and French.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
