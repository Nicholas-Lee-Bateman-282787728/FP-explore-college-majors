8501052,5,B006MNIYFW,"I have got to say I really enjoyed this movie. A few months ago I was searching for the movie ""Detroit"" and it was not out yet so several other movies on the topic came up instead. I saved them to my list and have been watching! This is truly a compelling story. Heroin kills people, we all know that so it is uncomfortable that this group of heroin selling drug dealers are so likable, generous, and family focused. Even Tony Soprano has nothing on them, (according to them) they stayed out of the sex and violence and ran their business like any other business man running a legal business would. As someone from Detroit we are all looking to say ""nice"" things about Detroit so there is that cringe aspect to it, like this is a story about major drug dealers in  Detroit can we get a story about someone doing something good and legal?? But that thought is passing because they do put everything in context. The movie starts way back at the beginning so the viewer knows these guys did not just start selling drugs because people from Detroit sell drugs, that's what they do, it's that type of place etc.. it really gives a background into how the city started breaking down and deteriorating, the destruction of thriving black neighborhoods, it touches on all of that. Also as someone from Detroit, that Detroit feeling comes through in this movie, I do not know exactly how to put it but it's like this-- I have been mugged, then I have been mugged at gunpoint, I have had my car broken into countless times BUT I have had complete and total strangers help me out big time, stuck in the snow, one guy jumps in the driver  seat of my car and steers, the other guy pushes - and just like that, a single vulnerable woman stuck in the snow and all these guys did was help, they could have backed up and driven around me- but they didn't. I was broke down on the side of 94 @Van Dyke, I cannot tell you how many people stopped to help, some people offered to push me by hand up the on on ramp so I could get to a gas station, I couldn't let them do that. Or even just the countless people that will just start talking to you just in the name of being friendly. A story about two men who run the biggest drug operation in the city, selling the deadliest of drugs -who are loving husbands and fathers, and coach little league, and pay for their kids college in full -- that  is a real Detroit story for me.",1516579200,3,2403,4.276923076923077
