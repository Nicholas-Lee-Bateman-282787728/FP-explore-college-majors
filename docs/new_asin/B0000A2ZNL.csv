1998217,5,B0000A2ZNL,"i just want to say any one who isn't watching this show is
 missing out on an awesome show. i watch this show every week
 and even catch the repeats that are on late at night. the cast
 is very talented and i love them all. i may be a little biased,
 but i have to say george is my favorite. i have been waiting for the new fall season to begin ever since the show went off
 for the sumer. i hope this show stays on for a long time. so,
 if your not watching, i suggest you start, because your missing
 one excellent piece of television.. one more thing before i go:
 csi:miami rates right along with csi:crime scene, so i suggest
 you start watching this one as well. thanks. jackie casey",1061337600,,689,4.082089552238806

Although reluctant to watch ""another cop show"", my wife encouraged me to sit down and watch at least one episode. Needless to say, I was hooked. Everthing about the show had you glued to your seat. This is one of those rare shows that you want to stay on the air for eternity.  I'm thrilled to be able to grab this on DVD! Get it. Watch it. You'll love it!",1060819200,6,426,4.132530120481928

1998221,5,B0000A2ZNL,"This hits the ground running & never stops, building on the superb first season, character insight & chemistry goes hand in hand with great story telling, the science behind the work & actors who make this show everything it is.
Humour, emotion & great interaction & some great episodes most notibly Chaos Theory, Alter Boys, Caged & The Stalker to name but a few well worth the buy & all credit to the five main cast this is a show that sticks to the rules, gives the right amount of everything & keeps you coming back for more & the relationships between all of them just gets more complicated with each season!  Season 2 by far the best though, gut wrenching in places but all merit to Grissom, Catherine, Warrick, Nick & Sara the cast outdo themselves and no wonder this show is at the top it deserves to be!",1057449600,10,812,4.413333333333333

Thanks for getting this set out relatively soon.. still waiting on the rest of ""Once and Again"" though.. well, if you buy this you WON'T be sorry.. just guilty of intelligent entertainment that won't ever let you completely call what's going to happen in the episode.. unless it's a repeat hehe..",1056585600,4,516,4.385416666666667

1998312,5,B0000A2ZNL,"When ""CSI: Crime Scene Investigation"" Season 1 ended in May 2001, it had firmly entrenched itself as one of my all-time favorite shows. With its superb cast and intelligently written, suspenseful episodes, it was one of only a very few shows that I would make time to watch every week.

""CSI: Crime Scene Investigation"" Season 2, which premiered in September 2001, was just as strong as the inaugural season. Once again, viewers are transported to the grave shift at the Las Vegas crime lab. Gil Grissom (William Peterson) and his crack team of field investigators Catherine Willows (Marg Helgenberger), Warrick Brown (Gary Dourdan), Nick Stokes (George Eads), and Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox), tackle a series of cases that certainly challenge every one of their investigative and deductive skills. They are assisted by several ""lab rats"" - technicians who work inside the crime lab in their own specialties. Most notable among them are Greg Sanders (Eric Szmanda), the DNA technician; Archie Johnson (Archie Kao), the electronics whiz; and Bobby Dawson (Gerald McCullough), the firearms and ballistics expert. Rounding out the night shift is Captain Jim Brass (Paul Guilfoyle), a hard-boiled, cynical detective who serves as the police department's liaison with the crime lab.

""CSI: Crime Scene Investigation"" Season 2 has several notable episodes, including ""Slaves of Las Vegas,"" where Grissom and his team investigate a murder at a fetish house run by dominatrix Lady Heather; ""Identity Crisis,"" where serial killer Paul Millander returns from Season 1 and once again proves himself one of Gil Grissom's most puzzling and sinister nemeses; and ""Cross Jurisdictions,"" where the Las Vegas crime lab joins forces with the ""CSI: Miami"" team in order to investigate and solve a series of grisly murders at both locations.

These and other episodes of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation"" Season 2 continue the very high standards of excellence established in Season 1, and confirm this show as the best police procedural drama of its generation... and perhaps of all time. Highly recommended.",1436745600,,2082,5.283987915407855

1998328,3,B0000A2ZNL,"DVD review only.  I have played 4 of the 6 disc set so far.  The fourth disc had a 3/8"" scratch near edge; when first placed in player it would not load.  I took disc out and found scratch, I gently cleaned disc and tried loading it in player, disc loaded and played ok.  I tested disc after viewing all episodes a second time, it loaded ok again.  The other disc have no visible issues, I have not played disc 5 or 6 yet.  The disc holder is difficult to get disc in and out of, my opinion its a poor product design.  There are two flaps one on each side of disc set made of a stiff type of plastic.  To access the disc the two flaps have to be held open to prevent damage to disc and then the disc holder flipped to get to additional disc.  My hands are deformed from a muscle disorder so someone else may not have as much trouble with the design issue.",1433203200,,855,3.9823529411764707

Episode #209 ""And then there were none"", Jorja steals a candy bar and gives it to Catherine in a roadside store. Interesting behavior for law enforcement staff.

Although Grison says he is Catholic, he doesn't know the Bible very well.
Check out this dialogue below:
Episode #230: Minute 2:28 Grison says, ""Striking resemblance to Judas""
Brass says, ""How's that?""
Grison says, ""Both men lost their lives over a worthless bag of chips""
Correction: Mr Grisom... Judas' 'chips' were not worthless. They were 30 silver coins (Mat 27:3-10) and were later used to buy real estate...Hardly 'worthless chips'",1371945600,,650,5.065420560747664

1998409,1,B0000A2ZNL,"We saw the introduction of A/V Tech Archie Johnson played by Archie Kao in CHAOS THEORY, the constant abuse students face in high school in BULLY FOR YOU-the principal kills the bully to prevent the abused students from pulling a Columbine on the bully & on the staff who kept silent, murder by railroad, Autism & literary fraud in CAGED, the debut of Lady Heather in SLAVES OF LAS VEGAS, the return of C.S.I.'s Bonnie & Clyde(Tammy Felton & Darren Henson) in & THEN THERE WERE NONE which also served as tribute to Agatha Christie's novel of the same name, Paul Milander finally meeting his end in IDENTITY CRISIS, Nick being stalked by Nigel Crane in STALKER, Greg's first time in the field in CHASING THE BUS, the ripped from the headlines classic ANATOMY OF A LYE & the season finale THE HUNGER ARTIST.

Grissom's hearing loss, first addressed in SOUNDS OF SILENCE(1) was picked up in CHAOS THEORY & Grissom was told without surgery that he would lose all hearing in THE HUNGER ARTIST. After being held back so long from soloing in the filed, Nick finally got his own case in the B-Plot of ANATOMY OF A LYE, the romance of Sara & paramedic Hank Pettigrew was born in BULLY FOR YOU & really got going in THE FINGER, Nicole Ari Parker had a triple reunion when she guested in PRIMUM NON NOCERE reuniting with Paul Guilfoyle, her costar in EXILED:A LAW & ORDER MOVIE, Jerry Bruckheimer who produced her in REMEMBER THE TITANS & Gary Dourdan who costarred with her in the television adaptation of SOUL FOOD. Parker has lounge singer Lily Ivers romanced Warrick which ended when Warrick discovered she was a heroin addict. PRIMUM NON NOCERE was the debut episode for Jeffrey Sams as Detective Cyrus Lockwood.

Catherine's stripper past was revisited in FELONIOUS MONK which focused on the murder of her fellow friend Stephanie, Catherine also had to arrest her mentor Detective Jimmy Tadero played by Bruce McGill for tampering with the evidence so Tadero's prime suspect would be arrested & executed which allowed the real killer to remain free. FELONIOUS MONK was controversial for showcasing the mass murder of Buddhist monks on their own temple, Grissom becomes with the sole survivor & we also met David's father who serves in the Air Force, so there was character development in regard to David Phillips.

None of these storylines was touched upon, not a single episode from 2002 had commentary. The only reference to Nigel Crane since STALKER was when Grissom ordered Greg to look into Crane when Nick was kidnapped in GRAVE DANGER but STALKER had a brilliant showdown scene between George Eads & Doug Hutchison as Crane. Leland 0rser was memorable as psychic Morris Pearson. STALKER added greater depth to the Nick Stokes character & the DVD was useless in addressing this. FIREFLY did a better job in delivering a DVD & later a Blu-Ray in examining the characters & the work that went into the series. Stay tuned for Season 3.",1365724800,,2933,4.758349705304519

The one thing I appreciate the most about this series is that the case/crime is always the main story, keeping the personal affairs/story of each CSI member on the sideline and only touching it briefly. I also like how there are almost always two cases going on at the same time. There are no subtitles unfortunately, otherwise I would've given this dvd set 5-stars.",1324598400,2,541,4.645833333333333

1998429,2,B0000A2ZNL,"CSI (pick whichever spinoff you want) is a typical Hollylwood gloss over substance product. Both William Peterson and Marg Helgenberg are terrible actors - perfectly suited for the shallow scripts in shows like this. Everything is so unbelievable in this series that you may as well turn it into a cartoon (or a full-length movie, which Hollywood will undoubtedly do in a few years).

There's been very few good American crime shows - ""NYPD Blue"" and ""Monk"" (which was a comedy, but still a great show), for instance. But the newer shows are all flash and no substance.

It's funny that Americans so prefer US crime shows to their British counterparts when, if anyone would take the time to actually watch more than 15 minutes of the UK stuff they'd realize the latter are far better on the whole. Try watching ""Wire In The Blood"" or ""Rebus"" or even the older ""Inspector Morse"" and ""Cracker"" series'. I used to watch Law & Order a lot, but when I watch it now I nearly cringe. Bring back The Rockford Files!

I guess it's all down to taste (or lack thereof). Obviously not all the UK crime shows are good. ""Spooks"" is crap - probably because it tries so hard to be like the American shows. If you want a great action-packed crime show that actually has brains, check out Johan Falk (""The Bodyguards""), an excellently done Swedish show.",1312848000,,1335,4.624472573839663

We particularly like that we can watch the episodes without interruptions for ads.  The only downside to this set is the lack of subtitles.

As for Amazon's Unbox service, I've had a few problems and Amazon has been very helpful in addressing them. I wish there was a specific place just to rate the service.

No, this five-star review is mostly by way of offsetting the one-star reviews I see on the product page that were given by people who obviously didn't pay attention somewhere along the line.

Take the guy who was annoyed to discover after putting down his money that the downloads are only available to users in the United States.  That's spelled out in plain English right there on the page you see before any money changes hands.  Or the one who's complaining that the whole of season 8 isn't available.  That MIGHT have something to do with the fact that CBS hasn't finished AIRING season 8, but hey, don't go by me.

Grissom, along with his partners Catherine Willows ,Nick stokes, Warrick brown,Sara sidle, takes on difficult, gritty cases that other labs won't touch in this tight, tense crime drama that continues to push the envelope.

The episodes in this season are very original, because it's only the second season and they don't have to use some crazy idea to make the show new again. I love the episode 'Stalker' because we get to see the true companionship the CSIs have for each other.",1197158400,,693,4.9655172413793105

Everything about this series is just great..the scripts, direction, special effects (e.g. showing the trajectory of a bullet or knife), and of course the marvelous acting.  The guest stars are perfect too; usually little known actors whose anonymity makes their characters more believable.  Lots of twists and more insight into the lives of the forensics team.

1998475,5,B0000A2ZNL,"After capturing audiences' attention in 2000, CBS drama ""CSI:"" started its second season in the coveted Thursday 9pm time slot. For many hit shows, it can be difficult to keep up the momentum through a sophomore year, but this drama was different; it not only was as good as its debut season, it far surpassed any expectations, proving once more just why it remains one of the most popular - and well-done - shows out there.

If season one was about establishing the characters, the second season of ""CSI:"" was about getting under their skin, just a little. We were given a glimpse at the inner workings of these complex workaholics, through cases that not only exposed the classic CSI ""howdunit"", but the characters as well. Catherine Willows (Marg Helgenberger) became even more confident, Warrick Brown (Gary Dourdan) more intuitive, Doc Robbins (Robert David Hall) more thorough, and Greg Sanders (Eric Szmanda) even quirkier. Nick Stokes (George Eads)'s life was threatened by a stalker, Jim Brass (Paul Guilfoyle) had a run-in with his estranged daughter, and Gil Grissom (William Petersen) and Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) continued in their will-they-won't-they dance around each other.

It's obvious that the writers and actors were both more comfortable with the characters, and as a result, the episodes are tighter, with better dialogue, humor, and less exposition. Even in the midst of tragedy, we were given light-hearted moments, as the team struggled to put the puzzle pieces together to get the bad guy.

Episode highlights from season two include ""Scuba Doobie-Doo"", a so-crazy-it-has-to-be-real set of cases to keep you both intrigued and laughing; ""Slaves of Las Vegas"", which first introduced us to the dark world of Lady Heather's Dominion; ""Identity Crisis"", which wrapped up the trilogy of stories about serial murderer Paul Millander; ""Stalker"", a Hitchcock-like thriller; and ""Cross-Jurisdiction"", featuring Catherine and Warrick meeting the CSIs of Miami, who would get their own show a few months later.

The DVD set is, as always, packed full of extras, from episode commentaries, behind-the-scenes featurettes, and a special tour of the lab - after hours. With crystal-clear picture and great sound, you will be watching the world's #1 drama over and over again.",1147564800,4,2286,5.237704918032787

In one or two stories in this season the series started to wander away from the procedural viewpoint which tells the story by displaying the evidence and essentially inviting the viewer to become a part of the team. These stories were a little closer to the omniscient narrator. Fortunately there isn't a great deal of this. The viewpoint is one of the things that makes this series interesting.

Enjoyed the commentary as well. Always fun to get the inside scoop.

Once again a nit or two I found to pick-- the model turned schizo street person whose hair and clothes are a fright but her teeth look like she had just had them whitened.  Then there was the first look at CSI: Miami.  The first time a diver goes into a pond the head CSI guy of Miami holds a rifle to fend off alligators.

1998484,5,B0000A2ZNL,"It's hard not to understand the appeal of this show. I mean people have always been interested in detective/mystery/crime solving kind of stories. And this show is no exception except that the series as most people probably already know is from a forensics perspective. The show lives for the tiniest detail (hair, stain, DNA, blood, prints etc.).In short the show made forensics the new ""it"" thing on TV.

My only slight complaint in the series is that they usually have 2 stories in a single episode. It would've been better if they just focus on one story and fully explore its potential. I mean a show like Without a Trace, which based on its format seemed to be much more limited in stretching a whole story for a single episode, but they manage to utilize the whole 40 minutes in a single plot very well. Anyway that's just a minor rant because sometimes there are episodes where the story A is so good but the B story not so much, it dragged down the episode a little bit.

Some of the best episodes of Season 2 are:

-Chaos Theory (it's easier to move on when you've got someone to blame, this episode shows what happens when the crime turned out to be nobody's fault)

-Bully for You

-Slaves of Las Vegas

-Organ Grinder (watch out for Marcia Cross' pre DH guest appearance)

-You've Got Male (A great Sara episode as she relates to the female victim who seems to be as workaholic and lonely as her)

-Identity Crisis (creepy!!!)

-Stalker (one of the best episodes of the series, great script and great episode for Nick)

-Cats in the Cradle (I don't want to ruin this for you, but love the twist regarding the cat lady)

-The Hunger Artist (another series best. Well written episode)

The prosecution is merely an attorney with the skills needed to provide the facts and the law relating to the events alleged.  It is the Crime Scene Investigators (CSI), working for the local police department, that are in charge of finding the scientific data needed to prove its case.  I usually do not like crime shows.  They're usually badly done...have poor plots and uninteresting characters.  In CSI, the emphasis on speaking with the defendant(s) is downplayed.  Typically, the CSIs speak with the defendants in order to gain some knowledge on where additional evidence can be found.  The defendants are almost always respected and told that they do not have to answer if they do not wish to do so, but that the evidence will do so anyway.  I think of of the benefits of this show being on the air is that it may lessen the chance that we'll end up with a dumb OJ jury that is unable to comprehend DNA analysis.",1119312000,5,1030,4.651933701657459

Season 2 picks up just where season 1 left off, and doesn't miss a beat in terms of show or acting quality.  Every episode of this show has me glued to the screen, and it doesn't stop here either (see season 3,4, and beyond).

This show remains one of the top couple shows in the ratings, and has brought about a huge new interest in forensic science.  Colleges across the country are starting new criminal science programs or increasing their existing ones.  This show is not only incredibly interesting, but is also making an actual difference in the world.  There are few shoes on TV today that can say that.

William Petersen's acting is simply brilliant as Gil Grissim, and with marvolous support from actors and actresses like Marg Helgenberger (Catherine Willows), George Eads (Nick Stokes), Gary Dourdan (Warrick Brown), Jorja Fox (Sara Sidle), Paul Guilfoyle (Captain Jim Brass), and Eric Szmanda (Greg Sanders), the show can't (and doesn't in any way) miss.

  I'm sure the vast majority of you already know this, but there seems to be a couple of people who claim they can't find the closed captioning on the DVD. That's because you have to use the closed-captioning on your TV.It's encoded in the DVD itself,but you won't find it in the options. Just turn on the close captioning on your TV. It has long been a law that televisions manufactured for sale within the US have close-captioning ability. I'm not sure if this applies to stand-alone monitors (Ie,flatpanels,LCD's, plasma screens,etc) but unless your TV set is really,really old,it should have CC capabilities.

I love how this show shows a case and then has something personal for the characters like Nick when he said something that his babysitter did to him when he was little and Sara when she met EMT Hank for the first time. All the actors on this show make their characters so believable that it doesn't feel like you're watching a TV show and that you know them personally.

C.S.I. season two is great, but I would recommend season three more. Why? Not that season two is bad, because it is still great, but season three gives stronger shows, better plots, and more in depth character analysis.
C.S.I. season two shows more of Nick Stokes (George Eads), which I'm not sure why. Season three shows his personality to be a watered down yes man to Grissom or Warrick (depending on the day). The characters of Dr. Al Robbins (Hall), and Greg Sanders (Eric Sezmanda) become stronger. Over all, great episodes abound in both of them. Season two is better then season one. It's a natural progression for an excellent crime series on par with the ""Dragnet"" or ""Adam-12"" of the past. The character of Gil Grissom could very easily be compared to Joe Friday from Dragnet.

We're eagerly awaiting year three and hope it's as entertaining as the first two seasons.",1080172800,3,535,4.583333333333333

1998501,5,B0000A2ZNL,"We just finished disc 6 of this box set, and were absolutely blown away.  The producers of this series have definitely raised the bar, both with the dramatic and technical presentation of the second season.  Not only do the stories remain compelling (particularly good are the ""And Then There Was One,"" ""Ellie,"" ""Stalker,"" ""Anatomy of a Lye,"" and ""Felonius Monk"" episodes), the DVDs are much better for season two.  The picture quality is subtlely improved, the sound has been mastered in 5.1 surround, there are commentary tracks for selected episodes, and the special features make this even better than the first 6 discs.
If you're not familiar with the series, start with season one, and spend many compelling hours with the Las Vegas criminalistics lab.  Almost of the episodes are exceptionally well-written, an unusual feat for a weekly TV series.  The characters are evenly and consistently developed, and the series is consistently outstanding, particularly when viewed in-order and commercial-free.  I can't wait for season three to release on DVD in March!",1075852800,20,1067,5.2105263157894735
1998502,5,B0000A2ZNL,"CSI stands for Crime Scene Investigation and is about 5 investigators, a cop, a goofy lab tech and a coroner who work the graveyard shift at the Vegas Police Department. sometimes they find out who killed the vic or raped him/her, or stole something...yeah. but sometimes they don't catch them and the case files and the evidence has to go into the unsolved cases safe.
I just want to say that i LOVE CSI!!! I have the 1st season and watched it in oh...2 months...but when i got the 2nd season on DVD i watched it in only 5 days!!! 5 DAYS!!! WOW!! but seriously...CSI is the #1 most watched show in the USA, Canada, the UN and Sweeded (i think)
but anyways...the main 8 people are Jorja Fox who plays Sara Sidle, George Eads who plays Nick Stokes, Marg Helgenberger who plays the ex-stripper Catherine Willows, Gary Dourdan who plays ex-gambler Warrick Brown, Billy Petersen who plays Gil Grissom, Eric Szmanda who plays the adorable and goofy lab tech Greg Sanders, Paul Guilfoyle who plays Detective Jim Brass, and Robert David Hall who plays coroner Dr. Al Robbins.
i would recomend anyone who likes crime shows and likes to try to see if they can figure out who killed who before the cops or scientists to start watching CSI. i started watching in the middle of the 2nd season and i'm totally hooked..they are now on season 4 and i LOVE this show!!!!",1074556800,7,1354,4.55327868852459

1998509,4,B0000A2ZNL,"After the incredibly innovative first season, expectations for season II are understandably high. No disappointments here. Storylines get stronger, character nuances become second nature to the actors and we begin to feel an affinity for the characters. I'm still amazed by the excellent casting for CSI (especially in contrast to the horrible acting on CSI Miami - it's a good thing we at least now have Navy CIS to tide us over) which lends itself to some nice character development.
The DVD is an improvement over the first:
Pluses
1. 16:9 Anamorphic widescreen (finally)
2. More features than the first DVD
Minuses
1. Still no subtitles (it says closed caption - still haven't found it) again an incredible irony given the lead character's diminished hearing
2. Annoyingly slow main menu (zoom - it's a room! zoom - it's a computer! Jeez -  all I want to do is get to the episode selections)
Still it's a must have for any CSI fan. Somehow the writers always find a way to keep the storylines fresh.
5 stars for the show. 4 stars for the DVD.",1065312000,15,1046,4.684782608695652
1998510,5,B0000A2ZNL,"This has got to be the most involving and educational tv series in the history of tv.  Masterfully written and scripted, this show brings you in and makes me think that I'm working right along with these csi's even though I would probably pass out at the first sight of blood at a crime scene.  It has changed a lot of my perception and am always thinking about things like carpet fibers and prints.
The DVD series is great with exceptional picture quality and NO COMMERCIALS!!  As hard as it is,  I am going to wait and watch the 4th season when it comes out on DVD as I can't stand interruptions of such an involving show.  Some nice extras on the making of the show and they keep them short enough so that when you watch the series you still have lots of stuff left to the imagination.
So much detail in this show just sets it apart from other shows, and the producers here are putting the audience first and seem to respect their viewers.  As far as comparing season 1 and 2,  I really think that they are equally great.",1064793600,,1024,4.274611398963731
1998511,5,B0000A2ZNL,"Grissom is back with one of the nations top crime labs.  This season is even more shocking and riveting than the first.
6 discs and more special features than the first season.  This has consistently been one of the top-rated shows on television for over a year.  It mixes real technology with cutting edge crime scene investigation techniques.  They are not capable of doing everything on the show in real life but I am sure it has given them many ideas.
Each episode (crime) is based on something from the real world we are living in.  They get their ideas from real headlines and breaking news stories.  CSI is set in Las Vegas and is the direct influence on the more recent hit show, CSI Miami.  If you have never watched this show, start.  You can start by purchasing season 1 or 2.  But when you get to season 2 you will be simply amazed at what televsion has to offer these days.",1062806400,4,886,4.386503067484663
1998512,5,B0000A2ZNL,"The fantastic first season of C.S.I. was only a tease at the ingenuity and innovation to come in season two.  With bigger production values and more depth driven storylines; we see this television series entering it's prime thanks to superb performances from the ensemble cast and the ever addicting storytelling which allows the viewer to watch in awe as Grissom (William Petersen) and crew ever so dilligently discover the facts and solve the crimes, but not before a curveball or two are thrown to the viewer.  Petersen is at his best while the rest of the cast, which includes Marg Helgenberger, Jorja Fox, and Gary Dourdan amoung others, gets better and better with every next episode.  The DVD package itself is nicely put together, but a few more special features would have been nice (especially considering how Fox loads their X-Files DVD's with extras; come on Paramount how about putting some more effort into your releases?), but all together this is a solid deal.  All in all, if you've been missing out on the best prime time network drama to hit since The X-Files, I strongly suggest picking up the first season before checking this out.",1062460800,27,1152,4.862244897959184
1998513,5,B0000A2ZNL,"The second season of CSI: brought back familiar faces such as Paul Milander (my favorite episodes) and Tammy Felton.  The second season was full of great cases such as a scuba diver getting caught in a tree after a forest fire, and the Stalker episode which developed Nick's character even more.  This season gave birth to CSI: Miami in the 22nd episode.  Great Season!",1062288000,2,369,4.734375
1998514,5,B0000A2ZNL,"My local FYE usually stocks products the day they receive them, so I was able to buy this set early.  First off, I was very reluctant to watch this show at first, being such a huge fan of ER, I was not happy that CSI was stealing their ratings, but once I saw ONE episode, I was hooked... Now the DVD set...The picture and sound quality are OUTSTANDING!  The widescreen transfer truly does this landmark show justice.  Not only is the picture transfer better than the first boxed set, but the presentation is better as well...  Commentary is available on a few episodes and the featurettes are a must for fans. The special effects in this season are much better than the first and the writers seemed to have tried really hard to add comic elements in every episode.  I started by watching the season premiere and by the time I looked at the clock, I had stayed up almost all night and had already watched the first 2 discs.  From a scuba diver dead in a tree to liquid latex, this show truly kicks a$$!!!!!",1062115200,6,1006,4.381720430107527
