8187622,5,B000OYG4CA,"""Franklin's Pizza Party"" contains 5 episodes, i.e. Franklin's Picnic, Franklin's Spring First, Franklin's Interview, Franklin's Crystal, and Franklin's Advice. The stories are heartwarming and most have a lesson or message that teaches children to be well-mannered. The animation is well-done and young children will delight in the depictions of the lovable woodland creatures such as Franklin, his best friend Bear and other friends such as the smart-alecky Beaver, the humble Snail, and many more.

There are English and French language tracks, an episode index, full screen version, and a kid-friendly auto-play with a 10-second countdown to automatically play the whole program from the main menu. The running time is about 60 mins. Many of these Franklin DVDs are hard to come by, but they are worth seeking out - I have found them through third party sellers here on Amazon and also at used bookstores.",1238284800,2,908,5.2620689655172415
