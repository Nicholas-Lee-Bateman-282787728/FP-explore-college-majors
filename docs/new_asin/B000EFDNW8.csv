8108880,4,B000EFDNW8,"Rolie Polie Olie use to be on television about fifteen years ago. I don't believe it is on TV today. I use to sit with my Grandson and watch Rolie Polie Olie, his family and his dog Spot. I thought it was a very cute non-violent cartoon that taught lessons of being kind, honest, sharing, etc. My younger Grandchildren love the DVDs of Rolie Polie Olie today.",1362787200,,359,4.373134328358209
