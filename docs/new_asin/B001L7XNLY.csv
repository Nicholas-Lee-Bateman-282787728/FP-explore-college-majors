8317532,5,B001L7XNLY,"I am so frustrated by these skewed ratings involving viewing in different regions. The Amazon rating for this is 3 stars. Yet both of the people who actually reviewed Penmarric gave it 5 stars. This is because 2 people reviewed the product and one person gave it only one star in order to indicate his/her frustration about its being in Region 2 format and his not noticing that. (How is this even possible?)This is not ""reviewing"" the product. Aside from that, the product information on the site listing  is very clearly marked in three different places as Region 2 and incompatible with Region 1 players. Nevertheless, it can be viewed in Region 1 by many different means. The simplest is to get a RegionFree or All Region player. They can be bought for less than $100 and install just as easily. Though reading the directions may be even more challenging than reading the product information on an Amazon listing.",1490918400,2,917,4.767295597484277
8317533,1,B001L7XNLY,I did not realize when I ordered this that it would  not be compatible with any player that I own. When it arrived it had an obvious warning on it stating not to open it if if would not be compatible. That is when I realized that I could not play it. I wish that they made it as obvious before I ordered it. I will be returning it.,1392508800,3,331,3.7971014492753623
8317534,5,B001L7XNLY,I remember seeing the when A&E channel first started in the early 80's. I loved it then. I guess I'll have to wait for Region 1 now though.,1385510400,2,139,4.0
