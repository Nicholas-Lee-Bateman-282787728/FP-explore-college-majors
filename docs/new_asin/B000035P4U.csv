1256959,5,B000035P4U,"[A slightly modified version of this review was originally posted to the alt.tv.twin-peaks newsgroup in Feb '99 because Sheryl Lee starred as the murdered prom queen Laura Palmer in the ""Twin Peaks"" TV series  and prequel movie.]
This comedy-thriller stars Sheryl Lee, Jim Belushi,  and Kyle Chandler (from the TV show ""Inside Edition"").
It is an  absolutely wonderful film that showcases Sheryl's acting in a way that none  of her films has since ""Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me.""  Her  character, Angel, goes through a series of transformations that is  astonishing, hilarious, and touching.  If the film had gotten a major  theatrical release, it could have been the ""breakthrough"" role  that would have made a lot of critics and moviegoers recognize her real  talent.
It is also that rare thing: a funny *and* intelligent thriller  that not only shatters movie cliches, but keeps the viewer engaged for the  entire length of the movie.
School for Assassins
The story opens on the  streets of Chicago, where a businessman is being stalked by a mob hitman.  Just as he is about to strike, the hitman is run over by a truck!  We learn  that the businessman is the former accountant for the mob boss, Uncle Vinny  (Jon Polito of ""Miller's Crossing""), and he is entering the  witness protection program in order to testify against Vinny.
A new  hitman is needed pronto, and Tony Greco (Kyle Chandler), who once took a  bullet to protect another mobster, is elected.  Tony is sent to California  to train with Stevie Rosellini (Jim Belushi), the most-feared assassin in  the country. But Stevie turns out to be a laid-back California dude who  lives on the beach and quotes Nietzche, so there is plenty of humor  involving the clash between their personal styles and values.
After  training Tony for a while, Stevie reveals the final test Tony must pass  before he can return to Chicago--killing an innocent victim selected at  random from the phone book.  The victim selected is Angel Chaste (Sheryl  Lee), who turns out to be a mortician at a funeral parlor.
As Stevie and  Tony start tailing Angel, they learn that her life is a bit more  complicated that it appears.  When Angel discovers what is going on, she  uses her intelligence and wit and turns into a far more formidable target  than the assassins ever encountered.  I won't reveal any more of the plot,  as there are several delicious surprises and twists, and an ending that had  the audience cheering when I first saw it at as the opening night film for  the '99 Cinequest Film Festival.
Surprising Production Qualities
In  addition to Sheryl Lee's superb performance, Jim Belushi is dead-on in his  portrayal of Stevie. In a question and answer session after the screening,  the writer/director David Corley revealed that Belushi was his first choice  for the part, and how he fought with the producers to get Sheryl Lee for  Angel after seeing her performance in ""Backbeat.""
Corley also  told of the five-year struggle to get funding for the film, and the  reluctance of the Hollywood studios to finance a film with such a strong  and quirky female lead character.  This time allowed him to hone and  perfect the script, however, and the film is perfectly paced for its 102  minutes.  The musical score and cinematography are also impressive for a  first feature effort. Corley's prior experience was producing industrial  films for Silicon Valley companies and running a video rental store.  One  can only imagine that he watched a *lot* of videos to come up with a script  this original!
Unfortunately, the film did not acquire a US theatrical  distributor, was bought by HBO, aired a few times on cable with minimal  promotion, and was then released to video.
Don't miss this ""hidden  treasure""!",962928000,20,3762,4.877777777777778
1256960,4,B000035P4U,"James Belushi and Sheryl Lee are quite good in their roles. The movie is an action comedy, and there are a lot of funny moments. The story is funny and unpredictable in the end, James Belushi is hilarious and Sheryl Lee is  the film`s main atraction, she`s prouving here that she`s a talented  actress without taking her dress off. And the end of the film is taking you  by surprise.",962755200,2,383,4.442857142857143
1256961,5,B000035P4U,"If you have ever seen Early Edition, you will definitely love this movie.  Early Edition was a Saturday night drama starring Klye Chandler as Gary Hobson.  - A guy who gets tommorows newspaper,  today.  He used this  fortune telling information to save people's lives.  And since Klye  Chandler is such a talented actor, he transformed Gary Hobson from a  cardboard superheroe to a real human being, who people enjoyed watching for  the last four seasons.  Unfortunately this great show was cancelled at the  end of this season (2000), but you can still catch this talented Actor in  Angel's Dance.",961632000,6,598,4.929292929292929

1256991,4,B000035P4U,this movie is interesting just how it twists in the end. It is also exceedingly hard to get a hold of.,1398038400,,102,3.9047619047619047
1256992,5,B000035P4U,one of my favorite james belushi movies ever. if u like james belushi from his previous movies than u will like this one.,1385424000,,121,4.304347826086956
1256993,5,B000035P4U,THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE AND I CANNOT BELIEVE WHAT THE REATAILERS ARE CHARGING FOR IT. IT'S CALLED PRICE GOUGING. ISN'T THIS ILLEGAL? SHAME ON AMAZON FOR ALLOWING IT. I CAN AFFORD WHAT THEY ARE ASKING BUT WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN THEIR ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES. I'M GLAD I OWN IT ALREADY; I WAS GOING TO BUY IT AS A GIFT. SHAME ON YOU!!!!,1347753600,,328,4.306451612903226
1256994,5,B000035P4U,"I,ve seen this movie several times on cable, directtv and netflix. My only prolem was that I always thought it was cropped for tv, but now looking at the listing on amazon it seems as though it was shot in 1.33:1 so there is no widescreen version. That being said, I still fully intend to buy this film as it is absolutely delightful and entertaining every time I watch it Sheryl Lee, James Belushi and Kyle Chandler do a wonderful job in their parts.",1309996800,,451,4.380952380952381
1256995,5,B000035P4U,"I wish I could remember back to how we stumbled onto this little gem.  Very few people seem to know about it.  It doesn't fit neatly into any of the usual categories, being a quirky mix of action and comedy that takes it's sweet time getting going.  You get hints from the very beginning during the bowling alley sequence that this ride will be a little bit different from the usual, and it just continues to surprise when Tony discovers that the slob of a chauffeur is much more than he appears.  Not a movie for all tastes, but definitely worth watching more than once.",1292544000,,571,4.40952380952381
1256996,5,B000035P4U,"AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS MOVIE, THE FEMALE ACTRESS REALLY LOOKED  LIKE A LOSER... MAYBE ... BECAUSE SHE WAS A LOSER! SHE HAD A DEAD-END JOB, HER ONLY FAMILY MEMBER WAS DYING, ETC.
  SHE, HERSELF FELT THAT SHE WAS A MAJOR LOSER. SO MUCH IN FACT THAT SHE TRIED TO KILL HERSELF.
  BUT A TWIST OF FATE TURNS THIS ""LOSER"", INTO A POLISHED PROFESSIONAL AND PRETTY ""WINNER"". I AM NOT TELLING YOU HOW THIS HAPPENS BUT THE WAY THIS TRANSFORMATION IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE HAPPENED IS WELL-THOUGHT OUT AND BELIEVABLE.
  FOLKS, IF YOU ARE THINKING OF BUYING THIS MOVIE, LET ME TELL YOU THAT YOU WILL NOT BE DESAPOINTED. IT IS VERY ENTERTAINING, WELL ACTED, AND OVERALL A WONDEFUL MOVIE.
ENJOY!",1081209600,5,677,4.545454545454546
1256997,5,B000035P4U,The fascinating interaction of a master hit-gentleman and an unsuccessful apprentice hit-man and a self-taught very talented hit-lady. Well worth viewng more than once!,1013558400,8,168,6.041666666666667
1256998,4,B000035P4U,"Although the movie had an unremarkable start, by the time the last scene was fading from view I was wishing for more.  Sheryl Lee's performance is delightfully quirky as she transforms from reclusive bookworm and morgue attendant working the graveyard shift to...well, you'll see!  Jim Belushi, always enjoyable, plays the vegetarian uber-mechanic/guru teaching the mostly befuddled mook played engagingly by Kyle Chandler.  The state of mind I had by the end of the movie reminded me a great deal of how I felt after watching Angela Jones delicious performance in Curdled but without the excess body fluids.  Very satisfying ending!",983232000,4,633,5.3
1256999,4,B000035P4U,This movie is great.  I really enjoy watching this movie over and over again.  This makes you think while still having some action to keep anyone interested.  Overall i would recomend this movie to anyone who likes interesting endings.,975628800,3,235,4.9743589743589745

7916563,5,B000035P4U,"A rare gem, overlooked by Hollywood and largely unknown even to movie-freaks.  How did this one slip through to obscurity? Tremendous plot, hilarious tongue in cheek philosophy that winds up not being tongue in cheek.  Belushi at his best and  Sheryl Lee spanning a duality of personality that few actors could bring off under any circumstances.  Who the hell is David Corley?  Maybe we'll hear from him again someday.  If not, more's the pity.",1443657600,,444,4.9324324324324325
