8076964,5,B000AABL6C,"Great story of the ""Perfect Storm"" movie. Plenty of weather-related detail that was not provided by the movie. This is worth the purchase if you're interested in a documentary about that October's storm.",1416096000,2,203,5.181818181818182
8076965,5,B000AABL6C,Product was exactly as described and seller sent movie in timely manner.  It also arrived in perfect condition.  I would recommend this seller to everyone.  I wish there were more disaster movies/documentaries like this as I am a disaster nut,1249948800,3,242,5.0
8076966,4,B000AABL6C,"This dvd starts out with some info on the ""perfect storm"" incident in 1991 concerning the Andrea Gale fishing boat, but it is not all about this particular storm, it kind of generalizes other hurricane like storms,but seems to concentrate very much of the story on rescue missions for other smaller boats and with the ANG folks doing their thing, which is in itself, quite fascinating,and interesting, but the dvd is not entirely about that unusual phenomenan in weather that occured on 10-30-31-1991. I think they should've put more info and made more of a story about that storm than they did here.",1235606400,2,600,4.834951456310679
