4228243,4,B003YCYZAC,"The visuals through the movie are stunning and Chow Yun Fat does an incredibly convincing job of playing Confucius, who, no matter how much he was abused by his rulers, he still honored them, one of the flaws in his philosophy.

If you don't speak Mandarin and must rely on the English subtitles, be warned that most of the time the subtitles are mangled and do not stay on screen long enough to read.  The challenge is to read the subtitle while keeping an eye on the stunning visuals.

This movie is an epic equal to Cleopatra, Moses or Sparticus.  However, if you expect a potboiler, you won't get one--not all the time.  This movie was filmed for a Chinese/Asian audience and their tastes are not as shallow as what most Americans prefer so there are slow but meaningful scenes that I'm sure are there for people to actually think. I'm sure the Chinese didn't want to ruin the movie by letting Hollywood get hold of it.

The DVD I bought and watched had a photo of Confucius with a beautiful woman on the cover. They must have added her to the cover for the Western audience since she is a beauty. However, in the movie, she plays a minor role and is assassinated for being too smart and wanting too much power in a violent world dominated by men, who are busy killing each other. She doesn't have much screen time. In fact, there are not that many women in the movie.

From what I know of Confucius, the movie showed him close to who he must have been--an honorable man who wanted to bring peace to a war-torn land and end the people's suffering.  Like Moses, he spent more than a decade wondering the country in search of someone who would listen besides the rag-tag band of students who stuck to him like glue. If anything, we could learn something about dedication and loyalty from this band and their master.

I recommend this movie to anyone interested in China.",1280534400,59,1872,4.4662756598240465

4228249,5,B003YCYZAC,"I found this to be a great movie. From the start, it evokes the ancient times of constant warfare and the philosophical problems of endless social conflict he aimed at solving. The sets are perfect and the humanity and humor of the Chinese people comes through. Forget the foul caricature of the ""Christian missionaries"" that made him into some sort of a clown. He was a serious, courageous, suffering  philosopher and political adviser.  More then entertainment, it seems like a history lesson as well. Just as today, leaders didn't want to hear it.

4228277,5,B003YCYZAC,"Many in the Western world have heard the name Confucius, and have seen, heard or read at least one of his quotes of wisdom to live by. But unless you were raised in a traditional Asian home, you probably no nothing of this wonderous man's life, how he started and eventually became one of the most profound source of wisdom, good advice and trail blazer of creating communities and a society that lived in peace and harmony (well for the most part anyways.)

Within the limitations of a feature movie (considering you are covering an entire man's life in approximately 2 hours), we learn how Confucious became the most influential person we still today learn from. How he manuevered the shark infested waters of Chinese royalty and politics.

The cinematography is stunning and gorgeous, sets are accurate to the period and beautiful to behold. Costuming and cultural customs are also accurate to the Spring and Autumn periods of Chinese history. The cast is top notch, the lead a familiar face from Bullet Proof Monk and other favorites of the genre. The directing and production value are also excellent, and the story is right on course with what we know of this man's life. There are things missing, but the main thrusts and pivitol moments are there, (you just can't cover it all in 2 hours, and a mini series would not get the proper budget, directors, producers or cast to do this justice.)

Be warned though, it is...and as it should be... in Chinese (though I can't be certain if it's Mandarin or Cantonese or yet other dialects, someone more expert than I will have to post what dialect they are speaking,) but there are subtitles both for explaining where things are taking place, who the main characters are and why they are important at each instance where they make their first screen appearance, (in both Chinese and English with a pretty font that is easy to read and looks pretty with the scenery.) But i urge you strongly, to be patient and watch and read this movie, for the affect upon the viewer is as profound as Confucius himself was on the times and society he lived in. You will be glad you did.",1389571200,,2120,4.648
4228278,2,B003YCYZAC,"This is a very simplistic version of the history of Confucius. The story line is so weak it reminded me of the versions of George Washington life we were taught in grammar school.

However, I do think that the producers, etc did a good job of summarizing his overall approach - bow three times to authority.",1388534400,3,463,4.590361445783133

I don't believe that movie brought out his full acting ability and charisma and I was one of the few disapppointed in it.
Confucus is a completely different matter.
The range of acting ability, storyline and Chow Yun Fat will have you spellbound all the way to the  movie's end.
This is the movie he should be recognized for as it is in the Great List in my humble opinion.

It is also through the teaching of Confucius' principles that is strongly intertwined into Chinese tradition and belief such as one's loyalty to family, worship of ancestry, the young must respect their elders and the family as a basis for an ideal government. I am reduced to reading subtitles. There are ""double subtitles,"" too. Some subtitles are incorporated into the film that provide historical background, another set of subtitles provide dialogue translations at the very bottom of the screen, and, yes, they move a bit quickly and can appear simultaneously, so you might miss things the first time through. Fortunately, the film is worthy of multiple viewings, so don't worry about this too much.",1370736000,3,744,5.1570247933884295
4228291,1,B003YCYZAC,"There may be two movie versions. One not really a movie, but a TV video. The DVD print is soft, the dubbing terrible and every aspect of filmmaking dumbed down: Like script, direction, acting, makeup, costumes editing, and Well... EVERYTHING!

This atrocity takes my vote for the worst film to come out of China ever. Which is doubly awful because of radically-hyped 'Editorial Review'. What confuses me is that only about half customer reviews out of 35 noted all the very evident flaws. But the superlatives of the 'Editorial Review' makes me think of payoffs, politics or a sudden drop in movie standards. Viewer Emptor!

From now on I'm going to pay particular attention to one and two-star reviews.  Lower ratings seem, unless complaining about something other than film quality more coherent. Here, low-end reviews were specific and knowledgeable. I should have paid attention.

4228300,4,B003YCYZAC,"While I have always been critical of historical films I have still enjoyed them and supported many, as they are sometimes the door for a person to become familiar with an aspect of history. This might, I dare suggest, lead to reading a book. Taking on the figure of Kongzi in a biographical movie is a risk to either provide something real and accessible to viewers, or to produce a misleading bit of fantastical myth. Indeed, there was and still is much debate over this interpretation of the Master Sage. I was please to find this production firmly planted on solid reason, with only a little embellishments.
 The film focuses on what are the major events of Kongzi's life minus much of the myth surrounding him. It ignores his birth, which in some texts is straight out of Greek myth, and skips right to the well know period when he was an advisor for Duke Ding of Lu. It stays with this period of his life throughout beginning of the film, showing his successes as an advisor and how it made him enemies with the powerful family clans that mostly ran the state. The film continues after Kongzi is exiled from Lu and travels the Middle Kingdom looking for employment with his band of followers. It shows some famous meetings Kongzi had with those in power and how destitute he and his followers become traveling the countryside, as well as some of the appointments to government posts his followers win for themselves. Eventually, the film brings the story full circle only after Kongzi learns to be content with teaching and writing the now famous Annuls.
 How this film appears is quite stunning. The costumes are very well done and showing a high degree of accuracy, as well as the sets. The viewer is given a good sense of how advanced ancient China really was by the technology and the decorations shown. The importance of this is to show that Kongzi was not speaking to a world filled with people incapable of understanding him, but an educated and develop people that could weight his words and their value.
 There are many great actors in this film, especially among those that played Kongzi's followers. Ren Quan as Yan Hui is worthy of note, playing out the young man's steadfast loyalty to the Master he follows. He seems to suffer more at his Master's setbacks than Kongzi myself. Many of the actors play out emotional scenes of loss and suffering very well, tears welling up and wails of despair in the best classical Chinese cinematic tradition. However great the others are the film had to rest on one actor, and that was whoever played Kongzi. The tall frame of Chow Yun-fat held up well carrying the weight of Chinese history. He portrayed a well balanced blend of humility and knowledge throughout the movie. That might be the only real compliant, as the arrogance that a younger Kongzi was said to possess is not shown here.
 There were many doubters when his Chow was announced to play Kongzi. People felt that the native Cantonese speaker would distort the Mandarin in which he would have to speak, thus making Kongzi sound less intelligent. Not being fleunt in either of these languages I can not comment on that myself. Chow has always had presence, it is one of the things I enjoy most about his movies. I have never felt that he was an actor to play any role, but an actor to play the right roles, ones that commanded such a presence. How Chow physically plays Kongzi was one of the brighter parts of the film. His body language at the beginning of the film shows perfectly a man who is aware of his greatness trying to appeal to his lessors through humility. This changes as Kongzi matures his philosophy and himself.
 There were other concerns brought up by critics concerning Chow, tied to his action movie past. In the film there are a few action sequences. This shouldn't surprise anyone familiar with Chinese history. The times in which Kongzi lived were violent and politically chaotic. Wars, small skirmishes, displays of force, rebellions and outright conquering were all very common. Kongzi got involved in a few of these types of events as an advisor to Duke Ding, so of course this was shown in the movie. Many felt that this was lowering the imagine and story of the Sage to that of a action flick brawler. To be honest, I disagree. In the film Kongzi rarely takes direct action in the fighting, he is giving commands or in some other way witnessing the violence, not swinging his sword around. He displays talent at archery but that was something recorded in history that was attributed to him, as was his zither playing. In all I believe the critics are taking a movie too seriously. While this movie is not a history lesson it is a good place for beginners of ancient Chinese history to get an entertaining introduction to what Kongzi's life may have looked like. After this I would recommend academic level books.",1360540800,,4858,4.6573426573426575

4228306,5,B003YCYZAC,"I purchased this movie because I was interested in learning more about Confucius.  I did and it was wonderful.  You must keep in mind, watching the movie, that Confucius lived in 450 BC..BC,  The civility of the people, though it is a feudal and war-torn time, is amazing.  I knew of the formality and codes of that period, but you truly grasp the effect of them in the movie.

Cast acting and direction very good.  But the focal point is the man, his journey and the progressive impact he had on his society.

4228307,3,B003YCYZAC,"He has a bow and arrow in his hands, but no, this is not a historical action movie. Chow Yun-Fat is Confucius (551-479 BC), a Chinese politician, writer and philosopher whose eventful life story is chronicled in this so-so bio-pic that is beautiful to look at, but lacks compelling narrative.

Confucius was in the center of political intrigues in the court of the small kingdom of Lu, before enduring the long years of living in exile that started in his mid-fifties. The story, which should be dramatic and emotional with charismatic Chow Yun-Fat in the titular role, turned out disappointingly dry and unappealing due to the film's too earnest approach to the subject matter, which is like reading a beautifully printed textbook with too many footnotes.

Though Chow Yun-Fat as always delivers a solid performance as a wise philosopher and able war tactician, whose ideas often clash with the political rulers', the unfocused script does not know what to tell in the right order. There are too many characters in the film that is busy trying to include in its uneven narrative everything about the protagonist including Confucius' imaginary dialogue with Lao Tzu.

I know the film is trying to be historically accurate, but reading subtitles like - `During Ding's reign, power in the Kingdom of Lu has devolved to three aristocratic clans, known as ""The Three Noble Families"": the Jishi, Shushi and Mengshi clans' - is too much for the uninitiated in Chinese history. With gorgeous costumes and sets, ""Confucius"" is visually impressive, but the condensed and confusing storyline needs improvement.",1348358400,2,1600,5.099236641221374

4228312,4,B003YCYZAC,"""What you do not wish for yourself, do not do to others."" - The Golden Rule by Confucius

He is known as the greatest sage of all ages, the idealist and educator who was known for being one of the greatest Chinese thinkers and philosophers.

It is also through the teaching of Confucius' principles that is strongly intertwined into Chinese tradition and belief such as one's loyalty to family, worship of ancestry, the young must respect their elders and the family as a basis for an ideal government.

To commemorate the 60th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the 2,560th birthday of Confucius, a film was made to honor Confucius, also in the hopes to remind Chinese of his teaching, introduce the younger generation to Confucius as well as those around the world.

VIDEO:

""Confucius"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1 aspect ratio).  For teh most part, the picture quality is very good.  Cinematography of beautiful landscapes and costume design are expected, but there are some moments where the CG and the use of the green screen didn't seem to look natural.  Colors are saturated and there are moments where I saw some banding issues, but for the most part, the film looked good on Blu-ray.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Confucius"" is presented in Dolby TrueHD 5.1 via Mandarin and an English dub track.  The film does utilize ambience especially the sounds of arrows during the action sequences, the sound of wind during the snow storm or the crackling of ice or even the breaking down of the city walls which sounded very good.  But for the most part, the overall mix was adequate for this film.  It's not an immersive soundtrack but dialogue is crisp and clear, the musical soundtrack by Jiping Zhao was fantastic, but the film is primarily front and center channel driven.

As for the English dub, I prefer to watch Asian films in their original language but for those who are not into reading the English subtitles and prefer to listen to the English dub, the good news is FUNimation Entertainment are known for casting wonderful voice talent and the voice acting may please those who prefer in hearing the English dub.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Confucius"" was an intriguing film for me, but because I am not a Confucius erudite, I must admit, I felt a bit unsettled because I wondered how can someone with a life that has created an impact on Chinese culture, be condensed in a two hour film.

Also, because the film was made to help introduce Confucius to a new audience, a younger audience, the film could not be cerebral or too philosophical and thus the film introduced many war elements into the film.

For me, ""Confucius"" intrigued me so much that I spent hours researching his contributions to Chinese society, going through philosophy blogs that debate his book or those who support his work but also to go through criticism and praise for the film.  To find out what people liked and what made people ticked about the film.

Suffice to say, ""Confucius"" has received a lot of criticism even before the film was made into a reality.  For one, the hiring of Chow Yun-Fat (a Hong Kong Cantonese-speaking actor) instead of a mainland Chinese actor who speaks Mandarin and also the fact that Chow Yun-Fat's film career has been based on action.

Then there were rumors that drew the ire of many people.  Mainly because of the film featuring Zhou Xun's character of Nanzi and that Confucius will be having a romance with the actress in the film.  It's important to note that this never happens in the film but the rumors persisted especially due to misconceptions of the theatrical trailer that a descendent of Confucius filed a lawsuit in order to have certain scenes, especially anything intimate between Confucius and Nanzi to be removed.

And last, there were Chinese who were upset that Chinese authorities removed James Cameron's  ""Avatar"" from film theaters and replaced it with ""Confucius"" in order to prevent the sci-fi film from taking any money away from ""Confucius"".

But regardless of the criticism of the film, ""Confucius"" was going to be a film that was not going to please everyone.  As scholars and those who respect Confucius' teachings may find the film blasphemous because it does not focus on the actual idealist and educator but more of the politician and military strategist.

It is quite obvious that the writers had to make concessions in order to win over a younger audience but quite possibly an international audience.  From the hundreds of arrows being shot in the air and a brave Confucius beating on the drums as arrows come crashing all around him.  It does make for great action, but I am aware that the use of action in a film about Confucius may be disconcerting for those who want more of the intellectual side of the well-known sage.

And for a man with a long career, to fit so much into a 2-hour film, there is only so much that can be done.  I felt the writers tried to appease both sides by bringing in a plot around militaristic action and balance it with the use of philosophy and ideals without being too cerebral and I accept that.

As for Chow Yun-Fat, I felt he did a good job at playing Confucius.  And no, for those wondering if Confucius engages in any martial arts or if he fights, the answer is no.  This is a thinking man, a man who appreciates music, ethics, politics and social relationships with sincerity.

As for historical accuracy, while his teaching can be found in the ""Analects of Confucius"", there were some instances that relate to his disciples that I was checking online for hours to see if these characters actually existed and if some of their demise was factual.  I couldn't really find anything to support if the demise of disciples as shown in the movie was fiction or non-fiction but through my research, the actual events that relate to the states and the war, especially the ""meeting"" with the State of Qi and the tearing of the walls, information relating to those scenes were easily found online.

As for the Blu-ray release of ""Confucius"", the picture quality was very good but it did have some issues.  Lossless audio was appropriate for this type of film, although it would have been even better to have a bit more of an immersive soundscape during the more action-intensive scenes.  I am glad there were several special features that show the making of the film but also how passionate the writers, the crew and talent were in making this film a reality but also trying to be respectful to Confucius.

Granted, there is more to Confucius than what the writers could touch upon in 2 hours and anything delving too much into the idealist and philosophy may appeal to his followers and the intellectuals but that would have made the film too cerebral and would eventually turn off the younger viewers, especially many of its international viewers who are not too familiar with the respected philosopher.  And because of its trailer, many people would expect war and a lot of battles.

Overall, ""Confucius"" was an intriguing film that was neither great, nor was it terrible.  If anything, I was satisfied by the film to the point that it made me want to research all I can about Confucius for hours.

Prior to watching this film, I hardly knew anything about Confucius but now I find myself interested in reading the ""Analects of Confucius"" and discovering and learning more about his work.

For anyone who is curious about Confucius especially those who may be fans of Chow Yun-Fat or actress Zhou Xun, you may find ""Confucius"" to be intriguing, entertaining and a film worth their while.",1336176000,4,8733,4.78623914495658
4228313,4,B003YCYZAC,"""Confucius"" is an absolutely beautiful film...and its star...Chow Yun Fat does his usual superior work in portarying this historical character little known to most Westerners beyond a stereotypical ""Confucius Say..."" fortune cookie line. As such, it does a fine job of adding depth to his personality. That said, by trying to show so much of his life the film, at times, comes off like a Middle School educational video. Chow Yun Fat is too fine an actor to be that ""flat""...but it is a BIG story, covering many years. Discovering Chinese Cinema has been one of ther great joys of my movie-loving life...and I recommend this film to anyone interested in learning more about this supremely ethical scholar.

I think if you know a lot about Confucius it can be quite interesting but if you don't really know much about him you will still only know the tip of the ice berg after watching this movie. You definitely finish the movie wanting more. For me, I will at least be inspired enough to read some book about him. For others it may be discouraging. I think its worth seeing one time and hopefully that doesn't stop you from learning about this great man.

If the Publisher worries about which version of Chinese language to be included, please note that most Chineses can figure out from either simplified or the standard Chinese writings.  Given so many Chineses live in US, it is ridiculous that their language does not get the attention of the blu-ray movie publishers in US.  In fact, Chinese sub-title is an important language teaching instrument for Americas who are learning the Chinese language, whether they are of Chinese ethnic or not.  Since the economy is already global, Chinese sub-title will help people who need to do business travels in China / Taiwan / Singapore / Malaysia / Hong Kong!  Instead, so many blu-ray movies in US came with French and Korean, Thai, but no Chinese.  This is ridiculous and unacceptable!  In fact, I am telling all my friends NOT to buy any blu-ray movie of Chinese origin in US.  I myself rather painfully spent a lot more money to buy the Chinese movie blu-ray version in Asia.  It is very expensive over there.

4228322,4,B003YCYZAC,"I am not sure I would rank this film with Spartacus or The Ten Commandments, but it is a very good movie, well filmed, with many aesthetically pleasing scenes.  I cannot really speak about the historical accuracy of the film.  The last book I read on Confucius was in college many years ago written by Herrlee Creel (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Confucius-and-the-Chinese-Way/dp/B002GDD08I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Confucius and the Chinese Way</a>).

Unfortunately, I do not understand Chinese, so like the other reviewers, I am reduced to reading subtitles.  There are ""double subtitles,"" too.  Some subtitles are incorporated into the film that provide historical background, another set of subtitles provide  dialogue translations at the very bottom of the screen, and, yes, they move a bit quickly and can appear simultaneously, so you might miss things the first time through.  Fortunately, the film is worthy of multiple viewings, so don't worry about this too much.  The two scenes that impressed me the  most were a dialogue between Lao Tzu and Confucius, probably inspired by the Chuang Tzu, shot as a dream sequence, as the two of them probably never met and the actual existence of Lao Tzu still a subject of debate, and the death of Yan Hui, one of Confucius' favorite disciples, who loses his life trying to save books from a lake.  Both scenes have beautiful color and use light with great effect, especially Yan Hui's death scene in which the action is slowed down.  You don't have to be a book lover to appreciate his courage and nobility in trying to rescue the things of greatest importance to Confucius and his disciples.

Chow-yun Fat's performance is very human. Confucius is portrayed not as an icon, but as a multi-dimensional and somewhat complicated character who maintains his principles despite adversity.  However,I would have liked to have seen more in the way of relationship building between Confucius  and his students.  The film portrays Confucius' interaction with his students in wide bipolar swings, either aloof and restrained or deeply emotional and attached, depending on the narrative's needs.  Developing the student-teacher relationships would have provided a venue for revealing more of Confucius' philosophy, which, I am sad to say, is a little weak in its presentation.  While there is much mention of ""humanity"" and ""propriety,"" important Confucian themes, discussion of the ""Five Great Relationships,"" the character of human nature, or ""filial"" obligations seems slight and indirect.  Though these themes are well incorporated into the plot, they somewhat suffer from it, as the plot can become complicated and hard to follow demanding careful attention from the viewer.  Confucian philosophy can become secondary and obscured by the narrative.  Notably, in first half of the film, when a political triangulation and court intrigue undermine Confucius' authority and sends him into exile. Confucian ritual is portrayed, but I think its significance is lost to the Western viewer.  Consequently, Confucius, though very human, lacks intellectual depth, and a shallow sage he was not.",1293321600,19,3641,5.691312384473198

His political philosophies develop into a more general social philosophy that he teaches to a band of loyal followers. They persevere through alternating seasons of favor and disfavor with various rulers. Ultimately, his philosophies of virtue prove to have pragmatic value to the governing of cities and territories. Consequently, his followers become desireable as governmental advisors or rulers in positions of authority.

8409011,4,B003YCYZAC,"This movie attempts to present Confucius via a series of vignettes spanning much of his adult life. There is a distinct lack of flow and continuity, however, in the desire to cover such a long timeframe. The result, unfortunately, is a series of somewhat disjoint and sometimes confusing sets of events which can be hard to follow. This approach also means some characters appear and disappear from the storyline which adds to the confusion. We do not get any clear picture of the development or basis of his thinking.  It is as though the intended audience are those who are already familiar with the biography of Confucius. Chow Yun-Fat can only act inscrutable so many times before it just adds to sense of the distance from the main character. As other reviewers have noted, the English subtitles go by fast, which also adds to the challenge of watching this move.

That said, I still give it 3.5 stars, rounding up to 4. It conveys a poignancy, a sense his times and challenges, and is generally visually attractive and well-done. I think it may be better the second time around, as the choppy nature of the story will not be so jarring. Finally, Zhou Xun as the character Nanzi is absolutely amazing in her combination of intensity, subtlety and poignancy.",1485043200,3,1262,4.757990867579909
