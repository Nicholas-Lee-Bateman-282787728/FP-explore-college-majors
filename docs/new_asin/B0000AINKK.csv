7997505,5,B0000AINKK,"I own the first and the second dvd from Todd Richards. I purchased them because I'm a certified snowboard instructor with a teaching freestyle accreditation and I wanted to explore new ways to teach. I found what I wanted with these 2 DVDs. Todd is extremely thorough, he's not only a great rider but a great instructor. He's capable of breaking down every task to the basic movements and help the student achieve his/her goals. I also purchased other similar DVDs, one of which from Ross Power; Ross is an amazing rider but he has no idea how to teach, that DVD was junk as far as teaching methodology (you can be a great instructor without being the best rider, you can be the best rider without knowing how to teach, and Todd is both, great rider and great instructor!). Needless to say as far as teaching tool, T.R.'s DVDs are the best in the market; we even used them among instructor in several snowboard schools I worked at. I hope they get re-published because there's only few left and are becoming harder and harder to find. Good job Todd, give us more DVDs like these and see ya at Jackson Hole.",1148169600,2,1106,4.48019801980198

Actually I just wanted to know if anyone could tell me, when the third DVD comes out and post it here?",1084665600,,165,3.8823529411764706
7997507,5,B0000AINKK,"I just bought this dvd yesterday and what can I say, It is such a big help.  Todd really shows you how to initiate your spins lay down the grabs, as well as have fun on the hill.  It's great to see him and J2 out there showin you how to lay down the big moves like a pro.  This dvd really helped me and I can't wait to try the moves on the hill!  Everyone who wants to be a good snowboarder should buy this dvd!",1066867200,6,411,3.689655172413793
