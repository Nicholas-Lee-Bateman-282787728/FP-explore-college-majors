2698048,5,B000KWZ1PW,"Based on the delivered product I can now tell you what is in the DVD, and the news is not good.

1. A trimmed down version of the Super Bowl to the point where it seems like only highlights. Previous versions had what appeared to be the entire game. This was a huge disappointment.
2. An NFL Films retrospective of the entire Colts season. If you are not familiar with their work, NFL Films not only show key plays and make commentary, they usually get down on the field and give you an idea of the conversations going on between officials, coaches, and the players themselves.
3. A trimmed down version of the AFC Championship Game.
4. Wired segments have the on-field conversation of  Peyton Manning, Marvin Harrison, and a ""Best of Patriots/Colts"" wired segment.
5. A short piece on Media Day.
6. A behind-the-scenes look at the Super Bowl including all the preparations involved, plus the Cirque du Soleil pre-game show and the post-game show.
7. There is a profile piece on Tony Dungy and another on linebacker Gary Brackett. Both have compelling stories, and I did find these pieces interesting, just as I thought I would.
8. Two additional short pieces entitled ""Practice with Tony Dungy"" and ""Just Snap the Ball"".
9. The halftime show appears to be missing unless I've skipped over it somehow in viewing.

In summary, I just don't think the Colts got the respect they deserved based on previous Championship DVDs I have viewed that had the entire Super Bowl game including the halftime show. Last year's championship DVD in particular was excellent. I was quite upset and would change my rating from five stars to three stars if it were possible - it's not. Did we get shortchanged because the Colts weren't expected to win??? I only wish I had a more fitting tribute to the contest.",1170806400,46,1791,4.697452229299363

2698117,5,B000KWZ1PW,"This DVD is awesome! I have no clue what the beef is with the others who have reviewed this DVD. First off, it is like all the other Super Bowl Championship DVDs and does not show the Super Bowl game in its entirety. I understand how the title can be misleading but it is a summation of the entire Super Bowl championship season. Second, aside from the specific complaints like ""where is the game"" this DVD is extremely fun to watch. The full season run through makes for better viewing than just the Super Bowl. Lets be honest, this Super Bowl wasn't one of the greatest ever, to say the least, and I'm a die hard Colts fan. What is one of the best games you'll ever see is that years AFC championship between the Colts and the Patriots which is on the DVD. Thirdly, the other extra content you get in this DVD is great. Tony Dungy's coaching, Gary Brackett's story, its all good stuff. Bottom line, don't trust all these lame reviews and buy the DVD. I mean, what is it now, like $8, C'MON MAN! If you are a true Colts fan like me and want to relive this glorious moment.... and now, to relive Manning's peak with the Indianapolis Colts, you will enjoy every minute of this DVD.",1335916800,,1180,4.31981981981982
2698118,1,B000KWZ1PW,"I am very disappointed in the DVDs I purchased. 15 different supposed super bowl collection series DVDs. A series in which a different super bowl was what the cover depicts for each team. THE SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONS then it gives the number of the super bowl in roman numerals. Other have Americans game the SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONSHIP and shows the ring on the cover. Did I miss something? Would that mean the game is what the DVD is about?  Wrong the only super bowls I have received in their eternity are the two Broncos' super bowls of the Super Bowl XXXII and Super Bowl XXXIII that came along with the 1977 AFC Championship Game in a three set entitled the Broncos 3 greatest games. Said nothing about super bowl games. The only reason I knew the super bowl games were included was I had researched it on another website what I should have done for these. All very misleading. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning 13 DVD. Very disappointed.

2698147,4,B000KWZ1PW,"It's a cookie-cutter production, but the content is of the best series of events in recent sports history, so I'm giving it 4 stars. I can't wait for the sequel... next year?",1242259200,,174,4.46875
2698148,3,B000KWZ1PW,"The Indianapolis Colts, after several years of playoff frustration and high expectations, finally won a Super Bowl , Super Bowl XLI. This highlights package, which has been done annually for several years now, is not one of the better efforts by NFL Films. I am sure Indianapolis Colts fans will greatly enjoy reliving the long awaited championship season and want this as a keepsake. The regular season highlights are mostly well done, the playoff highlights are of mixed quality, while the Super Bowl highlights were very good but lacking a bit in the emotional buildup and suspense that makes these highlight packages a delight for fans. And the biggest disappointment is the package does not have the full game on it like some of the previous years. In fact, the bonus features are not that good in general. The montages that are in the bonus features are short and not very informative or revealing.

As with other DVDs in this series, the main feature is an hour or so long highlight reel of the Indianapolis Colts 2006 season, including highlights of every regular season and playoff game, with extensive highlights of the Super Bowl. The highlights, however, only do an average job of really building the suspense and emotion of the season. It simply lacked the kind of emotional drama and tension I have come to expect in these highlight packages. It also lacked very many close-up on the field shots that bring the action up close and personal as did previous videos in this series.

Another key drawback to this production is a lack of completeness obscuring the real story behind the games by leaving out key details. Generally that is a complaint you can make about all the video highlight packages like this the NFL produces. In the short time span allotted to each game, important plays and turning points are often left out. In this video, however, there is one game in particular where it leaves the viewer with a false impression of what really happened in the game, and this is the highlights of the Colts' first round playoff victory 23-8 over the Kansas City Chiefs. The story this video shows is only half correct - the Colts defense stepped up and shut down one of the most potent running attacks (and offenses) in the league, holding Kansas City running back Larry Johnson to only 32 yards rushing. On the other hand, it made the Colts offense look like it had a great game, extolling the virtues of Peyton Manning and the offense. Almost nothing was said about Manning's three interceptions and the general sloppiness and inconsistency of the offense. Yes, the key story was the Colts defense, but without pointing out the shakiness of the offense in its first 2007 playoff game it was simply an inaccurate portrayal of the game. As an historical record of the Colts run to the Super Bowl, I find this egregious.

As noted, this highlights package is average, at best, but there are some good things about it too. The opening montage has a few nicely understated interviews about the Colts heartbreaking losses in the playoffs the last three seasons, twice to the New England Patriots and last year to the Pittsburgh Steelers. The best and most revealing interview was with Jim Irsay, owner of the Colts, who said before the season (paraphrased): ""We don't want our legacy to be one of the best teams to never win a championship. Our legacy has yet to be determined."" That was a great summation of the position the Colts found themselves in in 2007.

The highlights package also does a job of chronicling the Colts mid to late season breakdown in defense, becoming the regular season team giving up the most rushing yardage, and how this could not continue in the playoffs if they expected to make a championship run. It then showed how the defense really turned it around in the playoffs shutting down some powerful running attacks, helping propel the Colts into the Super Bowl. And of course Peyton Manning is the star of the show, but kudos to the highlights package for featuring the outstanding play of the offensive line, rookie running back Joseph Addai, receivers Marvin Harrison and Reggie Wayne, tight end Dallas Clark, as well as the impact the return of safety Bob Sanders from an injury had on the defense. It was excellent in its well rounded treatment of the team when it could very well have been a Peyton Manning highlight reel given the media attention he garners.

The 29-17 Indianapolis Colts Super Bowl victory over the Chicago Bears was generally well done but lacked the same emotional drama as the rest of the highlight reel. But it did show one awesome play that this video needed more of. It showed a close up of safety Bob Sanders before the snap, then him rushing toward Cedric Benson, the Chicago running back, and making a picture perfect hit, tackle, and forced fumble. It was a beautiful play and an outstanding piece of camera work and editing. If I were a Colts fan that would have gotten me really pumped. Too bad there wasn't more of this type of action throughout.

The Bonus materials were mostly a complete waste of time. It might be the worst I've seen yet in these Super Bowl highlight packages. First, as noted earlier, it didn't have the full game broadcast on it which is a big strike against it for me. It also featured the NFL Network Postgame show which was talking heads (mostly Jim Mora, former Colts head coach) saying not much of anything, and no real analysis of the game. There is a heartwarming profile of Colts linebacker Gary Brackett who lost both his parents within four months of each other, and his brother of leukemia about a year later after he donated bone marrow to him, as well as a profile of coach Tony Dungy. There are a few wired for sound segments of Manning, Harrison, and games against the Patriots which were okay but nothing special. The two quick segments on Peyton Manning's well known antics behind the line of scrimmage before snapping the ball and how Tony Dungy runs practice were also okay but uninformative to the avid football fan. There is a more extensive highlights package of the Colts versus Patriots AFC Championship game which offers more thorough highlights of the game than appears in the main highlights package, but suffers from the same lack of game analysis and drama as the rest of the video. And of course there is the obligatory shots of a few Colts players and Tony Dungy being interviewed during Media Day, which didn't elicit much really, although the interview with defensive tackle Anthony McFarland talking about Tony Dungy's coaching style was interesting.

Finally, while I could care less about half time shows or pre-game shows, at first I was baffled that the bonus materials included the dreadful Cirque Du Soleil pre-game show, but not the Prince halftime show which I actually found entertaining. But then I realized that Prince slipped in a phallic symbol during the show (and yes I'm pretty sure he did it, and did it on purpose) and that's why it's not on the DVD.

Despite the many drawbacks, I am sure Colts fans will find this very entertaining as they relive a great, well deserved championship season. Congratulations to the Colts for a great season.

DISCLAIMER: I am an avid New England Patriots fan and this video actually made me want to puke. But it did not affect my review of the video. The fact I didn't break down in tears or break any furniture during the highlights of the AFC Championship game is evidence enough of the general lack of drama building and emotional tension of the presentation.",1237593600,,7551,4.736121673003803

2698154,1,B000KWZ1PW,"To be honest, I didn't watch the DVD.  I didn't watch it because I expected it to be a DVD of the Superbowl.  The title, ""Indianapolis Colts Championship DVD"" sort of lends itself to being exactly that.  A DVD showing the championship game.  It's not.
Also, the product description of ""reliving"" the moments was very misleading.  The best way to relive those moments is to see the game in which it was played.  This is a cheesy highlight reel of the 06-07 season.  In fact, I think that's a great name for it, as opposed to it pretending to be something it's not.",1188864000,3,563,4.407766990291262

Do not expect the Super Bowl without commercials and edited down because thats not what this is. Very disappointing. The AFC championship game of the week is just a post game show.

2698183,2,B000KWZ1PW,"I'm in the camp of most of the other reviewers here.  I'm very disappointed in this DVD package with what is essentially a 75 minute video of the Colts' Super Bowl season of which 20 minutes or so are related to their four playoff games with the Chiefs, Ravens, Pats and Bears.  It didn't even have the NFL Films Game of the Week of the Super Bowl (had to buy that one from iTunes).  The extras are nothing special other than the Game of the Week  for the win against the Pats in the AFC Championship (and that is only a 22 minute version).

I'm guessing that they wanted to get something out there ASAP after the Super Bowl and pulled things together very quickly.  Hopefully there will be a more comprehensive set (Like was done with the Steelers last year), but my hopes aren't high as I'm guessing there is a perception that sales will not be great given that Indy is a ""small market"" team.

I wish a package would come out with the complete games of all the Colts playoff games (like they have been doing with the World Series' every year).  I think there would be a demand for this product.",1173744000,18,1096,4.31219512195122

I'm more of a fan of the NFL as a whole and look forward to these releases.

The last 4 Were fantastic. The change last year from highlighting the superboswl with the whole game to the game of the week but at 44 minutes and not the current 22. The music the title music all lost and edge.

I'm assuming they'll put out a 2-3 disc set to rake in the $$.

It will be worth it for Colts fans but the only great game was the AFC championship and it should have it's own DVD hopefully someday.

Congrats Colts fans I look forward to the next 3-5 years of battle with the Pats and revenge against the Steelers.

First off, this is NOT the broadcast of Superbowl XLI. What it is, is the highlights of the entire season, game by game. The DVD chronicles the games played, the victories, the losses, the playoff games and the Superbowl. This DVD is all about the season which culminated in the championship. This is an NFL Films product and includes the cinematography and original music we've all come to expect from them.

This is the story of the whole season, one game at a time. Each game is highlighted and the heroes and acknowledged. The major actors in the season were Quarterback Peyton Manning who was the leader of the team, Coach Tony Dungy who would prove to be the first black coach to win a Superbowl and a defense that was one of the league's worst during the regular season but became a dominant defense in the post season.
