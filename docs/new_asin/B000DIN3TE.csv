8102409,5,B000DIN3TE,"This release from The Computer Group/Collegiate Images of NBC's coverage of the 1981 NCAA hoops championship between Indiana and UNC was of a very exciting game in and of itself (Indiana winning 63-50), but also had an added wrinkle that made it, at least to me, all the more appealing: the pregame show segment actually had NBC's opening to the game, with accompanying billboard.

It started with a clear, white-outlined version of the 11-feathered peacock, then a computer-animated rainbow of the peacock's colors came in from offscreen to fill in the bird. ""NBC Sports"" in ITC Serif Gothic then came in from below the peacock, leaving a rainbow trail, then the peacock's body came up from the bottom to complete the bird. As the peacock was completed, the rainbow was absorbed into the bird, and then the peacock glowed and zoomed out, where a neon-blue ""N"" flashed in behind it. The completed ""Proud N"" then went up offscreen, and the title ""National Collegiate Basketball Championship"" (also in ITC Serif Gothic, but this time in a glowing gold) zoomed out, as the screen turned to black. That title then segmented off to the left and right, as a computer-animated basketball bounced on the rainbow trail and zoomed in. A circular wipe opened up the sides of the ball to show mini-montages of tournament action and cheerleaders. The ball then lowered offscreen, and the rainbow trail disappeared. This montage is set to a marching-band soundtrack that changes keys as Dick Enberg reads the billboard.

The reason why I brought up NBC's opening and billboard as the main focus of this review is because I strongly believe that it had more life to it than today's college hoops tournament openings (the tournament now has four networks covering it: CBS, TNT, TruTV, and TBS).

In short, this is a must-purchase release of the 1981 NCAA hoops championship between Indiana and UNC, not just for the game, but for the way that NBC covered it, especially in terms of the graphics and music.",1312675200,,1989,4.878698224852071
8102410,5,B000DIN3TE,"This is an awesome dvd for any IU fan or for classic college basketball in general.  No shot clock, no three point line and a jump ball means you jump for the ball.  Now, that out of the way what can I say but how great a coach Bob Knight is.  IU was down by 8 in the first half but wound up leading by 1 point at the end of the first half on a shot by Randy Whitman.  IU would never relinquish the lead.  They came out in the second half blazing and quickly got out to a 9 point lead which they would more or less hold or add on to for the rest of the game.

The video and audio are good except for a shot time from 5:00 to 2:00 in the second half where it is obvious this portion was cobbled from a fan at home who was lucky enough to have a VCR in 1981.  You will see a stamp noting WFIE-14 Evansville Indiana and a flash of a commercial that was edited out.  At 2:00 it goes back to the original master tape.  Obviously NBC had some problems with the master at for this period which is no surprise with NBC if you have ever viewed any of their older sports presentations.  They just did not think to make any copies or take care of their tapes.  Still it looks much better than the 1975 World Series dvd I have which was also on NBC.

This dvd includes the pre-game and post-game shows and a few minutes of the end of the half-time show.  A much better presentation than the chopped up 74 minute version of the 1987 dvd which is missing some actual footage of the game as well.  It should also be noted that this game took place on March 30, 1981 which is the day President Reagan was shot and almost did not take place.  There is a touching ceremeony before the game in which the pastor from UNC leads the teams and the crowd in a prayer.  That would never fly these days.  Commentators are Dick Enberg, Billy Packer (who didn't have any hair even way back then) and the classic Al McGuire.  They do very nice job throughout the game although for the first minute or so there is no audio from their booth as there was apparently a technical glitch.  It is kind of sad to hear them mention that Landon Turner will be back next year for his senior season at IU when as most fans know he was paralyzed in a horrible car crash about 4 months after this game and would never play again.",1197158400,6,2286,4.028824833702883
8102411,5,B000DIN3TE,"Well, folks; Bob Knight is at it again! He just took a nine-loss team and turned them into champions. How does a team lose nine games during the regular season and then blow away every team in the tournament??? Well, that's exactly what this team did!!! Having Isiah Thomas and Landon Turner certainly didn't hurt! But, I think the most important person on that team was Mr. Knight. He turned those guys around and made them believe they could win. Cheers, Bob!",1195344000,,461,4.634146341463414
