256113,5,6300216055,"I saw this movie over 20 yrs ago. My wife recently purchased the video from Amazon.com and this movie was loved by my whole family. It doesn't get much better than this and the movie reminds me some of the old Walt Disney  shows several years ago on sunday nights when i was a kid. Of course, i  still think movies are no comparison to Books, but if you just look at  movies then this movie can't be beat. The boy goes to the mountains to live  off the land, learn about nature and conduct his experiments and learn  about himself. It's wonderful!",961372800,13,547,4.271844660194175
256114,4,6300216055,"As a fifth grade teacher who shows this movie to my class AFTER they read the novel, I find that they prefer the book.  Why?  There is more detail in the book, and they don't appreciate the unrealistic scene with Frightful in  the middle.  However, the movie does serve a valuable purpose, which is why  I show it each year.  We get to meet the majestic Frightful, hear her  shrill cry, appreciate her soaring beauty.  It's also interesting to see  the inside of Sam's tree, and to have a real face put to Bando.  But, for  the true experience, the book by Jean Craighead George MUST be read!!",916531200,27,593,4.398148148148148
256115,5,6300216055,"I learned about My Side of the Mountain from a friend who was reading it  because he thought it would be good, but when I got it  I thought the same  thing, but when I started I felt like if I stopped reading I'd die.  It  made me think about what I would do had it been me  running away.  END",906940800,,293,3.7049180327868854
256116,5,6300216055,"As a fifth grade teacher, I have found this book to be an excellent choice as a class novel.  Almost every young person fantasizes at some time what it would be like if he/she would strike out on his own to survive in the wilderness.  Most students, therefore, enjoy learning the numerous ways Sam, the main character, adapts to a life of self-sufficiency in a forest in the Catskill Mountains.
  Students also appreciate that the novel lends itself to ways of evaluating their comprehension beyond the typical ""quiz-discussion-book report method"" that often does little to promote a love of reading.  Our class has had fun as each student used clay, grass,leaves, rocks and sticks to build his/her own idea of how Sam's treehouse might look, as each student wrote his/her own diary in which he/she explained how he/she used some of Sam's own survival techniques to survive in a wilderness adventure, and as each student wrote and illustrated an ""ABC"" book that showed 26 important aspects of the book.
  We also really enjoyed finding the book in Amazon's website.  My students like reading other people's reviews of the book, and appreciate being able to add their own as follows: Brian Billman-I gave this book an 8 becauseI learned how to survive in  the wilderness,but there was not enough action.  Heidi Bonnes-I give this story a 3 because Ididn't like how the author jumped from time to time. I also didn't like how it was written in first person.  Kerstin Noelle Brooks-I give this book a 10 because I liked how Sam made the clothes and I also liked when he was brave enouph to fight the mother falcon. I rated it a 10 because he had interesting tools and it was interesting when he met the English teacher and didn't over-react to him. He just acted normal. My favorite part was when Sam took the falcon for a pet. You should buy this book because it's great!!I've read it 3 times!!It's great!!!I also like how he made all of stuff. My favorite part was when the skunk sprayed him. So buy that book before it's too late!!!!  Lisa Clapp-I loved MY SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN!!!  I would rate it a 10 at the least.  I liked the survival tips, how Sam got Frightful, and once it ended, I wanted more!!!  John D-I rate this book a 1.  The reason I didn't like the book was because it was in diary form.  It would have also been better if it had more excitement.  Alison F-I would givethe book an 8 because I liked Frightful. Frightful is a perigrine falcon that Sam trained. She is exciting and good at hunting.  Kristy F.-I thought this book was unrelalistic because most parents wouldn't let their child runaway.  If you ask your parents to runaway I don't think they would say you could.  Also it jumped around from thing to thing.  I rated this book 3.  I thought it was boring,too.  Laura G.-I give this story a 9 , because it has alot of survival technigues and it has very good action. I feel the book was exciting.  Janette Kielmeyer-I gave the book a 4, because I did not like the way the author jumped from time to time in the book. I did not like the fact the parents let him run away like that.  R.M  From my opinion,I Hated the book. It  would be better if it had more acition. If bando  was a robber that was wanted. by the police. Brad  Pendy I would give this book an 8 because I didn't like how it jumped from place to place. But I liked the rest of the book.  AmandaS.-I would give this book a 3. Because,it was unrealistic how the parents let Sam run away. I aslo thought that it needed more action.  John S.- I would give it a 3 because T thought that it was too long. Also seeing it through the eyes of Sam made it seem very dull. But all the survival techniques were okay.  Amber T.- I would rate it a 7. I liked the part when Sam climbs a towering cliff to claim a baby falcon, for a pet. If it had more action, I think it would have been more interesting.  Kelly W.- I would rate this book a 3 because I didn't like how he jumped from time to time. I also didn't like how he wrote in his diary so much.  Andy W -I think it was a good book because you learn  about survival in the mountains. I will read it again. I think the book was real good. I give it a 9. William White- I give it a 3 because it gave you survival techniques, but there was not much action.  Overall, it was a quality book.  Brad Christopher Williams-I would give this book an 8.  I liked the book because of the survival techniques.  I especially liked the egg boiled in a leaf.  END",881193600,5,4478,4.314970059880239

256200,1,6300216055,"Really cheesy movie. We watched the movie after reading the book for a Book Club, and the kids were really disappointed in the cinematic presentation. It's common knowledge that a movie never holds up to a book in terms of entertainment or the ability to convey the scope of the novel, but this movie only loosely followed the classic story and ***spoiler alert*** kills one of the main characters!",1513382400,,398,4.782608695652174

256252,2,6300216055,Truly disappointing. This book is one of my all time favorites from childhood and I just finished reading it with my 4 kids. I'd never known there was a movie and was excited to see that it had been done. The deviation from the book was atrocious (probably one of the worst adaptations of a book that I've seen) and ultimately for me the whole story fell flat.,1498521600,,360,4.3088235294117645

256298,1,6300216055,This doesn't even deserve to have the same title as the book.  I read this book with my son and really enjoyed it. He asked me to rent he movie so we could watch it. There was so little that followed the book it was maddening. Almost everything was changed. There was absolutely no reason to change his encounter in the woods with the woman. They could have even left it out since they changed what connected her to the story in the first place. The acting was terrible! Really the only thing this did was enforce the theory that the book is almost always better.,1490400000,,563,4.311320754716981

Thinking the movie would hold up since the story seems so clearly suited to become a screen play I was sorely disappointed at the ""poetic license"" that ruined it. Other reviewers have outlined the key plot changes that distorted the movie version of the story so I'll just concur with those people. I found it unnecessary and bothersome that the movie producer(s) felt the need to make their own bad version of a great story.",1486857600,,575,4.647058823529412

The story flows nicely and I love how the main character narrates his interactions with the animals and nature.  We learned a lot from this story and found our read to be very entertaining and rewarding.  As a celebration of our reading, we rented the movie.  The students loved comparing the two stories all the way through -- until the end.  When we got to the ending, it was unnecessarily different than the story in a way that all of us were disappointed with.

256505,4,6300216055,"This is a gem of a find. Rather weird but kind of a fun way to time-travel to the back-to-nature movement of the late Sixties and early Seventies. This was a period when Thoreau was being referenced a lot in American pop culture, and figures like naturalist Eull Gibbons were doing endorsements of Post Grape Nuts cereal by comparing it to wild hickory nuts that could be foraged in the woods. The young star is perfect, the archetypical left-brained precocious boy who has to strike out on his own to see that he can live off the land without anyone's help. The story moves along and transports those who are willing to another reality. I have to admit, though, it also provides a good backdrop when I want to take a nap...there's a certain droning monotony to the kid's narrative tone and once you see it you don't worry about missing any parts. I do recommend it, though, and it has a certain likeability that is worthwhile.",1433980800,4,927,4.5568862275449105

As a child i wanted badly to emulate this adventure, but the Angels apparently protect fools and babes.

The thing that ticked me off the most was that the ""My Side of the Mountain"" series has five books*, and in the movie: wait for it: Spoiler alert:
FRIGHTFUL, THE CHARACTER THAT CARRIES PRETTY MUCH THE REST OF THE SERIES, DIES.
And it isn't even a graceful exit. Just: majestic soaring, Sam's finally happy, the Pow! Plummet. Sob silently and fall to knees, holding dead bird body. Hunter sort of shuffles up. ""Gee, was that yer bird? Sorry."" Shuffle away. Sad music, fade to black.
What. The. Heck.
Don't watch. Get the book. The book is developed, entertaining, and educational. The movie is...the verbal equivalent of having dirty sweat socks shoved in your mouth after you ate your favorite dessert.

 as an adult. It's not bad, IMO, and I thought Ted Eccles was charming,
 although his clothes seemed impossibly clean in the wilderness.
 There is no question that the book is much better, and the movie
 is chock-full of sentimental and well-worn cliches: running away from home,
 struggling against the elements, etc. But I would argue that in the 1960's,
 anyone making a G-rated movie version of this book would not have had
 alot of options. No kid in the target demographic (urban, elementary school
 aged kids) is going to be drawn in to a movie without dialogue, conflict
 with adults/authority figures (hunters & parents), and cute furry
 creatures. Does anyone here think that kids would trade away the
 adorable raccoon for a silent movie, or even one voiced-over by Sam?",1350345600,,854,4.741496598639456

It's not AS good as the book, but the movie version of anything rarely is. It's certainly not going to compare with high-budget productions that kids are used to these days, but nevertheless, it's a good movie, with nothing 'questionable' to worry about, aside from the fact that this boy ran away from home. I'm an avid reader, but I've always tried my best to take movie adaptations as a separate entity from the books, or as a 'companion' rather than expecting faithful reenactments of my favorite books, and this one did not disappoint.

I came across the movie while browsing in the local library. As an outdoorswoman, I was interested in it. I loved it. It was one of the nicest movies I've seen in a long time. I've grown so tired of the violence, the blow-everything-up, the angst, the anger, the overdone noise and graphics of most of today's Hollywood offerings. This was such a welcome relief! The scenery was outstanding, as were the views of the wildlife. I really enjoyed the characters of Sam and Bando.

It was inaccurate and did not follow the book at all.  I would recommend the book for sure and our family really enjoyed it.  Unfortunately this movie falls short in so many ways.  It portrayed hunters as ""poachers"", it did not show living off the land as the book described.  The movie fell short in many areas and the ending was especially disappointing since in the book, Frightful--the falcon--did not die ---nor did he get killed by a bad, ugly hunter as this movie protrayed.  Whoever wrote this movie must be some environmentalist who hates hunters.  In the end of the book the character --Sam's family comes to live with him.  In this sad excuse of a movie---none of this happens.  My children who are 11 & 9 picked out several ways this movie was untrue to the book.  My son says it was painful to sit through and we all agree. It would be nice if someone would do a movie that is accurate and true to the book.  Don't waste your time with this movie.  I am so sorry that I wasted my money.  The music was terribly irritating and the fake falcon the boy was chasing was very poor quality.  Even our children picked up on how fake it was.  This is one movie we could have done without.  There ought to be a law about using the title of a really good book and destroying it by such an awful film.

There's no depth to the movie really, even Frightful's death which NEVER happened in the book, seemed to be just tacked in there to try and drive some drama home to the viewers.  Read the book, there's no reason to watch this movie other that just to see bad it is compared to the book.  Thankfully I only spent $5 on it because I found it at Walmart.  I don't mind wasting $5 on it since I knew I had to watch the movie since I love the book, but blegh, what a mess.  They even screwed up something as simple as Bando's character, having him one introduce himself as Bando, and two making him a wandering nature musician instead of a teacher...well anyway unless you find it cheap, or maybe even just rent it, I'd honestly past unless you just want to see one of the poorest book adaptations I've ever scene, it probably ranks second next to the Battlefield Earth movie.

Perhaps, had I not read any of the ""Mountain"" trilogy, I might have been more kindly disposed towards it, but I found the changes made to the story unnecessary and, in places, outright bizarre and upsetting. It contained nothing of the charm and magic of the original story.

One thing which I hear is that the young boy who portrayed Sam, Teddy Eccles, overacts. Well, it must be understood that there was no way to really teach children how to act. In a story like this, we have to believe that the boy must have boned up on living alone from not only reading Thoreau but also from trying his skills out privately. When he went out into the wild, he was prepared. All in all, this a quite a divergence from the original book but applause must go to the director who knew he had experienced people in all of the parts and thankfully stepped out of the way to just let them act. A flawed masterpice? Certainly. But at least the movie has a sympathetic (if a seemingly arrogant one) leading character in Teddy Eccles who was considered one of the better child actors of that period.

The location was moved to Quebec (no mention of grandpa's farm so Sam is clearly trespassing now), a pet raccoon named Gus was added (why?), Frightful is killed off (why? There are 2 more books in the trilogy), Sam is there with a microscope to do algae experiments (and the purpose of this is....?) and Sam learns his lesson (?) after being snowed in for 2 days and goes home at Christmas.

I was delighted to find out that one of the favorite movies from my childhood had been released on DVD. Moreover, it was a pleasant surprise that the quality of the DVD was outstanding, considering that back then (in 1972, I think), there were many technical limitations.

I am often disappointed when I ""revisit"" old movies, and compare them with today's high-tech multi-billion blockbusters. Not this time. I enjoyed ""My Side Of The Mountain"" every bit as much as I did so many years ago. And so did my kids.

In fact, I would like my kids to be as smart, tough and resourceful as Sam was in the movie.

Moreover, I believe that the new generations really need to develop a sense of harmony with nature, and some appreciation for the beauty and importance of the wilderness. May be then, it would become easier to tackle pressing issues such as global warming.

Should a movie be judged on how closely it follows the book it was inspired by? No, in my humble opinion it shouldn't. Movies and books are very different media, and therefore they abide by different criteria (for example, the movies based on ""Lord Of The Rings"" are very different from the books, yet they are worth watching).

Many kids won't be able to read the book for a number of reasons. Why not let them see the movie? The really important messages about nature, freedom, resourcefulness, and survival are all there.

We were delighted by each and every page.

Why in the world any screen write would change such a marvelous creation is beyond me! The movie wasn't even close to the novel, and we felt like it was a complete waste of time to watch. I can only wonder what the book's author must have felt watching a washed and clearly faded rendition of her creation. She must have been deeply disappointed.

The book itself would make a wonderful screenplay all its own. We truly hope that someone will resurrect the story and put it on the screen in all its glory. Until then, this movie is not it! Save your money; buy the book!!",1165881600,5,915,4.539393939393939

Turns out this film has held up well.  I'd seen it in the 80s and have always wanted to give it another go.  The material, involving a young naturalist leaving his family and big city life behind to live in the Canadian countryside, is most appealing to me.  I imagine it wouldn't be the most desirable plan to kids of today; but you never know.

I'll admit the young actor his bares a striking resembance to the ""Home Alone"" actor, but not so much as the cover suggests.  I mean, he doesn't exactly make friends with the bear either.  Just an attempt to sell it to kids.

As my memory of the movie faded, and with rereadings of the book, it became one of my favorites.  So it was with some trepidation that I put in my first copy of the VHS release of the movie.

Aside from the death of Frightful, which I must agree is perfectly gratuitous, I don't find the movie a big disappointment.  Ted Eccles, while not a particularly gifted actor, does have a certain screen presence and makes Sam a suitably sympathetic hero.  Theodore Bikkel lends magic to any role he plays, and makes a wonderfully off-center Bando.

The anti-hunting sentiments do get a bit tiresome.  The direction and cinematography are able, but not inspired.  The supporting cast contains no jarring notes, and the music, while not superb, is quite good.

Last night, I found the movie for sale at a local book/music/DVD store. I vaguely remembered that My Side of the Mountain had also been a movie way back when, but I had forgotten all about it. I bought the movie and my wife and I watched it.

Ugh. This movie was a waste of time. It was poorly written, abysmally acted, and strayed so far from the book that it was virtually unrecognizable to anyone who read and loved the book.

My wife and I got the impression that the movie was adapted by someone who doesn't like hunting or killing of animals. Reference after reference was made in the movie to guns and hunters being bad, killing animals being bad and even Frightful was killed by a hunter apparently out shooting for sport. So Sam never got his deerskin outfit (as he did in the book). Instead, he bought leather gloves and wore some kind of yellow rain slicker during the winter.

At one point near the end, when Bando returned to visit, there were so many people in Sam's hollowed out tree that I could have sworn it was a magic tree, much like the magic tents in the latest Harry Potter movie. Small from the outside. But huge on the inside.

What an awful movie. Even the cinematography was horrid. If I had to watch Frightful fly around for minutes on end one more time I might have shot her myself.

Avoid this movie at all costs!

This movie has a lot of insight into nature.
I mean no offense to other reviewers on this site, but there are a lot of negatitive reviews of this movie. I haven't read the book, but one thing I need to mention is this: I think a lot of people who read the book expect the movie to be just like the book, no more no less. Well, It's unrealistic to expect this-the movie can not be the book and the book can not be the movie-movies are different than books. You got to take what you like about the book and write the script from that. This is done all the time in Hollywood. Sometimes what works on the printed page won't work on screen and vice versa.
I like Sam's voice over in this film because it provides insights into his thoughts or what he is writing in his journal. As a bonus you'll learn a new recpe for syrrup and pancakes!

The worst change of all is the death of Sam Gribley's falcon, Frightful, by a hunter in the middle of the film.  Another big change is the addition of a pet raccoon named Gus, which also was not in the book.  The ending was a yet another disappointing change.  There were at least 25 other differences that I spotted between the book and the movie too.
As a teacher I still use this movie after my students have read the novel.  However, I use it to prove my point that the novel is usually better then the movie.  I also have my students try to find as many differences between the two as they can.
I think that an updated version of this movie, that follows the writing of Jean Craighead-George, would be big a big hit today.

Since the movie was deliberately set in Canada, with the scenery in the eastern townships of Quebec playing the starring role, I think they should have used Canadian actors, especially for the boy. He's as American as a Disney mouseketeer, with a western American twang and the brashness that only American kids of that era had. He's still effective, but seems out of place. The folk singer also was unlike a Canadian folker and wandereof that time especially. As a Canadian of the same age as the boy, I really related to the story but the people were wrong, except for the Canadian actress who realistically portrayed a typical small town librarian. Quebeckers especially would not appreciate the false and badly performed accents
of the poachers. Also, Thoreau wasn't taught in Canadian schools back then, he would not be known to a Canadian kid at all, and there's  plentiful
 Canadian rural and wilderness lore that would have been more authentic for this movie. Farley Mowat's Never Cry Wolf was a big novel at that time, for example. I liked the racoon but the name Gus is again, not Canadian.

But still, the scenery melds it all together, is the star, and conveys the idea of the movie. I thought the ending was good, the kid matures a little and
realizes it's a false dream to want to live in the wilderness alone for the rest of your life, even if it means being close to nature. He also realizes he hurt his parents. The whole running away and staying away for several months at the age of 13 requires a good dose of suspension of disbelief in the first place.",1517011200,,1772,4.63375796178344
