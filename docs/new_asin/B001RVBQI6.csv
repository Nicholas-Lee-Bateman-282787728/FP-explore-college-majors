8338994,5,B001RVBQI6,"Excellent Russian thriller. Takes place in modern day Moscow. Decent plot, fairly well twisted. However acting is simply superb, between Mashkov a Khabenski, they at a minimum should have earned an Oscar nomination for best foreign language movie in that one. Timely DVD delivery.",1323734400,,280,5.386363636363637
