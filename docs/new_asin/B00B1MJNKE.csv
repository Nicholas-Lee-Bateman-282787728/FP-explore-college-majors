5552304,4,B00B1MJNKE,"Katee Sackhoff stars as Nikki, the girl in the title. After being out of prison for four months, she gathers three of her ex-lovers in a bar. She was found not guilty of killing her stalker, then boyfriend by reason of insanity. Her criminal lawyer and now fiancee Bert (William Baldwin) shows up with her. The characters are Zach (Seth Green) her first love. There is also Miranda (Michelle Trachtenberg) and Marvin (Harold Perrineau). Each of the her three former lovers represent one aspect of the title or Nikki's psyche.

While they wait for her arrival, the three tell stories about how crazy and enchanting Nikki was in their lives. The stories barely held my interest, but I was drawn in by wanting to know where this film, with a jazz opening, was headed. The movie involves telling stories and playing head games at the table. It is more of a five man play.

The film is clever and there are times when I think it is clever for the sake of being clever. This is for those who like a smart indy and ""My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult.""

5552308,3,B00B1MJNKE,"Please note, this review contains spoilers.

Sexy Evil Genius is a dark, character-driven, comedy-thriller with a simple plot and yet complex enough to keep you on edge not knowing what will happen. It's a rare gem of a film that, even with its flaws, is well worth the time.

The story begins in a bar where businessman Zachary (SETH GREEN) is waiting at the bar for somebody when the beautiful Miranda (MICHELLE TRACHENBERG) walks in, puts a song on the jukebox, approaches and after some innocent flirtation, discover they are there to meet the same person: their ex named Nikki (KATEE SACKHOFF). Soon enough they're sitting at the table chatting about their relationships with her and also wondering why she was deliberately late, not to mention reaching out after years with minimal contact, and wanted the pair to meet and swap stories.

Sometime later, another one of Nikki's former lovers comes in, Marvin (HAROLD PERRINEAU) was in a band with Nikki and he too relays the past with the woman and comparing stories, it paints different pictures of a clearly fragmented woman. Most surprising is the possibility that she had murdered a man but found not guilty by reason of insanity, only serving three years before being released. Now she's gathered these three to a bar and has one more surprise texting she's bringing the next ""victim"" with her to this meet.

And that next victim happens to be a man named Bert (WILLIAM BALDWIN)... her attorney who helped get her off on murder charges and now the couple is engaged. After something awkward ""pleasantries"", including a nice bottle of Champaign, Nikki has an announcement that even startles her fiance: she has chosen a date for their wedding and made the proclamation in the paper which does not please Bert as if/when his law partners discover it, he could be disbarred. Now everyone at the table is in a quandary, although the three others are beginning to enjoy it a bit more seeing as Bert is a scumbag who took advantage of a client who is obviously off kilter.

However, there are more twists and turns in Nikki's possible insane, or is it insanely brilliant, plans which involves a lot of introspection as the group looks to their pasts with Nikki.

Sexy Evil Genius isn't a great movie by any stretch but it is one I can respect. For one thing, screenwriter Scott Lew wrote the film while battling ALS and for another, when you break it all down, it's a simple idea taking place in basically one central location (the bar) with a few flashback scenes. It's a low budget flick that keeps you guessing just what's up with Nikki and what her ultimate goal is at the end of the night. When it came to the screenplay and in particular the dialogue, there was something that kept nagging at me while watching. The dialogue comes across as not so much stilted but deliberate, each line or even each word specifically placed and I couldn't help but be reminded of the respected writer/director David Mamet. So if you don't like Mamet's work, the dialogue here will be a major turn off.

I also enjoyed the performances from the key cast members. Seth Green is his usual self albeit playing a low-key guy with the quirks that comes with casting someone like Green; Katee Sackhoff is wonderful in the lead role as Nikki giving a masterful and fascinating performance keeping the audience interested even when she wasn't onscreen; Michelle Trachtenberg is, as always, stunning in her role as a bisexual woman who not only shares good chemistry with Sackhoff but with Green as well (interestingly the pair missed each other on ""Buffy"" as Green left just as Trachtenberg entered the series); Perrineau provides some interesting elements with the group especially towards the end; and William Baldwin plays up the sleazy lawyer like any Baldwin could.

On a side note, keep an eye on a darkly funny cameo-like appearance from Anthony Michael Hall who has worked with director Shawn Piller on ""The Dead Zone"" television series. Until I saw the credits, I didn't recognize him.

In the end, this low budget mystery-thriller thrives on several good performances, a story that while it meanders somewhat, at least keeps the mystery up right until the end. Speaking of the ending, while I did like the final scenes, it wasn't completely satisfying. In any case, clocking in at under 90-minutes (sans credits), it is a quick film that is entertaining.

They all tell their stories about how they met, loved and ended the relationship with this woman. When she finally shows up with news that affects all of them no one is really sure how to act, or what to believe. I have to say that overall this is a pretty good movie that is worth watching but it is not for everyone. The whole movie takes place in one area and is pretty much just talking the whole time. That said the dialog is well written and the whole plot is actually interesting enough to keep you watching and interested in seeing what happens next. Trying to tell what is the truth and what is a lie also makes it that much more fun to watch. Overall, a movie that I think is fun and worth watching but is not for everyone.

5552313,3,B00B1MJNKE,"I must admit; with the likes of Michelle Trachtenberg, Katee Sackhoff, Seth Green, Harold Perrineau and Billy Baldwin, I expected this film to be considerably better.  That being said; I found the plot intriguing, the acting exquisite and the actors engaging.  The writing could have been (a lot) better - the finale a tad more climactic but I ultimately enjoyed the character interactions enough to say: I liked it.

Would I recommend this enough to spend $20?  Probably not, but when it goes down a little in price, then yes - I would recommend it.  (If only to watch Michelle, Katee, Seth, Harold and Billy interact.)

One question to anyone else who has watched ""Sexy Evil Genius"": did I hear Michelle's character; Miranda refer to Seth's character; Zachery as ""Seth"" (about 12  minutes into the film)?  And then later on when Katee's character; Nikki arrives also refer to Zachery as ""Seth""?  Or was it just me?",1365465600,2,916,4.82051282051282

5552317,4,B00B1MJNKE,"Not what I expected.  I mean, any movie with Seth Green and Katee Sackhoff in it and I will see it.  And they do not disappoint.  In fact, all of the performances were great, including the waitress (Lauren Fray).  Perhaps it's the script in general that leaves me feeling one star shy of loving it.  I say this having purchased a copy of the movie and the soundtrack; I felt like I was watching an Off-Off Broadway play that someone said ""Hey!  You should film this!""  I mean, there is even one point where Michelle Trachtenberg's character refer's to Seth Green's character as ""Seth"" instead of Zach.

All talk and nearly no action hints at it being film noir but not stylized enough to make it so.  And a minor reference to an improv troupe makes me wonder if that is where this script was started.  The beginning felt very much like a Keith Johnstone game ""I Remember When"" where the performers endow a character with a series of absurd traits before that character enters.  And then everything builds up to an end that kind of deflates everything we've just seen, making the whole piece continue to feel more like an exercise than an actual production.

Despite all of that, I still think it's a great piece that's sold more through the performances than the writing.  Although there are some great nuggets in the dialog.  I do plan to use ""Damn, I just felt that in my spine"" in conversation.",1393718400,,1397,4.536
5552318,1,B00B1MJNKE,"Oh, this is such a stinker. As this poo-filled bag lay burning on my doorstep, I had to cry a little tear for Seth Green.  He's so smart, wildly funny, and -- it turns out -- courageous to the point of recklessness where his career is concerned.  This thing is poorly conceived and just keeps getting worse with every thick second: The story is 2-dimensional and pulpy; the characters are equally flat stereotypes choking out one cliche hairball after another. The special Slugtrail Award goes to Alix Gitter whose uber-sultry bisexual seemed to be waiting for the scene reset in her low-budget porno ripoff of Vampire Academy being shot next door. (Are those her real teeth??)

As co-producer, it's obvious that Katee Sackhoff was looking for some kind of breakout vehicle. It relies entirely on that crazed, unpredictable, manically-sexual girl that seems to be the only character she can do with conviction.  I hate to say it, Katee, but she's not interesting enough to build a whole career around.  Come back to Portland, take some acting classes, do a little dinner theater.  Figure out if acting is really for you.  Because there are simply no redeeming qualities to this flick.  A bit more camp or noir and it could've been amusing.  Well, no, there's really no hope for it.  Except giving it to the Mystery Science Theater 3000 guys!  That would be perfect.",1392508800,,1365,4.815450643776824

The `action' is dialogue and suspense, and if you're looking for an action movie, this isn't it. I got hooked despite myself as the mystery around the title character unfolded, and I wound up liking it a lot more than I expected to.

5552321,5,B00B1MJNKE,"This is one of those gems that should never have gone straight to video.  In the tradition of David Mamet and the Coen Brothers, this story is compelling, well-written and keeps your attention until the end.  The performances are first rate - particularly Katie Sackhoff who is outstanding in the title role, and some superb performances from Seth Green, Michelle Trachtenberg, William Baldwin and Harold Perreneau.  The writer, Scott Lew, is an ALS patient who wrote this using a special computer virtually writing each word using a red dot on his forehead that reflects against a computer screen - which makes this movie all the more special.  Also, see the included short documentary, ""Jujitsuing Reality"", included on the DVD about Mr. Lew.  This is truly a treasure.",1386547200,,771,5.039370078740157
5552322,2,B00B1MJNKE,"Our cast of characters are exes of a woman that mysteriously invites them to a bar. They discuss and tell their stories of love gone wrong with flashback sequences, but for the most part its literally just 5 people in a bar for the entire movie. Well they do move from the bar to a table when the party gets larger. Its all dialog and backstory building to a twist ending. Its really dull stuff that could have made for a great 30 minute episode of the Twilight Zone when the talked about sexy evil genius finally walks in with her new fiance. Hey at least the movie has actors and actresses you've seen in Buffy, Family Guy, Lost, Battlestar Galactica and William Baldwin! Think of it.... seeing them for 90 minutes. One plays the evil genius, one plays a funny nerdy high school boyfriend, one plays the ex junkie lesbian ex, another plays the black ex band mate ex boyfriend, and finally one plays the new boyfriend that got the evil genius off for murder.

You learn so much about what an evil genius this character is that it seems overkill within 15 minutes and then they keep going with how evil and twisted she is. Its 80 minutes setting up the twist ending. Spare yourself this movie. 90 minutes of 5 people sitting at a table.",1385769600,2,1236,4.421052631578948

So I gave the wife a pass, and stopped it, and picked it up again in a few days while she was at work... I guess we shoulda both hung in there, because that's about when it started to get really good, and by the end... I totally loved it! I can usually guess what's gonna happen towards the end of any given flick, but this one took some great twists and turns that I never saw coming.... kudos to the writer! Good to see some Buffy alum doing something different from what we've seen of them in the past. Part of the reason I bought this was for the commentary track, all the stuff I have with Seth Green as a commentary participant is a hoot to listen to, and this is no different.

5552329,3,B00B1MJNKE,"This show is like a who-done-it in reverse. You will come to understand that the evil genius will take revenge on one or all of her former/current lovers who she brings together at a table in a bar. The crime hasn't been committed yet, you know who will do it, but you don't know when, how, or to whom. All the ex's of one woman are brought together (three men and yes, another woman) to bring this plot together in dark comedic fashion.

The first thing you need to understand about this movie is that it is dialogue driven. Almost everything takes place at a table with flashback scenes to fill in the gaps. There is not much by the way of action. However, the scenario is good enough to drive the movie and the twists are interesting. If you can't take that much reliance on dialogue to make it work for you, chances are you won't like the movie. I admit, I normally don't like this kind of movie. This one worked just well enough for me.

I can't say much more about plot without spoilers so I won't. The actors are all very recognizable and enjoyable, though not in the renaissance of their careers. I was glad to see each one. Katee Sackoff works well as the evil genius specifically because she is a bit quirky. She sells it well. I always like Seth Green. Michelle Trachtenberg is definitely on my list to see in movies as the sexy ex girlfriend of another woman. Harold Perrineau and William Baldwin round out the primary players.

I want to give a specific mention for Lauren Fray (from GREEK) though she had a very small part as the waitress. She says very little but has such an interesting manner about her that you wonder if she will play a bigger part somewhere in the story. I hope to see her in bigger movies in the future. She does off-the-wall comedy very well. Each of these actors are perfect for this type of movie and they make a success of something that could have gone very poorly. Rent if it sounds good to you.
