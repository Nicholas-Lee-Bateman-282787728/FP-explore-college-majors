7925193,4,B00004WG1I,"The other reviews spoke of the poor film quality and storyline. But I think we missed the important point, this is a story about the inner voice and focus of teenage pregnancy. These three young women are from different walks of life, faced with confusion and looking for love and understanding. This is a good film to show teenager male or female; about the pain truth after un-protected sex. The true victim is still the baby. Think about it.",1251158400,,444,4.632911392405063
7925194,5,B00004WG1I,"The ""First Rites"" video series sponsored by Hollywood Video is a terrific way for new directors to reach a wider audience. BELLYFRUIT is one of this series, and, for me, it was a highly worthwhile, empathetic film.
The stories of three young women who become pregnant not by choice but by dint of circumstances are told without sentimentalism. In their quests to find meaning and love, these young people find new life within. The outcomes of each tale are quite different--and each, again, is quite realistic.
This is not a film which provides answers, a fact which might bother some viewers. It also is not man-hating nor pro-abstinence. It is a sensitive portrait of what can and does happen in America these days. Anyone who works with teens, or who is a teen, or who is raising a teen, might gain some insights by watching this video with an open mind.
The two women responsible for this substantial work are to be congratulated on their commitment, honesty, percipience, and empathy.",1023667200,2,989,4.823529411764706

7925196,1,B00004WG1I,"It was somewhat an intesting movie. Paints a cynical picture about teenage pregnancy, and men in general. As if to say ""young ladies, don't sleep with these awefull men,... see what can happen.."". Felt like I was watching one of those contrived ""60 Minutes"", or ""20/20"" exposs. Where the presentation is directed at shock value and cynicism.  Men hating feminists, and over zelos parents will like this film..",985737600,,409,5.014705882352941
7925197,3,B00004WG1I,"Inspired by real-life stories of teen mothers living in urban Los Angeles, Bellyfruit is a fast-paced trilogy that explores how love and desperation  can come together and explode in the anguish of broken dreams and ruined  lives With a hip-hop, R&B, funk and techno-rave soundtrack, Bellyfruit  is a strikingly honest, unexpected ride through today's US youth culture.",969062400,2,369,5.43859649122807
