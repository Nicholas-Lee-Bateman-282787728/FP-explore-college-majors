7429056,3,B0155P1EDG,"At end of movie, it said that Curtis Wright (the drunk teenager) had traveled around the country and gave over 1000 talks about drunk driving, yet I can find no mention of this anywhere on the Internet.  Where's the proof of this?  Is Curtis Wright  his real name, and if not, why did he change it if he is truly sorry?  Did Curtis Wright's rich parents try to make amends by offering money or help in any way?  I've read the reviews for both the book and movie and wonder why people buy the whole story without asking these basic questions?",1461888000,,541,4.316831683168317

7429061,5,B0155P1EDG,"Honestly, this story bothered me a little bit when I heard about it in news articles. It's great that he forgave the boy but it seemed to easy. This movie is beautiful and gives so much more depth to this true story. There is background that explains a lot about this man's perspective. It also does a good job showing the balance of his struggle with pain from losing his wife and children and still being able to forgive the young man who caused the accident. This is an emotional movie and deals with some hard topics. In the end it leaves you feeling good.",1458777600,2,560,4.3428571428571425

7429067,1,B0155P1EDG,as one review said this is a back and fourth movie the whole way through.  I was lost from the start and I lost interest in watching it because I don't know what is going on.  Who was drunk?,1455148800,,190,3.8461538461538463
7429068,2,B0155P1EDG,"Very disappointed in the movie acting; too much back and forth, back and forth!  First movie came loose in case and scratched up as the middle part that holds DVD was broken.  Amazon was great in replacing it with a new one that worked.  Unfortunately, we weren't at all impressed with the movie!  Big disappointment!  Great story line; had it been done differently could have been much better!",1455062400,,394,4.735294117647059

7429070,5,B0155P1EDG,I enjoyed this movie very much.  What makes it even better is it is based on a true story.  Not everyone could forgive like this man did.  He is an inspiration to us all.,1454803200,,170,3.9411764705882355
7429071,4,B0155P1EDG,"This was a fascinating movie, although I had a hard time with some of it. I knew about the heartbreaking story and the basic details, but to see it on screen made it more real and that much more powerful. It is a life-changing story for anyone to witness, let alone live through. However, in the beginning I had a difficult time with all the switching back and forth between flashbacks and reality. Sometimes it took me awhile to figure out which time frame I was in. Then, with the movie being based on a true story, I found myself wondering through the entire movie if that was what really happened or was it artistic liberties being taken. If anything it made me want to read the book LET IT GO by Chris Williams himself. I thought the movie was very tastefully done and is an incredible example of forgiveness and letting things go that can and probably would potentially ruin us. I would recommend it to almost anyone. There are graphic images and discussions on the details of the crash that younger viewers should watch with parental guidance.",1454371200,,1050,4.560846560846561
7429072,2,B0155P1EDG,The book is much better! Chris Williams is a much different person in real life than Henry Ian Cusick portrays in this movie.  In fact I'm very surprised that Chris signed off on this because it could've been so much better with the right actor and/or director!!!!  It was hard to watch.,1454025600,,287,4.5
7429073,5,B0155P1EDG,"This movie is such a powerful reminder of the importance of forgiveness, of letting go and moving forward, and how that sets you free. It also reminds us that forgiveness is one of the most important things any of us could learn in our lives. A real tear-jerker and heart warming story.  Love this movie.  This is a MUST see movie for everyone!",1453939200,,344,4.444444444444445
7429074,5,B0155P1EDG,"I procrastinated watching this movie.  I didn't want to grieve.  I didn't want to cry.  But, I did it anyway...  What a powerful message.  You may already be familiar with the story of Chris Williams.  His story, so tragic and so poignant, is true.  One evening, while driving with his family, they were hit by a drunk driver.  Two of his children, and his wife and unborn child, were killed.  Chris and 2 sons were all that remained of his boisterous family.  The drunk driver, a 17-year-old boy named Curtis, walked away with minor injuries.  Chris spent weeks going through the motions of live and began to live through, what the physical therapist referred to as ""a year of firsts.""  As Chris began trial proceedings for the accident, the fact that Curtis was a juvenile weighed heavy on his heart.  The prosecution was pushing to have him tried as an adult and brought to justice but that would mean 30+ years in prison.  That is a long time for a young man who, according to Chris, has ""already been given a life sentence.""  In a flashback he is reminded that sometimes ""we do things in life that doesn't make sense...""  Forgiveness doesn't always make sense, but, Chris found a way to just let go...",1453939200,,1206,4.565420560747664
7429075,5,B0155P1EDG,"What a fantastic movie! Chris Williams lost his pregnant wife and two children in an auto accident caused by a drunk driver. This movie moves through the days and weeks following the accident and shows how he copes with life as a newly single father to two sons, one of them a teenager. There are some flashbacks to the accident and it wasn't a pretty scene.

He moves about in a fog most of the time, which is how I would imagine he would be. The bills are piling up and he's struggling to deal with the reality of his situation. The drunk driver (Curtis) is 17, almost 18, and there's a huge difference in punishment if he is tried as a juvenile or adult. Chris's family is pushing for him to be tried as an adult. Chris struggles with what to do and has his reasons for forgiving Curtis and wanting to help him, which are revealed towards the end.

I had a lump in my throat through most of this movie and there were times when the tears flowed. It's slow which is perfect for the type of movie it is. The acting is superb and the message is amazing. I've heard part of his story before and thought there might be more interaction with Curtis and what they have done since the accident. It doesn't go into that (there is one face to face meeting), but rather shows the importance of how forgiveness helps many people, especially the person who does the forgiving. It's a powerful message and a movie that I would recommend to everyone!

I received a DVD for an honest review.",1453766400,,1478,4.328519855595668
7429076,4,B0155P1EDG,"If you've ever been forgiven or had the opportunity to forgive, you already know the power that lies behind that act. As Christians we know that it is required of us. Christ forgave us and we are required to forgive others.

The hard part is overcoming every desire of the flesh to lash out and seek retribution. That's just where Chris Williams found himself. His whole world as he knew it had been shattered by a senseless act. Chris knew that he needed to forgive just as he had been forgiven. But all around him the cry for justice was rising up. From family, from friends, and even from circumstances such as mounting hospital bills the need to seek retribution resounded over and over again.

But a still small voice cried out, ""Let it go.""

I will admit that this story begins slow as it sets the stage for the trial. There are many flash-backs and angst ridden scenes but if you will hang with it you won't regret it. You need the background information to understand all that is going on but the real meat of the movie begins as the trial winds down. There are three pivotal points that are still resonating with me.

The first is the scene with the judge. The judge asks Chris if he believes the defendant should be tried as an adult or a juvenile. Chris speaks truth when he says that he and the defendant have already been given a life sentence no matter which way the judge decides to rule.

The second scene is the one where Chris shares with his grieving and angry sons about a past incident that changed his life and led him to his ability to forgive.

The final scene is perhaps my favorite of the three. Chris is a minister and we get to see him give a sermon talking not only about his own family but about the prodigal son and how it relates. It will forever change the way I think about that story.
I would highly recommend this movie to everyone (with the exception of small children). I believe it will help you look at the act of forgiveness as more than a requirement. It will allow you to see it as the first step in healing and becoming whole again.

I received a copy of this DVD to facilitate my review.",1453420800,4,2132,4.328320802005012
7429077,4,B0155P1EDG,"My thoughts: JUST LET GO is a powerful movie of forgiveness and of starting over. It was very sad, and I cried during one part. It was nice that the dad did have a couple kids left and that he gave his daughter's stuff away to other little girls.  Very touching. It did have some surprises, a lot of heart-rending moments, and a powerful message of forgiveness that everyone needs to see.

It's hard to rate a movie that's based on real life.  How do you judge someone's life? But the acting is good, the story well-told, and the actors seemed to play the roles well.  My family rated it somewhere between 3.5 stars and 5 stars so I'm going with 4.5.",1453334400,,650,4.30327868852459
7429078,4,B0155P1EDG,"Just Let Go is the movie based on the book by Chris Williams that tells the story of the night he lost half of his family in a tragic accident. A young 17-year-old boy was drinking and plowed into their car. The boy walked away from the accident, but Chris lost his daughter, a son, and his pregnant wife. He and his other son spent considerable time in the hospital. When the young man's trial comes, Chris must decide whether he wants to forgive and move on or go after the harshest punishment.

I haven't read the book so this review is not about how well they adapted the movie. The characters seemed to fit the people they were trying to portray and were great actors. I didn't get a sense of B actors or a second rate film at any time during the movie, which surprised me. Quite a few ""religious"" movies tend to lean in that direction. The movie used flash backs to tell the story of the wreck. This was well done and added to the drama of the plot. I'll admit to a little boredom while watching this movie. The grief portrayed was well done, but it seemed to go on and on and I prefer a little more action in my films. Overall, it was a well done story, great actors, and a beautiful message that was portrayed very well. But it wasn't my style of movie. If rating on personal preference alone it would probably be a 2.5-3 stars. But I'm giving it a 4 because I think the movie was well done and will connect with a large audience.

I received this movie free of charge in exchange for my honest review.",1453334400,,1510,4.221453287197232
7429079,5,B0155P1EDG,"You'll cry, you'll smile, you'll be so moved and touched...most importantly this film will stay with you long after it's over! The real life story of Chris Williams and the tragedy that happened to his family is one we all fear and none of us can comprehend. I read his book last fall and what a blessing it was! Through God's grace he was able to do what seemed to be the impossible. The film version of his story stays true to Chris's story and with an amazing performance by Henry Ian Cusick (LOST, The 100) along with impressive and heart moving performances from the rest of the cast, including Brenda Vaccaro and Sam Sorbo....you will walk away feeling and knowing you experienced something special and hopefully with a whole new understanding of love and forgiveness. Don't miss seeing Just Let Go!",1452902400,3,805,4.676056338028169
7429080,1,B0155P1EDG,"I read Chris Williams book ""Let it Go"" and this movie didn't follow his story! They added things that didn't happen and left out things that did. I was very disappointed! Read his book!!! It's soooooo much better!!",1452816000,2,214,4.657894736842105
7429081,5,B0155P1EDG,"Just Let Go is the story of Chris Williams, and the extraordinary way that he forgave the young man who got into a car drunk and killed Chris' pregnant wife and two of his children. Starring Henry Ian Cusick (Lost), Brenda Vaccaro, and Mitchell Ferrin, this powerful movie is tragic and uplifting at the same time. Cusick is fantastic in the role of Williams.

I can't begin to imagine the horror that Chris Williams had to live through that night, seeing his family in the car and knowing they were dead, followed by both his and his surviving son's rehabilitation (another son wasn't in the car at the time). I can imagine the immense grief and pain and anger that he must have gone through, and yet he never lost sight of the fact that the boy who hit them was just that - a boy.

Most of the movie is told through flashbacks which I think is a really smart way to tell the story, more dramatic and more meaningful as you watch his journey to forgive the boy responsible, and along the way help the boy himself to heal. Chris Williams' story is powerful, and while his book focuses more on his relationship with God and how that helped him to forgive and move forward, the movie keeps it more universal. While it definitely shows his love for God, it doesn't shove it down the viewers throat which is nice and keeps the movie appropriate for anyone no matter their beliefs. Anyone struggling to forgive someone else, or even to forgive themselves, can benefit from this movie. Highly recommend.

*I was given a copy of this DVD for review purposes.",1452816000,2,1551,4.49290780141844
7429082,4,B0155P1EDG,"I remember reading Chris Williams' book, Let it Go, and loving it when it came out a few years ago. I was really excited to get to watch this movie. I thought that for the most part it was really well done.

I thought that the characters were believable and really well cast. Henry Ian Cusick did a great job playing Chris Williams, I loved just how he seemed almost confused and living in a dream world after the accident. Like pretty much anyone would be. I also thought that the actors who played his sons did a great job.

The one thing that seemed a bit odd to me was the portrayal of Chris Williams' religion. He was the Bishop of an LDS ward at the time of the accident, and I would have thought that it would have been done more like Cokeville Miracle, where you could tell that it was LDS if you knew what you were looking for, but if you didn't it just seemed Christian. This one looks nothing like an LDS ward building, although they call him Bishop and show the Bishopric sitting on the stand. Just a little confusing.

I liked the way that the plot was done. There are lots of flashbacks of what happened in the accident. And I really liked that you don't quite no where his attitude towards the young man who killed half of his family comes from, until the very end when it's revealed.

This is one of those movies that you want to be careful showing your kids. The accident scenes are a bit graphic and there are a few mild swear words. It's PG-13 and there's a reason for that!

This is a great movie about forgiveness and isn't that really something that each and everyone of us needs in our lives everyday in one way or another?",1452643200,2,1646,4.246006389776358
7429083,5,B0155P1EDG,I saw this at the movie theater and was extremely impressed with story.  This man's family wanted the driver to have the book thrown at him.  The father had compassion on the young man that was a drunk driver.  Near the end he explains to his sons of someone forgiving him and how it impacted him.  This is a true story and really pulls at heart strings.,1452470400,3,354,4.2388059701492535
