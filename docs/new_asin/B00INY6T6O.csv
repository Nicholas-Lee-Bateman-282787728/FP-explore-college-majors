8643756,4,B00INY6T6O,"If - assuming you're a man - this film doesn't make you completely gay for Luis Tosar and his crazy talent, then I would question your manhood...and possibly if you're still living.

Forget the 'Lolita' angle, this is a moving, funny, and profound film about how easy it is for our lives to disappoint, regardless of the plans of youth.

Having said that, the relationship between Pablo and Maria is deftly handled, though the ending is wrapped up a little too quickly to completely satisfy. And a big shout out to Nathalie Poza, for a beautifully stated performance as Eva, who is as lost as Pablo.",1302393600,3,599,4.6415094339622645
