8344577,4,B001UNVDY8,"You're not getting it Amazon!  All novelas star a woman first.  Victoria Ruffo is the star of this novela and Arturo Peniche is not even her love interest.  He is the bad guy.  Victoria Ruffo is an international superstar!  This is like you saying that Steve Martin is the star of ""It's Complicated"" and you forget to mention Meryl Streep.  Please get a clue.  People are searching for Victoria Ruffo, not Peniche.",1372550400,,414,4.666666666666667

It's okay if not.

Please let me know.  thanks,
