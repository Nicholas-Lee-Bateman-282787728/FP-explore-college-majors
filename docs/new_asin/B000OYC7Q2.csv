They have absolutely the worst customer service I have dealt with. This DVD does not work on most US DVD players- there are region limitations. This was not mentioned anywhere (probably should be) so when I received the DVD I was extremely disappointed to find out I couldn't watch it. And I was really looking forward to it b/c I am a HUGE Ricky Gervais fan. So after complaining to Caiman, I got authorized to return it, which I did, and they did not crdt me for the $90 DVD. I can't really blame this on Amazon- I have always had great service from them. I'm just extremely disappointed and would never purchase from Caiman again.",1205712000,9,799,4.405405405405405

2803259,2,B000OYC7Q2,"Karl and Warrick genuinely dislike each other.  It's not like Ricky & Karl's irritable relationship where there is underlying affection.  This pairing brought out the worst in Karl, he's more unpleasant than sardonic.

I think the reason the series is so short is that all realized it wasn't working so they wrapped-up early.",1398470400,6,325,5.09433962264151

2803286,1,B000OYC7Q2,"The show's chemistry was altered 180 degrees when Warrick was added. Warrick is too deep, too reflective, and too intelligent to be a part of this. He defuses Karl's frustration before it ever comes to fruition. Gervais should go with Karl if there ever is a next season, or somehow get Karl to go out on his own again. Send him out into the world to peddle his pant invention or something. Like a door-to-door salesman except on a global scale. GET KARL BACK OUT THERE BY HIMSELF!",1385769600,5,481,4.4772727272727275

2803289,5,B000OYC7Q2,"Pilkingtonian. If you're familiar with ""The Ricky Gervais show"" or previous seasons of An Idiot Abroad, you know what you're getting. Karl consistently blows my mind with his simple, yet often times insightful world view. Note that this season is shorter than the previous two (as is his traveling companion, Warrick Davis). Warrick's sunny demeanor only serves to show what a curmudgeon Captain BS is",1380240000,,401,5.184615384615385
2803290,3,B000OYC7Q2,"Karl is great but Warwick isn't as funny.
There are some great moments and I would recommend it.
Not as genuine as solo Karl but still funny.
The Italian pleasure booth is hilarious.
If you're a fan of Karl it won't disappoint.",1378512000,3,227,4.428571428571429
2803320,5,B000OYC7Q2,"Ricky Gervais remains a genius, Karl remains his idiot savant, and possibly the most loveable non-celebrity on the planet, and Warwick was the perfect person to add to the mix. Karl had misgivings about having this travel partner, and so did I, but I would follow Gervais anywhere, his instincts are so good.",1378512000,2,308,4.830188679245283
2803321,4,B000OYC7Q2,"Karl really comes across as even more clueless and rude than in the previous seasons.  I do not know what kept Warwick from punching Karl. As usual Karl is usual his whining complaining self.  But it is still a funny concept, a travel show about someone who does not want to travel.  Karl is particularly upset that Warwick treats the trip like a holiday/vacation.  Warwick gives Karl more fodder for moaning and whining in phone calls to Ricky which only make Ricky howl with laughter.  If you a fan of this round headed buffoon you will want to watch this series.",1377561600,,565,4.554455445544554
2803322,5,B000OYC7Q2,The conflicting personalities of Warwick Davis and Karl Pilkington make for big laughs.  My one complaint is that it is shorter than the two previous seasons.,1374796800,,158,5.076923076923077
2803323,5,B000OYC7Q2,I love this show in general!  Karl cracks me up! Warwick Davis was a great sport!  I would actually travel with Karl just to experience his personality in person!,1374537600,,162,4.551724137931035
2803324,5,B000OYC7Q2,"I am a huge Ricky Gervais fan. If you liked Idiot Abroad 1 and 2, you will love season 3. Karl continues to make hilarious and ridiculous comments. Warwick is the perfect match for this series.",1374105600,,193,4.388888888888889
2803325,5,B000OYC7Q2,"Admittedly this series is shorter than the previous two, only weighing in with 3 real episodes, however that shouldn't deter anyone from taking the time to enjoy the third incarnation of an Idiot Abroad.

Ironically in this series it seems that Karl has managed to figure out that his mates aren't out there to make his life more fun or even do things that he wants during the excursions and has accepted his fate as a simple object for our amusement.  This does reduce the amount of traditional 'belly aching' from Karl and seems to honestly open his eyes a bit more to the things he is experiencing in a way more fitting to how you or I would.  I found myself thinking ""Hrm, thats more how I'd react to that."" far more often in series 3 than the previous series' which made me wonder if either Karl is losing his edge (is Ricky finally getting through to him?) or have they simply run out of new ideas to throw at him.

The introduction of Warwick Davis does bring a new element into the series (you keep having those moments where you think, ""Oh ya!  He was also in..."" through the whole series) and his interactions with Karl make for the occasional chuckle, however in my opinion the jokes and experiences between the two of them feel completely fake and staged...until the very end.

Overall, without giving too much away on the series I will say that for fans of An Idiot Abroad it's a worthy addition to your Blu-ray collection (I have all 3 series myself) but for those looking to get into the series...do yourself a favor...start at the beginning as you will appreciate the complexities (or lack there of) of Mr. Karl Pilkington, a true Idiot Abroad.",1373328000,,1660,4.516666666666667
2803326,5,B000OYC7Q2,"If you like travel shows, this is a unique twist on seeing the world through the eyes of a very cynical and uncultured individual. Carl Pilkington travels the world and shows sides to society that most people would never imagine let alone want to experience. His jaded perspective on anything new and his cynicism make his experiences in the abroad hysterically funny.
It probably won't make anyone want to travel, but it will make them laugh:).",1372723200,,445,4.868421052631579
2803327,2,B000OYC7Q2,Something in the formula must have changed.  I can't really get excited about it.  Karl's a cranky-puss and is maybe suffering from burnout.,1372550400,4,140,5.043478260869565
2803328,5,B000OYC7Q2,"Karl Pilkington and Warwick Davis travel the Marco Polo route in this three episode series of the third An Idiot Abroad series.  Very funny, indeed.",1371945600,,148,4.92
2803329,4,B000OYC7Q2,"Season 3 is ""short"" (ironically), with only three episodes. Warwick Davis is an excellent choice for a traveling companion, and his sunny disposition makes for a good contrast with Karl's doom and gloom. I'm glad there is a third season, it's just I wish there were more episodes!",1369267200,,280,4.854166666666667
2803360,5,B000OYC7Q2,"I highly suggest you also listen to the podcasts.  If you listen to those much of the show will be more enjoyable.  Like for instance when he lays down to sleep on the round bed in India.  You won't know whithout podcasts that he sleeps with his legs off the side of the bed in order to ""trick his legs"".  Carl believes he has restless leg syndrome.  He believes that by keeping his legs in upright position off the edge of the bed they will not know he is sleeping and therefore will not become restless.  Oh goodness.  I really do like Carl.  Cant get enough.",1369180800,,561,4.226415094339623
2803361,5,B000OYC7Q2,"All 3 seasons are amazing and hilarious. Karl and Warwick make a hilarious duo. Ricky Gervais is brilliant. If you want to laugh till you cry, buy all of the seasons!",1369094400,,166,4.387096774193548
2803362,5,B000OYC7Q2,"I loved the first two seasons of An Idiot Abroad and couldn't wait for this to come out on DVD through Netflix, so my husband and I bought this from Amazon Video on Demand. Despite being shallow, slow, and offensive, Karl's trials and his reactions to them in the first two seasons endeared him to me somewhat. He had my sympathy when he was going through unnecessary crap (caused by Ricky), his interactions with locals made me laugh (the Mongolian throat singing was the best), and his observations were often spot-on and witty. In Season 3, Karl lost much of my sympathy in the absolutely horribly offensive things he said to to Warwick. (As I side note, I highly recommend Warwick's memoir, ""Size Matters Not."") But ultimately, the dynamic between the two of them was awesome and made for great television. The third and final episode was the best; it definitely had me laughing out loud.",1368144000,,892,4.7243589743589745
2803363,1,B000OYC7Q2,"I asked the specific question about whether or not this Blu-ray would work on equipment in the U.S., and was assured it would.  Unfortunately...IT DID NOT.

2803364,5,B000OYC7Q2,"Adding Warrick was an awesome choice. Karl and Warrick are a perfect match. Comedy at its best, I love the duo together! Highly recommend this season, I hope they make many more episodes of these two!",1366502400,,200,4.583333333333333
2803365,2,B000OYC7Q2,"Warrick is funny, but it really takes away from the simplton that is Karl!
Not a disaster, but just finished season 2, which I thought was brilliant",1366243200,8,148,4.518518518518518
2803366,5,B000OYC7Q2,"Do you know anything about dvds and big business?  Buy a region free player and watch anything from anywhere.  All of the Idiot Abroad series are better that the dreck that is sold here.  It was made for SKY One in the UK.  the discs are cheaper, ALL of the material is included AND there are extras galore!  Region free cost the same as regular blu-ray players.  Check Amazon.",1364083200,,377,4.391304347826087
2803367,5,B000OYC7Q2,"I love Karl. He stoically suffers every indignity as he travels about the world.  Well, it is a real treat to have Warwick (sp) Dunn travel with him in Season 3.  I think it adds wonderfully to Karl's grace under fire.  I'd love to see more.  In fact, my only disappointment with the show is that it is only 3 episodes.",1363824000,,319,4.180327868852459
2803368,3,B000OYC7Q2,"Three stars because it provided an evening of entertainment for my friends, but was lackluster compared to the previous two seasons. It being only three episodes actually made it more appealing. The premise seems to be dead, and the show seems forced.

Warwick Davis is awesome in it and a really great counterpart to Karl.

I recommend it if you were a fan of the previous seasons, but don't expect anything spectacular.",1363824000,,421,4.833333333333333
2803369,4,B000OYC7Q2,I enjoyed their podcasts immensely and Idiot Abroad is no exception. I do have to say Season 1 & 2 were better. I think I just enjoy Carl alone out of his element the most.,1363651200,,172,3.942857142857143
2803420,3,B000OYC7Q2,"I don't understand it.  Warwick is brilliant, his addition to the show should have worked on so many levels least of which was simply to annoy Karl with his positive attitude.  Turns out, I really just enjoy Karl whinging and Warwick was more of a distraction from the punishment of Karl than it was an addition.  I've listened to Karl since the XFM days and so far this was my least favorite Karl 'experience' yet.  Shame.",1363564800,3,423,4.526315789473684

2803422,4,B000OYC7Q2,"Another enjoyable, but too brief, turn at the 'Idiot' series. The twist, and you knew there had to be one, is that Karl is paired with a mate this time around.

To finish off the reported absolute final in the series, the intention was to go out with a bang. And to address that, our man had requested a traveling companion; obviously hoping that Rickey would join him in a not-so-subtle attempt to embarrass and humiliate his primary tormentor.

Cackling Gervais had other plans.

Bridging seasons two and three, Warwick Davis, the actor from 'Willow' and a host of other films, joins Karl on the Marco Polo Route. You might recall it was he whom Karl had called from the final scene in Season Two's final in China.

His reaction upon learning who would be accompanying him: ""I don't know how it will work out, honestly. Edmund Hillary had that Tenzing fellow, Ben Fogle had James Cracknell. I've been given an Ewok."" Incredibly, said right in front of his would-be partner. No hesitation, no social grace, uttered from the perspective of a boorish - if perceptive - child. Sometimes I wonder if Karl does this intentionally, with some deeper sense of gaining television ratings. But then I realize - no, like it or not, he's just brutally honest.

Following in the footsteps of the great Venetian trader, so begins the pair's adventure.

Season Three's comedy comes in the contrasting form of Warwick's tenacity and willingness to accept the differences between various peoples and their cultures - and Karl being himself. Still, it would be disingenuous to say this was all tickles and giggles. The brevity of this season certainly limits the potential for humor, as we don't get to see the team really worn down to the point where conflict can truly generate gut-busting laughs. Simultaneously explaining the understandable sympathetic undertone to the series; dampening what could've been possible. One knows that pushing too hard with certain people can easily cross the line into cruelty. But thankfully Karl pushes right up to that line.

Example: When the pair are in Szechuan, the goal is The 10 Faced Buddha Temple on Mount Emei. Thousands of stone steps, more than 1,000 meters up the side of a mountain, Warwick breaks down. Not physically, but mentally. Though one might be hard pressed to see the difference.

Karl did.

Nobly redeeming himself from the shameful ""carnival"" episode - he utilizes reverse psychology and pushes Warwick to conquer the mountain. Literally. And I couldn't help but think back to Mount Fuji. Remember? The manc climbed for a stunning 18 hours straight! So recall that before you pass judgment as he prods and cajoles the film star, whose tears reveal that he was indeed on the verge of defeat. Sympathetically, Karl had been there himself and wouldn't allow Warwick to take the easy road and quit.

Overall, very enjoyable. But obviously three episodes aren't nearly enough to fulfill a true season of programming. This seemed less a journey and more a brief excursion. For myself, I hope that one day Rickey & Co considers doing ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pole-to-Pole/dp/B000R7I49K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pole to Pole</a>"". Honestly, in my opinion, that would be insanely funny. Today, there are now at least two active war zones along Palin's original path of 30 degrees east longitude.

Active War Zone + Karl = Fun hijinks.

Let the games begin! :-D

Series Notes:

- Due to Warwick's challenges, the likely explanation for the brevity of the third series; which sadly comprised all of three episodes and a fourth special sit-down dissection.

- Co-host Stephen Merchant's non-presence was due to his work on a film. Unfortunate. It's his humorous insights that often give Gervais the more rounded approach to admonishing our man.",1360886400,5,3826,5.0894568690095845
2803423,5,B000OYC7Q2,I will miss Carl now that this was the last season. Please please bring him back! He never fails to make me double over in laughter. This season was even better with his friend along for the ride. They were both hilarious!,1360627200,2,222,4.309523809523809
2803424,5,B000OYC7Q2,"I could not wait to get into the 3rd season of an Idiot abroad after watching the first 2 seasons and falling in love with the Idiot that is Karl Pilkington. I have to say I was a little wary of the fact that he was going to have a sidekick. I wasn't sure how that was going to work and I thought it might take away too much from Karl's airtime but I shouldn't have worried, the banter between them is just hilarious.
Karl is a little more outgoing on this trip which I really liked, it wasn't all just grumbling and moaning, he really seemed to be enjoying himself and Warwick is a total joy to watch.",1360281600,,602,4.067226890756302

The pairing of Karl Pilkington and Warrick is not a happy one.  Normally Karl's insights, commentary, trials and tribulations make for very funny watching.  Now everyone just seems miserable and ticked off.  Don't waste your time or money on this season.  So disappointing as I was really looking forward to Season 3.",1359936000,4,468,4.7875
2803426,5,B000OYC7Q2,"Warwick Davis is upbeat, sarcastic, and full of life. Carl Pilkington is a wet blanket. Put them together you have a snarky, understated, travel comedy featuring a veery unlikely pair who aren't even friends. I can't wait for more episodes.

Politics (68 mins) showcases a slighty more streamlined and hipper Ricky than Animals, and suffers lightly from this slicker RG, it is still funny as you please however.  The extras on Politics are lengthier and funnier particularly the 19 min with Karl Pilkington,  he is hilarious to listen to on Ricky's podcasts but even funnier to look at (him and his little freak book)  Also very funny is Robin Ince and Rickys commentary track.

8187378,5,B000OYC7Q2,"This is a double DVD release of two other DVD's that are available individually. So, reviewed as stand alone releases;

Animals;

This is one of a number of Ricky Gervais live DVD's out on the market.

This particular product won't play on all DVD players however due to region coding. Please don't join the queue of morons who buy it and then act stunned that something clearly marked as not compatible with all DVD players isn't - gasp - compatible with all DVD players.

Having made that public service announcement I can continue on to say that this produce shows Gervais at his wonderfully understated best, weaving a gentle tale of gags that run the gamut from observational, satirical to slapstick. The show is not overlong but there is a lot of material in it. The man is obviously playing to an adoring audience in his home country. There is swearing in this DVD but it's not thrown about like confetti as per someone like Billy Connolly and in fact there is probably less of it than in 1990's era Ben Elton.

The DVD has a few extras which are OK, they do add to the value though aren't earth shattering.

Excellent stand up comedy by someone who is obviously quite intelligent and who doesn't need to reduce everything to its base element to get a laugh.

And now for a review of the Politics DVD;

Huge tip for young players. You see the bit in the product description in the boxed text saying this is a region 2 disc? Well, that means you need a DVD player capable of playing discs formatted for that zone. So don't by the bleedin' thing, be unable to play it and then leave a one star review that makes you - yes you - looking like a chump.

Now that's off my chest I can state that this live DVD by Ricky Gervais is similar in format to his 'Animals' DVD in that it is a very understated stage performance where he chats away in a pretty non-demonstrative manner and discusses all sorts of things. The title Politics is really just an excuse to attack a few subjects from a certain angle but really he doesn't get very political at all and in fact much of the show is just a standard stand up routine.

The understated nature of it does drag it down somewhat - it helps him stand out from the crowd but on this release it's a little too much. He very much comes across as an intelligent chap and he doesn't feel the need to curse every 10 seconds to try to get a laugh or appear outrageous. Much of the material is very good observational humour and he's obviously playing to a crowd who are fans, this isn't a filmed slot at a comedy festival.

The extras on the DVD are pretty abysmal. There is one feature where Ricky interviews Carl Pilkington and carries on in overacted laughter as Pilkington says a bunch of stuff Gervais can't really say in his show, much of which isn't funny anyway. And then we get behind the scenes stuff that really is hard to sit through even once. Quite sad really.

If you are a Gervais fan - and there are plenty out there - then this is a good release to pick up. He is in good form here and there are lots of laughs, his central tenet alas doesn't form as central a point to hold things together as well as in Animals but it's still worth having.",1489276800,,3196,4.317195325542571
