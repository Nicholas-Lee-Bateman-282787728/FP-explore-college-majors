3884139,4,B002AILLE4,"This is a very good primer for the new F800GS owner. (That would be me.) Exceeding detail, good tips in the vein of ""I've done this five different ways, made lots of mistakes, so here's how to do it right.""

I thought there might be more video of actual riding, and riding technique. There's none. There may be one minute of riding - a sequence of people dropping their bikes in a muddy spot and crossing a creek. The title, ""F800GS Adventure Touring Instructional DVD"" is misleading. There's not much about adventure touring, except all the farkle you can set up your bike with.

I wouldn't recommend this for anyone who doesn't have this bike - it's four hours of very specific info. But I feel way more informed about my particular machine now.",1262995200,4,747,4.567164179104478
3884140,3,B002AILLE4,This video has good information for those just entering the adventure touring riding.  Even though this is BMW F800 specific it also has general information useful to all who want to explore off-road riding.  I found the Bio's of different riders and the modifications done to their F800's very interesting.  It was helpful in making a more informed decision in my personal modification choices.,1250380800,6,395,5.140625
8359508,5,B002AILLE4,Great info for travelers.,1498348800,,25,5.5
8359509,4,B002AILLE4,"I think this DVD is very helpful and worth $35,  You will feel a lot more comfortable Removing front and rear wheels, change tires, oil change and even disk brakes.  Rest of DVD is just fun to watch, other riders tell you why the like 800gs and acessories they installed.",1416096000,,271,4.4
8359510,2,B002AILLE4,"I enjoyed the videos but found them limited in their information. I was hoping to get some riding tips and issues specific to the F800GS rather than the very basics of how to change the filters and oil.

Although I found some parts informative, I found the instruction in some cases to be long winded, i.e. the showing of how to change a flat tyre in two difference areas of the same DVD.",1394064000,,388,4.315068493150685
8359511,5,B002AILLE4,"Helge is a wonderful teacher, we bought a used 09 F800 and he was able to answer many questions through this video.",1392163200,,115,4.2727272727272725
8359512,3,B002AILLE4,Not a great DVD but does work to a degree.  The author/writer is a great guy with tons of experience but this DVD is a serious stretch to illustrate his competence.,1361145600,,164,4.290322580645161
8359513,4,B002AILLE4,"It helps you to know how to change a tire, oil, filters, repair a puncture, lube the chain and gives you advice of important equipments to have in an adveture ride by interviewing a few bike adventurers. The guy is funny and all the information is given in a funny way. Too bad the video resolution is lousy, especially if you have a large TV.",1358121600,2,343,4.292307692307692
8359514,2,B002AILLE4,"It will teach you how to chance a flat tire on the front and back of the bike. Also, they show you how to change the oil and other really basic stuff. That is it. I was expecting more.",1309392000,4,184,3.7435897435897436
8359515,1,B002AILLE4,"I bought this soon as I bought the motorcycle F800GS. I watched and personally I consider it realized not professionally. Way too much Touratech hidden advertise.

I watched the oil change and was done in a silly manner: spilled oil on pipes and bash plate ... not acceptable.

I am sure they could fit the data on one DVD not 2 DVDs

It was a waste of my money. I learned nothing. I would prefer to see those mechanical operations done by a mechanic not by a clown.",1301616000,5,466,4.2727272727272725
8359516,4,B002AILLE4,"I liked so much this video, it's interesting, serious, with a lot of practical tips we can experiment ourselves dealing with this bike (F800 GS)",1297036800,,144,4.8
8359517,4,B002AILLE4,"For those riders who have discovered the sheer magic of this new bike from BMW, they will obviously want to use it in far more remote places than your other bike (in my case the Harley). This DVD is a folksy but accurate and very useful way to learn how to change the tyres and do all the other basic maintenance that you will need to know to go offroad. For a screwdriver klutz like me, this is a real gem. Thank you.",1268524800,4,418,4.048192771084337
