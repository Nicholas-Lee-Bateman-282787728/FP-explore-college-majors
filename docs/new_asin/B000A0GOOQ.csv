With this video they actually left the room after about 3 minutes.  To use M. Beattie's words (because they are very appropriate) this video is ""painfully stupid""!  Luckily, this was a library rental, and it immediately went back.  I wouldn't recommend this video to anyone with kids of *any* age.",1196121600,,469,4.886075949367089
