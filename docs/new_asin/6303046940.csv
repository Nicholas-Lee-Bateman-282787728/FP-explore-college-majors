538902,4,6303046940,"This is a very nice little documentary about the man behind the myth.  While it does aim to present Edward Abbey as an exceptional individual, I wouldn't go so far as to suggest (as another reviewer does) that it is merely a puff piece, polishing the halo of ""St. Abbey.""  It's very frank about his contradictions and weaknesses and infidelities, and presents a picture of Ed (I call him Ed because I feel like I know him after reading so many of his books and especially after this documentary) from a number of perspectives.  Certainly there is no one here who simply hates him or hates what he stands for, but I'm not sure what that would add to a posthumous documentary biography.  Of course his views are controversial and the documentary doesn't try to water them down!  Among the more interesting things that come out of this doc is the fact that Ed was baffled by the success of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Desert-Solitaire/dp/0671695886/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Desert Solitaire</a>, and really wanted to be known as a novelist.  It's also just worth getting to hear Ed's voice -- it's not at all the voice I would have expected from reading his books but now it seems quite appropriate: a soft spoken, amused and ironic tone.

One thing worth noting is that this film is available on DVD but not through Amazon.  You have to get it direct from the distributor (and pay with PayPal), at Canyon Productions (just type it into google for the website, since I can't put websites here).  I've had my VHS copy for years and worn it out showing it to students as we read Desert Solitaire -- and I just ordered the dvd.  Highly recommended for environmentalists and lovers of Abbey's work; also recommended for those who know nothing about him and just might get intrigued enough by the documentary to pick up one of his books.",1236038400,8,1878,4.89589905362776
538903,3,6303046940,"This is as much a halo-burnisher portrait of St. Ed Abbey as is Jack Loeffler's memoir book.

That said, the video does have Ed in his own words. I could see and hear for myself the ""shyness,"" or diffidence, or whatever, that Loeffler and others had talked about that was a characteristic of Abbey the conversationalist.

That said, it reinforces my belief that Abbey did have a drinking problem and that's what caused his fatal esophageal varices. Alcohol, after all, has been known through the ages as a lubricant that some use to attempt to lower social inhibitions of all sorts.

But, as with Loeffler's book, and somewhat Cahalan's biography, we don't get what made Ed tick. Yes, we can sort of see how Anarchist Ed could use Western wilderness as the canvas for his particular loner-anarchist mix, but, what made Ed a loner, and an anarchist, in the first place?

We're still missing that.

And, otherwise, production values are decent but not fantastic. And, we're missing all sorts of stuff. Didn't anybody have a video camera at either one of Abbey's wakes? That's why I wouldn't quite rate it great for a St. Ed fan, either.",1223078400,,1134,4.7360406091370555

7835162,4,6303046940,"Well I thought this was a bit slow-going.  I liked the footage of Edward Abbey best, and some of the interviews were good too.  Actually I was hoping to see the film ""Wrenched"" and thought this was it but turned out to be a different film.  Huh well, it was nice to see one of my favorite writers on film and learn a bit more about his life.  I think my favorite line was towards the end where Ed is told he has x amount of time to live and he told his friend, ""I guess this means I don't have to floss anymore.""  Love his sense of humor.",1425168000,2,538,3.8990825688073394

7835164,5,6303046940,Edward Abbey was a ranger at Arches National Monument and writes about this experiences there. I have never read such excellent prospe and interesting metaphors.

7835165,5,6303046940,Edward Abby is one of my personal heroes! The Monkey Wrench Gang should be required reading for every high schooler. Maybe they would not be the lost generation and able to do the Occupy movement right!

7835166,5,6303046940,"Anything on Abbey I consider a rare gem. A documentary video on Abbey is a rare diamond. This is a fantastic look into his life and death. Abbey was a brash, crude, intimate, fascinating American writer. His love of the American southwest permeates through his writing, which is unmistakable. Cactus Ed's books should be a required read for all of America's schools. This documentary made me wish he was still littering the highways with beer cans, ""Of course I litter the public highway. Every chance I get. After all, it's not the beer cans that are ugly; it's the highway that is ugly.""",1292198400,5,589,4.728155339805825
7835167,5,6303046940,"Edward Abbey: A Voice in the Wilderness provides a wild ride with the late, great Edward Abbey, a singular environmentalist with a variety of followers, friends, and colleagues.  This film captures Abbey's iconoclastic spirit wonderfully... so well that those of us who loved his writing (fiction and non-fiction) grieve anew for America's loss.  Abbey fought hard (without taking himself for a saint) for the West... all too often a place trashed for greed at the expense of those who love it (including its wildlife).  Every school ought to have a copy of this film.  Every woman and man who loves the planet ought to have a copy.  And we should all show it to as many friends as we have.",1292198400,4,690,4.716666666666667
