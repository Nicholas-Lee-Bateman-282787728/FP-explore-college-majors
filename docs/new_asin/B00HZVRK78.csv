8637674,1,B00HZVRK78,"Wow talk about awful movies.
Van Damne and Steven Segal have both been far better.
One movie ""Into the Sun"" is so bad that the voice is not Steven Segal and even the lip sync is so terrible it's just plain obvious.
Must be a Chinese  black market.
Not worth the $5 bucks to purchase this thing.",1459123200,,294,4.157894736842105

8637679,2,B00HZVRK78,"OK if you like Action Movies, but nowhere close to Chuck Norris, John Wayne.  The price was right but nothing like a good Rambo or Indiana Jones.  Use to like Van Damne and Steven Segal, but their acting in these movies not as good as some of the other movies I've seen them in.  The only good thing about this package was the price.",1425686400,,333,4.171875
