8640495,3,B00IAR2CS8,"I tend to like documentaries and I thought this was an interesting subject. I guess all I really knew about Dr. Livingstone was that he went off and explored and was considered missing for many years until he was found. Sadly, there is much more to him, his life and his explorations. I say sadly simply because the story is such a hard one to swallow involving slavery, massacres and his health.

This documentary could have been so much more interesting. It just seemed to plod along and really didn't seem to get interesting. The experts interviewed really didn't seem passionate about their subject so much as they just seemed to be reciting facts.

Several times the show relied on the gross factor to up the interest - in one scene is shows him needing to pull his own teeth because they are loose due to malnutrition and illness. After showing how he did this, it gave a close up of the actor with his bloody mouth spitting out his tooth.

I think that if I had to do a report on Dr. Livingstone this would be a great resource. However, this was not a wonderful show. Secrets of the Dead usually does so much better, I'd give this one a skip.",1518393600,2,1149,4.410377358490566

8640497,3,B00IAR2CS8,"Dr. Livingstone described a massacre in Africa that helped to end the practice of slavery there.  He had run out of paper and ink, so he wrote his private thoughts in berry juice on a newspaper.  This work explores how that writing was able to be read for the first time.
I applaud the actions and courage of abolitionists and other anti-racist whites.  However, many of them gave mixed signals and wouldnt meet the smell test in todays multicultural standards.  On the one hand, Lincoln freed the slaves, but if I heard correctly he also made statements about Blacks being inferior to whites.  Margaret Mead tried to suggest that a non-white culture was pioneering and less sexist than the West.  However, some feel that she just used Samoans to make strides for white women in the West.  Here too, Dr. Livingstone does not seem perfect.  Again, he is incredibly laudatory for opposing slavery and working to achieve its termination.  However, this work suggests that when he needed to, he would work with slave traders and use the labor of slaves.  He took the cures of witch doctors seriously when other Europeans would have dismissed them.  He helped to map a region that was thought to be unknowable.
The work says machines used by NASA had to be used to extract Livingstones writing.  However, sometimes they showed his writing and even I could figure out some of his words.  There are people out there who are excellent at reading messy writing.  I kinda think they could have transcribed his words if they were given enough time to look at documents.  Further, the work doesnt reveal how the newspaper print was able to be downplayed and the cursive emphasized until well into the middle of the program.  I applaud everyone involved in deciphering these diary entries.  Still, something tells me that someone could have done it before now.  Think about it, scholars have been able to read Ancient Egyptian, Greek, Mayan, Mesopotamian, inter alia, for decades, despite worn-down paper and lots of lacunae.  Why would this be deemed difficult to accomplish?
In final comments, the narrator states, Livingstone was no saint.  He never found the source of the Nile.  This is not a gushy work, although it adequately praises his accomplishments.  The work said he was a poor missionary.  It added that he lost his reputation when his wife and others died on one of his expeditions.  Still, most importantly, the work concludes by noting that stopping the slave trade in that region also involved more European colonization that could bring injustice as well.  They never mention apartheid here, but the activities here happen in the lower half of Africa where many atrocities have been occurring for the past two centuries.
Like some other documentaries, this showed one of the subjects descendants.  The work wasn't that diverse in terms of interviewees.  I don't recall seeing any African interviewees here.  The re-enactments are well-filmed, unlike some of the cheesy stuff from History Channel about 15 or 20 years ago.  The Secrets of the Dead series has an expansive coverage.  It doesnt just look at gravesites or how murders took place.  The secrets here were from a deceased man who left us without intrigue.  However, this installment effectively helps the voice of a late person to be expressed again.",1397952000,7,3316,4.918918918918919
