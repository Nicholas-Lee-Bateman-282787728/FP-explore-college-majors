I have searched local  video stores and every possible on-line resource, but to no avail.  I truly  hope that this video is re-released.",967852800,,253,3.9215686274509802

We have three more  children now at the perfect ages 3,1, 7 months, to watch it.  It was our  oldest son's favorite and we wish it could be the others' favorite too.",966988800,,292,4.142857142857143

The tape is put in just for that preview. I even love  it. I would love to get this tape for my daughter. Please re-release it.",965260800,2,297,4.016949152542373

7834014,5,6302973791,My nephew had this along with the Billy Bunny tape when he was a baby. I love them!! Really wish I could find them in DVD. If you have to be driven crazy watching a tape all day and have silly songs stuck in you head... these are my picks!,1285545600,,239,3.8
7834015,5,6302973791,I'm going to go out on a limb and just say it... I'm 22 and I still like watching this video. In particular I've been trying to find the CD of it because I like some of the songs that much. I got hooked on it when my little brother recieved it as a present and even he likes some of the songs still (although he'd never admit it). A must by for anyone/ family that has kids that enjoy sing alongs!,1069286400,5,397,3.8536585365853657
7834016,5,6302973791,"I've watched this video for the first time in 1997 when I came to U.S. at a friends house to take care of her baby.  We, baby and I, enjoyed a lot, but I did more, much more because it help me in the process of learning the language, and I really loved the songs.  Since I moved to U.S. I've been looking for this video for my two babies, because I'm sure they'll love it as much as I did.  I know that lots of people did not had the chance of enjoying this video because they did not had the oportunity of knowing it, but they sure will buy it if it's back.  It's a shame that there are lots of videos and cartoons for kids nowadays that are really not, in my opinion, for kids.  With a message of encouragement or being happy.  We need movies like ""It's Not Easy Being Green"" back on stores.",1023667200,2,793,3.9873417721518987
7834017,5,6302973791,"This video is a great sing-a-long for all ages. I've been searching for this video for years on line. My son who has autism and is non-verbal loves this video and his old copy has had it from so much use. Please re-release this great Kernit the frog sing-a-long video so that all children can enjoy the magic of music at home. I don't understand why these videos disappear from the stores, surely they will sell. It is so hard finding good,clean videos anymore and this being such a classic from the muppets who are still very popular. I hope someone reads this and can offer this great muppet sing-a-long to the public to order as soon as possible. THANK YOU !  Sincerely Judy Keller from Ohio.",971568000,10,695,4.47244094488189
