8551261,3,B00AG6Z3LE,I know it is an art film and important after 400 blows.  But I had a tough time focusing and embedding my heart and soul in this one.  Definitely rent 400 Blows.,1492041600,,161,4.0
8551262,5,B00AG6Z3LE,"I love this piece like I love a dark, cold work of classical music. It's something vast and true, and one must love it if one loves the cinema of pain and violence. It is a visionary film. The images are hypnotic. It's in black and white and there's one scene where our hero's blood falls onto a white, wet surface, and we just focus for perhaps two whole minutes on the water lapping up against the drops of blood, sculpting them into strange, moving shapes that seem alive and somehow tragic.
My interpretation of this movie is that the boy is  a serious schizophrenic who lives in a tragically violent imaginary world. This idea dawned on me slowly. Because we basically experience the movie from inside his head, it doesn't matter what's real and what isn't. He can't tell the difference, why should we? Going in with that attitude makes it much more fun to watch.",1403740800,2,868,4.528662420382165
8551263,5,B00AG6Z3LE,"Not to all tastes but for those who have a true love of truth in cinema, this is a must-see.  I'll stop just short of calling anyone who sees it and does not like it a dunderhead.  When an opportunity comes along to see a lean, no-nonsense piece of art, take that opportunity.  Highly recommended.",1370736000,4,297,4.363636363636363
