8196513,5,B000QI6AZ0,"""The man who cried"" the title itself says such a lot of things to the viewer, an amazing performence by Johnny Depp who played the role of a man who can commnunicate with eyes, one of his best performences ever indeed. The chemistry between Ricci and Depp is excellent and beyond words. The film has its sensitive, happy, erotic and sad moments, but nevertheless beautifull. Christina Ricci was fabulous, she potrayed every sentiment beautifully and you can see that easily. A film worth a watch, if you like Silent dramas. Worth watching for good cast-performences, wonderfull musical scores and last but not the least, a good chemistry between actors.",1228867200,,653,5.0
