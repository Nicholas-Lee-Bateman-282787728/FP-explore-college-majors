8697833,4,B00S9CN4EK,"Years ago, I taped this movie off of a Baltimore TV station, which showed it overnight. That TV copy was poor quality, with lots of breaks in the film (and not just the commercial interruptions). Warner Archives has now released this 1937 RKO musical on DVD. The plot is similar to Mel Brooks' 1968 film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Producers-Deluxe-Edition/dp/B000BMY2LU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Producers (Deluxe Edition)</a>, in that a corrupt Broadway producer, Robert Hunt (Jerome Cowan) obtains excessive financing for several flop musicals, and absconds with the money. When one of the stars of Hunt's new production, ""New Faces,"" Elaine Dorset (Thelma Leeds), threatens to expose Hunt's scheme, he leaves town, and leaves the musical in the hands of his assistant, Wallington Wedge (played by a very young Milton Berle). Wedge turns the show into a hit, and eventually makes good with the financial backers who Hunt ripped off.

Among the other new faces in the film are band singer Harriett Hilliard, who had just married Ozzie Nelson a couple of years earlier; radio comedians Joe Penner and Harry Parke (a.k.a. Parkyakarkus, the father of comedians Albert Brooks and Bob Einstein [a.k.a. Super Dave Osborne]), and two young tap dancers: the little-known (and long-forgotten) Lorraine Krueger, and 14-year-old Ann Miller (in her film debut). Annie was magnificent even then; she reportedly lied about her age (claiming to be 16) to get the part. Those two dance numbers are worth the price of admission, but the rest of the musical numbers are entertaining, as is the film as a whole, despite the thin plot. Four stars.",1478908800,,1686,5.484615384615385
