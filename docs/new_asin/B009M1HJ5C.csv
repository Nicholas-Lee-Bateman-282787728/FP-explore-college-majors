8542902,4,B009M1HJ5C,"Saw it in a theater. Proper disclosure: I love good slapstick, and this movie has plenty of it. Sasha, a thirtyish piano player and composer, still living with his mother (!) and fluttering like a butterfly from one nubile one-night-stand flower to another, hits a really bad scene. He falls head-over-heels for Charlotte, a thirtyish separated mother of three. This is particularly bad for Sasha, because  a) he hates children; b) has a career to make; c) Chrlotte's estranged husband just happens to be his all-powerful client. We follow Sasha and Charlotte through their ups and downs, tumultous getting together and splitting, crying, loughing, and getting into bed with great gusto. Both Gad Elmaleh (Sasha) and Sophie Marceau (Charlotte) are excellent actors who manage to pull this slightly silly and overdone movie through. Marceau is definitely the stuff that male dreams are made off, which does not hurt. The directing is good and the music excellent. And children, as usual, are always a bonus. Did I forget the slapstick? Look for Charlotte splatting out in front of Sasha at their first meeting and also getting the kick out of...the bathroom sink. It might not make the best place in a serious movie contest, but it's a lot of fun.",1484438400,,1246,4.961722488038277
8542903,1,B009M1HJ5C,"A love comedy played by two handsome and talented, actors, plus an older famous French actor, in the most beautiful city ever built. No fun at all.
How can this be? Evidently, poor directing and a terrible script. Adding insult to injury, two characters who should be most endearing: the old grandma in oxygen and the family's baby are both just rude tiresome monsters. Who wants to see that? Not funny guys!
Slapstick is excessive and repetitive. Comic rhythms are misplaced, or wrongly utilized. Jokes just not funny. Sex scenes too contrived.
Is this about a poor man victimized by some princess, or the plight of women in a man's world? Script writer too weak to explore it. Director too inexperienced to portray it. There are wonderful French comedies put out by both French and foreign directors, but this one is not one of them.
Finally, the weakest and most pathetic point is the illusion that their ""vaudeville act"" and outstanding American soundtrack could possibly impress newyorkers. Give me a break!",1443916800,,1012,4.923976608187134
