306936,3,6301049284,"The ending of this movie had an interesting twist which I myself enjoyed, or found funny, but others might hate.  I reccomend watching this movie ONLY if you HAVE SEEN any of River Phoenix's other movies already.  If you see his style of acting first then you will know why River himself didn't like making the movie that much...although I did love the ending.",970876800,,360,4.609375
306937,4,6301049284,"I had mixed feelings before viewing this movie, because many critics called it a bomb and Phoenix, himself, did not like making this movie. This turned out to be a very good movie. Pheonix, looks so natural in the role  as if he wasn't even acting (like all his other performaces.) I had the  same ""bittersweet"" type feeling at the end of this movie like I  did in ""Stand by Me."" Strangeley, I find movies like this a sense  of inspiration. ""A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon"" is  directed quite well, has good supporting performaces, but it's Phoenix who  makes it so great. The ending with the ""Nothing is beyond you""  poster is very cool. RIP Phoenix. e-mail DEATHSQUAD'S HWANG at  tommyfresh@webtv.net",950313600,,708,4.653225806451613
306938,5,6301049284,"I originally just rented this movie to see River Phoenix's performance. It was actually very entertaining. It had one of those great feelings to it. I read that he didn't like making this movie ,but he still acted very well. It's funny & I'm not totally sure as to how to define it's great cool feeling.  END",880588800,,308,4.4035087719298245
307024,5,6301049284,I really do love this movie of a young man coming of age and how life really is hard when u have too grow up. River Phoenix really does portray a the way most men think at that age but at the same time shows how sometimes they will realize when they need to grow up and make the right decision,1384041600,,293,3.819672131147541
307025,5,6301049284,"A Christmas Gift for my daughter, she loves it. Though sixteen, she loves movies of the '80's. She loves Brat Pack movies along with all the pack members but she's especially crazy about River Phoenix. What a waste of his talent and the loss of a very bright and promising career.",1326499200,,280,4.509803921568627
307026,3,6301049284,"It's a decent movie. Had some really funny moments. If you're a River Phoenix fan or a fan of 80's comedies, you have to watch this. I liked the movie, but I'm a also a huge River Phoenix fan. There is nothing overall special about the script or the characters, but the acting of Phoenix is good. You also get to see a very young Matthew Perry, who would later go on to star on the sitcom Friends.",1265155200,,397,4.102564102564102
307027,3,6301049284,"I am a River Phoenix fan,and I personally think he made a good portrayal of what a teenager with family, group pressure, sexuality, friendship, and personal issues deals with, and how good and bad decisions turn out to have a diffrent outcome than the ones one might expect.",1221955200,,274,4.729166666666667

307029,5,6301049284,"The best actor of his generation. He was too young when he died. He was a great actor. He was also great in Running on Empty,Stand By Me,Dog Fight,Sneakers,The Mosquito Coast,Little Nikkita,Explores,Silent Tongue.",1174694400,,213,5.484848484848484
307030,5,6301049284,This film is one of the best coming of age films ever made.  It's defintely one of the best teen films of the 80's.  We lost a great actor in the making when we lost River Pheonix.  Check it out you won't be disappointed.,1094860800,8,221,3.977272727272727
307031,4,6301049284,"I remeber this movie in 1988 quite well because I was transfixed by River Phoenix's character. Based on the novel by Bill Richert ""Aren't you even going to kiss me goodbye"" Phoenix plays Jimmy a smooth talking charming  kid from a working class family who lives in the richer side of town. Hangs with these rich kids who are the type to die if they ever lost their money. While trying to impress and win the heart of the one girl who ever really got to him his girlfriend Lisa ( Meredith Salenger) before she moves to Hawaii. He gets himself into hard situations and troubles just about every relationship he has by sleeping with his best friends ( Mathew Perry) girlfriend,  has sex with his mothers best friend. Then smashes his fathers  car up in the course of one night. River's character in this film is the type that has a charisma that makes it hard for people to say no to or stay mad at. A funny teen angst movie excellent performance by River Phoenix they couldn't of casted anyone else for this role. One of my favorite 80's coming of age films worth viewing.",1084838400,14,1070,4.4213197969543145
307032,4,6301049284,"A hard film to review this one. I'm tempted to say it's a crock of ..., but I'm a Phoenix fan. And while the direction is uninspired (and at times downright sluggish), Phoenix is as usual engaging. The supporting actresses are all very unique and decidedly quirky - particularly amusing is the underused Louanne as Susie, and Matthew Perry in an early role as Phoenix's best downtrodden friend is amusing.
Director Richert worked with Phoenix again in Gus van Sant's My Own Private Idaho, this time acting.",997401600,3,506,4.827586206896552

7809141,2,6301049284,"Enjoy the kid porn flowing out of Hollywood, y'all, ever since the days of Shirley Temple and Matt Dillon.  River said he hated this movie because his character was a jerk.  In that context, it's obvious that this film got made because of Hollywood's exploitation M.O.  It's kind of like ""The Flamingo Kid,"" but with more graphic sex and a lot of voice-overs.  R.I.P.

All is well that ends well but I can tell it ends for him here in or around this.  A fun story and he does the job but the story is better than him.  Well, it should be, I guess.  But maybe it is me but I am not happy with him here as I am with most of him any where else.",1398816000,,432,3.357142857142857

I had to buy it, and I'm glad I did.  I do wish they would digitally update/adjust the coloring and what not like they do to so many movies these days.  Either way, it is a funny movie!
