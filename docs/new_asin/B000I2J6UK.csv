8143224,4,B000I2J6UK,"Frank Vincent(GoodFellas, Casino, Jungle Fever) makes a great special appearance  in this crime drama as the mob don Carlo who has to send out his guys to teach corrupt coalition boss Akey(played by Raekwon) a lesson. You also have other great cast stars such as Chuck Zito(Carlito's Way), Sal Sirchia(Jesse), and Michael Wright(Sugar Hill). If you enjoyed Sugar Hill, Blue Hill Avenue, and West New York, then buy it!",1409961600,,418,5.057971014492754
8143225,5,B000I2J6UK,The script and Acting could have been better... But since I worked on the film...I gace it a 5. Biased I know. I'd give it a 1 to be honest,1180051200,,139,3.6666666666666665
8143226,3,B000I2J6UK,"This movie was ok , it could have been better with a bigger budget. Raekwon starred in it, and was not that great of an actor. It hardly gets 3 stars from me.",1172448000,,158,3.8181818181818183
