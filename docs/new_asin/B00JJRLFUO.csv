6362983,5,B00JJRLFUO,This is a fascinating program ! It discusses the discoveries of archaeologists under the streets of London. I am amazed how much is learned about bubonic plague and about Roman gladiators . I am also very surprised at the magnitude of  material found preserved underground that is HUNDREDS of years old . This program makes you wish plane fare was cheap . I thoroughly enjoyed this program and think anyone who appreciates history would not be disappointed .,1423958400,5,458,4.871794871794871
6362984,4,B00JJRLFUO,"I enjoy urban archeology though these days it is usually a vicarious enjoyment. As a kid, I explored almost every nook and cranny of Cleveland's Terminal Tower and I sure wish I could go back and do it again but it is no longer the magical place it once was. I fondly remember many other obscure locations such as the basement at Publix Book Store or the one at Western Salvage. It was always fun to drive through the flats and see all the industry. Another bright memory is of touring the Los Angeles Subway Terminal Building a few decades ago and seeing the abandoned subway tunnels. The point is that my experiences left me with high hopes for this video and perhaps that was the problem. It was a good video and I'm glad I got it but I was expecting more so was left a little disappointed. That's probably more my fault than theirs. I have to admit they did show some really cool places. Perhaps part of my disappointment is just that I wish I could see it in person? Don't let me deter you from buying the disc though, or you'll miss out on some great history.",1417910400,6,1065,4.303482587064677

6362988,5,B00JJRLFUO,Originally viewed this 1 hour program on PBS.  It is an extremely interesting history of what is under the ground in London.  Anxiously looking forward to adding this to my DVD collection.,1406160000,,188,4.84375
8651474,4,B00JJRLFUO,"This show isn't about just THE London subway system = The Tube = The Underground. We see many layers. After all, as the narrator tells us, ""The very first layer of the city was laid down as far back as 50 a.d.""

First we see a Roman amphitheater. In 1987, a contractor uncovered its ruins up to 30 feet below the surface. The amphitheater was in use for 250 years and then lost for centuries. Today, you can see part of it in a museum created underground in situ, with florescent lights showing where the stands would have been.

Then there's the plague pits, especially the mass burials from the 1665 plague. They collect and store the bones, one person to a cardboard box. So far, they've got 20,000 boxes.

Also see the 22 miles of Chislehurst Caves, where chalk was mined. The Thames Tunnel, ""the first tunnel under a river, anywhere in the world."" The Fleet River, completely covered over since 1870. Churchill's bunkers; yes, he had two. The London Silver Vaults. The British Library, which has five huge subterranean floors. Likewise, the British Museum has storage areas underground. And then, yes, there is the fascinating history of the London Tube, including a closed subway station, still waiting for riders to show up.

""Secrets of the London Underground"" is produced by PBS and first aired in 2014. It is about 56 minutes long and English SDH subtitles are available. If you purchase it on disc, there are no bonus extras.

Very interesting!
