1033042,2,6305473420,"Wow. Gathering together miles of stock footage, using leftover sets and costumes, and with a narrator whose dialogue HAD to be written by Ed Wood (c'mon, NO ONE else could write like that!), this is one of the most stupefying flicks I've ever come across. The ""clipper ship"" has the most Freudian bowsprit I've ever seen (certainly nothing like those actually USED), but don't worry - nothing stays on screen for more than a couple of minutes. The pace is downright frantic - clipper ship, pirates, battle, wild kangaroos, sheep, period-costume ball, another ship, another pirate battle, burning ships, lost island, ""dinosaurs"", volcano, back to the original clipper. All in about 60 minutes! Yikes!
This one may be of some interest to older Detroit-area viewers because the co-star is Bill Kennedy. Bill used to host a daily TV afternoon movie (back in those halcyon days before everything was syndicated to death), trading in on his days as a B-movie actor. He also gets the funniest scene in the movie, when, after having a large (styrofoam) volcanic boulder bounce off of him, he lays down, tells Arness to ""take care of Elaine"", then jerks his head to the left in the quickest ""death scene"" I've ever seen. Worth the price of the DVD just to see THAT!
The dinosaurs? Sheesh - must have been used from somewhere else, because they look VERY familiar (in a cheesy Irwin Allen way). But they're just stuck in with less than 15 minutes to go, and have NO bearing on the ""plot"". Without them, this would have been a ""pure"" costume-drama. With them, hmmmm, not much improvement.
Not really recommendable unless you want to try out your skills as an MST riffer. (This would have been a GREAT show, with enough extra time for a short!) A bit faster paced than ""Lost Continent"" (what isn't?), which was made the same year, but LOOKS 30 years older due to the 1830's setting and relentless costuming, and nowhere NEAR the rewatchability factor. Worth a look if you can get it cheap just to see Bill Kennedy and his howler of a death scene.",1046995200,14,2034,4.716292134831461
1033043,1,6305473420,"I purchased this movie based on it's title and because James Arness was in it. The title sounded good and I have seen James in a number of movies from the 50's (e.g., The Thing, and THEM) so how could I go wrong. Well - the movie starts out slow, drags in the middle, and the prehistoric creatures (a couple of big lizards) don't even show up until the end of the movie. It will be hard for me to watch this one twice.",1001289600,6,418,3.988095238095238
1033044,1,6305473420,"Before making a career out of the TV show ""Gunsmoke,"" James Arness appeared in a series of classic 1950s science fiction films, including THEM!, THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD, and INVADERS FROM MARS.  TWO LOST WORLDS, an unfortunate mess, was not one of them.
TWO LOST WORLDS tries to be too many things at the same time; it has pirates, ranchers, melodramatic lovers, and intensely annoying ""cute"" characters like Salty, a dreadful walking stereotype who's supposed to provide comic relief.  No one will complain again about Jar Jar Binks from STAR WARS EPISODE I after seeing this turkey.  The DVD's packaging promises ""Prehistoric Time's Most Awesome Spectacle"" and shows two dinosaurs slugging it out.  We do see lizards that are supposed to be dinosaurs about 45 minutes into the film.  They may be onscreen for about 2 minutes tops.  Not exactly truth in advertising.
Image Entertainment has been releasing DVDs of old curiosities to cult fans for a couple years now, and largely I've been glad of it.  TWO LOST WORLDS, however, has nothing to offer to even film fans who believe in the old adage ""this is so bad it's good"".  The movie is barely an hour long -- a scant 61 minutes -- and offers no special features outside of a list of other James Arness movies.  Consider carefully whether you really want to spend the dough on this film.",969667200,22,1340,4.766233766233766
1033126,1,6305473420,"Filmed at Red Rock Canyon State Park - Highway 14, Cantil, California, USA, the South Seas has some pretty strange desert plants.

It's 1830. The clipper ship gets clipped by pirates. An Australian rancher's girl gets pilfered by pirates. The rescue ship gets dispatched by pirates. Pirates get replaced by dinosaurs as a threat. Dinosaurs get replaced by volcano as a threat. Will this ever end?

Even though this film has popular actors like James Arness in several popular themes with borrowed footage from other films you will still be glad that there is a fast-forward button.",1404777600,,581,4.979381443298969

1033128,1,6305473420,No really story to it. Could of been a pirate movie if they would of stuck with it. Si. Fi. with monsters no I don't think so. Cheesey  In between dialog like a filer on TMC. Roger Cormans worst is three times better.,1400457600,,217,4.046511627906977
1033129,1,6305473420,"The cover for this movie is VERY misleading. If you've come expecting a 'oldie' dinosaur flick, you won't get it.

The narrator seems to be the main character in this movie, as he has more lines than any other actor and goes into great detail about every little thing that happens when it IS his turn to talk. Its actually very poetic at times...but this is supposed to be a dinosaur movie, so i'm not here for poetry, i wanna see either; men in rubber suits or stop-motion monsters.
F.Y.I., you will get NEITHER, its lizards. Yup, 'giant' lizards.
And its quite clear that animals WERE harmed in the making of this film.

The fist half hour of this movie seems more like a pirate movie, being chased by them, having them raid the town, going after them and confronting them. In fact the main focus seems to be about that, as when they DO finally get to the island with giant 'dinosaurs' they never have any kind of discussion about how its possible or what they can do to survive.
Once they're on the island, its about ten minutes of nothing until the disappointing end.

Bottom line,
DON'T get this!
Want a dinosaur movie? Try one of these;
""The Last Dinosaur"" -rubber suits
""The Crater Lake Monster"" -stop motion
""The Beast of Hollow Mountain"" -stop motion
""The Valley of Gwangi"" -stop motion
""The Land That Time Forgot"" -puppets
""The Land Unknown"" -rubber suit, puppet, and only 2 actual 'giant lizards' (still better than THIS abomination)",1392422400,,1444,4.6328125

1033133,4,6305473420,I enjoyed the movie. I really like these kind of movies. A trip through time with prehistoric dinosaurs. There is some adventure till they get to the lsot world.

1033134,2,6305473420,"BOTTOM LINE: If you can score this flick for a few bucks then it's very, very marginally recommended - more for morbid curiosity's sake than anything else. Otherwise my advice is to forget it. There are much better dino-themed 'B' movies out there which are truly deserving of your attention. This ain't one of 'em. 2 STARS

THE STORY: 2LW is truly strange concoction. The majority of the film is a Colonial era/sailors & the sea/love triangle potboiler which, for no good reason, inexplicably has our ragtag heroes & heroines shipwrecked on a dinosaur-infested island during the film's final reel. Laughable ""mastodon""(?!) fight sequences consist of a baby alligator with a glued-on Dimetrodon fin & a striped lizard hissing, snapping and wrestling around. Yes, it's the same old dimestore F/X trick we've been tortured with in several other bottom-of-the-barrel dino-flicks; ""King Dinosaur,'' ""Lost Continent"" and ""Robot Monster"" among them. To add insult to injury there are interminable amounts of pretentiously written voice-over exposition. You know the kind, where an overly hammy voice actor enthusiastically describes what we're seeing on screen and tries to make everything seem far more exciting or important than it really is. Meh.

THOUGHTS: Not much to offer thunder lizard fans here with this anemic entry in the time-honored ""man encounters lost world of dinosaurs"" genre. The two damsels in distress are beautiful to look at, but weak and decidedly UNfunny comic relief characters and an annoying child actress offset that lone positive. All the characters in this film are one-dimensional at best, but then again the film's stodgy screenplay & scant runtime don't allow for much character development. Gunsmoke's James Arness shows some spunk and does what he can with the tissue-thin script, but there isn't much for him to work with. (His brother Peter Graves had to live with ""Killers From Space"" on his acting credits, and our tough-as-leather Marshal Dillon had this cinematic bedsore to taint his resume'. We all have our crosses to bear I suppose.) On the plus side, the movie only runs a hair over 61 minutes, but often manages to feel much longer at times.

THE DVD: Video quality for Image Entertainment's home video DVD release of TWO LOST WORLDS is pretty decent, considering. Some pixelation IS present, but it's got fairly sharp focus and solid blacks & mid-tones. Audio is surprisingly strong & clear. No bonus goodies to be found here, just the feature film itself.",1241913600,2,2499,5.135135135135135

OK, you get what you pay for.  Awful.  Awful.  Awful.  Or maybe just boring, boring boring.  Where are the dinosaurs?  Where is the 'spectacle'.  Basically a pseudo western soap opera of the TV kind - that just happens to have James Arness lurking somewhere in the cast (definitely not 'starring').
