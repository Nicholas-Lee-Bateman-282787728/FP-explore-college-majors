489411,4,6302658624,"Someone really needs to put this movie onto DVD.  Rockula is a really funny 80's classic.  It ranks right up there will Teen Witch as one of the campiest movies of the decade.  This movie has all that goofy, cheesy charm that we've come to expect from 80's comedy.  This movie is so bad that it is good! I just love it.",1013904000,6,319,4.096774193548387
489412,2,6302658624,"Yes, it really is a dumb movie, but so what?  Not all movies are ""Gone with the Wind,"" or ""Titanic"" or the like.  Rockula has goofy characters and a nutty plot.  However, this movie does have one redeeming thing:  it has some kicking music, with a particularly wicked performance by Toni Basil called ""The Night.""  And, for those who find humor in such things, it's worth it just to see Bo Diddley in high top sneakers, biker shorts, a tank top, a yellow cape, and wire bats on springs waving around his head.
They evidently did not come out with a sound track for this movie, and that's a shame.  If there is a sound track out there, I hope someone lets me know where to find it.  I've looked all over the place, and have yet to locate it.
Who cares if the movie's dopey?  Watch it for the tunes!!!",1008720000,,799,4.245033112582782

489414,4,6302658624,"For fans of campy cult movies, this is a godsend.  Toni Basil as a horny vampire mom!  Thomas Dolby as a vampire-hunting coffin salesman!  Bo  Diddley as himself!  Not to mention the simple fact that this is an 80's  rock Vampire Musical!
Oh, man . . . no one would confuse this with a good  movie, but you can laught at it and with it.  The filmmakers were obviously  going for cheese, and they hit it right on the money.  Dean Cameron (with  his eyebrows in a supporting role) plays a sensitive vampire who's cursed  to fall in love with a girl once every century, only to have a peglegged  pirate beat her to death with a hambone every time.  Can he break the curse  this time?  Can he become the world's first rock 'n' roll 'n' rap  vampire?
So much to love here.  The songs, first and foremost: elaborate  production numbers of howlingly so-bad-they're-good 80's tunes and even  some that were *meant* to be funny and are.  Cameron's wise-cracking mirror  reflection, who may be the ghost of Elvis.  Cameron's bat transformation --  a two-foot tall, flatulent goblin.

I'm so pleased it's also on Amazon. Ridiculous, bizarre, profoundly and knowingly stupid and with a bunch of notable people leaning in a lot more than you'd think they would, Rockula is the best. The heartfelt romance between a centuries-old virgin vampire who turns into a farting midget at times and the stunning ill-fated beauty whom he has to protect from a hambone-wielding pirate is oddly affecting yet also asinine, and everyone seems to be having so much *fun*. The musical numbers are very, very special.

489770,5,6302658624,"If you want 80s cinematic cheese at its stinkiest, ripest, most moldy extreme, ""Rockula"" is the movie for you. Still available exclusively on glorious VHS, ""Crapula""...sorry, I mean ""Rockula"" embodies everything you could possibly expect in a movie produced by Yoram Globus (Experienced B-movie fans, you know what level of quality to expect!) starring a young Dean Cameron as a rocking and rapping vampire who gets the hots for Tawny Fer every 22 years, but never gets past first base because she is killed every single time by a pirate with a pegleg and a hambone.

Go back and re-read that last sentence and ponder it before continuing.

Ready?

Ralph (Cameron) is frustrated by this multi-century dry spell and seeks a plan to win the heart of Mona (Fer) which is simplicity itself. She's in a terrible band and is in a screwy semi-professional relationship with creepy Stanley (Dolby) who is way, way over-the-top here. Stanley is thriving in both the music scene (watch for much of Dolby's work here, like the haunting ""Budapest By Blimp"") and as a coffin salesman, dealing in only the most unusual futuristic coffins. Ralph thinks vampires are simply misunderstood (he loves garlic, and I won't even begin to tell you what happens when he gazes into a mirror) and decides the way to Mona's heart is for him to start his own band and invite her to the premier. He's an instant A-list celebrity and his band, Rockula, is suddenly the bee's patellas, despite his lyrics being a cut below anything by Bobby ""Boris"" Pickett (OK, anything except the ""Climate Mash"", anyway.)

I was thinking ""Well, this movie certainly isn't very good, but I'm not sure that's it's quite as awful as I have heard."" Then at around the 41-minute mark Dean Cameron began a vampire rap. In his underwear. And the crowd went wild. This was the turning point in the film, and one that ensured its greatness in the pantheon of terrible movies with terrible music. Lots and lots of terrible music. All this exacerbates Stanley's controlling jealousy and appears to make his wardrobe depart the plane of the odd bound for a whole different dimension. After Ralph explains to Mona in a graveyard that she's actually 422 years old and that she dies every 22 years before their love can be consummated, revealing the awful truth that repetitively ""you are killed by a pirate with a pegleg, wielding a gigantic hambone!"" Because Mona is skeptical, Ralph proves to her that he's a vampire by turning into an odious little monkey-bat hobgoblin for a few minutes; this does not have the desired effect on Mona.

I'm sure you didn't need my title to figure out which cast member owns a rhinestone-encrusted pegleg, but before everything is said and done there is a ridiculous twist designed to confound young (old?) love that sullies the name of Phoebe (Basil) who, of course, dances in a ridiculous black ensemble and despite her conspiracy with Stanley in a wholly unnecessary, convoluted, and illogical turn of events, is immediately forgiven, while Stanley gets to examine the future of cryogenic technology. I know what you're probably asking yourself: is there a fight scene involving Ralph and Stanley featuring hambone versus pegleg swordplay in which Ralph has to yell ""That was my mother you just boned!"" in a reference to his mom, Phoebe? Yes there is. You'd think the film couldn't end with a more upbeat theme than that, but that's where you underestimate the wily prowess of a Globus production: Elvis, or a vague approximation thereof, makes a special guest appearance with Rockula to close the film out. When I say vague, think ""Dean Cameron in a jumpsuit saying 'thank you very much' with a sneer"". Semi-related side note: Bo Diddley is featured throughout this travesty for who knows what on Earth reason. Just sit back and marvel at the casting.

If you want to see a truly ponderous piece of intentional camp from the 1980s, ""Rockula"" could not come more highly recommended. Pass the garlic.",1433376000,2,3978,4.859882005899705

For new viewers who didn't live through the 80's it might not be their cup of tea but for those of us who did, it's a trip to the past, and a great way to remember some amazing people who aren't with us any more.",1525910400,,387,3.9740259740259742

7828712,5,6302658624,This movie was such a part of my formative years. I never thought it would be available on anything but laserdisc. This just made my Dad's life. And mine. We named our cats after the main characters. <3,1518393600,,202,4.342105263157895
7828713,5,6302658624,"This is the most important Blu-Ray you will purchase this year. Till now, Rockula has only been available on limited release VHS and even rarer laserdisc. No official DVD was ever released. Now, 30 years after it was filmed (in '88 but released in '90), it is finally getting the royal treatment.

An instant cult classic, it captures the sound of the late 80's with club-rock numbers, hair band blues covers, over-the-top power ballads, dance-pop, and even some Thomas Dolby thrown in for texture. Truly unforgettable not just for its ridiculous plot, hilarious gags, incredible cast, and out of this world costume design, but for the tender love story at the heart of it, Rockula is a unique film that you will find yourself watching multiple times.",1515542400,5,751,4.913385826771654
7828714,5,6302658624,I have loved this movie since I was a child. I used to have it on a home recorded VHS tape so the quality was usually pretty fuzzy and deteriorated with age. This is the highest quality I've ever seen this movie in. I love it! Just wish I could find it on DVD!,1514505600,,260,3.8333333333333335

7828716,5,6302658624,This movie is hilarious. Super safe (I would watch it with my parents and not have any cringe-y moments) and fun movie that's actually somewhat of a musical. Its campy with a silly story line but its really watchable. Plus Tony Basil.,1508457600,,234,4.595238095238095

7828718,5,6302658624,"This is a fun, mostly clean movie that you can actually watch with your kids!  Well, Bo Diddley in tights might scare them a bit too much but other than that, it is good comedy humor with less profanity than is heard on regular broadcast daytime TV now.  Personally, I think the the PG-13 rating could be lowered to PG.  For those of us in our 50'ish years, it is a good walk in the 80's, too.  Yes, I did mention Bo Diddley.  The Hall of Fame Blues superstar himself plays in the Rockula vampire band in this movie. He's a back-up guitarist of all things and he looks like he's having a blast.  Looking around in different scenes, you might see different 80's rock band one-hit wonder front men (or women) that you might recognize in street scenes and club scenes.  It is fun to check it out.  Even without all the hidden star power, the movie itself is just plain fun.  It is corny, but on the buttered side that tastes good.",1503705600,5,927,4.281609195402299
