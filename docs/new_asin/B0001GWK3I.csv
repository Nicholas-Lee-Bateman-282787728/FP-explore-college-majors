2000645,4,B0001GWK3I,"I hadn't heard of this science fiction classic, but that is what it is, a classic.  Oh it's not a Forbidden Planet or War of the Worlds, but it is thought provoking and good science fiction.

If you love 1950's science fiction then you should check this one out.",1351987200,,262,4.326530612244898
2000646,5,B0001GWK3I,"My brother and I saw this movie when it first came out, 1957 or so.  It was a thinking persons sci fi movie. the kind that gets the viewer to ask themselves ""What would I do"". after nearly 60 years, it still holds its freshness.  Give this classic a watch.",1347062400,,256,4.1
2000647,5,B0001GWK3I,"The 27th Day is a very intelligently done movie and it has a message that is still very relevant today. I only wish that our world's problems could be resolved by the cooperation shown at the end of the movie. We can still hope and pray for such cooperation as we are one world even with our diversity. I would highly recommend this movie to others. Although it deals with the Cold War, the basic premise of the movie is still very pertinent today.",1329436800,16,448,4.345238095238095
2000648,5,B0001GWK3I,"If you're a fan of 50's sci-fi this film is a must. I was delighted to see that the transfer is from an exceptionally clean film copy; although a small number of film flaws and jitter reveal that it is not a remaster. The disc is burned not pressed and the box cover shows just the movie poster from the time. However the transfer is so good that you can read the fine print in the ""newspapers"" whose front pages the movie shows. The movie reflects the anti-red, A-bomb dread and general disillusionment with mankind zeitgeist of the era. It also reflects hollywood's policy of using non-ethnic actors in foreign character rolls. The ""chinese peasant girl"" is only vaguely asian and has perfect make-up at all times. Admitting all this the attention to detail is delightful. The scientist characters all have badly fitted clothing. The sets are detailed and authentic of the time (which I grew up in) and the plot is pure good-vs-evil; refreshing in these morally ambiguous days. Also there's a twist-in-the-tail of this story that makes it more than B-grade. Well worth the cost.",1321574400,,1080,4.780748663101604
2000649,3,B0001GWK3I,"THE 27th DAY falls in the same category of anti-red science fiction dramas that predominated in the 1950s.  The communists were pictured as pure evil and the sci-fi theme was made to fit in.  Here, an alien who call himself the Alien (Arnold Moss) kidnaps five human beings and takes them to an orbiting flying saucer.  Speaking excellent English (Moss was a noted thespian), the Alien gives each a tiny box which contains two capsules.  These capsules are weapons of enormous power.  The idea is that he wants to see whether they will turn over to their respective governments the secrets of their destructive potential.  The Alien explains that his planet orbits a sun that will soon go nova and they need the earth in one piece for their population.  However, they have a Star Trek-like Prime Directive that prohibits them from direct interference.  But their morality does permit them to hand humanity the means to eradicate all human beings while leaving the real estate unscathed.  The alien stacks the deck against earth by broadcasting world wide the identities of the five.  One of them, a Chinese female peasant immediately kills herself rather than give up her capsules.  Another is a Russian soldier who is unmericifully tortured by his Kremlin bosses until he divulges his box.  The third, an English woman (Valerie French) throws her capsules into the ocean and arranges a meeting with the fourth (Gene Barry) with whom she conveniently falls in love.  The fifth is a scientist (George Voskovic) who dares not tell what he knows.  The plot focuses on the morality of the five vis-a-vis the pragmatic morality of the world's superpowers (Russia and America) who debate the ethics of using the weapon as quickly as possible in a pre-emptive fashion.  The United States chooses not to use it.  Russia intends to do so at the earliest moment.  THE 27th DAY presents a not so pretty picture of human morality.  Only the ethics of a very few can permit the world to go on living even at the cost of an altruistic race who could play tricks with morality to ensure the destruction of one species while assuring the survival of another.",1251936000,33,2142,4.806010928961749
2000650,3,B0001GWK3I,"This is a very thought provoking 50's sci-fi in which an alien gives five people from around the world capsules with which they can destroy all life on the planet Earth.  The catch is that the alien never mentions just how the capsules will destroy the earth so each of the five are left to their own wits in dealing with the ensuing adventure as others become aware that they possess these death capsules.

A nice intelligent effort with a twist ending that makes this one very worthwhile for 50's sci-fi buffs.  Makes a great double feature with Five, another intellignet and lesser known 50's sci-fi flick that deals with the Earth's end!!",1200355200,8,642,4.663716814159292
2000687,2,B0001GWK3I,"The movie is fine, but I wish sellers would more clearly highlight when the product is DVD-R.  Not all players can play DVD-R, and the quality is usually far from a true DVD.",1461801600,,174,4.2727272727272725

2000697,4,B0001GWK3I,"More like 4.5 stars. From 1957 we have an old movie that I had never seen! I know, I can't believe it either! What a terrific story, 5 Earth people are given the means to destroy the planet by an alien race that wants our world but won't take it. If the devices aren't used in 27 days by these people they are inert. The aliens have a trick up their sleeves though, they announce to the world who the 5 are and what they have! mean and bad aliens! One each in England, the U.S., China, Russia and Germany. Interesting to see how things were at the time of this movie. Great story, acting and just about everything.",1430179200,,614,4.168067226890757
2000698,4,B0001GWK3I,"This movie somewhat interesting.  It is mostly people talking about what to do with a deadly weapon given a few people by space Aliens. Five humans are chosen at random and given 3 small capsules that can end all life in a specific sized area one earth.  One goes to a Chinese lady, who kills herself when she get back to earth.  A british lady throws her's in the sea.  Gene Barry, who also acted in War of the Worlds, does a good job as eh American Newspaper reporter who has one set of capsules.  The Alien tells all tells them that after 27 days the capsules will no longer work.  The discussions are philosophical in nature and the final choice final choice on how to use the capsules is surprising.  It is a thinking SiFi movie with very little action.  It's not a bad movie and a bit slow.  What is the real secret  behind the Aliens and what do they want the humans to do?  Watch the movie.",1429315200,,898,4.223529411764706
2000699,5,B0001GWK3I,"A very insightful and perceptive plot concept, somewhat reflective of the ""man will destroy himself"" fears that flourished in the post-war 50's. I would compare this conceptually to The Day the Earth Stood Still. I enjoyed seeing the early Gene Barry, who would later become nearly inseparable from his role in War of the Worlds. The manufacturer of this DVD has embedded a ""copy protect"" which does not allow the disc to play on my joint DVD/VHS player (the one I use the most). I guess this is because this type of player is capable of recording. Despite this minor inconvenience, the disc played fine on another player.",1429315200,,622,4.768518518518518

2000702,5,B0001GWK3I,"Clearly influenced by the original ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" and clearly still stands up.

2000722,3,B0001GWK3I,"I bought this because I've been watching reruns of Bat Masterson and Gene Barry is the epitome of cool.  This was described as intelligent science fiction, almost an oxymoron these days.  Anyway, it probably was an intelligent science fiction piece back when it was made, but this would not have been made today.  All the optimism of man's ability for goodness would not have been filmed this way today and the notion that if you get rid of an evil ruler, all will be good is laughable.  If you get rid of en evil dictator in an oppressed country, another will take his place. I did like the film overall but it is just too dated to really be really enjoyable. Back in the late fifties, this would have been great stuff.",1401062400,,720,4.431818181818182
2000723,1,B0001GWK3I,"Ordered from Amazon - received DVD that didn't work - problem was I didn't view it immediately so by the time I discovered I had a bad disc they said it was too late to return - the customer is always wrong I guess. I somehow jumped through enough hoops to actually talk to a person representing Amazon ( in Pakistan or India I think) - told my tale and actually got them to send a new disc! This one looked OK, but again I didn't play it immediately and ...surprise! it didn't work either. So I'm stuck with a worthless disc and am just out the money. I do like this old movie, but I will have to find another source. I'd suggest you do likewise.",1396224000,,647,4.102362204724409

2000725,5,B0001GWK3I,Saw this movie in the theaters when I was a kid some 40+ years ago and have looked for it in video or DVD for years.

2000741,4,B0001GWK3I,"Five people are abducted by a space alien.  He tells them:  that he is from a nearby universe (star system), that their star is going to explode in 35 days, and that there is no world for them to move to.  Earth would be a suitable planet for them to settle on, but they would rather go extinct than to invade a planet with intelligent life.

However, they are well aware of the human penchant for warfare, of the human race's insatiable urge to develop ever more powerful weapons; that perhaps, the aliens could provide the humans, what they wish for, that is, an ultimate weapon, a device that leaves every structure intact, harms no lifeforms except humans, killing them within 1,500 miles of the designated target.  If, in 27 days, the humans use the weapons and exterminate the human race, then then aliens are saved. . . .

But there is something important about the weapons not told; will the humans discover the secret in time?

2000742,5,B0001GWK3I,"One of my all time favorite SCI-Fi classics!  A little slow at times but full of ""Peace and Love"" message thru out the movie.  I enjoy the aliens way of putting the fate of man into the hands of average people.  The actions of the leaders reflect the opinions of the 1950's and the cold war.  When push comes to shove, it is the basic good of man that wins out. So in a way, like ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" it carries the same message.",1367020800,6,440,4.022988505747127

8012466,4,B0001GWK3I,This review has spoilers. I saw this movie a long time ago. I still like it. There are a few quirks. 1. The people get the capsules. Immediately 1 throws them away and another dies. 2. The alien pretends to be benevolent but he is not. 3. The alien shortly after returning the people makes a world wide broadcast about their identities making them wanted people. It is still a good movie.,1523577600,,388,4.402777777777778
8012467,5,B0001GWK3I,"""The 27th Day"" is not a typical sci-fi movie. There are few special effects and no gargantuan monsters. It is a fairly strong social commentary about human life in the fifties that is applicable to every other decade. World domination, greed, fear, and other negative aspects of man's existence are highlighted. But also in the mix are intelligence, hope, and the ability to overcome the negatives. This film keeps you thinking about who will do what, who is thinking what, why would they?, or could they?...or is it just a game for the aliens from outer space?  I am reviewing ""The 27th Day"" from the Vintage Sci-fi collection, as I would rather review each movie separately on its own merits.
