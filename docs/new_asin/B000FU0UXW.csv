Price for DVD is reasonable and delivery time is as promised.
Images Quality of DVD is not as sharp! Looks like they have made DVD copy from a used Film.
This film message is that those people who live their life for themselves, will need a hired mourner after their death!
In Rajasthan, India  these professional mourner are called Rudaali, they get paid as per their performance in public.
Learn by watching this movie how poor people in small towns are been mistreated by rich land lords even today! in so called free India. Thanks.",1382227200,,595,4.5607476635514015
