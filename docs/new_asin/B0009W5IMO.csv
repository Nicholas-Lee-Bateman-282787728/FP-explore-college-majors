2326089,5,B0009W5IMO,"I have nothing to say but that this is another masterpiece from HBO! This is for anyone who has been concerned with their own upbringing, lost loves, safety of their own children, and running a business under the authority of who has the most money, and especially living in a small town in America. Enjoy!

2326106,1,B0009W5IMO,"Review for Empire Falls
Hot Toasty Rag, July 10, 2017

Empire Falls is a depressing town in which every resident has problems, and all but one of those problems are self-inflicted. The one exception is Joanne Woodwards crippled daughter who was run over by a car when she was a toddler. Its hard to feel sorry for anyone else in the town. Ed Harris manages a restaurant but cant get his head above water because wealthy Woodward owns everything and to cross her means ruination. So don't cross her! He cant express his feelings for his soon-to-be-ex-wife Helen Hunt, so shes going to marry someone else. Just figure your feelings out, and either fight for her or let her goits not that difficult! Helen Hunt is upset because her fianc&eacute; is significantly older than her, but he loves her and is great in the sack-a-roo. Get your priorities straight, Helen! Robin Wright Penn is a single mom drawn to mysterious, wealthy Philip Seymour Hoffman. Just say no and focus on your kid! Hoffman is miserable in his environmentso leave! Paul Newman is the town joke/drunk/mooch, but he wants to feel the excitement of being a young man again. Clean up your act!

Alright, my frustrations have been aired out, but I don't think Ive successfully steered you away from Empire Falls. Its incredibly depressing, and not in a good way. It was based off of Richard Russos Pulitzer Prize winning novel, so I kept waiting for the redeeming factor to enter the story. The three and a half hour HBO tv movie is split into eight chapters, and in the seventh chapter, something really bad happens. You know I never give spoilers, but the thing that happens is really upsetting and unnecessary. Its random and doesnt tie in to any part of the story, serving only to shock and upset audiences (and readers) and to gain Russo the Pulitzer Prize. Its terribly obvious thats why he wrote it, a reason thats not noble and, frankly, almost angers me.

Theres only one good part of the entire movie: In a flashback to a young Paul Newman, Josh Lucas was cast. Ive always thought Lucas and Newman looked alike, so I was very happy that Hollywood agreed with me, even only for a few minutes of a flashback. The story constantly flashes back to Ed Harriss childhood memories, and for most of the time, its boring and not very interesting.

I cant stress enough how terrible Empire Falls is. Please, please don't watch it. Its so incredibly upsetting, and for absolutely no purpose, that when it was over, I had to watch an animal documentary to comfort my mind before going to bed, for fear of nightmares. The story isn't deep or symbolic. Theres no greater good that will make you feel better.

I never give spoilers in my review, but if you're still considering watching Empire Falls, I urge you to read a spoiler. Then, if after reading it, you're still considering watching it, get your head examined.

Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to some extremely upsetting content, I wouldnt let my kids watch it.",1499644800,5,3027,4.691148775894539

2326117,5,B0009W5IMO,"Faithful to the Richard Russo Pulitzer Prize winner, this movie reaches in and pulls out values that we all possess. I felt the acting superb. The characters were played expertly by its all-star cast. I can't think of many movies (or books) that portray the human condition quite as well. Having seen this years ago, I then read the novel, and went on to read everything Russo wrote..I recommend this portrayal highly to anyone seeking a lesson in realism in a small sphere such as Empire Falls. It's struggles, meanness, triumphs and tragedy.",1489363200,,543,4.849462365591398
2326118,2,B0009W5IMO,"It's more like what happened than a story. Like I got up, I ate breakfast, I went to work, I came home.  I wasn't interested in any of the characters or really what happened to them.  The best thing I could say about it was that Paul Newman is still interesting, even though it was a bit part.  It might have been bore you to tears highbrow literature that I don't understand, but it probably was just mediocre.

I went back and forth between 2 or 3 stars - between 'I don't like it' and 'it's OK'.  2 won but if there was a meh, I would have chose that.",1489276800,,554,4.0
2326119,5,B0009W5IMO,"Interesting seeing Joanne Woodward and Paul Newman, husband and wife in real life, play such opposite type  roles--yet,, notwithstanding the extremes of their financial conditions, the roles were very much the same insofar as their manipulation and attempts at controlling others created such misery.  One victim of their controlling forces finally realized that the only way to stop their influence was not to stand up to them but to ignore them and take back the power that was his power.  It took decades but he simply stopped their evil influence by not allowing them to have any. That mental acknowledgement to himself set him and an entire town free.  That is the dominating lesson of this 2 part series.  People have power over us because we accept and acknowledge their power.  Ignore it and their dominion over us goes away.  Well acted.",1488844800,6,846,4.915492957746479
2326120,1,B0009W5IMO,"Boring, preachy, terrible script, and even the acting is awful! The script/story is incredibly unrealistic and laughably stupid.

Within a page-and-a-half I knew that Richard Russo, who was working at the college in my hometown, was describing my childhood surroundings. I love the book for many reasons but that's what drew me to it. Much of this movie was made in my hometown and the surrounding area. My sister, two nieces, and an old friend who is now deceased are in the movie as extras. The acting is superb, as always, from all of these amazing actors.",1482796800,,487,4.362637362637362

This story is not for those who just want to be entertained or want to escape their sad lives. It is a very good story about how to live successfully in a world with real tragedy and darkness. I consider it to be a classic tale on film, the best that can be done in this media. Think it is better received by the heart the second time watched, unless you have an old experienced soul.",1471046400,,551,4.2075471698113205

It was nice to see Paul Newman and Joann Woodward being their wonderful selves. Ed Harris's sexy self, Ellen Hunt has never been less than amazing in all the films and series she'd been in, she's always totally that role and so on and so on.

Its dry, very dry...Great actors list but just not much else..the story is unimpressive and I could not care less about its characters.
Really wanted to feel differently love the actors listed but its a no go.  And this from someone who loves older tv movies generally.
Thats my opinion anyway.",1469491200,4,515,4.457446808510638
2326137,5,B0009W5IMO,"I saw this miniseries when it came out on HBO and have been wanting to purchase it ever since; I finally got the chance with my Kindle.  I have not read the novel this series is based upon, but I know people who have and, by all accounts, it was excellent.  The HBO series continues the tradition.  The story (small dying town in New England full of ""characters"" all facing challenges, with one really bitchy rich lady - played convincingly by Joanne Woodward - overseeing it all and pulling strings wherever she can to cause trouble & keep people under her thumb) is very good, with each of the characters playing out his or her life story for the viewer in a carefully crafted way that inspires both sympathy and admiration.  It would take too long to tell every character's story, so I'll just state that the actors are all fantastic in their respective roles; the cast reads like a who's who of Hollywood, and they tell a beautiful & tragic story in just the right way.  Please rent ASAP if you want a great film.",1469404800,,1017,4.446236559139785
2326138,5,B0009W5IMO,"I first saw this when I purchased the DVD set.  It is a wonderful movie.  I looked for a long time to find it digitally but could not find it until a few months ago on HBO Now.  Now I see it is on Amazon for purchase and on Prime.  I am so glad it is available.

This movie has so many little stories with in it it makes it so interesting but not hard to follow.  You can learn to dislike some of the characters in this movie but still add a lot to the movie.

There are some major stars in this movie and all play their characters so well,  This is a must see movie for a lot of people.  I do not know many people who saw it that did not like it.  I would recommend this movie to people who are looking for something different to watch.  It is a definite must see.",1469059200,,765,3.778481012658228

This is a what? A sitcom?.  I guess it's a sitcom.  Full of big name actors and sets which re-create 1960s.
HBO must have spent some money making this.

2326140,5,B0009W5IMO,"I saw this on HBO in 2005 when it first appeared.  It grabbed my heart then - enough that when it came up on Amazon Prime my heart told me to watch it again.  It is about the emotional side of life and why we sometimes do things that seem odd to others, but make sense to our hearts.  It is about small town life and how some people make that work through their lifetimes.  For me small town life was left behind long ago, but I appreciate experiencing a story through multiple levels.  It is not easy to express this in a quick review but Empire Falls manages to flesh out the main character played by Ed Harris as he recalls his childhood, his mother, and people in his mother's life and give us an idea of why he quietly makes some decisions in his current life. The cast is deep in wonderful actors.  The story has depth and breadth. The setting is perfectly captured, right down to the letters on the signs falling off-kilter and the neon light shorting out.  It is a very well-done production - as HBO does so well.  I am really happy to be able to watch this kind of programming again.",1468022400,18,1092,4.216346153846154
2326141,3,B0009W5IMO,"Though I love the story line about the ordinary lives of ordinary people in an economically depressed small American town, my main question is why weren't any actors of color casted in this series. The American populus is a mix of cultural and ethnic backgrounds - blacks, latino-americans, Asians and native Americans are also part of the fabric of America. Why then is it presented in this picture as if America is an all-white nation? Overall the film has good credits. I'd give the miniseries a higher rating were it not for the obvious lack of diversity in the casting.",1467936000,2,574,4.75

2326155,4,B0009W5IMO,"I loved this mini-series, but....with one caveat.  Filled with consummate actors like Paul Newman, Helen Hunt and Philip Seymour Hoffman, and, best of all to my mind in this story, William Fichtner who is fascinating as the deliberately dumb cop, the movie moves right along until each appearance of Joanne Woodward in the pivotal role as the evil head of the empire.  Her performance was beyond strained, absolutely amateurish and embarrassing in this high level company.  Even Dennis Farina in the difficult role of the silver fox gives a more nuanced performance.  It is worth watching if you can grit your teeth as Woodward says ""dear boy"" one more time....much as Ed Harris does.  And though you want to throttle the character for his lack of energy, Harris carries the whole movie with his usual capable acting skills.  Watch Hunt or Robin Wright to see what good acting is.  PS when I wrote this review I didn't realize that this was Joanne Woodward's last role, and that she had Alzheimer's.  I would not have been so critical if I had known that.",1465344000,,1055,4.758241758241758

2326164,5,B0009W5IMO,"Love Richard Russo's work so much and wonder how difficult it is for the author to re-write his book as a screenplay, which is what Richard Russo did for this film.  It's a lovely piece of story-telling, acting and visual transfer from printed word. It is constructed as ""chapters"" with a voice-over narrator at a few selected points in the story. While I much prefer the book, the movie was an enjoyable adaptation with several of the actors deserving special attention for their fine portrayals, Ed Harris being one. The only casting objection I felt was of Joanne Woodward as the town power-broker and controlling force. I've never been a fan of Joanne Woodward's work and I don't think she was the right choice for this role either, but that is just one viewer's opinion and very likely a very small minority opinion at that. The only other negative impression my family and I had to this film was in the sound quality. A lot of the dialogue is lost to muffled sound quality with rather loud music playing over it. I'm not sure if the DVD has sub-titles, but that might be helpful if anyone is even slightly diminished in hearing ability. It's pretty hard to hear dialogue quite often in this film. This is well worth watching and probably re-watching, but I would recommend reading the book first, not because it's necessary for understanding, but because it's superior.",1443312000,7,1375,4.729166666666667

The acting is just so subtle and I loved that both Paul Newman and Joann Woodward got to play against type. Newman is pretty despicable and talk about ruthless, Joann Woodward did an excellent job. I can't say enough about Ed Harris, I've liked ever since the first time I saw him and he consistently delivers a fine performance.  Rounding out my picks is the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman who is just so wonderful.

Miles sees himself as a loser, and the other characters, while not pronouncing such a harsh judgment on themselves, really are not figures of human fulfillment. The novel has a certain pathos in it, but it really does not, in my opinion, delve very deeply into the characters' real natures..... their dreams, their pitfalls, their disillusions, their continuing hopes. Tick is the only one who appears to be dealing with her future, and the reader invests a lot of hope in her. Yet, Richard Russo is dealing with reality.... much of it on target..

2326215,5,B0009W5IMO,"This is based on the finest of Richard Russo's novels about small-town America, with well-developed characters woven into a rich plotline. It has everything: humor, heartache, romance, tragedy, small-town prejudice, heroes and villains.  This HBO mini-series actually did the book justice, and the casting was marvelous (Paul Newman, Joanne Woodward, Ed Harris, Helen Hunt, Dennis Farina, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Aidan Quinn, Kate Burton).  Re-reading the novel after watching the series on HBO allows you to picture those actors and actresses in their respective roles in the book.  Miles Roby yearns for the day when he can be liberated from his self-inflicted shackles: being stuck in a job he hates in a town he despises, being controlled by an arrogant, lonely, power-happy matron (Mrs. Whiting) who pulls all the strings in this little New England town.  It takes a tragedy involving his daughter Tick to make him realize that he can live out his dream by taking a risk, that is if he has the courage to walk away from Empire Falls.  His best attribute (being a better father to his daughter than his father and mother were to him) is what will lead him out of his misery and help him understand how the bitter betrayal of his youth cannot be repeated with the next generation of Robys.  The characters in Empire Falls are among the most colorful and memorable of the many entertaining ones that populate Richard Russo's novels.

The cast of Empire makes Russo's novel come to life.  Ed Harris as Miles Roby is just how you'd picture him.  Many memorable scenes by Joanne Woodward (Francine Whiting) and Paul Newman (Max Roby) add just the right amount of humor.  The other actors play their roles convincingly.  Helen Hunt's character reminds me a bit of Carol in As Good as it Gets.  Dennis Farina, Aidan Quinn, Danielle Panabaker and many others round out the cast and make this a truly enjoyable movie.  It is presented in Chapters, and at times is narrated.

I highly recommend this movie.  And, if you're ever passing through Skowhegan, Maine, look for the Empire Grill, complete with the indian sign out front.",1190246400,3,831,4.585034013605442
2326243,2,B0009W5IMO,"Sometimes movies measure up to books, as in Somerset Maugham's The Painted Veil. Sometimes movies may be even better than padded and chatty novels, as for example in Oblomov. But in the present case, the movie version of Empire Falls is all wrong. As one reviewer has already pointed out, the movie is too sunny whereas the book is dark, pessimistic, and sometimes despairing. The slow, maudlin music is distracting and misleading. The views are boring. And the pace of the whole thing is painfully slow and stupifying. The book has the depth of a Dostoevsky; the movie does its best to flatten and sentimentalize the plot and the characters. For example, an important aspect of Miles's personality is that he is a reader, and that's what he so much enjoyed in college: ""He hadn't been a college freshman for more than a few weeks before deciding that this was where he belonged, among people who loved books and art and music..."" (390) I can not figure out why this line was omitted from the script. Another one of the most moving passages in the book also fell flat in the movie. I am referring to Miles' thoughts after the shooting at the school, when he passed by his daughter and didn't see her at first. This is what torments him later: ""Wasn't there something in a father, he asked himself, some extra sense, that should've told him right where she'd be? Wasn't she his only daughter? A better father would've been able to find her blind-folded, in the dark, attracted by the invisible beacon of her suffering"" (454). Nothing of this eloquence, this richness, this love came across in the movie. Ed Harris, an actor I admire, was the wrong choice for Miles. He failed to portray Miles's depth, intelligence, and layers of insight and generosity. He just stood there, without a subtext, not knowing what to do with himself, how to bring this complex character to life. Of course, there's also the director who failed to see how slow and boring his production had become. Paul Newman, as Miles's father, was not half as crazy and wild as he should have been according to Russo's book, and Joanne Woodward was not half as evil as she is in the book. Only Helen Hunt, in my opinion, lived up to her fictive role. How disappointing! But most disappointing of all is the fact that Russo himself wrote the script for this production, which missed many of his own best lines; he also participated actively in its creation. Why? Why? I can't figure this out. Why did he choose to cheapen, simplify, and deaden his own great work? Was it a temptation he could not resist?",1189987200,9,2568,4.633771929824562

It is a multi character drama that takes place in a small town Empire Falls, Maine. In its center if Miles Roby (Ed Harris) who manages the local restaurant, ""Empire Grill"" that belongs to a wealthy and powerful widow Mrs. Whiting. The film concerns Miles's re-evaluating his life and searching for answers to the difficult questions. In his search, he looks back at his childhood, his relationship with his mother and the connection between her life and Whitings family. Miles also has to deal with the problems of those close to him: his father Max (Paul Newman stole the show with his performance as a prodigal father), his teenage daughter Tick, his ex-wife Janine, and many more.

2326247,4,B0009W5IMO,"I'm scratching my head, wondering what was lacking in this DVD for me.  The cast could not be better---each actor was wonderul, and Ed Harris, the lead certainly held my interest.  The story was interesting and worth telling, and it seemed good that they took their time in telling it---not trying to crowd a novel into a two hour movie.

The closest I can come to for an explanation of my lack of real enthusiasm for it is the tone.  It really tells a very dark story and although it's nice to enter into it with all the ordinariness of small town life, but it doesn't adequately prepare us for the really terrible revelations that occur later in the film.  I left it with the impression of all the nice folks together eating donuts at the Empire grill.  Perhaps it was the cinematograpy---just too much light and shots of the pretty New England town.  It was too uniformly sunny...for the dark subject matter. The development of the character depended on his digging into the darkness of his past and this was not adequately represented in the style of the film.

The main idea of the film was the development of the emotionally watered down grill owner (Ed Harris) who is obviously an underachiever.  We hear he got straight A's in school and went to college, which was unusual in that town, and yet here he is, working for the town Tyrant (Woodward) managing the small restaurant for the last twenty years with no end in sight.  He's great looking and charming but his wife left him for an obvious bozo.  His daughter begs him to stand up and stop the marriage but he's so nice and easy going that he just makes her promise to be a bridesmaid.  Perhaps, as another reviewer suggested, Harris is just too naturally virile and macho to play such a wimpy character.  (I loved him in History of Violence)

When he finally breaks out, he's not convincing either.  The fight with the cop is good and it's satisfying to hear him tell off the town witch but he still seems rather sappy to me....spending an awful lot of time hugging his daughter.  (If the characters in this story spent more time hugging their mates rather than their kids, they might all have been better off.)

The ending was not clear to me.  Does he go back to his really drippy ex-wife (Helen Hunt)?  and go into business with his mother-in-law?  (I'd hoped he would steal the cute blond waitress away from his step-brother.)

Another thought:  maybe it was the enormous joy that Paul Newman obviously took in playing his character that sort of spoiled the darkness of the film.  Shame on you, Paul!",1174608000,,2567,4.556768558951965

It has an all-star cast, it has a brilliant cinematic view to it.  It is brilliant.  It runs slow sometimes, some things get lost in it, as it tries to balance the outside world around Ed Harris character.

2326249,4,B0009W5IMO,"So, I finally caved and bought the DVD version of Empire Falls based off Richard Ruso's novel. And the first thing I have to say is that it was good. Not as good as the novel, but still good. I actually didn't know that Russo himself had written the screenplay. If I had known that earlier, I would've watched it a while back.

Fred Schepisi does a wonderful job putting the pieces together in the small New England town of Empire Falls. Almost every actor was dead-on portraying the characters from the book. Although, Francince Whiting didn't seem quite as evil in the film adaptation. I was especially in awe of Paul Newman's performance of Max Roby. He was by far the funniest (and the saddest when he needed to be) character in the film.

There seems to be something missing from the adaptation though. I can't quite put my finger on it, but it's there. I guess that's what you get from any film in which you've already read the book. It's lacking some of the little details that one can only explain in words.

Nevertheless, the film was wonderful. A young movie and book buff like myself can only hope for more film adaptations like this one in the future. By far, one of the best adaptations you can get your hands on.",1163980800,5,1226,4.44
2326250,5,B0009W5IMO,"HBO hired Richard Russo as screenwriter to turn his Pulitzer Prize winning novel into a TV film. Not only did he have the scope provided by television ( several distinct chapters, three plus hours) to represent the novel properly; he also ended up with a superb, really an inimitable cast: Paul Newman, Joanne Woodward, Ed Harris, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Robin Wright Penn, Dennis Farina, Helen Hunt, Aidan Quinn, and lesser lights whose day will come. What raw talent!

The result is fantastic. I've never seen a film that was so faithful to the novel that prompted it. (And take advantage of the screenwriter/director's commentary really to plumb the depths of this.) ""Empire Falls (the movie)"" is really the test case of the question ""Can a novel truly be turned into a film?"" And the answer is an emphatic ""YES!"" Although I read the book first, with my imagination turned on full force, I will never again be able to visualize the characters of Max Roby and the Silver Fox as anyone but Paul Newman and Dennis Farina.

An interesting side question, however: Did Russo realize things about the novel that he got to clarify when he was screenwriter in the film? I certainly thought so. It was suddenly clear to me that old Max Roby was the foil to Francine Whiting, and that the central question of the story was where and how a person determines to express love: The disreputable old charmer Max Roby made the decision to offer love where his ethics and commitment (however doubtful both of these were) told him to, whereas Francine permitted herself to wander away from love to embrace power and revenge. Maybe Russo was bringing out more distinctly what, as author, he knew was already there in the novel, but maybe he was simply realizing in the film for the first time what he had hoped to accomplish in the book (and this latter is what I for one think).

Thus, this film is simultaneously a best reading of the book, while also providing a new understanding of it. In any case, how could anyone do anything but recommend it enthusiastically?",1158451200,4,2050,4.704735376044568
2326251,2,B0009W5IMO,Talk about a depressing film.  Frankly this plays like a competition of which character has the most effed up life.  By the time we arrive at the school shooting-you feel like you need to duck from the kitchen sink being tossed into the script.  Even the excellent calibre of actors couldn't do more for this mediocre story.,1149984000,3,324,4.649122807017544
2326252,2,B0009W5IMO,"No, this was not the worst movie I have ever seen, but it was very disappointing, especially given the cast of fine actors.  I enjoyed NOBODY'S FOOL, a film adaptation of a Russo novel, but EMPIRE FALLS had very few moments of authentic emotion.

Hoffman, as the doomed lover of Miles Robey's (Harris) mother (Penn) does give a quietly affecting performance.  Penn is also affecting as the mother who swallows her dignity and sacrifices her chance at love for the sake of her small son.  However, these performances are not enough to carry the movie.  Harris, usually a strong actor, is curiously low-key, as though going through the motions of acting rather than actually acting, and Newman's portrayal of Robey's much-absent father is too farcical to ever elicit any sympathy for his character.

Perhaps the worst aspect of the film is the overly dramatic plot element of the Columbine-like shooting, which tips Robey's daughter over the edge and is supposed to provide the resolution of the conflicts.  I found such a devastating event to be unwarranted in a movie that, up until that point, seemed to be a satirical comedy about a disentegrating town.

Moreover, many of the characters' motivations are not effectively portrayed.  I also found the voice-over narration to be distracting, irritating, and out of step with the rest of the movie.

All in all, this movie did not raise itself above the quality of a Hallmark Hall of Fame Movie.  The movie is almost completely devoid of emotion, and it also lacks dramatic tension, making it mostly a dull experience with brief moments of charm.",1146700800,3,1595,4.914179104477612

2326257,5,B0009W5IMO,"This HBO adaptation had four things going for it that almost guaranteed its success before a single camera began rolling.

The first was the fact that it was based upon Richard Russo's award-winning book of the same name.  The second was that Russo himself wrote the adapted screenplay.  The third was the incredible, all-star cast; and the fourth was that it was an HBO production. Each of these elements contributes to a mini-series now available on DVD and one that is not to be missed.

Let's start with the story.  No one, absolutely no one, captures small town America the way Richard Russo does.  Unlike some writers whose only real acquaintance with this setting seems to be either a brief glimpse from the Interstate or, worse, some other Hollywood writer's impression, Russo writes as though he actually spent years in the former mill towns, sitting at the diner, the tavern, or the doughnut shop soaking in the lost dreams and dead-end futures that haunt many of the residents of these communities.  But unlike writers who see only despair in such a setting, Russo captures -but never makes light of- the small victories that the locals do grab onto to make life worth living.  Odd as it may seem to the Sacks Fifth Avenue set, it IS possible to have a fulfilling life without ever owning a Gucci...and Russo is the master of introducing audiences to such lives.  It is the audience's further fortune to have Russo acting here as his own screenwriter.  The tweaks, cuts and short cuts necessary to make a novel into a workable screen presentation were thereby handled lovingly by their creator.  He did not leave in too much, he did cut too much.  True, the mini-series format gave him extra room to work, but he did the most with it and the audience is the clear beneficiary.

The casting is spot-on.  Ed Harris plays the central character, Miles, with an easy grace that belies the fact that this is acting, while Paul Newman has a ball playing Miles' irascible and irredeemable father, Max.  Two other casting bull's eyes were scored with Philip Seymour Hoffman as the enigmatic Charlie Mayne, and William Fichtner as Deputy Jimmy Minty, a role that clearly anticipates his current starring slot in TV's ""Invasion.""  The rest of the cast is similarly perfect and there is not a bad performance in the lot.

HBO has shown time and again that when its name is on a production, the result is going to truly be something worth watching, even if the usual Hollywood glitz is not attached to it.  Instead of making a splash, HBO seems to be intent upon producing quiet gems, and that is what this film is.  Read the book, and then see the movie.  Or do it the other way around.  But whatever you do, do not miss this film.",1137888000,45,2730,4.645833333333333

Empire Falls is a small town set in New England where life is simple and everyone knows everybody. But for Miles Roby, a man who has been working in the same grill for most of his life, there's something missing. He feels that Mrs. Whiting who owns the grill has it in for him and he doesn't seen anything extraordinary happening in his life. He's been through a divorce and his ex-wife Janine is about to get remarried something his daughter Tick doesn't want to happen at all. Miles also has to put up with his senile father Max who thinks everyone has it in for him.

Miles frequently has flashback of his childhood when his mother was still alive and he tries to remember Charlie Mayne who he hates but he can't really figure out what happened to him. His daughter Tick is also trying to connect with a tortured boy who she tries to help but realizes he's beyond her saving. Miles also struggles with the feelings that Mrs. Whiting's handicapped daughter Cindy has for him. Miles is just a guy who doesn't think that he should be spending the rest of his life flipping burgers at the same old grill and he wants more with his life.

Empire Falls is driven by an all star cast of Ed Harris, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Paul Newman, Aidan Quinn, Dennis Farina, Joanne Woodward, and so many more. It is a heartwarming adventure and it is a must see.",1136592000,54,1602,4.402027027027027
2326262,4,B0009W5IMO,"EMPIRE FALLS is the HBO-produced version of the Pulitzer-Prize winning novel by Richard Russo. It boasts a star-studded cast for a TV production (Ed Harris, Paul Newman, Helen Hunt and Joanne Woodward) but then some of HBO's products exhibit better acting than many big-screen releases. I like EMPIRE FALLS. The first chapter or two dragged a little and I was debating whether to turn it off. But I hung in there, wanting, I guess, to see what happens to the characters, espectially Miles Roby (Ed Harris) who apparently has been stalled in life by some traumatic events experienced as a boy. As a result, he seems unable to get unstuck from managing the Empire Grill for the towns's richest citizen (Joannne Woodward). There is a bit of class struggle here (why is the ""evil"" character always the rich one?), but all-in-all it dealt with life in a small New England town fairly even-handedly. You may want to impatiently nudge Miles out of his funk as his friends do but his character is also symbolic of how many of us find ourselves stuck in life without an impetus for change. We all just don't have a powerful rich woman holding us in psychological thrall as an excuse. There is a fistfight between Miles and another character that is one of the most realistic fights I've seen on film: they actually hold their hands in pain after hitting each other on the head, which is almost never done in other film fights. That kind of attention to detail is exhibited throughout the film and can be credited to director Fred Schepisi. Mr. Russo wrote the screenplay. Paul Newman is a delight as Mile's undependable father(see him in NOBODY'S FOOL, another Russo book-to-film) and Helen Hunt is fine as Mile's soon-to-be-ex-wife.

2326264,3,B0009W5IMO,"Have not read the novel so cannot compare the movie to it. Nor did I grow up in that area so cannot relate to if that is how a town like that would be.

It is an o.k. film but left too many holes in the story and was too much of a story to tell in just those few hours. This would have been better as a several hour mini series.

Paul Newman is great

Helen Hunt does a good job but goes overboard in trying to create a ""Maine accent""...it stands out as she is the only one talking that way and that makes it even more annoying.

Theresa Russell...man does she look different from 20 years ago. Did not even know it was her.

All in all a typical story about lost dreams, inner demons, future hopes, etc.

Ending is rushed and since I was slowly being drawn into their world I wanted more of this movie. Do not think it a total waste of time and a not too bad way to kill a few hours.

Gets 3 stars but could have been a 5 star if a longer mini series.",1135728000,5,952,3.8512820512820514
2326265,5,B0009W5IMO,"For those of you lacking HBO, you missed this gem the first time around. Don't let it happen again. With a screenplay by the author of the Pulitzer prize winning author, Richard Russo, each word and scene resonates with just as marvelous novel.

First, the cast is superb. Paul Newman, havinf starred in anearlier film based on a Russo novel, saw the emotional tale in the novel, approached HBO, and had himself cast as the mischevious Max, father of the protagonist, Max Brody. Max, played to further perfection by Ed Harris, lost his once-fat wife (Helen Hunt) to the spa owner windbag, played by a cast-against-type Dennis Farina. Jaonne Woodward is the antagonist/villian, in a story that plays out against the backdrop of a crumbling industrial city in Maine. A manipulative matriarch makes life miserable for many.

Russo wrote much of the book in a setting, a decaying town in New England, and he admittedly drew from the lives of his own teenage daughters to flesh out the role of Tick, Max's daughter. Here too, Tick and her youthful colleagues play their roles very well. They play out the drama created by the adults, witness a tragedy, and allow the adults to come to terms after one more death.

The DVD version closes perhaps to quickly, and the classroom tragedy late in the film is a bit melodramatic. But there is not a minute that rings false. Watching the DVD on a cross-country flight left me wanting more than three hours.

Read the book. Check this DVD out. Enjoy them both.",1133308800,4,1496,4.7203065134099615
2326266,2,B0009W5IMO,"First off, I CANNOT BELIEVE the four & five star reviews for this muddled, confusing film adaptation of a brilliant book, set in a small town in upstate N. Y., by one of America's best modern day writers, who incidently, also wrote this horrible screenplay. Are we talking about the same Empire Falls here, or are all these reviews- PHONIES, written by HBO publicity hacks????!!!!
Mr Russo has demonstrated  to this writer / viewer he needs to stick with the book writing and leave screenplays to accomplished screenwriters, or at least cowrite it with one! Thankfully, I have read the book, and truly  needed the information from it, to make it through a movie filled with so many unanswered questions, unexplained characters & side stories left unexplained.......!!!!??/#*!%
At the finish of the film I spent a good deal of time explaining the plot and characters to my wife and five others who were viewing with us- as so much of this movie left people in the dark!
What a waste of a brilliant cast here also!
For a great film adaptation of a Richard Russo book, definitely try ""Nobody's Fool"", which also stars Paul Newman & the late great Jessica Tandy, heading a stunning  all star cast.
Additionally, I highly recommend reading any of Mr Russo's great books, some of which include : ""The Straight Man"", ""Nobody's Fool"" and ""Empire Falls"" ...

beginning, setting up some interesting characters in rural
New England life.  After Vol. 1, my fiancee and I were interested to see how the relationships would play out
in the second half.  Aside from the slightly over-the-top script given to Helen Hunt in part two, we were into the second half as well when the story took a left turn that was totally uncalled for and straight out of a stereotyped, prime-time drama.  After this event, the story fizzled, and the intrigue and interest over the relationships built up in Vol. 1 was never readdressed.  The film abruptly terminated in a silly manner.

2326277,5,B0009W5IMO,"""Empire Falls"" is an amazing production, nominated for an Emmy for best mini-series or TV movie.  The HBO mini-series is in two parts with four ""chapters"" on each DVD.  Australian director Fred Schepisi does an excellent job with the pacing in each segment.  He previously directed ""Roxanne"" (1987) with Steve Martin and ""The Russia House"" (1990) with Sean Connery and Michelle Pfeiffer.  He was nominated for a Best Director Emmy for this series.

This show has an amazing all-star cast.  The lead is Ed Harris as Miles Robey.  Poor Ed!  He's been nominated for four Oscars, three times in the supporting category [""Apollo 13"" (1995), ""The Truman Show,"" (1998), ""The Hours"" (2002)], and once for Best Actor for ""Pollock"" (2000).  He finally gets nominated for a Best Actor Emmy and doesn't win.  But his performance is intense as the responsible son who runs the Empire Grill.

The only Emmy the show did win was for Paul Newman who played the obstreperous ex-con daddy Max who bugs out for Florida on money stolen from the church cashbox.  Newman's career has included a long list of Oscar nominations for Best Actor [""Cat On a Hot Tin Roof"" (1958), ""The Hustler"" (1961), ""Hud"" (1963), ""Cool Hand Luke"" (1967), ""Absence of Malice"" (1981), ""The Verdict"" (1982) & ""Nobody's Fool"" (1994)] and as Best Supporting Actor for ""The Road to Perdition"" (2002).  He'll have this Emmy to join his Oscar for 1986's ""The Color of Money.""  He does an amazing job, both comic and dramatic!  My favorite moment in the series is when we realize that Max probably knows that David is not his biological son, but claims him without reservation.

As the wealthy town matron Francine Whiting, Joanne Woodward also has a long list of credits.  She won the Oscar for ""The Three Faces of Eve"" in 1957 as well as for nominations for ""Rachel, Rachel"" (1968), ""Summer Wishes, Winter Dreams"" (1973), and ""Mr. & Mrs. Bridge"" (1990).  She was nominated here for the Best Supporting Actress Emmy as the icy-veined wheeler dealer who manipulates the town's purse strings and the lives of many of its residents.  Her cat in the series deserves a special mention who should win a ""Meanest Cat"" award!

Helen Hunt who won her Best Actress Oscar for ""As Good As It Gets"" in 1997 plays Ed Robey's wife Janine, an insecure woman who needs love.  Danielle Panabaker from ""Sky High"" plays Tick their daughter.  It's one of the scariest sequences when a preoccupied Janine tries to drive away before Tick is all the way out of the car and drags her.  Philip Seymour Hoffman who was great as the runaway preacher in ""Cold Mountain"" was nominated for Best Supporting Actor Emmy as C.B. Whiting, the man who flees to Mexico and shoots himself in the head rather than live with Francine.

There are numerous other fine supporting performances.  Perhaps the most chilling is Lou Taylor Pucci who plays loner John Voss.  Pucci played another loaner recently in ""Thumbsucker"" with Keeanu Reeves and serves as the butt of local kids' jokes until pushed over the edge.  The Columbine-type ending seems to come from the blue, but Taylor is marvelous with few words.

Aiden Quinn from ""Cavedweller"" plays Miles' brother David.  Robin Wright Penn plays their mother Grace in the series' many flashbacks.  William Fichtner from ""Black Hawk Down"" & ""The Perfect Storm"" plays small-town cop Jimmy Minty who has a chip on his shoulder where Miles is concerned.  His son Zack is played by Trevor Morgan who also played the bully in ""The Sixth Sense"" and was in ""The Patriot.""  He does a great job of pushing John Voss over the edge.  Newcomer Delia Robertson plays Tick's friend Candace who gets shot in the art room.  Kate Burton who is doing a super job in her re-occurring role in TV's ""Gray's Anatomy"" as Dr. Gray, the alzheimer mother patient of the main character, and who will soon be in ""Stay"" with Ewan McGregor, Naomi Watts & Ryan Gosling, is excellent as the handicapped Cindy Whiting who has a crush on Miles.  Theresa Russell as Charlene, the stoned waitress, does a great job.

The cast is excellent in this mini-series.  The direction is excellent.  The metaphor of the Maine town ""Empire Falls"" where we watch the Whiting empire also fall is excellent writing and earned a deserved Emmy nomination for Richard Russo.  This 2-disc series is a treat & thrill.  Enjoy!",1128902400,2,4324,4.79054054054054

2326281,4,B0009W5IMO,"Yikes! I rented the movie because of the All-Star cast and the advertisement on television. Obviously this was an HBO series which I didn't see. If I had, I would just have been watching a repeat. But since I had never seen it and was expecting a full-length movie, I was deeply disappointed when the credits came up without a conclusion.

Because the end was left dangling, I can't give it five stars. What happened to the characters? What happened to the relationships? What happened to the hopes and dreams some of the people had?

Although the cast was superb, I also thought the story was VERRRRRY slow. I paused the DVD player a couple of times to do something else just to break the monotony. Cinematography was excellent and the story was refreshingly void of nudity and foul language, however, so that is the plus side of this DVD - along with a look at people in small-town America.

Sorry, folks, the book or the whole series may have been good, but if Hollywood is going to put a story onto DVD, they should put the WHOLE story!
