5562576,5,B00B83OIVA,"update: this entire series is now available in netflix instant streaming.

an inexperienced detective could pick no worse place to set up her first major case than this slice of new zealand which time seems to have passed by. not the least of this time element is that if men acted towards a woman detective the way these act towards robin griffin, moss, they all would be facing lawsuits, disciplinary hearings, etc., in 2013 USA. in short, the men on this police department would all be out of jobs based on rampant sexual discrimination and harassment.  but they only mirror this new zealand backwater as every male seems to have a good dose of violence in his makeup. griffin's terminally ill cancer ridden mother, just for one, gets beaten up by her live in lover on a regular basis.  that has to be a new low, beating up an older woman dying of cancer.  but these people don't make much of it, other than shrugging it off as just domestic violence as usual.

Rape also is a dominant aspect to the local crime scene. griffin herself was raped as a high schooler. her case involves a local underage girl who is pregnant, father unknown, rape unknown. this girl's father is the local drug lord.  we see him murder a real estate agent early on just for selling the land where his mother is buried. he flagellates himself at her grave regularly.

this is all incongruous though because otherwise the place looks like eden must have looked.  it is unbelievably gorgeous. another incongruous element is that women who are seeking a sanctuary move onto a large tract of land (the before mentioned burial ground) under the auspices of local guru Holly Hunter. this place seems like a hippie, feminist, counterculture commune. the locals hate the women who live here.

the series is directed by Jane Campion, who was Hunter's director on THE PIANO, for which she won the Oscar. the series was just screened at the Sundance Film Festival, the first time it has premiered television among its film entries.

as to what happened to the underage girl, that aspect just keeps getting stranger and stranger, utterly confounding our usual expectations.

give this a try.

5562587,2,B00B83OIVA,"If only there was a book I could read so I could find out what was going on!
The 'plot' is sketchy at best with huge gaps that never get filled; why does the evil patriarch self-flagellate, why does he feel he ""owns"" paradise, who is the baby's father, why does Tui's mother not have any role in searching for her or taking care of her later, how does this dumb cop survive when she constantly puts herself in thoroughly dangerous situations, who killed the teenager on the road, what the hell was going on in any of the myriad subplots?  Episode one and most of two pulled me in and I stuck it out to the end, when I became angry and disappointed. I honestly couldn't care less about any of the characters by the end. Any empathy for the 'heroine' was erased by her truly unbelievable stupidity. The overall impression is one of potentially intriguing characters and plot lines neither of which ever get developed leaving everything to the imagination. While this may have been the point, I did not find it enjoyable. Too much camera time spent on brooding expressions and very little useful dialogue. Some interesting sex scenes, some predictable deaths. Everyone in the town is sick, twisted, and more or less evil. Useless!!!",1436486400,3,1229,4.637614678899083

5562594,4,B00B83OIVA,"Nitty gritty reality of small town New Zealamd, where a lot of the rough locals work for a meth lab owner from Scotland.  The women are single mothers who wanted to escape the low pay and cramped living of Christchurch.  They do not want the upstart young police detective intervening with their livelihood or personal lives.

Local men are shown as very wild, always drinking, taking drugs or out fishing and hunting, always armed, violent, driving offroad vehicles and getting Maori tattoos.  At least, most of them seem to be very lowdown and of low income.

Our main protagonist or heroine is pulling just one thread out of this wool ball by investigating the suicidal pregnant 12yearold Tui.  Rescued from the big lake and questioned, the girl is then released to the wild Scottish father, then she disappears.  The chase or rather, police hunt, begins.

With lots of red herrings and side paths such as the detective's dying mother and her reluctance to marry her fiance, while an old high school boyfriend gets her straight into intense sex after 15 years away from each other, well as a viewer you may well complain that you cannot quite follow all the loose and extraneous ends.

I will not reveal all the plot twists and turns.  Suffice to say that the film
may really annoy a lot of people.  It is too darn slow and meandering for our modern sensibilities.  I confess I started writing Christmas cards with only one eye on the film because the kiwi landscape was not eye candy for me.  I live in Northern California;it looked familiar.

The scumminess of the local people in their dress, haircuts, foul language and amoral behavior can leave a viewer with a bad dirty feeling about life in general.  Their violence and drugs and drinking show the New Zealandrts as a desperately spiritually lost people. Of course these are the criminals and the USA is full of similar types incliding thr hippie women at the Paradise ranch living in containers.  So no offense!

I found the final denouement pretty disgusting and a surprise too.  That house of the police inspector looks just like Sausalito here near San Francisco.

But why was Tui a different race than her father and brothers?  Never clear.  She looked straight from Vietnam and I couldn't figure that out.  Adopted?  Did I miss something?

Was Mitchum lying about everything?  The movie ends with a lot of loose ends.

Nonetheless for the patient or for those who have some ironing to do or maybe knitting could get through this long series.

The women in this film let men do things to them.  They make themselves victims.  That is one reason the children suffer too.  Men cannot be controlled sexually. That is the clear message.  Never trust any of them.",1420675200,2,2723,4.729787234042553

A fantastic ensemble of actors and great story rounds it out.  I couldn't figure out whodunit, and the ending came as a big surprise.

5562601,1,B00B83OIVA,"I'm astonished this has been applauded by critics all over the place.  As a fellow Australian, I appreciate Jane Campion's catalogue of work, but feel that in this one, she definitely let the side down.  The New Zealand scenery is impressive.  But the plot lurches through yet another story of a vulnerable lady policewoman returning to the place of her roots to investigate a crime that brings back unwelcome memories of her past.  How many times have we sat through that?  Boring.  And Holly Hunter must have been hard up for a free holiday - or a job!  Otherwise why would she accept a (mercifully for the viewer) smallish part as a sort of airy-fairy guru presiding over a community of 'lost' women who apparently live in shipping containers?  Yes, it gets that ludicrous.  And I repeat, Holly Hunter's character comes over as ridiculous, particularly at the end where she heads off into a barren hinterland, dragging her luggage.  Where is she heading?  An airport?  The distant horizon?  I was just glad to see the back of her.

The 'mystery' isn't even that mysterious, or its solution any sort of surprise.  Elisabeth Moss does her usual good job, as do several other supporting players, but frankly there are better, more stimulating ways of passing - instead of wasting -  one's time.",1413244800,12,1294,4.787330316742081

5562604,3,B00B83OIVA,"I know I am in the minority, but I wasn't all that thrilled by this show.  It was very easy to figure out who the ""bad guy"" was and some other major plot points could be seen coming a mile away.  Elisabeth Moss and some of the other actors did a great job, but at least one actor mumbled his way through the whole thing so badly that I could barely understand a word he said.",1411516800,3,375,3.9210526315789473

5562606,1,B00B83OIVA,"This show is dreadful. It's full of unattractive actors and actresses, most of them downright ugly. Even the main character is a plain Jane. There's a commune of what El Rushbo calls femi-nazis, led by a supposedly mystical woman with long gray nasty looking hair, played by Holly Hunter. One of her flock is a nymphomanic who weighs about a deuce and a half and goes into town to the local bar, full of nasty looking losers, and slaps money on the bar for the first one to pick it up to come give her a good fuc king in 7 minutes.
The bad guy is a Robert Plant lookalike, with two Aryan brotherhood looking thugs for sons, and a 12 y/o daughter who is pregnant, which is the big mystery - who knocked her up.
There's also the obligatory puke scene, where the mother of the pregnant girl pukes when she gets the bad news. Why is it that every other show has to show someone puking? This show made me want to puke.",1405900800,2,913,4.222857142857142

5562611,5,B00B83OIVA,"When I first ordered this BBC series, I had some trepidation due to the product description.  It sounded a lot like BROADCHURCH, which I had just watched and enjoyed.  Luckily, it turned out that TOP OF THE LAKE was a lot more mysterious and moody in its presentation - something I happen to particularly enjoy.  Straight-out cop dramas don't hold a lot of interest for me, just to give readers an idea where this reviewer is coming from.  So I was particularly intrigued with the character played by Holly Hunt - an enlightened but somewhat gruff ""guru"" who was being followed by a group of ""damaged"" women who had come to the little town of ""Paradise"" in an attempt to heal mind, body and spirit.  I found this segment of TOTL to be the most interesting, so I was a bit disappointed that it seemed to garner the least amount of screen time.  But that aside, Holly Hunter & the other band of misfit women brought a real spark of philosophy to the show that raised it a notch above most of its ""competitors.""

The plot kept the viewer guessing from moment to moment - the crazy ""hillbilly"" father, his two drug-dealing sons, the missing girl's gay friend - the cast of characters was diverse and refreshingly unique.  Something the BBC can excel at.  I actually found the lead investigator to be the least interesting character of all.  Despite the sympathy which was built for her, and the ways in which she mirrored the missing girl's life history, I just found the character to be flat - but luckily the story held together in spite of that minor flaw.

To avoid spoilers, I'll simply say that the story is intense, gripping and well-plotted and well-paced.  The music was exemplary - adding an element of mystery and sad overtones, similar to the unforgettable score from the old US series, TWIN PEAKS.  In fact, I found TOP OF THE LAKE to be similar in mood to Twin Peaks throughout - so if you are a fan of TP, I'm pretty sure you will find TOTL right up your alley.

Performances throughout were excellent, and my only regret is that the series seems to have come to a final conclusion - all the loose ends tied up nicely, so it doesn't look like there will be a second season unless it takes off on a completely different storyline with different characters.  Overall, Top of the Lake is moody, mysterious and haunting long after the end credits have rolled.",1403395200,6,2366,4.534117647058824

The young teen disappears and the search for her begins a process for Robin (Elizabeth Moss) to uncover her own past with the town and the under lying culture of it's inhabitants.

-
-
-
-
Don't read if you don't want spoilers

1)  It's okay to have sex with your sibling, as long as he covers his body with a lifestory of tattoos that he'll unveil for the female audience every episode.

2) if someone is depicted as the most evil, heinous villain in the first episode, wait for someone else to get that reveal later.

3) If you're gay in this town, spend less time dyeing your hair blonde, and more time on mountain climbing lessons.

4) If you give Elizabeth Moss a gun with a full load of bullets, plan your teen roofie party for *after* she leaves town. Duh.

5) If you're a female resident of Laketop, you can turn a blind eye to decades of teen abuse, while Elizabeth Moss fills all the men with bullet holes.

Once again, Jane Campion has brought us to New Zealand where a young girl has disappeared from her ""family home"". Elizabeth Moss is brought on the job, and plopped in the midst of a rather suspect police department, a town full of quirky and creepy citizens and a past that won't let go of her.

I loved the cast....who were not only well chosen but displayed superb acting skills-especially David Wenham and Robyn Nevin. Some of the dialogue was hard to hear- mumbling etc and too softly spoken to catch what was being said. Still the plot, which twists and turns- mostly on the tortured Moss, moved along at a good pace. I wasn't sure why Holly Hunter was in this piece, and some of the scenes with the women's ""village"" seemed pointless to me.

There is a lot to ponder in this series, and I kind of hope that there is another one. So much to explore about our fragile human psyche and condition. I didn't love it, but I liked it a lot, and appreciated the clever plots and good cast.",1393977600,,1134,4.369668246445498

What I would add, however, is a heads-up to gentle viewers. There are some very disturbing scenes; I am thinking of one in particular which my husband and I both considered to be not only shocking but gratuitous. Overall, it is a dark mystery -- slowly evolving and disturbing on a number of levels (and meant to be disturbing and thought-provoking).  Its not simply violence that is shown (though there's plenty of that) but a deep, poisonous inhumanity that pervades the action. It reminds me of a troubling dream sequence when the shadow of the unease that the dream inspired carries over into the next day.  There are no clear boundaries here -- it's not a simple hero versus villain scenario.  Everything is blurred and somewhat distorted as our protagonist detective (played so well by Elizabeth Moss) wanders through this strange sequence of events.

5562644,4,B00B83OIVA,"Every Jane Campion film or television project is worth seeing because of her intelligence, her political commitments, and her remarkable visuals; every one of them also has major flaws compounded by Campion's heavy-handedness with her messages. This recent miniseries produced, co-written, and co-directed by Campion is no exception to either rule: set in her native New Zealand, it involves a stunningly dramatic and mysterious setting, a mystery centered upon an atrocity committed to a beautiful girl, a determined detective trying to root out the truth, and a community around the victim that is involved in far more horrors than the detective ever dreamed. The parallels to the Danish TV show FORBRYDELSEN (THE KILLING) and to TWIN PEAKS (which also inspired the Danish series) are inescapable, especially given in how both those earlier shows matters of gender and violence stood front and center. Campion, of course, is one of the most intriguing feminist film directors in the world, are her analysis of violence committed against women is even more front and center than in its predecessors. In this miniseries, a 12 year-old girl, Tui (Jacqueline Joe), is found trying to walk into a great lake on New Zealand's South Island, and when she is rescued, it is discovered she is pregnant, but she refuses to name the father to a detective (Elisabeth Moss); soon after, she disappears entirely. As the detective becomes obsessed with finding this young girl, she runs up against an odd mixture of the lake's inhabitants: the girl's father (Peter Mullan), a violent and self-pitying local criminal patriarch; his son, the detective's former boyfriend, who comes to care for her; and an odd New Age community of women led by an androgynous, taciturn guru (Holly Hunter).

Campion's trademark gorgeous visuals and dreamy pacing kept me through the entire miniseries, and its really something to see, with the alien landscape of New Zealand's stark Lake Wakitupu and its nearby dramatic neighbor Mount Earnshaw. Some of the most remarkable shots are of helicopters, showing the landscape dwarfing the insectlike people crawling on it, or reducing the colorful stacked railroad cars of the New Age community to the scale of mere children's blocks. Whether the miniseries works as an actual narrative, however, is another matter. The mystery itself isn't very interesting and is fairly guessable, as is the big twist in the final episodes; there's also too much revenge fantasy, with nearly every rapist (the miniseries is fairly crawling with them) implausibly shot or maimed by story's end. Of the major actors, Moss and Mullan do the best work. As the detective Robin, Moss is very different here from anything we've seen her do before, and her quiet ability to assume command is nicely done. Mullan is ideally cast as a terrifyingly mercurial man who wallows in self-pit and who can be surprisingly tender before erupting into cruelty: one of the best (and scariest) bits in the show is a long sequence involving Mullan's tryst with one of the women (Robyn Malcolm, in a warm and fine turn) from the compound. Although Holly Hunter does excellent work as the guru GJ, and can strikingly evoke her character's air of electric quietude, she's burdened a bit by her own movie star aura (a less well-known actress would probably have suited the part more effectively). Jacqueline Joe has an unearthly beauty as Tui, but perhaps no child actor could have pulled the part off convincingly: the mirror of GJ at a different age (willowy, prophetic, and surprisingly tough), Tui has so much symbolic weight freighted onto her by Robin and the film alike that she struggles under the burden of it.",1389398400,,3690,5.069078947368421

All of the ingredients were there.  However.....  This should have been a 2 hour movie.  In stretching it out so much longer than that, the creators added so much that was unnecessary.  Unnecessary scenes.  Unnecessary characters.  And for the entire middle stretch of the series, nothing of substance actually happens.  In essence you could watch only the first episode and the last episode, and not miss much of importance.

An example.  The gathering of women at ""Paradise"" adds absolutely nothing to the story.  If that entire aspect were cut, not a darned thing would change.

The main character, the detective played by Elisabeth Moss (who did a good job), spends most of the series fumbling around without learning anything of use.  It is almost maddening how little of substance actually occurs during all of those investigative hours.  And when we finally, finally discover who the bad guy is, we realize that not one single thing that happened in all of those hours actually led to the discovery.  The discovery occurs simply by happenstance.  There is nothing logical or developed about it.  It is tacked on to the ending, leaving the viewer very unsatisfied.",1387238400,8,1320,4.977064220183486

5562655,5,B00B83OIVA,"And I'm not talking Jane Campion, the writer and co-director, and the creator of The Piano, for which Holly Hunter won the Oscar. Holly is back in a far different guise here, but a fascinating character, as are so many in this seven-part, strange mystery. Campion tends to deal with sexual issues with an iconoclastic view. Things are a little more normal here, but still outre.

But the Jane I'm talking about is Jane Tennison, the riveting detective in Britain's Prime Suspect series. I think the Elisabeth Moss detective could eventually be trotted out again in another case. That might not be a good idea, as that might threaten the relationship that develops in this series, a gorgeous romance. But for my money, the character is one of the first interesting female detectives in a long time. Apparently, no one seems to know how to do them like those from the British empire.

Interestingly, Moss is an American; I can't tell if she has any ties to New Zealand. Yet she seems to have a flawless accent, or, that is, she delivers her take on it flawlessly; her lines are not self conscious, they just flow from whatever this accent is that she has developed. It would be interesting to know how many of the other actors don't have natural New Zealand accents, or some history with them ... a quick trip to IMDB could solve that, of course, but these days, it seems you don't have to be British or Australian, or American, or even a native speaker of English, to work all over the globe. Moss, the secretary-turned-copywriter in Madmen with the improbable hairdo, really gets to let her hair down here. She has something of an interesting curriculum vitae if you view a profile but personalities aside she seems to be quite an actress.

I basically loved the series ... and did not find the stuff about the women finding solace on drug lord Matt's erstwhile land jarring. It was funny, but maybe some comic relief was needed. It also pretty much all hung together, some parts coming back on each other with beautiful irony. I think if you are a Prime Suspect/Law & Order fan, you'll like this one.",1370649600,6,2101,4.627345844504021
5562656,5,B00B83OIVA,"*** spoiler alert ***

Top of the Lake is a unique and captivating mini-series that offers great writing, acting and direction, and a fantastic setting.  At first glance a crime drama, it defies genre conventions, but the tip of the hat to the horror genre in the opening sequence and music is not to be ignored.

Make no mistake; Top of the Lake is about New Zealand.  Any local will tell you that New Zealand is Paradise; Top of the Lake tells us about the dark side of that paradise.  Yes, there is an Appalachian (for example) version of this story - but this is a distinctly New Zealand story.

Top of the Lake is a portrayal of New Zealand culture and its problems as few other films or series have done.  ""Once Were Warriors"" is a notable exception, and it is no coincidence that that film also deals with issues of misogyny, violence, rape, teen suicide, child abuse and child molestation.

There is a lot of feminism in Top of the Lake, but it is New Zealand culture that is indicted, and men and women are both guilty.  There are many victims in Top of the Lake, but there are few innocents.  Women seem to limit their sins to denying, defending and otherwise enabling the behavior of men, and the dark side of the culture in general, but Top of the Lake wants us to question whether they are any less guilty.  We probably see this most clearly in Campion's main character Robin Griffin, played by Elizabeth Moss.

There are many good reasons to like Robin, and to identify with her.  But the viewer suspects Al Parker (David Wenham) early on, and grows uncomfortable as Robin fails to follow up on some fairly clear warning signs, especially when she blacks out and wakes up in his bed and clothes, but fails to have a rape kit done, or a blood test, or to do anything more than give Al a light questioning.  She has suspicions, but she fails to follow through on them.  It begins to resemble the denial and willful blindness that is so much a part of the local culture, and a strong theme of the series.

Robin continues to get drunk in bars filled with overtly misogynist men, including one who actually raped her as a teenager.  She rekindles an old relationship with an old flame, Johnno (Thomas M. Wright) in a no-means-yes moment in a pub toilet.  This old flame had abandoned her at a high school dance just before she was raped by four drunk local men.  He comes clean about being there, but refuses to deny planning it with them ahead of time.  She continues seeing him.

When the local drug lord, Matt Mitchum (Peter Mullan), the most obvious villain of the series, reveals to her that he is her father, and that her lover is therefore her half-brother, we feel her horror as she realizes that many of the local demons are inside of her as well, and have been all along (Al has DNA testing done, and reports that Johnno is not Matt's son.  However he also reports that Tui's baby is Matt's, almost certainly a lie.  We never know for sure).

As ugly as this all might sound, I continue to have a lot of sympathy and patience for Robin, as do most viewers I think.  Credit this to the acting of Elizabeth Moss, but of course Campion knows that it is important that the audience care about even such a deeply flawed character.

Campion may have less patience for Robin than we do.  GJ, the reluctant ""guru"" of Paradise, played by Holly Hunter, is inspired by the late Indian philosopher U.G. Krishnamurti, a friend of Campion's.  GJ has no more patience for Robin than for any of the ""crazy bitches"" living at Paradise.  Robin is apparently the ""crazy bitch"" that broke the camel's back, sending GJ off to Reykjavik, about as far from New Zealand as a person can get.",1370563200,50,3686,4.451564828614009

From the first confusing episode to the last, I was hooked! This is one of the better mini-series I have seen.

'Top of the Lake ' is a seven-hour miniseries from filmmaker Jane Campion. Elisabeth Moss is a troubled Sydney cop investigating the disappearance of a pregnant 12-year-old in her small New Zealand hometown. This is a crime series concerned with heartbreak.  Moss's detective Robin Griffin is investigating the disappearance of Tui. Her father is Matt Mitcham, played by Peter Mullan, a Scotsman introduced as a villain. He is a drug taker, maker and rounder and owns the town.

There's a lake where the mountains should be, and green, green grass. Everything is topsy-turvy: An unborn baby is called a ""time bomb,"" a gentle elder-care companion puts his fist through a wall. And around the investigation is a group of scarred women camped out on land called Paradise. Holly Hunter's GJ, gives advice, sips soup and drops truth bombs.

This is a police procedural like no other. The only ethical investigator, it seems is Elizabeth Moss's character. All s not what it seems, and the finale will leave you surprised.

5562659,4,B00B83OIVA,"It seems. for my money, that TV series have gotten so much better over the years. Better writing, acting, directing that have all been bolstered by better budgets. The proof is in the pudding here.

Here's the scoop. Robin Griffin (Kate Moss) is a New Zealander who moved to Australia, became a police detective, and has moved back to New Zealand. She's on a case where a 12 year old local, Tui, has disappeared. Is she dead? Is she hiding? Dad is a local heavyweight with fingers in the drug trade. Robin needs to solve the case as old ghosts and local corruption rear their heads.

This is a great mix of clever scripting and atmosphere. This particular area of New Zealand, and the season in which it is set, give it an almost otherworldly feeling. It's so remote and desolate that a foreboding cloud hangs over everything. Yet there is a certain beauty to it that is undeniable. The viewer is up in the clouds of some other planet. The situation is well realized and gets increasingly more scary as the characters develop and the histories between them begin to bloom. All the elements of the script are meted out evenhandedly and in subtle fashion. I felt as though I were watching things happen as opposed to being told they were happening. The music and sound design were also very good. They underscored the loneliness and remoteness of the place and the lives of those living there. And the plot is really good. You think it's all over and then there's that little something Robin sees that says it isn't.

Jane Campion has been at it for years. She wrote and co-directed this and, for my dollar, she's at the top of her game. The only aspect of this I didn't care for was the Holly Hunter character heading up the women's commune. As you learn something of her in the final episode I suppose it makes sense. I merely found here annoying. But, that being said, this is about as good a series as I've ever seen on TV.",1368748800,4,1925,4.478632478632479

Literally. On your left, however, nothing is as it seems.  Everyone harbors a secret, some inner darkness, some seed of madness or corruption or evil.  Even the most innocent are caught up in whatever malevolence permeates the freezing waters and the chill air at Top of the Lake.

This is David Lynch on steriods.  The story covers 9 of the 7 deadly sins, every major vice is present and accounted for, nobody is who you think they are and just when you think you have someone pegged, you don't.

Edgy and disorienting, the plot centers around the pregnancy and disappearance of 12-year old Tui Michum.

A specialist in crimes against children, Griffin is asked to investigate the case by her friend and former mentor, the  the local top cop affably played by David Wenham. Holly Hunter plays a small but key role as a genuinely wise and down to earth guru to a bunch of women who end up at the Lake because they pretty much have no place else left to go.  The entire cast is excellent, particularly Jacquine Joe as Tui, and Peter Mullan as Tui's father, Mack, by turns charming, vicious, monsterous and frequently all too human.

Where is Tui and who fathered her baby? That's just the beginning.  The lake harbors many secrets and a couple of red herrings.

The main story is interesting but lacks suspense, mainly because of the subplot of the Paradise property and the troubled women camping on it.

The main purpose of this subplot seems to be to stretch the show to be a 7 part series, when in fact there is only enough material for about 4 parts.
In addition, there are many unnecessary details which don't add much to the character development and don't give any clues to the mystery either, and in fact only take away from the suspense.

5562663,2,B00B83OIVA,"As crime drama and mystery, this series starts well, with an excellent cast of idiosyncratic and well-developing characters as well as a darker if beautiful portrayal of what has become a popularized Middle Earth.  Unfortunately the crime and mystery become somewhat derailed by Campion's decision to devote most of the latter half of the series to romantic and existential explorations which detract and distract from the series' initial identity and story-thread.  Plus the fundamental impediment to the evolving romance is summarily dismissed at the end by what can only be characterized as contrivance.

On the plus side, the acting is excellent, as is the cinematography, direction and production values.  Thus, even more unfortunate that Campion cannot successfully or fully integrate the disparate elements of the series' distinct storylines, but instead chooses to focus on crime and mystery at the start, then shift the focus towards an emerging relationship in the second half, at the expense of the former.  The result is what could have become a series on par with Bron/Broen, Forbrydelsen, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, or Baran bo Odar's The Silence, but instead awkwardly becomes several stories clumsily separated and only marginally cobbled together at the end.  As for the ""Paradise"" setting/metaphor, it remains marginalized and enisled throughout.

5562665,4,B00B83OIVA,"NO SPOILERS:

I contemplated on how I could, sans spoilers, give a review on a 7-part mini-series as complex in nature as ""Top of the Lake"" (TOL).  I decided that I would comment on the imagery, performances and try to put in some perspective re: other programs.

First and foremost, kudos to Sundance.  There are an increasing number of good and unique programs coming from Australia/NZ that don't make it through conventional channels to the USA.  Apparently, Sundance co-funded with a sub of the BBC, who stepped in when ABC (Australian Broadcasting Company) pulled funding when an American actress (Elizabeth Moss) was cast in a lead role (I guess that it is OK for Aussie actors/actresses to work on USA produced programming, but not the inverse?)

The catch phrase for describing this series is the opening scene of a young girl (Tui - 1/2-Thai) peddling her bike from the family compound to a lake, wadding in, being noticed and pulled out when the monitor of a passing school bus recognizes her and as the school nurse is toweling her off, low and behold, a baby ""bump"".  While this might be a lot to process in its own right, there are so many layers of complexity that simply thinking that the story is about a pregnant 12-old girl that goes missing, does a disservice.

As the show progressed, the best (though far from perfect) analogy that I came up with, was that TOL has elements of the AMC (AKA USA) version of the program ""The Killing"" with perhaps of small element of ""Twin Peaks"" mixed in.

Moss does an admirable job putting her Kiwi on, as a Sidney Detective visiting her cancer ridden mom and being drawn into the case due her experience with children.  There is also some time given to Moss's back story while in HS at the TOL.

Holly Hunter gives a strange performance as some sort of sage that sets up a commune by the lake where woman with various ""issues"" all live in shipping containers.

Peter Mullan delivers the best performance of all as Matt Mitcham, Tui's father (from a prior marriage) and family patriarch.  I racked my brain searching for other performances by Peter Mullan and came back with 2-seasons of the BBC program ""The Fixer"" (Mickey).

The imagery alone of TOL will have you running to google to price out flights and accommodations.

Patience pays off, as by the final episode the laundry list of questions are answered.

While this might not be for everyone, it is so unique, disturbing and complex, that if you find yourself in the right frame of mind, highly recommended.",1366502400,4,2521,4.682539682539683

8563914,1,B00B83OIVA,"This series made no sense. We start off with a missing girl who is pregnant. But shes simply in hiding, not missing. The detective - played by Elizabeth Moss, is pulled into the investigation for no clear idea. Shes visiting her old hometown as her Mother is sick And somehow ends up running the investigation. Shes concerned the missing girls family, especially her father (played by Peter Mullen) are behind her disappearance Trying to find out who got her pregnant comes back to the girls odd family dynamic. Throw in Mosss characters boyfriend-who seems to be a drug addict working for the missing girls Dad-oh and by the way he may have given up his girlfriend years ago to a group of guys who raped her. Throw in Holly Hunter making an appearance as the leader of a group of dysfunctional women who camp out on land owned by the missing girls Dad. Except Hunter is given nothing to do but sit about and look mystical. Its a mess. Dont bother.

If I had seen this one first, I probably wouldn't have watched the second one. Although I liked Elisabeth Moss' performance, the rest of the characters were the most miserable, horrible people that I've seen in a series. The entire storyline with Holly Hunter was a total waste of time. I wish I could get my money back.",1507507200,,456,4.440476190476191
8563917,1,B00B83OIVA,"One of the most vile movies I have ever seen. Continual, unrelenting use of strong profanity.  Every single character lack morals. A dog shot is dead right after being fed for no reason at all other than the man who shot him is a psychopath. This man is able to also kill people at will because the police are under his thumb. He has trained his sons to kill as well. A policeman gives information to him which results in another killing. His 12 year old daughter is pregnant and when he is told he brags that he had his first f*** at age 11 and says oh well if she's a slut, she's a slut. His grown son is sleeping with the mother of the 12 year old. This same son has a sexual encounter with the main female police character in the bathroom of a bar and then goes out to continue socializing with two other women. An older woman goes into a bar, lays money on the counter and says that it is for a seven minute sexual encounter (only she uses profanity). A man takes her up on it and follows her to a room where they have a bizarre encounter. I could go on and on and I didn't even watch half of this. I wanted to see what happened to the pitiable 12 year old child, but could wade through this cesspool no longer.",1504224000,3,1216,4.066666666666666
