8343340,3,B001UDS4CW,"C.M. Punk vs. Umaga - Punk returns to his hometown here in a match against another ""super-heavyweight"" like Kane last month but a completely different performance there.  This was a nice opener that told a nice story of Punk being on the defense to Umaga's ""Samoan Bulldozer"" offense full of nerve holds along with quick power moves.  It was a simple match but a good performance by both men.

ECW Champion Christian vs. Jack Swagger - This was very similar to the previous match in that the babyface (Christian) was on the defense for most of the bout here with Christian getting some moves in countering Swagger.  This was a good showcase for Swagger but in the end, this was easily a step down from their Backlash match along with the match they had on Sci-Fi back in March.

John Morrison vs. Shelton Benjamin - Two of the most athletic young wrestlers on the roster clash here with Charlie Hass coming out with Shelton making this the third reunion between the ""World's Greatest Tag Team.""  Both men pulled out some innovative offense throughout the match including some spots that got botched making you say ""Ouch, you know that had to hurt.""  Great match & one of the best of the night.

Right around here an the usual in-ring segment of the show this time with The Miz & Santino Marella which unlike most of these segments, this was worth watching from The Miz getting the heel heat from the crowd to the comedy from Santino that is actually funny like the ""Santina"" crap we've been getting.

Intercontinental Champion Rey Mysterio vs. Chris Jericho - The entire match was around what Chris Jericho guarenteed wouldn't happened, Mysterio wouldn't hit the 6-1-9 on him.  Great back & forth paced match here with Jericho pulling out some moves like TNA wrestler Abyss' ""Shock Treatment"" backbreaker along with other counters to Mysterio's fast high flyin' offense like the Walls Of Jericho at one point.  One point of this match would also plant the seeds for what the future basis of their feud would be based off.  Another great match here with the crowd getting more into it over time.

WWE Champion Randy Orton vs. Batista - This was almost an exact clone of their match from Armageddon months earlier in that it was one of those matches that didn't go past ""first gear"" as they kept the same pace throughout the match with it only picking up at various spots.  It got interesting towards the end with Orton trying to use the ""champion's advantage"" but Batista constantly making sure Orton didn't get off that easy.  The only noteworthy thing here was the special appearence afterwards but past that, this was just a match that wasn't bad but just average & nothing special.

John Cena vs. Big Show - Concidering how I actually enjoyed their feud back in late 2003/early 2004 but this was certainly a long time ago based off how this match was because if the purpose of this match was to give a bathroom break inbetween the title matches then this did it's job.  After Cena & Edge tore the house down the previous month, we got the sterotypical performance from Cena that causes so much backlash towards him from the ""WWE Universe.""  You understand the story throughout the match that Cena wasn't 100% from his internal injuries from Backlash along with the beats Show gave him on RAW so Show dominated this match...however it ended with Cena doing his usual comeback & win like everything before the match never happened.  If the match was shorter then it wouldn't have been so bad but it was long, dry, dull, and boring.

World Champion Edge vs. Jeff Hardy - I've said it before that Jeff & Edge never had a bad match to my memory...and this is no exception as they did a good wrestling match with each man vibing off each other well with J.R. doing a great job on the commentary putting over how Hardy kept using ""calculating risk"" with his offense instead of just being a daredevil including pulling out a few moves we aren't used to them like Jeff doing Bret Hart's Sharpshooter & taking one hell of a superplex from Edge with a sick looking landing.  The ending was a bit of a jip but it doesn't take away from these two putting on a great solid performance here.

In the end, this PPV perfectly showcased what direction both brands were since the 2009 Draft where SmackDown was the ""professional wrestling"" brand showcasing the more athletic wrestlers & competitve matches....RAW is the complete opposite featuring the ""sports entertainment"" formula that was heavily stale here....and ECW was only one step behind SmackDown in quality but had an off night here.  In the end...there are two ways to look at this PPV, bottom line is that SmackDown dominated this PPV & if your a big fan of the direction of that brand for the past couple of months then this is worth checking out.  However, all of these matches except one (Morrison/Benjamin) had a gimmicked rematch at the next PPV (Extreme Rules) so if your a bigger fan of gimmick matches than regular one on one encounters, then you can skip this one.",1246579200,2,5020,4.6591166477916195
8343341,2,B001UDS4CW,"I got this for practically nothing and I was STILL disappointed.  The most watchable match was Morrison vs. Benjamin, tomorrow's next BIG stars. The rest was the same rehash...zzz",1245628800,,179,5.172413793103448
8343342,4,B001UDS4CW,"Umaga VS CM Punk: A very good opener with alot of back and fourth action. Umaga looks impressive against Punk, which is sad because Umaga would be released soon after this event. The hometown hero goes down to the Samoan spike. Despite the loss, everyone thought he'd cash in Money in the Bank later on in the show.

Christian VS Jack Swagger: Anther great match between these two. The ending was awesome.

Shelton Benjamin VS John Morrison: This match was good with a few botched spots along the way. Benjamin is vastly underrated and I wouldn't be surprised if he leaves when his contract comes up, which should be soon. The ending was awesome and once again, Smackdown has the best wrestling and wrestlers in the world. Morrison is highly praised by JR and I concur, he is the future of the WWE.

Miz comes out and cuts a promo. I've been annoyed by this guy for the longest time but i've been learning to like the guy. He is good on the mic but until he beats Cena, he is just the youth knocking at the door that WWE won't let in. I'm laughing at this interview running down the Cubs and Soranio. Santino comes out and things can only get better from here. This is some pretty funny stuff, even though it could have been saved for Raw.

Rey Mysterio VS Chris Jericho: Anther fantastic match, what a card this is turning out to be. This is the start of the feud and story of how Jericho wants to take off Mysterio's mask. I liked the match but Mysterio's finisher is just plain weak.

Batista VS Randy Orton: I dvr Raw each week and i'm bored to death of the world title division, always the same old wrestlers. This is a decent match but nothing out of the ordinary. The ending was stupid with Orton getting disqualified for slapping the ref. Legacy attacks Batista and Ric Flair makes his surprise return.

John Cena VS Big Show: A slow paced match with Show beating on Cena thru the first few minutes. I just skipped over this match and watched the last few minutes of it. I do enjoy Cena's top rope leg drop move. Cena wins in the end with an attitude adjustment and the annoucers sell it like he never beat Show before with that move.

Edge VS Jeff Hardy: This was a typical Hardy-Edge match and really nothing too bad but nothing speical. Everyone thought the hometown kid, CM Punk, would cash in but he did not.

The first four matches were excellent but the last three weren't so great. I just realized this didn't feature a diva's match, which is good because I don't watch those matches.",1245369600,2,2500,4.407809110629067
8343343,4,B001UDS4CW,"This was a very fun show with a lot of good wrestling taking place in front of a hot Chicago crowd.  I personally did not think this was quite as good as last month's Backlash show, but it was in the same league.  The only difference between the two is that Judgment Day lacked one tremendous match.  That being said, 6 out of the 7 matches ranked from good to very good, and while it wasn't a very newsworthy show (aside from Flair's return), the overall wrestling quality on this DVD is enough to warrant a purchase.

1. CM Punk vs. Umaga

Very good opener.  Punk was super over in his home town and the crowd was very into it.  Match slowed down a bit in the middle while Umaga was getting the heat on Punk but the crowd didn't die and the last several minutes were quite good.  Great Start to the show.  ***1/4

2. ECW Championship Match
Christian (c) vs. Jack Swagger

They had their usual good match, but I didn't think it was quite up to the level of their previous encounters.  I didn't care for the ending, even though it made sense in the storyline, but it looks like this fued will continue which is not a bad thing.  ***1/4

3. John Morrison vs. Shelton Benjamin

This was a good match that was horrifying at times, because there were several moments where moves were not executed all that safely.  The crowd popped for the moves, but not so much for the superstars.  It doesn't appear people quite buy Morrison as a face just yet, and the fact that he's working against an heel who isn't very over doesn't help, but by the end of the match they were into him.  ***1/4

Once this match ended there was a segment involving the Miz, Alfonso Soriano of the Chicago Cubs, and Santino Marella (although briefly).  I am usually not of a fan of having these segments on ppv, but this was all very good and Miz was tremendous in running down the Cubs.  He was getting a ton of heat and it was great, and if I have one complaint it's that the segment went too long.  Usually I'd say skip this but I quite enjoyed this spectacle.

4. Intercontinental Championship Match
Rey Mysterio (c) vs. Chris Jericho

This was a great match, the best match of the night.  These two have always worked well together over the years, and this was one of their better matches.  The crowd was mega hot for all of this, and Jericho had plenty of fans in the building, but nobody was booing Rey.  Tons of near falls and false finishes at the end and the crowd was going hoss for all of it.  Awesome stuff, I loved this match.  ***3/4

5. WWE Championship Match
Randy Orton (c) vs. Batista

I thought this was a good match.  It wasn't great, but it was well booked, with the basic story being Orton repeatedly trying to get counted out and Batista not allowing him to do so.  This put Orton over as a coward and Batista over as a force to be dealt with and it worked.  There were some good near falls at the end and the crowd was very into it.  They even did the ""BOO!"", ""YAY!"" chants for the back and forth punches, with Orton getting cheered and Batista getting booed.  The finish was atrociously bad, but when Flair made his run in the fans completely forgot about it so in that case this was a success.  ***

6. John Cena vs. the Big Show

This was the weakest match on the show by far.  These two have never worked well together and the match was very slow paced and boring.  The crowd popped for the finish but were pretty dead for most of the match, aside from some dueling ""cena sucks!"" and ""lets go cena!"" chants.  It's not unwatchable, but don't go out of your way to see it it will make you sleepy.  *1/2

7. World Heavyweight Championship Match
Edge (c) vs. Jeff Hardy

Very good match, only a notch below the IC title match in quality.  The crowd was pretty dead for the first half of this due to the Cena/Big Show match, but they really got into by the end which is a credit to the workers.  The finish was awesome, and they managed to execute a few innovative spots.  It was also nice to see Edge retain because the titles have been changing hands far too frequently as of late.  Great way to end the show.  ***3/4

I highly recommend adding this dvd to your collection.  With one exception, every match on the show is good to very good, and that's a rarity in this day and age.  This makes two great ppvs in a row from WWE, and I hope they can keep this streak going.",1242604800,4,4365,4.253349573690621
