3147231,4,B0015RRNJ8,"I love reptiles, and theses dvd's cover the gamete. I'm not the biggest Jules Sylvester fan. But with everything he covers in these, it's well worth the money. From vipers to crocs, it fits the bill.",1391558400,3,199,4.555555555555555
3147232,5,B0015RRNJ8,This is an awesome set guaranteed to delight nature lover to Herpetologist. A full 3 1/2 hours of viewing enjoyment with complete descriptions and loads of great close ups and creature secrets. A real treat at a low price- Buy it now!,1386547200,2,234,4.595238095238095
3147233,5,B0015RRNJ8,"This is a fascinating look at all kinds of snakes and crocodiles.  My 3-year-old grandson is enamored of these four 50-minute DVDs.  He usually views one of them when he visits overnight and is learning much about these two species of animals.  I would recommend this set for children 3-years-old and up, as it is very educational and well-narrated.  It studies the animals inside and out and explains what children are wondering about.",1375056000,2,436,4.931506849315069
3147234,4,B0015RRNJ8,Good set but after watching The Beauty Of Snakes on Blu ray I realised there is no other way of watching tv other than HD.,1360627200,,122,3.92
3147235,4,B0015RRNJ8,"We bought this for our grandson who is currently obsessed with Yes, you guessed it.........SNAKES and CROCS. At first he played it like it was just something else on the TV......after a short time of sneaking peeks at the screen, he was full on into it. Clearly this series is written with the young adult to adult in mind. He (our grandson) is going on six and we feel he understood a good 80-90% of what was being presented. Although, these nature videos do have some violence and really, where in nature isn't there any............We feel this being an actual depiction of nature and the animal world around us, we much prefer to present this series to him then say something like SpongeBob SquarePants.",1356825600,9,706,4.701612903225806
3147236,3,B0015RRNJ8,This item was a gift to be used in a grade school class therefore I have no way of reviewing it.,1344384000,,96,3.619047619047619
3147237,5,B0015RRNJ8,"Don't mess with a hungry crock, don't even come close. Unlike Rodney Dangerfield, the late great comic (my all-time favorite), the crocs and snakes in this video have no trouble getting their share of respect. Fascinating footy and worth every penny.",1342915200,6,250,5.121951219512195
3147238,5,B0015RRNJ8,"This is a professionally done, very interesting set of four DVD's.  Anyone who is interested in reptiles, especially crocodiles, big lizards and snakes, will find this set entertaining.  Jules Sylvester is one of the best - articulate, good with the animals and comfortable in front of the camera.

8259686,4,B0015RRNJ8,"These DVDs are wonderful!  We found ourselves in a love/hate relationship with crocs.  We even laughed and said ""awwwww!"" a few times.  It was great!  The only thing I did not like was the religion of evolution thrown in.",1431129600,,221,4.589743589743589
8259687,4,B0015RRNJ8,"Living in a country that has big snakes and big crocodiles, then these dvd's were interesting, but not new to me. Living where these monsters eat and kill people is something that we are always aware of. As with other countries that have these ""nasties"" close at hand, there are far too many people (in Australia) anyway, that disregard the dangers these animals. As a result of their stupidity (not ignorance), yes, stupidity. As a result, they get killed and eaten, then everyone blames the crocs. But, Crocodiles and snakes, big and small have a place among us and a job to do and they do it well. These dvd's will enlighten your minds about these animals, their existence and their way of life. If you are stupid enough to get in their way, they will attack you and probably kill you. Be enlightened and learn. We need these animals, they don't need us. In fact, I have no doubt that they would rather we were not here. This is dvd set is good viewing and a good buy. So, go ahead and buy it....and learn about the animals we live with.",1415664000,4,1040,4.421875
