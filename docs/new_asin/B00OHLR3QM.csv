6751304,5,B00OHLR3QM,"I love wolfblood I love wolves and I loved all of the seasons what I think you should do for season 4 is that tom and shannon go to canada to see their freinds and then tom and shannon half to go but some body followed them and he is a hunter and he discovers where the families den is and the rest you guys can figure it out but if you are already working on season 4 then its ok. but I really am a big fan love your show!

6751322,5,B00OHLR3QM,"Not shown as it was in the UK. Jana bites not in order and without credits. Episodes 12 and 13  have different endings and beginings repectively ie ending for 12 not in silence which adds to its mystery and opening credits in 13 different - not showing the images from Jana Bites
But, it is the full story and you cant get it in the UK. Fast delivery too.",1428364800,,355,4.144927536231884

6751325,5,B00OHLR3QM,"What can I say. Even without the main character Maddy, Wolfblood: Season 3 takes storytelling, character development and many other elements (music, dialogue, etc) to the next level. It is definitely one to watch. All 13 episodes + Webisode Series (Jana Bites) will draw you in, desperately wanting to know what will happen. Congrats to the cast and crew",1427846400,,354,5.016949152542373

6751337,2,B00OHLR3QM,At first I was disappointed because part of the original cast (main character and her family were missing. The first two season developed well wth dynamics of the wolf girl and her family revealing their secrets to their friends. The third season introduction of a shadowy corporation was really a let down. Some of the storylines were less developed than in the two season. What happened to the original writers? I would not recommend this season. .,1427500800,3,450,4.857142857142857
