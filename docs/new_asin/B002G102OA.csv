8369622,5,B002G102OA,I have several of the shows in this series.  This is probably the most beautiful show on reefs that I have ever watched.  I had previously seen this show on TV & wanted a copy for myself.,1385856000,,187,4.027027027027027
8369623,5,B002G102OA,"This is eye candy. beautiful pictures, and a lot of info on fishes and corals. A must add blu ray to your collection.",1377561600,,117,4.130434782608695
8369624,5,B002G102OA,"The visuals and colors in this documentary are still some of the most strikingly beautiful shots I've ever seen.  The sea life is mind-blowingly diverse.  The commentary is interesting and good quality, but I also love just putting this on with music behind it.  Great ""salt water tank"" to have in the room.  ;)",1377561600,,311,4.703703703703703
8369625,5,B002G102OA,"My spouse and I are scuba divers and in fact we've dived in the Raja Ampat islands of Indonesia where this was shot--and it does justice to them. Possibly the most fabulous diving on Earth, at the price of wild, unpredictable currents in most places, and medical help at least 8 hours' away (time for a patrol boat to get to you from Sorong and take you back to the modest medical facilities there). Or you can watch this disk.

This has none of the production razzamatazz of the IMAX movies--and none of the schmaltz. If you want to see why we go all the way to Indonesia to dive, this will show you.

I'll be viewing this many times, making it a much better deal than most of the movies we buy, watch once, and rarely twice.",1357603200,,726,4.253623188405797
8369626,5,B002G102OA,"Best video I have found if you love saltwater fish/ invertebrates. Beautiful cinematography, and information to go with it. Great images of corals and inside their skeletal structure.",1352678400,,183,5.571428571428571
8369627,3,B002G102OA,"5 stars for the series, 1 star for the release, so average: 3 stars

The ""Equator"" series is a wonderfully filmed, written and narrated nature series. In quality is matches, if not surpasses, the later and much more hyped ""Planet Earth"", ""Life"" series's. Unfortunately, the producers and/or distributors did not market it as successfully. As to the DVD releases, they also made a few blunders:

1. the cover of these DVDs are too gaudy, it makes one think of them as cheap children films. But they are not; they are professionally made nature shows.
2. they did not release them as a box set. In fact, it is very hard to find all the DVDs in the same series.

There are:
1) Power of an Ocean: The Galapagos and Palmyra ...
2) Battle for the Light: The rainforests of South East Asia ...
3) Rivers of the Sun: The mighty Amazon River ...
4) Paradox of the Andes: In Ecuador the equatorial sun ...
5) Reef of Riches: tropical jungle and on the coral reef ...
6) Challenge of Change > the Great Rift Valley ...

One day I will add all of these to my collection.

Note to Discovery: please release a box set of Bluray DVDs!",1292025600,8,1119,4.360576923076923
8369628,5,B002G102OA,"This is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. Coral reefs are perhaps the most beautiful and complex environments there are. I enjoy watching this over and over and have shared it with friends who also liked it. Highly recommended.

8369629,5,B002G102OA,"This is the best REEF doumentary I've ever seen.  It stays on course with plenty of mind - boggeling footage of what can (even today) be described as ""PRISTINE"" coral cover.  There is enough; but not too much, biological data thrown your way to actually keep it interesting without causing you to nod off, like an Al Gore Speech. Next best thing to being there!",1271289600,4,361,4.538461538461538
8369630,4,B002G102OA,"This movie was a wonderful overview about reefs and sea life that lives around reef habitats.  The quality of the scenes was amazing, especially in high definition.  Not only was the scenery beautiful but the lessons given on many of the different life forms was fascinating and very informative.  I kept thinking about how great the documentary would have been with a class once taken in marine biology several years ago.  The material presented was both accurate and very engaging.  Students that wish to learn about marine life or marine biology could learn quite a bit with this video. Highly recommended for anyone interested in reef ecosystems or marine life in general.",1266537600,5,676,5.0
8369631,5,B002G102OA,"Since I'm not going to be swimming near Indonesia any time soon, it was excellent to get a chance to see all the life in its coral reefs.  You'll love all the colors.  It's amazing how life comes in so many forms.
There are larger fish eating smaller ones here.  There is one example of parasitism.  However, most of it speaks about symbiotic relationships between species.  Usually, hybrids are seen as infertile and bad.  Here, they are spoken about as having potential.  Unlike depressing environmental docs that focus on places like this disappearing, this work does not end on a sad note.
Sometimes the subtitles have typos.  This is much like what you would see at a museum, just longer.  Still, I enjoyed it and I imagine that bio classes and small children would like it too.",1255219200,,783,4.656934306569343
