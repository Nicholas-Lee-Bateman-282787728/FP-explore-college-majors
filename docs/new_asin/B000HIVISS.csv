2638100,3,B000HIVISS,"""Race movies,"" a genre unique to the United States between 1915 and 1947, were quite popular with black Southern audiences and in Northern industrial cities that had large African American communities. After the successful legal desegregation of the film industry in 1948, this type of movie vanished, literally. Today, only a fifth of the original 500 race films still exist.

SYNOPSES:

""The Black King"" - Bud Pollard directed this story of a Baptist minister who starts a ""Back to Africa"" movement, but is then accused of swindling money from his followers. This movie, made by a white-owned company, was billed as a satire on the life of Marcus Garvey, an early black separatist. (After a fraud conviction, Garvey was deported to Jamaica in 1925-- he is now recognized as a hero of that island nation.)

""Junction 88"" is an all-black community where Lolly (Cooke) lives. She wants to marry unsuccessful songwriter Buster (Clark), but her father (Smith) has another, much cruder man named Onnie (Junior) in mind for son-in-law, as he can provide for Lolly. Appearing as themselves: Vaudeville comic Pigmeat Markham and ragtime composer Noble Sissle. Musical highlight is a jazzy church concert.

ALPHA VIDEO is a provider of vintage programming that's often unavailable elsewhere. Their prices are fair, but so is transfer quality of some of their offerings. None have undergone restoration, yet this product's rareness and an honest price make it a worthwhile purchase.

2638101,3,B000HIVISS,"Black nationalists and those familiar with Black history will not like this film. Essentially, it's the tale of this con-artist named ""Charcoal Johnson"" who schemes poor and ignorant African-Americans into giving up their loot for a phony ""Back to Africa"" movement. This is, of course, a satirization of the Marcus garvey movement of the 1920s in which Garvey wanted to establish a Black settlement in Liberia akin to Israel for the Jewish people and was arrested for mail fraud. Today, most who are familiar with Garvey's story feel that Garvey was framed and he is now considered a hero. So this film, with it's porttrayal of Black leadership as imcompetent clowns, will ruffle some feathers.
It is interesting to note that going through some old African-American newspapers, Black audiences of 1932 actually enjoyed this film. It would be interesting to the what would happen now if you showed this at, say the Apollo Theater.
It would also be interesting to compare this to 1970s ""Cotton Comes To Harlem,"" which had a similar theme with a contemporary spin.",1006214400,12,1061,5.0
