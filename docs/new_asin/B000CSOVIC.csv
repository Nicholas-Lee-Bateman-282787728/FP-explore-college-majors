8101805,1,B000CSOVIC,"Some of the Turkish people think that since they were born into a Muslim family, they have every right to call themselves muslim. They hear Azaan in their homeland, they have cultural knowledge and habitual practice of Islam and they suddenly become scholars to understand and pass judgements about Islam. I unfortunately know this type. I grow up with this kind of shallow people around. They are never tired of insulting you as you practice muslim faith. When they move from a semi-atheist semi-muslim state of being to a real religious faith (in this case Christianity) they suddenly find themselves very confident about the teachings of Islam and Quran. Now that they are so knowledgable about Islam that they even managed to ask themselves questions about Islam and try to answer them. I admit that this is a progress. At least they are Christian now, instead of being a member of state owned and operated Turkish style cultural greco-islamic, make and believe religion. The only bad thing is that these guys unfortunately are children of an agitative intellectual atmosphere which masters in presenting the facts to an audiance in the form of fake truths. If you want to be agitated against Islam go ahead and read the book, but do not forget ""He who is without sin among you, let him throw the first stone at her"". If you are a good Christian and want to learn more about Islam you can read the book but then it is your responsibility to your FAITH to learn the real truths about Islam from a real Islamic scholar.",1136073600,14,1521,4.7218045112781954
8101806,1,B000CSOVIC,I have lived in Turkey and I  know for fact if someone lived with a true Islam they will never convert to any other religion. It is not necessary because Islam covers and accept the true Judaism and Christianity that revealed from God (Allah) and Muslims accept Jesus as prophet. Christians lives in Islamic countries (especially in Turkey where this false charlatan-Ergun Mehmet Caner came from) freely and they can practice their faith with great tolerance. Ergun Mehmet Caner was newer Muslim and just tries to make Islam bad by converting himself to Christianity. Ergun Caner's mother Inez Manica is Swedish Christian and His other relatives are also married with Christians. We as Muslims are not allowed to say anything bad against the People of the book -Christian and neither Jews nor we welcome anything negative said about Islam like these people claiming. What a pity for that and they will be judged by God in the Judgment day.,1136073600,15,939,4.90566037735849
