I loved it that snow white fought back, the wicked queen was absolutely great. I loved who she fell in love with.watch  this movie and you will never be sorry.",924652800,3,262,4.695652173913044
921408,4,630464972X,"""Snow White: A Tale of Terror"" was attractive to me because it had a dark sadistic twist to it.  After watching this movie twice, once on regular TV and again on cable, I will never look at the Disney version the  same way again. The mirror should have been destroyed along with the wicked  queen.  I can't wait to see what they do with ""Sleeping Beauty""  or ""Hansel and Gretel""!!",921369600,2,380,4.371428571428571
921409,5,630464972X,"I am amazed this movie didn't hit it big. I suppose that just goes to show the stupidity of the populace..... But this movie is wonderful. Everything about it was fantastic. I am a rough movie critic, but I must admit it had  great costumes, a magical setting, fantastic actors.... The skill of these  is evident as you begin to notice the slight changes in the facial features  of the Queen, for example, as she begins to resent her stepdaughter. This  is no conservative fairy tale. And I must say, Snow White, called Lilyana  in the film, is the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. I hope to see her  more in future films. If you cannot buy this film directly, at least rent  it. It is truly a work of art.",915926400,10,709,4.325757575757576
921410,5,630464972X,"This version of Snow White has all the horror of the original tale, and some new twists to keep you wondering until the end. Snow White, called Lily in this version, lost her mother as she was born. Her father marries  Lady Claudia, a beautiful woman who is outwardly a devout Christian, but  still casts runes in her own rooms, and whose weakness is a mirror and her  need to be the center of attention. At first she is pleasant to her new  stepdaughter, but she soon becomes jealousy of Lily, who alone seems to  draw her husband's attention away from her, leading her to decide Lily must  die.  Lily escapes into the forest ... then the story really becomes  interesting.
If you enjoy seeing fairy tales the way they were meant to  be you'll enjoy this!",912297600,5,756,4.45985401459854

921548,4,630464972X,I loved to hate Sigourney Weaver. That is a testament to her talents as an actress.  There were aspects that confused me in re... to the mirror. It came to life and destroyed a servant who was simply being curious.  There didn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to it. There should have been some background as to how the mirror came about.

921555,3,630464972X,It's a little creepy. Definitely an interesting interpretation of the Snow White fairy tale. Many parts didn't seem fully developed. Mostly I just wanted to slap Liliana (aka Snow White). A good movie to watch if you don't have very high expectations.

921666,4,630464972X,"A good gothic thriller.  More in the direction of the Grimm Brothers and less like the Disney type version.  Sigourney Weaver does a excellent job as the sinister Queen who loses it after losing her baby and focuses on doing away with her step daughter Lillian.  A well done horror movie more so than a fairytale type movie.  An entertaining tale with more of the movie focusing on the Queen than Snow White, as she loses her sanity.",1410220800,,433,4.512820512820513

I have yet to see a live action Snow White that comes close to being as good as this one. Some people expected this to be scary, but it is more a dark retelling. Maybe for kids it would be a bit scary. Sigourney Weaver does an awesome job.",1404259200,,352,4.042857142857143
921673,5,630464972X,"While the details are different, the feel of this Snow White is closer to the original story than any other I have seen. I hate the Disneyfication of grand old stories.

921728,4,630464972X,"1. It has Sigourney Weaver in it (one of my top favorite actresses!) and Sam O'Neal does a good job too as the king;
2. It's well written & very well portrayed by the ENTIRE cast; and
3. It's not a children's version ""with rainbows, sparkles & unicorns"" (it's rather dark & scary!) and has a great twist on the entire story.
One of my favorites,  without a doubt ;-) (along with Snow White & the Huntsman)!  I watch it every time it (rarely) runs on TV, so thought it should be added to my library! Love this film & the different (yet still triumphant) ending! Would highly recommend it - even if you only rent it. ;-)",1391472000,,618,4.228813559322034
921729,5,630464972X,This is a movie that twist a classic tale and makes into a horror/psychological thriller. The movie was very well done and creative and if you like horror with twist on a fairy tale this is for you.,1383091200,,198,4.2368421052631575

Adults I do not recommend this movie to kids below 13.....It is that dark........It's very good, jsut very adult themee, scary, and dark...Will definitely ...I feel give your kids night mares......",1379289600,,365,4.870967741935484
921731,5,630464972X,An earlier spin to Snow White and the Huntsmen. Sam Neil and Sigourney Weaver were great.  I discovered this movie on Netflix and enjoyed it enough to purchase.,1378339200,,160,4.714285714285714
921732,5,630464972X,"I really like this movie, Sigourney Weaver is amazing, as always, and just the way they did it, it's very good, caught my interest right off and I really think all the actors were great...if you have some imagination in you, watch this movie.",1378080000,,242,4.5227272727272725
921733,4,630464972X,"A harsh story based on the difficulties inherent in the daughter-stepmother relationship. The  period on which the movie focuses was one in which many men, with children, lost first wives, not to divorce, but to the very high death rate  in childbirth. That the father's second wife happens to be a witch is simply a mask, a defense against recognizing that both females in the situation, wife and daughter, are competing for the love of the husband-father, both hate  the other, both use the tools at their disposal to try to destroy the other. On the whole, the stepmother gets a bum rap. Whether or not she came  prepared to share the husband with his daughter, the daughter, being the more naive and innocent, is the more overtly hostile, to a degree that would take a Saint not to react. In this case, the stepmother is anything but a Saint. The point of the story, is that  the  daughter also was no Saint, she simply had fewer weapons at her disposal until she was forced to mingle with the rough crowd who represent the 7 dwarfs. From her interactions with them, she returns in order to destroy her rival, pitting her youthful vigor (and relationship with her father) against the evil wiles of her stepmother. The denouement is a vigorous scene, the nature of which I cannot disclose.
Appropriately the two key roles are wife and daughter, ably handled by Weaver and Monica Keena, respectively. Sam Neill has little to do and does little. Others in the cast play subordinate roles with competence. While there is a certain murkiness in some of the more active scenes, on the whole photography and scenic design facilitate the development of the central theme.
While not a must-see film by any means, it is an entertaining and interesting one, worth a look-in.",1375660800,2,1767,4.720779220779221
921734,5,630464972X,"Watching Snow White and the Huntsman this weekend on free HBO weekend reminded how much I love this Tale of Terror version! All the computer generated effects and lackluster acting in Huntsman was a big letdown. Now THIS one, however, has it all in my opinion - horror, humor and great characters and actors. Love it and highly recommend it.",1365033600,,341,4.7
921735,1,630464972X,"I bought this movie for Sigourney Weaver but it just wasn't my style; too sci-fi for me, but would be good for you adventuresome types",1364256000,,134,4.4
921843,3,630464972X,"There are some issues with this re-figuration of the original tale that detract from the movie overall.
First and foremost is the casting of Sigourney Weaver as ""The Wicked Stepmother"". (Well she's not called that here, she's a duchess or something, but you know the character I mean.)

She is/was never a great beauty, so when she wants to remain the greatest beauty in the land, it simply doesn't wash for the audience.
While they can (and do!)dub her inexplicable singing, they just can't dub her looks.
And while the costume designer has tried to artistically clothe everybody in browns, russets and yellows, it must be said that yellow just is NOT Ms. Weaver's colour, ...AT ALL!
She's given a series of what look like over embroidered, sprigged and frilled huge duvets to wear that cover her completely and literally drain what little colour she has in her complexion.
(And I kept waiting for her to utter ""Get away from her you bitch!)

Secondly the girl who plays the Snow White character (Lilly?) isn't exactly endowed with looks that are anything to be envious of, well apart from her youth I suppose. She also is not served well by wardrobe, specially when she appears in what is supposed to be her dear dead mother's dress she has found in the attic. It's meant to be a show stopper, detracting from her stepmother's predilection for public singing, but looks more like a crumpled up old charity-shop cast-off. This was an opportunity for the designer to shine, ...but they blew it bigtime!
And for some reason she's almost a dwarf herself, ...tiny! Specially when standing next to the tall, but MOST uncharismatic Prince in the very worst orangutan-orange Prince Valiant wig.
Thankfully, he DOESN'T get to marry Snow White, here but SPOILER, SPOILER, ..SPOILER, takes a rather unorthodox exit from the castle's upper window via a very long first step!
He's never portrayed as anything of a brain, and if it was left up to him, Snow White would have been buried alive! He even pashes The Wicked Stepmother at one stage!
It's an.....""uncomfortable"" scene to say the least, ....but wait a bit, there's an even more unsettling scene to come. More about that little corker later on!

Interestingly, the dwarfs are not really dwarfs at all, (well apart from one), but a roving band of outlawed peasants digging for some never identified substance in a rather shaky mine. The gang contains nasty ones, nice ones and in a departure from the original storyline, ....a heroic hairy-chested one who was forced to watch his family burned at the stake and had his own face disfigured by the christians trying to press-gang him into the crusades. Nice to see christianity portrayed in its true colours for a change, eh?
But do keep your eye on this bloke, ...he's da man!!!

The settings are suitably storybook, ...the forests sometimes shown in fairly lurid technicolor tones that are somewhat disconcerting, but the intention is obviously to give the whole thing a fairytale quality.
The sets are good overall, especially the large armoire that contains THAT mirror, which is an absolute ripper! (Forget that mundane old wardrobe in ""The Lion, Witch and the...!) The fastening of this dresser is absolutely stunning, ...and most chilling just by way of its clever and sinister design. You won't forget it easily.
It would have fascinated, yet scared the hell out of any kid sneaking around stepmother's bedroom.

As mentioned before, there are a few departures from the old story we are all familiar with that hold interest. Special effects are also quite good, and NOT overused for a change.

Now sorry about this next bit, but it's SO bizarre that I've got to mention it. It's the one I referred to before. Brace yourselves here.
At one stage when The Queen has immobilised everybody in the castle with poison, she goes to her husband (Sam Neil, ..he's in bed), uncovers his otherwise helpless body, and manually masturbates him to orgasm! Yes, you read right!
In what can only be described as something of a departure from the original material, the storyline at this stage has her in need of some of his ""seed"" to re-animate her previously still-born baby that she has bizarrely secreted away for years!
Weird, ...or what? Apparently, she manages to successfully do just this too, ....using her ""gatherings"". Talk about test-tube babies....
Surely the pages where this happens must have been missing from my childhood copy of Grimm's Fairy Tales? I'm sure I would have remembered THAT bit!

There are in fact a couple of instances throughout the movie that suggest a fair bit of material has been edited out that would have explained certain sequences left in. Carelessness on the editor's part I would suggest.

I quite enjoyed watching this, in spite of it's fairly obvious failings.
Interesting that Snow White does NOT end up being kissed by that soppy Prince, or living happily ever after with him either .
(He's such a wooden, unromantic dolt!) Just goes to prove that when the chips are really down, women prefer hairy-chested, down-to-earth blokes who are good in a crisis, rather than primped and preened self-obsessed Prince Charmings!
And visually much of it is quite engrossing.
Also good to see CSG effects not dominating a movie, ...as we have so come to expect these days.

This version is NOT exactly for young children which is a plus for we adults, although are any of the Grimm's tales in their original forms all that suitable for les enfants?
Eight or nine year olds upward should be able to watch this with going into bedroom jitters. They are probably watching FAR worse on those computers in their rooms anyway, ....like The Nightly News?",1363046400,3,5667,4.864248704663212
921844,1,630464972X,"I'd been looking forward to watching Snow White, starring Sam Neill and Sigourney Weaver, for months. So when I found myself with an evening alone and nothing planned, I finally rented it and prepared to thoroughly enjoy the film. Didn't happen. This is not the worst movie I've seen in a year, but it is the worst waste of potentially good acting, writing and story I've seen in several years.

The acting is worse than wooden, it's more like damp, moldy sawdust. The cast slogged through their lines as if it was their first script rehearsal. The script leaves all of the important back story details of the Grimm Brothers out, referring to them in passing. And where the script frequently departs from Grimms' original story, the departures make no sense whatsoever.

The special effects, the makeup, the sets and the lighting are amateurish. To be fair, the costumes are well done, except when you see the modern soles on Neill's boots and realize they probably came from a modern hipster-cum-goth-wannabe catalog.

Very disappointed.",1359158400,,1038,4.954022988505747

the price is good and i would recommend it someone for it",1356566400,,97,3.9
921847,5,630464972X,"The original fairy tales of Renaissance and Medieval Europe were dark, gothic tales perfect for a time when overland travel could kill you and villages were cut off from each other by deep, dark, dangerous forests. The tales were often based on gossip that traveled many miles and many years, changing in the telling. For example, some etymologists think that Sleeping Beauty was based on the murderess, Countess Bathory, who bathed in the blood of virgins to keep herself young and was walled up alive as punishment. Traveling decades through the forests of Europe, the tale became one of a Sleeping Princess, locked forever in sleep behind unscaleable walls or thickets too deep to pass.

By that standard, this cinematic version of the Snow White tale is one of the best ever as it relies on a psychological take and a real understanding of the dangers of Medieval Europe but at the same time retains the magic of fairy tales in a believable way. Snow White is the beloved daughter of a lord whose mother dies giving birth to her. Some years later, the father remarries and while the daughter and step-mother had the usual competition things might have been fine had not the step-mother lost her child in childbirth and was subsequently unable to bear another. The grief drove her to crazed jealousy and dark magic. Snow White, here called Lily is lost in the forest and the terrible living conditions and desperation of the common people is addressed and with a lighter hand than might be expected.

This is also a beautiful piece in that the settings, the costumes, the cinematography are all beautiful without sacrificing the dirt and detail and hardship of those times. A wonderful production, so good that I am considering adding it to my permanent collection rather than just renting it. I am a huge fan of the original fairy tales and modern takes on those classics and this more than satisfies both appetites. Highly recommended to fans of Once Upon a Time, Princess Bride, The 10th Kingdom and literary retellings of fairy tales. Superb!",1355702400,6,2049,4.834757834757835
921848,5,630464972X,"Although Snow White is a fairy tale for children, it is not by any means of the word a ""Nice"" story.  At its core it is horror story told in sweet terms.  This film takes out the sweet part of it.  Although the ""Snow White"" character, Liliana does fall in love she is not treated as a jewel by the people who take her in but rather as a pathetic creature who doesn't understand them.  As she grows to understand them she becomes stronger while the evil witch who is initially looked on as rather pathetic herself becomes more and more evil and ruthless because of some misguided idea that Liliana is to blame and her magic mirror leads her down this path.  In some ways the evil witch is a sympathetic creature because all she wants is to bring her dead son back to life and she will kill anyone she has to in order to do that. Liliana, of course, is forced to come face to face with her.  Liliana kills the mirror which is the real root of the evil and in the process kills the evil witch and saves herself, the man that she loves and her father.
I prefer this telling because it shows a more realistic side of the story.",1353715200,,1122,4.171296296296297

921912,4,630464972X,"Released in 1997 as a TV-Movie, Snow White - A Tale of Terror is clearly a movie which influenced the 2012 movie Snow White and the Huntsman. In both cases they move away from the bird-and-bunny filled Disney version and stick more closely to the dark roots of the Grimm world. In Tale of Terror, despite its implication that this is some sort of a Freddy Krueger bloodbath, it's really much more psychological.

Sigourney Weaver is brilliant as the stepmother tasked to come into the family of father-plus-daughter. She tries her best, even bringing the young girl a new puppy. But, as we know can happen with newly formed families, all did not go smoothly. The young girl resents the intrusion on her father's affection. The new stepmother gets frustrated and jealous of the father's adoration of his daughter, who reminds him of his dead wife. And, trapped in a single location for long years on end, the emotions build and build.

So rather than an evil, nasty, out-to-slay woman from the very beginning, Weaver's character is far more intricate. This means if you're hyped for a super-action film you might be disappointed here. The build is far more subtle, as the little things in life (along with a few not-so-little things) build up to finally push her over the edge into madness.

The movie is set in a late medieval era with hints of fantasy in it. Not entirely historically accurate, but after all, this is a fairy tale.

SPOILER ALERT TO FOLLOW - BOTH FOR HUNTSMAN AND TERROR

I watched this and Huntsman in ""reverse order"" - I saw Huntsman first and then this one. When I watched Huntsman I was not pleased with the storyline that she had a love who adored her for years. Then she meets a ""rougher guy"" and in only a few hours she decides he's the one for her. In watching Terror, I see that this was probably the source for that situation. Here we have Snow White deeply in love with a kind, well traveled, intelligent doctor. He proposes marriage to her, and she accepts.

And then she ends up with the ""seven dwarves"" - and one of them is a rough, handsome guy. So it seems that literally the second time she talks with him they are kissing. By the time the Queen/Crone shows up a few scenes later, Snow White is stating she's in love with him.

So the doctor shows up and is immediately worried about her. Yes, he momentarily falls for the Queen's seductions - and then he's off looking. He finds her and brings her home. But it's clear that she doesn't really care any more. She only wants the guy-of-the-moment. And then, conveniently, the doctor is slain, but nobody even cares. She's just happy that she's back with her dwarf. It doesn't even seem like she looks to see if the doctor is OK.

I'm not fond of storylines where a decent, noble, reliable, steadfast guy is thrown under the bus because some new hot-stuff guy has shown up for a minute or two.

So I'll give it 4/5 because I like most of the movie in general, but it loses a star for the Doctor / Dwarf situation.",1347667200,4,2996,4.492647058823529
921913,4,630464972X,"I actually passed this movie up when it was in the theaters because I didn't think it would be good.  I was totally wrong.  This film is actually quite good with a solid script and some excellent performances by all the principles, especially the actress playing Snow White as well as Sigorney Weaver and Gill Bellows, who has a handful of lines but has a terrific energy onscreen.  Even the smaller supporting roles are inhabited by character actors you'll recognize who bring depth to their parts.

The film is beautiful, gothic and spooky in the best Medievel ways.  This film is actually much better than the newer version with Charlize Theron and Kristin Stewart, mainly because of a stronger script and a MUCH better actress playing Snow.  My only wish was that they would have spoken in period language with English accents instead of contemporary English with American accents.  Even so, you get used to that rather quickly.

This new version of the classic fairy tale by The Brothers Grimm strips away the element of magic in a valiant attempt to be a real interpretation, like Ever After: A Cinderella Story would do to much better effect several years later. Monica Keena stars as Lili, who is meant to be Snow White, and she does a great job. (Why wasn't nudity included in the scene where she is bathing at the beginning, since the filmmakers felt they had to put that in?) Sigourney Weaver stars as the evil Claudia, meant to be a stand-in for the Queen, and she also plays the part admirably. However, the mirror image of Claudia is never explained and therefore smacks of magic, as this is meant to be a real version of Snow White. Sam Neill also does a good job as Lili's father, though his part is sorely under-written. And that brief sex scene made no sense whatsoever. I think the filmmakers just put that in there to give the movie an R rating.

922017,4,630464972X,"There seems to be a renewed passion for ""snow while"" this summer as there are already two big-budget movies on this old-time kid's classic. It's definitely a pleasant surprise to stumble upon this one - so little known but still worthwhile (at least I've never heard of it until most recently).

Overall, I enjoyed the mood and the twists of this movie. The development of the lead characters are very interesting: the queen did not start out being evil but gradually descended into evil madness as the tension between her and the ""snow white"" grew and her hope for a son was forever lost. On the other hand, Lilian (""snow white"" in this movie) wasn't exactly an epitome of innocence and kindness. Instead, she was quite spoiled and somewhat arrogant at the beginning, but later learned to be more compassionate and responsible through a strings of events.

I also liked  how the romance is played out here - a bit under-toned, so that it doesn't overshadow the spooky/dark elements while you still sense the strong feelings there.

Now to the downside, Since this is a rather old movie, possibly on a relatively low budget, the settings,music,special effects, etc are not exactly mesmerizing. The performances are good across the board, but nothing spectacular either. I'm not too crazy about Sigourney Weaver's look as the queen. The plot line evolves ok but could have used a bit more detail to flow better.

I'm not sure if it was poor direction or just personal preference, but Weaver's character seemed like it needed to be more external, rather than the quiet crazy. Her ability doesn't shine until she is covered in latex and prosthetics.

All in all, it was okay, but I have no desire to see it again. Spending $2.99 to watch it on-line was all the money I would like to spend on this movie.",1340064000,2,585,4.416666666666667
922020,5,630464972X,"Being a fan of fairy-tales; true fairy-tales that have not been ""made pretty"" by Disney and his ilk, and loving a film with strong gothic overtones and a touch of magic; I was rather well satisfied with this version of the tale of Snow White. Tastes range wildly and if you search long enough you are bound to find films that meet yours precisely. This was the case for me when I stumbled across this one. While this movie most certainly got mixed reviews when it was released (and still is it would seem if the reviews here are any indication), I personally found this one to fit my personal taste perfectly.

This 1997 version of the classic pretty well sticks to the one as collected by the Brothers Grimm. Yes, there are variations, but of the dozens upon dozens of renditions of this story on film, each has its own twist. At least this one kept to the overall mood, time and place the Brothers placed theirs. The origins of this story were quite likely German but most of the countries in Europe have there own. This film was shot in the Czech Republic and in Barvaria, and if for no other reason than to see the scenery; the wild woodland and ancient castles, then the viewer should consider this one.

This film is not wildly known which surprises me somewhat as the acting in it is wonderful. Sigourney Weaver plays a perfect wicked step-mother and Monica Keena fits the role of Snow White perfectly. Weaver's classic beauty blends well with the drop-dead gorgeous Keena. The supporting cast is made up of very talented actors...not a dog performance among them did I spot. (Well, there was of course a dog in this movie, but even he did a good job of playing his part). The costuming is some of the best I have seen in recent years.

Anyway, this is a very, very dark version of this particular fairy-tale; very dark indeed. I am at a bit of a loss as to how to classify it. It most certainly is not a horror picture as there is really very little to be frightened of. To call it a movie of ""terror"" is stretching the definition of terror a bit far in my opinion. Yes, there is blood, death and some rather disturbing scenes, but nothing that I would call over the top. I suppose if you stick to the premise of just what a ""fairy-tale"" is, you would be pretty safe. These old folk tales where made to scare children; and indeed adults, into doing what was write. They were passed on word of mouth from generation to generation before they saw print. They were told around the fire at night to show the fate of those who break the rules or willfully follow their base human nature. They were meant to teach that there were some very dire consequences for bad behavior. This movie most certainly does the job fairy-tales were made for.

For me this was a completely different version of this old tale but one that is just as valid of the dozen or more I have seen or read. I was entertained and to be quite frank, that is the only reason I really watch movies for.

922023,4,630464972X,"What I've read and heard about the brothers Grimm suggests to me that this rendition of Snow White is closer to their vision than that portrayed by Disney.

In this version Lilli's (Snow White) mom, pregnant with Lilli, has died from injuries sustained when their coach tumbles off the road. They were able to save Lilli. A few years later her father (Sam Neill) is remarrying to Claudia (Sigourney Weaver). Lilli is resentful and something is afoot with Claudia. The relationship between the two women becomes more strained over the years and Claudia is resolved to get rid of Lilli and bring the entire estate, along with her husband, down.

This is a pretty creepy flick. I'm not certain of the exact story behind Claudia. The mirror plays an important part. It's like a Dorian Grey/vanity thing. But during one address she invokes her mother and asks what she thinks of the distance her daughter has come in life and stature. What's with that!? But she is a witch. She can cast spells and drive various sources of nature. She's scary in an unstable mind kind of way. Lilli is a bit of a brat which posed problems for me later in the movie. When she escapes being hunted in the woods by Claudia's men, and gets lost is when she meets the seven. One is a dwarf but as a band they live on the outside. They work a mine, have poor living quarters and are dirty, mean and resentful of authority. She treats them with disdain and they want her for the ransom she'll bring. So when she become compassionate toward them and starts to fall for the Gill Bellows member of the group, it seems out of character and rushed.

This is generally a good movie. It has a good look and feel to most of it. Some of the sets aren't up to par and some of the wardrobe looks too much like costumes. Simon Boswell handles the music so it's up to snuff. It's just a bit disjointed for me. It needed a bit more time to let things happen and some smoothing out of the script. Weaver gives the strongest performance. Monica Keena is Okay as Lilli. Sam Neill has long worn out his welcome with me so I cannot comment on his performance. Gill bellows is decent enough in a role that doesn't give him much room to breathe. A big surprise for me is the director. Michael Cohn only directed 3 movies of which this was the third. What happened to him. There seems to be plenty of talent here? Did he fall off the face of the earth?

I can kind of see why it's not very popular. I think I vaguely remember it from years ago but it's not a movie anyone seems to remember or know of. I can't remember if this was in theaters or just on video.

I think Weaver did a great job as the queen but the film was too slow, dark and boring to me. Scenes switched here and there and a lot of the film was very confusing. I watched it twice to make sure I was giving it a chance but I just couldn't get myself to like it. The acting was very good and the characters were okay but the film itself was just too slow.

I was surprised I didn't like it since I love period movies based on classic tales but this didn't do it for me. Also the story was supposed to be scary and it wasn't. It looked more like a vehicle to showcase Weaver's skills at playing evil than to focus on the story. They showed the queen more than Snow White which really threw me off.

This wasn't my thing but I won't say others shouldn't watch it. Maybe this is one of these films that comes down to matter of opinion. Some people might think it's great and others will not be able to stand it. This film might do well with lovers of Shakespeare-like tales. Check it out for yourself and make up your own mind.

But on the whole, there are far more cons and it is hard to know where to start. First off, you know the story very well by now and it isn't very different. There is more background and the dwarfs are more sinister, well made to be more sinister but I didn't care for their peasant struggle and how poor the lower class was. Then there is the dead child being a ghoul and what happened to the servants, wait one came back and was a zombie? What ever happend in between? This movie throws in pieces and pieces like if you started with the original story and then attached scary parts to it willy nilly so it became just that a story with attachments instead of something new, let alone a good story.

Shake it up and down, turn it inside out, use consummate professional actors and actresses, have great sets that include a forest, and then take considerable poetic license.  Having said that, this 1997 version of Snow White had some incredible creativity, impressively thought out adaptations (including what they did with the magic mirror - this version has it as part of an ornate wardrobe cabinet instead of the oval depiction typical to most sets for Snow White), and although there is absolutely zero chemistry between Sam Neill and Sigourney Weaver, there isn't supposed to be.  It was a marriage of nobility and propriety, not one of love or passion.  Sigourney plays the role of Lady Claudia, the evil stepmother, and although I find Sigourney otherwise profoundly attractive, she exudes repulsiveness in this film just like it is meant to be done - even before her transformation into the old crone (witch).  Sam Neill has a clueless character part that appears dull and weak, but again, that is what was meant to be portrayed.  There is no real steal-the-show, stand out performance that leaves all the others behind, and somehow there seems to be a flux of camaraderie among the cast that buoys this film along wondrously.  It definitely isn't for anyone who is easily given nightmares, for there is believable evil and foreboding nastiness beyond anything Walt Disney would have sanctioned.  But, if you want a fresh perspective on a classic story, this film definitely is a banquet in that direction.  Not to put too fine a point on it, I found myself wanting the ornate wardrobe cabinet, but without the magic and evil.  Great costumes, great set, great acting, and well written.

I admit I'm a great fan of hers and if you like her, you'll love her in this story.

Sam Neill plays the part of the father. He does a fair job of playing this part. I don't know if the script was written this way, but he seemed pretty milk toast to me. I expected more of a man than this. He seems pretty mamby pamby as the father. That's just my impression of him.

To be honest I bought the movie because of Sigourney Weaver and the theme of the movie. Sometimes I like darker stories and this one really caught my eye.

If you like my review then you should at least watch this movie or go rent it, and decide if you want to buy it. If you don't like my review then watch it anyway and make up your own mind. I wanted this in my library so I bought it.

922187,3,630464972X,"Overall I very much enjoyed ""Snow White, A Tale of Terror"". I thought that the acting and cinematography were excellent. I love the dark, gothic atmosphere of the film. Sigourney Weaver did an excellent job as the increasingly mad witch, Lady Claudia. I have three main points of contention with the film:

1. The accents! This film has such a realistic look and feel of the middle ages. However the actors speak in American accents! They should have cast British actors or at least insisted that the cast speak in British accents. That would have been much more appropriate.

2. Monica Keena is miscast as Lilliana/Snow White. Snow White should be a gorgeous young woman on the cusp of adulthood. Monica Keena is too short, does not have a womanly figure, and as cute as she is, she is simply not pretty enough to play Snow White. Overall she is too girlish.

3. Sam Neill as the nobleman father of Snow White. In keeping with the original story, the production should have kept him a King, not merely a nobleman. Additionally, I found Sam Neill to be a rather dull choice for his role. I would have preferred a younger, more handsome and romantic actor. He simply does not seem like someone who would inspire such obessive love and devotion in Lady Claudia.",1256256000,,1259,4.63677130044843
922188,4,630464972X,"Make certain that the kids are safely tucked away in bed before popping this movie into the DVD player...

SNOW WHITE: A TALE OF TERROR (1997) is allegedly based on the ""Snow White"" fairytale as it was originally set down by the Brothers Grimm; though I suspect that very little of what you'll see on the screen will remind you of any Snow White you've ever heard or experienced before.

When he wife dies in premature childbirth (brought on by a carriage accident), Lord Friedrich Hoffman (Sam Neill) takes on the lovely Lady Claudia (Sigourney Weaver) as his second wife.  All goes well until Hoffman's daughter Lilliana (played as a child by Taryn Davis) grows into a stunning young woman (Monica Keena) whose beauty and shining innocence threatens the vice-like grip which Claudia holds over her husband and the entire court.

When Claudia's only child is delivered stillborn, she blames Lilly for her baby's death and the estrangement of Friedrich's affections.  Following a grisly attack on her life, Lilly flees into the forest where she's taken in by a group of miners (of which only one is a dwarf); but Claudia's magic mirror will never let her escape the wrath of the spurned stepmother...

Dark, intense, moody and quite gory in places, this SNOW WHITE won't be everyone's cup of tea, but I appreciated the Germanic storybook look of the piece, and the sensational performances of Weaver and Keena, adding a realistic flavour to their characters; this is a particularly brave turn from Ms Weaver.  Gil Bellows (""Ally McBeal"") throws away any prissy pretense and gives us a fairytale hero with lots of sweaty, masculine energy.

922191,5,630464972X,"I watched this along with some other film adaptations of Snow White for a class I'm taking on Grimms Tales,and this is my favorite of all the movies I've seen in that class so far,so much so that I came to this page scoping out my own copy!

What you need to know about this movie is that

a.)It's NOT intended for children
b.)It follows the Grimms version more closely than the Disney version,which most of us are used to thinking of as the canonical story,and
c.)It goes out of it's way to be scary and sexual.

As far as A goes,look at the rating and the reasons for it to decide if it's for you(although I'll say now,the most gory part comes at the very beginning of the movie,with the death of Lily's biological mother).With regards to B,look for themes of rivalry between the stepmother and stepdaughter,rather than the victimization of an innocent,dumb little girl in the Disney version;three trials where the Queen attempts to kill Snow White instead of just hopping right to the apple;and more complexity in the plot than in the Disney cartoon. As far as C,I'm not a horror buff at all,and I'm rather prudish,but I thought both elements were done mildly compared with a lot of the things available to audiences now and that they made the story a lot more interesting than the innocent,insipid children's versions.

You won't find singing dwarves here;they've been replaced by patrons that the Grimms could have chosen from the oral versions of the story they collected,but didn't:robbers. And the robbers are initially hostile to Lily,threatening her with physical harm several times and scorning her for her nobility. The Prince is kind of a dork and not effectual enough for our modern feminist heroine to rely on solely. And the rivalry between Lily and her stepmother is clearly played out;Lily has resented Claudia since they met and the two have power stuggles and compete for the father's attention. Lily is initially the cruel one in this relationship,but then the tables turn,and Claudia goes mad in a manner that is portrayed as sympathetic,but still clearly posits her as the aggressor and Lily as the victim. And my favorite aspect of this version is the romantic element,which is a refreshing new look on a question students of the Grimms story often ask--but I won't say any more here,since having it revealed in the movie is part of what makes this version so cool.;-)

Overall,I'd say this is a highly enjoyable version for older audiences that stays closer to the original story but gives the viewer food for thought on it's own. Highly reccomended!",1236384000,8,2575,4.816742081447964

922256,5,630464972X,"""Snow White"" has always been my favorite Grimms Brothers fairy tale.  The story is rich in imagery and examines rivalry between parents and children and a young girl's awakening to maturity.  ""Snow White - A Tale of Terror"" is a frightening an realistic examination of this familiar tale.  Be warned, this version is not for children! The writers utilize scenes from the original Grimms story, which was not meant for children anyway.  Instances of cannibalism, gore, and torture are graphically portrayed.  This movie plumbs the psychological depths of the fairy tale and the characters are far from being ""cookie cutter"" models.  Each character is developed very well and they are not all good or all evil.
The primise of this movie concerns a nobleman, Frederic Hoffman, and his wife Lilliana.  After a carriage accident, Lilliana is near death.  She pleads with her husband to save their unborn baby, and he performs a searean section.  The child survives although the mother loses her life.  A few years pass, and Fredric marries again.  Lady Claudia (Sigurney Weaver), is a well-intentioned woman who strives to make her husband happy.  However, from the beginning Frederic's little girl, Lilliana, resents her stepmother.  As the years pass, the resentment and hostility between the two females grows: finally culminating in Claudia's giving birth to a stillborn child.  Claudia learns she can no longer have children, and her irrational mind, caught within the throes of mental anguish, immediately blames Lilli.  Spurred on by an evil  mirror which belonged to her eccentric mother, Claudia orders her mute brother, Gustav, to take the now teenaged Lilliana into the forest and kill her.  But wait! You think you know the rest of the story? Think again! In this version, as in real life, Prince Charming's are few and far between, and ""little men"" cannot always come to the rescue.  It is up to Lilli to rescue herself!
The acting in this movie is magnificent! Sigurney Weaver is exceptional as the ""wicked stepmother,"" taking the word ""evil"" to a whole new level! Monica Keana does a wonderful job portraying Lilliana: a ""Snow White"" with an edge.  The other performers are just as excellent.
""Snow White - A Tale of Terror"" is surprisingly moving.  If you want to see a suspenseful movie that will make you think, please give this film a chance.  Happy viewing!",1208304000,4,2372,5.0
922257,4,630464972X,"A phenomenal fairy-tale retelling worth seeing at least once. The movie begins with the death of ""Snow White""s mother, whose husband is forced to perform a c-section to save his unborn child. Then we are taken years later to the child Lilli (Snow White) playing outside and listening to her maid tell the famous story of her mother pricking her finger and seeing her blood spill on the white snow. Lilli meets her stepmother-to-be and takes an instant disliking to her, which already does away with the perfect-girl scenario that exists in most Snow White tales.

Years pass, and the relationship between Lilli and her stepmother Claudia remains rocky. Sigourney Weaver does an excellent job portraying the human stepmother who is eventually consumed by evil and her own vanity. Contrary to popular belief here, I don't beleive she had magic powers of her own. The mirror is clearly portrayed to be pure evil before tensions reach their climax between the two women. I think the mirror is the true villian in this movie, and its evil preys on Claudia's vanity and grief, driving her to insanity. In a way, she's as much a victim as Lilli is.

There is also a hint of jealousy between Lilli and her stepmother over Lilli's father. In many fairytales, sexual themes between young girls and their fathers are common. I'm not saying Lilli was interested in her father in any way, but if one looks for it, one can see the references to WHY these stories were told in the first place. In Snow White, one theme is a struggle between the young girl, who's only male figure is her father, and the stepmother, who must take charge of the house and family as well as providing a son. A maturing girl who's only known her father will not willingly give him up, and a woman who must prove her place in the family against seemingly unfair odds will not be diverted by a girl.

Claudia's jealousy of Lilli is seen at the ball, where Lilli and her father dance, and she loses her baby. This is where insanity hits, and after the famous first killing attempt (by Claudia's brother), Lilli flees into a forest and finds shelter with seven wrongly convicted outlaws who hope to find survival through mining. Here's where the supernatural comes into play (the next two killing attempts are different from the original story yet add a terrifying thrill to the movie) and finally, there's the classic poisoned apple, Lilli's awakening (not by means of a kiss, thank God) and a final confrontation with Claudia.

Although the acting, music, and cinematic effects create a dark and creepy tone, there are still some holes that I think the directors should have filled, some things that aren't really explained that provide some head-scratching. The ending wasn't horrible, but it was rushed and left something to be desired. Overall, it was a sastifying movie experience, albeit in kind of a chilling way, and its a shame this never made it to the big screen.",1206576000,5,2935,4.737769080234834

Later she is awakened by ""prince charming"" ......and then returns to face her stepmother.

Very good movie with Sigourney Weaver, a beautiful dresser, and zombie-like servants.  The ""dwarves"" were turned into a band of runaway criminals (with unfair convictions). Behind it all there is a little bit of romance,  a little bit of suspense and some general creepiness.

Up until the middle, the movie presents the tale with a realistic twist in the sense that the step mother does not have supernatural powers.  At first it seems like she just went insane and paranoid.  The step mother miscarries a child, which gives her a mental break where she starts talking to mirrors and accusing everyone of conspiracy, etc.

Around this time, the movie goes down a little and they spin it into the typical fantasy/witchcraft tale.  As it turns out, the step mother does possess magical powers that she uses against snow white.  This in itself isn't too terrible because that's how the well-known story goes.

I would not recoment this movie for children, there are no cute dwarves just a couple of bandits and thieves etc. However, there have been many different written versions of this story before the brothers Grimm made it popular.

The truth is, this movie is the closest to what the original fairy tales were.  They were pretty horrific, full of things we would never dream of putting in them now.

This movie, however, returned to a more epic story, where the characters were given actual names, like Snow White was named Lilliana and the evil queen was named Claudia.  They were not one-sided, as someone else mentioned.  Lilliana was a bit of a spoiled brat, while Claudia went mad due to an event that Lilliana herself accidentally caused.

The beginning of the story offers a more complicated and more plausible explanation for Lady Claudia's hatred for Lilyanna. And while I found the beginning of the movie excellent, the ending was lacking.  The story could have been ended with the same creative twist with which it began.  Instead the last thirty minutes of the movie was an over-horrified bloodbath incorporating images from all sorts of terror films, like ""Cujo"", ""Night of the Living Zombies"", and ""Rosemary's Baby"".

It is a dark tale coming from the dark past that we call dark because it believed in the devil and in its constant and permanent presence one way or another. Magic was necessarily black magic and the marvellous necessarily was antichristian and satanic. The story is in no way surprising except for the people who have only encountered Disneyland Snow White in their life. Reality is slightly more perverse. The great power of this film is purely artistic : the lights, the setting, the special effects, and the horror that is always clearly stated and never really shown, leaving a great share of work to your own imagination. Horror for sure but no gore. In such a film stepping from reality into fantasy, from normality into horror is happening without you even knowing it or feeling it. One moment your are in normal life, the next moment you are in a fantastic world. Nothing as chnaged and yet a small detail, the lights, the sound track, a noise, nothing really and yet. When the witch is looking at herself in her magic mirror, at times we know which is the real witch and which is the reflection, but at other times we just don't know any more and I am even sure that at times we are wrong and the reflection looks more real than the real face. That is what good fantasy is : so much part of real life that we can't differenciate real life from imagination and hallucination. The objective is clear : to produce in us the conviction that horror is part of our daily life and that we don't even know about it because horror is just as real as all the rest, horror is part of our real life. Which means in the end that there is no escape from horror, only the necessity for us to be ready and prepared for it.

922404,5,630464972X,"I wasn't ""terrified"" by this movie, but I do love it for what it is.  The setting and costumes are charming and artistic, the casting very appropriate.  The dark tone to the film is somewhat haunting, and yet at the same time there is an enchanting elegance to it.  The native forest scenery is particularly breathtaking, and the castle presents itself as both lovely and ghastly.

The movie is altogether a welcome change from cloying animated fairy tales.  I'm proud of this movie for going in the Grimm Brothers direction, and asserting that a story like ""Snow White"" is not necessarily meant exclusively for children, if at all.

Some may think Sigourney Weaver as the stepmother was over the top, or rather that the character was written to be too over the top.  However, the viewer must remember that this is a fairy tale--it's meant to be over the top (particularly when madness is involved!).  Fairy tales are defined by their use of magical elements in telling a story.  This telling of the story manages to employ especially the use of the supernatural as a means of illustrating, with horrific hyperbole, the dangers of obsessive vanity and jealousy, emphasizing the versatility of fairy tale motifs.

I highly recommend this film for lovers of authentic fairy tales.  Don't watch it expecting to be scared, but rather creeped out in a Grimm Brothers sort of way.  Also, don't expect to be awfully surprised--there are plenty of plot twists in this movie that some find surprising, and others find contrived.  However, in the end, you don't need to be surprised when you're watching a fairy tale, for these are stories nearly as old as time.  A fairy tale newly told is more an experience of one person's artistic interpretation than a new story, and this movie is an admirable example of such.",1110412800,12,1805,4.799352750809062

922407,5,630464972X,This is by far the best version of the classic fairy tale ever created.  Sigourney Weaver is fantastic as Snow White's evil sorcereress step-mother - driven to madness by the thurst to be flawless.,1086652800,4,197,4.794117647058823
922408,3,630464972X,"This version of the classic story stars Sigourney Weaver and Sam Neill and is far from the cheery animated version you may be familiar with..
Sam Neill plays Lillian's father.  After the death of his wife he marries Sigourney Weaver.  Things are fine at first but the aging Weaver begins to feel jealousy towards her step-daughter.  She feels she is in competition for her husband's affections.  With the help of her mysterious magic mirror (a frightening piece of furniture if I ever saw one) she begins making plans to be number one.
But as Weaver makes her plans she also begins to sink into deeper and deeper madness as she eliminates the servants, her step-daughter and even her brother.  But Lillian manages to survive and meets a band of outlaw miner's hoping to find a rich strike.  She manages to win their hearts in time and eventually returns to challenge her step-mother.
This is a very dark telling of the Snow White story.  It is more tragic than many tellings in that the step-mother is mad and not evil.  The girl who plays Lillian is excellent.  Her ability to show powerful emotion with a single look really adds to the atmosphere of this dark film.
If you are interested in seeing a good dark tale then Snow White could be just what you are looking for.",1085702400,56,1272,4.592920353982301
922409,5,630464972X,"The Grimm fairy tales were written to teach children and adults lessons. They were created not to have happy endings, but teach a lesson on life. If we were to go back to the days we would see all our beloved Disney fairytales with gruesome endings.
This movie puts the Grimm tale into a realistic view of the story. It's completed without the chintzy blood and guts of horror/slasher films, but with the subtle and dark gothic images from the scenes in the forest to those heightened events in the castle.
Sigourney Weaver was excellent in this film because her portrayal of the evil Queen made you hate her and feel for her at the same time. It's almost as if the circumstances are what made her act the way she did. It's not your children's fairy tale. It is a dark movie told the way it was told when it was originally written.
I really enjoy films that make you think and draw you in. This film was excellent. However, if you are looking for a horror film with lots of blood, guts, gore and fighting typical of a slasher/horror film - this is not the movie for you. If you like a good storytelling with a few twists in magic and character, you will love this movie.",1081382400,2,1170,4.34703196347032
922410,2,630464972X,"Either I just don't get it, or my spookiness threshold is too demanding :-)
Sigourney in a warped and twisted rendition of the classic fairy tale - sounded like just what my therapist ordered me to watch on a rainy night. So having waited until the mood was right and darkness had fallen all around, and combed down the hairs on the back of my neck in anticipation, I plugged in the disk and sat back, ready for the goosebumps.
It couldn't have started out better, with dark woods and snarling wolves and terrified horses and carriages and miscarriages and Poe-sque manors.. I settled deeper into the couch and pushed my popcorn a notch away to make sure I wouldn't knock it over if I got too startled.
And then the movie was over. Perhaps Siggy was called over to focus on Alien Resurrection, and stop wasting her time on fairy tales. The rest of the movie seemed like a waste of time and celluloid. I couldn't blame them for trying, but it never got more than a lifted eyebrow from me. Too formulated, too sterotypical gothic, too predictable, too well defined, too belabored. There were tons of opportunities to make your skin crawl - the witch makeover, the mutely sinister Gustaf, the creaky mirror cabinet, getting lost in an eerie forest, medeival castles and dungeons. But the director only succeeded in making it all too iconic, too futile, too contrived. In the end, there is nothing very remarkable when you tout a different 'spin' of a well-told tale, but good being good and bad being bad and the former triumphing over the latter in just precisely the way you would expect.
I see all the other glowing reviews of this movie, and wonder if there is something I missed. Perhaps. But a good movie shouldn't let you miss anything. It should hold you with a glittering eye. As did Alien. 1, 2, and Resurrection (well, almost). Even when I watch them today for the nth time. To be brutal - I think Sigourney was wasted. Perhaps if they threw in a couple of toothy phantasms and oozed some slime around, the movie could've been redeemed.
You don't need a magic mirror to tell you this one isn't the fairest of them all.",1078790400,2,2126,4.553524804177545
922411,4,630464972X,"The cutesy Disney cartoon this ain't.  Although the BASIC story structure remains, SNOW WHITE: A TALE OF TERROR is an interpretation that is much closer in tone and mood to the original somber tale by the Brothers Grimm, and in many ways it is actually even darker.  Instead of a kiddie flick, then, what director Michael Cohn and crew serve up is a top-notch gothic horror film.
In this gloomier version of the famous fable, many of the familiar elements are wryly skewed.  For example, the seven men who house the heroine (here called Lilliana, or Lilli, rather than Snow White) during her sojourn in the forest are not cutsie dwarves--although one is actually dwarfish--but are instead a bunch of grubby, ruffians who earn their living working mines.  At first they want to use the girl to obtain a ransom from her wealthy father, but they soon develop a sort of fatherly affection for her.  Another clever twist occurs when the hero revives Lilli after she has fallen comatose from eating the cursed apple.  Instead of awakening her with an enchanted kiss, he repeatedly pushes on her midriff out of desperation, thereby dislodging the piece of fruit with a sort of primitive version of the Heimlich Maneuver.  Such changes in narrative and characterization are perceptively clever and make the tale much more realistic and believable than its animated ancestor.  However, despite this deliciously sardonic tweaking, remaining at the story's core is its familiar and enduring moral, to wit, that basic goodness will always triumph over hatefulness and vanity because the latter are ultimately self-destructive.
In the role of the wicked stepmother (as well as her evil mirror's reflection), Sigourney Weaver delivers a superbly malevolent performance as she schemes to destroy her beautiful stepdaughter.  The lovely Monica Keena--most recently seen by horror fans playing the buxom Lori Campbell in 2003's FREDDY VS. JASON--does a very affecting job as the object of Weaver's disdain (i.e., Lilli), and Gil Bellows is very convincing and interesting as the hero and tacit love interest.  Sam Neill does a fine job as the heroine's mostly clueless father, and the film's realism is further bolstered by outstanding supporting performances from talents like Brian Glover, Frances Cuka, David Conrad, Anthony Brophy, Christopher Bauer, and numerous others.
With SNOW WHITE: A TALE OF TERROR, director Michael Cohn and scripters Tom Szollosi & Deborah Serra recreate the tenebrous tone of the Grimm Brother's original story while, at the same time, they subtly thumb their noses at the saccharine, white-washed Disney interpretation.  Mike Southon's beautiful cinematography is deliberately on the warm side of the spectrum, generating a autumnal ambiance perfectly suited to the plot.  And the creative art direction by Peter Russell, outstanding pseudo-medieval production design of Gemma Jackson, and clever ""period"" costume designs from Marit Allen and Charles Knode add detail to the film that greatly enhances both the spooky ambiance and the fairy-tale quality of this twisted fable.
The DVD from Universal Studios Home Video offers a clean, crisp digital transfer in the original widescreen aspect ratio of 1.85:1.  (Alas, it is only letterbox widescreen and not anamorphic, but it still looks beautiful.)  The only real bonus feature is a trailer for the film, which curiously identifies it using one of its numerous alternate titles.  The disc is very reasonably priced, though, so fans of old-fashioned gothic horror or grim Grimm fairy tales are hereby advised to add SNOW WHITE: A TALE OF TERROR to their collections.",1078790400,112,3631,5.257785467128028
922412,5,630464972X,"Monica Keena is the INCREDIBLY beautiful Lilliana, daughter of a newly remarried nobleman/widower (played by Sam Neill), and living in a European land just coming out of the medieval era. Lilli's new stepmother, Claudia (Sigourney Weaver), is obsessed with her own vanity, in more ways than one. She is determined that no one around her will be as attractive as she, or steal her new husband's attention away from her for even a moment. Soon, Claudia is with child, and when the baby is born dead, Claudia places all her anger and blame on Lilli. In her distraught condition, a new character emerges to take advantage of the situation. Something evil lives within the doors of Claudia's heirloom Vanity. Her mother's wicked mirror begins to tempt and guide Claudia into a life of cruelty and witchcraft. In no time, she has Lilli running for her life at every turn. The lovely young girl soon finds herself living with a nest of outcasts in the forest who spend their days working in a mine and their nights in unrest. At first, they are cruel to the girl whom they see as a spoiled ""princess,"" but after saving her more than once, and at much sacrifice, they grow to love her. But the wicked Claudia has a final trick up her sleeve: an apple that will put Lilli in her coffin and test the loyalty of her newfound friends.

Snow White: A Tale of Terror, is one of the best versions of the classic fairytale I have ever seen (second only to the Disney telling)! Without discarding the black magic, this live-action Snow White story takes a much more realistic view on the events of the well-known fable. The film works perfectly as both a fairytale, AND a scary movie (yes, it gets pretty intense at times), thanks to the rare and enchanting charm and beauty of Monica Keena and the outstanding performance of Sigourney Weaver. You've never seen such a wicked stepmother as this! The characters are developed in such realistic ways without leaving unanswered questions of why they feel the things they feel. The entire film is totally believable. Beautifully shot in perfect locations with wonderful sets and costumes, this movie is a feast for the eyes as much as a thrilling adventure. Add this to your DVD shelf between Ever After and the Cannon Movie Tales! You won't regret it!",1075766400,6,2281,4.688279301745636

Unlike Disney's take on it, this film left me interested enough to go out and buy it.  The characters have depth, the villains have a grieving side that makes you almost pity them, and the heroine isn't perfect, but is likeable and accepting.  Plus you should see the Dwarves!  The only reason I give it four stars is because I did miss one scene of it after a commercial break I was late getting back from; a lot happened in that small amount of time.  All in all however, this is a movie worth seeing again, as you may be left having missed something the first time through, even if you do see it all at once.  I would recommend this movie to anyone with a love of fairytales, like of not-too-horrible horror movies, and a curiosity of the supernatural.",1063497600,2,854,4.512987012987013

Some folks are comparing this to the original Snow White tale, well that isn't really true this doesn't have too much to do with the Grimms faiy tale either it is more like what was done with Ever After. (although much scarier) a sort of what if Snow White were real. Not even all the ""magic"" is real but sort of trick of ancient herbology.

The performances of younger actors, Snow White and her darling, are not as wonderful - they seem to be there mostly for the scenery. Then again, this movie is mostly about scenery, of particular kind: blood, guts, hearts, and poisoned apples (how could I forget about that!)

922460,3,630464972X,"Snow White Tale of Terror is an exceptional movie in many ways. The first is the performances of Gil Bellows, and Sigourney Weaver. Sigourney  portrays the evil step-mother beautifully, form her initial kindness shown  towards Lilli (Snow White is renamed Lilliana), and her hatred after she  blames Lilli from her child being still born. She exudes depth and darkness  and hate. She never overdoes it, but adds the right amount of mysterious  intrigue, with the right amount of physicaly violence. Gil Bellows is  another strong actor, protraying an  ''excommunicated'' dwarf named Will  beautifully. He is mysteriously quiet, and strangely haunting as a man  scarred by fire having watched his family crucified by Crusaders. (This  takes place in the 1330s). He is heartbreaking. Monica Keena does a good  job as Lillianna, quite a contrast to her other roles. She plays a spoiled  rich girl, who changed upon meeting Will. All in all, this film is dark,  gothic, horror-filled, yet mysteriously sweet at time (the relationship  between Lilli and WIll as an example).
