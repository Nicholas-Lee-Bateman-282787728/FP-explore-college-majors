8714380,5,B00WUKI0IC,"I find this to be the best version of Carmen available.  Carmen is especially captivating, as her voice and facial expressions convey the seduction better than any low cut or high slit dress  ever could.  The first time I watched it, I had no translation, and found a brief synopsis of what each act entailed.  The acting of all involved - not to mention the voices, made me feel the story instead of ""reading"" it.  Highly recommend.",1528502400,,433,4.571428571428571
