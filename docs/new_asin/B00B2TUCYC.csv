5553279,3,B00B2TUCYC,"This is a review of the set and not the anime or the seller.

I really didn't care for the case itself, at least not 60$ care for it. The case is recycled plastic and seems kinda fragile. The 13 episodes are on 2 discs that are actually pretty cool looking (they arrived in good condition). The subtitles are bigger than necessary and bright yellow. The English audio is... well, its a dub. They of course used Monica Rial.

If I had seen a few screen shots of the subtitles or listened to some clips of the dub, I can't say I would have purchased it.",1365897600,4,551,4.188679245283019
5553280,4,B00B2TUCYC,"What can you say about an anime based on an ongoing manga that looks at the supernatural through the lens of two principle characters that hate themselves yet are trapped by their demonic ancestry?  Both creepy and cute, arousing yet ridiculous, Inu X Boku SS is not a series for everyone.

This DVD collection offers all 12 episodes from the series along with another ""episode"" that appears to be three shorts that I had never seen before.  The shorts do require that you see the series to fully understand but no one in the client-agent class of residents from this apartment complex is left out.  These shorts also touch upon later issues of the first manga series.

Personally I found the English voice actors to be good but there were a few awkward moments when they spoke over each other and a voice seemed out of place; that's an issue for the English version director.  The subtitled version does not seem to have these issues.

A very unusual romance with absurdity and a touch of kink makes this not for children but perhaps also not for every adult.  Check out the premise and a few clips before you buy so you aren't disappointed.",1365811200,19,1142,4.5911330049261085
5553281,5,B00B2TUCYC,I think this is a very cute anime. I found the manga in English online and the anime does well to copy it.,1365120000,,106,3.652173913043478
5553282,2,B00B2TUCYC,"While there are many very good series awaiting their turn to be marketed here,it is sad this sorry series made it instead. While the premise of the story is good and much empathy can be had for the plight of Shrakiin,the main character,this lame attempt at a Cyrano de Bergerac storyline falls flat as there is not only simply nothing of any value to having a relationship to an admitted liar and,on every level a fraud,this Nine-Tailed Fox acting as her bodyguard is so nausuating in his syrupy approach to his servide that one become put off very early in the series.
More than one episode has ""soon to be 16"" Rircho's hereto finacee',a jerk old enough to be her father,and a real S&M freak,trying to spin all relationships as forms of S&M.
Well before the halfway point in this sad series one is hoping beyond hope that she finally wises up and rids herself from the syrupy-sickness of the 23-year-old  ""bodyguard"" and the S&M freak...don't hold your breath.
Disappointing especially since there was much that could have been otherwise done with the cast of characters and this storyline,the outcome must have from deep in the recesses of a sad person.",1362528000,4,1155,4.746268656716418
5553283,5,B00B2TUCYC,"This is a great Anime that is more unexpected then typical fantasy comedy romance ones.  The story starts with Ririchyo a Girl who comes from a very wealthy family whom is sent to live in a special Hotel with other special wealthy people who each get their own Personal Body Guard.  This one starts very typical with a few silly moments put in here and there.  Until it gets to a point where some would be thieves decide to rob the residents.  Its then revealed that the reason for the tight security and the Body Guards is not to Protect the Residents from the outside, but actualy to protect the outside from the Residents.  Every Resident and Body Guard are not what they seam and are actualy quite powerful and dangerous if they want to be.  In addition to this revelation, the viewers are also introduced to a budding love story between Ririchyo and her would be Body Guard.  What makes this an excellent series is how it introduces the Audience to all the characters.  A background is given for all of them to give them all depth.  This allows a viewer to understand the point of view of each character no matter who they are.  Also an excellent attention to detail from one episode to the next is kept. What i mean by this is that if there is damage or something happens in a previous episode, this is recalled later which has an effect on the later epsiodes.  Each episode is mostly encapsulated story wise so that the viewer doesnt have to recall every single episode to keep up.  And the comedy is superb with its flare of making fun of differing character types.  It should be noted though that this series has a story that does not follow the Comic/Manga exactly.  In essense its a retelling of the story in a differing way.  With superb Animations and dialogue this is a definate must watch for anyone who is interested Fantasy/Comedy/Romance genre animes.",1362528000,45,1869,4.537313432835821
5553291,4,B00B2TUCYC,This series was really fun with lots of great characters! I loved watching how all the different characters evolved throughout the series and I am planning on reading the manga series for this as well.,1468281600,,201,4.771428571428571

5553297,5,B00B2TUCYC,"Such an adorable and off-beat series! I don't usually love cute romances this much, but the combination of irreverent humor (the S&M references cracked me up!), wonderful art, and terrific vocal talent (the Japanese voices for the two MCs are fabulous) bumped this sweet story to the top of my all-time favorites. I've also been reading the manga, which is great and goes far past the ending to this part of the story. The twist at the end of the story is one of the best I've read and made me tear up.

Not to rehash the plot, but the mixture of paranormal creatures in a contemporary setting was fun and creative. I was heartbroken to hear that the mangaka who created this series died recently. We're fortunate she finished this series. She will be greatly missed!

If you love a sweet hurt-comfort romance that will make you laugh and cry (with happiness), you'll enjoy this off-beat love story.",1449100800,3,899,4.647798742138365
5553298,4,B00B2TUCYC,"Well the dub could be better but otherwise, I love this anime. It is available on Hulu for now so you may want to watch it there before purchasing. Its hilarious, has a great and interesting cast of characters, and one of my favorite anime love stories. Don't miss out!",1447718400,,269,4.4
5553299,4,B00B2TUCYC,Enjoyable. It didn't take itself too seriously which helped make it more enjoyable for people who may not be die-hard shojo fans. Fun folklore references,1444348800,,153,5.16

5553305,3,B00B2TUCYC,"I like this anime, I wish it was longer since it ended right when it was getting good. My only problem with this anime was the English dubbing. It was done by Sentai Filmworks and there is a reason they are not on my fave list. They actually Dubbed, which is somewhat rare from what I've seen out of them since they started. But the voice acting was weak. They talked so slow and sounded bored while reading their lines (Hard to call it acting) Some of the voice actors were good but the girls really annoyed me with how slow and mono-toned their dialog was.",1433376000,,558,4.273584905660377

5553322,4,B00B2TUCYC,"Very strange show, but I really enjoyed it! The humor was great, the weirdness of it all was quite refreshing too. I would not compare this at all to Kamisama Hajimemashita (that's why I got it, I read a lot online that said the 2 shows were comparable), as the only think I see that even comes close is the familiars' resemblence to each other (in looks only).

5553328,5,B00B2TUCYC,"Buy this collection now!  A little pricey, but I'm just discovering that animes and mangas are pricey in general.  SO glad I stumbled upon this gem.  If you love romance, you'll like this.  There are some inappropriate, sexual in nature, (but again I'm finding that this is very common in animes and mangas) comments and screen shots, but luckily few and far in between.  The age difference may bother some, she 16, he 22-23.  I'm glad the anime had a good ending. Darn some other posters who spoiled it regarding the ongoing manga with more dramas. The extra short piece, after the 12 completed episodes, was fun to watch.",1413072000,3,623,4.669724770642202
5553329,5,B00B2TUCYC,The package arrived the day of and there was no damage at all. I really liked the cover on this and the packaging was simple with a nice cover art of each master and servant on each disk. I really love this anime because they both contrast physically with her being petite and dark and he being tall and light. But they both need each other to feel and that is what gets to me.,1412812800,,377,4.04
5553330,5,B00B2TUCYC,"If you've read the manga, don't worry--this one stops at the romantic moment of truth. Very well done romance with enough of a twist to make it interesting, and hey--what woman doesn't want someone devoted to her body and soul? The Sadistic fiance is laugh-out-loud funny, but the character size can be a bit disconcerting--the difference comes across a bit too child-like on the female lead. Definitely a watch-more-than-once.",1412121600,,427,5.202898550724638
5553351,5,B00B2TUCYC,This was a great anime and is one of my favorites but some of the parts can be inappropriate but it is great nonetheless. It came in great condition and I'm very happy with my purchase.,1411084800,,185,4.166666666666667

5553354,4,B00B2TUCYC,"You can't go into this anime expecting the complexity of the manga series. It just isn't here. Ririchiyosama is still suffering from a lack of confidence in herself and a wariness of people but all the bigger issues (like why this group of people seem to fall into friendship and closeness so easily and why Miketsukamikun is really so slavishly devoted to his mistress) are all very shallowly depicted. Not to say that there aren't any cute moments. There are plenty of those and they are fun. Its just that by only depicting the romance portion from the prologue in the first three volumes you miss out on much of what makes the manga so sneaky good. I enjoyed the series and will watch it again, but it really just made me hungry for the next installment of the manga.",1409443200,,771,4.514285714285714
5553355,5,B00B2TUCYC,"This is a great anime, I would recommend it to anyone who loves a good romance story.  As far as romance anime goes, this is my first choice.  The characters are amazing and there are plenty of laughs all the way through.",1406937600,,221,4.238095238095238

5553391,5,B00B2TUCYC,"I just finished watching this OMG the humor is sooo good it cracks ya up big time, the plot nicely works it's way up to the romantic link up of the two main characters. This is a unique tale of an apartment building built for and inhabited by descendants of humans and various supernatural beings each has his and her own abilities

The lead male character Soushi looks human but is a 9 tale fox deity he is so beautiful in fox form the white fox ears and 9 tails on a human body dressed in traditional Japanese clothing from long ago his eyes are two different colors one is gold, and he swings a sword looking like a samurai. He is a secret service agent working in the building he is asigned to and meets Ririchiyo a beautiful petite fiery girl with amethyst colored eyes and very long black hair the two quickly become strongly attached to each other and inseperable

Making up the group of residents are a woman who can create ice by will alone, a guy who can turn into a cute little animal, and another something that looks like a very large sheet of black paper and others. Each of them has their own and history and unique lives, some were kept by famalies to bring wealth and money to the home, others were outcast, or rejected. Ririchiyo learns her fox Soushi has a very mysterious and surprising past and he reveals a big secret to her. This is an excellent blend of mystery comedy romance and a bit of drama mixed in on some parts

Reccomendation for another comical romantic fox meets girl anime

For those like myself who love foxes check out an amazing anime that goes great with this called [ Kamisama Kiss ] the lead male character Tomoe is priceles. Mikage the land god wants out and leaves the shrine while in the park he meets a recently abandoned by her father and evicted from her home because of his heavy gambling debts Nanami, Mikage offers to let her live in his house she's unaware however that because of the kiss he gave her she is replacing him as the land god that is where she meets Tomoe. There is also Kurama the charismatic fallen angel, school heart throb, and famous singer, Mizuki the snake deity who becomes the second familiar to Nanami is a lovable character kind and caring

Inu X Boku Secret Service ticked my boxes, it was very different to what I imagined I was going to by pass it, so glad I didn't.
The story really reflects the truth of how we feel in real life and how different situations or lack of social mixing mould us into
who we become. Our strengths and weakness define us and how we effect others without meaning to or knowing we have done
so.

I watched the 1st episode and had to see the rest from being to end and was by no means dissapointed by the characters,
story line, beautiful drawings which made up each episodes or english dubbing of the anime.
A MUST WATCH.

Chris.",1389657600,8,720,4.446969696969697
5553409,5,B00B2TUCYC,"I watch a lot of anime. Like, a lot, way more than the average fan would. I've seen pretty good shows, I've seen terrible shows, and I've seen shows that are amazingly good but severely underrated in my opinion. InuxBoku SS is one of those shows that doesn't get much attention, but oh boy does it deserve it.

Animation/Visuals:
For the most part, the visuals in the show are amazingly high quality, and the animation is extremely well done and fluid. The characters are all distinctive and the designs are really well put together. However i must make a special mention to the way that this anime focuses on Ririchiyo's eyes, as the subtle animations and mood changes just in her eyes is truly amazing and demonstrates her emotions perfectly, even when shes trying to hide something. The animation and visuals are just great. 9/10

Music:
The background music is well done and perfectly placed, but the opening is truly a showstopper. The melody is beautiful, the singing is pretty, the animation and visuals are gorgeous, and its just a great opener overall. The various endings that focus on each of the characters are all good songs, have good animation, and they are all mostly really comical and fun. Like the visuals and the animation, the music is really well done. 9/10

Voice Acting:
Japanese is great as it always is, so if you prefer that you definitely won't be disappointed. English dub wise though, its...generic to say the least. This is a Steven Foster produced dub, and if your familiar with him you understand me mentioning him. Basically, he adds slang where its not necessary, he warps some characterization and dialogue, and his voice cast choices are painfully generic and predictable. Okay seriously this is type casting at its finest, Hilary Haag is the tsundere girl, Chris Patton is the gentlemen who happens to be extremely handsome, Monica Rial is the cute one, Greg Aryes is the pre-pubescent boy, Shelly Callene-Black is the mature sophisticated woman, you catch my drift. Don't get me wrong there's nothing wrong with any of these actors, but for the love of god i have seen them all in the same role they're in here before like 10 times over, its ridiculous. The Japanese track is solid, but the English dub leaves a bit to be desired. 8/10

Story:
However much i praise this show, the true heart as well as the best part, is most definitely the story. Its just so chock-full of heart and great characters you end up caring for and just, the feeling portrayed by these characters are amazingly well done and feel-ridden. Ririchiyo in particular is a great character, and her portrayal is well done and you end up feeling for her sometimes. But lets not forget the comedy in the series, and while its not always in you face, its definitely there quite often. Some of my favorite moments in the series come from Miketsukami's obsession with Ririchiyo and how she reacts to it, which is often with a confused disgust. The side characters also do lead to a bit of comedy as well, and there were some moments that legit made me laugh out loud. Definitely the best part of the series is the story, with great characters and some really funny comedy. 10/10

FINAL THOUGHTS:
This show is really awesome. The characters are great, the story's great, the animation's great, the music is great, its just overall great in general. Coupled with the fact that this show has some great comedic elements and great art direction, this show is definitely one you should be checking out.
