5967357,5,B00F453IPK,"His passion to come to the aid of our magnificent, majestic wild horses is inspiring.  The success he seems to be having gives hope to these wonderful horses who have been abused and suffer at the hands of the BLM (Federal Government) which claims to be pursuing the best interests of the horse but know not how to take care of these horses at all.",1393372800,4,348,4.3538461538461535

5967364,5,B00F453IPK,This is a sad but very interesting TRUE book.. I recommend it to all that love horses.  My heart breaks for all the mistreated horses by this Government and these people at the BLM that work for them that doesn't understand the horses... I doubt that any of them sitting on their butts in Washington have ever ridden a horse. God will judge them for the pain and confusion they put these precious animals through.. They don't understand that these horses live in a family together and with these round ups many die and are injured plus they mix the herds and confused them so. The fear can be seen in their eyes as they try to flee for  their lives... Many spook even after being trained when they hear a plane or helicopter. Breaks my heart and make me angry to know this is happening to these mustangs that have a right to live on these lands.. But this is did because of the cattle raising greedy ranchers..,1474329600,,910,4.378698224852071

Anyone who has been there or plans to go should see this film.  What an interesting and gifted man and what a good thing he has done in establishing this place.  We pray the uranium mining will not be allowed to ruin this place, first for the horses, and secondly for everyone who has invested so much in the upkeep.",1420588800,8,482,4.382022471910112
